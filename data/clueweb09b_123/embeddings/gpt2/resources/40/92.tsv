The troops acted principally as a force to secure the island against any invasion by other European powers as well as to help protect other neighbouring British territories in the Eastern Caribbean from invasion. So successful were British colonial troop deployments to Barbados, it has been said that Barbados is the only country in the  Caribbean  region never to have changed hands since the British first landed and established the city of  Jamestown  (around the first quarter century of the 1600s) until independence.     [ edit ]   Today   Today as a fully independent country, Barbados has a moderate sized military command. This force is made up of the  Barbados Defence Force  (BDF) The  Barbados Ground Forces , the  Barbados Coast Guard , and the  Royal Barbados Police Force  (RBPF) in addition to other governmental command in the country. These forces together are administered under the office of the Barbados Prime Minister. These forces often act in concert to maintain law and order in the country as well as to route-out illegal activity and other threats to the country of Barbados. With the backing of the Eastern Caribbean's  Regional Security System  (RSS) Barbados has a framework for calling in a follow-on military command from other Caribbean islands as well and in the most severe of cases, from the larger International community.

Slaves worked  the sugar plantations established on the island until 1834 when slavery was abolished.  The economy remained heavily dependent on sugar, rum, and molasses production  through most of the 20th century. The gradual introduction of social and political  reforms in the 1940s and 1950s led to complete independence from the UK in 1966.  In the 1990s, tourism and manufacturing surpassed the sugar industry in economic  importance.     close to  Martinique ,  Saint  Lucia ,  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines ,   Trinidad and Tobago ,  Venezuela    related countries:  UK              Official Name:    Barbados     ISO Country Code :  bb       Time:  Local Time =  UTC   -4h   Actual Time:          Wed-Jan-7  08:54              Capital City:  Bridgetown     Government:    Type: Parliamentary democracy; independent sovereign state within the Commonwealth.

Known as the ""shipwreck capital"" of the Caribbean, Barbados offers    a number of unique and interesting diving and snorkeling features that include    a number of accessible sunken ships and a host of beautiful coral formations    and marine life.    The west coast has two designated snorkeling areas, both part of the Folkestone    Marine Park and the south coast’s best snorkeling area is the Carlisle    Bay Marine Park. The diving is easily accessible and not particularly technical,    and the island’s facilities are excellent, including a decompression chamber    situated near Bridgetown and many well-equipped dive centers found on the west    and south coasts.    The most famous of the wrecks, the Stavronikita, has created a fascinating    penetration dive for experienced divers.    Water temperature is a warm 82-84°F in the summer and 78-80°F in the    winter. Most people will find a 3mm suit adequate for diving in Barbados.

The south coast is    the place to be and the best time to hoist a sail is normally December through    mid-March.

Check with the Centers for Disease Control on recommended  vaccinations for travel  www.cdc.gov .    Culture and Customs    The Caribbean is full of people who are larger than life. Barbadians (Bajans)    are different from other caribbean personalities in many ways. They are more    spiritual and religiously conscious. They are by nature open, thoughtful and    generous. They love a party but will have time for anyone, they like people,    no matter what background, race, and disposition. They make time for quiet and    shy people and draw them out with disarming innocence and charm. They will rise    to the occasion on any occasion to shoot the breeze and laugh and joke with    the most outrageous personalities of our time. It is not at all ironic that    there are more churches per capita than most other island nations. The only    thing more numerous than churches are rum shops.    There are a few festivals to make note of. In mid February, there is the Holetown    Festival, which is a family attraction commemorating the first landing and settlement    in Barbados on February 17, 1627. The Holetown Festival combines folk, gospel    and medieval music with a street parade and fair and a torch-lit evening exhibition    by the Royal and Mounted Police forces as they perform the floodlit Tattoo.    Other activities include poetry, drama, sidewalk art shows, sports, games, local    handicrafts markets and the popular Queen of the Festival Pageant.   From the end of February through mid-March, you can take part in the Holders    Season festival. This most sophisticated festival offers an exciting season    of opera, classical, jazz, latin and caribbean music and takes place at the    historic Holders Plantation House, situated on a ridge overlooking what were    once extensive sugar and tobacco fields. The event, which is internationally    recognized and has attracted such musical luminaries as Luciano Pavarotti, is    currently focused on the development and exhibition of local talent.   Barbados is an island filled with artistic talent .... from skilled local potters    at work fashioning their wares as has been done for centuries, to modern fashion    designers, abstract artists and poets.   The people of Barbados have a history of long ingrained Christian principles,    a sound and free educational system with a literacy rate of 97%     Electricity, Telephone and Internet Access    Electricity in Barbados is 110 volts/50 cycles (hairdryers and shavers from    North America do not need a converter but if needed can usually be borrowed    from your hotel).   The island uses solar power mainly for hot-water systems.    Barbados has a modern telecommunications infrastructure with the latest in    digital technology and fiber optics systems including international direct dialing,    facsimile transfer and satellite telecommunications which allows for the efficient    transmission of electronic data.    Internet and e-mail services, as well as express mail and courier delivery,    are also available. The international direct long distance dialing code for    Barbados is (1–246), followed by a seven digit local number.    Water Quality    The water service in Barbados is reliable and the water supply is safe and    refreshing to drink straight from the tap.    Language & Currency    English is the official language of Barbados, although the Bajan dialect can    be heard all around the island.   The Barbados Dollar is converted at the rate of $1.98 BDS to $1.00 U.S. The    Barbados Dollar is fixed to the U.S Dollar and does not fluctuate. Its rate    to other currencies fluctuates daily based on their fluctuations relative to    the U.S. Dollar.   US currency is accepted across the island, and most stores and restaurants    accept major credit cards and travellers cheques. Most Barbados hotels, restaurants    and businesses will accept credit cards. Travelers cheques are also cashable    at many outlets.    There are many commercial banks in Barbados (mostly British and Canadian) and    most have ABMs (also known as ATM's) that will accept credit cards. They all    dispense funds in Barbados dollars at the current rate of exchange.    Time    4 hours behind GMT. 1 hour ahead of US Eastern Standard Time (EST) in the    winter and the same time as US Eastern Daylight Saving Time in the summer.    History, Art, and Culture    The history of Barbados is as rich and fascinating as the island itself. It    is believed that the island’s first inhabitants were the Amerindians,    who reached its shores around 1623 BC by open canoe from the Orinoco area of    South America, known today as Venezuela. The next 3,000 years brought the settlement    of several tribes, including the peaceful Arawaks and the cannibalistic Caribs.    At the whim of prevailing northeast trade winds, the Spanish and Portuguese    followed in 1537, calling the island “Los Barbados”— perhaps    a nod to their fascination with the hanging, aerial roots of the Bearded Fig    Tree.   By the time the first settlers–the British–chanced upon the island    by virtue of navigational miscalculations in 1627, the Indians had all but disappeared.    For the English, Barbados represented a golden opportunity to acquire a colony    with good potential for agriculture: favorable climate, rich soils and generally    flat land. These early pioneers set about the task of cultivating the land and    instigated a long period of English rule that was to last some 339 years.   The booming sugar industry and slave trade fueled the establishment of an excellent    infrastructure and Barbados’ own Parliament in 1639, making it the third    oldest in the British Commonwealth. Later, Barbados became the first country    to abolish the slave trade in 1834.   Barbados gained independence from Britain on the 30th November 1966 and has    since enjoyed over 40 years as a proudly independent nation.    Location and Size   Barbados is the easternmost island of the West Indies in the Atlantic Ocean.    The island is approximately 300 miles north of Venezuela. Barbados is 166 square    miles, divided into 11 parishes. It's captial city is Bridgetown, with a population    of approx. 99,000.    Although Barbados is a relatively small island (21 miles long and 14 miles    wide), there is much to explore so you should consider renting a car during    your Barbados vacation.   Driving in Barbados is on the left side of the road and the majority of vehicles    are “right hand drive.” The island has an extensive road network    of paved roads. A highway links the north and the south of the island. There    are a number of ways to get around the island by hired car, taxis and buses;    all are safe, reliable and convenient.

[ 1 ] . During this period, Barbados and the current  provinces of Canada  were a series of colonial possessions of  Great Britain  and  France . In the early most instances of trade between the two regions, Barbados and Canada found themselves able to fill niche markets between one another's markets. The  Bluenose  vessels were instrumental to trade as Barbados and other islands exported their  sugar  and  rum  to the area of Canada, in return Canada exported salted  cod  and  lumber  supplies to the  West Indies . This trade continued for a number of years, however these ties eventually weaned as the influence of the  Thirteen American colonies  grew in importance for Canada, Barbados, and the wider West Indies region.   In time, the various colonies of Canada entered into the agreement for  Confederation . The powerful Barbados Agricultural Society, (BAS) which was made up of influential Barbadian plantation owners put together a proposition for Barbados to take part in this confederation as well. The proposal was made to Sir  Francis Hincks , but the deal didn't proceed and Barbados' interest subsided. It was not until the 1950s when an agenda of political association with Canada was broached again by several Barbadian members of  parliament , just prior to the country negotiating its own independence from the  United Kingdom .   In 1907, the Government of Canada opened its  Trade Commissioner Service  to the Caribbean region [ 2 ] . This was located on the current grounds of the  Queen Elizabeth Hospital  in  Bridgetown, Barbados .   By the early 1900's several large Canadian financial institutions looked towards expansion into the West Indies. On February 16, 1911 the  Royal Bank of Canada  marked the opening of their first commercial branch in Barbados. [ 3 ]  then in 1920,  CIBC  did the same [ 4 ] , and finally  Scotiabank  followed the first two in 1956. [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Trade   Today, the relations between both nations has flourished in recent years. A growing legion of Canadian businesses and companies have established operations offering services in Barbados. Additionally several reports have shown Barbados to be one of the largest recipients of Canadian  Foreign Direct Investment  (FDI). The  Barbadian economy  on the other hand has witnessed Canada becoming its largest source of foreign investment. The governments of both nations continue to identify ways to cement good relations and to nurture economic growth between both countries.   During the Fifth Barbados Charity Ball held in Canada  David Thompson , the Prime Minister of Barbados and also it's Minister of Finance announced that Canadians represent some 75% of the international financial community in Barbados. [ 6 ]   The Canadian government has also played an extremely critical role in the continuation of the Barbados-based  Caribbean Development Bank  (CDB) since its inception and acts as a significant donor country to the institution.     [ edit ]   Politics   In 2007, Canada's  Prime Minister  Stephen Harper announced the desire to heighten Canada's profile in the  Americas . As part of his plan, Harper and his Canadian envoy visited several nations of  Latin America  and the  Caribbean  regions which included Barbados. Stephen Harper took part in several closed door meetings with the then Barbadian prime minister  Owen Arthur  and the other heads of the  Caribbean Community  (CARICOM) group of nations. [ 7 ]  Since Harper's visit, Canada and Barbados have concluded a mutual open skies agreement [ 8 ]  and are currently in the process of working on a bilateral  Free trade agreement  which will encompass Barbados and the rest of CARICOM.   In addition to the Prime Minister's visit to Barbados, the Canadian Governor-General  Michalle Jean  also visited Barbados that same year where she met personally with the Governor-General of Barbados. [ 9 ]   The overall relationship of Canada and Barbados are frequently overshadowed in media by the bilateral  double taxation  agreement between both nations.   In 2008, the three largest stock exchanges in the Caribbean ( Jamaica ,  Barbados , and  Trinidad and Tobago ) mulled the possibility that the Caribbean Stock Exchanges might seek to associate in some way with the  Toronto Stock Exchange . [ 10 ]  All three of these exchanges are currently seeking to join their three bourses into a more effective single Caribbean-wide unit known as the Caribbean Exchange Network (CXN) [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Migration   It is estimated that there are roughly 3,000-4,000 Canadian-born  permanent residents  living in Barbados and roughly the same number of Barbadian-born nationals living in Canada.     [ edit ]   Notable Canadians in Barbados     Eugene Melnyk  (Canadian Businessman) - Melenyk purchased a restaurant bar & grille establishment along the southern coast of Barbados from proprietor Bert Inniss. Melenyk then went on to continue marketing the bar as the Canadian Mecca of Barbados. Additionally, he is a financial stakeholder in the Barbados Sandy Lane Cup for  horseracing  and a major backer of Canadian community's sport of Road hockey usually played in supermarket or mall parking lots across Barbados.       Brett Callaghan (Canadian professional racing jockey) - Callaghan is the managing director of the website TotallyBarbados.com [ 12 ]  the website won the award as ""The Caribbean's Leading Overall Travel Information Website"" on December 14th, 2007 by the  World Travel Award .       [ edit ]   Notable Barbadians in Canada       Main article:  Canadians of Barbadian origin         Austin Clarke  - A renowned novelist for his literary work. Clark won the Giller Prize for The Polished Hoe in 2002, as well as the Commonwealth Writers Prize in 2003. Other works of his include, ""Growing Up Stupid Under the Union Jack"" a book about Barbados during the colonial years.       Anne Cools  - Cools a Conservative party member, became the first first person of afro-decent to be appointed Canadian Senate. Cools first entered into Canadian politics in 1978. She was appointed to the Senate in 1984.       Alan Emtage  - Emtage developed one of the first examples of a Internet search utility.       Keith Forde  - Forde is the first visible minority Deputy Chief of Police in the history of the  Toronto Police Service       Joe Fortes  - Joe Fortes was the first official lifeguard in the city of  Vancouver  at the turn of the twentieth century. He is most famous for his contribution to society.       George Lamming  - A novelist.       [ edit ]   Tourism   During the 1970's Canada became the largest source of tourists to Barbados. In 1979, roughly 97,000 Canadians visited the island of Barbados.  [ 13 ]  Over time Barbados has seen market share from Canada shift towards lower cost Caribbean destinations such as  Cuba  or the  Dominican Republic .   On Monday, November 3 2008  WestJet  commenced the airline's inaugural flight to Barbados. The main competitory of WestJet on this route is  Air Canada . [ 14 ]  The airline announced the start of a four-flights per week schedule going from  Toronto, Ontario  to Barbados. During the post-inaugural flight ceremony held at the executive lounge of the  Grantley Adams International Airport  the Barbadian Minister of Tourism Richard Sealy said that the Barbados Tourism Authority was currently seeking to increase its tourism from Canada. He also offered opportunity to collaborate in the future with WestJet should they need a regional Caribbean hub. According to the Barbados Advocate newspaper Sealy stated ""We are game if Westjet is interested, in becoming the regional hub for more of your business and we would certainly like to see not four flights a week, but eventually, if we can have a daily service. Grantley Adams is already an established hub and we can feed business into the other territories. So I think there are some possibilities for even greater levels of cooperation with Westjet"" he remarked to his Canadian counterparts.

Download our  Universal Gauge Chart  (PDF)   Read older  Cool Tools  articles...         Looking  for Bronze?   Two of our July projects call for bronze sheet in their materials lists. True  bronze (the kind from antiquity, with tin in the alloy) is not that easy to find  in small quantities of sheet, although casting grain is available. A reasonable  substitute is rich low brass, containing up to 20% zinc. Most suppliers refer  to any tin-bearing or golden color brass as bronze, and there are many alloy formulas,  so ask for details when purchasing. Cover artist Joanna Gollberg recommends Metalliferous  in New York City:  www.metalliferous.com   or 212-944-0909. They carry rich low brass alloy 230 (85% copper and 15% zinc)  in sheet and wire.     Find Jewelry Shows, or Submit Your Events to the  Jewelry Show Guide  ...

The South African coast stretches 2,798 kilometres (1,739 mi) [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  and borders both the  Atlantic  and  Indian   oceans . [ 7 ]  To the north of South Africa lie  Namibia ,  Botswana  and  Zimbabwe , to the east are  Mozambique  and  Swaziland , while the  Kingdom of Lesotho  is an independent  enclave  surrounded by South African territory. [ 8 ]   Modern human beings have inhabited South Africa for more than 100,000 years. [ 9 ]  A century and a half after the discovery of the  Cape Sea Route , the  Dutch East India Company   founded  a refreshment station at what would become  Cape Town  in 1652. [ 10 ]  Cape Town became a British colony in 1806. European settlement expanded during the 1820s as the  Boers  (original  Dutch ,  Flemish ,  German  and  French  settlers) and the British  1820 Settlers  claimed land in the north and east of the country. Conflicts arose among the Xhosa, Zulu and Afrikaner groups. However, the discovery of diamonds and later gold triggered the conflict known as the  Anglo-Boer War  as the Boers and the British fought for the control of the South African mineral wealth. Although the Boers were defeated, limited independence was given to South Africa in 1910 as a British dominion. Anti-British policies focused on ultimate independence which was achieved in 1961 when South Africa was declared a  republic . The leading  National Party  legislated for a continuation of racial segregation begun under Dutch and British colonial rule, Boer republics, and subsequent South African governments (and which in 1948 became legally institutionalised  segregation  known as  apartheid ), despite opposition both in and outside of the country. In 1990 the then president  F.W. de Klerk  began to dismantle this legislation, and in 1994 the first democratic election was held in South Africa. This election brought  Nelson Mandela  and the current ruling party, the  African National Congress  to power, and the country rejoined the  Commonwealth of Nations .   South Africa is known for its diversity in cultures, languages, and religious beliefs, and eleven official languages are recognised in its  constitution . [ 7 ]  English is the most commonly spoken language in official and commercial public life, however it is only the fifth most spoken home language. [ 7 ]  South Africa is ethnically diverse, with the largest  Caucasian ,  Indian , and  racially mixed  communities in Africa. Although 79.6% of the South African population is  Black , [ 2 ]  this category is neither culturally nor linguistically homogeneous, as people within this classification speak a number of different  Bantu languages , nine of which have official status. [ 7 ]  Midyear 2007, the South African population was estimated at 47.9 million.

(September 2008)       Main article:  History of South Africa   South Africa contains some of the oldest archaeological sites in the world. [ 11 ]   [ 12 ]  Extensive fossil remains at the  Sterkfontein ,  Kromdraai  and Makapansgat caves suggest that various  australopithecines  existed in South Africa from about three million years ago. [ 13 ]  These were succeeded by various species of  Homo , including  Homo habilis ,  Homo erectus  and modern humans,  Homo sapiens . Settlements of  Bantu -speaking peoples, who were  iron -using agriculturists and herdsmen, were already present south of the  Limpopo River  by the fourth or fifth century (see  Bantu expansion ) displacing and absorbing the original  KhoiSan  speakers. They slowly moved south and the earliest ironworks in modern-day  KwaZulu-Natal Province  are believed to date from around 1050. The southernmost group was the  Xhosa  people, whose language incorporates certain linguistic traits from the earlier KhoiSan people, reaching the  Fish River , in today's  Eastern Cape Province . These  Iron Age  populations displaced earlier people, who often had  hunter-gatherer  societies, as they migrated.     European colonisation          Painting of an account of the arrival of  Jan van Riebeeck , the first  European  to settle in South Africa, with  Devil's Peak  in the background       In 1487, the  Portuguese  explorer  Bartolomeu Dias  became the first European to reach the southernmost point of Africa. Initially named The Cape of Storms, The King of Portugal,  John II , renamed it the  Cabo da Boa Esperana  or  Cape of Good Hope  as it led to the riches of India. This great feat of navigation was later immortalised in  Cames ' epic Portuguese poem,  The Lusiads  (1572). In 1652, a refreshment station was established at the  Cape of Good Hope  by  Jan van Riebeeck  on behalf of the  Dutch East India Company .  Slaves  were brought from  Indonesia ,  Madagascar , and India as a labour source for the Dutch immigrants in  Cape Town . As they expanded east, the Dutch settlers eventually met the south-westerly expanding  Xhosa  people in the region of the  Fish River . A series of wars, called the  Cape Frontier Wars , ensued, mainly caused by conflicting land and livestock interests.   Great Britain  took over the  Cape of Good Hope  area in 1795 ostensibly to stop it falling into the hands of the Revolutionary French, but also seeking to use  Cape Town  in particular as a stop on the route to Australia and India. It was later returned to the Dutch in 1803, but soon afterwards the  Dutch East India Company  declared bankruptcy, and the British annexed the Cape Colony in 1806. The British continued the frontier wars against the Xhosa, pushing the eastern frontier eastward through a line of forts established along the Fish River and consolidating it by encouraging  British settlement . Due to pressure of  abolitionist  societies in Britain, the  British parliament  first stopped its global  slave trade  with the passage of the  Slave Trade Act 1807 , then abolished slavery in all its colonies with the  Slavery Abolition Act 1833 . During the 1830s, approximately 12 000  Boers  (later known as  Voortrekkers ), departed from the  Cape Colony , where they were subjected to British control, to the future Natal, Orange Free State and Transvaal regions. The Boers founded the  Boer Republics  - the  South African Republic  (Now  Gauteng ,  Limpopo ,  Mpumalanga  and  North West  provinces) and the  Orange Free State  ( Free State ).   The discovery of  diamonds  in 1867 and  gold  in 1884 in the interior encouraged economic growth and immigration, intensifying the subjugation of the indigenous people. These important economic resources did not only play a role between European and the indigenous population but also between the Boers and the British. [ 14 ]   The  Boer Republics  successfully resisted British encroachments during the  First Boer War  (18801881) using  guerrilla warfare  tactics, much better suited to local conditions. However, the British returned in greater numbers, more experience, and more suitable tactics in the  Second Boer War  (18991902). The Boers' attempt to ally themselves with  German South-West Africa  provided the British with yet another excuse to take control of the Boer Republics. [ citation needed ]           Boers  in combat (1881).         Independence   After four years of negotiating, the  Union of South Africa  was created from the  Cape  and  Natal  colonies, as well as the republics of  Orange Free State  and  Transvaal , on 31 May 1910, exactly eight years after the end of the Second Boer War. The newly created Union of South Africa was a  dominion . The  Natives' Land Act  of 1913 severely restricted the ownership of land by 'blacks', at that stage to a mere 7% of the country, although this amount was eventually increased marginally. [ 15 ]  The union was effectively granted independence from the United Kingdom with the passage of the  Statute of Westminster , which morphed the  British king's  position within South Africa into that of the distinct  King of South Africa . In 1934, the  South African Party  and  National Party  merged to form the  United Party , seeking reconciliation between Afrikaners and English-speaking ""Whites"", but split in 1939 over the entry of the Union into  World War II  as an ally of the United Kingdom, a move which the National Party strongly opposed.   In 1948, the  National Party  was elected to power, and intensified the implementation of racial segregation that had begun under Dutch and British colonial rule, and subsequent South African governments since the Union was formed. The Nationalist Government systematised existing segregationist laws, and the system of segregation became known collectively as  apartheid . Not surprisingly, this segregation also applied to the wealth acquired during rapid industrialisation of the 1950s, '60s, and '70s. While the White minority enjoyed the highest  standard of living  in all of Africa, often comparable to  First World  western nations, the Black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard, including income, education, housing, and life expectancy. On 31 May 1961, following a whites-only  referendum , the country became a  republic  and left the (British)  Commonwealth . The office of  Governor-General  was abolished and replaced with the position of  State President .   Apartheid became increasingly controversial, leading to widespread  sanctions ,  divestment  and growing unrest and oppression within South Africa. (See also the article on the  History of South Africa in the apartheid era .) A long period of harsh suppression by the government, and at times violent resistance,  strikes , marches, protests, and  sabotage  by bombing and other means, by various anti-apartheid movements, most notably the  African National Congress  (ANC), followed. In the late 1970s, South Africa began a programme of  nuclear weapons  development and in the following decade it produced six deliverable nuclear weapons. The rationale for the nuclear arsenal is disputed, but it is believed [ who? ]  that  Vorster  and  P.W. Botha  wanted to be able to catalyse American intervention in the event of a war between South Africa and the  Cuban -supported  MPLA  government of  Angola .     Democracy   In 1990 the  National Party  government took the first step towards negotiating itself out of power when it lifted the ban on the  African National Congress  and other  left-wing  political organisations, and released  Nelson Mandela  from prison after twenty-seven years' incarceration on a  sabotage  sentence. Apartheid legislation was gradually removed from the statute books, and South Africa also destroyed its nuclear arsenal and acceded to the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . The first  multi-racial elections  were held in 1994, which the ANC won by an overwhelming majority. It has been in power ever since.   In  post-apartheid South Africa , millions of South Africans, mostly black, continued to live in  poverty , though poverty among whites, previously rare, has increased greatly. [ 16 ]  While some have partly attributed this to the legacy of the apartheid system, increasingly many attribute it to the failure of the current government to tackle social issues, coupled with the monetary and fiscal discipline of the current government to ensure both redistribution of wealth and economic growth. Since the ANC-led government took power, the  United Nations   Human Development Index  of South Africa has fallen, while it was steadily rising until the mid-1990s. [ 17 ]  Some of this could possibly be attributed to the  AIDS   pandemic  and the failure of the government to take steps to address it, [ 18 ] some of it can also be pinpointed to a government policy of  redistribution of wealth . As a mitigating factor, the social housing policy of the current government has produced an improvement in living conditions.     Politics   Main articles:  Politics of South Africa ,  Government of South Africa , and  Law of South Africa          The  Union Buildings  in  Pretoria  is the home of the South African executive.       South Africa has three capital cities:  Cape Town , the largest of the three, is the  legislative  capital;  Pretoria  is the  administrative  capital; and  Bloemfontein  is the  judicial  capital. South Africa has a  bicameral   parliament : the  National Council of Provinces  (the  upper house ) has 90 members, while the  National Assembly  (the  lower house ) has 400 members. Members of the lower house are elected on a population basis by  proportional representation : half of the members are elected from national lists and the other half are elected from provincial lists. Ten members are elected to represent each province in the National Council of Provinces, regardless of the population of the province. Elections for both chambers are held every five years. The government is formed in the lower house, and the leader of the majority party in the National Assembly is the  President .   The primary sources of South Africa law are Roman-Dutch mercantile law and personal law with English Common law, as imports of Dutch settlements and  British colonialism . [ 19 ]  The first European based law in South Africa was brought by the  Dutch East India Company  and is called  Roman-Dutch law . It was imported before the  codification  of European law into the  Napoleonic Code  and is comparable in many ways to  Scots law . This was followed in the 19th century by  English law , both  common  and  statutory . Starting in 1910 with unification, South Africa had its own  parliament  which passed laws specific for South Africa, building on those previously passed for the individual member colonies.   Current South African politics are dominated by the  African National Congress  (ANC), which received 69.7% of the vote during the last  2004 general election  and 66.3% of the vote in the  2006 municipal election . The current  President of South Africa  is  Kgalema Motlanthe , who replaced  Thabo Mbeki  on 25 September 2008. Mbeki succeeded former President  Nelson Mandela  in 1999, and was re-elected for a second five year term in 2004, but announced his resignation on 20 September 2008.   The main challenger to the rule of the ANC is the  Democratic Alliance  party, which received 12.4% of the vote in the 2004 election and 14.8% in the 2006 election.  Helen Zille , (elected 6 May 2007), is the party leader; the previous leader was  Tony Leon . The formerly dominant  New National Party , which introduced apartheid through its predecessor, the  National Party , chose to merge with the ANC on 9 April 2005. Other major political parties represented in Parliament are the  Inkatha Freedom Party , which mainly represents  Zulu  voters, and the  Independent Democrats , who took 6.97% and 1.7% of the vote respectively, in the 2004 election.   Since 2004, the country has had many thousands of popular protests, some violent, making it, according to one academic, the ""most protest-rich country in the world"". [ 20 ]  Many of these protests have been organised from the growing  shanty towns  that surround South African cities.     Foreign relations and military   Main articles:  South African National Defence Force ,  Foreign relations of South Africa , and  South Africa and weapons of mass destruction   Since the end of apartheid, the South African foreign policy has focused on its African partners particularly in the  Southern African Development Community  (SADC) and the  African Union . South Africa has played a key role as a mediator in African conflicts over the last decade, such as in  Burundi , the  Democratic Republic of Congo , the  Comoros , and  Zimbabwe . After apartheid ended, South Africa was readmitted to the  Commonwealth of Nations . As the  Union of South Africa , South Africa was a founding member of the  United Nations  and the then Prime Minister  Jan Smuts  wrote the preamble to its constitution. South Africa is currently a non-permanent member of the  United Nations Security Council  and has attracted controversy by voting against a resolution criticising the  Burmese  government in 2006 and against the implementation of sanctions against  Zimbabwe  in 2008. South Africa is a member of the  Group of 77  and chaired the organisation in 2006. South Africa is a member of the  South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone ,  Southern African Customs Union ,  World Trade Organization ,  International Monetary Fund ,  G20  and  G8+5 .   The South African  armed forces , known as the  South African National Defence Force  (SANDF), was created in 1994. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  Previously known as the  South African Defence Force  (SADF), the new force is an all volunteer army and consists of the forces of the old SADF, as well as the forces of the African nationalist groups, namely  Umkhonto we Sizwe  (MK),  Azanian People's Liberation Army  (APLA), and the former  Bantustan  defence forces. [ 21 ]  The SANDF is subdivided into four branches, the  South African Army , the  South African Air Force , the  South African Navy , and the  South African Military Health Services . [ 23 ]   In recent years, the SANDF has become a major  peacekeeping  force in Africa, [ 24 ]  and has been involved in operations in  Lesotho , the  Democratic Republic of the Congo , [ 24 ]  and  Burundi , [ 24 ]  amongst others. It has also participated as a part of multi-national  UN  peacekeeping forces.   South Africa undertook a nuclear weapons programme in the 1970s [ 25 ]  and  may have conducted  a nuclear test over the  Atlantic  in 1979. [ 26 ]  It is the only African country to have successfully  developed nuclear weapons . It has become the first country (followed by Ukraine) with nuclear capability to voluntarily renounce and dismantle its programme and in the process signed the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty  in 1991. [ 25 ]     Provinces, districts and municipalities   Main articles:  Provinces of South Africa ,  Districts of South Africa , and  Municipalities of South Africa          Map showing the provinces and districts (numbered) of South Africa.             Northern Cape          North West          Gauteng          Limpopo          Mpumalanga            KwaZulu-Natal          Eastern Cape          Free State          Western Cape               When apartheid ended in 1994, the South African government had to integrate the formerly independent and semi-independent  Bantustans  into the political structure of South Africa. To this end, it abolished the four former provinces of South Africa ( Cape Province ,  Natal ,  Orange Free State , and  Transvaal ) and replaced them with nine fully integrated provinces. The new provinces are usually much smaller than the former provinces, which theoretically gives local governments more resources to distribute over smaller areas.   The nine provinces are further subdivided into  52 districts :  6 metropolitan  and  46 district municipalities . The 46 district municipalities are further subdivided into  231 local municipalities . The district municipalities also contain 20 district management areas (mostly game parks) that are directly governed by the district municipalities. The six metropolitan municipalities perform the functions of both district and local municipalities.

At 470,979  sq mi  (1,219,912 km), [ 27 ]  South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world (after  Mali ). It is comparable in size to  Colombia .  Njesuthi  in the  Drakensberg  at 3,408 m (11,424 ft) is the highest peak in South Africa.          View of the  Drakensberg mountains , the highest mountain range in South Africa.       South Africa has a generally  temperate climate , due in part to it being surrounded by the  Atlantic  and  Indian Oceans  on three sides, by its location in the climatically milder  southern hemisphere  and due to the average elevation rising steadily towards the north (towards the  equator ) and further inland. Due to this varied topography and oceanic influence, a great variety of climatic zones exist.   The climatic zones vary, from the extreme  desert  of the southern  Namib  in the farthest northwest to the lush  subtropical  climate in the east along the  Mozambique  border and the  Indian  ocean. From the east, the land quickly rises over a  mountainous   escarpment  towards the interior  plateau  known as the  Highveld . Even though South Africa is classified as  semi-arid , there is considerable variation in  climate  as well as  topography .   The interior of South Africa is a vast, rather flat, and sparsely populated  scrubland ,  Karoo , which is drier towards the northwest along the Namib desert. In contrast, the eastern coastline is lush and well-watered, which produces a climate similar to the tropics. The extreme southwest has a climate remarkably similar to that of the  Mediterranean  with wet winters and hot, dry summers, hosting the famous  Fynbos   Biome . This area also produces much of the  wine  in South Africa. This region is also particularly known for its wind, which blows intermittently almost all year. The severity of this wind made passing around the  Cape of Good Hope  particularly treacherous for sailors, causing many  shipwrecks . Further east on the south coast, rainfall is distributed more evenly throughout the year, producing a green landscape. This area is popularly known as the  Garden Route .          Satellite picture of South Africa       The  Free State  is particularly flat due to the fact that it lies centrally on the high plateau. North of the  Vaal River , the Highveld becomes better watered and does not experience subtropical extremes of heat.  Johannesburg , in the centre of the Highveld, is at 1,740 metres (5,709 ft) and receives an annual rainfall of 760 millimetres (30  in ). Winters in this region are cold, although  snow  is rare.   To the north of Johannesburg, the altitude drops beyond the escarpment of the Highveld, and turns into the lower lying Bushveld, an area of mixed dry forest and an abundance of wildlife. East of the Highveld, beyond the eastern escarpment, the Lowveld stretches towards the  Indian  ocean. It has particularly high temperatures, and is also the location of extended subtropical agriculture.   The high  Drakensberg mountains , which form the south-eastern escarpment of the Highveld, offer limited  skiing  opportunities in winter. The coldest place in South Africa is  Sutherland  in the western  Roggeveld Mountains , where midwinter temperatures can reach as low as 15 degrees  Celsius  (5  F ). The deep interior has the hottest temperatures: A temperature of 51.7 C (125 F) was recorded in 1948 in the  Northern Cape  Kalahari near  Upington . [ 28 ]   South Africa also has one possession, the small sub-Antarctic archipelago of the  Prince Edward Islands , consisting of  Marion Island  (290 km/112 sq mi) and Prince Edward Island (45 km/17.3 sq mi) (not to be confused with the  Canadian province of the same name ).           Weather averages for Cape Town, South Africa         Month   Jan   Feb   Mar   Apr   May   Jun   Jul   Aug   Sep   Oct   Nov   Dec   Year       Average high C (F)   27  (81)   28  (82)   26  (79)   24  (75)   20  (68)   18  (64)   17  (63)   18  (64)   19  (66)   22  (72)   24  (75)   26  (79)   28  (82)       Average low C (F)   16  (61)   16  (61)   15  (59)   13  (55)   10  (50)   8  (46)   8  (46)   8  (46)   9  (48)   11  (52)   14  (57)   15  (59)   8  (46)       Precipitation  mm (inches)   16.5  (0.65)   13  (0.51)   20  (0.79)   54  (2.13)   92  (3.62)   111  (4.37)   96  (3.78)   87  (3.43)   56  (2.2)   40  (1.57)   24  (0.94)   18  (0.71)   627  (24.69)       Source: EuroWEATHER [ 29 ]  2008-02-22         Flora and fauna   See also:  Wildlife of South Africa   See also:  Protected areas of South Africa           Fynbos , a  floral kingdom  unique to South Africa, is found near  Cape Town               Swartberg  mountains near the town of  Oudtshoorn              A field of flowers in Weskus National Park.       South Africa is one of only 17 countries worldwide considered  megadiverse . It has more than 20,000 different  plants , or about 10% of all the known  species  of plants on  Earth , making it particularly rich in plant biodiversity. South Africa is the 6th most biodiverse country, [ 30 ]  after  Brazil ,  Colombia ,  Indonesia ,  China , and  Mexico . The most prevalent biome in South Africa is the  grassland , particularly on the  Highveld , where the plant cover is dominated by different  grasses , low  shrubs , and  acacia trees , mainly camel-thorn and whitethorn.  Vegetation  becomes even more sparse towards the northwest due to low  rainfall . There are several species of water-storing  succulents  like  aloes  and euphorbias in the very hot and dry  Namaqualand  area. The grass and thorn  savannah  turns slowly into a bush savannah towards the north-east of the country, with denser growth. There are significant numbers of  baobab  trees in this area, near the northern end of  Kruger National Park . [ 31 ]   The  Fynbos   Biome , which makes up the majority of the area and plant life in the  Cape floristic region , one of the six  floral kingdoms , is located in a small region of the  Western Cape  and contains more than 9,000 of those species, making it among the richest regions on earth in terms of floral biodiversity. The majority of the plants are  evergreen  hard-leaf plants with fine, needle-like  leaves , such as the  sclerophyllous  plants. Another uniquely South African plant is the  protea  genus of flowering plants. There are around 130 different species of protea in South Africa.   While South Africa has a great wealth of flowering plants, it has few  forests . Only 1% of South Africa is forest, almost exclusively in the  humid   coastal plain  along the  Indian Ocean  in  KwaZulu-Natal  (see  KwaZulu-Cape coastal forest mosaic ). There are even smaller reserves of forests that are out of the reach of  fire , known as montane forests (see  Knysna-Amatole montane forests ).  Plantations  of imported tree species are predominant, particularly the non-native  eucalyptus  and  pine . South Africa has lost a large area of natural habitat in the last four decades, primarily due to  overpopulation , sprawling development patterns and  deforestation  during the nineteenth century. South Africa is one of the worst affected countries in the world when it comes to invasion by alien species with many (e.g.  Black Wattle ,  Port Jackson ,  Hakea ,  Lantana  and  Jacaranda ) posing a significant threat to the native  biodiversity  and the already scarce water resources. The original  temperate forest  that met the first European settlers to South Africa was exploited ruthlessly until only small patches remained. Currently, South African  hardwood  trees like  Real Yellowwood   (Podocarpus latifolius) ,  stinkwood   (Ocotea bullata) , and South African  Black Ironwood   (Olea laurifolia)  are under government protection.   Numerous  mammals  are found in the  bushveld  habitats including  lions ,  leopards ,  white rhinos ,  blue wildebeest ,  kudus ,  impalas ,  hyenas ,  hippopotamus  and  giraffes . A significant extent of the bushveld habitat exists in the north-east including  Kruger National Park  and the  Mala Mala  Reserve, as well as in the far north in the  Waterberg Biosphere .   Climate change is expected to bring considerable warming and drying to much of this already semi-arid region, with greater frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, flooding and drought. According to computer generated climate modelling produced by the South African National Biodiversity Institute [ 32 ]  parts of southern Africa will see an increase in temperature by about one degree Celsius along the coast to more than four degrees Celsius in the already hot hinterland such as the  Northern Cape  in late spring and summertime by 2050.   The Cape Floral Kingdom has been identified as one of the global  biodiversity hotspots  since it will be hit very hard by  climate change  and has such a great diversity of life. Drought, increased intensity and frequency of fire and climbing temperatures are expected to push many of these  rare species  towards  extinction .   South Africa houses many endemic species, among them the  critically endangered   Riverine Rabbit  ( Bunolagus monticullaris ) in the  Karoo .     Economy   Main article:  Economy of South Africa          The  Victoria & Alfred Waterfront  in  Cape Town  with  Table Mountain  in the background. Cape Town has become an important  retail  and  tourism  centre for the country, and attracts the largest number of foreign visitors in South Africa       By  UN  classification South Africa is a middle-income country with an abundant supply of resources, well-developed financial, legal, communications, energy, and transport sectors, a  stock exchange  (the  JSE Limited ), that ranks among the top twenty in the world, and a modern infrastructure supporting an efficient distribution of goods to major urban centres throughout the entire region. South Africa is ranked 25th in the world in terms of  GDP  (PPP) as of 2007.   Advanced development is significantly localised around four areas: Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Durban, and Pretoria/Johannesburg. Beyond these four economic centres, development is marginal and poverty is still prevalent despite government efforts. Consequently the vast majority of South Africans are poor. However, key marginal areas have experienced rapid growth recently. Such areas include Mossel Bay to Plettenberg Bay; Rustenburg area; Nelspruit area; Bloemfontein; Cape West Coast; and the KwaZulu-Natal North Coast.   Even though South Africa has the seventh highest per capita income in Africa, only behind  Libya ,  Mauritius  it suffers from large income gaps and a  dual economy  marking it as a  developing country . South Africa has one of the highest rates of  income inequality  in the world. A decade of continual economic growth has helped to lower unemployment, but daunting economic and social problems remain. The average South African household income decreased considerably between 1995 and 2000. As for racial inequality,  Statistics South Africa  reported that in 1995 the average white household earned four times as much as the average black household. In 2000 the average white household was earning six times more than the average black household. [ 33 ]  The  affirmative action  policies have seen a rise in black economic wealth and an emerging black middle class. [ 34 ]  Other problems are crime, corruption, and  HIV / AIDS .   At the start of 2000, then President Thabo Mbeki vowed to promote economic growth and foreign investment by relaxing restrictive labour laws, stepping up the pace of  privatisation , and cutting unneeded governmental spending. His policies face strong opposition from organised  labour . South Africa is also the largest energy producer and consumer on the continent. South Africa is a popular tourist destination, and a substantial amount of revenue comes from tourism. [ 35 ]  Among the main attractions are the diverse and picturesque culture, the game reserves and the highly regarded local wines.   The South African  rand  (ZAR), is the most actively traded emerging  market currency  in the world. It has joined an elite club of fifteen currencies, the  Continuous linked settlement  (CLS), where forex transactions are settled immediately, lowering the risks of transacting across  time zones . The rand was the best-performing currency against the  United States dollar  (USD) between 2002 and 2005, according to the  Bloomberg  Currency Scorecard.   The volatility of the  rand  has affected economic activity, falling sharply during 2001 and hitting a historic low of 13.85  ZAR  to the  USD , raising fears of inflation, and causing the Reserve Bank to increase  interest rates . The rand has since recovered, trading at 7.13 ZAR to the dollar as of January 2008. However, as exporters are put under considerable pressure from a stronger domestic currency, many call for government intervention to help soften the rand.   Refugees from poorer neighbouring countries include many immigrants from the DRC, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Malawi and others, representing a large portion of the informal sector. With high unemployment levels amongst poorer South Africans,  xenophobia  is prevalent and many people born in South Africa feel resentful of immigrants who are seen to be depriving the native population of jobs, a feeling which has been given credibility by the fact that many South African employers have employed migrants from other countries for lower pay than South African citizens, especially in the  construction ,  tourism ,  agriculture  and  domestic service  industries. Illegal immigrants are also heavily involved in informal trading. [ 36 ]  However, many immigrants to South Africa continue to live in poor conditions, and the South African immigration policy has become increasingly restrictive since 1994. [ 37 ]   Principal international trading partners of South Africa  besides other African countries  include  Germany , the  United States ,  China ,  Japan , the  United Kingdom  and  Spain .  [ 38 ]  Chief exports include  corn ,  diamonds ,  fruits ,  gold ,  metals  and  minerals ,  sugar , and  wool .  Machinery  and transportation equipment make up more than one-third of the value of the countrys imports. Other imports include  chemicals , manufactured goods, and  petroleum .     Electricity crisis   After unsuccessful attempts by the government to encourage private construction of electricity generation capacity, in 2007 the state-owned electricity supplier ( Eskom ) started experiencing a lack of capacity in the electrical generating and reticulation infrastructure. This led to an inability to meet the routine demands of industry and consumers, resulting in countrywide  rolling blackouts . Initially the lack of capacity was triggered by a failure at  Koeberg nuclear power station , but since then a general lack of capacity became evident. The supplier has been widely criticised for failing to adequately plan for and construct sufficient electrical generating capacity, [ 39 ]  although ultimately the government has admitted that it is at fault for refusing to approve funding for investment in infrastructure. [ 40 ]     Agriculture          Workers planting on a farm in the central area of  Mpumalanga .               Farm  workers.       South Africa has a large agricultural sector and is a net exporter of  farming  products. There are almost a thousand  agricultural cooperatives  and  agribusinesses  throughout the country, and agricultural exports have constituted 8% of South African total exports for the past five years. The agricultural industry contributes around 10% of formal employment, relatively low compared to other parts of Africa, as well as providing work for casual labourers and contributing around 2.6% of  GDP  for the nation. [ 41 ]  However, due to the  aridity  of the land, only 13.5% can be used for crop production, and only 3% is considered high potential land. [ 42 ]   Although the commercial farming sector is relatively well developed, people in some rural areas still survive on  subsistence agriculture . It is the eighth largest wine producer in the world, and the eleventh largest producer of sunflower seed. South Africa is a net exporter of agricultural products and foodstuffs, the largest number of exported items being  sugar ,  grapes ,  citrus ,  nectarines ,  wine  and  deciduous  fruit. The largest locally produced crop is  maize  (corn), and it has been estimated that 9 million tons are produced every year, with 7.4 million tons being consumed.  Livestock  are also popular on South African farms, with the country producing 85% of all meat consumed. The dairy industry consists of around 4,300 milk producers providing employment for 60,000 farm workers and contributing to the livelihoods of around 40,000 others. [ 43 ]   In recent years, the agricultural sector has introduced several reforms, some of which are controversial, such as  land reform  and the deregulation of the market for agricultural products. Land reform has been criticised both by farmers' groups and by landless workers, the latter alleging that the pace of change has not been fast enough, and the former alleging racist treatment and expressing concerns that a similar situation to  Zimbabwe's land reform policy  may develop, [ 44 ]  a fear exacerbated by comments made by  deputy president , the deputy president of South Africa. [ 45 ] [ 46 ]  The sector continues to face problems, with increased foreign competition and crime being two of the major challenges for the industry. The government has been accused of either putting in too much effort [ 47 ] , or not enough effort [ 48 ] , to tackle the problem of  farm attacks  as opposed to other forms of violent crime.   Another issue which affects South African agriculture is environmental damage caused by misuse of the land and global climate change. South Africa is unusually vulnerable to climate change and resultant diminution of surface waters. Some predictions show surface water supply could decrease by 60% by the year 2070 in parts of the Western Cape. [ 49 ]  To reverse the damage caused by land mismanagement, the government has supported a scheme which promotes  sustainable development  and the use of natural resources. [ 50 ]  Maize production, which contributes to a 36% majority of the gross value of South Africas field crops, has also experienced negative effects due to climate change. The estimated value of loss, which takes into consideration scenarios with and without the carbon dioxide fertilisation effect  [2]  ,ranges between 10s to 100s of millions of Rands.

Statistics South Africa  provided five  racial  categories by which people could classify themselves, the last of which, ""unspecified/other"" drew negligible responses, and these results were omitted. [ 52 ]  The 2006 midyear estimated figures for the other categories were  Black African  at 79.5%,  White  at 9.2%,  Coloured  at 8.9%, and  Indian or Asian  at 2.5%. [ 53 ]  Even though the population of South Africa has increased in the past decade [ 52 ] [ 54 ]  (primarily due to immigration), the country had an annual population growth rate of 0.501% in 2008 (CIA est.), including immigration. [ 55 ]  South Africa is home to an estimated 5 million  illegal immigrants , including some 3 million  Zimbabweans . [ 56 ] [ 57 ] [ 58 ]  A series of  anti-immigrant riots  occurred in South Africa beginning on 11 May 2008. [ 59 ] [ 60 ]   By far the major part of the population classified itself as African or black, but it is not culturally or linguistically homogeneous. Major ethnic groups include the  Zulu ,  Xhosa ,  Basotho  (South Sotho),  Bapedi  (North Sotho),  Venda ,  Tswana ,  Tsonga ,  Swazi  and  Ndebele , all of which speak  Bantu languages  (see  Bantu peoples of South Africa ).   Some, such as the Zulu, Xhosa, Bapedi and Venda groups, are unique to South Africa. Other groups are distributed across the borders with neighbours of South Africa: The  Basotho  group is also the major ethnic group in  Lesotho . The  Tswana  ethnic group constitute the majority of the population of  Botswana . The  Swazi  ethnic group is the major ethnic group in  Swaziland . The  Ndebele  ethnic group is also found in  Matabeleland  in  Zimbabwe , where they are known as the  Matabele . These Ndebele people are the descendants of a Zulu faction under the warrior  Mzilikazi  that escaped persecution from  Shaka  by migrating to their current territory. The  Tsonga  ethnic group is also found in southern  Mozambique , where they are known as the Shangaan.   The white population is not ethnically homogeneous and descend from many ethnic groups:  Dutch ,  Flemish ,  Portuguese , German, French  Huguenot , English, Irish, Italian, Scottish and  Welsh . Culturally and linguistically, they are divided into the  Afrikaners , who speak  Afrikaans , and English-speaking groups, many of whom are descended from British and Irish immigrants (see  Anglo-African ). Many small communities that have immigrated over the last century retain the use of other languages. The  white population  is on the decrease due to a low birth rate and emigration; as a factor in their decision to emigrate, many cite the high  crime  rate and the  affirmative action  policies of the government. Since 1994, approximately 1 000 000 white South Africans have permanently emigrated. [ 61 ] [ 62 ] [ 63 ] [ 64 ]  Despite high emigration levels, a high level of non-South African white immigrants have settled in the country, in particular from countries such as  Britain  and  Zimbabwe . For example, by 2005, an estimated 212 000 British citizens were residing in South Africa. Since 2003, the numbers of British migrants coming to South Africa has risen by 50%. An estimated 20 000 British migrants moved to South Africa in 2007. There have also been a significant number of  white Zimbabwean  arrivals, fleeing their home country in light of the economic and political problems currently facing the country. As well as recent arrivals, a significant number of white Zimbabweans emigrated to South Africa in the wake of independence in Zimbabwe in 1980. Some of the more nostalgic members of the community are known in popular culture as "" Whenwes "", because of their nostalgia for their lives in  Rhodesia  ""when we were in Rhodesia"". [ 65 ]   The term  Coloured  is still largely used for the people of mixed race descended from slaves brought in from East and Central Africa, the indigenous  Khoisan  who lived in the  Cape  at the time, Bantus, Whites (mostly the  Dutch / Afrikaner  and British settlers) as well as an admixture of  Javanese ,  Malay , Indian,  Malagasy  and Asian blood (such as  Burmese ). The majority speak Afrikaans. Khoisan is a term used to describe two separate groups, physically similar: light-skinned and small in stature. The  Khoikhoi , who were called  Hottentots  by the Europeans, were pastoralists and were annihilated; the San, called  Bushmen  by the Europeans, were hunter-gatherers. Within the Coloured community, more recent immigrants will also be found: Coloureds from the former  Rhodesia  (now  Zimbabwe );  Namibia  and immigrants of mixed descent from India and  Burma  ( Anglo-Indians / Anglo-Burmese ) who were welcomed to the Cape when India and Burma received their Independence.   The major part of the South African  Asian  population is Indian in origin (see  Indian South Africans ); many of them descended from indentured workers brought in the nineteenth century to work on the  sugar   plantations  of the eastern coastal area then known as  Natal . There is also a significant group of  Chinese South Africans  (approximately 100,000 individuals) and  Vietnamese  South Africans (approximately 50,000 individuals). In 2008, the Pretoria High Court has ruled that Chinese South Africans who arrived before 1994 are to be reclassified as  Coloureds . As a result of this ruling, about 12,000 - 15,000  [ 66 ] ethnically Chinese citizens who arrived before 1994, numbering 3%-5% of the total Chinese population in the country, will be able to benefit from government  BEE  policies. [ 67 ]   South Africa hosts a sizeable refugee and asylum seeker population. According to the  World Refugee Survey 2008 , published by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, this population numbered approximately 144,700 in 2007. [ 68 ]  Groups of refugees and asylum seekers numbering over 10,000 included people from  Zimbabwe  (48,400), The  Democratic Republic of the Congo  (24,800), and  Somalia  (12,900). [ 68 ]  These populations mainly lived in Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban, Cape Town, and Port Elizabeth. [ 68 ]     Science and technology   Several important scientific and technological developments have originated in South Africa.  The first human to human heart transplant was performed by cardiac surgeon  Christiaan Barnard  at  Groote Schuur Hospital  in December 1967  .  Max Theiler  developed a vaccine against Yellow Fever,  Allan McLeod Cormack  pioneered x-ray  Computed tomography , and  Aaron Klug  developed crystallographic electron microscopy techniques. These advancements were all recognised with  Nobel Prizes .  Sydney Brenner  won most recently, in 2002, for his pioneering work in  molecular biology .   Mark Shuttleworth  founded an early Internet security company  Thawte , that was subsequently bought out by world-leader  VeriSign . Despite government efforts to encourage entrepreneurship in biotechnology, IT and other high technology fields, no other notable groundbreaking companies have been founded in South Africa. However, it is the expressed objective of the government to transition the economy to be more reliant on high technology, based on the realisation that South African cannot compete with Far Eastern economies in manufacturing, nor can the republic rely on its mineral wealth in perpetuity.   South Africa has cultivated a burgeoning astronomy community. It hosts the  Southern African Large Telescope , the largest optical telescope in the southern hemisphere. South Africa is currently building the  Karoo Array Telescope  as a pathfinder for the $20 billion  Square Kilometer Array  project. South Africa is a finalist, with Australia, to be the host of the SKA.     Society and culture   Main article:  Culture of South Africa          Decorated houses,  Drakensberg Mountains              Traditional  South African cuisine .       It may be argued that there is no ""single"" culture in South Africa because of its ethnic diversity. Today, the diversity in foods from many cultures is enjoyed by all and especially marketed to tourists who wish to sample the large variety of South African cuisine. In addition to  food ,  music  and  dance  feature prominently.   South African cuisine  is heavily  meat-based  and has spawned the distinctively South African social gathering known as a  braai , or barbecue. South Africa has also developed into a major  wine  producer, with some of the best  vineyards  lying in valleys around  Stellenbosch ,  Franschoek ,  Paarl  and  Barrydale . [ 69 ]   There is great diversity in music from South Africa. Many black musicians who sang in Afrikaans or English during apartheid have since begun to sing in traditional African languages, and have developed a unique style called  Kwaito . Of note is  Brenda Fassie , who launched to fame with her song ""Weekend Special"", which was sung in English. More famous traditional musicians include  Ladysmith Black Mambazo , while the  Soweto String Quartet  performs classic music with an African flavour. White and Coloured South African singers are historically influenced by European musical styles including such western metal bands such as  Seether  (formerly Saron Gas). South Africa has produced world-famous jazz musicians, notably  Hugh Masekela ,  Jonas Gwangwa ,  Abdullah Ibrahim ,  Miriam Makeba ,  Jonathan Butler ,  Chris McGregor , and  Sathima Bea Benjamin .  Afrikaans  music covers multiple genres, such as the  contemporary   Steve Hofmeyr  and the  punk rock  band  Fokofpolisiekar . Crossover artists such as  Johnny Clegg  and his bands  Juluka  and  Savuka  have enjoyed various success underground, publicly, and abroad.   The South African black majority still has a substantial number of rural inhabitants who lead largely impoverished lives. It is among these people, however, that cultural traditions survive most strongly; as blacks have become increasingly  urbanised  and  westernised , aspects of traditional culture have declined. Urban blacks usually speak English or  Afrikaans  in addition to their native tongue. There are smaller but still significant groups of speakers of  Khoisan languages  who are not included in the eleven official languages, but are one of the eight other officially recognised languages. There are small groups of speakers of  endangered languages , most of which are from the Khoi-San family, that receive no official status; however, some groups within South Africa are attempting to promote their use and revival.   The  middle class  lifestyle, predominantly of the white minority but with growing numbers of Black, Coloured and Indian people, [ 70 ]  is similar in many respects to that of people found in  Western Europe , North America and  Australasia . Members of the middle class often study and work abroad for greater exposure to the markets of the world.   Asians , predominantly of Indian origin, preserve their own cultural heritage, languages and religious beliefs, being either  Christian ,  Hindu  or  Sunni Muslim  and speaking English, with Indian languages like  Hindi ,  Telugu ,  Tamil  or  Gujarati  being spoken less frequently, but the majority of Indians being able to understand their mother tongue. The first Indians arrived on the famous  Truro ship  as  indentured labourers  in Natal to work the Sugar Cane Fields. There is a much smaller  Chinese  community in South Africa, although its numbers have increased due to immigration from  Republic of China  (Taiwan).   South Africa has also had a large influence in the  Scouting  movement, with many Scouting traditions and ceremonies coming from the experiences of  Robert Baden-Powell  (the founder of Scouting) during his time in South Africa as a military officer in the 1890s. The  South African Scout Association  was one of the first youth organisations to open its doors to youth and adults of all races in South Africa. This happened on 2 July 1977 at a conference known as  Quo Vadis . [ 71 ]   The South African music scene consists of  Kwaito , a new music genre that had developed in the mid 80s and has since developed to become the most popular social economical form of representation among the populous. Though some may argue that the political aspects of Kwaito has since diminished after  Apartheid , and the relative interest in politics has become a minor aspect of daily life. Some argue that in a sense,  Kwaito  is in fact a political force that shows activism in its apolitical actions. Today, major corporations like  Sony ,  BMG , and  EMI  have appeared on the South African scene to produce and distribute  Kwaito  music. Due to its overwhelming popularity, as well as the general influence of DJs, who are among the top 5 most influential types of people within the country,  Kwaito  has taken over radio, television, and magazines. [ 72 ]   Kwaito , much like most hip-hop has its own local flavor and originality. However, unlike when hip-hop first burst on the scene as a politically driven and rebellious underground movement, South Africans wanted to create a happier vibe. As the post-apartheid fog cleared, South African youth found their ""own voice in a style of music known as kwaito, spawning a new (and profitable) industry"". [ 73 ]  According to TIMEeurope magazine, ""The kwaito sound now regularly incorporates traditional African music, jazz, gospel, and even rock guitar, most notably on Mandoza's 2000 hit Nkalakatha, one of the few kwaito records to cross over onto traditionally white radio"". [ 74 ]  In the kwaito, the samples from old school  Jamaican dancehall , European house, etc.,  tempos  are changed, beats are added, and urban street slang is also incorporated. This local flavour of music more recently has been attacked for its lack of ingenuity and its betrayal of its roots. The melodies and the incorporation of sex and dance have since become very similar to the American standard. In addition Kwaito has been criticised for its absence of influential lyrical content. As Kwaito is still a developing genre, and since the South African population is only around 48 million, sales of only 25,000 CDs are required for ""gold"" certification in South Africa. [ 73 ]     Religion   Main article:  Religion in South Africa           St. Mark 's Anglican Cathedral.       According to the latest 2001 national census, Christians accounted for 79.7% of the population. This includes  Zion Christian  11.1%,  Pentecostal  ( Charismatic ) 8.2%,  Roman Catholic  7.1%,  Methodist  6.8%,  Dutch Reformed  6.7%,  Anglican  3.8%, and other Christian 36%.  Islam  accounted for 1.5% of the population,  Hinduism  about 1.3%, and  Judaism  0.2%. 15.1% had no religious affiliation, 2.3% were other and 1.4% were unspecified. [ 75 ] [ 76 ]   African Indigenous Churches were the largest of the  Christian  groups. It was believed that many of these persons who claimed no affiliation with any organised religion adhered to  traditional indigenous religions . Many peoples have  syncretic  religious practices combining Christian and indigenous influences. [ 77 ]   Islam in South Africa  itself is not known to pre-date the colonial period, despite the isolated contact neighbouring  Mozambique  had with  Arab  and  East African  traders. [ citation needed ]  There is no evidence that Islam was known to the  Zulu ,  Swazi , or  Xhosa  of the east coast prior to the colonial era. Many South African Muslims are described as  Coloureds , notably in the  Western Cape , especially those whose ancestors came as slaves from the Indonesian archipelago (the  Cape Malays ). Others are described as  Indians , notably in  KwaZulu-Natal , including those whose ancestors came as traders from  South Asia ; they have been joined by others from other parts of Africa as well as white or black South African converts. It is estimated that  Islam  is the fastest growing religion of conversion in the country, [ 78 ]  with the number of black  Muslims  growing sixfold, from 12,000 in 1991 to 74,700 in 2004. [ 79 ]   Hinduism  dates back to British Colonial period primarily but later waves of continuous immigrants from India have contributed to a sizeable Hindu population. Most Hindus are ethnically South Asian but there are many who come from mixed racial stock and many are converts with the efforts of Hindu missionaries such as ISKCON. Other religions in smaller numbers are  Sikhism ,  Jainism  and  Bah' Faith . [ 76 ]     Languages   Main article:  Languages of South Africa          Map showing principal South African languages by municipality. Lighter shades indicate a non-majority  plurality .             Afrikaans          Northern Sotho          Southern Sotho          Swati          Tsonga            Tswana          Venda          Xhosa          Zulu               South Africa has eleven  official languages : [ 80 ]   Sepedi ,  Sesotho ,  Setswana ,  siSwati ,  Tshivenda ,  Xitsonga ,  Afrikaans ,  English ,  isiNdebele ,  isiXhosa  and  isiZulu . In this regard it is  second only to India  in number. While each language is formally equal to every other, some languages are spoken more than others. According to the 2001 National Census, the three most spoken first home languages are Zulu (23.8%), Xhosa (17.6%) and Afrikaans (13.3%). [ 52 ]  Despite the fact that English is recognised as the language of commerce and science, it was spoken by only 8.2% of South Africans at home in 2001, an even lower percentage than in 1996 (8.6%). [ 52 ]   There are  eleven official names  for South Africa, one in each of the official national languages. The country also recognises eight non-official languages:  Fanagalo ,  Khoe ,  Lobedu ,  Nama ,  Northern Ndebele ,  Phuthi ,  San  and  South African Sign Language . [ citation needed ]  These non-official languages may be used in certain official uses in limited areas where it has been determined that these languages are prevalent. Nevertheless, their populations are not such that they require nationwide recognition.   Many of the ""unofficial languages"" of the  San  and  Khoikhoi  people contain regional  dialects  stretching northward into Namibia and Botswana, and elsewhere. These people, who are a physically distinct population from other Africans, have their own cultural identity based on their  hunter-gatherer  societies. They have been marginalised to a great extent, and many of their languages are in danger of becoming  extinct .   Many white South Africans also speak other European languages, such as  Portuguese  (also spoken by Angolan and Mozambican blacks), German, and  Greek , while some  Asians  and  Indians  in South Africa speak  South Asian  languages, such as  Tamil ,  Hindi ,  Gujarati ,  Urdu  and  Telugu .  French  is still widely spoken by French South Africans especially in places like  Franschhoek , where many South Africans are of French origin. South African French is spoken by less than 10,000 individuals. Congolese French is also spoken in South Africa by migrants.

Other sports with significant support are  swimming ,  golf  and  netball .  Basketball ,  surfing  and  skateboarding  are popular among the youth.   Famous boxing personalities include Baby Jake  Jacob Matlala ,  Vuyani Bungu ,  Welcome Ncita ,  Dingaan Thobela ,  Gerrie Coetzee  and  Brian Mitchell . Football players who have excelled in international clubs include  Lucas Radebe  of  Leeds United  and  Quinton Fortune , formerly of  Manchester United ,  Benni McCarthy  and  Aaron Mokoena  of  Blackburn Rovers  and  Steven Pienaar  of  Everton . South Africa produced  Formula 1  motor racing's 1979 world champion  Jody Scheckter .   South Africa hosted and won the  1995 Rugby World Cup  at their first attempt and again won the  2007 Rugby World Cup  in  France . South Africa was only allowed to participate from 1995 since the end of  Apartheid . It followed the 1995 Rugby World Cup by hosting and winning the  1996 African Cup of Nations  football tournament. It also hosted the  2003 Cricket World Cup  and the  2007 World Twenty20 Championship . South Africa will be the host nation for the  2010 FIFA World Cup , which will be the first time the tournament is held on the African continent.   In 2004, the swim team of  Roland Schoeman ,  Lyndon Ferns ,  Darian Townsend  and  Ryk Neethling  won the gold medal at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, simultaneously breaking the world record in the 4x100 freestyle relay.  Penny Heyns  won Olympic Gold in the 1996  Atlanta Olympic Games .   In golf,  Gary Player  is generally regarded as one of the greatest golfers of all time, having won the  Career Grand Slam , one of five golfers to have done so. Other South African golfers to have successfully won a major tournament include  Bobby Locke ,  Ernie Els ,  Retief Goosen  and  Trevor Immelman .     Current issues     HIV/AIDS   Main article:  HIV/AIDS in South Africa   The spread of  AIDS  (acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome) is an alarming problem in South Africa with up to 31% of pregnant women found to be HIV infected in 2005 and the infection rate among adults estimated at 20%. [ 81 ]  The link between HIV, a virus spread primarily by sexual contact, and AIDS was long denied by prior president  Thabo Mbeki  and then health minister  Manto Tshabalala-Msimang , who insisted that the many deaths in the country are due to malnutrition, and hence poverty, and not HIV. [ 82 ]  In 2007, in response to international pressure, the government made efforts to fight AIDS. [ 83 ]  In September 2008 Thabo Mbeki was ousted by the ANC and  Kgalema Motlanthe  was appointed for the interim. One of Mr. Motlanthe's first actions was to replace Mrs. Tshabalala-Msimang with the current minister,  Barbara Hogan .   AIDS affects mainly those who are sexually active and is far more prevalent in the black population. Most deaths are people who are also economically active, resulting in many families losing their primary wage earners. This has resulted in many 'AIDS orphans' who in many cases depend on the state for care and financial support. [ 84 ]  It is estimated that there are 1,200,000 orphans in South Africa. [ 84 ]  Many elderly people also lose the support from lost younger members of their family. Roughly 5 million people are infected with the disease. [ 83 ]     Crime   Main article:  Crime in South Africa           Prison  buildings on  Robben Island       According to a survey for the period 19982000 compiled by the  United Nations , South Africa was ranked second for  murder  and first for  assaults  and  rapes  per capita. [ 85 ]  Total crime per capita is 10th out of the 60 countries in the data set.   Crime  has had a pronounced effect on society: many middle-class South Africans moved into  gated communities , abandoning the central business districts of some cities for the relative security of suburbs. This effect is most pronounced in  Johannesburg , although the trend is noticeable in other cities as well. [ citation needed ]  Many emigrants from South Africa also state that crime was a big motivator for them to leave.  Crime against the farming community  has continued to be a major problem. [ 86 ]     Skills migration   Along with many African nations, South Africa has been experiencing a "" brain drain "" in the past 20 years. This is believed to be potentially damaging for the regional economy, [ 87 ]  and is almost certainly detrimental for the well-being of the majority of people reliant on the healthcare infrastructure, given the HIV/AIDS epidemic. [ 88 ]  The skills drain in South Africa tends to demonstrate racial contours (naturally given the skills distribution legacy of South Africa) and has thus resulted in large white South African communities abroad. [ 89 ]     Xenophobia   Main article:  Xenophobia in South Africa   In May 2008 long standing state hostility to African migrants exploded in a series of pogroms that left up to 100 people dead and 100,000 displaced.

The South African coast stretches 2,798 kilometres (1,739 mi) [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  and borders both the  Atlantic  and  Indian   oceans . [ 7 ]  To the north of South Africa lie  Namibia ,  Botswana  and  Zimbabwe , to the east are  Mozambique  and  Swaziland , while the  Kingdom of Lesotho  is an independent  enclave  surrounded by South African territory. [ 8 ]   Modern human beings have inhabited South Africa for more than 100,000 years. [ 9 ]  A century and a half after the discovery of the  Cape Sea Route , the  Dutch East India Company   founded  a refreshment station at what would become  Cape Town  in 1652. [ 10 ]  Cape Town became a British colony in 1806. European settlement expanded during the 1820s as the  Boers  (original  Dutch ,  Flemish ,  German  and  French  settlers) and the British  1820 Settlers  claimed land in the north and east of the country. Conflicts arose among the Xhosa, Zulu and Afrikaner groups. However, the discovery of diamonds and later gold triggered the conflict known as the  Anglo-Boer War  as the Boers and the British fought for the control of the South African mineral wealth. Although the Boers were defeated, limited independence was given to South Africa in 1910 as a British dominion. Anti-British policies focused on ultimate independence which was achieved in 1961 when South Africa was declared a  republic . The leading  National Party  legislated for a continuation of racial segregation begun under Dutch and British colonial rule, Boer republics, and subsequent South African governments (and which in 1948 became legally institutionalised  segregation  known as  apartheid ), despite opposition both in and outside of the country. In 1990 the then president  F.W. de Klerk  began to dismantle this legislation, and in 1994 the first democratic election was held in South Africa. This election brought  Nelson Mandela  and the current ruling party, the  African National Congress  to power, and the country rejoined the  Commonwealth of Nations .   South Africa is known for its diversity in cultures, languages, and religious beliefs, and eleven official languages are recognised in its  constitution . [ 7 ]  English is the most commonly spoken language in official and commercial public life, however it is only the fifth most spoken home language. [ 7 ]  South Africa is ethnically diverse, with the largest  Caucasian ,  Indian , and  racially mixed  communities in Africa. Although 79.6% of the South African population is  Black , [ 2 ]  this category is neither culturally nor linguistically homogeneous, as people within this classification speak a number of different  Bantu languages , nine of which have official status. [ 7 ]  Midyear 2007, the South African population was estimated at 47.9 million.

(September 2008)       Main article:  History of South Africa   South Africa contains some of the oldest archaeological sites in the world. [ 11 ]   [ 12 ]  Extensive fossil remains at the  Sterkfontein ,  Kromdraai  and Makapansgat caves suggest that various  australopithecines  existed in South Africa from about three million years ago. [ 13 ]  These were succeeded by various species of  Homo , including  Homo habilis ,  Homo erectus  and modern humans,  Homo sapiens . Settlements of  Bantu -speaking peoples, who were  iron -using agriculturists and herdsmen, were already present south of the  Limpopo River  by the fourth or fifth century (see  Bantu expansion ) displacing and absorbing the original  KhoiSan  speakers. They slowly moved south and the earliest ironworks in modern-day  KwaZulu-Natal Province  are believed to date from around 1050. The southernmost group was the  Xhosa  people, whose language incorporates certain linguistic traits from the earlier KhoiSan people, reaching the  Fish River , in today's  Eastern Cape Province . These  Iron Age  populations displaced earlier people, who often had  hunter-gatherer  societies, as they migrated.     European colonisation          Painting of an account of the arrival of  Jan van Riebeeck , the first  European  to settle in South Africa, with  Devil's Peak  in the background       In 1487, the  Portuguese  explorer  Bartolomeu Dias  became the first European to reach the southernmost point of Africa. Initially named The Cape of Storms, The King of Portugal,  John II , renamed it the  Cabo da Boa Esperana  or  Cape of Good Hope  as it led to the riches of India. This great feat of navigation was later immortalised in  Cames ' epic Portuguese poem,  The Lusiads  (1572). In 1652, a refreshment station was established at the  Cape of Good Hope  by  Jan van Riebeeck  on behalf of the  Dutch East India Company .  Slaves  were brought from  Indonesia ,  Madagascar , and India as a labour source for the Dutch immigrants in  Cape Town . As they expanded east, the Dutch settlers eventually met the south-westerly expanding  Xhosa  people in the region of the  Fish River . A series of wars, called the  Cape Frontier Wars , ensued, mainly caused by conflicting land and livestock interests.   Great Britain  took over the  Cape of Good Hope  area in 1795 ostensibly to stop it falling into the hands of the Revolutionary French, but also seeking to use  Cape Town  in particular as a stop on the route to Australia and India. It was later returned to the Dutch in 1803, but soon afterwards the  Dutch East India Company  declared bankruptcy, and the British annexed the Cape Colony in 1806. The British continued the frontier wars against the Xhosa, pushing the eastern frontier eastward through a line of forts established along the Fish River and consolidating it by encouraging  British settlement . Due to pressure of  abolitionist  societies in Britain, the  British parliament  first stopped its global  slave trade  with the passage of the  Slave Trade Act 1807 , then abolished slavery in all its colonies with the  Slavery Abolition Act 1833 . During the 1830s, approximately 12 000  Boers  (later known as  Voortrekkers ), departed from the  Cape Colony , where they were subjected to British control, to the future Natal, Orange Free State and Transvaal regions. The Boers founded the  Boer Republics  - the  South African Republic  (Now  Gauteng ,  Limpopo ,  Mpumalanga  and  North West  provinces) and the  Orange Free State  ( Free State ).   The discovery of  diamonds  in 1867 and  gold  in 1884 in the interior encouraged economic growth and immigration, intensifying the subjugation of the indigenous people. These important economic resources did not only play a role between European and the indigenous population but also between the Boers and the British. [ 14 ]   The  Boer Republics  successfully resisted British encroachments during the  First Boer War  (18801881) using  guerrilla warfare  tactics, much better suited to local conditions. However, the British returned in greater numbers, more experience, and more suitable tactics in the  Second Boer War  (18991902). The Boers' attempt to ally themselves with  German South-West Africa  provided the British with yet another excuse to take control of the Boer Republics. [ citation needed ]           Boers  in combat (1881).         Independence   After four years of negotiating, the  Union of South Africa  was created from the  Cape  and  Natal  colonies, as well as the republics of  Orange Free State  and  Transvaal , on 31 May 1910, exactly eight years after the end of the Second Boer War. The newly created Union of South Africa was a  dominion . The  Natives' Land Act  of 1913 severely restricted the ownership of land by 'blacks', at that stage to a mere 7% of the country, although this amount was eventually increased marginally. [ 15 ]  The union was effectively granted independence from the United Kingdom with the passage of the  Statute of Westminster , which morphed the  British king's  position within South Africa into that of the distinct  King of South Africa . In 1934, the  South African Party  and  National Party  merged to form the  United Party , seeking reconciliation between Afrikaners and English-speaking ""Whites"", but split in 1939 over the entry of the Union into  World War II  as an ally of the United Kingdom, a move which the National Party strongly opposed.   In 1948, the  National Party  was elected to power, and intensified the implementation of racial segregation that had begun under Dutch and British colonial rule, and subsequent South African governments since the Union was formed. The Nationalist Government systematised existing segregationist laws, and the system of segregation became known collectively as  apartheid . Not surprisingly, this segregation also applied to the wealth acquired during rapid industrialisation of the 1950s, '60s, and '70s. While the White minority enjoyed the highest  standard of living  in all of Africa, often comparable to  First World  western nations, the Black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard, including income, education, housing, and life expectancy. On 31 May 1961, following a whites-only  referendum , the country became a  republic  and left the (British)  Commonwealth . The office of  Governor-General  was abolished and replaced with the position of  State President .   Apartheid became increasingly controversial, leading to widespread  sanctions ,  divestment  and growing unrest and oppression within South Africa. (See also the article on the  History of South Africa in the apartheid era .) A long period of harsh suppression by the government, and at times violent resistance,  strikes , marches, protests, and  sabotage  by bombing and other means, by various anti-apartheid movements, most notably the  African National Congress  (ANC), followed. In the late 1970s, South Africa began a programme of  nuclear weapons  development and in the following decade it produced six deliverable nuclear weapons. The rationale for the nuclear arsenal is disputed, but it is believed [ who? ]  that  Vorster  and  P.W. Botha  wanted to be able to catalyse American intervention in the event of a war between South Africa and the  Cuban -supported  MPLA  government of  Angola .     Democracy   In 1990 the  National Party  government took the first step towards negotiating itself out of power when it lifted the ban on the  African National Congress  and other  left-wing  political organisations, and released  Nelson Mandela  from prison after twenty-seven years' incarceration on a  sabotage  sentence. Apartheid legislation was gradually removed from the statute books, and South Africa also destroyed its nuclear arsenal and acceded to the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . The first  multi-racial elections  were held in 1994, which the ANC won by an overwhelming majority. It has been in power ever since.   In  post-apartheid South Africa , millions of South Africans, mostly black, continued to live in  poverty , though poverty among whites, previously rare, has increased greatly. [ 16 ]  While some have partly attributed this to the legacy of the apartheid system, increasingly many attribute it to the failure of the current government to tackle social issues, coupled with the monetary and fiscal discipline of the current government to ensure both redistribution of wealth and economic growth. Since the ANC-led government took power, the  United Nations   Human Development Index  of South Africa has fallen, while it was steadily rising until the mid-1990s. [ 17 ]  Some of this could possibly be attributed to the  AIDS   pandemic  and the failure of the government to take steps to address it, [ 18 ] some of it can also be pinpointed to a government policy of  redistribution of wealth . As a mitigating factor, the social housing policy of the current government has produced an improvement in living conditions.     Politics   Main articles:  Politics of South Africa ,  Government of South Africa , and  Law of South Africa          The  Union Buildings  in  Pretoria  is the home of the South African executive.       South Africa has three capital cities:  Cape Town , the largest of the three, is the  legislative  capital;  Pretoria  is the  administrative  capital; and  Bloemfontein  is the  judicial  capital. South Africa has a  bicameral   parliament : the  National Council of Provinces  (the  upper house ) has 90 members, while the  National Assembly  (the  lower house ) has 400 members. Members of the lower house are elected on a population basis by  proportional representation : half of the members are elected from national lists and the other half are elected from provincial lists. Ten members are elected to represent each province in the National Council of Provinces, regardless of the population of the province. Elections for both chambers are held every five years. The government is formed in the lower house, and the leader of the majority party in the National Assembly is the  President .   The primary sources of South Africa law are Roman-Dutch mercantile law and personal law with English Common law, as imports of Dutch settlements and  British colonialism . [ 19 ]  The first European based law in South Africa was brought by the  Dutch East India Company  and is called  Roman-Dutch law . It was imported before the  codification  of European law into the  Napoleonic Code  and is comparable in many ways to  Scots law . This was followed in the 19th century by  English law , both  common  and  statutory . Starting in 1910 with unification, South Africa had its own  parliament  which passed laws specific for South Africa, building on those previously passed for the individual member colonies.   Current South African politics are dominated by the  African National Congress  (ANC), which received 69.7% of the vote during the last  2004 general election  and 66.3% of the vote in the  2006 municipal election . The current  President of South Africa  is  Kgalema Motlanthe , who replaced  Thabo Mbeki  on 25 September 2008. Mbeki succeeded former President  Nelson Mandela  in 1999, and was re-elected for a second five year term in 2004, but announced his resignation on 20 September 2008.   The main challenger to the rule of the ANC is the  Democratic Alliance  party, which received 12.4% of the vote in the 2004 election and 14.8% in the 2006 election.  Helen Zille , (elected 6 May 2007), is the party leader; the previous leader was  Tony Leon . The formerly dominant  New National Party , which introduced apartheid through its predecessor, the  National Party , chose to merge with the ANC on 9 April 2005. Other major political parties represented in Parliament are the  Inkatha Freedom Party , which mainly represents  Zulu  voters, and the  Independent Democrats , who took 6.97% and 1.7% of the vote respectively, in the 2004 election.   Since 2004, the country has had many thousands of popular protests, some violent, making it, according to one academic, the ""most protest-rich country in the world"". [ 20 ]  Many of these protests have been organised from the growing  shanty towns  that surround South African cities.     Foreign relations and military   Main articles:  South African National Defence Force ,  Foreign relations of South Africa , and  South Africa and weapons of mass destruction   Since the end of apartheid, the South African foreign policy has focused on its African partners particularly in the  Southern African Development Community  (SADC) and the  African Union . South Africa has played a key role as a mediator in African conflicts over the last decade, such as in  Burundi , the  Democratic Republic of Congo , the  Comoros , and  Zimbabwe . After apartheid ended, South Africa was readmitted to the  Commonwealth of Nations . As the  Union of South Africa , South Africa was a founding member of the  United Nations  and the then Prime Minister  Jan Smuts  wrote the preamble to its constitution. South Africa is currently a non-permanent member of the  United Nations Security Council  and has attracted controversy by voting against a resolution criticising the  Burmese  government in 2006 and against the implementation of sanctions against  Zimbabwe  in 2008. South Africa is a member of the  Group of 77  and chaired the organisation in 2006. South Africa is a member of the  South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone ,  Southern African Customs Union ,  World Trade Organization ,  International Monetary Fund ,  G20  and  G8+5 .   The South African  armed forces , known as the  South African National Defence Force  (SANDF), was created in 1994. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  Previously known as the  South African Defence Force  (SADF), the new force is an all volunteer army and consists of the forces of the old SADF, as well as the forces of the African nationalist groups, namely  Umkhonto we Sizwe  (MK),  Azanian People's Liberation Army  (APLA), and the former  Bantustan  defence forces. [ 21 ]  The SANDF is subdivided into four branches, the  South African Army , the  South African Air Force , the  South African Navy , and the  South African Military Health Services . [ 23 ]   In recent years, the SANDF has become a major  peacekeeping  force in Africa, [ 24 ]  and has been involved in operations in  Lesotho , the  Democratic Republic of the Congo , [ 24 ]  and  Burundi , [ 24 ]  amongst others. It has also participated as a part of multi-national  UN  peacekeeping forces.   South Africa undertook a nuclear weapons programme in the 1970s [ 25 ]  and  may have conducted  a nuclear test over the  Atlantic  in 1979. [ 26 ]  It is the only African country to have successfully  developed nuclear weapons . It has become the first country (followed by Ukraine) with nuclear capability to voluntarily renounce and dismantle its programme and in the process signed the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty  in 1991.

To this end, it abolished the four former provinces of South Africa ( Cape Province ,  Natal ,  Orange Free State , and  Transvaal ) and replaced them with nine fully integrated provinces. The new provinces are usually much smaller than the former provinces, which theoretically gives local governments more resources to distribute over smaller areas.   The nine provinces are further subdivided into  52 districts :  6 metropolitan  and  46 district municipalities . The 46 district municipalities are further subdivided into  231 local municipalities . The district municipalities also contain 20 district management areas (mostly game parks) that are directly governed by the district municipalities. The six metropolitan municipalities perform the functions of both district and local municipalities.

At 470,979  sq mi  (1,219,912 km), [ 27 ]  South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world (after  Mali ). It is comparable in size to  Colombia .  Njesuthi  in the  Drakensberg  at 3,408 m (11,424 ft) is the highest peak in South Africa.          View of the  Drakensberg mountains , the highest mountain range in South Africa.       South Africa has a generally  temperate climate , due in part to it being surrounded by the  Atlantic  and  Indian Oceans  on three sides, by its location in the climatically milder  southern hemisphere  and due to the average elevation rising steadily towards the north (towards the  equator ) and further inland. Due to this varied topography and oceanic influence, a great variety of climatic zones exist.   The climatic zones vary, from the extreme  desert  of the southern  Namib  in the farthest northwest to the lush  subtropical  climate in the east along the  Mozambique  border and the  Indian  ocean. From the east, the land quickly rises over a  mountainous   escarpment  towards the interior  plateau  known as the  Highveld . Even though South Africa is classified as  semi-arid , there is considerable variation in  climate  as well as  topography .   The interior of South Africa is a vast, rather flat, and sparsely populated  scrubland ,  Karoo , which is drier towards the northwest along the Namib desert. In contrast, the eastern coastline is lush and well-watered, which produces a climate similar to the tropics. The extreme southwest has a climate remarkably similar to that of the  Mediterranean  with wet winters and hot, dry summers, hosting the famous  Fynbos   Biome . This area also produces much of the  wine  in South Africa. This region is also particularly known for its wind, which blows intermittently almost all year. The severity of this wind made passing around the  Cape of Good Hope  particularly treacherous for sailors, causing many  shipwrecks . Further east on the south coast, rainfall is distributed more evenly throughout the year, producing a green landscape. This area is popularly known as the  Garden Route .          Satellite picture of South Africa       The  Free State  is particularly flat due to the fact that it lies centrally on the high plateau. North of the  Vaal River , the Highveld becomes better watered and does not experience subtropical extremes of heat.  Johannesburg , in the centre of the Highveld, is at 1,740 metres (5,709 ft) and receives an annual rainfall of 760 millimetres (30  in ). Winters in this region are cold, although  snow  is rare.   To the north of Johannesburg, the altitude drops beyond the escarpment of the Highveld, and turns into the lower lying Bushveld, an area of mixed dry forest and an abundance of wildlife. East of the Highveld, beyond the eastern escarpment, the Lowveld stretches towards the  Indian  ocean. It has particularly high temperatures, and is also the location of extended subtropical agriculture.   The high  Drakensberg mountains , which form the south-eastern escarpment of the Highveld, offer limited  skiing  opportunities in winter. The coldest place in South Africa is  Sutherland  in the western  Roggeveld Mountains , where midwinter temperatures can reach as low as 15 degrees  Celsius  (5  F ). The deep interior has the hottest temperatures: A temperature of 51.7 C (125 F) was recorded in 1948 in the  Northern Cape  Kalahari near  Upington . [ 28 ]   South Africa also has one possession, the small sub-Antarctic archipelago of the  Prince Edward Islands , consisting of  Marion Island  (290 km/112 sq mi) and Prince Edward Island (45 km/17.3 sq mi) (not to be confused with the  Canadian province of the same name ).           Weather averages for Cape Town, South Africa         Month   Jan   Feb   Mar   Apr   May   Jun   Jul   Aug   Sep   Oct   Nov   Dec   Year       Average high C (F)   27  (81)   28  (82)   26  (79)   24  (75)   20  (68)   18  (64)   17  (63)   18  (64)   19  (66)   22  (72)   24  (75)   26  (79)   28  (82)       Average low C (F)   16  (61)   16  (61)   15  (59)   13  (55)   10  (50)   8  (46)   8  (46)   8  (46)   9  (48)   11  (52)   14  (57)   15  (59)   8  (46)       Precipitation  mm (inches)   16.5  (0.65)   13  (0.51)   20  (0.79)   54  (2.13)   92  (3.62)   111  (4.37)   96  (3.78)   87  (3.43)   56  (2.2)   40  (1.57)   24  (0.94)   18  (0.71)   627  (24.69)       Source: EuroWEATHER [ 29 ]  2008-02-22         Flora and fauna   See also:  Wildlife of South Africa   See also:  Protected areas of South Africa           Fynbos , a  floral kingdom  unique to South Africa, is found near  Cape Town               Swartberg  mountains near the town of  Oudtshoorn              A field of flowers in Weskus National Park.       South Africa is one of only 17 countries worldwide considered  megadiverse . It has more than 20,000 different  plants , or about 10% of all the known  species  of plants on  Earth , making it particularly rich in plant biodiversity. South Africa is the 6th most biodiverse country, [ 30 ]  after  Brazil ,  Colombia ,  Indonesia ,  China , and  Mexico . The most prevalent biome in South Africa is the  grassland , particularly on the  Highveld , where the plant cover is dominated by different  grasses , low  shrubs , and  acacia trees , mainly camel-thorn and whitethorn.  Vegetation  becomes even more sparse towards the northwest due to low  rainfall . There are several species of water-storing  succulents  like  aloes  and euphorbias in the very hot and dry  Namaqualand  area. The grass and thorn  savannah  turns slowly into a bush savannah towards the north-east of the country, with denser growth. There are significant numbers of  baobab  trees in this area, near the northern end of  Kruger National Park . [ 31 ]   The  Fynbos   Biome , which makes up the majority of the area and plant life in the  Cape floristic region , one of the six  floral kingdoms , is located in a small region of the  Western Cape  and contains more than 9,000 of those species, making it among the richest regions on earth in terms of floral biodiversity. The majority of the plants are  evergreen  hard-leaf plants with fine, needle-like  leaves , such as the  sclerophyllous  plants. Another uniquely South African plant is the  protea  genus of flowering plants. There are around 130 different species of protea in South Africa.   While South Africa has a great wealth of flowering plants, it has few  forests . Only 1% of South Africa is forest, almost exclusively in the  humid   coastal plain  along the  Indian Ocean  in  KwaZulu-Natal  (see  KwaZulu-Cape coastal forest mosaic ). There are even smaller reserves of forests that are out of the reach of  fire , known as montane forests (see  Knysna-Amatole montane forests ).  Plantations  of imported tree species are predominant, particularly the non-native  eucalyptus  and  pine . South Africa has lost a large area of natural habitat in the last four decades, primarily due to  overpopulation , sprawling development patterns and  deforestation  during the nineteenth century. South Africa is one of the worst affected countries in the world when it comes to invasion by alien species with many (e.g.  Black Wattle ,  Port Jackson ,  Hakea ,  Lantana  and  Jacaranda ) posing a significant threat to the native  biodiversity  and the already scarce water resources. The original  temperate forest  that met the first European settlers to South Africa was exploited ruthlessly until only small patches remained. Currently, South African  hardwood  trees like  Real Yellowwood   (Podocarpus latifolius) ,  stinkwood   (Ocotea bullata) , and South African  Black Ironwood   (Olea laurifolia)  are under government protection.   Numerous  mammals  are found in the  bushveld  habitats including  lions ,  leopards ,  white rhinos ,  blue wildebeest ,  kudus ,  impalas ,  hyenas ,  hippopotamus  and  giraffes . A significant extent of the bushveld habitat exists in the north-east including  Kruger National Park  and the  Mala Mala  Reserve, as well as in the far north in the  Waterberg Biosphere .   Climate change is expected to bring considerable warming and drying to much of this already semi-arid region, with greater frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, flooding and drought. According to computer generated climate modelling produced by the South African National Biodiversity Institute [ 32 ]  parts of southern Africa will see an increase in temperature by about one degree Celsius along the coast to more than four degrees Celsius in the already hot hinterland such as the  Northern Cape  in late spring and summertime by 2050.   The Cape Floral Kingdom has been identified as one of the global  biodiversity hotspots  since it will be hit very hard by  climate change  and has such a great diversity of life. Drought, increased intensity and frequency of fire and climbing temperatures are expected to push many of these  rare species  towards  extinction .   South Africa houses many endemic species, among them the  critically endangered   Riverine Rabbit  ( Bunolagus monticullaris ) in the  Karoo .     Economy   Main article:  Economy of South Africa          The  Victoria & Alfred Waterfront  in  Cape Town  with  Table Mountain  in the background. Cape Town has become an important  retail  and  tourism  centre for the country, and attracts the largest number of foreign visitors in South Africa       By  UN  classification South Africa is a middle-income country with an abundant supply of resources, well-developed financial, legal, communications, energy, and transport sectors, a  stock exchange  (the  JSE Limited ), that ranks among the top twenty in the world, and a modern infrastructure supporting an efficient distribution of goods to major urban centres throughout the entire region. South Africa is ranked 25th in the world in terms of  GDP  (PPP) as of 2007.   Advanced development is significantly localised around four areas: Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Durban, and Pretoria/Johannesburg. Beyond these four economic centres, development is marginal and poverty is still prevalent despite government efforts. Consequently the vast majority of South Africans are poor. However, key marginal areas have experienced rapid growth recently. Such areas include Mossel Bay to Plettenberg Bay; Rustenburg area; Nelspruit area; Bloemfontein; Cape West Coast; and the KwaZulu-Natal North Coast.   Even though South Africa has the seventh highest per capita income in Africa, only behind  Libya ,  Mauritius  it suffers from large income gaps and a  dual economy  marking it as a  developing country . South Africa has one of the highest rates of  income inequality  in the world. A decade of continual economic growth has helped to lower unemployment, but daunting economic and social problems remain. The average South African household income decreased considerably between 1995 and 2000. As for racial inequality,  Statistics South Africa  reported that in 1995 the average white household earned four times as much as the average black household. In 2000 the average white household was earning six times more than the average black household. [ 33 ]  The  affirmative action  policies have seen a rise in black economic wealth and an emerging black middle class. [ 34 ]  Other problems are crime, corruption, and  HIV / AIDS .   At the start of 2000, then President Thabo Mbeki vowed to promote economic growth and foreign investment by relaxing restrictive labour laws, stepping up the pace of  privatisation , and cutting unneeded governmental spending. His policies face strong opposition from organised  labour . South Africa is also the largest energy producer and consumer on the continent. South Africa is a popular tourist destination, and a substantial amount of revenue comes from tourism. [ 35 ]  Among the main attractions are the diverse and picturesque culture, the game reserves and the highly regarded local wines.   The South African  rand  (ZAR), is the most actively traded emerging  market currency  in the world. It has joined an elite club of fifteen currencies, the  Continuous linked settlement  (CLS), where forex transactions are settled immediately, lowering the risks of transacting across  time zones . The rand was the best-performing currency against the  United States dollar  (USD) between 2002 and 2005, according to the  Bloomberg  Currency Scorecard.   The volatility of the  rand  has affected economic activity, falling sharply during 2001 and hitting a historic low of 13.85  ZAR  to the  USD , raising fears of inflation, and causing the Reserve Bank to increase  interest rates . The rand has since recovered, trading at 7.13 ZAR to the dollar as of January 2008. However, as exporters are put under considerable pressure from a stronger domestic currency, many call for government intervention to help soften the rand.   Refugees from poorer neighbouring countries include many immigrants from the DRC, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Malawi and others, representing a large portion of the informal sector. With high unemployment levels amongst poorer South Africans,  xenophobia  is prevalent and many people born in South Africa feel resentful of immigrants who are seen to be depriving the native population of jobs, a feeling which has been given credibility by the fact that many South African employers have employed migrants from other countries for lower pay than South African citizens, especially in the  construction ,  tourism ,  agriculture  and  domestic service  industries. Illegal immigrants are also heavily involved in informal trading. [ 36 ]  However, many immigrants to South Africa continue to live in poor conditions, and the South African immigration policy has become increasingly restrictive since 1994. [ 37 ]   Principal international trading partners of South Africa  besides other African countries  include  Germany , the  United States ,  China ,  Japan , the  United Kingdom  and  Spain .  [ 38 ]  Chief exports include  corn ,  diamonds ,  fruits ,  gold ,  metals  and  minerals ,  sugar , and  wool .  Machinery  and transportation equipment make up more than one-third of the value of the countrys imports. Other imports include  chemicals , manufactured goods, and  petroleum .     Electricity crisis   After unsuccessful attempts by the government to encourage private construction of electricity generation capacity, in 2007 the state-owned electricity supplier ( Eskom ) started experiencing a lack of capacity in the electrical generating and reticulation infrastructure. This led to an inability to meet the routine demands of industry and consumers, resulting in countrywide  rolling blackouts . Initially the lack of capacity was triggered by a failure at  Koeberg nuclear power station , but since then a general lack of capacity became evident. The supplier has been widely criticised for failing to adequately plan for and construct sufficient electrical generating capacity, [ 39 ]  although ultimately the government has admitted that it is at fault for refusing to approve funding for investment in infrastructure. [ 40 ]     Agriculture          Workers planting on a farm in the central area of  Mpumalanga .               Farm  workers.       South Africa has a large agricultural sector and is a net exporter of  farming  products. There are almost a thousand  agricultural cooperatives  and  agribusinesses  throughout the country, and agricultural exports have constituted 8% of South African total exports for the past five years. The agricultural industry contributes around 10% of formal employment, relatively low compared to other parts of Africa, as well as providing work for casual labourers and contributing around 2.6% of  GDP  for the nation. [ 41 ]  However, due to the  aridity  of the land, only 13.5% can be used for crop production, and only 3% is considered high potential land. [ 42 ]   Although the commercial farming sector is relatively well developed, people in some rural areas still survive on  subsistence agriculture . It is the eighth largest wine producer in the world, and the eleventh largest producer of sunflower seed. South Africa is a net exporter of agricultural products and foodstuffs, the largest number of exported items being  sugar ,  grapes ,  citrus ,  nectarines ,  wine  and  deciduous  fruit. The largest locally produced crop is  maize  (corn), and it has been estimated that 9 million tons are produced every year, with 7.4 million tons being consumed.  Livestock  are also popular on South African farms, with the country producing 85% of all meat consumed. The dairy industry consists of around 4,300 milk producers providing employment for 60,000 farm workers and contributing to the livelihoods of around 40,000 others. [ 43 ]   In recent years, the agricultural sector has introduced several reforms, some of which are controversial, such as  land reform  and the deregulation of the market for agricultural products. Land reform has been criticised both by farmers' groups and by landless workers, the latter alleging that the pace of change has not been fast enough, and the former alleging racist treatment and expressing concerns that a similar situation to  Zimbabwe's land reform policy  may develop, [ 44 ]  a fear exacerbated by comments made by  deputy president , the deputy president of South Africa. [ 45 ] [ 46 ]  The sector continues to face problems, with increased foreign competition and crime being two of the major challenges for the industry. The government has been accused of either putting in too much effort [ 47 ] , or not enough effort [ 48 ] , to tackle the problem of  farm attacks  as opposed to other forms of violent crime.   Another issue which affects South African agriculture is environmental damage caused by misuse of the land and global climate change. South Africa is unusually vulnerable to climate change and resultant diminution of surface waters. Some predictions show surface water supply could decrease by 60% by the year 2070 in parts of the Western Cape. [ 49 ]  To reverse the damage caused by land mismanagement, the government has supported a scheme which promotes  sustainable development  and the use of natural resources. [ 50 ]  Maize production, which contributes to a 36% majority of the gross value of South Africas field crops, has also experienced negative effects due to climate change. The estimated value of loss, which takes into consideration scenarios with and without the carbon dioxide fertilisation effect  [2]  ,ranges between 10s to 100s of millions of Rands.

South Africa is a nation of more than 48 million people of diverse origins,  cultures ,  languages , and  religions . The last  census  was held in 2001 and the next will be in 2011.  Statistics South Africa  provided five  racial  categories by which people could classify themselves, the last of which, ""unspecified/other"" drew negligible responses, and these results were omitted. [ 52 ]  The 2006 midyear estimated figures for the other categories were  Black African  at 79.5%,  White  at 9.2%,  Coloured  at 8.9%, and  Indian or Asian  at 2.5%. [ 53 ]  Even though the population of South Africa has increased in the past decade [ 52 ] [ 54 ]  (primarily due to immigration), the country had an annual population growth rate of 0.501% in 2008 (CIA est.), including immigration. [ 55 ]  South Africa is home to an estimated 5 million  illegal immigrants , including some 3 million  Zimbabweans . [ 56 ] [ 57 ] [ 58 ]  A series of  anti-immigrant riots  occurred in South Africa beginning on 11 May 2008. [ 59 ] [ 60 ]   By far the major part of the population classified itself as African or black, but it is not culturally or linguistically homogeneous. Major ethnic groups include the  Zulu ,  Xhosa ,  Basotho  (South Sotho),  Bapedi  (North Sotho),  Venda ,  Tswana ,  Tsonga ,  Swazi  and  Ndebele , all of which speak  Bantu languages  (see  Bantu peoples of South Africa ).   Some, such as the Zulu, Xhosa, Bapedi and Venda groups, are unique to South Africa. Other groups are distributed across the borders with neighbours of South Africa: The  Basotho  group is also the major ethnic group in  Lesotho . The  Tswana  ethnic group constitute the majority of the population of  Botswana . The  Swazi  ethnic group is the major ethnic group in  Swaziland . The  Ndebele  ethnic group is also found in  Matabeleland  in  Zimbabwe , where they are known as the  Matabele . These Ndebele people are the descendants of a Zulu faction under the warrior  Mzilikazi  that escaped persecution from  Shaka  by migrating to their current territory. The  Tsonga  ethnic group is also found in southern  Mozambique , where they are known as the Shangaan.   The white population is not ethnically homogeneous and descend from many ethnic groups:  Dutch ,  Flemish ,  Portuguese , German, French  Huguenot , English, Irish, Italian, Scottish and  Welsh . Culturally and linguistically, they are divided into the  Afrikaners , who speak  Afrikaans , and English-speaking groups, many of whom are descended from British and Irish immigrants (see  Anglo-African ). Many small communities that have immigrated over the last century retain the use of other languages. The  white population  is on the decrease due to a low birth rate and emigration; as a factor in their decision to emigrate, many cite the high  crime  rate and the  affirmative action  policies of the government. Since 1994, approximately 1 000 000 white South Africans have permanently emigrated. [ 61 ] [ 62 ] [ 63 ] [ 64 ]  Despite high emigration levels, a high level of non-South African white immigrants have settled in the country, in particular from countries such as  Britain  and  Zimbabwe . For example, by 2005, an estimated 212 000 British citizens were residing in South Africa. Since 2003, the numbers of British migrants coming to South Africa has risen by 50%. An estimated 20 000 British migrants moved to South Africa in 2007. There have also been a significant number of  white Zimbabwean  arrivals, fleeing their home country in light of the economic and political problems currently facing the country. As well as recent arrivals, a significant number of white Zimbabweans emigrated to South Africa in the wake of independence in Zimbabwe in 1980. Some of the more nostalgic members of the community are known in popular culture as "" Whenwes "", because of their nostalgia for their lives in  Rhodesia  ""when we were in Rhodesia"". [ 65 ]   The term  Coloured  is still largely used for the people of mixed race descended from slaves brought in from East and Central Africa, the indigenous  Khoisan  who lived in the  Cape  at the time, Bantus, Whites (mostly the  Dutch / Afrikaner  and British settlers) as well as an admixture of  Javanese ,  Malay , Indian,  Malagasy  and Asian blood (such as  Burmese ). The majority speak Afrikaans. Khoisan is a term used to describe two separate groups, physically similar: light-skinned and small in stature. The  Khoikhoi , who were called  Hottentots  by the Europeans, were pastoralists and were annihilated; the San, called  Bushmen  by the Europeans, were hunter-gatherers. Within the Coloured community, more recent immigrants will also be found: Coloureds from the former  Rhodesia  (now  Zimbabwe );  Namibia  and immigrants of mixed descent from India and  Burma  ( Anglo-Indians / Anglo-Burmese ) who were welcomed to the Cape when India and Burma received their Independence.   The major part of the South African  Asian  population is Indian in origin (see  Indian South Africans ); many of them descended from indentured workers brought in the nineteenth century to work on the  sugar   plantations  of the eastern coastal area then known as  Natal . There is also a significant group of  Chinese South Africans  (approximately 100,000 individuals) and  Vietnamese  South Africans (approximately 50,000 individuals). In 2008, the Pretoria High Court has ruled that Chinese South Africans who arrived before 1994 are to be reclassified as  Coloureds . As a result of this ruling, about 12,000 - 15,000  [ 66 ] ethnically Chinese citizens who arrived before 1994, numbering 3%-5% of the total Chinese population in the country, will be able to benefit from government  BEE  policies. [ 67 ]   South Africa hosts a sizeable refugee and asylum seeker population. According to the  World Refugee Survey 2008 , published by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, this population numbered approximately 144,700 in 2007. [ 68 ]  Groups of refugees and asylum seekers numbering over 10,000 included people from  Zimbabwe  (48,400), The  Democratic Republic of the Congo  (24,800), and  Somalia  (12,900). [ 68 ]  These populations mainly lived in Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban, Cape Town, and Port Elizabeth. [ 68 ]     Science and technology   Several important scientific and technological developments have originated in South Africa.  The first human to human heart transplant was performed by cardiac surgeon  Christiaan Barnard  at  Groote Schuur Hospital  in December 1967  .  Max Theiler  developed a vaccine against Yellow Fever,  Allan McLeod Cormack  pioneered x-ray  Computed tomography , and  Aaron Klug  developed crystallographic electron microscopy techniques. These advancements were all recognised with  Nobel Prizes .  Sydney Brenner  won most recently, in 2002, for his pioneering work in  molecular biology .   Mark Shuttleworth  founded an early Internet security company  Thawte , that was subsequently bought out by world-leader  VeriSign . Despite government efforts to encourage entrepreneurship in biotechnology, IT and other high technology fields, no other notable groundbreaking companies have been founded in South Africa. However, it is the expressed objective of the government to transition the economy to be more reliant on high technology, based on the realisation that South African cannot compete with Far Eastern economies in manufacturing, nor can the republic rely on its mineral wealth in perpetuity.   South Africa has cultivated a burgeoning astronomy community. It hosts the  Southern African Large Telescope , the largest optical telescope in the southern hemisphere. South Africa is currently building the  Karoo Array Telescope  as a pathfinder for the $20 billion  Square Kilometer Array  project. South Africa is a finalist, with Australia, to be the host of the SKA.     Society and culture   Main article:  Culture of South Africa          Decorated houses,  Drakensberg Mountains              Traditional  South African cuisine .       It may be argued that there is no ""single"" culture in South Africa because of its ethnic diversity. Today, the diversity in foods from many cultures is enjoyed by all and especially marketed to tourists who wish to sample the large variety of South African cuisine. In addition to  food ,  music  and  dance  feature prominently.   South African cuisine  is heavily  meat-based  and has spawned the distinctively South African social gathering known as a  braai , or barbecue. South Africa has also developed into a major  wine  producer, with some of the best  vineyards  lying in valleys around  Stellenbosch ,  Franschoek ,  Paarl  and  Barrydale . [ 69 ]   There is great diversity in music from South Africa. Many black musicians who sang in Afrikaans or English during apartheid have since begun to sing in traditional African languages, and have developed a unique style called  Kwaito . Of note is  Brenda Fassie , who launched to fame with her song ""Weekend Special"", which was sung in English. More famous traditional musicians include  Ladysmith Black Mambazo , while the  Soweto String Quartet  performs classic music with an African flavour. White and Coloured South African singers are historically influenced by European musical styles including such western metal bands such as  Seether  (formerly Saron Gas). South Africa has produced world-famous jazz musicians, notably  Hugh Masekela ,  Jonas Gwangwa ,  Abdullah Ibrahim ,  Miriam Makeba ,  Jonathan Butler ,  Chris McGregor , and  Sathima Bea Benjamin .  Afrikaans  music covers multiple genres, such as the  contemporary   Steve Hofmeyr  and the  punk rock  band  Fokofpolisiekar . Crossover artists such as  Johnny Clegg  and his bands  Juluka  and  Savuka  have enjoyed various success underground, publicly, and abroad.   The South African black majority still has a substantial number of rural inhabitants who lead largely impoverished lives. It is among these people, however, that cultural traditions survive most strongly; as blacks have become increasingly  urbanised  and  westernised , aspects of traditional culture have declined. Urban blacks usually speak English or  Afrikaans  in addition to their native tongue. There are smaller but still significant groups of speakers of  Khoisan languages  who are not included in the eleven official languages, but are one of the eight other officially recognised languages. There are small groups of speakers of  endangered languages , most of which are from the Khoi-San family, that receive no official status; however, some groups within South Africa are attempting to promote their use and revival.   The  middle class  lifestyle, predominantly of the white minority but with growing numbers of Black, Coloured and Indian people, [ 70 ]  is similar in many respects to that of people found in  Western Europe , North America and  Australasia . Members of the middle class often study and work abroad for greater exposure to the markets of the world.   Asians , predominantly of Indian origin, preserve their own cultural heritage, languages and religious beliefs, being either  Christian ,  Hindu  or  Sunni Muslim  and speaking English, with Indian languages like  Hindi ,  Telugu ,  Tamil  or  Gujarati  being spoken less frequently, but the majority of Indians being able to understand their mother tongue. The first Indians arrived on the famous  Truro ship  as  indentured labourers  in Natal to work the Sugar Cane Fields. There is a much smaller  Chinese  community in South Africa, although its numbers have increased due to immigration from  Republic of China  (Taiwan).   South Africa has also had a large influence in the  Scouting  movement, with many Scouting traditions and ceremonies coming from the experiences of  Robert Baden-Powell  (the founder of Scouting) during his time in South Africa as a military officer in the 1890s. The  South African Scout Association  was one of the first youth organisations to open its doors to youth and adults of all races in South Africa. This happened on 2 July 1977 at a conference known as  Quo Vadis . [ 71 ]   The South African music scene consists of  Kwaito , a new music genre that had developed in the mid 80s and has since developed to become the most popular social economical form of representation among the populous. Though some may argue that the political aspects of Kwaito has since diminished after  Apartheid , and the relative interest in politics has become a minor aspect of daily life. Some argue that in a sense,  Kwaito  is in fact a political force that shows activism in its apolitical actions. Today, major corporations like  Sony ,  BMG , and  EMI  have appeared on the South African scene to produce and distribute  Kwaito  music. Due to its overwhelming popularity, as well as the general influence of DJs, who are among the top 5 most influential types of people within the country,  Kwaito  has taken over radio, television, and magazines. [ 72 ]   Kwaito , much like most hip-hop has its own local flavor and originality. However, unlike when hip-hop first burst on the scene as a politically driven and rebellious underground movement, South Africans wanted to create a happier vibe. As the post-apartheid fog cleared, South African youth found their ""own voice in a style of music known as kwaito, spawning a new (and profitable) industry"". [ 73 ]  According to TIMEeurope magazine, ""The kwaito sound now regularly incorporates traditional African music, jazz, gospel, and even rock guitar, most notably on Mandoza's 2000 hit Nkalakatha, one of the few kwaito records to cross over onto traditionally white radio"". [ 74 ]  In the kwaito, the samples from old school  Jamaican dancehall , European house, etc.,  tempos  are changed, beats are added, and urban street slang is also incorporated. This local flavour of music more recently has been attacked for its lack of ingenuity and its betrayal of its roots. The melodies and the incorporation of sex and dance have since become very similar to the American standard. In addition Kwaito has been criticised for its absence of influential lyrical content. As Kwaito is still a developing genre, and since the South African population is only around 48 million, sales of only 25,000 CDs are required for ""gold"" certification in South Africa. [ 73 ]     Religion   Main article:  Religion in South Africa           St. Mark 's Anglican Cathedral.       According to the latest 2001 national census, Christians accounted for 79.7% of the population. This includes  Zion Christian  11.1%,  Pentecostal  ( Charismatic ) 8.2%,  Roman Catholic  7.1%,  Methodist  6.8%,  Dutch Reformed  6.7%,  Anglican  3.8%, and other Christian 36%.  Islam  accounted for 1.5% of the population,  Hinduism  about 1.3%, and  Judaism  0.2%. 15.1% had no religious affiliation, 2.3% were other and 1.4% were unspecified. [ 75 ] [ 76 ]   African Indigenous Churches were the largest of the  Christian  groups. It was believed that many of these persons who claimed no affiliation with any organised religion adhered to  traditional indigenous religions . Many peoples have  syncretic  religious practices combining Christian and indigenous influences. [ 77 ]   Islam in South Africa  itself is not known to pre-date the colonial period, despite the isolated contact neighbouring  Mozambique  had with  Arab  and  East African  traders. [ citation needed ]  There is no evidence that Islam was known to the  Zulu ,  Swazi , or  Xhosa  of the east coast prior to the colonial era. Many South African Muslims are described as  Coloureds , notably in the  Western Cape , especially those whose ancestors came as slaves from the Indonesian archipelago (the  Cape Malays ). Others are described as  Indians , notably in  KwaZulu-Natal , including those whose ancestors came as traders from  South Asia ; they have been joined by others from other parts of Africa as well as white or black South African converts. It is estimated that  Islam  is the fastest growing religion of conversion in the country, [ 78 ]  with the number of black  Muslims  growing sixfold, from 12,000 in 1991 to 74,700 in 2004. [ 79 ]   Hinduism  dates back to British Colonial period primarily but later waves of continuous immigrants from India have contributed to a sizeable Hindu population. Most Hindus are ethnically South Asian but there are many who come from mixed racial stock and many are converts with the efforts of Hindu missionaries such as ISKCON. Other religions in smaller numbers are  Sikhism ,  Jainism  and  Bah' Faith . [ 76 ]     Languages   Main article:  Languages of South Africa          Map showing principal South African languages by municipality. Lighter shades indicate a non-majority  plurality .             Afrikaans          Northern Sotho          Southern Sotho          Swati          Tsonga            Tswana          Venda          Xhosa          Zulu               South Africa has eleven  official languages : [ 80 ]   Sepedi ,  Sesotho ,  Setswana ,  siSwati ,  Tshivenda ,  Xitsonga ,  Afrikaans ,  English ,  isiNdebele ,  isiXhosa  and  isiZulu . In this regard it is  second only to India  in number. While each language is formally equal to every other, some languages are spoken more than others. According to the 2001 National Census, the three most spoken first home languages are Zulu (23.8%), Xhosa (17.6%) and Afrikaans (13.3%). [ 52 ]  Despite the fact that English is recognised as the language of commerce and science, it was spoken by only 8.2% of South Africans at home in 2001, an even lower percentage than in 1996 (8.6%). [ 52 ]   There are  eleven official names  for South Africa, one in each of the official national languages. The country also recognises eight non-official languages:  Fanagalo ,  Khoe ,  Lobedu ,  Nama ,  Northern Ndebele ,  Phuthi ,  San  and  South African Sign Language . [ citation needed ]  These non-official languages may be used in certain official uses in limited areas where it has been determined that these languages are prevalent. Nevertheless, their populations are not such that they require nationwide recognition.   Many of the ""unofficial languages"" of the  San  and  Khoikhoi  people contain regional  dialects  stretching northward into Namibia and Botswana, and elsewhere. These people, who are a physically distinct population from other Africans, have their own cultural identity based on their  hunter-gatherer  societies. They have been marginalised to a great extent, and many of their languages are in danger of becoming  extinct .   Many white South Africans also speak other European languages, such as  Portuguese  (also spoken by Angolan and Mozambican blacks), German, and  Greek , while some  Asians  and  Indians  in South Africa speak  South Asian  languages, such as  Tamil ,  Hindi ,  Gujarati ,  Urdu  and  Telugu .  French  is still widely spoken by French South Africans especially in places like  Franschhoek , where many South Africans are of French origin. South African French is spoken by less than 10,000 individuals. Congolese French is also spoken in South Africa by migrants.

Other sports with significant support are  swimming ,  golf  and  netball .  Basketball ,  surfing  and  skateboarding  are popular among the youth.   Famous boxing personalities include Baby Jake  Jacob Matlala ,  Vuyani Bungu ,  Welcome Ncita ,  Dingaan Thobela ,  Gerrie Coetzee  and  Brian Mitchell . Football players who have excelled in international clubs include  Lucas Radebe  of  Leeds United  and  Quinton Fortune , formerly of  Manchester United ,  Benni McCarthy  and  Aaron Mokoena  of  Blackburn Rovers  and  Steven Pienaar  of  Everton . South Africa produced  Formula 1  motor racing's 1979 world champion  Jody Scheckter .   South Africa hosted and won the  1995 Rugby World Cup  at their first attempt and again won the  2007 Rugby World Cup  in  France . South Africa was only allowed to participate from 1995 since the end of  Apartheid . It followed the 1995 Rugby World Cup by hosting and winning the  1996 African Cup of Nations  football tournament. It also hosted the  2003 Cricket World Cup  and the  2007 World Twenty20 Championship . South Africa will be the host nation for the  2010 FIFA World Cup , which will be the first time the tournament is held on the African continent.   In 2004, the swim team of  Roland Schoeman ,  Lyndon Ferns ,  Darian Townsend  and  Ryk Neethling  won the gold medal at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, simultaneously breaking the world record in the 4x100 freestyle relay.  Penny Heyns  won Olympic Gold in the 1996  Atlanta Olympic Games .   In golf,  Gary Player  is generally regarded as one of the greatest golfers of all time, having won the  Career Grand Slam , one of five golfers to have done so. Other South African golfers to have successfully won a major tournament include  Bobby Locke ,  Ernie Els ,  Retief Goosen  and  Trevor Immelman .     Current issues     HIV/AIDS   Main article:  HIV/AIDS in South Africa   The spread of  AIDS  (acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome) is an alarming problem in South Africa with up to 31% of pregnant women found to be HIV infected in 2005 and the infection rate among adults estimated at 20%. [ 81 ]  The link between HIV, a virus spread primarily by sexual contact, and AIDS was long denied by prior president  Thabo Mbeki  and then health minister  Manto Tshabalala-Msimang , who insisted that the many deaths in the country are due to malnutrition, and hence poverty, and not HIV. [ 82 ]  In 2007, in response to international pressure, the government made efforts to fight AIDS. [ 83 ]  In September 2008 Thabo Mbeki was ousted by the ANC and  Kgalema Motlanthe  was appointed for the interim. One of Mr. Motlanthe's first actions was to replace Mrs. Tshabalala-Msimang with the current minister,  Barbara Hogan .   AIDS affects mainly those who are sexually active and is far more prevalent in the black population. Most deaths are people who are also economically active, resulting in many families losing their primary wage earners. This has resulted in many 'AIDS orphans' who in many cases depend on the state for care and financial support. [ 84 ]  It is estimated that there are 1,200,000 orphans in South Africa. [ 84 ]  Many elderly people also lose the support from lost younger members of their family. Roughly 5 million people are infected with the disease. [ 83 ]     Crime   Main article:  Crime in South Africa           Prison  buildings on  Robben Island       According to a survey for the period 19982000 compiled by the  United Nations , South Africa was ranked second for  murder  and first for  assaults  and  rapes  per capita. [ 85 ]  Total crime per capita is 10th out of the 60 countries in the data set.   Crime  has had a pronounced effect on society: many middle-class South Africans moved into  gated communities , abandoning the central business districts of some cities for the relative security of suburbs. This effect is most pronounced in  Johannesburg , although the trend is noticeable in other cities as well. [ citation needed ]  Many emigrants from South Africa also state that crime was a big motivator for them to leave.  Crime against the farming community  has continued to be a major problem. [ 86 ]     Skills migration   Along with many African nations, South Africa has been experiencing a "" brain drain "" in the past 20 years. This is believed to be potentially damaging for the regional economy, [ 87 ]  and is almost certainly detrimental for the well-being of the majority of people reliant on the healthcare infrastructure, given the HIV/AIDS epidemic. [ 88 ]  The skills drain in South Africa tends to demonstrate racial contours (naturally given the skills distribution legacy of South Africa) and has thus resulted in large white South African communities abroad. [ 89 ]     Xenophobia   Main article:  Xenophobia in South Africa   In May 2008 long standing state hostility to African migrants exploded in a series of pogroms that left up to 100 people dead and 100,000 displaced.

The South African coast stretches 2,798 kilometres (1,739 mi) [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  and borders both the  Atlantic  and  Indian   oceans . [ 7 ]  To the north of South Africa lie  Namibia ,  Botswana  and  Zimbabwe , to the east are  Mozambique  and  Swaziland , while the  Kingdom of Lesotho  is an independent  enclave  surrounded by South African territory. [ 8 ]   Modern human beings have inhabited South Africa for more than 100,000 years. [ 9 ]  A century and a half after the discovery of the  Cape Sea Route , the  Dutch East India Company   founded  a refreshment station at what would become  Cape Town  in 1652. [ 10 ]  Cape Town became a British colony in 1806. European settlement expanded during the 1820s as the  Boers  (original  Dutch ,  Flemish ,  German  and  French  settlers) and the British  1820 Settlers  claimed land in the north and east of the country. Conflicts arose among the Xhosa, Zulu and Afrikaner groups. However, the discovery of diamonds and later gold triggered the conflict known as the  Anglo-Boer War  as the Boers and the British fought for the control of the South African mineral wealth. Although the Boers were defeated, limited independence was given to South Africa in 1910 as a British dominion. Anti-British policies focused on ultimate independence which was achieved in 1961 when South Africa was declared a  republic . The leading  National Party  legislated for a continuation of racial segregation begun under Dutch and British colonial rule, Boer republics, and subsequent South African governments (and which in 1948 became legally institutionalised  segregation  known as  apartheid ), despite opposition both in and outside of the country. In 1990 the then president  F.W. de Klerk  began to dismantle this legislation, and in 1994 the first democratic election was held in South Africa. This election brought  Nelson Mandela  and the current ruling party, the  African National Congress  to power, and the country rejoined the  Commonwealth of Nations .   South Africa is known for its diversity in cultures, languages, and religious beliefs, and eleven official languages are recognised in its  constitution . [ 7 ]  English is the most commonly spoken language in official and commercial public life, however it is only the fifth most spoken home language. [ 7 ]  South Africa is ethnically diverse, with the largest  Caucasian ,  Indian , and  racially mixed  communities in Africa. Although 79.6% of the South African population is  Black , [ 2 ]  this category is neither culturally nor linguistically homogeneous, as people within this classification speak a number of different  Bantu languages , nine of which have official status. [ 7 ]  Midyear 2007, the South African population was estimated at 47.9 million.

(September 2008)       Main article:  History of South Africa   South Africa contains some of the oldest archaeological sites in the world. [ 11 ]   [ 12 ]  Extensive fossil remains at the  Sterkfontein ,  Kromdraai  and Makapansgat caves suggest that various  australopithecines  existed in South Africa from about three million years ago. [ 13 ]  These were succeeded by various species of  Homo , including  Homo habilis ,  Homo erectus  and modern humans,  Homo sapiens . Settlements of  Bantu -speaking peoples, who were  iron -using agriculturists and herdsmen, were already present south of the  Limpopo River  by the fourth or fifth century (see  Bantu expansion ) displacing and absorbing the original  KhoiSan  speakers. They slowly moved south and the earliest ironworks in modern-day  KwaZulu-Natal Province  are believed to date from around 1050. The southernmost group was the  Xhosa  people, whose language incorporates certain linguistic traits from the earlier KhoiSan people, reaching the  Fish River , in today's  Eastern Cape Province . These  Iron Age  populations displaced earlier people, who often had  hunter-gatherer  societies, as they migrated.     European colonisation          Painting of an account of the arrival of  Jan van Riebeeck , the first  European  to settle in South Africa, with  Devil's Peak  in the background       In 1487, the  Portuguese  explorer  Bartolomeu Dias  became the first European to reach the southernmost point of Africa. Initially named The Cape of Storms, The King of Portugal,  John II , renamed it the  Cabo da Boa Esperana  or  Cape of Good Hope  as it led to the riches of India. This great feat of navigation was later immortalised in  Cames ' epic Portuguese poem,  The Lusiads  (1572). In 1652, a refreshment station was established at the  Cape of Good Hope  by  Jan van Riebeeck  on behalf of the  Dutch East India Company .  Slaves  were brought from  Indonesia ,  Madagascar , and India as a labour source for the Dutch immigrants in  Cape Town . As they expanded east, the Dutch settlers eventually met the south-westerly expanding  Xhosa  people in the region of the  Fish River . A series of wars, called the  Cape Frontier Wars , ensued, mainly caused by conflicting land and livestock interests.   Great Britain  took over the  Cape of Good Hope  area in 1795 ostensibly to stop it falling into the hands of the Revolutionary French, but also seeking to use  Cape Town  in particular as a stop on the route to Australia and India. It was later returned to the Dutch in 1803, but soon afterwards the  Dutch East India Company  declared bankruptcy, and the British annexed the Cape Colony in 1806. The British continued the frontier wars against the Xhosa, pushing the eastern frontier eastward through a line of forts established along the Fish River and consolidating it by encouraging  British settlement . Due to pressure of  abolitionist  societies in Britain, the  British parliament  first stopped its global  slave trade  with the passage of the  Slave Trade Act 1807 , then abolished slavery in all its colonies with the  Slavery Abolition Act 1833 . During the 1830s, approximately 12 000  Boers  (later known as  Voortrekkers ), departed from the  Cape Colony , where they were subjected to British control, to the future Natal, Orange Free State and Transvaal regions. The Boers founded the  Boer Republics  - the  South African Republic  (Now  Gauteng ,  Limpopo ,  Mpumalanga  and  North West  provinces) and the  Orange Free State  ( Free State ).   The discovery of  diamonds  in 1867 and  gold  in 1884 in the interior encouraged economic growth and immigration, intensifying the subjugation of the indigenous people. These important economic resources did not only play a role between European and the indigenous population but also between the Boers and the British. [ 14 ]   The  Boer Republics  successfully resisted British encroachments during the  First Boer War  (18801881) using  guerrilla warfare  tactics, much better suited to local conditions. However, the British returned in greater numbers, more experience, and more suitable tactics in the  Second Boer War  (18991902). The Boers' attempt to ally themselves with  German South-West Africa  provided the British with yet another excuse to take control of the Boer Republics. [ citation needed ]           Boers  in combat (1881).         Independence   After four years of negotiating, the  Union of South Africa  was created from the  Cape  and  Natal  colonies, as well as the republics of  Orange Free State  and  Transvaal , on 31 May 1910, exactly eight years after the end of the Second Boer War. The newly created Union of South Africa was a  dominion . The  Natives' Land Act  of 1913 severely restricted the ownership of land by 'blacks', at that stage to a mere 7% of the country, although this amount was eventually increased marginally. [ 15 ]  The union was effectively granted independence from the United Kingdom with the passage of the  Statute of Westminster , which morphed the  British king's  position within South Africa into that of the distinct  King of South Africa . In 1934, the  South African Party  and  National Party  merged to form the  United Party , seeking reconciliation between Afrikaners and English-speaking ""Whites"", but split in 1939 over the entry of the Union into  World War II  as an ally of the United Kingdom, a move which the National Party strongly opposed.   In 1948, the  National Party  was elected to power, and intensified the implementation of racial segregation that had begun under Dutch and British colonial rule, and subsequent South African governments since the Union was formed. The Nationalist Government systematised existing segregationist laws, and the system of segregation became known collectively as  apartheid . Not surprisingly, this segregation also applied to the wealth acquired during rapid industrialisation of the 1950s, '60s, and '70s. While the White minority enjoyed the highest  standard of living  in all of Africa, often comparable to  First World  western nations, the Black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard, including income, education, housing, and life expectancy. On 31 May 1961, following a whites-only  referendum , the country became a  republic  and left the (British)  Commonwealth . The office of  Governor-General  was abolished and replaced with the position of  State President .   Apartheid became increasingly controversial, leading to widespread  sanctions ,  divestment  and growing unrest and oppression within South Africa. (See also the article on the  History of South Africa in the apartheid era .) A long period of harsh suppression by the government, and at times violent resistance,  strikes , marches, protests, and  sabotage  by bombing and other means, by various anti-apartheid movements, most notably the  African National Congress  (ANC), followed. In the late 1970s, South Africa began a programme of  nuclear weapons  development and in the following decade it produced six deliverable nuclear weapons. The rationale for the nuclear arsenal is disputed, but it is believed [ who? ]  that  Vorster  and  P.W. Botha  wanted to be able to catalyse American intervention in the event of a war between South Africa and the  Cuban -supported  MPLA  government of  Angola .     Democracy   In 1990 the  National Party  government took the first step towards negotiating itself out of power when it lifted the ban on the  African National Congress  and other  left-wing  political organisations, and released  Nelson Mandela  from prison after twenty-seven years' incarceration on a  sabotage  sentence. Apartheid legislation was gradually removed from the statute books, and South Africa also destroyed its nuclear arsenal and acceded to the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . The first  multi-racial elections  were held in 1994, which the ANC won by an overwhelming majority. It has been in power ever since.   In  post-apartheid South Africa , millions of South Africans, mostly black, continued to live in  poverty , though poverty among whites, previously rare, has increased greatly. [ 16 ]  While some have partly attributed this to the legacy of the apartheid system, increasingly many attribute it to the failure of the current government to tackle social issues, coupled with the monetary and fiscal discipline of the current government to ensure both redistribution of wealth and economic growth. Since the ANC-led government took power, the  United Nations   Human Development Index  of South Africa has fallen, while it was steadily rising until the mid-1990s. [ 17 ]  Some of this could possibly be attributed to the  AIDS   pandemic  and the failure of the government to take steps to address it, [ 18 ] some of it can also be pinpointed to a government policy of  redistribution of wealth . As a mitigating factor, the social housing policy of the current government has produced an improvement in living conditions.     Politics   Main articles:  Politics of South Africa ,  Government of South Africa , and  Law of South Africa          The  Union Buildings  in  Pretoria  is the home of the South African executive.       South Africa has three capital cities:  Cape Town , the largest of the three, is the  legislative  capital;  Pretoria  is the  administrative  capital; and  Bloemfontein  is the  judicial  capital. South Africa has a  bicameral   parliament : the  National Council of Provinces  (the  upper house ) has 90 members, while the  National Assembly  (the  lower house ) has 400 members. Members of the lower house are elected on a population basis by  proportional representation : half of the members are elected from national lists and the other half are elected from provincial lists. Ten members are elected to represent each province in the National Council of Provinces, regardless of the population of the province. Elections for both chambers are held every five years. The government is formed in the lower house, and the leader of the majority party in the National Assembly is the  President .   The primary sources of South Africa law are Roman-Dutch mercantile law and personal law with English Common law, as imports of Dutch settlements and  British colonialism . [ 19 ]  The first European based law in South Africa was brought by the  Dutch East India Company  and is called  Roman-Dutch law . It was imported before the  codification  of European law into the  Napoleonic Code  and is comparable in many ways to  Scots law . This was followed in the 19th century by  English law , both  common  and  statutory . Starting in 1910 with unification, South Africa had its own  parliament  which passed laws specific for South Africa, building on those previously passed for the individual member colonies.   Current South African politics are dominated by the  African National Congress  (ANC), which received 69.7% of the vote during the last  2004 general election  and 66.3% of the vote in the  2006 municipal election . The current  President of South Africa  is  Kgalema Motlanthe , who replaced  Thabo Mbeki  on 25 September 2008. Mbeki succeeded former President  Nelson Mandela  in 1999, and was re-elected for a second five year term in 2004, but announced his resignation on 20 September 2008.   The main challenger to the rule of the ANC is the  Democratic Alliance  party, which received 12.4% of the vote in the 2004 election and 14.8% in the 2006 election.  Helen Zille , (elected 6 May 2007), is the party leader; the previous leader was  Tony Leon . The formerly dominant  New National Party , which introduced apartheid through its predecessor, the  National Party , chose to merge with the ANC on 9 April 2005. Other major political parties represented in Parliament are the  Inkatha Freedom Party , which mainly represents  Zulu  voters, and the  Independent Democrats , who took 6.97% and 1.7% of the vote respectively, in the 2004 election.   Since 2004, the country has had many thousands of popular protests, some violent, making it, according to one academic, the ""most protest-rich country in the world"". [ 20 ]  Many of these protests have been organised from the growing  shanty towns  that surround South African cities.     Foreign relations and military   Main articles:  South African National Defence Force ,  Foreign relations of South Africa , and  South Africa and weapons of mass destruction   Since the end of apartheid, the South African foreign policy has focused on its African partners particularly in the  Southern African Development Community  (SADC) and the  African Union . South Africa has played a key role as a mediator in African conflicts over the last decade, such as in  Burundi , the  Democratic Republic of Congo , the  Comoros , and  Zimbabwe . After apartheid ended, South Africa was readmitted to the  Commonwealth of Nations . As the  Union of South Africa , South Africa was a founding member of the  United Nations  and the then Prime Minister  Jan Smuts  wrote the preamble to its constitution. South Africa is currently a non-permanent member of the  United Nations Security Council  and has attracted controversy by voting against a resolution criticising the  Burmese  government in 2006 and against the implementation of sanctions against  Zimbabwe  in 2008. South Africa is a member of the  Group of 77  and chaired the organisation in 2006. South Africa is a member of the  South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone ,  Southern African Customs Union ,  World Trade Organization ,  International Monetary Fund ,  G20  and  G8+5 .   The South African  armed forces , known as the  South African National Defence Force  (SANDF), was created in 1994. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  Previously known as the  South African Defence Force  (SADF), the new force is an all volunteer army and consists of the forces of the old SADF, as well as the forces of the African nationalist groups, namely  Umkhonto we Sizwe  (MK),  Azanian People's Liberation Army  (APLA), and the former  Bantustan  defence forces. [ 21 ]  The SANDF is subdivided into four branches, the  South African Army , the  South African Air Force , the  South African Navy , and the  South African Military Health Services . [ 23 ]   In recent years, the SANDF has become a major  peacekeeping  force in Africa, [ 24 ]  and has been involved in operations in  Lesotho , the  Democratic Republic of the Congo , [ 24 ]  and  Burundi , [ 24 ]  amongst others. It has also participated as a part of multi-national  UN  peacekeeping forces.   South Africa undertook a nuclear weapons programme in the 1970s [ 25 ]  and  may have conducted  a nuclear test over the  Atlantic  in 1979. [ 26 ]  It is the only African country to have successfully  developed nuclear weapons . It has become the first country (followed by Ukraine) with nuclear capability to voluntarily renounce and dismantle its programme and in the process signed the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty  in 1991. [ 25 ]     Provinces, districts and municipalities   Main articles:  Provinces of South Africa ,  Districts of South Africa , and  Municipalities of South Africa          Map showing the provinces and districts (numbered) of South Africa.             Northern Cape          North West          Gauteng          Limpopo          Mpumalanga            KwaZulu-Natal          Eastern Cape          Free State          Western Cape               When apartheid ended in 1994, the South African government had to integrate the formerly independent and semi-independent  Bantustans  into the political structure of South Africa. To this end, it abolished the four former provinces of South Africa ( Cape Province ,  Natal ,  Orange Free State , and  Transvaal ) and replaced them with nine fully integrated provinces. The new provinces are usually much smaller than the former provinces, which theoretically gives local governments more resources to distribute over smaller areas.   The nine provinces are further subdivided into  52 districts :  6 metropolitan  and  46 district municipalities . The 46 district municipalities are further subdivided into  231 local municipalities . The district municipalities also contain 20 district management areas (mostly game parks) that are directly governed by the district municipalities. The six metropolitan municipalities perform the functions of both district and local municipalities.

At 470,979  sq mi  (1,219,912 km), [ 27 ]  South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world (after  Mali ). It is comparable in size to  Colombia .  Njesuthi  in the  Drakensberg  at 3,408 m (11,424 ft) is the highest peak in South Africa.          View of the  Drakensberg mountains , the highest mountain range in South Africa.       South Africa has a generally  temperate climate , due in part to it being surrounded by the  Atlantic  and  Indian Oceans  on three sides, by its location in the climatically milder  southern hemisphere  and due to the average elevation rising steadily towards the north (towards the  equator ) and further inland. Due to this varied topography and oceanic influence, a great variety of climatic zones exist.   The climatic zones vary, from the extreme  desert  of the southern  Namib  in the farthest northwest to the lush  subtropical  climate in the east along the  Mozambique  border and the  Indian  ocean. From the east, the land quickly rises over a  mountainous   escarpment  towards the interior  plateau  known as the  Highveld . Even though South Africa is classified as  semi-arid , there is considerable variation in  climate  as well as  topography .   The interior of South Africa is a vast, rather flat, and sparsely populated  scrubland ,  Karoo , which is drier towards the northwest along the Namib desert. In contrast, the eastern coastline is lush and well-watered, which produces a climate similar to the tropics. The extreme southwest has a climate remarkably similar to that of the  Mediterranean  with wet winters and hot, dry summers, hosting the famous  Fynbos   Biome . This area also produces much of the  wine  in South Africa. This region is also particularly known for its wind, which blows intermittently almost all year. The severity of this wind made passing around the  Cape of Good Hope  particularly treacherous for sailors, causing many  shipwrecks . Further east on the south coast, rainfall is distributed more evenly throughout the year, producing a green landscape. This area is popularly known as the  Garden Route .          Satellite picture of South Africa       The  Free State  is particularly flat due to the fact that it lies centrally on the high plateau. North of the  Vaal River , the Highveld becomes better watered and does not experience subtropical extremes of heat.  Johannesburg , in the centre of the Highveld, is at 1,740 metres (5,709 ft) and receives an annual rainfall of 760 millimetres (30  in ). Winters in this region are cold, although  snow  is rare.   To the north of Johannesburg, the altitude drops beyond the escarpment of the Highveld, and turns into the lower lying Bushveld, an area of mixed dry forest and an abundance of wildlife. East of the Highveld, beyond the eastern escarpment, the Lowveld stretches towards the  Indian  ocean. It has particularly high temperatures, and is also the location of extended subtropical agriculture.   The high  Drakensberg mountains , which form the south-eastern escarpment of the Highveld, offer limited  skiing  opportunities in winter. The coldest place in South Africa is  Sutherland  in the western  Roggeveld Mountains , where midwinter temperatures can reach as low as 15 degrees  Celsius  (5  F ). The deep interior has the hottest temperatures: A temperature of 51.7 C (125 F) was recorded in 1948 in the  Northern Cape  Kalahari near  Upington . [ 28 ]   South Africa also has one possession, the small sub-Antarctic archipelago of the  Prince Edward Islands , consisting of  Marion Island  (290 km/112 sq mi) and Prince Edward Island (45 km/17.3 sq mi) (not to be confused with the  Canadian province of the same name ).           Weather averages for Cape Town, South Africa         Month   Jan   Feb   Mar   Apr   May   Jun   Jul   Aug   Sep   Oct   Nov   Dec   Year       Average high C (F)   27  (81)   28  (82)   26  (79)   24  (75)   20  (68)   18  (64)   17  (63)   18  (64)   19  (66)   22  (72)   24  (75)   26  (79)   28  (82)       Average low C (F)   16  (61)   16  (61)   15  (59)   13  (55)   10  (50)   8  (46)   8  (46)   8  (46)   9  (48)   11  (52)   14  (57)   15  (59)   8  (46)       Precipitation  mm (inches)   16.5  (0.65)   13  (0.51)   20  (0.79)   54  (2.13)   92  (3.62)   111  (4.37)   96  (3.78)   87  (3.43)   56  (2.2)   40  (1.57)   24  (0.94)   18  (0.71)   627  (24.69)       Source: EuroWEATHER [ 29 ]  2008-02-22         Flora and fauna   See also:  Wildlife of South Africa   See also:  Protected areas of South Africa           Fynbos , a  floral kingdom  unique to South Africa, is found near  Cape Town               Swartberg  mountains near the town of  Oudtshoorn              A field of flowers in Weskus National Park.       South Africa is one of only 17 countries worldwide considered  megadiverse . It has more than 20,000 different  plants , or about 10% of all the known  species  of plants on  Earth , making it particularly rich in plant biodiversity. South Africa is the 6th most biodiverse country, [ 30 ]  after  Brazil ,  Colombia ,  Indonesia ,  China , and  Mexico . The most prevalent biome in South Africa is the  grassland , particularly on the  Highveld , where the plant cover is dominated by different  grasses , low  shrubs , and  acacia trees , mainly camel-thorn and whitethorn.  Vegetation  becomes even more sparse towards the northwest due to low  rainfall . There are several species of water-storing  succulents  like  aloes  and euphorbias in the very hot and dry  Namaqualand  area. The grass and thorn  savannah  turns slowly into a bush savannah towards the north-east of the country, with denser growth. There are significant numbers of  baobab  trees in this area, near the northern end of  Kruger National Park . [ 31 ]   The  Fynbos   Biome , which makes up the majority of the area and plant life in the  Cape floristic region , one of the six  floral kingdoms , is located in a small region of the  Western Cape  and contains more than 9,000 of those species, making it among the richest regions on earth in terms of floral biodiversity. The majority of the plants are  evergreen  hard-leaf plants with fine, needle-like  leaves , such as the  sclerophyllous  plants. Another uniquely South African plant is the  protea  genus of flowering plants. There are around 130 different species of protea in South Africa.   While South Africa has a great wealth of flowering plants, it has few  forests . Only 1% of South Africa is forest, almost exclusively in the  humid   coastal plain  along the  Indian Ocean  in  KwaZulu-Natal  (see  KwaZulu-Cape coastal forest mosaic ). There are even smaller reserves of forests that are out of the reach of  fire , known as montane forests (see  Knysna-Amatole montane forests ).  Plantations  of imported tree species are predominant, particularly the non-native  eucalyptus  and  pine . South Africa has lost a large area of natural habitat in the last four decades, primarily due to  overpopulation , sprawling development patterns and  deforestation  during the nineteenth century. South Africa is one of the worst affected countries in the world when it comes to invasion by alien species with many (e.g.  Black Wattle ,  Port Jackson ,  Hakea ,  Lantana  and  Jacaranda ) posing a significant threat to the native  biodiversity  and the already scarce water resources. The original  temperate forest  that met the first European settlers to South Africa was exploited ruthlessly until only small patches remained. Currently, South African  hardwood  trees like  Real Yellowwood   (Podocarpus latifolius) ,  stinkwood   (Ocotea bullata) , and South African  Black Ironwood   (Olea laurifolia)  are under government protection.   Numerous  mammals  are found in the  bushveld  habitats including  lions ,  leopards ,  white rhinos ,  blue wildebeest ,  kudus ,  impalas ,  hyenas ,  hippopotamus  and  giraffes . A significant extent of the bushveld habitat exists in the north-east including  Kruger National Park  and the  Mala Mala  Reserve, as well as in the far north in the  Waterberg Biosphere .   Climate change is expected to bring considerable warming and drying to much of this already semi-arid region, with greater frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, flooding and drought. According to computer generated climate modelling produced by the South African National Biodiversity Institute [ 32 ]  parts of southern Africa will see an increase in temperature by about one degree Celsius along the coast to more than four degrees Celsius in the already hot hinterland such as the  Northern Cape  in late spring and summertime by 2050.   The Cape Floral Kingdom has been identified as one of the global  biodiversity hotspots  since it will be hit very hard by  climate change  and has such a great diversity of life. Drought, increased intensity and frequency of fire and climbing temperatures are expected to push many of these  rare species  towards  extinction .   South Africa houses many endemic species, among them the  critically endangered   Riverine Rabbit  ( Bunolagus monticullaris ) in the  Karoo .     Economy   Main article:  Economy of South Africa          The  Victoria & Alfred Waterfront  in  Cape Town  with  Table Mountain  in the background. Cape Town has become an important  retail  and  tourism  centre for the country, and attracts the largest number of foreign visitors in South Africa       By  UN  classification South Africa is a middle-income country with an abundant supply of resources, well-developed financial, legal, communications, energy, and transport sectors, a  stock exchange  (the  JSE Limited ), that ranks among the top twenty in the world, and a modern infrastructure supporting an efficient distribution of goods to major urban centres throughout the entire region. South Africa is ranked 25th in the world in terms of  GDP  (PPP) as of 2007.   Advanced development is significantly localised around four areas: Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Durban, and Pretoria/Johannesburg. Beyond these four economic centres, development is marginal and poverty is still prevalent despite government efforts. Consequently the vast majority of South Africans are poor. However, key marginal areas have experienced rapid growth recently. Such areas include Mossel Bay to Plettenberg Bay; Rustenburg area; Nelspruit area; Bloemfontein; Cape West Coast; and the KwaZulu-Natal North Coast.   Even though South Africa has the seventh highest per capita income in Africa, only behind  Libya ,  Mauritius  it suffers from large income gaps and a  dual economy  marking it as a  developing country . South Africa has one of the highest rates of  income inequality  in the world. A decade of continual economic growth has helped to lower unemployment, but daunting economic and social problems remain. The average South African household income decreased considerably between 1995 and 2000. As for racial inequality,  Statistics South Africa  reported that in 1995 the average white household earned four times as much as the average black household. In 2000 the average white household was earning six times more than the average black household. [ 33 ]  The  affirmative action  policies have seen a rise in black economic wealth and an emerging black middle class. [ 34 ]  Other problems are crime, corruption, and  HIV / AIDS .   At the start of 2000, then President Thabo Mbeki vowed to promote economic growth and foreign investment by relaxing restrictive labour laws, stepping up the pace of  privatisation , and cutting unneeded governmental spending. His policies face strong opposition from organised  labour . South Africa is also the largest energy producer and consumer on the continent. South Africa is a popular tourist destination, and a substantial amount of revenue comes from tourism. [ 35 ]  Among the main attractions are the diverse and picturesque culture, the game reserves and the highly regarded local wines.   The South African  rand  (ZAR), is the most actively traded emerging  market currency  in the world. It has joined an elite club of fifteen currencies, the  Continuous linked settlement  (CLS), where forex transactions are settled immediately, lowering the risks of transacting across  time zones . The rand was the best-performing currency against the  United States dollar  (USD) between 2002 and 2005, according to the  Bloomberg  Currency Scorecard.   The volatility of the  rand  has affected economic activity, falling sharply during 2001 and hitting a historic low of 13.85  ZAR  to the  USD , raising fears of inflation, and causing the Reserve Bank to increase  interest rates . The rand has since recovered, trading at 7.13 ZAR to the dollar as of January 2008. However, as exporters are put under considerable pressure from a stronger domestic currency, many call for government intervention to help soften the rand.   Refugees from poorer neighbouring countries include many immigrants from the DRC, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Malawi and others, representing a large portion of the informal sector. With high unemployment levels amongst poorer South Africans,  xenophobia  is prevalent and many people born in South Africa feel resentful of immigrants who are seen to be depriving the native population of jobs, a feeling which has been given credibility by the fact that many South African employers have employed migrants from other countries for lower pay than South African citizens, especially in the  construction ,  tourism ,  agriculture  and  domestic service  industries. Illegal immigrants are also heavily involved in informal trading. [ 36 ]  However, many immigrants to South Africa continue to live in poor conditions, and the South African immigration policy has become increasingly restrictive since 1994. [ 37 ]   Principal international trading partners of South Africa  besides other African countries  include  Germany , the  United States ,  China ,  Japan , the  United Kingdom  and  Spain .  [ 38 ]  Chief exports include  corn ,  diamonds ,  fruits ,  gold ,  metals  and  minerals ,  sugar , and  wool .  Machinery  and transportation equipment make up more than one-third of the value of the countrys imports. Other imports include  chemicals , manufactured goods, and  petroleum .     Electricity crisis   After unsuccessful attempts by the government to encourage private construction of electricity generation capacity, in 2007 the state-owned electricity supplier ( Eskom ) started experiencing a lack of capacity in the electrical generating and reticulation infrastructure. This led to an inability to meet the routine demands of industry and consumers, resulting in countrywide  rolling blackouts . Initially the lack of capacity was triggered by a failure at  Koeberg nuclear power station , but since then a general lack of capacity became evident. The supplier has been widely criticised for failing to adequately plan for and construct sufficient electrical generating capacity, [ 39 ]  although ultimately the government has admitted that it is at fault for refusing to approve funding for investment in infrastructure. [ 40 ]     Agriculture          Workers planting on a farm in the central area of  Mpumalanga .               Farm  workers.       South Africa has a large agricultural sector and is a net exporter of  farming  products. There are almost a thousand  agricultural cooperatives  and  agribusinesses  throughout the country, and agricultural exports have constituted 8% of South African total exports for the past five years. The agricultural industry contributes around 10% of formal employment, relatively low compared to other parts of Africa, as well as providing work for casual labourers and contributing around 2.6% of  GDP  for the nation. [ 41 ]  However, due to the  aridity  of the land, only 13.5% can be used for crop production, and only 3% is considered high potential land. [ 42 ]   Although the commercial farming sector is relatively well developed, people in some rural areas still survive on  subsistence agriculture . It is the eighth largest wine producer in the world, and the eleventh largest producer of sunflower seed. South Africa is a net exporter of agricultural products and foodstuffs, the largest number of exported items being  sugar ,  grapes ,  citrus ,  nectarines ,  wine  and  deciduous  fruit. The largest locally produced crop is  maize  (corn), and it has been estimated that 9 million tons are produced every year, with 7.4 million tons being consumed.  Livestock  are also popular on South African farms, with the country producing 85% of all meat consumed. The dairy industry consists of around 4,300 milk producers providing employment for 60,000 farm workers and contributing to the livelihoods of around 40,000 others. [ 43 ]   In recent years, the agricultural sector has introduced several reforms, some of which are controversial, such as  land reform  and the deregulation of the market for agricultural products. Land reform has been criticised both by farmers' groups and by landless workers, the latter alleging that the pace of change has not been fast enough, and the former alleging racist treatment and expressing concerns that a similar situation to  Zimbabwe's land reform policy  may develop, [ 44 ]  a fear exacerbated by comments made by  deputy president , the deputy president of South Africa. [ 45 ] [ 46 ]  The sector continues to face problems, with increased foreign competition and crime being two of the major challenges for the industry. The government has been accused of either putting in too much effort [ 47 ] , or not enough effort [ 48 ] , to tackle the problem of  farm attacks  as opposed to other forms of violent crime.   Another issue which affects South African agriculture is environmental damage caused by misuse of the land and global climate change. South Africa is unusually vulnerable to climate change and resultant diminution of surface waters. Some predictions show surface water supply could decrease by 60% by the year 2070 in parts of the Western Cape. [ 49 ]  To reverse the damage caused by land mismanagement, the government has supported a scheme which promotes  sustainable development  and the use of natural resources. [ 50 ]  Maize production, which contributes to a 36% majority of the gross value of South Africas field crops, has also experienced negative effects due to climate change. The estimated value of loss, which takes into consideration scenarios with and without the carbon dioxide fertilisation effect  [2]  ,ranges between 10s to 100s of millions of Rands.

South Africa is a nation of more than 48 million people of diverse origins,  cultures ,  languages , and  religions . The last  census  was held in 2001 and the next will be in 2011.  Statistics South Africa  provided five  racial  categories by which people could classify themselves, the last of which, ""unspecified/other"" drew negligible responses, and these results were omitted. [ 52 ]  The 2006 midyear estimated figures for the other categories were  Black African  at 79.5%,  White  at 9.2%,  Coloured  at 8.9%, and  Indian or Asian  at 2.5%. [ 53 ]  Even though the population of South Africa has increased in the past decade [ 52 ] [ 54 ]  (primarily due to immigration), the country had an annual population growth rate of 0.501% in 2008 (CIA est.), including immigration. [ 55 ]  South Africa is home to an estimated 5 million  illegal immigrants , including some 3 million  Zimbabweans . [ 56 ] [ 57 ] [ 58 ]  A series of  anti-immigrant riots  occurred in South Africa beginning on 11 May 2008. [ 59 ] [ 60 ]   By far the major part of the population classified itself as African or black, but it is not culturally or linguistically homogeneous. Major ethnic groups include the  Zulu ,  Xhosa ,  Basotho  (South Sotho),  Bapedi  (North Sotho),  Venda ,  Tswana ,  Tsonga ,  Swazi  and  Ndebele , all of which speak  Bantu languages  (see  Bantu peoples of South Africa ).   Some, such as the Zulu, Xhosa, Bapedi and Venda groups, are unique to South Africa. Other groups are distributed across the borders with neighbours of South Africa: The  Basotho  group is also the major ethnic group in  Lesotho . The  Tswana  ethnic group constitute the majority of the population of  Botswana . The  Swazi  ethnic group is the major ethnic group in  Swaziland . The  Ndebele  ethnic group is also found in  Matabeleland  in  Zimbabwe , where they are known as the  Matabele . These Ndebele people are the descendants of a Zulu faction under the warrior  Mzilikazi  that escaped persecution from  Shaka  by migrating to their current territory. The  Tsonga  ethnic group is also found in southern  Mozambique , where they are known as the Shangaan.   The white population is not ethnically homogeneous and descend from many ethnic groups:  Dutch ,  Flemish ,  Portuguese , German, French  Huguenot , English, Irish, Italian, Scottish and  Welsh . Culturally and linguistically, they are divided into the  Afrikaners , who speak  Afrikaans , and English-speaking groups, many of whom are descended from British and Irish immigrants (see  Anglo-African ). Many small communities that have immigrated over the last century retain the use of other languages. The  white population  is on the decrease due to a low birth rate and emigration; as a factor in their decision to emigrate, many cite the high  crime  rate and the  affirmative action  policies of the government. Since 1994, approximately 1 000 000 white South Africans have permanently emigrated. [ 61 ] [ 62 ] [ 63 ] [ 64 ]  Despite high emigration levels, a high level of non-South African white immigrants have settled in the country, in particular from countries such as  Britain  and  Zimbabwe . For example, by 2005, an estimated 212 000 British citizens were residing in South Africa. Since 2003, the numbers of British migrants coming to South Africa has risen by 50%. An estimated 20 000 British migrants moved to South Africa in 2007. There have also been a significant number of  white Zimbabwean  arrivals, fleeing their home country in light of the economic and political problems currently facing the country. As well as recent arrivals, a significant number of white Zimbabweans emigrated to South Africa in the wake of independence in Zimbabwe in 1980. Some of the more nostalgic members of the community are known in popular culture as "" Whenwes "", because of their nostalgia for their lives in  Rhodesia  ""when we were in Rhodesia"". [ 65 ]   The term  Coloured  is still largely used for the people of mixed race descended from slaves brought in from East and Central Africa, the indigenous  Khoisan  who lived in the  Cape  at the time, Bantus, Whites (mostly the  Dutch / Afrikaner  and British settlers) as well as an admixture of  Javanese ,  Malay , Indian,  Malagasy  and Asian blood (such as  Burmese ). The majority speak Afrikaans. Khoisan is a term used to describe two separate groups, physically similar: light-skinned and small in stature. The  Khoikhoi , who were called  Hottentots  by the Europeans, were pastoralists and were annihilated; the San, called  Bushmen  by the Europeans, were hunter-gatherers. Within the Coloured community, more recent immigrants will also be found: Coloureds from the former  Rhodesia  (now  Zimbabwe );  Namibia  and immigrants of mixed descent from India and  Burma  ( Anglo-Indians / Anglo-Burmese ) who were welcomed to the Cape when India and Burma received their Independence.   The major part of the South African  Asian  population is Indian in origin (see  Indian South Africans ); many of them descended from indentured workers brought in the nineteenth century to work on the  sugar   plantations  of the eastern coastal area then known as  Natal . There is also a significant group of  Chinese South Africans  (approximately 100,000 individuals) and  Vietnamese  South Africans (approximately 50,000 individuals). In 2008, the Pretoria High Court has ruled that Chinese South Africans who arrived before 1994 are to be reclassified as  Coloureds . As a result of this ruling, about 12,000 - 15,000  [ 66 ] ethnically Chinese citizens who arrived before 1994, numbering 3%-5% of the total Chinese population in the country, will be able to benefit from government  BEE  policies. [ 67 ]   South Africa hosts a sizeable refugee and asylum seeker population. According to the  World Refugee Survey 2008 , published by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, this population numbered approximately 144,700 in 2007. [ 68 ]  Groups of refugees and asylum seekers numbering over 10,000 included people from  Zimbabwe  (48,400), The  Democratic Republic of the Congo  (24,800), and  Somalia  (12,900). [ 68 ]  These populations mainly lived in Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban, Cape Town, and Port Elizabeth. [ 68 ]     Science and technology   Several important scientific and technological developments have originated in South Africa.  The first human to human heart transplant was performed by cardiac surgeon  Christiaan Barnard  at  Groote Schuur Hospital  in December 1967  .  Max Theiler  developed a vaccine against Yellow Fever,  Allan McLeod Cormack  pioneered x-ray  Computed tomography , and  Aaron Klug  developed crystallographic electron microscopy techniques. These advancements were all recognised with  Nobel Prizes .  Sydney Brenner  won most recently, in 2002, for his pioneering work in  molecular biology .   Mark Shuttleworth  founded an early Internet security company  Thawte , that was subsequently bought out by world-leader  VeriSign . Despite government efforts to encourage entrepreneurship in biotechnology, IT and other high technology fields, no other notable groundbreaking companies have been founded in South Africa. However, it is the expressed objective of the government to transition the economy to be more reliant on high technology, based on the realisation that South African cannot compete with Far Eastern economies in manufacturing, nor can the republic rely on its mineral wealth in perpetuity.   South Africa has cultivated a burgeoning astronomy community. It hosts the  Southern African Large Telescope , the largest optical telescope in the southern hemisphere. South Africa is currently building the  Karoo Array Telescope  as a pathfinder for the $20 billion  Square Kilometer Array  project. South Africa is a finalist, with Australia, to be the host of the SKA.     Society and culture   Main article:  Culture of South Africa          Decorated houses,  Drakensberg Mountains              Traditional  South African cuisine .       It may be argued that there is no ""single"" culture in South Africa because of its ethnic diversity. Today, the diversity in foods from many cultures is enjoyed by all and especially marketed to tourists who wish to sample the large variety of South African cuisine. In addition to  food ,  music  and  dance  feature prominently.   South African cuisine  is heavily  meat-based  and has spawned the distinctively South African social gathering known as a  braai , or barbecue. South Africa has also developed into a major  wine  producer, with some of the best  vineyards  lying in valleys around  Stellenbosch ,  Franschoek ,  Paarl  and  Barrydale . [ 69 ]   There is great diversity in music from South Africa. Many black musicians who sang in Afrikaans or English during apartheid have since begun to sing in traditional African languages, and have developed a unique style called  Kwaito . Of note is  Brenda Fassie , who launched to fame with her song ""Weekend Special"", which was sung in English. More famous traditional musicians include  Ladysmith Black Mambazo , while the  Soweto String Quartet  performs classic music with an African flavour. White and Coloured South African singers are historically influenced by European musical styles including such western metal bands such as  Seether  (formerly Saron Gas). South Africa has produced world-famous jazz musicians, notably  Hugh Masekela ,  Jonas Gwangwa ,  Abdullah Ibrahim ,  Miriam Makeba ,  Jonathan Butler ,  Chris McGregor , and  Sathima Bea Benjamin .  Afrikaans  music covers multiple genres, such as the  contemporary   Steve Hofmeyr  and the  punk rock  band  Fokofpolisiekar . Crossover artists such as  Johnny Clegg  and his bands  Juluka  and  Savuka  have enjoyed various success underground, publicly, and abroad.   The South African black majority still has a substantial number of rural inhabitants who lead largely impoverished lives. It is among these people, however, that cultural traditions survive most strongly; as blacks have become increasingly  urbanised  and  westernised , aspects of traditional culture have declined. Urban blacks usually speak English or  Afrikaans  in addition to their native tongue. There are smaller but still significant groups of speakers of  Khoisan languages  who are not included in the eleven official languages, but are one of the eight other officially recognised languages. There are small groups of speakers of  endangered languages , most of which are from the Khoi-San family, that receive no official status; however, some groups within South Africa are attempting to promote their use and revival.   The  middle class  lifestyle, predominantly of the white minority but with growing numbers of Black, Coloured and Indian people, [ 70 ]  is similar in many respects to that of people found in  Western Europe , North America and  Australasia . Members of the middle class often study and work abroad for greater exposure to the markets of the world.   Asians , predominantly of Indian origin, preserve their own cultural heritage, languages and religious beliefs, being either  Christian ,  Hindu  or  Sunni Muslim  and speaking English, with Indian languages like  Hindi ,  Telugu ,  Tamil  or  Gujarati  being spoken less frequently, but the majority of Indians being able to understand their mother tongue. The first Indians arrived on the famous  Truro ship  as  indentured labourers  in Natal to work the Sugar Cane Fields. There is a much smaller  Chinese  community in South Africa, although its numbers have increased due to immigration from  Republic of China  (Taiwan).   South Africa has also had a large influence in the  Scouting  movement, with many Scouting traditions and ceremonies coming from the experiences of  Robert Baden-Powell  (the founder of Scouting) during his time in South Africa as a military officer in the 1890s. The  South African Scout Association  was one of the first youth organisations to open its doors to youth and adults of all races in South Africa. This happened on 2 July 1977 at a conference known as  Quo Vadis . [ 71 ]   The South African music scene consists of  Kwaito , a new music genre that had developed in the mid 80s and has since developed to become the most popular social economical form of representation among the populous. Though some may argue that the political aspects of Kwaito has since diminished after  Apartheid , and the relative interest in politics has become a minor aspect of daily life. Some argue that in a sense,  Kwaito  is in fact a political force that shows activism in its apolitical actions. Today, major corporations like  Sony ,  BMG , and  EMI  have appeared on the South African scene to produce and distribute  Kwaito  music. Due to its overwhelming popularity, as well as the general influence of DJs, who are among the top 5 most influential types of people within the country,  Kwaito  has taken over radio, television, and magazines. [ 72 ]   Kwaito , much like most hip-hop has its own local flavor and originality. However, unlike when hip-hop first burst on the scene as a politically driven and rebellious underground movement, South Africans wanted to create a happier vibe. As the post-apartheid fog cleared, South African youth found their ""own voice in a style of music known as kwaito, spawning a new (and profitable) industry"". [ 73 ]  According to TIMEeurope magazine, ""The kwaito sound now regularly incorporates traditional African music, jazz, gospel, and even rock guitar, most notably on Mandoza's 2000 hit Nkalakatha, one of the few kwaito records to cross over onto traditionally white radio"". [ 74 ]  In the kwaito, the samples from old school  Jamaican dancehall , European house, etc.,  tempos  are changed, beats are added, and urban street slang is also incorporated. This local flavour of music more recently has been attacked for its lack of ingenuity and its betrayal of its roots. The melodies and the incorporation of sex and dance have since become very similar to the American standard. In addition Kwaito has been criticised for its absence of influential lyrical content. As Kwaito is still a developing genre, and since the South African population is only around 48 million, sales of only 25,000 CDs are required for ""gold"" certification in South Africa. [ 73 ]     Religion   Main article:  Religion in South Africa           St. Mark 's Anglican Cathedral.       According to the latest 2001 national census, Christians accounted for 79.7% of the population. This includes  Zion Christian  11.1%,  Pentecostal  ( Charismatic ) 8.2%,  Roman Catholic  7.1%,  Methodist  6.8%,  Dutch Reformed  6.7%,  Anglican  3.8%, and other Christian 36%.  Islam  accounted for 1.5% of the population,  Hinduism  about 1.3%, and  Judaism  0.2%. 15.1% had no religious affiliation, 2.3% were other and 1.4% were unspecified. [ 75 ] [ 76 ]   African Indigenous Churches were the largest of the  Christian  groups. It was believed that many of these persons who claimed no affiliation with any organised religion adhered to  traditional indigenous religions . Many peoples have  syncretic  religious practices combining Christian and indigenous influences. [ 77 ]   Islam in South Africa  itself is not known to pre-date the colonial period, despite the isolated contact neighbouring  Mozambique  had with  Arab  and  East African  traders. [ citation needed ]  There is no evidence that Islam was known to the  Zulu ,  Swazi , or  Xhosa  of the east coast prior to the colonial era. Many South African Muslims are described as  Coloureds , notably in the  Western Cape , especially those whose ancestors came as slaves from the Indonesian archipelago (the  Cape Malays ). Others are described as  Indians , notably in  KwaZulu-Natal , including those whose ancestors came as traders from  South Asia ; they have been joined by others from other parts of Africa as well as white or black South African converts. It is estimated that  Islam  is the fastest growing religion of conversion in the country, [ 78 ]  with the number of black  Muslims  growing sixfold, from 12,000 in 1991 to 74,700 in 2004. [ 79 ]   Hinduism  dates back to British Colonial period primarily but later waves of continuous immigrants from India have contributed to a sizeable Hindu population. Most Hindus are ethnically South Asian but there are many who come from mixed racial stock and many are converts with the efforts of Hindu missionaries such as ISKCON. Other religions in smaller numbers are  Sikhism ,  Jainism  and  Bah' Faith . [ 76 ]     Languages   Main article:  Languages of South Africa          Map showing principal South African languages by municipality. Lighter shades indicate a non-majority  plurality .             Afrikaans          Northern Sotho          Southern Sotho          Swati          Tsonga            Tswana          Venda          Xhosa          Zulu               South Africa has eleven  official languages : [ 80 ]   Sepedi ,  Sesotho ,  Setswana ,  siSwati ,  Tshivenda ,  Xitsonga ,  Afrikaans ,  English ,  isiNdebele ,  isiXhosa  and  isiZulu . In this regard it is  second only to India  in number. While each language is formally equal to every other, some languages are spoken more than others. According to the 2001 National Census, the three most spoken first home languages are Zulu (23.8%), Xhosa (17.6%) and Afrikaans (13.3%). [ 52 ]  Despite the fact that English is recognised as the language of commerce and science, it was spoken by only 8.2% of South Africans at home in 2001, an even lower percentage than in 1996 (8.6%). [ 52 ]   There are  eleven official names  for South Africa, one in each of the official national languages. The country also recognises eight non-official languages:  Fanagalo ,  Khoe ,  Lobedu ,  Nama ,  Northern Ndebele ,  Phuthi ,  San  and  South African Sign Language . [ citation needed ]  These non-official languages may be used in certain official uses in limited areas where it has been determined that these languages are prevalent. Nevertheless, their populations are not such that they require nationwide recognition.   Many of the ""unofficial languages"" of the  San  and  Khoikhoi  people contain regional  dialects  stretching northward into Namibia and Botswana, and elsewhere. These people, who are a physically distinct population from other Africans, have their own cultural identity based on their  hunter-gatherer  societies. They have been marginalised to a great extent, and many of their languages are in danger of becoming  extinct .   Many white South Africans also speak other European languages, such as  Portuguese  (also spoken by Angolan and Mozambican blacks), German, and  Greek , while some  Asians  and  Indians  in South Africa speak  South Asian  languages, such as  Tamil ,  Hindi ,  Gujarati ,  Urdu  and  Telugu .  French  is still widely spoken by French South Africans especially in places like  Franschhoek , where many South Africans are of French origin. South African French is spoken by less than 10,000 individuals. Congolese French is also spoken in South Africa by migrants.

Unverifiable  material may be challenged and removed.  (June 2008)       The main sports in South Africa are  soccer ,  rugby ,  cricket ,  boxing  and  lawn bowls . Other sports with significant support are  swimming ,  golf  and  netball .  Basketball ,  surfing  and  skateboarding  are popular among the youth.   Famous boxing personalities include Baby Jake  Jacob Matlala ,  Vuyani Bungu ,  Welcome Ncita ,  Dingaan Thobela ,  Gerrie Coetzee  and  Brian Mitchell . Football players who have excelled in international clubs include  Lucas Radebe  of  Leeds United  and  Quinton Fortune , formerly of  Manchester United ,  Benni McCarthy  and  Aaron Mokoena  of  Blackburn Rovers  and  Steven Pienaar  of  Everton . South Africa produced  Formula 1  motor racing's 1979 world champion  Jody Scheckter .   South Africa hosted and won the  1995 Rugby World Cup  at their first attempt and again won the  2007 Rugby World Cup  in  France . South Africa was only allowed to participate from 1995 since the end of  Apartheid . It followed the 1995 Rugby World Cup by hosting and winning the  1996 African Cup of Nations  football tournament. It also hosted the  2003 Cricket World Cup  and the  2007 World Twenty20 Championship . South Africa will be the host nation for the  2010 FIFA World Cup , which will be the first time the tournament is held on the African continent.   In 2004, the swim team of  Roland Schoeman ,  Lyndon Ferns ,  Darian Townsend  and  Ryk Neethling  won the gold medal at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, simultaneously breaking the world record in the 4x100 freestyle relay.  Penny Heyns  won Olympic Gold in the 1996  Atlanta Olympic Games .   In golf,  Gary Player  is generally regarded as one of the greatest golfers of all time, having won the  Career Grand Slam , one of five golfers to have done so. Other South African golfers to have successfully won a major tournament include  Bobby Locke ,  Ernie Els ,  Retief Goosen  and  Trevor Immelman .     Current issues     HIV/AIDS   Main article:  HIV/AIDS in South Africa   The spread of  AIDS  (acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome) is an alarming problem in South Africa with up to 31% of pregnant women found to be HIV infected in 2005 and the infection rate among adults estimated at 20%. [ 81 ]  The link between HIV, a virus spread primarily by sexual contact, and AIDS was long denied by prior president  Thabo Mbeki  and then health minister  Manto Tshabalala-Msimang , who insisted that the many deaths in the country are due to malnutrition, and hence poverty, and not HIV. [ 82 ]  In 2007, in response to international pressure, the government made efforts to fight AIDS. [ 83 ]  In September 2008 Thabo Mbeki was ousted by the ANC and  Kgalema Motlanthe  was appointed for the interim. One of Mr. Motlanthe's first actions was to replace Mrs. Tshabalala-Msimang with the current minister,  Barbara Hogan .   AIDS affects mainly those who are sexually active and is far more prevalent in the black population. Most deaths are people who are also economically active, resulting in many families losing their primary wage earners. This has resulted in many 'AIDS orphans' who in many cases depend on the state for care and financial support. [ 84 ]  It is estimated that there are 1,200,000 orphans in South Africa. [ 84 ]  Many elderly people also lose the support from lost younger members of their family. Roughly 5 million people are infected with the disease. [ 83 ]     Crime   Main article:  Crime in South Africa           Prison  buildings on  Robben Island       According to a survey for the period 19982000 compiled by the  United Nations , South Africa was ranked second for  murder  and first for  assaults  and  rapes  per capita. [ 85 ]  Total crime per capita is 10th out of the 60 countries in the data set.   Crime  has had a pronounced effect on society: many middle-class South Africans moved into  gated communities , abandoning the central business districts of some cities for the relative security of suburbs. This effect is most pronounced in  Johannesburg , although the trend is noticeable in other cities as well. [ citation needed ]  Many emigrants from South Africa also state that crime was a big motivator for them to leave.  Crime against the farming community  has continued to be a major problem. [ 86 ]     Skills migration   Along with many African nations, South Africa has been experiencing a "" brain drain "" in the past 20 years. This is believed to be potentially damaging for the regional economy, [ 87 ]  and is almost certainly detrimental for the well-being of the majority of people reliant on the healthcare infrastructure, given the HIV/AIDS epidemic. [ 88 ]  The skills drain in South Africa tends to demonstrate racial contours (naturally given the skills distribution legacy of South Africa) and has thus resulted in large white South African communities abroad. [ 89 ]     Xenophobia   Main article:  Xenophobia in South Africa   In May 2008 long standing state hostility to African migrants exploded in a series of pogroms that left up to 100 people dead and 100,000 displaced.

Located at roughly 13 North of the  equator  and 59 West of the  prime meridian , it is considered a part of the  Lesser Antilles . Its closest island neighbours are  Saint Vincent & the Grenadines  and  Saint Lucia  to the west. To the south lies  Trinidad and Tobago with which Barbados now shares a fixed official maritime boundaryand also the  South American  mainland. Barbados's total land area is about 430 square kilometres (166 square miles), and is primarily low-lying, with some higher in the country's interior. The highest point in Barbados is  Mount Hillaby  in the parish of Saint Andrew. The geological composition of Barbados is of non-volcanic origin and is predominantly composed of  limestone - coral  formed by subduction of the South American plate colliding with the Caribbean plate. The island's climate is  tropical , with constant  trade winds  off the Atlantic Ocean serving to keep temperatures mild. Some less developed areas of the country contain tropical woodland and  mangroves . Other parts of the interior which contribute to the agriculture industry are dotted with large  sugarcane  estates and wide, gently sloping  pastures , with panoramic views down to the coast also.   Barbados's  human development index  ranking is consistently among the top 75 countries in the world. For example, in 2006, it was ranked 31st in the world, and third in the Americas, behind  Canada  and the  United States .

The origin of the name ""Barbados"" is controversial. The  Portuguese , en route to  Brazil  are credited as the first Europeans to discover and name the island. It is a matter of conjecture whether the word ""bearded"" refers to the long, hanging roots of the bearded fig-tree ( Ficus citrifolia ), indigenous to the island, to bearded  Caribs  inhabiting the island, or to the foam spraying over the outlying reefs giving the impression of a beard. In 1519, a map produced by the Genoese mapmaker  Visconte Maggiolo  showed and named Barbados in its correct position southeast of the island of  Dominica .   Another name associated with Barbados or her people is ""Bim"" or ""Bimshire"". The origin is uncertain but several theories abound, the  National Cultural Foundation  of Barbados follows the Dr.  Richard Allsopp  theory, which is that ""Bim"" was a word commonly used by slaves and that it derives from the phrase ""bi mu"" [ 3 ]  or either (""bem"", ""Ndi bem"", ""Nwanyi ibem"" or ""Nwoke ibem"") [ 4 ]  from an  Igbo  phrase, meaning ""my people."" In colloquial or literary contexts, ""Bim"" can also take a more deific tone, referring to the ""goddess"" Barbados. [ citation needed ]  The word Bim and Bimshire are recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary and the Chamber's Twentieth Century Dictionaries. Another possible source for ""Bim"" is reported to be in the Agricultural Reporter of 25 April 1868, The Rev. N Greenidge (father of one of the island's most famous scholars, Abel Hendy Jones Greenidge) suggested the listing of Bimshire as a county of England. Expressly named were ""Wiltshire, Hampshire, Berkshire, and Bimshire"". [ 5 ]  Lastly in the Daily Argosy (of Demerara i.e. Guyana) of 1652 it referred to Bim as a possible corruption of the word "" Byam "", who was a Royalist leader against the Parliamentarians. That source suggested the followers of Byam became known as Bims and became a word for all Barbadians. [ 6 ]     [ edit ]   Early history   The first indigenous people are thought to be  Amerindians  who arrived from  Venezuela  around approximately 350-400 B.C. The  Arawak  people were the second wave of migrants, arriving from South America around 800. In the thirteenth century, the Caribs arrived from South America in the third wave, displacing both the Arawak and the Salodoid-Barrancoid culture. For the next few centuries, the Caribs  like the Arawak and the Salodoid-Barrancoid  lived in isolation on the island.   The  Portuguese  then briefly claimed Barbados from the mid-1500s to the 1600s; and may have seized the indigenous  Caribs  on Barbados and used them as  slave labour . Other Caribs are believed to have fled the island to neighbouring islands. Apart from possibly displacing the Caribs, the Portuguese left little impact and by the 1610s, they left for South America, leaving the island uninhabited.     [ edit ]   British colonial rule   British sailors who landed on Barbados in 1625 arrived at the site of present-day  Holetown . From the arrival of the first British settlers in 16271628 until independence in 1966, Barbados was under uninterrupted British control. Nevertheless, Barbados always enjoyed a large measure of local autonomy. Its  House of Assembly  began meeting in 1639. Among the initial important British figures was Sir  William Courten .   With the increased implementation of slave codes, which created differential treatment between Africans and the white workers and planters, the island became increasingly unattractive to  poor whites . Black or slave codes were implemented in 1661, 1676, 1682, and 1688. In response to these codes, several slave rebellions were attempted or planned during this time, but none succeeded. However, an increasingly repressive legal system caused the gap between the treatment of typically white indentured servants and black slaves to widen. Imported slaves became much more attractive for the rich planters who would increasingly dominate the island not only economically but also politically. Some have speculated that, because the Africans could withstand tropical diseases and the climate much better than the white slave population, the white population decreased. This is inconsistent with the fact that many poor whites simply migrated to neighbouring islands and remained in tropical climates. Nevertheless, poor whites who had or acquired the means to emigrate often did so. Planters expanded their importation of African slaves to cultivate sugar cane. The Barbados turned from mainly English and Scots-Irish in the seventeenth century to overwhelmingly black by the end of the 18th century.   Barbados eventually had one of the world's biggest sugar industries after Jews from Brazil introduced the sugarcane to the island in the mid 1600s. This quickly replaced  tobacco  plantations on the islands which were previously the main export. As the  sugar  industry developed into its main commercial enterprise, Barbados was divided into large plantation estates that replaced the smallholdings of the early British settlers. Some of the displaced farmers moved to other British colonies in the Americas, most notably  North  and  South Carolina , and  British Guiana , as well as  Panama . To work the plantations, planters imported enslaved West Africans to Barbados and other Caribbean islands.   The British abolished the  slave trade  in 1807 but not the institution itself. In 1816, slaves arose in the largest major slave rebellion in the island's history. Twenty thousand slaves from over seventy plantations rebelled. They drove whites off the plantations, but widespread killings did not take place. This was later termed Bussa's Rebellion after the slave ranger Bussa, who with his assistants hated slavery, found the treatment of slaves on Barbados to be intolerable, and believed the political climate in the UK made the time ripe to peacefully negotiate with planters for freedom (Davis, p. 211; Northrup, p. 191). Bussa's Rebellion failed. One hundred and twenty slaves died in combat or were immediately executed; another 144 were brought to trial and executed; remaining rebels were shipped off the island (Davis, pp. 212-213).   Slavery was finally abolished in the British Empire eighteen years later in 1834. In Barbados and the rest of the British West Indian colonies, full emancipation from slavery was preceded by an apprenticeship period that lasted four years.          Statue of  Lord Nelson  in  National Heroes Square  which predates the more famous  Nelson's Column  by some 27 years.       In 1884, the Barbados Agricultural Society sent a letter to  Sir Francis Hincks  requesting his private and public views on whether the Dominion of Canada would favourably entertain having the then colony of Barbados admitted as a member of the Canadian Confederation. Asked of  Canada  were the terms of the Canadian side to initiate discussions, and whether or not the island of Barbados could depend on the full influence of Canada in getting the change agreed to by the  United Kingdom . Then in 1952 the  Barbados Advocate  newspaper polled several prominent Barbadian politicians, lawyers, businessmen, the Speaker of the  Barbados House of Assembly  and later as first President of the  Senate , Sir Theodore Branker , Q.C. and found them to be in favour of immediate federation of Barbados along with the rest of the British  Caribbean  with complete Dominion Status within five years from the date of inauguration of the  West Indies Federation  with Canada.   However, plantation owners and merchants of British descent still dominated local politics, owing to the high income qualification required for voting. More than 70% of the population, many of them disenfranchised women, were excluded from the democratic process. It was not until the 1930s that the descendants of emancipated slaves began a movement for political rights. One of the leaders of this movement,  Sir Grantley Adams , founded the  Barbados Labour Party  in 1938, then known as the Barbados Progressive League. While being a staunch supporter of the monarchy, Adams and his party also demanded more rights for the poor and for the people. Progress toward a more democratic government in Barbados was made in 1942, when the exclusive income qualification was lowered and women were given the right to vote. By 1949 governmental control was wrested from the planters and, in 1958, Adams became Premier of Barbados.   From 1958 to 1962, Barbados was one of the ten members of the  West Indies Federation , an organisation doomed by nationalistic attitudes and by the fact that its members, as British colonies, held limited legislative power. Adams served as its first and only ""Premier"", but his leadership failed in attempts to form similar unions, and his continued defence of the monarchy was used by his opponents as evidence that he was no longer in touch with the needs of his country.  Errol Walton Barrow , a fervent reformer, became the new people's advocate. Barrow had left the BLP and formed the  Democratic Labour Party  as a liberal alternative to Adams' conservative government. Barrow instituted many progressive social programmes, such as free education for all Barbadians, and the School Meals system. By 1961, Barrow had replaced Adams as Premier and the DLP controlled the government.   With the Federation dissolved, Barbados had reverted to its former status, that of a  self-governing colony . The island negotiated its own independence at a constitutional conference with the United Kingdom in June 1966. After years of peaceful and democratic progress, Barbados finally became an independent state on 30 November 1966, with Errol Barrow its first Prime Minister. Upon independence Barbados maintained historical linkages with Britain by establishing membership to the  Commonwealth of Nations  grouping, a year later Barbados' International linkages were expanded by obtaining membership to the  United Nations  and the  Organization of American States .     [ edit ]   Government and politics          Parliamentary building.           Main articles:  Politics of Barbados  and  Monarchy of Barbados       Barbados has been an independent country since 30 November 1966. It functions as a  constitutional monarchy  and  parliamentary democracy , modeled on the British  Westminster system , with  Elizabeth II ,  Queen of Barbados , as  head of state  represented locally by the  Governor-General ,  Clifford Husbands  and the  Prime Minister  as the  head of the government . Its  Parliament  comprises thirty seats. It has been proposed that Barbados become a  republic  with a  president  replacing the  Barbadian sovereign ; this issue is still being debated, as the island has been stable and governmentally autonomous for decades.   Barbados is a full and participating member of the  Caribbean Community  (CARICOM), the  Caribbean (CARICOM) Single Market and Economy  (CSME), the  Caribbean Court of Justice  (CCJ), which pertains only to Barbados and  Guyana  but is expected to replace the UK  Privy Council  for the entire English-speaking Caribbean eventually, and the  Association of Caribbean States  (ACS). [ 7 ]   Barbados has a two party system, the two dominant parties being the ruling  Democratic Labour Party  and the  Barbados Labour Party . The Barbados Labour Party (BLP) had been in government for fifteen years, since 1993 until the 2008 general election. Under this administration, the Former Prime Minister, The Right Honourable Owen S. Arthur also acted as the Regional Leader of the CSM (Caribbean Single Market). The Right Honorable David Thompson is the Prime Minister of Barbados. [ 8 ]   On 11 April 2006, the 5-Member  UNCLOS  Annex VII Arbitral Tribunal, presided over by H.E. Judge  Stephen M. Schwebel , rendered after two years of international judicial proceedings, the landmark Barbados/Trinidad and Tobago Award, which resolved the maritime boundary delimitation (in the East, Central and West sectors) to satisfaction of both Parties and committed Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago to resolve their fisheries dispute by means of concluding a new Fisheries Agreement.     [ edit ]   Geography and climate of Barbados       Main article:  Geography and climate of Barbados              Map of Barbados              Beach near  Bridgetown , Barbados.       Barbados is extremely small for a Caribbean island. Relatively flat, it rises gently to the central highland region, the highest point being  Mount Hillaby , in the Scotland District, at 340 meters (1,100 ft) above sea level. The island is located in the Atlantic Ocean, to the east of the other Caribbean islands. The  climate  is tropical, with a rainy season from June to October.   Barbados is often spared the worst effects of the region's tropical storms and  hurricanes  during the rainy season as its far eastern location in the Atlantic Ocean puts it just outside the principal hurricane strike zone, and a hurricane hits about every 26 years. The last significant hit from a hurricane to cause severe damage to Barbados was  Hurricane Janet  in 1955.   In the parish of  Saint Michael  lies Barbados' capital and main city,  Bridgetown . Locally Bridgetown is sometimes referred to as ""The City"", but the most common reference is simply ""Town"". Other towns scattered across the island include  Holetown , in the parish of  Saint James ;  Oistins , in the parish of  Christ Church , and Speightstown, in the parish of  Saint Peter .   It is geologically composed of coral (90 m/300 ft thick). The land falls in a series of ""terraces"" in the west and goes into an incline in the east. Most of Barbados is circled by coral reefs.   The climate is moderate tropical with two seasons: dry and wet. The dry season (DecemberMay) and wet season (JuneNovember) gives an annual rainfall of 40-90 inches (1,0002,300 mm).     [ edit ]   Parishes       Main article:  Parishes of Barbados              Map of the parishes of Barbados       Barbados is  divided  into eleven administrative  parishes :     Christ Church   Saint Andrew   Saint George   Saint James   Saint John   Saint Joseph   Saint Lucy   Saint Michael   Saint Peter   Saint Philip   Saint Thomas       [ edit ]   Economy       Main article:  Economy of Barbados       Historically, the economy of Barbados had been dependent on  sugarcane  cultivation and related activities, but in recent years it has diversified into the  manufacturing  and  tourism  sectors. Offshore finance and information services have become important foreign exchange earners, and there is a healthy light manufacturing sector. In recent years the Government has been seen as business-friendly and economically sound. Since the late 1990s the island has seen a construction boom, with the development and redevelopment of hotels, office complexes, and homes.   The government continues its efforts to reduce  unemployment , encourage direct foreign investment, and privatize remaining state-owned enterprises. Unemployment has been reduced from around 14 percent in the past to under 10 percent.          Circulating  coins  2006       The economy contracted in 2001 and 2002 due to slowdowns in tourism, consumer spending and the impact of the  September 11, 2001 attacks , but rebounded in 2003 and has shown growth since 2004. Traditional trading partners include Canada, the  Caribbean Community  (especially  Trinidad and Tobago ), the United Kingdom and the United States.   Business links and investment flows have become substantial: as of 2003 the island saw from Canada  CA$  25 billion in investment holdings, placing it as one of Canada's top five destinations for Canadian  Foreign Direct Investment  (FDI). Businessman  Eugene Melnyk  of  Toronto , Canada, is said to be Barbados' richest permanent resident.   It was thought by key Barbadian industry sources that the year 2006 would have been one of the busiest years for building construction ever in Barbados, as the building-boom on the island entered the final stages for several multi-million dollar projects. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Transport       Main article:  Transport in Barbados       Transport on the island is good, with 'route taxis', called ""ZR's"" (pronounced "" Zed -Rs"" not ""Zee-Rs""), travelling to most points on the island. These small buses can at times be crowded, as passengers are generally never turned down, regardless of the number. However, they will usually take the more scenic routes to destinations. They generally depart from the capital  Bridgetown  or from  Speightstown  in the northern part of the island.          A  Mini Moke  at  Speightstown  beach       The island of Barbados's lone airport is the  Sir Grantley Adams International Airport (GAIA)  ( IATA  identifier  BGI ). It receives daily flights by several major airlines from points around the globe, as well as several smaller regional commercial airlines and charters. The airport serves as the main air-transportation hub for the Eastern Caribbean. It is undergoing a US$100 million upgrade and expansion.   There are three bus systems running seven days a week (though less frequently on Sundays), and a ride on any of them costs $1.50 BBD. The smaller buses from the two privately-owned systems (""ZRs"" and ""minibuses"") can give change; the larger blue and yellow buses from the government-operated  Barbados Transport Board  system cannot. Most routes require a connection in Bridgetown. Some drivers within the competitive privately owned systems are reluctant to advise persons to use competing services, even if those would be more suitable.   Some hotels also provide visitors with shuttles to points of interest on the island from outside the hotel lobby. There are several locally-owned and -operated vehicle rental agencies in Barbados but there are no multi-national car-rental agencies such as Avis, Europcar or Hertz.   There is also a helicopter shuttle service, which offers air taxi services to a number of sites around the island, mainly on the West Coast tourist belt. Air and water traffic is regulated by the  Barbados Port Authority .     [ edit ]   Tourist information   The island is well developed, and there are internationally known hotels offering world-class accommodation. Time-shares are available, and many of the smaller local hotels and private villas which dot the island have space available if booked in advance. The southern and western coasts of Barbados are popular, with the calm light blue Atlantic Ocean and their fine white and pinkish sandy beaches. Along the island's east coast the Atlantic Ocean side are tumbling waves which are perfect for light  surfing , but a little bit risky due to under-tow currents.   Shopping  districts are popular in Barbados, with ample duty-free shopping. There is also a festive night-life in mainly tourist areas such as the  Saint Lawrence Gap . Other attractions include wildlife reserves, jewellery stores,  scuba diving , helicopter rides,  golf ,  festivals  (the largest being the annual crop over festival July/Aug), sightseeing, cave exploration, exotic  drinks  and fine  clothes   shopping .     [ edit ]   Attractions, landmarks and points of interest   Tourism accounts for almost one half of the economy.

Close to 90% of all Barbadians (also known colloquially as  Bajan ) are of  African  descent (""Afro-Bajans""). A mix of many African ethnicities, notably the  Igbo ,  Akan  and  Yoruba people , they are mostly descendants of the  slave  labourers on the sugar plantations. The remainder of the population includes groups of Europeans (""Anglo-Bajans"" / ""Euro-Bajans"") mainly from the  United Kingdom , the  Republic of Ireland , Chinese locally known as Bajan-Chiney, Bajan Hindus from  India  and Muslims from  Bangladesh  and  Pakistan , and an influential ""Arab-Bajans"" group mainly of Christian  Syrians  and  Lebanese  descent. On the island are many people of  Creole  descent, a mixture of Afro-Caribbean and European descent (Primarily British, Irish and  Portuguese ).   Other groups in Barbados include people from the  United Kingdom ,  United States  and  Canada . Barbadians who return after years of residence in the U.S. are called ""Bajan Yankees""; this term is considered derogatory by some.   The country's official language is English, the local dialect of which is referred to as  Bajan , spoken by most. In religion, most Barbadians are  Christians  (67%), chiefly of the  Anglican Church , but there are Protestant,  Roman Catholic ,  Jehovah's Witness ,  Hindu ,  Muslim  and  Jewish  minorities. Barbados is a chief destination for emigrants from the South American nation of  Guyana . The biggest communities outside the Afro-Caribbean community are:     The  Indo-Guyanese , an important part of the economy due to the increase of immigrants from partner country  Guyana . There are reports of a growing Indo-Bajan diaspora originating from Guyana and  India . They introduced soca-chutney ,  roti  and many Indian dishes to Barbados' culture. Mostly from southern India and Hindu states, these 'Desi' peoples are growing in size but smaller than the equivalent communities in Trinidad & Guyana; Hinduism is one of Barbados' growing religions.   Euro-Bajans (4% of the population) [ 10 ]  have settled in Barbados since the 1500s, originating from  England , Portugal, Ireland and  Scotland . In 1643, there were 37,200 whites in Barbados (86% of the population). [ 11 ]  More commonly they are known as "" White Bajans "", although some carry Afro-Caribbean traces and vice-versa. Euro-Bajans introduced folk music, such as  Irish music  and Highland music, and certain place names, such as ""Scotland"", a mountainous region, and ""Trafalgar Square"" in Bridgetown, now renamed ""Heroes Square"". Among White Barbadians there exists an underclass known as  Redlegs ; the descendants of  indentured servants , and prisoners imported to the island. [ 12 ]   Chinese -Barbadians (or, as they are known on the island, ""Bajan-Chineys"") are a small portion of Barbados' Asian demographics, smaller than the equivalent communities of  Jamaica  and  Trinidad . Most if not all first arrived in the 1940s during the Second World War, originating mainly from the then British territory of  Hong Kong . Many Chinese-Bajans have the surnames Chin, Chynn or Lee, although other surnames prevail in certain areas of the island. Chinese food and culture is becoming part of everyday Bajan culture.   Lebanese and Syrians form the Middle Eastern community on the island and make up 89% of the Muslim population. Middle-Eastern Barbadians are often perceived to be the most successful group in business, along with the Chinese Bajans. During the  Arab Israeli Wars , many Syrians and Lebanese headed for the West Indies to escape conflict and poverty in the  Middle East . [ citation needed ]  Also Jewish people arrived in Barbados around the same time, creating the biggest synagogue in the West Indies.   Latin Americans have been migrating to the island since the 18th century, due to the close proximity of  South America , many  Venezuelans  had migrated to Barbados as labourers via Trinidad.  Brazilian Jews ,  Colombians  and  Panamanians  also live on the island. The Spanish language is now being encouraged to be taught as a second language in Barbadian schools over French.       [ edit ]   Culture          Banks beer at dusk           Main article:  Culture of Barbados     See also:  Music of Barbados     The influence of the English on Barbados is more noticeable than on other islands in the West Indies. A good example of this is the island's national sport:  cricket . Barbados has brought forth several great cricketers, including  Garfield Sobers  and  Frank Worrell .   Citizens are officially called Barbadians; Barbados' residents, however, colloquially refer to themselves or the products of the country as ""Bajan"". The term ""Bajan"" may have come from a localized pronunciation of the word Barbadian which at times can sound more like ""Bar-bajan"".   The largest  carnival -like cultural event which takes place on the island is the  Crop Over  festival. As in many other Caribbean and Latin American countries,  Crop Over  is an important event for many people on the island, as well as the thousands of tourists that flock to the island to participate in the annual events. The festival includes musical competitions and other traditional activities. It gets under way from the beginning of July, and ends with the costumed parade on Kadooment Day, held on the first Monday of August.   Barbados retains a strong British influence and is referred to by its neighbours as ""Little England"".     [ edit ]   Sports in Barbados     See also:  Cricket in the West Indies     As in other Caribbean countries of British descent,  cricket  is a favourite sport. In addition to several warm-up matches and six ""Super Eight"" matches, Barbados hosted the final of the  2007 Cricket World Cup .   In  golf , the  Barbados Open  is an annual stop on the  European Seniors Tour . In December 2006 the  WGC-World Cup  took place at the country's  Sandy Lane  resort on the Country Club course, an eighteen-hole course designed by  Tom Fazio .   Motorsports also play a role, with Rally Barbados occurring each summer and currently being listed on the FIA NACAM calendar.   Basketball  is a popular sport played at school or college and is increasing in popularity as is  volleyball , though volleyball is mainly played inside. At certain beaches such as Brandons beach in St. Michael people do get together to play  beach volleyball .   Other sports played include  hockey ,  table tennis ,  road tennis ,  football ,  rugby ,  polo  and  swimming .   Netball  is also popular with women in Barbados.     [ edit ]   National symbols     [ edit ]   Flower          A yellow and red Pride of Barbados ( Caesalpinia pulcherrima ).       The national flower is the Pride of Barbados or  Caesalpinia pulcherrima  (L.) Sw., which grows across the island.     [ edit ]   Flag   The tridented centered within the flag is a representation of the mythological  Neptune , god of the sea. The trident in its original unbroken form was taken from the former colonial seal, which itself was replaced by the current coat of arms. Used within the national flag, the left and right shafts of the trident were then designed as 'broken' representing the nation of Barbados breaking away from its historical and constitutional ties as a former colony.   The three points of the  trident  represent in Barbados the three principles of  democracy  - ""government of, for and by the people."" The broken trident is set in a centered vertical band of gold representing the sands of Barbados' beaches. The gold band itself is surrounded on both sides by vertical bands of ultramarine (blue) representing the sea and sky of Barbados.   The design for the flag was created by Grantley W. Prescod and was chosen from an open competition arranged by the Barbados government. Over a thousand entries were received. [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   Golden Shield   The Golden Shield in the coat of arms carries two "" Pride of Barbados "" flowers and the ""bearded"" fig tree ( Ficus citrifolia  or  Ficus barbata ), which was common on the island at the time of its settlement by the British and may have contributed to Barbados being so named.     [ edit ]   Coat of arms   The  coat of arms  depicts two animals which are supporting the shield. On the left is a "" dolphin fish "", symbolic of the fishing industry and seagoing past of Barbados. On the right is a  pelican , symbolic of a small island named  Pelican Island  that once existed off the coast of Bridgetown. Above the shield is the helmet of Barbados with an extended arm clutching two  sugar-cane  stalks. The ""cross"" formation made by the cane stalks represents the saltire cross upon which  Saint Andrew  was crucified. On the base of the Coat of Arms reads ""Pride and Industry"" in reference to the country's motto.     [ edit ]   National heroes       Main article:  Barbadian national heroes       On April 1998, the Order of National Heroes Act was passed by the  Parliament of Barbados . According to the government, the act established that 28 April (the centenary of the birth of Sir Grantley Adams) would be celebrated as  National Heroes' Day . The act also declared that there are ten national heroes of Barbados. All of which would be elevated to the title of the The Right Excellent. [ 14 ]   The ten official National Heroes of Barbados are:-     Bussa  ( - 1816)   Sarah Ann Gill  (1795 - 1866)   Samuel Jackman Prescod  (1806 - 1871)   Dr. Charles Duncan ONeal  (1879 - 1936)   Clement Osbourne Payne  (1904 - 1941)   Sir Grantley Herbert Adams  (1898 - 1987)   Rt.

Located at roughly 13 North of the  equator  and 59 West of the  prime meridian , it is considered a part of the  Lesser Antilles . Its closest island neighbours are  Saint Vincent & the Grenadines  and  Saint Lucia  to the west. To the south lies  Trinidad and Tobago with which Barbados now shares a fixed official maritime boundaryand also the  South American  mainland. Barbados's total land area is about 430 square kilometres (166 square miles), and is primarily low-lying, with some higher in the country's interior. The highest point in Barbados is  Mount Hillaby  in the parish of Saint Andrew. The geological composition of Barbados is of non-volcanic origin and is predominantly composed of  limestone - coral  formed by subduction of the South American plate colliding with the Caribbean plate. The island's climate is  tropical , with constant  trade winds  off the Atlantic Ocean serving to keep temperatures mild. Some less developed areas of the country contain tropical woodland and  mangroves . Other parts of the interior which contribute to the agriculture industry are dotted with large  sugarcane  estates and wide, gently sloping  pastures , with panoramic views down to the coast also.   Barbados's  human development index  ranking is consistently among the top 75 countries in the world. For example, in 2006, it was ranked 31st in the world, and third in the Americas, behind  Canada  and the  United States .

The origin of the name ""Barbados"" is controversial. The  Portuguese , en route to  Brazil  are credited as the first Europeans to discover and name the island. It is a matter of conjecture whether the word ""bearded"" refers to the long, hanging roots of the bearded fig-tree ( Ficus citrifolia ), indigenous to the island, to bearded  Caribs  inhabiting the island, or to the foam spraying over the outlying reefs giving the impression of a beard. In 1519, a map produced by the Genoese mapmaker  Visconte Maggiolo  showed and named Barbados in its correct position southeast of the island of  Dominica .   Another name associated with Barbados or her people is ""Bim"" or ""Bimshire"". The origin is uncertain but several theories abound, the  National Cultural Foundation  of Barbados follows the Dr.  Richard Allsopp  theory, which is that ""Bim"" was a word commonly used by slaves and that it derives from the phrase ""bi mu"" [ 3 ]  or either (""bem"", ""Ndi bem"", ""Nwanyi ibem"" or ""Nwoke ibem"") [ 4 ]  from an  Igbo  phrase, meaning ""my people."" In colloquial or literary contexts, ""Bim"" can also take a more deific tone, referring to the ""goddess"" Barbados. [ citation needed ]  The word Bim and Bimshire are recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary and the Chamber's Twentieth Century Dictionaries. Another possible source for ""Bim"" is reported to be in the Agricultural Reporter of 25 April 1868, The Rev. N Greenidge (father of one of the island's most famous scholars, Abel Hendy Jones Greenidge) suggested the listing of Bimshire as a county of England. Expressly named were ""Wiltshire, Hampshire, Berkshire, and Bimshire"". [ 5 ]  Lastly in the Daily Argosy (of Demerara i.e. Guyana) of 1652 it referred to Bim as a possible corruption of the word "" Byam "", who was a Royalist leader against the Parliamentarians. That source suggested the followers of Byam became known as Bims and became a word for all Barbadians. [ 6 ]     [ edit ]   Early history   The first indigenous people are thought to be  Amerindians  who arrived from  Venezuela  around approximately 350-400 B.C. The  Arawak  people were the second wave of migrants, arriving from South America around 800. In the thirteenth century, the Caribs arrived from South America in the third wave, displacing both the Arawak and the Salodoid-Barrancoid culture. For the next few centuries, the Caribs  like the Arawak and the Salodoid-Barrancoid  lived in isolation on the island.   The  Portuguese  then briefly claimed Barbados from the mid-1500s to the 1600s; and may have seized the indigenous  Caribs  on Barbados and used them as  slave labour . Other Caribs are believed to have fled the island to neighbouring islands. Apart from possibly displacing the Caribs, the Portuguese left little impact and by the 1610s, they left for South America, leaving the island uninhabited.     [ edit ]   British colonial rule   British sailors who landed on Barbados in 1625 arrived at the site of present-day  Holetown . From the arrival of the first British settlers in 16271628 until independence in 1966, Barbados was under uninterrupted British control. Nevertheless, Barbados always enjoyed a large measure of local autonomy. Its  House of Assembly  began meeting in 1639. Among the initial important British figures was Sir  William Courten .   With the increased implementation of slave codes, which created differential treatment between Africans and the white workers and planters, the island became increasingly unattractive to  poor whites . Black or slave codes were implemented in 1661, 1676, 1682, and 1688. In response to these codes, several slave rebellions were attempted or planned during this time, but none succeeded. However, an increasingly repressive legal system caused the gap between the treatment of typically white indentured servants and black slaves to widen. Imported slaves became much more attractive for the rich planters who would increasingly dominate the island not only economically but also politically. Some have speculated that, because the Africans could withstand tropical diseases and the climate much better than the white slave population, the white population decreased. This is inconsistent with the fact that many poor whites simply migrated to neighbouring islands and remained in tropical climates. Nevertheless, poor whites who had or acquired the means to emigrate often did so. Planters expanded their importation of African slaves to cultivate sugar cane. The Barbados turned from mainly English and Scots-Irish in the seventeenth century to overwhelmingly black by the end of the 18th century.   Barbados eventually had one of the world's biggest sugar industries after Jews from Brazil introduced the sugarcane to the island in the mid 1600s. This quickly replaced  tobacco  plantations on the islands which were previously the main export. As the  sugar  industry developed into its main commercial enterprise, Barbados was divided into large plantation estates that replaced the smallholdings of the early British settlers. Some of the displaced farmers moved to other British colonies in the Americas, most notably  North  and  South Carolina , and  British Guiana , as well as  Panama . To work the plantations, planters imported enslaved West Africans to Barbados and other Caribbean islands.   The British abolished the  slave trade  in 1807 but not the institution itself. In 1816, slaves arose in the largest major slave rebellion in the island's history. Twenty thousand slaves from over seventy plantations rebelled. They drove whites off the plantations, but widespread killings did not take place. This was later termed Bussa's Rebellion after the slave ranger Bussa, who with his assistants hated slavery, found the treatment of slaves on Barbados to be intolerable, and believed the political climate in the UK made the time ripe to peacefully negotiate with planters for freedom (Davis, p. 211; Northrup, p. 191). Bussa's Rebellion failed. One hundred and twenty slaves died in combat or were immediately executed; another 144 were brought to trial and executed; remaining rebels were shipped off the island (Davis, pp. 212-213).   Slavery was finally abolished in the British Empire eighteen years later in 1834. In Barbados and the rest of the British West Indian colonies, full emancipation from slavery was preceded by an apprenticeship period that lasted four years.

In 1884, the Barbados Agricultural Society sent a letter to  Sir Francis Hincks  requesting his private and public views on whether the Dominion of Canada would favourably entertain having the then colony of Barbados admitted as a member of the Canadian Confederation. Asked of  Canada  were the terms of the Canadian side to initiate discussions, and whether or not the island of Barbados could depend on the full influence of Canada in getting the change agreed to by the  United Kingdom . Then in 1952 the  Barbados Advocate  newspaper polled several prominent Barbadian politicians, lawyers, businessmen, the Speaker of the  Barbados House of Assembly  and later as first President of the  Senate , Sir Theodore Branker , Q.C. and found them to be in favour of immediate federation of Barbados along with the rest of the British  Caribbean  with complete Dominion Status within five years from the date of inauguration of the  West Indies Federation  with Canada.   However, plantation owners and merchants of British descent still dominated local politics, owing to the high income qualification required for voting. More than 70% of the population, many of them disenfranchised women, were excluded from the democratic process. It was not until the 1930s that the descendants of emancipated slaves began a movement for political rights. One of the leaders of this movement,  Sir Grantley Adams , founded the  Barbados Labour Party  in 1938, then known as the Barbados Progressive League. While being a staunch supporter of the monarchy, Adams and his party also demanded more rights for the poor and for the people. Progress toward a more democratic government in Barbados was made in 1942, when the exclusive income qualification was lowered and women were given the right to vote. By 1949 governmental control was wrested from the planters and, in 1958, Adams became Premier of Barbados.   From 1958 to 1962, Barbados was one of the ten members of the  West Indies Federation , an organisation doomed by nationalistic attitudes and by the fact that its members, as British colonies, held limited legislative power. Adams served as its first and only ""Premier"", but his leadership failed in attempts to form similar unions, and his continued defence of the monarchy was used by his opponents as evidence that he was no longer in touch with the needs of his country.  Errol Walton Barrow , a fervent reformer, became the new people's advocate. Barrow had left the BLP and formed the  Democratic Labour Party  as a liberal alternative to Adams' conservative government. Barrow instituted many progressive social programmes, such as free education for all Barbadians, and the School Meals system. By 1961, Barrow had replaced Adams as Premier and the DLP controlled the government.   With the Federation dissolved, Barbados had reverted to its former status, that of a  self-governing colony . The island negotiated its own independence at a constitutional conference with the United Kingdom in June 1966. After years of peaceful and democratic progress, Barbados finally became an independent state on 30 November 1966, with Errol Barrow its first Prime Minister. Upon independence Barbados maintained historical linkages with Britain by establishing membership to the  Commonwealth of Nations  grouping, a year later Barbados' International linkages were expanded by obtaining membership to the  United Nations  and the  Organization of American States .     [ edit ]   Government and politics          Parliamentary building.           Main articles:  Politics of Barbados  and  Monarchy of Barbados       Barbados has been an independent country since 30 November 1966. It functions as a  constitutional monarchy  and  parliamentary democracy , modeled on the British  Westminster system , with  Elizabeth II ,  Queen of Barbados , as  head of state  represented locally by the  Governor-General ,  Clifford Husbands  and the  Prime Minister  as the  head of the government . Its  Parliament  comprises thirty seats. It has been proposed that Barbados become a  republic  with a  president  replacing the  Barbadian sovereign ; this issue is still being debated, as the island has been stable and governmentally autonomous for decades.   Barbados is a full and participating member of the  Caribbean Community  (CARICOM), the  Caribbean (CARICOM) Single Market and Economy  (CSME), the  Caribbean Court of Justice  (CCJ), which pertains only to Barbados and  Guyana  but is expected to replace the UK  Privy Council  for the entire English-speaking Caribbean eventually, and the  Association of Caribbean States  (ACS). [ 7 ]   Barbados has a two party system, the two dominant parties being the ruling  Democratic Labour Party  and the  Barbados Labour Party . The Barbados Labour Party (BLP) had been in government for fifteen years, since 1993 until the 2008 general election. Under this administration, the Former Prime Minister, The Right Honourable Owen S. Arthur also acted as the Regional Leader of the CSM (Caribbean Single Market). The Right Honorable David Thompson is the Prime Minister of Barbados. [ 8 ]   On 11 April 2006, the 5-Member  UNCLOS  Annex VII Arbitral Tribunal, presided over by H.E. Judge  Stephen M. Schwebel , rendered after two years of international judicial proceedings, the landmark Barbados/Trinidad and Tobago Award, which resolved the maritime boundary delimitation (in the East, Central and West sectors) to satisfaction of both Parties and committed Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago to resolve their fisheries dispute by means of concluding a new Fisheries Agreement.     [ edit ]   Geography and climate of Barbados       Main article:  Geography and climate of Barbados              Map of Barbados              Beach near  Bridgetown , Barbados.       Barbados is extremely small for a Caribbean island. Relatively flat, it rises gently to the central highland region, the highest point being  Mount Hillaby , in the Scotland District, at 340 meters (1,100 ft) above sea level. The island is located in the Atlantic Ocean, to the east of the other Caribbean islands. The  climate  is tropical, with a rainy season from June to October.   Barbados is often spared the worst effects of the region's tropical storms and  hurricanes  during the rainy season as its far eastern location in the Atlantic Ocean puts it just outside the principal hurricane strike zone, and a hurricane hits about every 26 years. The last significant hit from a hurricane to cause severe damage to Barbados was  Hurricane Janet  in 1955.   In the parish of  Saint Michael  lies Barbados' capital and main city,  Bridgetown . Locally Bridgetown is sometimes referred to as ""The City"", but the most common reference is simply ""Town"". Other towns scattered across the island include  Holetown , in the parish of  Saint James ;  Oistins , in the parish of  Christ Church , and Speightstown, in the parish of  Saint Peter .   It is geologically composed of coral (90 m/300 ft thick). The land falls in a series of ""terraces"" in the west and goes into an incline in the east. Most of Barbados is circled by coral reefs.   The climate is moderate tropical with two seasons: dry and wet. The dry season (DecemberMay) and wet season (JuneNovember) gives an annual rainfall of 40-90 inches (1,0002,300 mm).     [ edit ]   Parishes       Main article:  Parishes of Barbados              Map of the parishes of Barbados       Barbados is  divided  into eleven administrative  parishes :     Christ Church   Saint Andrew   Saint George   Saint James   Saint John   Saint Joseph   Saint Lucy   Saint Michael   Saint Peter   Saint Philip   Saint Thomas       [ edit ]   Economy       Main article:  Economy of Barbados       Historically, the economy of Barbados had been dependent on  sugarcane  cultivation and related activities, but in recent years it has diversified into the  manufacturing  and  tourism  sectors. Offshore finance and information services have become important foreign exchange earners, and there is a healthy light manufacturing sector. In recent years the Government has been seen as business-friendly and economically sound. Since the late 1990s the island has seen a construction boom, with the development and redevelopment of hotels, office complexes, and homes.   The government continues its efforts to reduce  unemployment , encourage direct foreign investment, and privatize remaining state-owned enterprises. Unemployment has been reduced from around 14 percent in the past to under 10 percent.          Circulating  coins  2006       The economy contracted in 2001 and 2002 due to slowdowns in tourism, consumer spending and the impact of the  September 11, 2001 attacks , but rebounded in 2003 and has shown growth since 2004. Traditional trading partners include Canada, the  Caribbean Community  (especially  Trinidad and Tobago ), the United Kingdom and the United States.   Business links and investment flows have become substantial: as of 2003 the island saw from Canada  CA$  25 billion in investment holdings, placing it as one of Canada's top five destinations for Canadian  Foreign Direct Investment  (FDI). Businessman  Eugene Melnyk  of  Toronto , Canada, is said to be Barbados' richest permanent resident.   It was thought by key Barbadian industry sources that the year 2006 would have been one of the busiest years for building construction ever in Barbados, as the building-boom on the island entered the final stages for several multi-million dollar projects. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Transport       Main article:  Transport in Barbados       Transport on the island is good, with 'route taxis', called ""ZR's"" (pronounced "" Zed -Rs"" not ""Zee-Rs""), travelling to most points on the island. These small buses can at times be crowded, as passengers are generally never turned down, regardless of the number. However, they will usually take the more scenic routes to destinations. They generally depart from the capital  Bridgetown  or from  Speightstown  in the northern part of the island.          A  Mini Moke  at  Speightstown  beach       The island of Barbados's lone airport is the  Sir Grantley Adams International Airport (GAIA)  ( IATA  identifier  BGI ). It receives daily flights by several major airlines from points around the globe, as well as several smaller regional commercial airlines and charters. The airport serves as the main air-transportation hub for the Eastern Caribbean. It is undergoing a US$100 million upgrade and expansion.   There are three bus systems running seven days a week (though less frequently on Sundays), and a ride on any of them costs $1.50 BBD. The smaller buses from the two privately-owned systems (""ZRs"" and ""minibuses"") can give change; the larger blue and yellow buses from the government-operated  Barbados Transport Board  system cannot. Most routes require a connection in Bridgetown. Some drivers within the competitive privately owned systems are reluctant to advise persons to use competing services, even if those would be more suitable.   Some hotels also provide visitors with shuttles to points of interest on the island from outside the hotel lobby. There are several locally-owned and -operated vehicle rental agencies in Barbados but there are no multi-national car-rental agencies such as Avis, Europcar or Hertz.   There is also a helicopter shuttle service, which offers air taxi services to a number of sites around the island, mainly on the West Coast tourist belt. Air and water traffic is regulated by the  Barbados Port Authority .     [ edit ]   Tourist information   The island is well developed, and there are internationally known hotels offering world-class accommodation. Time-shares are available, and many of the smaller local hotels and private villas which dot the island have space available if booked in advance. The southern and western coasts of Barbados are popular, with the calm light blue Atlantic Ocean and their fine white and pinkish sandy beaches. Along the island's east coast the Atlantic Ocean side are tumbling waves which are perfect for light  surfing , but a little bit risky due to under-tow currents.   Shopping  districts are popular in Barbados, with ample duty-free shopping. There is also a festive night-life in mainly tourist areas such as the  Saint Lawrence Gap . Other attractions include wildlife reserves, jewellery stores,  scuba diving , helicopter rides,  golf ,  festivals  (the largest being the annual crop over festival July/Aug), sightseeing, cave exploration, exotic  drinks  and fine  clothes   shopping .     [ edit ]   Attractions, landmarks and points of interest   Tourism accounts for almost one half of the economy.

Close to 90% of all Barbadians (also known colloquially as  Bajan ) are of  African  descent (""Afro-Bajans""). A mix of many African ethnicities, notably the  Igbo ,  Akan  and  Yoruba people , they are mostly descendants of the  slave  labourers on the sugar plantations. The remainder of the population includes groups of Europeans (""Anglo-Bajans"" / ""Euro-Bajans"") mainly from the  United Kingdom , the  Republic of Ireland , Chinese locally known as Bajan-Chiney, Bajan Hindus from  India  and Muslims from  Bangladesh  and  Pakistan , and an influential ""Arab-Bajans"" group mainly of Christian  Syrians  and  Lebanese  descent. On the island are many people of  Creole  descent, a mixture of Afro-Caribbean and European descent (Primarily British, Irish and  Portuguese ).   Other groups in Barbados include people from the  United Kingdom ,  United States  and  Canada . Barbadians who return after years of residence in the U.S. are called ""Bajan Yankees""; this term is considered derogatory by some.   The country's official language is English, the local dialect of which is referred to as  Bajan , spoken by most. In religion, most Barbadians are  Christians  (67%), chiefly of the  Anglican Church , but there are Protestant,  Roman Catholic ,  Jehovah's Witness ,  Hindu ,  Muslim  and  Jewish  minorities. Barbados is a chief destination for emigrants from the South American nation of  Guyana . The biggest communities outside the Afro-Caribbean community are:     The  Indo-Guyanese , an important part of the economy due to the increase of immigrants from partner country  Guyana . There are reports of a growing Indo-Bajan diaspora originating from Guyana and  India . They introduced soca-chutney ,  roti  and many Indian dishes to Barbados' culture. Mostly from southern India and Hindu states, these 'Desi' peoples are growing in size but smaller than the equivalent communities in Trinidad & Guyana; Hinduism is one of Barbados' growing religions.   Euro-Bajans (4% of the population) [ 10 ]  have settled in Barbados since the 1500s, originating from  England , Portugal, Ireland and  Scotland . In 1643, there were 37,200 whites in Barbados (86% of the population). [ 11 ]  More commonly they are known as "" White Bajans "", although some carry Afro-Caribbean traces and vice-versa. Euro-Bajans introduced folk music, such as  Irish music  and Highland music, and certain place names, such as ""Scotland"", a mountainous region, and ""Trafalgar Square"" in Bridgetown, now renamed ""Heroes Square"". Among White Barbadians there exists an underclass known as  Redlegs ; the descendants of  indentured servants , and prisoners imported to the island. [ 12 ]   Chinese -Barbadians (or, as they are known on the island, ""Bajan-Chineys"") are a small portion of Barbados' Asian demographics, smaller than the equivalent communities of  Jamaica  and  Trinidad . Most if not all first arrived in the 1940s during the Second World War, originating mainly from the then British territory of  Hong Kong . Many Chinese-Bajans have the surnames Chin, Chynn or Lee, although other surnames prevail in certain areas of the island. Chinese food and culture is becoming part of everyday Bajan culture.   Lebanese and Syrians form the Middle Eastern community on the island and make up 89% of the Muslim population. Middle-Eastern Barbadians are often perceived to be the most successful group in business, along with the Chinese Bajans. During the  Arab Israeli Wars , many Syrians and Lebanese headed for the West Indies to escape conflict and poverty in the  Middle East . [ citation needed ]  Also Jewish people arrived in Barbados around the same time, creating the biggest synagogue in the West Indies.   Latin Americans have been migrating to the island since the 18th century, due to the close proximity of  South America , many  Venezuelans  had migrated to Barbados as labourers via Trinidad.  Brazilian Jews ,  Colombians  and  Panamanians  also live on the island. The Spanish language is now being encouraged to be taught as a second language in Barbadian schools over French.       [ edit ]   Culture          Banks beer at dusk           Main article:  Culture of Barbados     See also:  Music of Barbados     The influence of the English on Barbados is more noticeable than on other islands in the West Indies. A good example of this is the island's national sport:  cricket . Barbados has brought forth several great cricketers, including  Garfield Sobers  and  Frank Worrell .   Citizens are officially called Barbadians; Barbados' residents, however, colloquially refer to themselves or the products of the country as ""Bajan"". The term ""Bajan"" may have come from a localized pronunciation of the word Barbadian which at times can sound more like ""Bar-bajan"".   The largest  carnival -like cultural event which takes place on the island is the  Crop Over  festival. As in many other Caribbean and Latin American countries,  Crop Over  is an important event for many people on the island, as well as the thousands of tourists that flock to the island to participate in the annual events. The festival includes musical competitions and other traditional activities. It gets under way from the beginning of July, and ends with the costumed parade on Kadooment Day, held on the first Monday of August.   Barbados retains a strong British influence and is referred to by its neighbours as ""Little England"".     [ edit ]   Sports in Barbados     See also:  Cricket in the West Indies     As in other Caribbean countries of British descent,  cricket  is a favourite sport. In addition to several warm-up matches and six ""Super Eight"" matches, Barbados hosted the final of the  2007 Cricket World Cup .   In  golf , the  Barbados Open  is an annual stop on the  European Seniors Tour . In December 2006 the  WGC-World Cup  took place at the country's  Sandy Lane  resort on the Country Club course, an eighteen-hole course designed by  Tom Fazio .   Motorsports also play a role, with Rally Barbados occurring each summer and currently being listed on the FIA NACAM calendar.   Basketball  is a popular sport played at school or college and is increasing in popularity as is  volleyball , though volleyball is mainly played inside. At certain beaches such as Brandons beach in St. Michael people do get together to play  beach volleyball .   Other sports played include  hockey ,  table tennis ,  road tennis ,  football ,  rugby ,  polo  and  swimming .   Netball  is also popular with women in Barbados.     [ edit ]   National symbols     [ edit ]   Flower          A yellow and red Pride of Barbados ( Caesalpinia pulcherrima ).       The national flower is the Pride of Barbados or  Caesalpinia pulcherrima  (L.) Sw., which grows across the island.     [ edit ]   Flag   The tridented centered within the flag is a representation of the mythological  Neptune , god of the sea. The trident in its original unbroken form was taken from the former colonial seal, which itself was replaced by the current coat of arms. Used within the national flag, the left and right shafts of the trident were then designed as 'broken' representing the nation of Barbados breaking away from its historical and constitutional ties as a former colony.   The three points of the  trident  represent in Barbados the three principles of  democracy  - ""government of, for and by the people."" The broken trident is set in a centered vertical band of gold representing the sands of Barbados' beaches. The gold band itself is surrounded on both sides by vertical bands of ultramarine (blue) representing the sea and sky of Barbados.   The design for the flag was created by Grantley W. Prescod and was chosen from an open competition arranged by the Barbados government. Over a thousand entries were received. [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   Golden Shield   The Golden Shield in the coat of arms carries two "" Pride of Barbados "" flowers and the ""bearded"" fig tree ( Ficus citrifolia  or  Ficus barbata ), which was common on the island at the time of its settlement by the British and may have contributed to Barbados being so named.     [ edit ]   Coat of arms   The  coat of arms  depicts two animals which are supporting the shield. On the left is a "" dolphin fish "", symbolic of the fishing industry and seagoing past of Barbados. On the right is a  pelican , symbolic of a small island named  Pelican Island  that once existed off the coast of Bridgetown. Above the shield is the helmet of Barbados with an extended arm clutching two  sugar-cane  stalks. The ""cross"" formation made by the cane stalks represents the saltire cross upon which  Saint Andrew  was crucified. On the base of the Coat of Arms reads ""Pride and Industry"" in reference to the country's motto.     [ edit ]   National heroes       Main article:  Barbadian national heroes       On April 1998, the Order of National Heroes Act was passed by the  Parliament of Barbados . According to the government, the act established that 28 April (the centenary of the birth of Sir Grantley Adams) would be celebrated as  National Heroes' Day . The act also declared that there are ten national heroes of Barbados. All of which would be elevated to the title of the The Right Excellent. [ 14 ]   The ten official National Heroes of Barbados are:-     Bussa  ( - 1816)   Sarah Ann Gill  (1795 - 1866)   Samuel Jackman Prescod  (1806 - 1871)   Dr. Charles Duncan ONeal  (1879 - 1936)   Clement Osbourne Payne  (1904 - 1941)   Sir Grantley Herbert Adams  (1898 - 1987)   Rt.

Located at roughly 13 North of the  equator  and 59 West of the  prime meridian , it is considered a part of the  Lesser Antilles . Its closest island neighbours are  Saint Vincent & the Grenadines  and  Saint Lucia  to the west. To the south lies  Trinidad and Tobago with which Barbados now shares a fixed official maritime boundaryand also the  South American  mainland. Barbados's total land area is about 430 square kilometres (166 square miles), and is primarily low-lying, with some higher in the country's interior. The highest point in Barbados is  Mount Hillaby  in the parish of Saint Andrew. The geological composition of Barbados is of non-volcanic origin and is predominantly composed of  limestone - coral  formed by subduction of the South American plate colliding with the Caribbean plate. The island's climate is  tropical , with constant  trade winds  off the Atlantic Ocean serving to keep temperatures mild. Some less developed areas of the country contain tropical woodland and  mangroves . Other parts of the interior which contribute to the agriculture industry are dotted with large  sugarcane  estates and wide, gently sloping  pastures , with panoramic views down to the coast also.   Barbados's  human development index  ranking is consistently among the top 75 countries in the world. For example, in 2006, it was ranked 31st in the world, and third in the Americas, behind  Canada  and the  United States .

The origin of the name ""Barbados"" is controversial. The  Portuguese , en route to  Brazil  are credited as the first Europeans to discover and name the island. It is a matter of conjecture whether the word ""bearded"" refers to the long, hanging roots of the bearded fig-tree ( Ficus citrifolia ), indigenous to the island, to bearded  Caribs  inhabiting the island, or to the foam spraying over the outlying reefs giving the impression of a beard. In 1519, a map produced by the Genoese mapmaker  Visconte Maggiolo  showed and named Barbados in its correct position southeast of the island of  Dominica .   Another name associated with Barbados or her people is ""Bim"" or ""Bimshire"". The origin is uncertain but several theories abound, the  National Cultural Foundation  of Barbados follows the Dr.  Richard Allsopp  theory, which is that ""Bim"" was a word commonly used by slaves and that it derives from the phrase ""bi mu"" [ 3 ]  or either (""bem"", ""Ndi bem"", ""Nwanyi ibem"" or ""Nwoke ibem"") [ 4 ]  from an  Igbo  phrase, meaning ""my people."" In colloquial or literary contexts, ""Bim"" can also take a more deific tone, referring to the ""goddess"" Barbados. [ citation needed ]  The word Bim and Bimshire are recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary and the Chamber's Twentieth Century Dictionaries. Another possible source for ""Bim"" is reported to be in the Agricultural Reporter of 25 April 1868, The Rev. N Greenidge (father of one of the island's most famous scholars, Abel Hendy Jones Greenidge) suggested the listing of Bimshire as a county of England. Expressly named were ""Wiltshire, Hampshire, Berkshire, and Bimshire"". [ 5 ]  Lastly in the Daily Argosy (of Demerara i.e. Guyana) of 1652 it referred to Bim as a possible corruption of the word "" Byam "", who was a Royalist leader against the Parliamentarians. That source suggested the followers of Byam became known as Bims and became a word for all Barbadians. [ 6 ]     [ edit ]   Early history   The first indigenous people are thought to be  Amerindians  who arrived from  Venezuela  around approximately 350-400 B.C. The  Arawak  people were the second wave of migrants, arriving from South America around 800. In the thirteenth century, the Caribs arrived from South America in the third wave, displacing both the Arawak and the Salodoid-Barrancoid culture. For the next few centuries, the Caribs  like the Arawak and the Salodoid-Barrancoid  lived in isolation on the island.   The  Portuguese  then briefly claimed Barbados from the mid-1500s to the 1600s; and may have seized the indigenous  Caribs  on Barbados and used them as  slave labour . Other Caribs are believed to have fled the island to neighbouring islands. Apart from possibly displacing the Caribs, the Portuguese left little impact and by the 1610s, they left for South America, leaving the island uninhabited.     [ edit ]   British colonial rule   British sailors who landed on Barbados in 1625 arrived at the site of present-day  Holetown . From the arrival of the first British settlers in 16271628 until independence in 1966, Barbados was under uninterrupted British control. Nevertheless, Barbados always enjoyed a large measure of local autonomy. Its  House of Assembly  began meeting in 1639. Among the initial important British figures was Sir  William Courten .   With the increased implementation of slave codes, which created differential treatment between Africans and the white workers and planters, the island became increasingly unattractive to  poor whites . Black or slave codes were implemented in 1661, 1676, 1682, and 1688. In response to these codes, several slave rebellions were attempted or planned during this time, but none succeeded. However, an increasingly repressive legal system caused the gap between the treatment of typically white indentured servants and black slaves to widen. Imported slaves became much more attractive for the rich planters who would increasingly dominate the island not only economically but also politically. Some have speculated that, because the Africans could withstand tropical diseases and the climate much better than the white slave population, the white population decreased. This is inconsistent with the fact that many poor whites simply migrated to neighbouring islands and remained in tropical climates. Nevertheless, poor whites who had or acquired the means to emigrate often did so. Planters expanded their importation of African slaves to cultivate sugar cane. The Barbados turned from mainly English and Scots-Irish in the seventeenth century to overwhelmingly black by the end of the 18th century.   Barbados eventually had one of the world's biggest sugar industries after Jews from Brazil introduced the sugarcane to the island in the mid 1600s. This quickly replaced  tobacco  plantations on the islands which were previously the main export. As the  sugar  industry developed into its main commercial enterprise, Barbados was divided into large plantation estates that replaced the smallholdings of the early British settlers. Some of the displaced farmers moved to other British colonies in the Americas, most notably  North  and  South Carolina , and  British Guiana , as well as  Panama . To work the plantations, planters imported enslaved West Africans to Barbados and other Caribbean islands.   The British abolished the  slave trade  in 1807 but not the institution itself. In 1816, slaves arose in the largest major slave rebellion in the island's history. Twenty thousand slaves from over seventy plantations rebelled. They drove whites off the plantations, but widespread killings did not take place. This was later termed Bussa's Rebellion after the slave ranger Bussa, who with his assistants hated slavery, found the treatment of slaves on Barbados to be intolerable, and believed the political climate in the UK made the time ripe to peacefully negotiate with planters for freedom (Davis, p. 211; Northrup, p. 191). Bussa's Rebellion failed. One hundred and twenty slaves died in combat or were immediately executed; another 144 were brought to trial and executed; remaining rebels were shipped off the island (Davis, pp. 212-213).   Slavery was finally abolished in the British Empire eighteen years later in 1834. In Barbados and the rest of the British West Indian colonies, full emancipation from slavery was preceded by an apprenticeship period that lasted four years.          Statue of  Lord Nelson  in  National Heroes Square  which predates the more famous  Nelson's Column  by some 27 years.       In 1884, the Barbados Agricultural Society sent a letter to  Sir Francis Hincks  requesting his private and public views on whether the Dominion of Canada would favourably entertain having the then colony of Barbados admitted as a member of the Canadian Confederation. Asked of  Canada  were the terms of the Canadian side to initiate discussions, and whether or not the island of Barbados could depend on the full influence of Canada in getting the change agreed to by the  United Kingdom . Then in 1952 the  Barbados Advocate  newspaper polled several prominent Barbadian politicians, lawyers, businessmen, the Speaker of the  Barbados House of Assembly  and later as first President of the  Senate , Sir Theodore Branker , Q.C. and found them to be in favour of immediate federation of Barbados along with the rest of the British  Caribbean  with complete Dominion Status within five years from the date of inauguration of the  West Indies Federation  with Canada.   However, plantation owners and merchants of British descent still dominated local politics, owing to the high income qualification required for voting. More than 70% of the population, many of them disenfranchised women, were excluded from the democratic process. It was not until the 1930s that the descendants of emancipated slaves began a movement for political rights. One of the leaders of this movement,  Sir Grantley Adams , founded the  Barbados Labour Party  in 1938, then known as the Barbados Progressive League. While being a staunch supporter of the monarchy, Adams and his party also demanded more rights for the poor and for the people. Progress toward a more democratic government in Barbados was made in 1942, when the exclusive income qualification was lowered and women were given the right to vote. By 1949 governmental control was wrested from the planters and, in 1958, Adams became Premier of Barbados.   From 1958 to 1962, Barbados was one of the ten members of the  West Indies Federation , an organisation doomed by nationalistic attitudes and by the fact that its members, as British colonies, held limited legislative power. Adams served as its first and only ""Premier"", but his leadership failed in attempts to form similar unions, and his continued defence of the monarchy was used by his opponents as evidence that he was no longer in touch with the needs of his country.  Errol Walton Barrow , a fervent reformer, became the new people's advocate. Barrow had left the BLP and formed the  Democratic Labour Party  as a liberal alternative to Adams' conservative government. Barrow instituted many progressive social programmes, such as free education for all Barbadians, and the School Meals system. By 1961, Barrow had replaced Adams as Premier and the DLP controlled the government.   With the Federation dissolved, Barbados had reverted to its former status, that of a  self-governing colony . The island negotiated its own independence at a constitutional conference with the United Kingdom in June 1966. After years of peaceful and democratic progress, Barbados finally became an independent state on 30 November 1966, with Errol Barrow its first Prime Minister. Upon independence Barbados maintained historical linkages with Britain by establishing membership to the  Commonwealth of Nations  grouping, a year later Barbados' International linkages were expanded by obtaining membership to the  United Nations  and the  Organization of American States .     [ edit ]   Government and politics          Parliamentary building.           Main articles:  Politics of Barbados  and  Monarchy of Barbados       Barbados has been an independent country since 30 November 1966. It functions as a  constitutional monarchy  and  parliamentary democracy , modeled on the British  Westminster system , with  Elizabeth II ,  Queen of Barbados , as  head of state  represented locally by the  Governor-General ,  Clifford Husbands  and the  Prime Minister  as the  head of the government . Its  Parliament  comprises thirty seats. It has been proposed that Barbados become a  republic  with a  president  replacing the  Barbadian sovereign ; this issue is still being debated, as the island has been stable and governmentally autonomous for decades.   Barbados is a full and participating member of the  Caribbean Community  (CARICOM), the  Caribbean (CARICOM) Single Market and Economy  (CSME), the  Caribbean Court of Justice  (CCJ), which pertains only to Barbados and  Guyana  but is expected to replace the UK  Privy Council  for the entire English-speaking Caribbean eventually, and the  Association of Caribbean States  (ACS). [ 7 ]   Barbados has a two party system, the two dominant parties being the ruling  Democratic Labour Party  and the  Barbados Labour Party . The Barbados Labour Party (BLP) had been in government for fifteen years, since 1993 until the 2008 general election. Under this administration, the Former Prime Minister, The Right Honourable Owen S. Arthur also acted as the Regional Leader of the CSM (Caribbean Single Market). The Right Honorable David Thompson is the Prime Minister of Barbados. [ 8 ]   On 11 April 2006, the 5-Member  UNCLOS  Annex VII Arbitral Tribunal, presided over by H.E. Judge  Stephen M. Schwebel , rendered after two years of international judicial proceedings, the landmark Barbados/Trinidad and Tobago Award, which resolved the maritime boundary delimitation (in the East, Central and West sectors) to satisfaction of both Parties and committed Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago to resolve their fisheries dispute by means of concluding a new Fisheries Agreement.     [ edit ]   Geography and climate of Barbados       Main article:  Geography and climate of Barbados              Map of Barbados              Beach near  Bridgetown , Barbados.       Barbados is extremely small for a Caribbean island. Relatively flat, it rises gently to the central highland region, the highest point being  Mount Hillaby , in the Scotland District, at 340 meters (1,100 ft) above sea level. The island is located in the Atlantic Ocean, to the east of the other Caribbean islands. The  climate  is tropical, with a rainy season from June to October.   Barbados is often spared the worst effects of the region's tropical storms and  hurricanes  during the rainy season as its far eastern location in the Atlantic Ocean puts it just outside the principal hurricane strike zone, and a hurricane hits about every 26 years. The last significant hit from a hurricane to cause severe damage to Barbados was  Hurricane Janet  in 1955.   In the parish of  Saint Michael  lies Barbados' capital and main city,  Bridgetown . Locally Bridgetown is sometimes referred to as ""The City"", but the most common reference is simply ""Town"". Other towns scattered across the island include  Holetown , in the parish of  Saint James ;  Oistins , in the parish of  Christ Church , and Speightstown, in the parish of  Saint Peter .   It is geologically composed of coral (90 m/300 ft thick). The land falls in a series of ""terraces"" in the west and goes into an incline in the east. Most of Barbados is circled by coral reefs.   The climate is moderate tropical with two seasons: dry and wet. The dry season (DecemberMay) and wet season (JuneNovember) gives an annual rainfall of 40-90 inches (1,0002,300 mm).     [ edit ]   Parishes       Main article:  Parishes of Barbados              Map of the parishes of Barbados       Barbados is  divided  into eleven administrative  parishes :     Christ Church   Saint Andrew   Saint George   Saint James   Saint John   Saint Joseph   Saint Lucy   Saint Michael   Saint Peter   Saint Philip   Saint Thomas       [ edit ]   Economy       Main article:  Economy of Barbados       Historically, the economy of Barbados had been dependent on  sugarcane  cultivation and related activities, but in recent years it has diversified into the  manufacturing  and  tourism  sectors. Offshore finance and information services have become important foreign exchange earners, and there is a healthy light manufacturing sector. In recent years the Government has been seen as business-friendly and economically sound. Since the late 1990s the island has seen a construction boom, with the development and redevelopment of hotels, office complexes, and homes.   The government continues its efforts to reduce  unemployment , encourage direct foreign investment, and privatize remaining state-owned enterprises. Unemployment has been reduced from around 14 percent in the past to under 10 percent.          Circulating  coins  2006       The economy contracted in 2001 and 2002 due to slowdowns in tourism, consumer spending and the impact of the  September 11, 2001 attacks , but rebounded in 2003 and has shown growth since 2004. Traditional trading partners include Canada, the  Caribbean Community  (especially  Trinidad and Tobago ), the United Kingdom and the United States.   Business links and investment flows have become substantial: as of 2003 the island saw from Canada  CA$  25 billion in investment holdings, placing it as one of Canada's top five destinations for Canadian  Foreign Direct Investment  (FDI). Businessman  Eugene Melnyk  of  Toronto , Canada, is said to be Barbados' richest permanent resident.   It was thought by key Barbadian industry sources that the year 2006 would have been one of the busiest years for building construction ever in Barbados, as the building-boom on the island entered the final stages for several multi-million dollar projects. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Transport       Main article:  Transport in Barbados       Transport on the island is good, with 'route taxis', called ""ZR's"" (pronounced "" Zed -Rs"" not ""Zee-Rs""), travelling to most points on the island. These small buses can at times be crowded, as passengers are generally never turned down, regardless of the number. However, they will usually take the more scenic routes to destinations. They generally depart from the capital  Bridgetown  or from  Speightstown  in the northern part of the island.          A  Mini Moke  at  Speightstown  beach       The island of Barbados's lone airport is the  Sir Grantley Adams International Airport (GAIA)  ( IATA  identifier  BGI ). It receives daily flights by several major airlines from points around the globe, as well as several smaller regional commercial airlines and charters. The airport serves as the main air-transportation hub for the Eastern Caribbean. It is undergoing a US$100 million upgrade and expansion.   There are three bus systems running seven days a week (though less frequently on Sundays), and a ride on any of them costs $1.50 BBD. The smaller buses from the two privately-owned systems (""ZRs"" and ""minibuses"") can give change; the larger blue and yellow buses from the government-operated  Barbados Transport Board  system cannot. Most routes require a connection in Bridgetown. Some drivers within the competitive privately owned systems are reluctant to advise persons to use competing services, even if those would be more suitable.   Some hotels also provide visitors with shuttles to points of interest on the island from outside the hotel lobby. There are several locally-owned and -operated vehicle rental agencies in Barbados but there are no multi-national car-rental agencies such as Avis, Europcar or Hertz.   There is also a helicopter shuttle service, which offers air taxi services to a number of sites around the island, mainly on the West Coast tourist belt. Air and water traffic is regulated by the  Barbados Port Authority .     [ edit ]   Tourist information   The island is well developed, and there are internationally known hotels offering world-class accommodation. Time-shares are available, and many of the smaller local hotels and private villas which dot the island have space available if booked in advance. The southern and western coasts of Barbados are popular, with the calm light blue Atlantic Ocean and their fine white and pinkish sandy beaches. Along the island's east coast the Atlantic Ocean side are tumbling waves which are perfect for light  surfing , but a little bit risky due to under-tow currents.   Shopping  districts are popular in Barbados, with ample duty-free shopping. There is also a festive night-life in mainly tourist areas such as the  Saint Lawrence Gap . Other attractions include wildlife reserves, jewellery stores,  scuba diving , helicopter rides,  golf ,  festivals  (the largest being the annual crop over festival July/Aug), sightseeing, cave exploration, exotic  drinks  and fine  clothes   shopping .     [ edit ]   Attractions, landmarks and points of interest   Tourism accounts for almost one half of the economy.

Close to 90% of all Barbadians (also known colloquially as  Bajan ) are of  African  descent (""Afro-Bajans""). A mix of many African ethnicities, notably the  Igbo ,  Akan  and  Yoruba people , they are mostly descendants of the  slave  labourers on the sugar plantations. The remainder of the population includes groups of Europeans (""Anglo-Bajans"" / ""Euro-Bajans"") mainly from the  United Kingdom , the  Republic of Ireland , Chinese locally known as Bajan-Chiney, Bajan Hindus from  India  and Muslims from  Bangladesh  and  Pakistan , and an influential ""Arab-Bajans"" group mainly of Christian  Syrians  and  Lebanese  descent. On the island are many people of  Creole  descent, a mixture of Afro-Caribbean and European descent (Primarily British, Irish and  Portuguese ).   Other groups in Barbados include people from the  United Kingdom ,  United States  and  Canada . Barbadians who return after years of residence in the U.S. are called ""Bajan Yankees""; this term is considered derogatory by some.   The country's official language is English, the local dialect of which is referred to as  Bajan , spoken by most. In religion, most Barbadians are  Christians  (67%), chiefly of the  Anglican Church , but there are Protestant,  Roman Catholic ,  Jehovah's Witness ,  Hindu ,  Muslim  and  Jewish  minorities. Barbados is a chief destination for emigrants from the South American nation of  Guyana . The biggest communities outside the Afro-Caribbean community are:     The  Indo-Guyanese , an important part of the economy due to the increase of immigrants from partner country  Guyana . There are reports of a growing Indo-Bajan diaspora originating from Guyana and  India . They introduced soca-chutney ,  roti  and many Indian dishes to Barbados' culture. Mostly from southern India and Hindu states, these 'Desi' peoples are growing in size but smaller than the equivalent communities in Trinidad & Guyana; Hinduism is one of Barbados' growing religions.   Euro-Bajans (4% of the population) [ 10 ]  have settled in Barbados since the 1500s, originating from  England , Portugal, Ireland and  Scotland . In 1643, there were 37,200 whites in Barbados (86% of the population). [ 11 ]  More commonly they are known as "" White Bajans "", although some carry Afro-Caribbean traces and vice-versa. Euro-Bajans introduced folk music, such as  Irish music  and Highland music, and certain place names, such as ""Scotland"", a mountainous region, and ""Trafalgar Square"" in Bridgetown, now renamed ""Heroes Square"". Among White Barbadians there exists an underclass known as  Redlegs ; the descendants of  indentured servants , and prisoners imported to the island. [ 12 ]   Chinese -Barbadians (or, as they are known on the island, ""Bajan-Chineys"") are a small portion of Barbados' Asian demographics, smaller than the equivalent communities of  Jamaica  and  Trinidad . Most if not all first arrived in the 1940s during the Second World War, originating mainly from the then British territory of  Hong Kong . Many Chinese-Bajans have the surnames Chin, Chynn or Lee, although other surnames prevail in certain areas of the island. Chinese food and culture is becoming part of everyday Bajan culture.   Lebanese and Syrians form the Middle Eastern community on the island and make up 89% of the Muslim population. Middle-Eastern Barbadians are often perceived to be the most successful group in business, along with the Chinese Bajans. During the  Arab Israeli Wars , many Syrians and Lebanese headed for the West Indies to escape conflict and poverty in the  Middle East . [ citation needed ]  Also Jewish people arrived in Barbados around the same time, creating the biggest synagogue in the West Indies.   Latin Americans have been migrating to the island since the 18th century, due to the close proximity of  South America , many  Venezuelans  had migrated to Barbados as labourers via Trinidad.  Brazilian Jews ,  Colombians  and  Panamanians  also live on the island. The Spanish language is now being encouraged to be taught as a second language in Barbadian schools over French.       [ edit ]   Culture          Banks beer at dusk           Main article:  Culture of Barbados     See also:  Music of Barbados     The influence of the English on Barbados is more noticeable than on other islands in the West Indies. A good example of this is the island's national sport:  cricket . Barbados has brought forth several great cricketers, including  Garfield Sobers  and  Frank Worrell .   Citizens are officially called Barbadians; Barbados' residents, however, colloquially refer to themselves or the products of the country as ""Bajan"". The term ""Bajan"" may have come from a localized pronunciation of the word Barbadian which at times can sound more like ""Bar-bajan"".   The largest  carnival -like cultural event which takes place on the island is the  Crop Over  festival. As in many other Caribbean and Latin American countries,  Crop Over  is an important event for many people on the island, as well as the thousands of tourists that flock to the island to participate in the annual events. The festival includes musical competitions and other traditional activities. It gets under way from the beginning of July, and ends with the costumed parade on Kadooment Day, held on the first Monday of August.   Barbados retains a strong British influence and is referred to by its neighbours as ""Little England"".     [ edit ]   Sports in Barbados     See also:  Cricket in the West Indies     As in other Caribbean countries of British descent,  cricket  is a favourite sport. In addition to several warm-up matches and six ""Super Eight"" matches, Barbados hosted the final of the  2007 Cricket World Cup .   In  golf , the  Barbados Open  is an annual stop on the  European Seniors Tour . In December 2006 the  WGC-World Cup  took place at the country's  Sandy Lane  resort on the Country Club course, an eighteen-hole course designed by  Tom Fazio .   Motorsports also play a role, with Rally Barbados occurring each summer and currently being listed on the FIA NACAM calendar.   Basketball  is a popular sport played at school or college and is increasing in popularity as is  volleyball , though volleyball is mainly played inside. At certain beaches such as Brandons beach in St. Michael people do get together to play  beach volleyball .   Other sports played include  hockey ,  table tennis ,  road tennis ,  football ,  rugby ,  polo  and  swimming .   Netball  is also popular with women in Barbados.     [ edit ]   National symbols     [ edit ]   Flower          A yellow and red Pride of Barbados ( Caesalpinia pulcherrima ).       The national flower is the Pride of Barbados or  Caesalpinia pulcherrima  (L.) Sw., which grows across the island.     [ edit ]   Flag   The tridented centered within the flag is a representation of the mythological  Neptune , god of the sea. The trident in its original unbroken form was taken from the former colonial seal, which itself was replaced by the current coat of arms. Used within the national flag, the left and right shafts of the trident were then designed as 'broken' representing the nation of Barbados breaking away from its historical and constitutional ties as a former colony.   The three points of the  trident  represent in Barbados the three principles of  democracy  - ""government of, for and by the people."" The broken trident is set in a centered vertical band of gold representing the sands of Barbados' beaches. The gold band itself is surrounded on both sides by vertical bands of ultramarine (blue) representing the sea and sky of Barbados.   The design for the flag was created by Grantley W. Prescod and was chosen from an open competition arranged by the Barbados government. Over a thousand entries were received. [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   Golden Shield   The Golden Shield in the coat of arms carries two "" Pride of Barbados "" flowers and the ""bearded"" fig tree ( Ficus citrifolia  or  Ficus barbata ), which was common on the island at the time of its settlement by the British and may have contributed to Barbados being so named.     [ edit ]   Coat of arms   The  coat of arms  depicts two animals which are supporting the shield. On the left is a "" dolphin fish "", symbolic of the fishing industry and seagoing past of Barbados. On the right is a  pelican , symbolic of a small island named  Pelican Island  that once existed off the coast of Bridgetown. Above the shield is the helmet of Barbados with an extended arm clutching two  sugar-cane  stalks. The ""cross"" formation made by the cane stalks represents the saltire cross upon which  Saint Andrew  was crucified. On the base of the Coat of Arms reads ""Pride and Industry"" in reference to the country's motto.     [ edit ]   National heroes       Main article:  Barbadian national heroes       On April 1998, the Order of National Heroes Act was passed by the  Parliament of Barbados . According to the government, the act established that 28 April (the centenary of the birth of Sir Grantley Adams) would be celebrated as  National Heroes' Day . The act also declared that there are ten national heroes of Barbados. All of which would be elevated to the title of the The Right Excellent. [ 14 ]   The ten official National Heroes of Barbados are:-     Bussa  ( - 1816)   Sarah Ann Gill  (1795 - 1866)   Samuel Jackman Prescod  (1806 - 1871)   Dr. Charles Duncan ONeal  (1879 - 1936)   Clement Osbourne Payne  (1904 - 1941)   Sir Grantley Herbert Adams  (1898 - 1987)   Rt.

The South African coast stretches 2,798 kilometres (1,739 mi) [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  and borders both the  Atlantic  and  Indian   oceans . [ 7 ]  To the north of South Africa lie  Namibia ,  Botswana  and  Zimbabwe , to the east are  Mozambique  and  Swaziland , while the  Kingdom of Lesotho  is an independent  enclave  surrounded by South African territory. [ 8 ]   Modern human beings have inhabited South Africa for more than 100,000 years. [ 9 ]  A century and a half after the discovery of the  Cape Sea Route , the  Dutch East India Company   founded  a refreshment station at what would become  Cape Town  in 1652. [ 10 ]  Cape Town became a British colony in 1806. European settlement expanded during the 1820s as the  Boers  (original  Dutch ,  Flemish ,  German  and  French  settlers) and the British  1820 Settlers  claimed land in the north and east of the country. Conflicts arose among the Xhosa, Zulu and Afrikaner groups. However, the discovery of diamonds and later gold triggered the conflict known as the  Anglo-Boer War  as the Boers and the British fought for the control of the South African mineral wealth. Although the Boers were defeated, limited independence was given to South Africa in 1910 as a British dominion. Anti-British policies focused on ultimate independence which was achieved in 1961 when South Africa was declared a  republic . The leading  National Party  legislated for a continuation of racial segregation begun under Dutch and British colonial rule, Boer republics, and subsequent South African governments (and which in 1948 became legally institutionalised  segregation  known as  apartheid ), despite opposition both in and outside of the country. In 1990 the then president  F.W. de Klerk  began to dismantle this legislation, and in 1994 the first democratic election was held in South Africa. This election brought  Nelson Mandela  and the current ruling party, the  African National Congress  to power, and the country rejoined the  Commonwealth of Nations .   South Africa is known for its diversity in cultures, languages, and religious beliefs, and eleven official languages are recognised in its  constitution . [ 7 ]  English is the most commonly spoken language in official and commercial public life, however it is only the fifth most spoken home language. [ 7 ]  South Africa is ethnically diverse, with the largest  Caucasian ,  Indian , and  racially mixed  communities in Africa. Although 79.6% of the South African population is  Black , [ 2 ]  this category is neither culturally nor linguistically homogeneous, as people within this classification speak a number of different  Bantu languages , nine of which have official status. [ 7 ]  Midyear 2007, the South African population was estimated at 47.9 million.

(September 2008)       Main article:  History of South Africa   South Africa contains some of the oldest archaeological sites in the world. [ 11 ]   [ 12 ]  Extensive fossil remains at the  Sterkfontein ,  Kromdraai  and Makapansgat caves suggest that various  australopithecines  existed in South Africa from about three million years ago. [ 13 ]  These were succeeded by various species of  Homo , including  Homo habilis ,  Homo erectus  and modern humans,  Homo sapiens . Settlements of  Bantu -speaking peoples, who were  iron -using agriculturists and herdsmen, were already present south of the  Limpopo River  by the fourth or fifth century (see  Bantu expansion ) displacing and absorbing the original  KhoiSan  speakers. They slowly moved south and the earliest ironworks in modern-day  KwaZulu-Natal Province  are believed to date from around 1050. The southernmost group was the  Xhosa  people, whose language incorporates certain linguistic traits from the earlier KhoiSan people, reaching the  Fish River , in today's  Eastern Cape Province . These  Iron Age  populations displaced earlier people, who often had  hunter-gatherer  societies, as they migrated.     European colonisation          Painting of an account of the arrival of  Jan van Riebeeck , the first  European  to settle in South Africa, with  Devil's Peak  in the background       In 1487, the  Portuguese  explorer  Bartolomeu Dias  became the first European to reach the southernmost point of Africa. Initially named The Cape of Storms, The King of Portugal,  John II , renamed it the  Cabo da Boa Esperana  or  Cape of Good Hope  as it led to the riches of India. This great feat of navigation was later immortalised in  Cames ' epic Portuguese poem,  The Lusiads  (1572). In 1652, a refreshment station was established at the  Cape of Good Hope  by  Jan van Riebeeck  on behalf of the  Dutch East India Company .  Slaves  were brought from  Indonesia ,  Madagascar , and India as a labour source for the Dutch immigrants in  Cape Town . As they expanded east, the Dutch settlers eventually met the south-westerly expanding  Xhosa  people in the region of the  Fish River . A series of wars, called the  Cape Frontier Wars , ensued, mainly caused by conflicting land and livestock interests.   Great Britain  took over the  Cape of Good Hope  area in 1795 ostensibly to stop it falling into the hands of the Revolutionary French, but also seeking to use  Cape Town  in particular as a stop on the route to Australia and India. It was later returned to the Dutch in 1803, but soon afterwards the  Dutch East India Company  declared bankruptcy, and the British annexed the Cape Colony in 1806. The British continued the frontier wars against the Xhosa, pushing the eastern frontier eastward through a line of forts established along the Fish River and consolidating it by encouraging  British settlement . Due to pressure of  abolitionist  societies in Britain, the  British parliament  first stopped its global  slave trade  with the passage of the  Slave Trade Act 1807 , then abolished slavery in all its colonies with the  Slavery Abolition Act 1833 . During the 1830s, approximately 12 000  Boers  (later known as  Voortrekkers ), departed from the  Cape Colony , where they were subjected to British control, to the future Natal, Orange Free State and Transvaal regions. The Boers founded the  Boer Republics  - the  South African Republic  (Now  Gauteng ,  Limpopo ,  Mpumalanga  and  North West  provinces) and the  Orange Free State  ( Free State ).   The discovery of  diamonds  in 1867 and  gold  in 1884 in the interior encouraged economic growth and immigration, intensifying the subjugation of the indigenous people. These important economic resources did not only play a role between European and the indigenous population but also between the Boers and the British. [ 14 ]   The  Boer Republics  successfully resisted British encroachments during the  First Boer War  (18801881) using  guerrilla warfare  tactics, much better suited to local conditions. However, the British returned in greater numbers, more experience, and more suitable tactics in the  Second Boer War  (18991902). The Boers' attempt to ally themselves with  German South-West Africa  provided the British with yet another excuse to take control of the Boer Republics. [ citation needed ]           Boers  in combat (1881).         Independence   After four years of negotiating, the  Union of South Africa  was created from the  Cape  and  Natal  colonies, as well as the republics of  Orange Free State  and  Transvaal , on 31 May 1910, exactly eight years after the end of the Second Boer War. The newly created Union of South Africa was a  dominion . The  Natives' Land Act  of 1913 severely restricted the ownership of land by 'blacks', at that stage to a mere 7% of the country, although this amount was eventually increased marginally. [ 15 ]  The union was effectively granted independence from the United Kingdom with the passage of the  Statute of Westminster , which morphed the  British king's  position within South Africa into that of the distinct  King of South Africa . In 1934, the  South African Party  and  National Party  merged to form the  United Party , seeking reconciliation between Afrikaners and English-speaking ""Whites"", but split in 1939 over the entry of the Union into  World War II  as an ally of the United Kingdom, a move which the National Party strongly opposed.   In 1948, the  National Party  was elected to power, and intensified the implementation of racial segregation that had begun under Dutch and British colonial rule, and subsequent South African governments since the Union was formed. The Nationalist Government systematised existing segregationist laws, and the system of segregation became known collectively as  apartheid . Not surprisingly, this segregation also applied to the wealth acquired during rapid industrialisation of the 1950s, '60s, and '70s. While the White minority enjoyed the highest  standard of living  in all of Africa, often comparable to  First World  western nations, the Black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard, including income, education, housing, and life expectancy. On 31 May 1961, following a whites-only  referendum , the country became a  republic  and left the (British)  Commonwealth . The office of  Governor-General  was abolished and replaced with the position of  State President .   Apartheid became increasingly controversial, leading to widespread  sanctions ,  divestment  and growing unrest and oppression within South Africa. (See also the article on the  History of South Africa in the apartheid era .) A long period of harsh suppression by the government, and at times violent resistance,  strikes , marches, protests, and  sabotage  by bombing and other means, by various anti-apartheid movements, most notably the  African National Congress  (ANC), followed. In the late 1970s, South Africa began a programme of  nuclear weapons  development and in the following decade it produced six deliverable nuclear weapons. The rationale for the nuclear arsenal is disputed, but it is believed [ who? ]  that  Vorster  and  P.W. Botha  wanted to be able to catalyse American intervention in the event of a war between South Africa and the  Cuban -supported  MPLA  government of  Angola .     Democracy   In 1990 the  National Party  government took the first step towards negotiating itself out of power when it lifted the ban on the  African National Congress  and other  left-wing  political organisations, and released  Nelson Mandela  from prison after twenty-seven years' incarceration on a  sabotage  sentence. Apartheid legislation was gradually removed from the statute books, and South Africa also destroyed its nuclear arsenal and acceded to the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . The first  multi-racial elections  were held in 1994, which the ANC won by an overwhelming majority. It has been in power ever since.   In  post-apartheid South Africa , millions of South Africans, mostly black, continued to live in  poverty , though poverty among whites, previously rare, has increased greatly. [ 16 ]  While some have partly attributed this to the legacy of the apartheid system, increasingly many attribute it to the failure of the current government to tackle social issues, coupled with the monetary and fiscal discipline of the current government to ensure both redistribution of wealth and economic growth. Since the ANC-led government took power, the  United Nations   Human Development Index  of South Africa has fallen, while it was steadily rising until the mid-1990s. [ 17 ]  Some of this could possibly be attributed to the  AIDS   pandemic  and the failure of the government to take steps to address it, [ 18 ] some of it can also be pinpointed to a government policy of  redistribution of wealth . As a mitigating factor, the social housing policy of the current government has produced an improvement in living conditions.     Politics   Main articles:  Politics of South Africa ,  Government of South Africa , and  Law of South Africa          The  Union Buildings  in  Pretoria  is the home of the South African executive.       South Africa has three capital cities:  Cape Town , the largest of the three, is the  legislative  capital;  Pretoria  is the  administrative  capital; and  Bloemfontein  is the  judicial  capital. South Africa has a  bicameral   parliament : the  National Council of Provinces  (the  upper house ) has 90 members, while the  National Assembly  (the  lower house ) has 400 members. Members of the lower house are elected on a population basis by  proportional representation : half of the members are elected from national lists and the other half are elected from provincial lists. Ten members are elected to represent each province in the National Council of Provinces, regardless of the population of the province. Elections for both chambers are held every five years. The government is formed in the lower house, and the leader of the majority party in the National Assembly is the  President .   The primary sources of South Africa law are Roman-Dutch mercantile law and personal law with English Common law, as imports of Dutch settlements and  British colonialism . [ 19 ]  The first European based law in South Africa was brought by the  Dutch East India Company  and is called  Roman-Dutch law . It was imported before the  codification  of European law into the  Napoleonic Code  and is comparable in many ways to  Scots law . This was followed in the 19th century by  English law , both  common  and  statutory . Starting in 1910 with unification, South Africa had its own  parliament  which passed laws specific for South Africa, building on those previously passed for the individual member colonies.   Current South African politics are dominated by the  African National Congress  (ANC), which received 69.7% of the vote during the last  2004 general election  and 66.3% of the vote in the  2006 municipal election . The current  President of South Africa  is  Kgalema Motlanthe , who replaced  Thabo Mbeki  on 25 September 2008. Mbeki succeeded former President  Nelson Mandela  in 1999, and was re-elected for a second five year term in 2004, but announced his resignation on 20 September 2008.   The main challenger to the rule of the ANC is the  Democratic Alliance  party, which received 12.4% of the vote in the 2004 election and 14.8% in the 2006 election.  Helen Zille , (elected 6 May 2007), is the party leader; the previous leader was  Tony Leon . The formerly dominant  New National Party , which introduced apartheid through its predecessor, the  National Party , chose to merge with the ANC on 9 April 2005. Other major political parties represented in Parliament are the  Inkatha Freedom Party , which mainly represents  Zulu  voters, and the  Independent Democrats , who took 6.97% and 1.7% of the vote respectively, in the 2004 election.   Since 2004, the country has had many thousands of popular protests, some violent, making it, according to one academic, the ""most protest-rich country in the world"". [ 20 ]  Many of these protests have been organised from the growing  shanty towns  that surround South African cities.     Foreign relations and military   Main articles:  South African National Defence Force ,  Foreign relations of South Africa , and  South Africa and weapons of mass destruction   Since the end of apartheid, the South African foreign policy has focused on its African partners particularly in the  Southern African Development Community  (SADC) and the  African Union . South Africa has played a key role as a mediator in African conflicts over the last decade, such as in  Burundi , the  Democratic Republic of Congo , the  Comoros , and  Zimbabwe . After apartheid ended, South Africa was readmitted to the  Commonwealth of Nations . As the  Union of South Africa , South Africa was a founding member of the  United Nations  and the then Prime Minister  Jan Smuts  wrote the preamble to its constitution. South Africa is currently a non-permanent member of the  United Nations Security Council  and has attracted controversy by voting against a resolution criticising the  Burmese  government in 2006 and against the implementation of sanctions against  Zimbabwe  in 2008. South Africa is a member of the  Group of 77  and chaired the organisation in 2006. South Africa is a member of the  South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone ,  Southern African Customs Union ,  World Trade Organization ,  International Monetary Fund ,  G20  and  G8+5 .   The South African  armed forces , known as the  South African National Defence Force  (SANDF), was created in 1994. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  Previously known as the  South African Defence Force  (SADF), the new force is an all volunteer army and consists of the forces of the old SADF, as well as the forces of the African nationalist groups, namely  Umkhonto we Sizwe  (MK),  Azanian People's Liberation Army  (APLA), and the former  Bantustan  defence forces. [ 21 ]  The SANDF is subdivided into four branches, the  South African Army , the  South African Air Force , the  South African Navy , and the  South African Military Health Services . [ 23 ]   In recent years, the SANDF has become a major  peacekeeping  force in Africa, [ 24 ]  and has been involved in operations in  Lesotho , the  Democratic Republic of the Congo , [ 24 ]  and  Burundi , [ 24 ]  amongst others. It has also participated as a part of multi-national  UN  peacekeeping forces.   South Africa undertook a nuclear weapons programme in the 1970s [ 25 ]  and  may have conducted  a nuclear test over the  Atlantic  in 1979. [ 26 ]  It is the only African country to have successfully  developed nuclear weapons . It has become the first country (followed by Ukraine) with nuclear capability to voluntarily renounce and dismantle its programme and in the process signed the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty  in 1991. [ 25 ]     Provinces, districts and municipalities   Main articles:  Provinces of South Africa ,  Districts of South Africa , and  Municipalities of South Africa          Map showing the provinces and districts (numbered) of South Africa.             Northern Cape          North West          Gauteng          Limpopo          Mpumalanga            KwaZulu-Natal          Eastern Cape          Free State          Western Cape               When apartheid ended in 1994, the South African government had to integrate the formerly independent and semi-independent  Bantustans  into the political structure of South Africa. To this end, it abolished the four former provinces of South Africa ( Cape Province ,  Natal ,  Orange Free State , and  Transvaal ) and replaced them with nine fully integrated provinces. The new provinces are usually much smaller than the former provinces, which theoretically gives local governments more resources to distribute over smaller areas.   The nine provinces are further subdivided into  52 districts :  6 metropolitan  and  46 district municipalities . The 46 district municipalities are further subdivided into  231 local municipalities . The district municipalities also contain 20 district management areas (mostly game parks) that are directly governed by the district municipalities. The six metropolitan municipalities perform the functions of both district and local municipalities.

At 470,979  sq mi  (1,219,912 km), [ 27 ]  South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world (after  Mali ). It is comparable in size to  Colombia .  Njesuthi  in the  Drakensberg  at 3,408 m (11,424 ft) is the highest peak in South Africa.          View of the  Drakensberg mountains , the highest mountain range in South Africa.       South Africa has a generally  temperate climate , due in part to it being surrounded by the  Atlantic  and  Indian Oceans  on three sides, by its location in the climatically milder  southern hemisphere  and due to the average elevation rising steadily towards the north (towards the  equator ) and further inland. Due to this varied topography and oceanic influence, a great variety of climatic zones exist.   The climatic zones vary, from the extreme  desert  of the southern  Namib  in the farthest northwest to the lush  subtropical  climate in the east along the  Mozambique  border and the  Indian  ocean. From the east, the land quickly rises over a  mountainous   escarpment  towards the interior  plateau  known as the  Highveld . Even though South Africa is classified as  semi-arid , there is considerable variation in  climate  as well as  topography .   The interior of South Africa is a vast, rather flat, and sparsely populated  scrubland ,  Karoo , which is drier towards the northwest along the Namib desert. In contrast, the eastern coastline is lush and well-watered, which produces a climate similar to the tropics. The extreme southwest has a climate remarkably similar to that of the  Mediterranean  with wet winters and hot, dry summers, hosting the famous  Fynbos   Biome . This area also produces much of the  wine  in South Africa. This region is also particularly known for its wind, which blows intermittently almost all year. The severity of this wind made passing around the  Cape of Good Hope  particularly treacherous for sailors, causing many  shipwrecks . Further east on the south coast, rainfall is distributed more evenly throughout the year, producing a green landscape. This area is popularly known as the  Garden Route .          Satellite picture of South Africa       The  Free State  is particularly flat due to the fact that it lies centrally on the high plateau. North of the  Vaal River , the Highveld becomes better watered and does not experience subtropical extremes of heat.  Johannesburg , in the centre of the Highveld, is at 1,740 metres (5,709 ft) and receives an annual rainfall of 760 millimetres (30  in ). Winters in this region are cold, although  snow  is rare.   To the north of Johannesburg, the altitude drops beyond the escarpment of the Highveld, and turns into the lower lying Bushveld, an area of mixed dry forest and an abundance of wildlife. East of the Highveld, beyond the eastern escarpment, the Lowveld stretches towards the  Indian  ocean. It has particularly high temperatures, and is also the location of extended subtropical agriculture.   The high  Drakensberg mountains , which form the south-eastern escarpment of the Highveld, offer limited  skiing  opportunities in winter. The coldest place in South Africa is  Sutherland  in the western  Roggeveld Mountains , where midwinter temperatures can reach as low as 15 degrees  Celsius  (5  F ). The deep interior has the hottest temperatures: A temperature of 51.7 C (125 F) was recorded in 1948 in the  Northern Cape  Kalahari near  Upington . [ 28 ]   South Africa also has one possession, the small sub-Antarctic archipelago of the  Prince Edward Islands , consisting of  Marion Island  (290 km/112 sq mi) and Prince Edward Island (45 km/17.3 sq mi) (not to be confused with the  Canadian province of the same name ).           Weather averages for Cape Town, South Africa         Month   Jan   Feb   Mar   Apr   May   Jun   Jul   Aug   Sep   Oct   Nov   Dec   Year       Average high C (F)   27  (81)   28  (82)   26  (79)   24  (75)   20  (68)   18  (64)   17  (63)   18  (64)   19  (66)   22  (72)   24  (75)   26  (79)   28  (82)       Average low C (F)   16  (61)   16  (61)   15  (59)   13  (55)   10  (50)   8  (46)   8  (46)   8  (46)   9  (48)   11  (52)   14  (57)   15  (59)   8  (46)       Precipitation  mm (inches)   16.5  (0.65)   13  (0.51)   20  (0.79)   54  (2.13)   92  (3.62)   111  (4.37)   96  (3.78)   87  (3.43)   56  (2.2)   40  (1.57)   24  (0.94)   18  (0.71)   627  (24.69)       Source: EuroWEATHER [ 29 ]  2008-02-22         Flora and fauna   See also:  Wildlife of South Africa   See also:  Protected areas of South Africa           Fynbos , a  floral kingdom  unique to South Africa, is found near  Cape Town               Swartberg  mountains near the town of  Oudtshoorn              A field of flowers in Weskus National Park.       South Africa is one of only 17 countries worldwide considered  megadiverse . It has more than 20,000 different  plants , or about 10% of all the known  species  of plants on  Earth , making it particularly rich in plant biodiversity. South Africa is the 6th most biodiverse country, [ 30 ]  after  Brazil ,  Colombia ,  Indonesia ,  China , and  Mexico . The most prevalent biome in South Africa is the  grassland , particularly on the  Highveld , where the plant cover is dominated by different  grasses , low  shrubs , and  acacia trees , mainly camel-thorn and whitethorn.  Vegetation  becomes even more sparse towards the northwest due to low  rainfall . There are several species of water-storing  succulents  like  aloes  and euphorbias in the very hot and dry  Namaqualand  area. The grass and thorn  savannah  turns slowly into a bush savannah towards the north-east of the country, with denser growth. There are significant numbers of  baobab  trees in this area, near the northern end of  Kruger National Park . [ 31 ]   The  Fynbos   Biome , which makes up the majority of the area and plant life in the  Cape floristic region , one of the six  floral kingdoms , is located in a small region of the  Western Cape  and contains more than 9,000 of those species, making it among the richest regions on earth in terms of floral biodiversity. The majority of the plants are  evergreen  hard-leaf plants with fine, needle-like  leaves , such as the  sclerophyllous  plants. Another uniquely South African plant is the  protea  genus of flowering plants. There are around 130 different species of protea in South Africa.   While South Africa has a great wealth of flowering plants, it has few  forests . Only 1% of South Africa is forest, almost exclusively in the  humid   coastal plain  along the  Indian Ocean  in  KwaZulu-Natal  (see  KwaZulu-Cape coastal forest mosaic ). There are even smaller reserves of forests that are out of the reach of  fire , known as montane forests (see  Knysna-Amatole montane forests ).  Plantations  of imported tree species are predominant, particularly the non-native  eucalyptus  and  pine . South Africa has lost a large area of natural habitat in the last four decades, primarily due to  overpopulation , sprawling development patterns and  deforestation  during the nineteenth century. South Africa is one of the worst affected countries in the world when it comes to invasion by alien species with many (e.g.  Black Wattle ,  Port Jackson ,  Hakea ,  Lantana  and  Jacaranda ) posing a significant threat to the native  biodiversity  and the already scarce water resources. The original  temperate forest  that met the first European settlers to South Africa was exploited ruthlessly until only small patches remained. Currently, South African  hardwood  trees like  Real Yellowwood   (Podocarpus latifolius) ,  stinkwood   (Ocotea bullata) , and South African  Black Ironwood   (Olea laurifolia)  are under government protection.   Numerous  mammals  are found in the  bushveld  habitats including  lions ,  leopards ,  white rhinos ,  blue wildebeest ,  kudus ,  impalas ,  hyenas ,  hippopotamus  and  giraffes . A significant extent of the bushveld habitat exists in the north-east including  Kruger National Park  and the  Mala Mala  Reserve, as well as in the far north in the  Waterberg Biosphere .   Climate change is expected to bring considerable warming and drying to much of this already semi-arid region, with greater frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, flooding and drought. According to computer generated climate modelling produced by the South African National Biodiversity Institute [ 32 ]  parts of southern Africa will see an increase in temperature by about one degree Celsius along the coast to more than four degrees Celsius in the already hot hinterland such as the  Northern Cape  in late spring and summertime by 2050.   The Cape Floral Kingdom has been identified as one of the global  biodiversity hotspots  since it will be hit very hard by  climate change  and has such a great diversity of life. Drought, increased intensity and frequency of fire and climbing temperatures are expected to push many of these  rare species  towards  extinction .   South Africa houses many endemic species, among them the  critically endangered   Riverine Rabbit  ( Bunolagus monticullaris ) in the  Karoo .     Economy   Main article:  Economy of South Africa          The  Victoria & Alfred Waterfront  in  Cape Town  with  Table Mountain  in the background. Cape Town has become an important  retail  and  tourism  centre for the country, and attracts the largest number of foreign visitors in South Africa       By  UN  classification South Africa is a middle-income country with an abundant supply of resources, well-developed financial, legal, communications, energy, and transport sectors, a  stock exchange  (the  JSE Limited ), that ranks among the top twenty in the world, and a modern infrastructure supporting an efficient distribution of goods to major urban centres throughout the entire region. South Africa is ranked 25th in the world in terms of  GDP  (PPP) as of 2007.   Advanced development is significantly localised around four areas: Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Durban, and Pretoria/Johannesburg. Beyond these four economic centres, development is marginal and poverty is still prevalent despite government efforts. Consequently the vast majority of South Africans are poor. However, key marginal areas have experienced rapid growth recently. Such areas include Mossel Bay to Plettenberg Bay; Rustenburg area; Nelspruit area; Bloemfontein; Cape West Coast; and the KwaZulu-Natal North Coast.   Even though South Africa has the seventh highest per capita income in Africa, only behind  Libya ,  Mauritius  it suffers from large income gaps and a  dual economy  marking it as a  developing country . South Africa has one of the highest rates of  income inequality  in the world. A decade of continual economic growth has helped to lower unemployment, but daunting economic and social problems remain. The average South African household income decreased considerably between 1995 and 2000. As for racial inequality,  Statistics South Africa  reported that in 1995 the average white household earned four times as much as the average black household. In 2000 the average white household was earning six times more than the average black household. [ 33 ]  The  affirmative action  policies have seen a rise in black economic wealth and an emerging black middle class. [ 34 ]  Other problems are crime, corruption, and  HIV / AIDS .   At the start of 2000, then President Thabo Mbeki vowed to promote economic growth and foreign investment by relaxing restrictive labour laws, stepping up the pace of  privatisation , and cutting unneeded governmental spending. His policies face strong opposition from organised  labour . South Africa is also the largest energy producer and consumer on the continent. South Africa is a popular tourist destination, and a substantial amount of revenue comes from tourism. [ 35 ]  Among the main attractions are the diverse and picturesque culture, the game reserves and the highly regarded local wines.   The South African  rand  (ZAR), is the most actively traded emerging  market currency  in the world. It has joined an elite club of fifteen currencies, the  Continuous linked settlement  (CLS), where forex transactions are settled immediately, lowering the risks of transacting across  time zones . The rand was the best-performing currency against the  United States dollar  (USD) between 2002 and 2005, according to the  Bloomberg  Currency Scorecard.   The volatility of the  rand  has affected economic activity, falling sharply during 2001 and hitting a historic low of 13.85  ZAR  to the  USD , raising fears of inflation, and causing the Reserve Bank to increase  interest rates . The rand has since recovered, trading at 7.13 ZAR to the dollar as of January 2008. However, as exporters are put under considerable pressure from a stronger domestic currency, many call for government intervention to help soften the rand.   Refugees from poorer neighbouring countries include many immigrants from the DRC, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Malawi and others, representing a large portion of the informal sector. With high unemployment levels amongst poorer South Africans,  xenophobia  is prevalent and many people born in South Africa feel resentful of immigrants who are seen to be depriving the native population of jobs, a feeling which has been given credibility by the fact that many South African employers have employed migrants from other countries for lower pay than South African citizens, especially in the  construction ,  tourism ,  agriculture  and  domestic service  industries. Illegal immigrants are also heavily involved in informal trading. [ 36 ]  However, many immigrants to South Africa continue to live in poor conditions, and the South African immigration policy has become increasingly restrictive since 1994. [ 37 ]   Principal international trading partners of South Africa  besides other African countries  include  Germany , the  United States ,  China ,  Japan , the  United Kingdom  and  Spain .  [ 38 ]  Chief exports include  corn ,  diamonds ,  fruits ,  gold ,  metals  and  minerals ,  sugar , and  wool .  Machinery  and transportation equipment make up more than one-third of the value of the countrys imports. Other imports include  chemicals , manufactured goods, and  petroleum .     Electricity crisis   After unsuccessful attempts by the government to encourage private construction of electricity generation capacity, in 2007 the state-owned electricity supplier ( Eskom ) started experiencing a lack of capacity in the electrical generating and reticulation infrastructure. This led to an inability to meet the routine demands of industry and consumers, resulting in countrywide  rolling blackouts . Initially the lack of capacity was triggered by a failure at  Koeberg nuclear power station , but since then a general lack of capacity became evident. The supplier has been widely criticised for failing to adequately plan for and construct sufficient electrical generating capacity, [ 39 ]  although ultimately the government has admitted that it is at fault for refusing to approve funding for investment in infrastructure. [ 40 ]     Agriculture          Workers planting on a farm in the central area of  Mpumalanga .               Farm  workers.       South Africa has a large agricultural sector and is a net exporter of  farming  products. There are almost a thousand  agricultural cooperatives  and  agribusinesses  throughout the country, and agricultural exports have constituted 8% of South African total exports for the past five years. The agricultural industry contributes around 10% of formal employment, relatively low compared to other parts of Africa, as well as providing work for casual labourers and contributing around 2.6% of  GDP  for the nation. [ 41 ]  However, due to the  aridity  of the land, only 13.5% can be used for crop production, and only 3% is considered high potential land. [ 42 ]   Although the commercial farming sector is relatively well developed, people in some rural areas still survive on  subsistence agriculture . It is the eighth largest wine producer in the world, and the eleventh largest producer of sunflower seed. South Africa is a net exporter of agricultural products and foodstuffs, the largest number of exported items being  sugar ,  grapes ,  citrus ,  nectarines ,  wine  and  deciduous  fruit. The largest locally produced crop is  maize  (corn), and it has been estimated that 9 million tons are produced every year, with 7.4 million tons being consumed.  Livestock  are also popular on South African farms, with the country producing 85% of all meat consumed. The dairy industry consists of around 4,300 milk producers providing employment for 60,000 farm workers and contributing to the livelihoods of around 40,000 others. [ 43 ]   In recent years, the agricultural sector has introduced several reforms, some of which are controversial, such as  land reform  and the deregulation of the market for agricultural products. Land reform has been criticised both by farmers' groups and by landless workers, the latter alleging that the pace of change has not been fast enough, and the former alleging racist treatment and expressing concerns that a similar situation to  Zimbabwe's land reform policy  may develop, [ 44 ]  a fear exacerbated by comments made by  deputy president , the deputy president of South Africa. [ 45 ] [ 46 ]  The sector continues to face problems, with increased foreign competition and crime being two of the major challenges for the industry. The government has been accused of either putting in too much effort [ 47 ] , or not enough effort [ 48 ] , to tackle the problem of  farm attacks  as opposed to other forms of violent crime.   Another issue which affects South African agriculture is environmental damage caused by misuse of the land and global climate change. South Africa is unusually vulnerable to climate change and resultant diminution of surface waters. Some predictions show surface water supply could decrease by 60% by the year 2070 in parts of the Western Cape. [ 49 ]  To reverse the damage caused by land mismanagement, the government has supported a scheme which promotes  sustainable development  and the use of natural resources. [ 50 ]  Maize production, which contributes to a 36% majority of the gross value of South Africas field crops, has also experienced negative effects due to climate change. The estimated value of loss, which takes into consideration scenarios with and without the carbon dioxide fertilisation effect  [2]  ,ranges between 10s to 100s of millions of Rands.

South Africa is a nation of more than 48 million people of diverse origins,  cultures ,  languages , and  religions . The last  census  was held in 2001 and the next will be in 2011.  Statistics South Africa  provided five  racial  categories by which people could classify themselves, the last of which, ""unspecified/other"" drew negligible responses, and these results were omitted. [ 52 ]  The 2006 midyear estimated figures for the other categories were  Black African  at 79.5%,  White  at 9.2%,  Coloured  at 8.9%, and  Indian or Asian  at 2.5%. [ 53 ]  Even though the population of South Africa has increased in the past decade [ 52 ] [ 54 ]  (primarily due to immigration), the country had an annual population growth rate of 0.501% in 2008 (CIA est.), including immigration. [ 55 ]  South Africa is home to an estimated 5 million  illegal immigrants , including some 3 million  Zimbabweans . [ 56 ] [ 57 ] [ 58 ]  A series of  anti-immigrant riots  occurred in South Africa beginning on 11 May 2008. [ 59 ] [ 60 ]   By far the major part of the population classified itself as African or black, but it is not culturally or linguistically homogeneous. Major ethnic groups include the  Zulu ,  Xhosa ,  Basotho  (South Sotho),  Bapedi  (North Sotho),  Venda ,  Tswana ,  Tsonga ,  Swazi  and  Ndebele , all of which speak  Bantu languages  (see  Bantu peoples of South Africa ).   Some, such as the Zulu, Xhosa, Bapedi and Venda groups, are unique to South Africa. Other groups are distributed across the borders with neighbours of South Africa: The  Basotho  group is also the major ethnic group in  Lesotho . The  Tswana  ethnic group constitute the majority of the population of  Botswana . The  Swazi  ethnic group is the major ethnic group in  Swaziland . The  Ndebele  ethnic group is also found in  Matabeleland  in  Zimbabwe , where they are known as the  Matabele . These Ndebele people are the descendants of a Zulu faction under the warrior  Mzilikazi  that escaped persecution from  Shaka  by migrating to their current territory. The  Tsonga  ethnic group is also found in southern  Mozambique , where they are known as the Shangaan.   The white population is not ethnically homogeneous and descend from many ethnic groups:  Dutch ,  Flemish ,  Portuguese , German, French  Huguenot , English, Irish, Italian, Scottish and  Welsh . Culturally and linguistically, they are divided into the  Afrikaners , who speak  Afrikaans , and English-speaking groups, many of whom are descended from British and Irish immigrants (see  Anglo-African ). Many small communities that have immigrated over the last century retain the use of other languages. The  white population  is on the decrease due to a low birth rate and emigration; as a factor in their decision to emigrate, many cite the high  crime  rate and the  affirmative action  policies of the government. Since 1994, approximately 1 000 000 white South Africans have permanently emigrated. [ 61 ] [ 62 ] [ 63 ] [ 64 ]  Despite high emigration levels, a high level of non-South African white immigrants have settled in the country, in particular from countries such as  Britain  and  Zimbabwe . For example, by 2005, an estimated 212 000 British citizens were residing in South Africa. Since 2003, the numbers of British migrants coming to South Africa has risen by 50%. An estimated 20 000 British migrants moved to South Africa in 2007. There have also been a significant number of  white Zimbabwean  arrivals, fleeing their home country in light of the economic and political problems currently facing the country. As well as recent arrivals, a significant number of white Zimbabweans emigrated to South Africa in the wake of independence in Zimbabwe in 1980. Some of the more nostalgic members of the community are known in popular culture as "" Whenwes "", because of their nostalgia for their lives in  Rhodesia  ""when we were in Rhodesia"". [ 65 ]   The term  Coloured  is still largely used for the people of mixed race descended from slaves brought in from East and Central Africa, the indigenous  Khoisan  who lived in the  Cape  at the time, Bantus, Whites (mostly the  Dutch / Afrikaner  and British settlers) as well as an admixture of  Javanese ,  Malay , Indian,  Malagasy  and Asian blood (such as  Burmese ). The majority speak Afrikaans. Khoisan is a term used to describe two separate groups, physically similar: light-skinned and small in stature. The  Khoikhoi , who were called  Hottentots  by the Europeans, were pastoralists and were annihilated; the San, called  Bushmen  by the Europeans, were hunter-gatherers. Within the Coloured community, more recent immigrants will also be found: Coloureds from the former  Rhodesia  (now  Zimbabwe );  Namibia  and immigrants of mixed descent from India and  Burma  ( Anglo-Indians / Anglo-Burmese ) who were welcomed to the Cape when India and Burma received their Independence.   The major part of the South African  Asian  population is Indian in origin (see  Indian South Africans ); many of them descended from indentured workers brought in the nineteenth century to work on the  sugar   plantations  of the eastern coastal area then known as  Natal . There is also a significant group of  Chinese South Africans  (approximately 100,000 individuals) and  Vietnamese  South Africans (approximately 50,000 individuals). In 2008, the Pretoria High Court has ruled that Chinese South Africans who arrived before 1994 are to be reclassified as  Coloureds . As a result of this ruling, about 12,000 - 15,000  [ 66 ] ethnically Chinese citizens who arrived before 1994, numbering 3%-5% of the total Chinese population in the country, will be able to benefit from government  BEE  policies. [ 67 ]   South Africa hosts a sizeable refugee and asylum seeker population. According to the  World Refugee Survey 2008 , published by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, this population numbered approximately 144,700 in 2007. [ 68 ]  Groups of refugees and asylum seekers numbering over 10,000 included people from  Zimbabwe  (48,400), The  Democratic Republic of the Congo  (24,800), and  Somalia  (12,900). [ 68 ]  These populations mainly lived in Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban, Cape Town, and Port Elizabeth. [ 68 ]     Science and technology   Several important scientific and technological developments have originated in South Africa.  The first human to human heart transplant was performed by cardiac surgeon  Christiaan Barnard  at  Groote Schuur Hospital  in December 1967  .  Max Theiler  developed a vaccine against Yellow Fever,  Allan McLeod Cormack  pioneered x-ray  Computed tomography , and  Aaron Klug  developed crystallographic electron microscopy techniques. These advancements were all recognised with  Nobel Prizes .  Sydney Brenner  won most recently, in 2002, for his pioneering work in  molecular biology .   Mark Shuttleworth  founded an early Internet security company  Thawte , that was subsequently bought out by world-leader  VeriSign . Despite government efforts to encourage entrepreneurship in biotechnology, IT and other high technology fields, no other notable groundbreaking companies have been founded in South Africa. However, it is the expressed objective of the government to transition the economy to be more reliant on high technology, based on the realisation that South African cannot compete with Far Eastern economies in manufacturing, nor can the republic rely on its mineral wealth in perpetuity.   South Africa has cultivated a burgeoning astronomy community. It hosts the  Southern African Large Telescope , the largest optical telescope in the southern hemisphere. South Africa is currently building the  Karoo Array Telescope  as a pathfinder for the $20 billion  Square Kilometer Array  project. South Africa is a finalist, with Australia, to be the host of the SKA.     Society and culture   Main article:  Culture of South Africa          Decorated houses,  Drakensberg Mountains              Traditional  South African cuisine .       It may be argued that there is no ""single"" culture in South Africa because of its ethnic diversity. Today, the diversity in foods from many cultures is enjoyed by all and especially marketed to tourists who wish to sample the large variety of South African cuisine. In addition to  food ,  music  and  dance  feature prominently.   South African cuisine  is heavily  meat-based  and has spawned the distinctively South African social gathering known as a  braai , or barbecue. South Africa has also developed into a major  wine  producer, with some of the best  vineyards  lying in valleys around  Stellenbosch ,  Franschoek ,  Paarl  and  Barrydale . [ 69 ]   There is great diversity in music from South Africa. Many black musicians who sang in Afrikaans or English during apartheid have since begun to sing in traditional African languages, and have developed a unique style called  Kwaito . Of note is  Brenda Fassie , who launched to fame with her song ""Weekend Special"", which was sung in English. More famous traditional musicians include  Ladysmith Black Mambazo , while the  Soweto String Quartet  performs classic music with an African flavour. White and Coloured South African singers are historically influenced by European musical styles including such western metal bands such as  Seether  (formerly Saron Gas). South Africa has produced world-famous jazz musicians, notably  Hugh Masekela ,  Jonas Gwangwa ,  Abdullah Ibrahim ,  Miriam Makeba ,  Jonathan Butler ,  Chris McGregor , and  Sathima Bea Benjamin .  Afrikaans  music covers multiple genres, such as the  contemporary   Steve Hofmeyr  and the  punk rock  band  Fokofpolisiekar . Crossover artists such as  Johnny Clegg  and his bands  Juluka  and  Savuka  have enjoyed various success underground, publicly, and abroad.   The South African black majority still has a substantial number of rural inhabitants who lead largely impoverished lives. It is among these people, however, that cultural traditions survive most strongly; as blacks have become increasingly  urbanised  and  westernised , aspects of traditional culture have declined. Urban blacks usually speak English or  Afrikaans  in addition to their native tongue. There are smaller but still significant groups of speakers of  Khoisan languages  who are not included in the eleven official languages, but are one of the eight other officially recognised languages. There are small groups of speakers of  endangered languages , most of which are from the Khoi-San family, that receive no official status; however, some groups within South Africa are attempting to promote their use and revival.   The  middle class  lifestyle, predominantly of the white minority but with growing numbers of Black, Coloured and Indian people, [ 70 ]  is similar in many respects to that of people found in  Western Europe , North America and  Australasia . Members of the middle class often study and work abroad for greater exposure to the markets of the world.   Asians , predominantly of Indian origin, preserve their own cultural heritage, languages and religious beliefs, being either  Christian ,  Hindu  or  Sunni Muslim  and speaking English, with Indian languages like  Hindi ,  Telugu ,  Tamil  or  Gujarati  being spoken less frequently, but the majority of Indians being able to understand their mother tongue. The first Indians arrived on the famous  Truro ship  as  indentured labourers  in Natal to work the Sugar Cane Fields. There is a much smaller  Chinese  community in South Africa, although its numbers have increased due to immigration from  Republic of China  (Taiwan).   South Africa has also had a large influence in the  Scouting  movement, with many Scouting traditions and ceremonies coming from the experiences of  Robert Baden-Powell  (the founder of Scouting) during his time in South Africa as a military officer in the 1890s. The  South African Scout Association  was one of the first youth organisations to open its doors to youth and adults of all races in South Africa. This happened on 2 July 1977 at a conference known as  Quo Vadis . [ 71 ]   The South African music scene consists of  Kwaito , a new music genre that had developed in the mid 80s and has since developed to become the most popular social economical form of representation among the populous. Though some may argue that the political aspects of Kwaito has since diminished after  Apartheid , and the relative interest in politics has become a minor aspect of daily life. Some argue that in a sense,  Kwaito  is in fact a political force that shows activism in its apolitical actions. Today, major corporations like  Sony ,  BMG , and  EMI  have appeared on the South African scene to produce and distribute  Kwaito  music. Due to its overwhelming popularity, as well as the general influence of DJs, who are among the top 5 most influential types of people within the country,  Kwaito  has taken over radio, television, and magazines. [ 72 ]   Kwaito , much like most hip-hop has its own local flavor and originality. However, unlike when hip-hop first burst on the scene as a politically driven and rebellious underground movement, South Africans wanted to create a happier vibe. As the post-apartheid fog cleared, South African youth found their ""own voice in a style of music known as kwaito, spawning a new (and profitable) industry"". [ 73 ]  According to TIMEeurope magazine, ""The kwaito sound now regularly incorporates traditional African music, jazz, gospel, and even rock guitar, most notably on Mandoza's 2000 hit Nkalakatha, one of the few kwaito records to cross over onto traditionally white radio"". [ 74 ]  In the kwaito, the samples from old school  Jamaican dancehall , European house, etc.,  tempos  are changed, beats are added, and urban street slang is also incorporated. This local flavour of music more recently has been attacked for its lack of ingenuity and its betrayal of its roots. The melodies and the incorporation of sex and dance have since become very similar to the American standard. In addition Kwaito has been criticised for its absence of influential lyrical content. As Kwaito is still a developing genre, and since the South African population is only around 48 million, sales of only 25,000 CDs are required for ""gold"" certification in South Africa. [ 73 ]     Religion   Main article:  Religion in South Africa           St. Mark 's Anglican Cathedral.       According to the latest 2001 national census, Christians accounted for 79.7% of the population. This includes  Zion Christian  11.1%,  Pentecostal  ( Charismatic ) 8.2%,  Roman Catholic  7.1%,  Methodist  6.8%,  Dutch Reformed  6.7%,  Anglican  3.8%, and other Christian 36%.  Islam  accounted for 1.5% of the population,  Hinduism  about 1.3%, and  Judaism  0.2%. 15.1% had no religious affiliation, 2.3% were other and 1.4% were unspecified. [ 75 ] [ 76 ]   African Indigenous Churches were the largest of the  Christian  groups. It was believed that many of these persons who claimed no affiliation with any organised religion adhered to  traditional indigenous religions . Many peoples have  syncretic  religious practices combining Christian and indigenous influences. [ 77 ]   Islam in South Africa  itself is not known to pre-date the colonial period, despite the isolated contact neighbouring  Mozambique  had with  Arab  and  East African  traders. [ citation needed ]  There is no evidence that Islam was known to the  Zulu ,  Swazi , or  Xhosa  of the east coast prior to the colonial era. Many South African Muslims are described as  Coloureds , notably in the  Western Cape , especially those whose ancestors came as slaves from the Indonesian archipelago (the  Cape Malays ). Others are described as  Indians , notably in  KwaZulu-Natal , including those whose ancestors came as traders from  South Asia ; they have been joined by others from other parts of Africa as well as white or black South African converts. It is estimated that  Islam  is the fastest growing religion of conversion in the country, [ 78 ]  with the number of black  Muslims  growing sixfold, from 12,000 in 1991 to 74,700 in 2004. [ 79 ]   Hinduism  dates back to British Colonial period primarily but later waves of continuous immigrants from India have contributed to a sizeable Hindu population. Most Hindus are ethnically South Asian but there are many who come from mixed racial stock and many are converts with the efforts of Hindu missionaries such as ISKCON. Other religions in smaller numbers are  Sikhism ,  Jainism  and  Bah' Faith . [ 76 ]     Languages   Main article:  Languages of South Africa          Map showing principal South African languages by municipality. Lighter shades indicate a non-majority  plurality .             Afrikaans          Northern Sotho          Southern Sotho          Swati          Tsonga            Tswana          Venda          Xhosa          Zulu               South Africa has eleven  official languages : [ 80 ]   Sepedi ,  Sesotho ,  Setswana ,  siSwati ,  Tshivenda ,  Xitsonga ,  Afrikaans ,  English ,  isiNdebele ,  isiXhosa  and  isiZulu . In this regard it is  second only to India  in number. While each language is formally equal to every other, some languages are spoken more than others. According to the 2001 National Census, the three most spoken first home languages are Zulu (23.8%), Xhosa (17.6%) and Afrikaans (13.3%). [ 52 ]  Despite the fact that English is recognised as the language of commerce and science, it was spoken by only 8.2% of South Africans at home in 2001, an even lower percentage than in 1996 (8.6%). [ 52 ]   There are  eleven official names  for South Africa, one in each of the official national languages. The country also recognises eight non-official languages:  Fanagalo ,  Khoe ,  Lobedu ,  Nama ,  Northern Ndebele ,  Phuthi ,  San  and  South African Sign Language . [ citation needed ]  These non-official languages may be used in certain official uses in limited areas where it has been determined that these languages are prevalent. Nevertheless, their populations are not such that they require nationwide recognition.   Many of the ""unofficial languages"" of the  San  and  Khoikhoi  people contain regional  dialects  stretching northward into Namibia and Botswana, and elsewhere. These people, who are a physically distinct population from other Africans, have their own cultural identity based on their  hunter-gatherer  societies. They have been marginalised to a great extent, and many of their languages are in danger of becoming  extinct .   Many white South Africans also speak other European languages, such as  Portuguese  (also spoken by Angolan and Mozambican blacks), German, and  Greek , while some  Asians  and  Indians  in South Africa speak  South Asian  languages, such as  Tamil ,  Hindi ,  Gujarati ,  Urdu  and  Telugu .  French  is still widely spoken by French South Africans especially in places like  Franschhoek , where many South Africans are of French origin. South African French is spoken by less than 10,000 individuals. Congolese French is also spoken in South Africa by migrants.

Unverifiable  material may be challenged and removed.  (June 2008)       The main sports in South Africa are  soccer ,  rugby ,  cricket ,  boxing  and  lawn bowls . Other sports with significant support are  swimming ,  golf  and  netball .  Basketball ,  surfing  and  skateboarding  are popular among the youth.   Famous boxing personalities include Baby Jake  Jacob Matlala ,  Vuyani Bungu ,  Welcome Ncita ,  Dingaan Thobela ,  Gerrie Coetzee  and  Brian Mitchell . Football players who have excelled in international clubs include  Lucas Radebe  of  Leeds United  and  Quinton Fortune , formerly of  Manchester United ,  Benni McCarthy  and  Aaron Mokoena  of  Blackburn Rovers  and  Steven Pienaar  of  Everton . South Africa produced  Formula 1  motor racing's 1979 world champion  Jody Scheckter .   South Africa hosted and won the  1995 Rugby World Cup  at their first attempt and again won the  2007 Rugby World Cup  in  France . South Africa was only allowed to participate from 1995 since the end of  Apartheid . It followed the 1995 Rugby World Cup by hosting and winning the  1996 African Cup of Nations  football tournament. It also hosted the  2003 Cricket World Cup  and the  2007 World Twenty20 Championship . South Africa will be the host nation for the  2010 FIFA World Cup , which will be the first time the tournament is held on the African continent.   In 2004, the swim team of  Roland Schoeman ,  Lyndon Ferns ,  Darian Townsend  and  Ryk Neethling  won the gold medal at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, simultaneously breaking the world record in the 4x100 freestyle relay.  Penny Heyns  won Olympic Gold in the 1996  Atlanta Olympic Games .   In golf,  Gary Player  is generally regarded as one of the greatest golfers of all time, having won the  Career Grand Slam , one of five golfers to have done so. Other South African golfers to have successfully won a major tournament include  Bobby Locke ,  Ernie Els ,  Retief Goosen  and  Trevor Immelman .     Current issues     HIV/AIDS   Main article:  HIV/AIDS in South Africa   The spread of  AIDS  (acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome) is an alarming problem in South Africa with up to 31% of pregnant women found to be HIV infected in 2005 and the infection rate among adults estimated at 20%. [ 81 ]  The link between HIV, a virus spread primarily by sexual contact, and AIDS was long denied by prior president  Thabo Mbeki  and then health minister  Manto Tshabalala-Msimang , who insisted that the many deaths in the country are due to malnutrition, and hence poverty, and not HIV. [ 82 ]  In 2007, in response to international pressure, the government made efforts to fight AIDS. [ 83 ]  In September 2008 Thabo Mbeki was ousted by the ANC and  Kgalema Motlanthe  was appointed for the interim. One of Mr. Motlanthe's first actions was to replace Mrs. Tshabalala-Msimang with the current minister,  Barbara Hogan .   AIDS affects mainly those who are sexually active and is far more prevalent in the black population. Most deaths are people who are also economically active, resulting in many families losing their primary wage earners. This has resulted in many 'AIDS orphans' who in many cases depend on the state for care and financial support. [ 84 ]  It is estimated that there are 1,200,000 orphans in South Africa. [ 84 ]  Many elderly people also lose the support from lost younger members of their family. Roughly 5 million people are infected with the disease. [ 83 ]     Crime   Main article:  Crime in South Africa           Prison  buildings on  Robben Island       According to a survey for the period 19982000 compiled by the  United Nations , South Africa was ranked second for  murder  and first for  assaults  and  rapes  per capita. [ 85 ]  Total crime per capita is 10th out of the 60 countries in the data set.   Crime  has had a pronounced effect on society: many middle-class South Africans moved into  gated communities , abandoning the central business districts of some cities for the relative security of suburbs. This effect is most pronounced in  Johannesburg , although the trend is noticeable in other cities as well. [ citation needed ]  Many emigrants from South Africa also state that crime was a big motivator for them to leave.  Crime against the farming community  has continued to be a major problem. [ 86 ]     Skills migration   Along with many African nations, South Africa has been experiencing a "" brain drain "" in the past 20 years. This is believed to be potentially damaging for the regional economy, [ 87 ]  and is almost certainly detrimental for the well-being of the majority of people reliant on the healthcare infrastructure, given the HIV/AIDS epidemic. [ 88 ]  The skills drain in South Africa tends to demonstrate racial contours (naturally given the skills distribution legacy of South Africa) and has thus resulted in large white South African communities abroad. [ 89 ]     Xenophobia   Main article:  Xenophobia in South Africa   In May 2008 long standing state hostility to African migrants exploded in a series of pogroms that left up to 100 people dead and 100,000 displaced.

The South African coast stretches 2,798 kilometres (1,739 mi) [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  and borders both the  Atlantic  and  Indian   oceans . [ 7 ]  To the north of South Africa lie  Namibia ,  Botswana  and  Zimbabwe , to the east are  Mozambique  and  Swaziland , while the  Kingdom of Lesotho  is an independent  enclave  surrounded by South African territory. [ 8 ]   Modern human beings have inhabited South Africa for more than 100,000 years. [ 9 ]  A century and a half after the discovery of the  Cape Sea Route , the  Dutch East India Company   founded  a refreshment station at what would become  Cape Town  in 1652. [ 10 ]  Cape Town became a British colony in 1806. European settlement expanded during the 1820s as the  Boers  (original  Dutch ,  Flemish ,  German  and  French  settlers) and the British  1820 Settlers  claimed land in the north and east of the country. Conflicts arose among the Xhosa, Zulu and Afrikaner groups. However, the discovery of diamonds and later gold triggered the conflict known as the  Anglo-Boer War  as the Boers and the British fought for the control of the South African mineral wealth. Although the Boers were defeated, limited independence was given to South Africa in 1910 as a British dominion. Anti-British policies focused on ultimate independence which was achieved in 1961 when South Africa was declared a  republic . The leading  National Party  legislated for a continuation of racial segregation begun under Dutch and British colonial rule, Boer republics, and subsequent South African governments (and which in 1948 became legally institutionalised  segregation  known as  apartheid ), despite opposition both in and outside of the country. In 1990 the then president  F.W. de Klerk  began to dismantle this legislation, and in 1994 the first democratic election was held in South Africa. This election brought  Nelson Mandela  and the current ruling party, the  African National Congress  to power, and the country rejoined the  Commonwealth of Nations .   South Africa is known for its diversity in cultures, languages, and religious beliefs, and eleven official languages are recognised in its  constitution . [ 7 ]  English is the most commonly spoken language in official and commercial public life, however it is only the fifth most spoken home language. [ 7 ]  South Africa is ethnically diverse, with the largest  Caucasian ,  Indian , and  racially mixed  communities in Africa. Although 79.6% of the South African population is  Black , [ 2 ]  this category is neither culturally nor linguistically homogeneous, as people within this classification speak a number of different  Bantu languages , nine of which have official status. [ 7 ]  Midyear 2007, the South African population was estimated at 47.9 million.

(September 2008)       Main article:  History of South Africa   South Africa contains some of the oldest archaeological sites in the world. [ 11 ]   [ 12 ]  Extensive fossil remains at the  Sterkfontein ,  Kromdraai  and Makapansgat caves suggest that various  australopithecines  existed in South Africa from about three million years ago. [ 13 ]  These were succeeded by various species of  Homo , including  Homo habilis ,  Homo erectus  and modern humans,  Homo sapiens . Settlements of  Bantu -speaking peoples, who were  iron -using agriculturists and herdsmen, were already present south of the  Limpopo River  by the fourth or fifth century (see  Bantu expansion ) displacing and absorbing the original  KhoiSan  speakers. They slowly moved south and the earliest ironworks in modern-day  KwaZulu-Natal Province  are believed to date from around 1050. The southernmost group was the  Xhosa  people, whose language incorporates certain linguistic traits from the earlier KhoiSan people, reaching the  Fish River , in today's  Eastern Cape Province . These  Iron Age  populations displaced earlier people, who often had  hunter-gatherer  societies, as they migrated.     European colonisation          Painting of an account of the arrival of  Jan van Riebeeck , the first  European  to settle in South Africa, with  Devil's Peak  in the background       In 1487, the  Portuguese  explorer  Bartolomeu Dias  became the first European to reach the southernmost point of Africa. Initially named The Cape of Storms, The King of Portugal,  John II , renamed it the  Cabo da Boa Esperana  or  Cape of Good Hope  as it led to the riches of India. This great feat of navigation was later immortalised in  Cames ' epic Portuguese poem,  The Lusiads  (1572). In 1652, a refreshment station was established at the  Cape of Good Hope  by  Jan van Riebeeck  on behalf of the  Dutch East India Company .  Slaves  were brought from  Indonesia ,  Madagascar , and India as a labour source for the Dutch immigrants in  Cape Town . As they expanded east, the Dutch settlers eventually met the south-westerly expanding  Xhosa  people in the region of the  Fish River . A series of wars, called the  Cape Frontier Wars , ensued, mainly caused by conflicting land and livestock interests.   Great Britain  took over the  Cape of Good Hope  area in 1795 ostensibly to stop it falling into the hands of the Revolutionary French, but also seeking to use  Cape Town  in particular as a stop on the route to Australia and India. It was later returned to the Dutch in 1803, but soon afterwards the  Dutch East India Company  declared bankruptcy, and the British annexed the Cape Colony in 1806. The British continued the frontier wars against the Xhosa, pushing the eastern frontier eastward through a line of forts established along the Fish River and consolidating it by encouraging  British settlement . Due to pressure of  abolitionist  societies in Britain, the  British parliament  first stopped its global  slave trade  with the passage of the  Slave Trade Act 1807 , then abolished slavery in all its colonies with the  Slavery Abolition Act 1833 . During the 1830s, approximately 12 000  Boers  (later known as  Voortrekkers ), departed from the  Cape Colony , where they were subjected to British control, to the future Natal, Orange Free State and Transvaal regions. The Boers founded the  Boer Republics  - the  South African Republic  (Now  Gauteng ,  Limpopo ,  Mpumalanga  and  North West  provinces) and the  Orange Free State  ( Free State ).   The discovery of  diamonds  in 1867 and  gold  in 1884 in the interior encouraged economic growth and immigration, intensifying the subjugation of the indigenous people. These important economic resources did not only play a role between European and the indigenous population but also between the Boers and the British. [ 14 ]   The  Boer Republics  successfully resisted British encroachments during the  First Boer War  (18801881) using  guerrilla warfare  tactics, much better suited to local conditions. However, the British returned in greater numbers, more experience, and more suitable tactics in the  Second Boer War  (18991902). The Boers' attempt to ally themselves with  German South-West Africa  provided the British with yet another excuse to take control of the Boer Republics. [ citation needed ]           Boers  in combat (1881).         Independence   After four years of negotiating, the  Union of South Africa  was created from the  Cape  and  Natal  colonies, as well as the republics of  Orange Free State  and  Transvaal , on 31 May 1910, exactly eight years after the end of the Second Boer War. The newly created Union of South Africa was a  dominion . The  Natives' Land Act  of 1913 severely restricted the ownership of land by 'blacks', at that stage to a mere 7% of the country, although this amount was eventually increased marginally. [ 15 ]  The union was effectively granted independence from the United Kingdom with the passage of the  Statute of Westminster , which morphed the  British king's  position within South Africa into that of the distinct  King of South Africa . In 1934, the  South African Party  and  National Party  merged to form the  United Party , seeking reconciliation between Afrikaners and English-speaking ""Whites"", but split in 1939 over the entry of the Union into  World War II  as an ally of the United Kingdom, a move which the National Party strongly opposed.   In 1948, the  National Party  was elected to power, and intensified the implementation of racial segregation that had begun under Dutch and British colonial rule, and subsequent South African governments since the Union was formed. The Nationalist Government systematised existing segregationist laws, and the system of segregation became known collectively as  apartheid . Not surprisingly, this segregation also applied to the wealth acquired during rapid industrialisation of the 1950s, '60s, and '70s. While the White minority enjoyed the highest  standard of living  in all of Africa, often comparable to  First World  western nations, the Black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard, including income, education, housing, and life expectancy. On 31 May 1961, following a whites-only  referendum , the country became a  republic  and left the (British)  Commonwealth . The office of  Governor-General  was abolished and replaced with the position of  State President .   Apartheid became increasingly controversial, leading to widespread  sanctions ,  divestment  and growing unrest and oppression within South Africa. (See also the article on the  History of South Africa in the apartheid era .) A long period of harsh suppression by the government, and at times violent resistance,  strikes , marches, protests, and  sabotage  by bombing and other means, by various anti-apartheid movements, most notably the  African National Congress  (ANC), followed. In the late 1970s, South Africa began a programme of  nuclear weapons  development and in the following decade it produced six deliverable nuclear weapons. The rationale for the nuclear arsenal is disputed, but it is believed [ who? ]  that  Vorster  and  P.W. Botha  wanted to be able to catalyse American intervention in the event of a war between South Africa and the  Cuban -supported  MPLA  government of  Angola .     Democracy   In 1990 the  National Party  government took the first step towards negotiating itself out of power when it lifted the ban on the  African National Congress  and other  left-wing  political organisations, and released  Nelson Mandela  from prison after twenty-seven years' incarceration on a  sabotage  sentence. Apartheid legislation was gradually removed from the statute books, and South Africa also destroyed its nuclear arsenal and acceded to the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . The first  multi-racial elections  were held in 1994, which the ANC won by an overwhelming majority. It has been in power ever since.   In  post-apartheid South Africa , millions of South Africans, mostly black, continued to live in  poverty , though poverty among whites, previously rare, has increased greatly. [ 16 ]  While some have partly attributed this to the legacy of the apartheid system, increasingly many attribute it to the failure of the current government to tackle social issues, coupled with the monetary and fiscal discipline of the current government to ensure both redistribution of wealth and economic growth. Since the ANC-led government took power, the  United Nations   Human Development Index  of South Africa has fallen, while it was steadily rising until the mid-1990s. [ 17 ]  Some of this could possibly be attributed to the  AIDS   pandemic  and the failure of the government to take steps to address it, [ 18 ] some of it can also be pinpointed to a government policy of  redistribution of wealth . As a mitigating factor, the social housing policy of the current government has produced an improvement in living conditions.     Politics   Main articles:  Politics of South Africa ,  Government of South Africa , and  Law of South Africa          The  Union Buildings  in  Pretoria  is the home of the South African executive.       South Africa has three capital cities:  Cape Town , the largest of the three, is the  legislative  capital;  Pretoria  is the  administrative  capital; and  Bloemfontein  is the  judicial  capital. South Africa has a  bicameral   parliament : the  National Council of Provinces  (the  upper house ) has 90 members, while the  National Assembly  (the  lower house ) has 400 members. Members of the lower house are elected on a population basis by  proportional representation : half of the members are elected from national lists and the other half are elected from provincial lists. Ten members are elected to represent each province in the National Council of Provinces, regardless of the population of the province. Elections for both chambers are held every five years. The government is formed in the lower house, and the leader of the majority party in the National Assembly is the  President .   The primary sources of South Africa law are Roman-Dutch mercantile law and personal law with English Common law, as imports of Dutch settlements and  British colonialism . [ 19 ]  The first European based law in South Africa was brought by the  Dutch East India Company  and is called  Roman-Dutch law . It was imported before the  codification  of European law into the  Napoleonic Code  and is comparable in many ways to  Scots law . This was followed in the 19th century by  English law , both  common  and  statutory . Starting in 1910 with unification, South Africa had its own  parliament  which passed laws specific for South Africa, building on those previously passed for the individual member colonies.   Current South African politics are dominated by the  African National Congress  (ANC), which received 69.7% of the vote during the last  2004 general election  and 66.3% of the vote in the  2006 municipal election . The current  President of South Africa  is  Kgalema Motlanthe , who replaced  Thabo Mbeki  on 25 September 2008. Mbeki succeeded former President  Nelson Mandela  in 1999, and was re-elected for a second five year term in 2004, but announced his resignation on 20 September 2008.   The main challenger to the rule of the ANC is the  Democratic Alliance  party, which received 12.4% of the vote in the 2004 election and 14.8% in the 2006 election.  Helen Zille , (elected 6 May 2007), is the party leader; the previous leader was  Tony Leon . The formerly dominant  New National Party , which introduced apartheid through its predecessor, the  National Party , chose to merge with the ANC on 9 April 2005. Other major political parties represented in Parliament are the  Inkatha Freedom Party , which mainly represents  Zulu  voters, and the  Independent Democrats , who took 6.97% and 1.7% of the vote respectively, in the 2004 election.   Since 2004, the country has had many thousands of popular protests, some violent, making it, according to one academic, the ""most protest-rich country in the world"". [ 20 ]  Many of these protests have been organised from the growing  shanty towns  that surround South African cities.     Foreign relations and military   Main articles:  South African National Defence Force ,  Foreign relations of South Africa , and  South Africa and weapons of mass destruction   Since the end of apartheid, the South African foreign policy has focused on its African partners particularly in the  Southern African Development Community  (SADC) and the  African Union . South Africa has played a key role as a mediator in African conflicts over the last decade, such as in  Burundi , the  Democratic Republic of Congo , the  Comoros , and  Zimbabwe . After apartheid ended, South Africa was readmitted to the  Commonwealth of Nations . As the  Union of South Africa , South Africa was a founding member of the  United Nations  and the then Prime Minister  Jan Smuts  wrote the preamble to its constitution. South Africa is currently a non-permanent member of the  United Nations Security Council  and has attracted controversy by voting against a resolution criticising the  Burmese  government in 2006 and against the implementation of sanctions against  Zimbabwe  in 2008. South Africa is a member of the  Group of 77  and chaired the organisation in 2006. South Africa is a member of the  South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone ,  Southern African Customs Union ,  World Trade Organization ,  International Monetary Fund ,  G20  and  G8+5 .   The South African  armed forces , known as the  South African National Defence Force  (SANDF), was created in 1994. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  Previously known as the  South African Defence Force  (SADF), the new force is an all volunteer army and consists of the forces of the old SADF, as well as the forces of the African nationalist groups, namely  Umkhonto we Sizwe  (MK),  Azanian People's Liberation Army  (APLA), and the former  Bantustan  defence forces. [ 21 ]  The SANDF is subdivided into four branches, the  South African Army , the  South African Air Force , the  South African Navy , and the  South African Military Health Services . [ 23 ]   In recent years, the SANDF has become a major  peacekeeping  force in Africa, [ 24 ]  and has been involved in operations in  Lesotho , the  Democratic Republic of the Congo , [ 24 ]  and  Burundi , [ 24 ]  amongst others. It has also participated as a part of multi-national  UN  peacekeeping forces.   South Africa undertook a nuclear weapons programme in the 1970s [ 25 ]  and  may have conducted  a nuclear test over the  Atlantic  in 1979. [ 26 ]  It is the only African country to have successfully  developed nuclear weapons . It has become the first country (followed by Ukraine) with nuclear capability to voluntarily renounce and dismantle its programme and in the process signed the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty  in 1991. [ 25 ]     Provinces, districts and municipalities   Main articles:  Provinces of South Africa ,  Districts of South Africa , and  Municipalities of South Africa          Map showing the provinces and districts (numbered) of South Africa.             Northern Cape          North West          Gauteng          Limpopo          Mpumalanga            KwaZulu-Natal          Eastern Cape          Free State          Western Cape               When apartheid ended in 1994, the South African government had to integrate the formerly independent and semi-independent  Bantustans  into the political structure of South Africa. To this end, it abolished the four former provinces of South Africa ( Cape Province ,  Natal ,  Orange Free State , and  Transvaal ) and replaced them with nine fully integrated provinces. The new provinces are usually much smaller than the former provinces, which theoretically gives local governments more resources to distribute over smaller areas.   The nine provinces are further subdivided into  52 districts :  6 metropolitan  and  46 district municipalities . The 46 district municipalities are further subdivided into  231 local municipalities . The district municipalities also contain 20 district management areas (mostly game parks) that are directly governed by the district municipalities. The six metropolitan municipalities perform the functions of both district and local municipalities.

At 470,979  sq mi  (1,219,912 km), [ 27 ]  South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world (after  Mali ). It is comparable in size to  Colombia .  Njesuthi  in the  Drakensberg  at 3,408 m (11,424 ft) is the highest peak in South Africa.          View of the  Drakensberg mountains , the highest mountain range in South Africa.       South Africa has a generally  temperate climate , due in part to it being surrounded by the  Atlantic  and  Indian Oceans  on three sides, by its location in the climatically milder  southern hemisphere  and due to the average elevation rising steadily towards the north (towards the  equator ) and further inland. Due to this varied topography and oceanic influence, a great variety of climatic zones exist.   The climatic zones vary, from the extreme  desert  of the southern  Namib  in the farthest northwest to the lush  subtropical  climate in the east along the  Mozambique  border and the  Indian  ocean. From the east, the land quickly rises over a  mountainous   escarpment  towards the interior  plateau  known as the  Highveld . Even though South Africa is classified as  semi-arid , there is considerable variation in  climate  as well as  topography .   The interior of South Africa is a vast, rather flat, and sparsely populated  scrubland ,  Karoo , which is drier towards the northwest along the Namib desert. In contrast, the eastern coastline is lush and well-watered, which produces a climate similar to the tropics. The extreme southwest has a climate remarkably similar to that of the  Mediterranean  with wet winters and hot, dry summers, hosting the famous  Fynbos   Biome . This area also produces much of the  wine  in South Africa. This region is also particularly known for its wind, which blows intermittently almost all year. The severity of this wind made passing around the  Cape of Good Hope  particularly treacherous for sailors, causing many  shipwrecks . Further east on the south coast, rainfall is distributed more evenly throughout the year, producing a green landscape. This area is popularly known as the  Garden Route .          Satellite picture of South Africa       The  Free State  is particularly flat due to the fact that it lies centrally on the high plateau. North of the  Vaal River , the Highveld becomes better watered and does not experience subtropical extremes of heat.  Johannesburg , in the centre of the Highveld, is at 1,740 metres (5,709 ft) and receives an annual rainfall of 760 millimetres (30  in ). Winters in this region are cold, although  snow  is rare.   To the north of Johannesburg, the altitude drops beyond the escarpment of the Highveld, and turns into the lower lying Bushveld, an area of mixed dry forest and an abundance of wildlife. East of the Highveld, beyond the eastern escarpment, the Lowveld stretches towards the  Indian  ocean. It has particularly high temperatures, and is also the location of extended subtropical agriculture.   The high  Drakensberg mountains , which form the south-eastern escarpment of the Highveld, offer limited  skiing  opportunities in winter. The coldest place in South Africa is  Sutherland  in the western  Roggeveld Mountains , where midwinter temperatures can reach as low as 15 degrees  Celsius  (5  F ). The deep interior has the hottest temperatures: A temperature of 51.7 C (125 F) was recorded in 1948 in the  Northern Cape  Kalahari near  Upington . [ 28 ]   South Africa also has one possession, the small sub-Antarctic archipelago of the  Prince Edward Islands , consisting of  Marion Island  (290 km/112 sq mi) and Prince Edward Island (45 km/17.3 sq mi) (not to be confused with the  Canadian province of the same name ).           Weather averages for Cape Town, South Africa         Month   Jan   Feb   Mar   Apr   May   Jun   Jul   Aug   Sep   Oct   Nov   Dec   Year       Average high C (F)   27  (81)   28  (82)   26  (79)   24  (75)   20  (68)   18  (64)   17  (63)   18  (64)   19  (66)   22  (72)   24  (75)   26  (79)   28  (82)       Average low C (F)   16  (61)   16  (61)   15  (59)   13  (55)   10  (50)   8  (46)   8  (46)   8  (46)   9  (48)   11  (52)   14  (57)   15  (59)   8  (46)       Precipitation  mm (inches)   16.5  (0.65)   13  (0.51)   20  (0.79)   54  (2.13)   92  (3.62)   111  (4.37)   96  (3.78)   87  (3.43)   56  (2.2)   40  (1.57)   24  (0.94)   18  (0.71)   627  (24.69)       Source: EuroWEATHER [ 29 ]  2008-02-22         Flora and fauna   See also:  Wildlife of South Africa   See also:  Protected areas of South Africa           Fynbos , a  floral kingdom  unique to South Africa, is found near  Cape Town               Swartberg  mountains near the town of  Oudtshoorn              A field of flowers in Weskus National Park.       South Africa is one of only 17 countries worldwide considered  megadiverse . It has more than 20,000 different  plants , or about 10% of all the known  species  of plants on  Earth , making it particularly rich in plant biodiversity. South Africa is the 6th most biodiverse country, [ 30 ]  after  Brazil ,  Colombia ,  Indonesia ,  China , and  Mexico . The most prevalent biome in South Africa is the  grassland , particularly on the  Highveld , where the plant cover is dominated by different  grasses , low  shrubs , and  acacia trees , mainly camel-thorn and whitethorn.  Vegetation  becomes even more sparse towards the northwest due to low  rainfall . There are several species of water-storing  succulents  like  aloes  and euphorbias in the very hot and dry  Namaqualand  area. The grass and thorn  savannah  turns slowly into a bush savannah towards the north-east of the country, with denser growth. There are significant numbers of  baobab  trees in this area, near the northern end of  Kruger National Park . [ 31 ]   The  Fynbos   Biome , which makes up the majority of the area and plant life in the  Cape floristic region , one of the six  floral kingdoms , is located in a small region of the  Western Cape  and contains more than 9,000 of those species, making it among the richest regions on earth in terms of floral biodiversity. The majority of the plants are  evergreen  hard-leaf plants with fine, needle-like  leaves , such as the  sclerophyllous  plants. Another uniquely South African plant is the  protea  genus of flowering plants. There are around 130 different species of protea in South Africa.   While South Africa has a great wealth of flowering plants, it has few  forests . Only 1% of South Africa is forest, almost exclusively in the  humid   coastal plain  along the  Indian Ocean  in  KwaZulu-Natal  (see  KwaZulu-Cape coastal forest mosaic ). There are even smaller reserves of forests that are out of the reach of  fire , known as montane forests (see  Knysna-Amatole montane forests ).  Plantations  of imported tree species are predominant, particularly the non-native  eucalyptus  and  pine . South Africa has lost a large area of natural habitat in the last four decades, primarily due to  overpopulation , sprawling development patterns and  deforestation  during the nineteenth century. South Africa is one of the worst affected countries in the world when it comes to invasion by alien species with many (e.g.  Black Wattle ,  Port Jackson ,  Hakea ,  Lantana  and  Jacaranda ) posing a significant threat to the native  biodiversity  and the already scarce water resources. The original  temperate forest  that met the first European settlers to South Africa was exploited ruthlessly until only small patches remained. Currently, South African  hardwood  trees like  Real Yellowwood   (Podocarpus latifolius) ,  stinkwood   (Ocotea bullata) , and South African  Black Ironwood   (Olea laurifolia)  are under government protection.   Numerous  mammals  are found in the  bushveld  habitats including  lions ,  leopards ,  white rhinos ,  blue wildebeest ,  kudus ,  impalas ,  hyenas ,  hippopotamus  and  giraffes . A significant extent of the bushveld habitat exists in the north-east including  Kruger National Park  and the  Mala Mala  Reserve, as well as in the far north in the  Waterberg Biosphere .   Climate change is expected to bring considerable warming and drying to much of this already semi-arid region, with greater frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, flooding and drought. According to computer generated climate modelling produced by the South African National Biodiversity Institute [ 32 ]  parts of southern Africa will see an increase in temperature by about one degree Celsius along the coast to more than four degrees Celsius in the already hot hinterland such as the  Northern Cape  in late spring and summertime by 2050.   The Cape Floral Kingdom has been identified as one of the global  biodiversity hotspots  since it will be hit very hard by  climate change  and has such a great diversity of life. Drought, increased intensity and frequency of fire and climbing temperatures are expected to push many of these  rare species  towards  extinction .   South Africa houses many endemic species, among them the  critically endangered   Riverine Rabbit  ( Bunolagus monticullaris ) in the  Karoo .

Cape Town has become an important  retail  and  tourism  centre for the country, and attracts the largest number of foreign visitors in South Africa       By  UN  classification South Africa is a middle-income country with an abundant supply of resources, well-developed financial, legal, communications, energy, and transport sectors, a  stock exchange  (the  JSE Limited ), that ranks among the top twenty in the world, and a modern infrastructure supporting an efficient distribution of goods to major urban centres throughout the entire region. South Africa is ranked 25th in the world in terms of  GDP  (PPP) as of 2007.   Advanced development is significantly localised around four areas: Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Durban, and Pretoria/Johannesburg. Beyond these four economic centres, development is marginal and poverty is still prevalent despite government efforts. Consequently the vast majority of South Africans are poor. However, key marginal areas have experienced rapid growth recently. Such areas include Mossel Bay to Plettenberg Bay; Rustenburg area; Nelspruit area; Bloemfontein; Cape West Coast; and the KwaZulu-Natal North Coast.   Even though South Africa has the seventh highest per capita income in Africa, only behind  Libya ,  Mauritius  it suffers from large income gaps and a  dual economy  marking it as a  developing country . South Africa has one of the highest rates of  income inequality  in the world. A decade of continual economic growth has helped to lower unemployment, but daunting economic and social problems remain. The average South African household income decreased considerably between 1995 and 2000. As for racial inequality,  Statistics South Africa  reported that in 1995 the average white household earned four times as much as the average black household. In 2000 the average white household was earning six times more than the average black household. [ 33 ]  The  affirmative action  policies have seen a rise in black economic wealth and an emerging black middle class. [ 34 ]  Other problems are crime, corruption, and  HIV / AIDS .   At the start of 2000, then President Thabo Mbeki vowed to promote economic growth and foreign investment by relaxing restrictive labour laws, stepping up the pace of  privatisation , and cutting unneeded governmental spending. His policies face strong opposition from organised  labour . South Africa is also the largest energy producer and consumer on the continent. South Africa is a popular tourist destination, and a substantial amount of revenue comes from tourism. [ 35 ]  Among the main attractions are the diverse and picturesque culture, the game reserves and the highly regarded local wines.   The South African  rand  (ZAR), is the most actively traded emerging  market currency  in the world. It has joined an elite club of fifteen currencies, the  Continuous linked settlement  (CLS), where forex transactions are settled immediately, lowering the risks of transacting across  time zones . The rand was the best-performing currency against the  United States dollar  (USD) between 2002 and 2005, according to the  Bloomberg  Currency Scorecard.   The volatility of the  rand  has affected economic activity, falling sharply during 2001 and hitting a historic low of 13.85  ZAR  to the  USD , raising fears of inflation, and causing the Reserve Bank to increase  interest rates . The rand has since recovered, trading at 7.13 ZAR to the dollar as of January 2008. However, as exporters are put under considerable pressure from a stronger domestic currency, many call for government intervention to help soften the rand.   Refugees from poorer neighbouring countries include many immigrants from the DRC, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Malawi and others, representing a large portion of the informal sector. With high unemployment levels amongst poorer South Africans,  xenophobia  is prevalent and many people born in South Africa feel resentful of immigrants who are seen to be depriving the native population of jobs, a feeling which has been given credibility by the fact that many South African employers have employed migrants from other countries for lower pay than South African citizens, especially in the  construction ,  tourism ,  agriculture  and  domestic service  industries. Illegal immigrants are also heavily involved in informal trading. [ 36 ]  However, many immigrants to South Africa continue to live in poor conditions, and the South African immigration policy has become increasingly restrictive since 1994. [ 37 ]   Principal international trading partners of South Africa  besides other African countries  include  Germany , the  United States ,  China ,  Japan , the  United Kingdom  and  Spain .  [ 38 ]  Chief exports include  corn ,  diamonds ,  fruits ,  gold ,  metals  and  minerals ,  sugar , and  wool .  Machinery  and transportation equipment make up more than one-third of the value of the countrys imports. Other imports include  chemicals , manufactured goods, and  petroleum .     Electricity crisis   After unsuccessful attempts by the government to encourage private construction of electricity generation capacity, in 2007 the state-owned electricity supplier ( Eskom ) started experiencing a lack of capacity in the electrical generating and reticulation infrastructure. This led to an inability to meet the routine demands of industry and consumers, resulting in countrywide  rolling blackouts . Initially the lack of capacity was triggered by a failure at  Koeberg nuclear power station , but since then a general lack of capacity became evident. The supplier has been widely criticised for failing to adequately plan for and construct sufficient electrical generating capacity, [ 39 ]  although ultimately the government has admitted that it is at fault for refusing to approve funding for investment in infrastructure. [ 40 ]     Agriculture          Workers planting on a farm in the central area of  Mpumalanga .               Farm  workers.       South Africa has a large agricultural sector and is a net exporter of  farming  products. There are almost a thousand  agricultural cooperatives  and  agribusinesses  throughout the country, and agricultural exports have constituted 8% of South African total exports for the past five years. The agricultural industry contributes around 10% of formal employment, relatively low compared to other parts of Africa, as well as providing work for casual labourers and contributing around 2.6% of  GDP  for the nation. [ 41 ]  However, due to the  aridity  of the land, only 13.5% can be used for crop production, and only 3% is considered high potential land. [ 42 ]   Although the commercial farming sector is relatively well developed, people in some rural areas still survive on  subsistence agriculture . It is the eighth largest wine producer in the world, and the eleventh largest producer of sunflower seed. South Africa is a net exporter of agricultural products and foodstuffs, the largest number of exported items being  sugar ,  grapes ,  citrus ,  nectarines ,  wine  and  deciduous  fruit. The largest locally produced crop is  maize  (corn), and it has been estimated that 9 million tons are produced every year, with 7.4 million tons being consumed.  Livestock  are also popular on South African farms, with the country producing 85% of all meat consumed. The dairy industry consists of around 4,300 milk producers providing employment for 60,000 farm workers and contributing to the livelihoods of around 40,000 others. [ 43 ]   In recent years, the agricultural sector has introduced several reforms, some of which are controversial, such as  land reform  and the deregulation of the market for agricultural products. Land reform has been criticised both by farmers' groups and by landless workers, the latter alleging that the pace of change has not been fast enough, and the former alleging racist treatment and expressing concerns that a similar situation to  Zimbabwe's land reform policy  may develop, [ 44 ]  a fear exacerbated by comments made by  deputy president , the deputy president of South Africa. [ 45 ] [ 46 ]  The sector continues to face problems, with increased foreign competition and crime being two of the major challenges for the industry. The government has been accused of either putting in too much effort [ 47 ] , or not enough effort [ 48 ] , to tackle the problem of  farm attacks  as opposed to other forms of violent crime.   Another issue which affects South African agriculture is environmental damage caused by misuse of the land and global climate change. South Africa is unusually vulnerable to climate change and resultant diminution of surface waters. Some predictions show surface water supply could decrease by 60% by the year 2070 in parts of the Western Cape. [ 49 ]  To reverse the damage caused by land mismanagement, the government has supported a scheme which promotes  sustainable development  and the use of natural resources. [ 50 ]  Maize production, which contributes to a 36% majority of the gross value of South Africas field crops, has also experienced negative effects due to climate change. The estimated value of loss, which takes into consideration scenarios with and without the carbon dioxide fertilisation effect  [2]  ,ranges between 10s to 100s of millions of Rands.

South Africa is a nation of more than 48 million people of diverse origins,  cultures ,  languages , and  religions . The last  census  was held in 2001 and the next will be in 2011.  Statistics South Africa  provided five  racial  categories by which people could classify themselves, the last of which, ""unspecified/other"" drew negligible responses, and these results were omitted. [ 52 ]  The 2006 midyear estimated figures for the other categories were  Black African  at 79.5%,  White  at 9.2%,  Coloured  at 8.9%, and  Indian or Asian  at 2.5%. [ 53 ]  Even though the population of South Africa has increased in the past decade [ 52 ] [ 54 ]  (primarily due to immigration), the country had an annual population growth rate of 0.501% in 2008 (CIA est.), including immigration. [ 55 ]  South Africa is home to an estimated 5 million  illegal immigrants , including some 3 million  Zimbabweans . [ 56 ] [ 57 ] [ 58 ]  A series of  anti-immigrant riots  occurred in South Africa beginning on 11 May 2008. [ 59 ] [ 60 ]   By far the major part of the population classified itself as African or black, but it is not culturally or linguistically homogeneous. Major ethnic groups include the  Zulu ,  Xhosa ,  Basotho  (South Sotho),  Bapedi  (North Sotho),  Venda ,  Tswana ,  Tsonga ,  Swazi  and  Ndebele , all of which speak  Bantu languages  (see  Bantu peoples of South Africa ).   Some, such as the Zulu, Xhosa, Bapedi and Venda groups, are unique to South Africa. Other groups are distributed across the borders with neighbours of South Africa: The  Basotho  group is also the major ethnic group in  Lesotho . The  Tswana  ethnic group constitute the majority of the population of  Botswana . The  Swazi  ethnic group is the major ethnic group in  Swaziland . The  Ndebele  ethnic group is also found in  Matabeleland  in  Zimbabwe , where they are known as the  Matabele . These Ndebele people are the descendants of a Zulu faction under the warrior  Mzilikazi  that escaped persecution from  Shaka  by migrating to their current territory. The  Tsonga  ethnic group is also found in southern  Mozambique , where they are known as the Shangaan.   The white population is not ethnically homogeneous and descend from many ethnic groups:  Dutch ,  Flemish ,  Portuguese , German, French  Huguenot , English, Irish, Italian, Scottish and  Welsh . Culturally and linguistically, they are divided into the  Afrikaners , who speak  Afrikaans , and English-speaking groups, many of whom are descended from British and Irish immigrants (see  Anglo-African ). Many small communities that have immigrated over the last century retain the use of other languages. The  white population  is on the decrease due to a low birth rate and emigration; as a factor in their decision to emigrate, many cite the high  crime  rate and the  affirmative action  policies of the government. Since 1994, approximately 1 000 000 white South Africans have permanently emigrated. [ 61 ] [ 62 ] [ 63 ] [ 64 ]  Despite high emigration levels, a high level of non-South African white immigrants have settled in the country, in particular from countries such as  Britain  and  Zimbabwe . For example, by 2005, an estimated 212 000 British citizens were residing in South Africa. Since 2003, the numbers of British migrants coming to South Africa has risen by 50%. An estimated 20 000 British migrants moved to South Africa in 2007. There have also been a significant number of  white Zimbabwean  arrivals, fleeing their home country in light of the economic and political problems currently facing the country. As well as recent arrivals, a significant number of white Zimbabweans emigrated to South Africa in the wake of independence in Zimbabwe in 1980. Some of the more nostalgic members of the community are known in popular culture as "" Whenwes "", because of their nostalgia for their lives in  Rhodesia  ""when we were in Rhodesia"". [ 65 ]   The term  Coloured  is still largely used for the people of mixed race descended from slaves brought in from East and Central Africa, the indigenous  Khoisan  who lived in the  Cape  at the time, Bantus, Whites (mostly the  Dutch / Afrikaner  and British settlers) as well as an admixture of  Javanese ,  Malay , Indian,  Malagasy  and Asian blood (such as  Burmese ). The majority speak Afrikaans. Khoisan is a term used to describe two separate groups, physically similar: light-skinned and small in stature. The  Khoikhoi , who were called  Hottentots  by the Europeans, were pastoralists and were annihilated; the San, called  Bushmen  by the Europeans, were hunter-gatherers. Within the Coloured community, more recent immigrants will also be found: Coloureds from the former  Rhodesia  (now  Zimbabwe );  Namibia  and immigrants of mixed descent from India and  Burma  ( Anglo-Indians / Anglo-Burmese ) who were welcomed to the Cape when India and Burma received their Independence.   The major part of the South African  Asian  population is Indian in origin (see  Indian South Africans ); many of them descended from indentured workers brought in the nineteenth century to work on the  sugar   plantations  of the eastern coastal area then known as  Natal . There is also a significant group of  Chinese South Africans  (approximately 100,000 individuals) and  Vietnamese  South Africans (approximately 50,000 individuals). In 2008, the Pretoria High Court has ruled that Chinese South Africans who arrived before 1994 are to be reclassified as  Coloureds . As a result of this ruling, about 12,000 - 15,000  [ 66 ] ethnically Chinese citizens who arrived before 1994, numbering 3%-5% of the total Chinese population in the country, will be able to benefit from government  BEE  policies. [ 67 ]   South Africa hosts a sizeable refugee and asylum seeker population. According to the  World Refugee Survey 2008 , published by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, this population numbered approximately 144,700 in 2007. [ 68 ]  Groups of refugees and asylum seekers numbering over 10,000 included people from  Zimbabwe  (48,400), The  Democratic Republic of the Congo  (24,800), and  Somalia  (12,900). [ 68 ]  These populations mainly lived in Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban, Cape Town, and Port Elizabeth. [ 68 ]     Science and technology   Several important scientific and technological developments have originated in South Africa.  The first human to human heart transplant was performed by cardiac surgeon  Christiaan Barnard  at  Groote Schuur Hospital  in December 1967  .  Max Theiler  developed a vaccine against Yellow Fever,  Allan McLeod Cormack  pioneered x-ray  Computed tomography , and  Aaron Klug  developed crystallographic electron microscopy techniques. These advancements were all recognised with  Nobel Prizes .  Sydney Brenner  won most recently, in 2002, for his pioneering work in  molecular biology .   Mark Shuttleworth  founded an early Internet security company  Thawte , that was subsequently bought out by world-leader  VeriSign . Despite government efforts to encourage entrepreneurship in biotechnology, IT and other high technology fields, no other notable groundbreaking companies have been founded in South Africa. However, it is the expressed objective of the government to transition the economy to be more reliant on high technology, based on the realisation that South African cannot compete with Far Eastern economies in manufacturing, nor can the republic rely on its mineral wealth in perpetuity.   South Africa has cultivated a burgeoning astronomy community. It hosts the  Southern African Large Telescope , the largest optical telescope in the southern hemisphere. South Africa is currently building the  Karoo Array Telescope  as a pathfinder for the $20 billion  Square Kilometer Array  project. South Africa is a finalist, with Australia, to be the host of the SKA.     Society and culture   Main article:  Culture of South Africa          Decorated houses,  Drakensberg Mountains              Traditional  South African cuisine .       It may be argued that there is no ""single"" culture in South Africa because of its ethnic diversity. Today, the diversity in foods from many cultures is enjoyed by all and especially marketed to tourists who wish to sample the large variety of South African cuisine. In addition to  food ,  music  and  dance  feature prominently.   South African cuisine  is heavily  meat-based  and has spawned the distinctively South African social gathering known as a  braai , or barbecue. South Africa has also developed into a major  wine  producer, with some of the best  vineyards  lying in valleys around  Stellenbosch ,  Franschoek ,  Paarl  and  Barrydale . [ 69 ]   There is great diversity in music from South Africa. Many black musicians who sang in Afrikaans or English during apartheid have since begun to sing in traditional African languages, and have developed a unique style called  Kwaito . Of note is  Brenda Fassie , who launched to fame with her song ""Weekend Special"", which was sung in English. More famous traditional musicians include  Ladysmith Black Mambazo , while the  Soweto String Quartet  performs classic music with an African flavour. White and Coloured South African singers are historically influenced by European musical styles including such western metal bands such as  Seether  (formerly Saron Gas). South Africa has produced world-famous jazz musicians, notably  Hugh Masekela ,  Jonas Gwangwa ,  Abdullah Ibrahim ,  Miriam Makeba ,  Jonathan Butler ,  Chris McGregor , and  Sathima Bea Benjamin .  Afrikaans  music covers multiple genres, such as the  contemporary   Steve Hofmeyr  and the  punk rock  band  Fokofpolisiekar . Crossover artists such as  Johnny Clegg  and his bands  Juluka  and  Savuka  have enjoyed various success underground, publicly, and abroad.   The South African black majority still has a substantial number of rural inhabitants who lead largely impoverished lives. It is among these people, however, that cultural traditions survive most strongly; as blacks have become increasingly  urbanised  and  westernised , aspects of traditional culture have declined. Urban blacks usually speak English or  Afrikaans  in addition to their native tongue. There are smaller but still significant groups of speakers of  Khoisan languages  who are not included in the eleven official languages, but are one of the eight other officially recognised languages. There are small groups of speakers of  endangered languages , most of which are from the Khoi-San family, that receive no official status; however, some groups within South Africa are attempting to promote their use and revival.   The  middle class  lifestyle, predominantly of the white minority but with growing numbers of Black, Coloured and Indian people, [ 70 ]  is similar in many respects to that of people found in  Western Europe , North America and  Australasia . Members of the middle class often study and work abroad for greater exposure to the markets of the world.   Asians , predominantly of Indian origin, preserve their own cultural heritage, languages and religious beliefs, being either  Christian ,  Hindu  or  Sunni Muslim  and speaking English, with Indian languages like  Hindi ,  Telugu ,  Tamil  or  Gujarati  being spoken less frequently, but the majority of Indians being able to understand their mother tongue. The first Indians arrived on the famous  Truro ship  as  indentured labourers  in Natal to work the Sugar Cane Fields. There is a much smaller  Chinese  community in South Africa, although its numbers have increased due to immigration from  Republic of China  (Taiwan).   South Africa has also had a large influence in the  Scouting  movement, with many Scouting traditions and ceremonies coming from the experiences of  Robert Baden-Powell  (the founder of Scouting) during his time in South Africa as a military officer in the 1890s. The  South African Scout Association  was one of the first youth organisations to open its doors to youth and adults of all races in South Africa. This happened on 2 July 1977 at a conference known as  Quo Vadis . [ 71 ]   The South African music scene consists of  Kwaito , a new music genre that had developed in the mid 80s and has since developed to become the most popular social economical form of representation among the populous. Though some may argue that the political aspects of Kwaito has since diminished after  Apartheid , and the relative interest in politics has become a minor aspect of daily life. Some argue that in a sense,  Kwaito  is in fact a political force that shows activism in its apolitical actions. Today, major corporations like  Sony ,  BMG , and  EMI  have appeared on the South African scene to produce and distribute  Kwaito  music. Due to its overwhelming popularity, as well as the general influence of DJs, who are among the top 5 most influential types of people within the country,  Kwaito  has taken over radio, television, and magazines. [ 72 ]   Kwaito , much like most hip-hop has its own local flavor and originality. However, unlike when hip-hop first burst on the scene as a politically driven and rebellious underground movement, South Africans wanted to create a happier vibe. As the post-apartheid fog cleared, South African youth found their ""own voice in a style of music known as kwaito, spawning a new (and profitable) industry"". [ 73 ]  According to TIMEeurope magazine, ""The kwaito sound now regularly incorporates traditional African music, jazz, gospel, and even rock guitar, most notably on Mandoza's 2000 hit Nkalakatha, one of the few kwaito records to cross over onto traditionally white radio"". [ 74 ]  In the kwaito, the samples from old school  Jamaican dancehall , European house, etc.,  tempos  are changed, beats are added, and urban street slang is also incorporated. This local flavour of music more recently has been attacked for its lack of ingenuity and its betrayal of its roots. The melodies and the incorporation of sex and dance have since become very similar to the American standard. In addition Kwaito has been criticised for its absence of influential lyrical content. As Kwaito is still a developing genre, and since the South African population is only around 48 million, sales of only 25,000 CDs are required for ""gold"" certification in South Africa. [ 73 ]     Religion   Main article:  Religion in South Africa           St. Mark 's Anglican Cathedral.       According to the latest 2001 national census, Christians accounted for 79.7% of the population. This includes  Zion Christian  11.1%,  Pentecostal  ( Charismatic ) 8.2%,  Roman Catholic  7.1%,  Methodist  6.8%,  Dutch Reformed  6.7%,  Anglican  3.8%, and other Christian 36%.  Islam  accounted for 1.5% of the population,  Hinduism  about 1.3%, and  Judaism  0.2%. 15.1% had no religious affiliation, 2.3% were other and 1.4% were unspecified. [ 75 ] [ 76 ]   African Indigenous Churches were the largest of the  Christian  groups. It was believed that many of these persons who claimed no affiliation with any organised religion adhered to  traditional indigenous religions . Many peoples have  syncretic  religious practices combining Christian and indigenous influences. [ 77 ]   Islam in South Africa  itself is not known to pre-date the colonial period, despite the isolated contact neighbouring  Mozambique  had with  Arab  and  East African  traders. [ citation needed ]  There is no evidence that Islam was known to the  Zulu ,  Swazi , or  Xhosa  of the east coast prior to the colonial era. Many South African Muslims are described as  Coloureds , notably in the  Western Cape , especially those whose ancestors came as slaves from the Indonesian archipelago (the  Cape Malays ). Others are described as  Indians , notably in  KwaZulu-Natal , including those whose ancestors came as traders from  South Asia ; they have been joined by others from other parts of Africa as well as white or black South African converts. It is estimated that  Islam  is the fastest growing religion of conversion in the country, [ 78 ]  with the number of black  Muslims  growing sixfold, from 12,000 in 1991 to 74,700 in 2004. [ 79 ]   Hinduism  dates back to British Colonial period primarily but later waves of continuous immigrants from India have contributed to a sizeable Hindu population. Most Hindus are ethnically South Asian but there are many who come from mixed racial stock and many are converts with the efforts of Hindu missionaries such as ISKCON. Other religions in smaller numbers are  Sikhism ,  Jainism  and  Bah' Faith . [ 76 ]     Languages   Main article:  Languages of South Africa          Map showing principal South African languages by municipality. Lighter shades indicate a non-majority  plurality .             Afrikaans          Northern Sotho          Southern Sotho          Swati          Tsonga            Tswana          Venda          Xhosa          Zulu               South Africa has eleven  official languages : [ 80 ]   Sepedi ,  Sesotho ,  Setswana ,  siSwati ,  Tshivenda ,  Xitsonga ,  Afrikaans ,  English ,  isiNdebele ,  isiXhosa  and  isiZulu . In this regard it is  second only to India  in number. While each language is formally equal to every other, some languages are spoken more than others. According to the 2001 National Census, the three most spoken first home languages are Zulu (23.8%), Xhosa (17.6%) and Afrikaans (13.3%). [ 52 ]  Despite the fact that English is recognised as the language of commerce and science, it was spoken by only 8.2% of South Africans at home in 2001, an even lower percentage than in 1996 (8.6%). [ 52 ]   There are  eleven official names  for South Africa, one in each of the official national languages. The country also recognises eight non-official languages:  Fanagalo ,  Khoe ,  Lobedu ,  Nama ,  Northern Ndebele ,  Phuthi ,  San  and  South African Sign Language . [ citation needed ]  These non-official languages may be used in certain official uses in limited areas where it has been determined that these languages are prevalent. Nevertheless, their populations are not such that they require nationwide recognition.   Many of the ""unofficial languages"" of the  San  and  Khoikhoi  people contain regional  dialects  stretching northward into Namibia and Botswana, and elsewhere. These people, who are a physically distinct population from other Africans, have their own cultural identity based on their  hunter-gatherer  societies. They have been marginalised to a great extent, and many of their languages are in danger of becoming  extinct .   Many white South Africans also speak other European languages, such as  Portuguese  (also spoken by Angolan and Mozambican blacks), German, and  Greek , while some  Asians  and  Indians  in South Africa speak  South Asian  languages, such as  Tamil ,  Hindi ,  Gujarati ,  Urdu  and  Telugu .  French  is still widely spoken by French South Africans especially in places like  Franschhoek , where many South Africans are of French origin. South African French is spoken by less than 10,000 individuals. Congolese French is also spoken in South Africa by migrants.

[ 81 ]  The link between HIV, a virus spread primarily by sexual contact, and AIDS was long denied by prior president  Thabo Mbeki  and then health minister  Manto Tshabalala-Msimang , who insisted that the many deaths in the country are due to malnutrition, and hence poverty, and not HIV. [ 82 ]  In 2007, in response to international pressure, the government made efforts to fight AIDS. [ 83 ]  In September 2008 Thabo Mbeki was ousted by the ANC and  Kgalema Motlanthe  was appointed for the interim. One of Mr. Motlanthe's first actions was to replace Mrs. Tshabalala-Msimang with the current minister,  Barbara Hogan .   AIDS affects mainly those who are sexually active and is far more prevalent in the black population. Most deaths are people who are also economically active, resulting in many families losing their primary wage earners. This has resulted in many 'AIDS orphans' who in many cases depend on the state for care and financial support. [ 84 ]  It is estimated that there are 1,200,000 orphans in South Africa. [ 84 ]  Many elderly people also lose the support from lost younger members of their family. Roughly 5 million people are infected with the disease. [ 83 ]     Crime   Main article:  Crime in South Africa           Prison  buildings on  Robben Island       According to a survey for the period 19982000 compiled by the  United Nations , South Africa was ranked second for  murder  and first for  assaults  and  rapes  per capita. [ 85 ]  Total crime per capita is 10th out of the 60 countries in the data set.   Crime  has had a pronounced effect on society: many middle-class South Africans moved into  gated communities , abandoning the central business districts of some cities for the relative security of suburbs. This effect is most pronounced in  Johannesburg , although the trend is noticeable in other cities as well. [ citation needed ]  Many emigrants from South Africa also state that crime was a big motivator for them to leave.  Crime against the farming community  has continued to be a major problem. [ 86 ]     Skills migration   Along with many African nations, South Africa has been experiencing a "" brain drain "" in the past 20 years. This is believed to be potentially damaging for the regional economy, [ 87 ]  and is almost certainly detrimental for the well-being of the majority of people reliant on the healthcare infrastructure, given the HIV/AIDS epidemic. [ 88 ]  The skills drain in South Africa tends to demonstrate racial contours (naturally given the skills distribution legacy of South Africa) and has thus resulted in large white South African communities abroad. [ 89 ]     Xenophobia   Main article:  Xenophobia in South Africa   In May 2008 long standing state hostility to African migrants exploded in a series of pogroms that left up to 100 people dead and 100,000 displaced.

Located relatively         close to South America the nation of Barbados is around 434.5 kilometres         (270 miles) northeast of the South American nation of Venezuela.                                           The         closest island neighbours to Barbados are Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent         and the Grenadines both located to the west Trinidad and Tobago to the         south and Grenada to the south-west. Barbados is part of Lesser         Antilles.                                                                   Barbados                      coat of arms                                                       Barbados         possesses a land area of around 430 square kilometres, (166 sq. mi), and         is primarily low-lying, with some higher regions in the island's         interior. The organic composition of Barbados is thought to be of         non-volcanic origin and is predominantly composed of limestone-coral.         The island's atmosphere is sub-tropical with constant trade winds off         the Atlantic Ocean and some undeveloped areas contain marshes and         mangrove swamps. Other parts of the island's interior contributing the         island's agricultural sector are dotted with large sugarcane estates and         wide gently sloping pastures with many good views down to the sea.                                           Barbados         has one of the highest standards of living and literacy rates in the         developing world and, according to the  United         Nations  Development Programme (UNDP), Barbados is currently the No.         4 most developed of all developing countries in the world. Despite its         small geographical size, Barbados constantly ranks in the top 30 (or 31)         countries in the HDI (Human Development Index) rankings. The island is         also a major tourist destination.                                                       History                       The         earliest inhabitants of Barbados were Amerindian nomads. Three waves of         migrants moved north toward North America. The first wave was of the         Saladoid-Barrancoid group, who were farmers, fishermen, and ceramists         that arrived by canoe from South America (Venezuela's Orinoco Valley)         around 350 CE. The Arawak people were the second wave of migrants,         arriving from South America around 800 CE. Arawak settlements on the         island include Stroud Point, Chandler Bay, Saint Luke's Gully, and         Mapp's Cave. According to accounts by descendants of the aboriginal         Arawak tribes on other local islands, the original name for Barbados was          Ichirouganaim . In the 13th century, the Caribs arrived from South         America in the third wave, displacing both the Arawak and the         Salodoid-Barrancoid. For the next few centuries, the Caribsike the         Arawak and the Salodoid-Barrancoidived in isolation on the island.                                           The         name ""Barbados"" comes from a Portuguese explorer named Pedro         Campos in 1536, who originally called the island  Os Barbados          (""The Bearded Ones"") upon seeing the appearance of the         island's fig trees whose long hanging aerial roots, he thought,         resembled beards. Between Campos' sighting in 1536 and 1550, Spanish         conquistadors seized many Caribs on Barbados and used them as slave         labour on plantations. Other Caribs fled the island, moving elsewhere.                                           British         sailors who landed on Barbados in the 1620s at the site of present-day         Holetown on the Caribbean coast found the island uninhabited. From the         arrival of the first British settlers in 1627628 until independence         in 1966, Barbados was under uninterrupted British control. Nevertheless,         Barbados always enjoyed a large measure of local autonomy. Its House of         Assembly began meeting in 1639. Among the initial important British         figures was Sir William Courten.                                           Starting         in the 1620s an increasing number of black slaves were brought to the         isle. 5000 locals died of fever in 1647, and hundreds of slaves were         executed by Royalist planters during the English Civil War in the 1640s,         as they feared that the ideas of the Levellers might spread to the slave         population if  Parliament          took control of Barbados.                                           Large         numbers of Celtic people, mainly from Ireland and Scotland, went to         Barbados as indentured servants. Over the next several centuries the         Celtic population was used as a buffer between the Anglo-Saxon         plantation owners and the larger African population, variously serving         as members of the Colonial militia and playing a strong role as allies         of the larger African slave population in a long string of colonial         rebellions. As well, in 1659, the English shipped many Irishmen and         Scots off to Barbados as slaves. With King James II, and other kings in         his dynasty, also sending Scots, and English, off to the isle. For         instance in 1685, after the crushing of the Monmouth Rebellion. The         modern descendants of this original slave population are sometimes         derisively referred to as Red Legs, or locally 'ecky becky' and are some         of the poorest inhabitants of modern Barbados. There has also been large         scale intermarriage between the African and Celtic populations on the         islands. Because the Africans could withstand tropical diseases and the         climate much better than the white slave population, and also because         those poor whites who had or acquired the means to emigrate often did         so, Barbados turned from mainly Celtic in the 17th century to         overwhelmingly black by the 20th century.                                           As         the  sugar  industry         developed into the main commercial enterprise, Barbados was divided into         large plantation estates that replaced the small holdings of the early         British settlers. Some of the displaced farmers relocated to British         colonies in North America, most notably South Carolina. To work the         plantations, West Africans were transported and enslaved on Barbados and         other Caribbean islands. The slave trade ceased in 1804. Slaves though         carried on being oppressed, causing, in 1816, the major slave rebellion,         in the isle's history. One thousand people died in the revolt for         freedom, with 144 slaves executed, and 123 deported, by the king's army.         Eighteen years later slavery was abolished in the British Empire in         1834. In Barbados and the rest of the British West Indian colonies, full         emancipation from slavery was preceded by an apprenticeship period that         lasted six years.                                           However,         plantation owners and merchants of British descent still dominated local         politics, due to the high income qualification required for voters. More         than 70% of the population, many of them disenfranchised women, were         excluded from the democratic process. It was not until the 1930s that         the descendants of emancipated slaves began a movement for political         rights. One of the leaders of this movement, Sir Grantley Adams, founded         the Barbados Labour Party, then known as the Barbados Progressive         League, in 1938. Though a staunch supporter of the monarchy, Adams and         his party demanded more for the poor and for the people. Progress toward         a more democratic government in Barbados was made in 1942, when the         exclusive income qualification was lowered and women were given the         right to vote. By 1949 governmental control was wrestled from the         planters and, in 1958, Adams became Premier of Barbados.                                           From         1958 to 1962, Barbados was one of the ten members of the West Indies         Federation, an organisation doomed by nationalistic attitude and by the         fact that its members, as colonies of Britain, held limited legislative         power. Adams' leadership of the Federation (he served as its first and         only ""Prime Minister""), his failed attempts to form similar         unions, and his continued defence of the monarchy demonstrated that he         was no longer in touch with the needs of his country. Errol Walton         Barrow, a fervent reformer, was to become the new people's advocate.         Barrow had left the BLP and formed the Democratic Labour Party as a         liberal alternative to Adams' conservative government. To this day,         Barrow remains a beloved hero in the eyes of Barbadians, as it was he         who instituted many of the reforms and programs currently in place,         including free education for all Barbadians, regardless of class or         colour, and the School Meals system. By 1961, Barrow had replaced Adams         as Premier and the DLP controlled the government.                                           With         the Federation dissolved, Barbados had reverted to its former status,         that of a self-governing colony. The island negotiated its own         independence at a constitutional conference with the United Kingdom in         June 1966. After years of peaceful and democratic progress, Barbados         finally became an independent state within the Commonwealth of Nations         on  November  30, 1966,         with Errol Barrow serving as its first Prime Minister.                                                                             Map         of Barbados                                                       Politics                                           Barbados         is a parliamentary democracy. Executive authority is vested in the Prime         Minister and Cabinet, which is collectively responsible to the         Parliament. The Prime Minister is appointed by the Governor General as         the member of the House of Assembly best able to command the support of         the majority of the members. The Prime Minister usually selects a         cabinet from his party members in the legislature. The present         government is proposing that Barbados become a republic within the         Commonwealth of Nations, with a ceremonial president replacing the         British Sovereign. This issue is still being hotly debated as the island         has been governmentally autonomous for decades.                                           Barbados         has been an independent state in the Commonwealth since November 30,         1966, and as such functions as a parliamentary democracy modelled after         the British Westminster system. Control of the government is held by the         Cabinet and is responsible to the Parliament, which comrpises a 30-seat         House of Assembly and a 21-seat Senate. Barbados is one of the most         secure democracies in the Caribbean. Executive power is in the hands of         the prime minister and his cabinet. The prime minister is usually the         leader of the winning party in the elections for the House of Assembly,         whose members are elected every five years. The Senate has 21 members,         and its members are appointed by the governor general.                                           Barbados         is a full and participating member of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM),         the Caribbean (CARICOM) Single Market and Economy (CSME), the Caribbean         Court of Justice (CCJ) [which currently only pertains to Barbados and         Guyana, and is expected to replace the UK Privy Council for the entire         English speaking Caribbean eventually], and the Association of Caribbean         States (ACS).                                                                   Geography                                           Barbados         is a relatively flat island, rising gently to the central highland         region, the highest point being Mount Hillaby, in the Scotland district,         at 336  metres          (1,100 ft) above sea level. The island is located in a slightly         eccentric position in the Atlantic Ocean, to the east of the other         Caribbean islands. The climate is tropical, with a rainy season from         June to October.                                           Barbados         is often spared from the amount of tropical storms and hurricanes during         the rainy season due to its far eastern location in the Atlantic Ocean         pushing it just outside of the principal  hurricane          belt. The island does get brushed or hit about every 3 years and the         average number of years between direct hurricane hits is about once         every 26.6 years.                                           In         the parish of Saint Michael lies Barbados' capital and chief city         Bridgetown. Locally Bridgetown is sometimes referred to as ""The         City,"" but the most common reference is simply ""Town"".         Other towns scattered across the island include Holetown, in the parish         of Saint James; Oistins, in the parish of Christ Church; and         Speightstown, in the parish of Saint Peter.                                           The         island is 23 kilometres (14 mi) at its widest point, and about 34         kilometres (21 mi) long.                                                       LINKS         and RESOURCES                       Government                                     Barbados             Government  - official             website                                                                                 Barbados                 Government Information Network                                                                         Parliament             of Barbados official website                           Parliament             of Barbados - Some facts about Barbados                           Central             Bank of Barbados website                           Barbados             Investment and Development Corporation                                                     Directories                                     Thatsbarbados.com                           Barbados             Vacation Travel Guide & Business Directory                           the             Barbados Webdirectory                           Points             and places of Interest when in Barbados                           Barbados             Chamber of Commerce and Industry                           Open             Directory Project -  Barbados              directory category                           Barbados             Scuba Diving photos              Barbados dive photo gallery + information                                                     Tourism                                     Thatsbarbados.com                           Totally             Barbados Tourism and Island Guide                           Official             website of The Barbados Tourism Authority                           Barbados             Tourism Investment Inc.

The main page is therefore the portal to  maps  and  cartography  on Wikimedia. That page contains links to entries by country, continent and by topic as well as general  notes and references .   Every entry has an introduction section in English. If other languages are native and/or official in an entity, introductions in other languages are added in separate sections. The text of the introduction(s) is based on the content of the Wikipedia encyclopedia. For sources of the introduction see therefore the Wikipedia entries linked to. The same goes for the texts in the history sections.   Historical maps are included in the continent, country and dependency entries.   For Burma, see Myanmar; Great Britain and Northern Ireland, see United Kingdom; Ivory Coast, see Cte d'Ivoire; Pridnestrovie, see Transnistria; Taiwan, see China, Republic of; Timor-Leste, see East Timor.   The status of various entities is disputed. See the content for the entities concerned.   The maps of former countries that are more or less continued by a present-day country or had a territory included in only one or two countries are included in the atlas of the present-day country. For example the Ottoman Empire can be found in the  Atlas of Turkey .

The South African coast stretches 2,798 kilometres (1,739 mi) [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  and borders both the  Atlantic  and  Indian   oceans . [ 7 ]  To the north of South Africa lie  Namibia ,  Botswana  and  Zimbabwe , to the east are  Mozambique  and  Swaziland , while the  Kingdom of Lesotho  is an independent  enclave  surrounded by South African territory. [ 8 ]   Modern human beings have inhabited South Africa for more than 100,000 years. [ 9 ]  A century and a half after the discovery of the  Cape Sea Route , the  Dutch East India Company   founded  a refreshment station at what would become  Cape Town  in 1652. [ 10 ]  Cape Town became a British colony in 1806. European settlement expanded during the 1820s as the  Boers  (original  Dutch ,  Flemish ,  German  and  French  settlers) and the British  1820 Settlers  claimed land in the north and east of the country. Conflicts arose among the Xhosa, Zulu and Afrikaner groups. However, the discovery of diamonds and later gold triggered the conflict known as the  Anglo-Boer War  as the Boers and the British fought for the control of the South African mineral wealth. Although the Boers were defeated, limited independence was given to South Africa in 1910 as a British dominion. Anti-British policies focused on ultimate independence which was achieved in 1961 when South Africa was declared a  republic . The leading  National Party  legislated for a continuation of racial segregation begun under Dutch and British colonial rule, Boer republics, and subsequent South African governments (and which in 1948 became legally institutionalised  segregation  known as  apartheid ), despite opposition both in and outside of the country. In 1990 the then president  F.W. de Klerk  began to dismantle this legislation, and in 1994 the first democratic election was held in South Africa. This election brought  Nelson Mandela  and the current ruling party, the  African National Congress  to power, and the country rejoined the  Commonwealth of Nations .   South Africa is known for its diversity in cultures, languages, and religious beliefs, and eleven official languages are recognised in its  constitution . [ 7 ]  English is the most commonly spoken language in official and commercial public life, however it is only the fifth most spoken home language. [ 7 ]  South Africa is ethnically diverse, with the largest  Caucasian ,  Indian , and  racially mixed  communities in Africa. Although 79.6% of the South African population is  Black , [ 2 ]  this category is neither culturally nor linguistically homogeneous, as people within this classification speak a number of different  Bantu languages , nine of which have official status. [ 7 ]  Midyear 2007, the South African population was estimated at 47.9 million.

(September 2008)       Main article:  History of South Africa   South Africa contains some of the oldest archaeological sites in the world. [ 11 ]   [ 12 ]  Extensive fossil remains at the  Sterkfontein ,  Kromdraai  and Makapansgat caves suggest that various  australopithecines  existed in South Africa from about three million years ago. [ 13 ]  These were succeeded by various species of  Homo , including  Homo habilis ,  Homo erectus  and modern humans,  Homo sapiens . Settlements of  Bantu -speaking peoples, who were  iron -using agriculturists and herdsmen, were already present south of the  Limpopo River  by the fourth or fifth century (see  Bantu expansion ) displacing and absorbing the original  KhoiSan  speakers. They slowly moved south and the earliest ironworks in modern-day  KwaZulu-Natal Province  are believed to date from around 1050. The southernmost group was the  Xhosa  people, whose language incorporates certain linguistic traits from the earlier KhoiSan people, reaching the  Fish River , in today's  Eastern Cape Province . These  Iron Age  populations displaced earlier people, who often had  hunter-gatherer  societies, as they migrated.     European colonisation          Painting of an account of the arrival of  Jan van Riebeeck , the first  European  to settle in South Africa, with  Devil's Peak  in the background       In 1487, the  Portuguese  explorer  Bartolomeu Dias  became the first European to reach the southernmost point of Africa. Initially named The Cape of Storms, The King of Portugal,  John II , renamed it the  Cabo da Boa Esperana  or  Cape of Good Hope  as it led to the riches of India. This great feat of navigation was later immortalised in  Cames ' epic Portuguese poem,  The Lusiads  (1572). In 1652, a refreshment station was established at the  Cape of Good Hope  by  Jan van Riebeeck  on behalf of the  Dutch East India Company .  Slaves  were brought from  Indonesia ,  Madagascar , and India as a labour source for the Dutch immigrants in  Cape Town . As they expanded east, the Dutch settlers eventually met the south-westerly expanding  Xhosa  people in the region of the  Fish River . A series of wars, called the  Cape Frontier Wars , ensued, mainly caused by conflicting land and livestock interests.   Great Britain  took over the  Cape of Good Hope  area in 1795 ostensibly to stop it falling into the hands of the Revolutionary French, but also seeking to use  Cape Town  in particular as a stop on the route to Australia and India. It was later returned to the Dutch in 1803, but soon afterwards the  Dutch East India Company  declared bankruptcy, and the British annexed the Cape Colony in 1806. The British continued the frontier wars against the Xhosa, pushing the eastern frontier eastward through a line of forts established along the Fish River and consolidating it by encouraging  British settlement . Due to pressure of  abolitionist  societies in Britain, the  British parliament  first stopped its global  slave trade  with the passage of the  Slave Trade Act 1807 , then abolished slavery in all its colonies with the  Slavery Abolition Act 1833 . During the 1830s, approximately 12 000  Boers  (later known as  Voortrekkers ), departed from the  Cape Colony , where they were subjected to British control, to the future Natal, Orange Free State and Transvaal regions. The Boers founded the  Boer Republics  - the  South African Republic  (Now  Gauteng ,  Limpopo ,  Mpumalanga  and  North West  provinces) and the  Orange Free State  ( Free State ).   The discovery of  diamonds  in 1867 and  gold  in 1884 in the interior encouraged economic growth and immigration, intensifying the subjugation of the indigenous people. These important economic resources did not only play a role between European and the indigenous population but also between the Boers and the British. [ 14 ]   The  Boer Republics  successfully resisted British encroachments during the  First Boer War  (18801881) using  guerrilla warfare  tactics, much better suited to local conditions. However, the British returned in greater numbers, more experience, and more suitable tactics in the  Second Boer War  (18991902). The Boers' attempt to ally themselves with  German South-West Africa  provided the British with yet another excuse to take control of the Boer Republics. [ citation needed ]           Boers  in combat (1881).         Independence   After four years of negotiating, the  Union of South Africa  was created from the  Cape  and  Natal  colonies, as well as the republics of  Orange Free State  and  Transvaal , on 31 May 1910, exactly eight years after the end of the Second Boer War. The newly created Union of South Africa was a  dominion . The  Natives' Land Act  of 1913 severely restricted the ownership of land by 'blacks', at that stage to a mere 7% of the country, although this amount was eventually increased marginally. [ 15 ]  The union was effectively granted independence from the United Kingdom with the passage of the  Statute of Westminster , which morphed the  British king's  position within South Africa into that of the distinct  King of South Africa . In 1934, the  South African Party  and  National Party  merged to form the  United Party , seeking reconciliation between Afrikaners and English-speaking ""Whites"", but split in 1939 over the entry of the Union into  World War II  as an ally of the United Kingdom, a move which the National Party strongly opposed.   In 1948, the  National Party  was elected to power, and intensified the implementation of racial segregation that had begun under Dutch and British colonial rule, and subsequent South African governments since the Union was formed. The Nationalist Government systematised existing segregationist laws, and the system of segregation became known collectively as  apartheid . Not surprisingly, this segregation also applied to the wealth acquired during rapid industrialisation of the 1950s, '60s, and '70s. While the White minority enjoyed the highest  standard of living  in all of Africa, often comparable to  First World  western nations, the Black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard, including income, education, housing, and life expectancy. On 31 May 1961, following a whites-only  referendum , the country became a  republic  and left the (British)  Commonwealth . The office of  Governor-General  was abolished and replaced with the position of  State President .   Apartheid became increasingly controversial, leading to widespread  sanctions ,  divestment  and growing unrest and oppression within South Africa. (See also the article on the  History of South Africa in the apartheid era .) A long period of harsh suppression by the government, and at times violent resistance,  strikes , marches, protests, and  sabotage  by bombing and other means, by various anti-apartheid movements, most notably the  African National Congress  (ANC), followed. In the late 1970s, South Africa began a programme of  nuclear weapons  development and in the following decade it produced six deliverable nuclear weapons. The rationale for the nuclear arsenal is disputed, but it is believed [ who? ]  that  Vorster  and  P.W. Botha  wanted to be able to catalyse American intervention in the event of a war between South Africa and the  Cuban -supported  MPLA  government of  Angola .     Democracy   In 1990 the  National Party  government took the first step towards negotiating itself out of power when it lifted the ban on the  African National Congress  and other  left-wing  political organisations, and released  Nelson Mandela  from prison after twenty-seven years' incarceration on a  sabotage  sentence. Apartheid legislation was gradually removed from the statute books, and South Africa also destroyed its nuclear arsenal and acceded to the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . The first  multi-racial elections  were held in 1994, which the ANC won by an overwhelming majority. It has been in power ever since.   In  post-apartheid South Africa , millions of South Africans, mostly black, continued to live in  poverty , though poverty among whites, previously rare, has increased greatly. [ 16 ]  While some have partly attributed this to the legacy of the apartheid system, increasingly many attribute it to the failure of the current government to tackle social issues, coupled with the monetary and fiscal discipline of the current government to ensure both redistribution of wealth and economic growth. Since the ANC-led government took power, the  United Nations   Human Development Index  of South Africa has fallen, while it was steadily rising until the mid-1990s. [ 17 ]  Some of this could possibly be attributed to the  AIDS   pandemic  and the failure of the government to take steps to address it, [ 18 ] some of it can also be pinpointed to a government policy of  redistribution of wealth . As a mitigating factor, the social housing policy of the current government has produced an improvement in living conditions.     Politics   Main articles:  Politics of South Africa ,  Government of South Africa , and  Law of South Africa          The  Union Buildings  in  Pretoria  is the home of the South African executive.       South Africa has three capital cities:  Cape Town , the largest of the three, is the  legislative  capital;  Pretoria  is the  administrative  capital; and  Bloemfontein  is the  judicial  capital. South Africa has a  bicameral   parliament : the  National Council of Provinces  (the  upper house ) has 90 members, while the  National Assembly  (the  lower house ) has 400 members. Members of the lower house are elected on a population basis by  proportional representation : half of the members are elected from national lists and the other half are elected from provincial lists. Ten members are elected to represent each province in the National Council of Provinces, regardless of the population of the province. Elections for both chambers are held every five years. The government is formed in the lower house, and the leader of the majority party in the National Assembly is the  President .   The primary sources of South Africa law are Roman-Dutch mercantile law and personal law with English Common law, as imports of Dutch settlements and  British colonialism . [ 19 ]  The first European based law in South Africa was brought by the  Dutch East India Company  and is called  Roman-Dutch law . It was imported before the  codification  of European law into the  Napoleonic Code  and is comparable in many ways to  Scots law . This was followed in the 19th century by  English law , both  common  and  statutory . Starting in 1910 with unification, South Africa had its own  parliament  which passed laws specific for South Africa, building on those previously passed for the individual member colonies.   Current South African politics are dominated by the  African National Congress  (ANC), which received 69.7% of the vote during the last  2004 general election  and 66.3% of the vote in the  2006 municipal election . The current  President of South Africa  is  Kgalema Motlanthe , who replaced  Thabo Mbeki  on 25 September 2008. Mbeki succeeded former President  Nelson Mandela  in 1999, and was re-elected for a second five year term in 2004, but announced his resignation on 20 September 2008.   The main challenger to the rule of the ANC is the  Democratic Alliance  party, which received 12.4% of the vote in the 2004 election and 14.8% in the 2006 election.  Helen Zille , (elected 6 May 2007), is the party leader; the previous leader was  Tony Leon . The formerly dominant  New National Party , which introduced apartheid through its predecessor, the  National Party , chose to merge with the ANC on 9 April 2005. Other major political parties represented in Parliament are the  Inkatha Freedom Party , which mainly represents  Zulu  voters, and the  Independent Democrats , who took 6.97% and 1.7% of the vote respectively, in the 2004 election.   Since 2004, the country has had many thousands of popular protests, some violent, making it, according to one academic, the ""most protest-rich country in the world"". [ 20 ]  Many of these protests have been organised from the growing  shanty towns  that surround South African cities.     Foreign relations and military   Main articles:  South African National Defence Force ,  Foreign relations of South Africa , and  South Africa and weapons of mass destruction   Since the end of apartheid, the South African foreign policy has focused on its African partners particularly in the  Southern African Development Community  (SADC) and the  African Union . South Africa has played a key role as a mediator in African conflicts over the last decade, such as in  Burundi , the  Democratic Republic of Congo , the  Comoros , and  Zimbabwe . After apartheid ended, South Africa was readmitted to the  Commonwealth of Nations . As the  Union of South Africa , South Africa was a founding member of the  United Nations  and the then Prime Minister  Jan Smuts  wrote the preamble to its constitution. South Africa is currently a non-permanent member of the  United Nations Security Council  and has attracted controversy by voting against a resolution criticising the  Burmese  government in 2006 and against the implementation of sanctions against  Zimbabwe  in 2008. South Africa is a member of the  Group of 77  and chaired the organisation in 2006. South Africa is a member of the  South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone ,  Southern African Customs Union ,  World Trade Organization ,  International Monetary Fund ,  G20  and  G8+5 .   The South African  armed forces , known as the  South African National Defence Force  (SANDF), was created in 1994. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  Previously known as the  South African Defence Force  (SADF), the new force is an all volunteer army and consists of the forces of the old SADF, as well as the forces of the African nationalist groups, namely  Umkhonto we Sizwe  (MK),  Azanian People's Liberation Army  (APLA), and the former  Bantustan  defence forces. [ 21 ]  The SANDF is subdivided into four branches, the  South African Army , the  South African Air Force , the  South African Navy , and the  South African Military Health Services . [ 23 ]   In recent years, the SANDF has become a major  peacekeeping  force in Africa, [ 24 ]  and has been involved in operations in  Lesotho , the  Democratic Republic of the Congo , [ 24 ]  and  Burundi , [ 24 ]  amongst others. It has also participated as a part of multi-national  UN  peacekeeping forces.   South Africa undertook a nuclear weapons programme in the 1970s [ 25 ]  and  may have conducted  a nuclear test over the  Atlantic  in 1979. [ 26 ]  It is the only African country to have successfully  developed nuclear weapons . It has become the first country (followed by Ukraine) with nuclear capability to voluntarily renounce and dismantle its programme and in the process signed the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty  in 1991. [ 25 ]     Provinces, districts and municipalities   Main articles:  Provinces of South Africa ,  Districts of South Africa , and  Municipalities of South Africa          Map showing the provinces and districts (numbered) of South Africa.             Northern Cape          North West          Gauteng          Limpopo          Mpumalanga            KwaZulu-Natal          Eastern Cape          Free State          Western Cape               When apartheid ended in 1994, the South African government had to integrate the formerly independent and semi-independent  Bantustans  into the political structure of South Africa. To this end, it abolished the four former provinces of South Africa ( Cape Province ,  Natal ,  Orange Free State , and  Transvaal ) and replaced them with nine fully integrated provinces. The new provinces are usually much smaller than the former provinces, which theoretically gives local governments more resources to distribute over smaller areas.   The nine provinces are further subdivided into  52 districts :  6 metropolitan  and  46 district municipalities . The 46 district municipalities are further subdivided into  231 local municipalities . The district municipalities also contain 20 district management areas (mostly game parks) that are directly governed by the district municipalities. The six metropolitan municipalities perform the functions of both district and local municipalities.

At 470,979  sq mi  (1,219,912 km), [ 27 ]  South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world (after  Mali ). It is comparable in size to  Colombia .  Njesuthi  in the  Drakensberg  at 3,408 m (11,424 ft) is the highest peak in South Africa.          View of the  Drakensberg mountains , the highest mountain range in South Africa.       South Africa has a generally  temperate climate , due in part to it being surrounded by the  Atlantic  and  Indian Oceans  on three sides, by its location in the climatically milder  southern hemisphere  and due to the average elevation rising steadily towards the north (towards the  equator ) and further inland. Due to this varied topography and oceanic influence, a great variety of climatic zones exist.   The climatic zones vary, from the extreme  desert  of the southern  Namib  in the farthest northwest to the lush  subtropical  climate in the east along the  Mozambique  border and the  Indian  ocean. From the east, the land quickly rises over a  mountainous   escarpment  towards the interior  plateau  known as the  Highveld . Even though South Africa is classified as  semi-arid , there is considerable variation in  climate  as well as  topography .   The interior of South Africa is a vast, rather flat, and sparsely populated  scrubland ,  Karoo , which is drier towards the northwest along the Namib desert. In contrast, the eastern coastline is lush and well-watered, which produces a climate similar to the tropics. The extreme southwest has a climate remarkably similar to that of the  Mediterranean  with wet winters and hot, dry summers, hosting the famous  Fynbos   Biome . This area also produces much of the  wine  in South Africa. This region is also particularly known for its wind, which blows intermittently almost all year. The severity of this wind made passing around the  Cape of Good Hope  particularly treacherous for sailors, causing many  shipwrecks . Further east on the south coast, rainfall is distributed more evenly throughout the year, producing a green landscape. This area is popularly known as the  Garden Route .          Satellite picture of South Africa       The  Free State  is particularly flat due to the fact that it lies centrally on the high plateau. North of the  Vaal River , the Highveld becomes better watered and does not experience subtropical extremes of heat.  Johannesburg , in the centre of the Highveld, is at 1,740 metres (5,709 ft) and receives an annual rainfall of 760 millimetres (30  in ). Winters in this region are cold, although  snow  is rare.   To the north of Johannesburg, the altitude drops beyond the escarpment of the Highveld, and turns into the lower lying Bushveld, an area of mixed dry forest and an abundance of wildlife. East of the Highveld, beyond the eastern escarpment, the Lowveld stretches towards the  Indian  ocean. It has particularly high temperatures, and is also the location of extended subtropical agriculture.   The high  Drakensberg mountains , which form the south-eastern escarpment of the Highveld, offer limited  skiing  opportunities in winter. The coldest place in South Africa is  Sutherland  in the western  Roggeveld Mountains , where midwinter temperatures can reach as low as 15 degrees  Celsius  (5  F ). The deep interior has the hottest temperatures: A temperature of 51.7 C (125 F) was recorded in 1948 in the  Northern Cape  Kalahari near  Upington . [ 28 ]   South Africa also has one possession, the small sub-Antarctic archipelago of the  Prince Edward Islands , consisting of  Marion Island  (290 km/112 sq mi) and Prince Edward Island (45 km/17.3 sq mi) (not to be confused with the  Canadian province of the same name ).           Weather averages for Cape Town, South Africa         Month   Jan   Feb   Mar   Apr   May   Jun   Jul   Aug   Sep   Oct   Nov   Dec   Year       Average high C (F)   27  (81)   28  (82)   26  (79)   24  (75)   20  (68)   18  (64)   17  (63)   18  (64)   19  (66)   22  (72)   24  (75)   26  (79)   28  (82)       Average low C (F)   16  (61)   16  (61)   15  (59)   13  (55)   10  (50)   8  (46)   8  (46)   8  (46)   9  (48)   11  (52)   14  (57)   15  (59)   8  (46)       Precipitation  mm (inches)   16.5  (0.65)   13  (0.51)   20  (0.79)   54  (2.13)   92  (3.62)   111  (4.37)   96  (3.78)   87  (3.43)   56  (2.2)   40  (1.57)   24  (0.94)   18  (0.71)   627  (24.69)       Source: EuroWEATHER [ 29 ]  2008-02-22         Flora and fauna   See also:  Wildlife of South Africa   See also:  Protected areas of South Africa           Fynbos , a  floral kingdom  unique to South Africa, is found near  Cape Town               Swartberg  mountains near the town of  Oudtshoorn              A field of flowers in Weskus National Park.       South Africa is one of only 17 countries worldwide considered  megadiverse . It has more than 20,000 different  plants , or about 10% of all the known  species  of plants on  Earth , making it particularly rich in plant biodiversity. South Africa is the 6th most biodiverse country, [ 30 ]  after  Brazil ,  Colombia ,  Indonesia ,  China , and  Mexico . The most prevalent biome in South Africa is the  grassland , particularly on the  Highveld , where the plant cover is dominated by different  grasses , low  shrubs , and  acacia trees , mainly camel-thorn and whitethorn.  Vegetation  becomes even more sparse towards the northwest due to low  rainfall . There are several species of water-storing  succulents  like  aloes  and euphorbias in the very hot and dry  Namaqualand  area. The grass and thorn  savannah  turns slowly into a bush savannah towards the north-east of the country, with denser growth. There are significant numbers of  baobab  trees in this area, near the northern end of  Kruger National Park . [ 31 ]   The  Fynbos   Biome , which makes up the majority of the area and plant life in the  Cape floristic region , one of the six  floral kingdoms , is located in a small region of the  Western Cape  and contains more than 9,000 of those species, making it among the richest regions on earth in terms of floral biodiversity. The majority of the plants are  evergreen  hard-leaf plants with fine, needle-like  leaves , such as the  sclerophyllous  plants. Another uniquely South African plant is the  protea  genus of flowering plants. There are around 130 different species of protea in South Africa.   While South Africa has a great wealth of flowering plants, it has few  forests . Only 1% of South Africa is forest, almost exclusively in the  humid   coastal plain  along the  Indian Ocean  in  KwaZulu-Natal  (see  KwaZulu-Cape coastal forest mosaic ). There are even smaller reserves of forests that are out of the reach of  fire , known as montane forests (see  Knysna-Amatole montane forests ).  Plantations  of imported tree species are predominant, particularly the non-native  eucalyptus  and  pine . South Africa has lost a large area of natural habitat in the last four decades, primarily due to  overpopulation , sprawling development patterns and  deforestation  during the nineteenth century. South Africa is one of the worst affected countries in the world when it comes to invasion by alien species with many (e.g.  Black Wattle ,  Port Jackson ,  Hakea ,  Lantana  and  Jacaranda ) posing a significant threat to the native  biodiversity  and the already scarce water resources. The original  temperate forest  that met the first European settlers to South Africa was exploited ruthlessly until only small patches remained. Currently, South African  hardwood  trees like  Real Yellowwood   (Podocarpus latifolius) ,  stinkwood   (Ocotea bullata) , and South African  Black Ironwood   (Olea laurifolia)  are under government protection.   Numerous  mammals  are found in the  bushveld  habitats including  lions ,  leopards ,  white rhinos ,  blue wildebeest ,  kudus ,  impalas ,  hyenas ,  hippopotamus  and  giraffes . A significant extent of the bushveld habitat exists in the north-east including  Kruger National Park  and the  Mala Mala  Reserve, as well as in the far north in the  Waterberg Biosphere .   Climate change is expected to bring considerable warming and drying to much of this already semi-arid region, with greater frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, flooding and drought. According to computer generated climate modelling produced by the South African National Biodiversity Institute [ 32 ]  parts of southern Africa will see an increase in temperature by about one degree Celsius along the coast to more than four degrees Celsius in the already hot hinterland such as the  Northern Cape  in late spring and summertime by 2050.   The Cape Floral Kingdom has been identified as one of the global  biodiversity hotspots  since it will be hit very hard by  climate change  and has such a great diversity of life. Drought, increased intensity and frequency of fire and climbing temperatures are expected to push many of these  rare species  towards  extinction .   South Africa houses many endemic species, among them the  critically endangered   Riverine Rabbit  ( Bunolagus monticullaris ) in the  Karoo .     Economy   Main article:  Economy of South Africa          The  Victoria & Alfred Waterfront  in  Cape Town  with  Table Mountain  in the background. Cape Town has become an important  retail  and  tourism  centre for the country, and attracts the largest number of foreign visitors in South Africa       By  UN  classification South Africa is a middle-income country with an abundant supply of resources, well-developed financial, legal, communications, energy, and transport sectors, a  stock exchange  (the  JSE Limited ), that ranks among the top twenty in the world, and a modern infrastructure supporting an efficient distribution of goods to major urban centres throughout the entire region. South Africa is ranked 25th in the world in terms of  GDP  (PPP) as of 2007.   Advanced development is significantly localised around four areas: Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Durban, and Pretoria/Johannesburg. Beyond these four economic centres, development is marginal and poverty is still prevalent despite government efforts. Consequently the vast majority of South Africans are poor. However, key marginal areas have experienced rapid growth recently. Such areas include Mossel Bay to Plettenberg Bay; Rustenburg area; Nelspruit area; Bloemfontein; Cape West Coast; and the KwaZulu-Natal North Coast.   Even though South Africa has the seventh highest per capita income in Africa, only behind  Libya ,  Mauritius  it suffers from large income gaps and a  dual economy  marking it as a  developing country . South Africa has one of the highest rates of  income inequality  in the world. A decade of continual economic growth has helped to lower unemployment, but daunting economic and social problems remain. The average South African household income decreased considerably between 1995 and 2000. As for racial inequality,  Statistics South Africa  reported that in 1995 the average white household earned four times as much as the average black household. In 2000 the average white household was earning six times more than the average black household. [ 33 ]  The  affirmative action  policies have seen a rise in black economic wealth and an emerging black middle class. [ 34 ]  Other problems are crime, corruption, and  HIV / AIDS .   At the start of 2000, then President Thabo Mbeki vowed to promote economic growth and foreign investment by relaxing restrictive labour laws, stepping up the pace of  privatisation , and cutting unneeded governmental spending. His policies face strong opposition from organised  labour . South Africa is also the largest energy producer and consumer on the continent. South Africa is a popular tourist destination, and a substantial amount of revenue comes from tourism. [ 35 ]  Among the main attractions are the diverse and picturesque culture, the game reserves and the highly regarded local wines.   The South African  rand  (ZAR), is the most actively traded emerging  market currency  in the world. It has joined an elite club of fifteen currencies, the  Continuous linked settlement  (CLS), where forex transactions are settled immediately, lowering the risks of transacting across  time zones . The rand was the best-performing currency against the  United States dollar  (USD) between 2002 and 2005, according to the  Bloomberg  Currency Scorecard.   The volatility of the  rand  has affected economic activity, falling sharply during 2001 and hitting a historic low of 13.85  ZAR  to the  USD , raising fears of inflation, and causing the Reserve Bank to increase  interest rates . The rand has since recovered, trading at 7.13 ZAR to the dollar as of January 2008. However, as exporters are put under considerable pressure from a stronger domestic currency, many call for government intervention to help soften the rand.   Refugees from poorer neighbouring countries include many immigrants from the DRC, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Malawi and others, representing a large portion of the informal sector. With high unemployment levels amongst poorer South Africans,  xenophobia  is prevalent and many people born in South Africa feel resentful of immigrants who are seen to be depriving the native population of jobs, a feeling which has been given credibility by the fact that many South African employers have employed migrants from other countries for lower pay than South African citizens, especially in the  construction ,  tourism ,  agriculture  and  domestic service  industries. Illegal immigrants are also heavily involved in informal trading. [ 36 ]  However, many immigrants to South Africa continue to live in poor conditions, and the South African immigration policy has become increasingly restrictive since 1994. [ 37 ]   Principal international trading partners of South Africa  besides other African countries  include  Germany , the  United States ,  China ,  Japan , the  United Kingdom  and  Spain .  [ 38 ]  Chief exports include  corn ,  diamonds ,  fruits ,  gold ,  metals  and  minerals ,  sugar , and  wool .  Machinery  and transportation equipment make up more than one-third of the value of the countrys imports. Other imports include  chemicals , manufactured goods, and  petroleum .     Electricity crisis   After unsuccessful attempts by the government to encourage private construction of electricity generation capacity, in 2007 the state-owned electricity supplier ( Eskom ) started experiencing a lack of capacity in the electrical generating and reticulation infrastructure. This led to an inability to meet the routine demands of industry and consumers, resulting in countrywide  rolling blackouts . Initially the lack of capacity was triggered by a failure at  Koeberg nuclear power station , but since then a general lack of capacity became evident. The supplier has been widely criticised for failing to adequately plan for and construct sufficient electrical generating capacity, [ 39 ]  although ultimately the government has admitted that it is at fault for refusing to approve funding for investment in infrastructure. [ 40 ]     Agriculture          Workers planting on a farm in the central area of  Mpumalanga .               Farm  workers.       South Africa has a large agricultural sector and is a net exporter of  farming  products. There are almost a thousand  agricultural cooperatives  and  agribusinesses  throughout the country, and agricultural exports have constituted 8% of South African total exports for the past five years. The agricultural industry contributes around 10% of formal employment, relatively low compared to other parts of Africa, as well as providing work for casual labourers and contributing around 2.6% of  GDP  for the nation. [ 41 ]  However, due to the  aridity  of the land, only 13.5% can be used for crop production, and only 3% is considered high potential land. [ 42 ]   Although the commercial farming sector is relatively well developed, people in some rural areas still survive on  subsistence agriculture . It is the eighth largest wine producer in the world, and the eleventh largest producer of sunflower seed. South Africa is a net exporter of agricultural products and foodstuffs, the largest number of exported items being  sugar ,  grapes ,  citrus ,  nectarines ,  wine  and  deciduous  fruit. The largest locally produced crop is  maize  (corn), and it has been estimated that 9 million tons are produced every year, with 7.4 million tons being consumed.  Livestock  are also popular on South African farms, with the country producing 85% of all meat consumed. The dairy industry consists of around 4,300 milk producers providing employment for 60,000 farm workers and contributing to the livelihoods of around 40,000 others. [ 43 ]   In recent years, the agricultural sector has introduced several reforms, some of which are controversial, such as  land reform  and the deregulation of the market for agricultural products. Land reform has been criticised both by farmers' groups and by landless workers, the latter alleging that the pace of change has not been fast enough, and the former alleging racist treatment and expressing concerns that a similar situation to  Zimbabwe's land reform policy  may develop, [ 44 ]  a fear exacerbated by comments made by  deputy president , the deputy president of South Africa. [ 45 ] [ 46 ]  The sector continues to face problems, with increased foreign competition and crime being two of the major challenges for the industry. The government has been accused of either putting in too much effort [ 47 ] , or not enough effort [ 48 ] , to tackle the problem of  farm attacks  as opposed to other forms of violent crime.   Another issue which affects South African agriculture is environmental damage caused by misuse of the land and global climate change. South Africa is unusually vulnerable to climate change and resultant diminution of surface waters. Some predictions show surface water supply could decrease by 60% by the year 2070 in parts of the Western Cape. [ 49 ]  To reverse the damage caused by land mismanagement, the government has supported a scheme which promotes  sustainable development  and the use of natural resources. [ 50 ]  Maize production, which contributes to a 36% majority of the gross value of South Africas field crops, has also experienced negative effects due to climate change. The estimated value of loss, which takes into consideration scenarios with and without the carbon dioxide fertilisation effect  [2]  ,ranges between 10s to 100s of millions of Rands.

South Africa is a nation of more than 48 million people of diverse origins,  cultures ,  languages , and  religions . The last  census  was held in 2001 and the next will be in 2011.  Statistics South Africa  provided five  racial  categories by which people could classify themselves, the last of which, ""unspecified/other"" drew negligible responses, and these results were omitted. [ 52 ]  The 2006 midyear estimated figures for the other categories were  Black African  at 79.5%,  White  at 9.2%,  Coloured  at 8.9%, and  Indian or Asian  at 2.5%. [ 53 ]  Even though the population of South Africa has increased in the past decade [ 52 ] [ 54 ]  (primarily due to immigration), the country had an annual population growth rate of 0.501% in 2008 (CIA est.), including immigration. [ 55 ]  South Africa is home to an estimated 5 million  illegal immigrants , including some 3 million  Zimbabweans . [ 56 ] [ 57 ] [ 58 ]  A series of  anti-immigrant riots  occurred in South Africa beginning on 11 May 2008. [ 59 ] [ 60 ]   By far the major part of the population classified itself as African or black, but it is not culturally or linguistically homogeneous. Major ethnic groups include the  Zulu ,  Xhosa ,  Basotho  (South Sotho),  Bapedi  (North Sotho),  Venda ,  Tswana ,  Tsonga ,  Swazi  and  Ndebele , all of which speak  Bantu languages  (see  Bantu peoples of South Africa ).   Some, such as the Zulu, Xhosa, Bapedi and Venda groups, are unique to South Africa. Other groups are distributed across the borders with neighbours of South Africa: The  Basotho  group is also the major ethnic group in  Lesotho . The  Tswana  ethnic group constitute the majority of the population of  Botswana . The  Swazi  ethnic group is the major ethnic group in  Swaziland . The  Ndebele  ethnic group is also found in  Matabeleland  in  Zimbabwe , where they are known as the  Matabele . These Ndebele people are the descendants of a Zulu faction under the warrior  Mzilikazi  that escaped persecution from  Shaka  by migrating to their current territory. The  Tsonga  ethnic group is also found in southern  Mozambique , where they are known as the Shangaan.   The white population is not ethnically homogeneous and descend from many ethnic groups:  Dutch ,  Flemish ,  Portuguese , German, French  Huguenot , English, Irish, Italian, Scottish and  Welsh . Culturally and linguistically, they are divided into the  Afrikaners , who speak  Afrikaans , and English-speaking groups, many of whom are descended from British and Irish immigrants (see  Anglo-African ). Many small communities that have immigrated over the last century retain the use of other languages. The  white population  is on the decrease due to a low birth rate and emigration; as a factor in their decision to emigrate, many cite the high  crime  rate and the  affirmative action  policies of the government. Since 1994, approximately 1 000 000 white South Africans have permanently emigrated. [ 61 ] [ 62 ] [ 63 ] [ 64 ]  Despite high emigration levels, a high level of non-South African white immigrants have settled in the country, in particular from countries such as  Britain  and  Zimbabwe . For example, by 2005, an estimated 212 000 British citizens were residing in South Africa. Since 2003, the numbers of British migrants coming to South Africa has risen by 50%. An estimated 20 000 British migrants moved to South Africa in 2007. There have also been a significant number of  white Zimbabwean  arrivals, fleeing their home country in light of the economic and political problems currently facing the country. As well as recent arrivals, a significant number of white Zimbabweans emigrated to South Africa in the wake of independence in Zimbabwe in 1980. Some of the more nostalgic members of the community are known in popular culture as "" Whenwes "", because of their nostalgia for their lives in  Rhodesia  ""when we were in Rhodesia"". [ 65 ]   The term  Coloured  is still largely used for the people of mixed race descended from slaves brought in from East and Central Africa, the indigenous  Khoisan  who lived in the  Cape  at the time, Bantus, Whites (mostly the  Dutch / Afrikaner  and British settlers) as well as an admixture of  Javanese ,  Malay , Indian,  Malagasy  and Asian blood (such as  Burmese ). The majority speak Afrikaans. Khoisan is a term used to describe two separate groups, physically similar: light-skinned and small in stature. The  Khoikhoi , who were called  Hottentots  by the Europeans, were pastoralists and were annihilated; the San, called  Bushmen  by the Europeans, were hunter-gatherers. Within the Coloured community, more recent immigrants will also be found: Coloureds from the former  Rhodesia  (now  Zimbabwe );  Namibia  and immigrants of mixed descent from India and  Burma  ( Anglo-Indians / Anglo-Burmese ) who were welcomed to the Cape when India and Burma received their Independence.   The major part of the South African  Asian  population is Indian in origin (see  Indian South Africans ); many of them descended from indentured workers brought in the nineteenth century to work on the  sugar   plantations  of the eastern coastal area then known as  Natal . There is also a significant group of  Chinese South Africans  (approximately 100,000 individuals) and  Vietnamese  South Africans (approximately 50,000 individuals). In 2008, the Pretoria High Court has ruled that Chinese South Africans who arrived before 1994 are to be reclassified as  Coloureds . As a result of this ruling, about 12,000 - 15,000  [ 66 ] ethnically Chinese citizens who arrived before 1994, numbering 3%-5% of the total Chinese population in the country, will be able to benefit from government  BEE  policies. [ 67 ]   South Africa hosts a sizeable refugee and asylum seeker population. According to the  World Refugee Survey 2008 , published by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, this population numbered approximately 144,700 in 2007. [ 68 ]  Groups of refugees and asylum seekers numbering over 10,000 included people from  Zimbabwe  (48,400), The  Democratic Republic of the Congo  (24,800), and  Somalia  (12,900). [ 68 ]  These populations mainly lived in Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban, Cape Town, and Port Elizabeth. [ 68 ]     Science and technology   Several important scientific and technological developments have originated in South Africa.  The first human to human heart transplant was performed by cardiac surgeon  Christiaan Barnard  at  Groote Schuur Hospital  in December 1967  .  Max Theiler  developed a vaccine against Yellow Fever,  Allan McLeod Cormack  pioneered x-ray  Computed tomography , and  Aaron Klug  developed crystallographic electron microscopy techniques. These advancements were all recognised with  Nobel Prizes .  Sydney Brenner  won most recently, in 2002, for his pioneering work in  molecular biology .   Mark Shuttleworth  founded an early Internet security company  Thawte , that was subsequently bought out by world-leader  VeriSign . Despite government efforts to encourage entrepreneurship in biotechnology, IT and other high technology fields, no other notable groundbreaking companies have been founded in South Africa. However, it is the expressed objective of the government to transition the economy to be more reliant on high technology, based on the realisation that South African cannot compete with Far Eastern economies in manufacturing, nor can the republic rely on its mineral wealth in perpetuity.   South Africa has cultivated a burgeoning astronomy community. It hosts the  Southern African Large Telescope , the largest optical telescope in the southern hemisphere. South Africa is currently building the  Karoo Array Telescope  as a pathfinder for the $20 billion  Square Kilometer Array  project. South Africa is a finalist, with Australia, to be the host of the SKA.     Society and culture   Main article:  Culture of South Africa          Decorated houses,  Drakensberg Mountains              Traditional  South African cuisine .       It may be argued that there is no ""single"" culture in South Africa because of its ethnic diversity. Today, the diversity in foods from many cultures is enjoyed by all and especially marketed to tourists who wish to sample the large variety of South African cuisine. In addition to  food ,  music  and  dance  feature prominently.   South African cuisine  is heavily  meat-based  and has spawned the distinctively South African social gathering known as a  braai , or barbecue. South Africa has also developed into a major  wine  producer, with some of the best  vineyards  lying in valleys around  Stellenbosch ,  Franschoek ,  Paarl  and  Barrydale . [ 69 ]   There is great diversity in music from South Africa. Many black musicians who sang in Afrikaans or English during apartheid have since begun to sing in traditional African languages, and have developed a unique style called  Kwaito . Of note is  Brenda Fassie , who launched to fame with her song ""Weekend Special"", which was sung in English. More famous traditional musicians include  Ladysmith Black Mambazo , while the  Soweto String Quartet  performs classic music with an African flavour. White and Coloured South African singers are historically influenced by European musical styles including such western metal bands such as  Seether  (formerly Saron Gas). South Africa has produced world-famous jazz musicians, notably  Hugh Masekela ,  Jonas Gwangwa ,  Abdullah Ibrahim ,  Miriam Makeba ,  Jonathan Butler ,  Chris McGregor , and  Sathima Bea Benjamin .  Afrikaans  music covers multiple genres, such as the  contemporary   Steve Hofmeyr  and the  punk rock  band  Fokofpolisiekar . Crossover artists such as  Johnny Clegg  and his bands  Juluka  and  Savuka  have enjoyed various success underground, publicly, and abroad.   The South African black majority still has a substantial number of rural inhabitants who lead largely impoverished lives. It is among these people, however, that cultural traditions survive most strongly; as blacks have become increasingly  urbanised  and  westernised , aspects of traditional culture have declined. Urban blacks usually speak English or  Afrikaans  in addition to their native tongue. There are smaller but still significant groups of speakers of  Khoisan languages  who are not included in the eleven official languages, but are one of the eight other officially recognised languages. There are small groups of speakers of  endangered languages , most of which are from the Khoi-San family, that receive no official status; however, some groups within South Africa are attempting to promote their use and revival.   The  middle class  lifestyle, predominantly of the white minority but with growing numbers of Black, Coloured and Indian people, [ 70 ]  is similar in many respects to that of people found in  Western Europe , North America and  Australasia . Members of the middle class often study and work abroad for greater exposure to the markets of the world.   Asians , predominantly of Indian origin, preserve their own cultural heritage, languages and religious beliefs, being either  Christian ,  Hindu  or  Sunni Muslim  and speaking English, with Indian languages like  Hindi ,  Telugu ,  Tamil  or  Gujarati  being spoken less frequently, but the majority of Indians being able to understand their mother tongue. The first Indians arrived on the famous  Truro ship  as  indentured labourers  in Natal to work the Sugar Cane Fields. There is a much smaller  Chinese  community in South Africa, although its numbers have increased due to immigration from  Republic of China  (Taiwan).   South Africa has also had a large influence in the  Scouting  movement, with many Scouting traditions and ceremonies coming from the experiences of  Robert Baden-Powell  (the founder of Scouting) during his time in South Africa as a military officer in the 1890s. The  South African Scout Association  was one of the first youth organisations to open its doors to youth and adults of all races in South Africa. This happened on 2 July 1977 at a conference known as  Quo Vadis . [ 71 ]   The South African music scene consists of  Kwaito , a new music genre that had developed in the mid 80s and has since developed to become the most popular social economical form of representation among the populous. Though some may argue that the political aspects of Kwaito has since diminished after  Apartheid , and the relative interest in politics has become a minor aspect of daily life. Some argue that in a sense,  Kwaito  is in fact a political force that shows activism in its apolitical actions. Today, major corporations like  Sony ,  BMG , and  EMI  have appeared on the South African scene to produce and distribute  Kwaito  music. Due to its overwhelming popularity, as well as the general influence of DJs, who are among the top 5 most influential types of people within the country,  Kwaito  has taken over radio, television, and magazines. [ 72 ]   Kwaito , much like most hip-hop has its own local flavor and originality. However, unlike when hip-hop first burst on the scene as a politically driven and rebellious underground movement, South Africans wanted to create a happier vibe. As the post-apartheid fog cleared, South African youth found their ""own voice in a style of music known as kwaito, spawning a new (and profitable) industry"". [ 73 ]  According to TIMEeurope magazine, ""The kwaito sound now regularly incorporates traditional African music, jazz, gospel, and even rock guitar, most notably on Mandoza's 2000 hit Nkalakatha, one of the few kwaito records to cross over onto traditionally white radio"". [ 74 ]  In the kwaito, the samples from old school  Jamaican dancehall , European house, etc.,  tempos  are changed, beats are added, and urban street slang is also incorporated. This local flavour of music more recently has been attacked for its lack of ingenuity and its betrayal of its roots. The melodies and the incorporation of sex and dance have since become very similar to the American standard. In addition Kwaito has been criticised for its absence of influential lyrical content. As Kwaito is still a developing genre, and since the South African population is only around 48 million, sales of only 25,000 CDs are required for ""gold"" certification in South Africa. [ 73 ]     Religion   Main article:  Religion in South Africa           St. Mark 's Anglican Cathedral.       According to the latest 2001 national census, Christians accounted for 79.7% of the population. This includes  Zion Christian  11.1%,  Pentecostal  ( Charismatic ) 8.2%,  Roman Catholic  7.1%,  Methodist  6.8%,  Dutch Reformed  6.7%,  Anglican  3.8%, and other Christian 36%.  Islam  accounted for 1.5% of the population,  Hinduism  about 1.3%, and  Judaism  0.2%. 15.1% had no religious affiliation, 2.3% were other and 1.4% were unspecified. [ 75 ] [ 76 ]   African Indigenous Churches were the largest of the  Christian  groups. It was believed that many of these persons who claimed no affiliation with any organised religion adhered to  traditional indigenous religions . Many peoples have  syncretic  religious practices combining Christian and indigenous influences. [ 77 ]   Islam in South Africa  itself is not known to pre-date the colonial period, despite the isolated contact neighbouring  Mozambique  had with  Arab  and  East African  traders. [ citation needed ]  There is no evidence that Islam was known to the  Zulu ,  Swazi , or  Xhosa  of the east coast prior to the colonial era. Many South African Muslims are described as  Coloureds , notably in the  Western Cape , especially those whose ancestors came as slaves from the Indonesian archipelago (the  Cape Malays ). Others are described as  Indians , notably in  KwaZulu-Natal , including those whose ancestors came as traders from  South Asia ; they have been joined by others from other parts of Africa as well as white or black South African converts. It is estimated that  Islam  is the fastest growing religion of conversion in the country, [ 78 ]  with the number of black  Muslims  growing sixfold, from 12,000 in 1991 to 74,700 in 2004. [ 79 ]   Hinduism  dates back to British Colonial period primarily but later waves of continuous immigrants from India have contributed to a sizeable Hindu population. Most Hindus are ethnically South Asian but there are many who come from mixed racial stock and many are converts with the efforts of Hindu missionaries such as ISKCON. Other religions in smaller numbers are  Sikhism ,  Jainism  and  Bah' Faith . [ 76 ]     Languages   Main article:  Languages of South Africa          Map showing principal South African languages by municipality. Lighter shades indicate a non-majority  plurality .             Afrikaans          Northern Sotho          Southern Sotho          Swati          Tsonga            Tswana          Venda          Xhosa          Zulu               South Africa has eleven  official languages : [ 80 ]   Sepedi ,  Sesotho ,  Setswana ,  siSwati ,  Tshivenda ,  Xitsonga ,  Afrikaans ,  English ,  isiNdebele ,  isiXhosa  and  isiZulu . In this regard it is  second only to India  in number. While each language is formally equal to every other, some languages are spoken more than others. According to the 2001 National Census, the three most spoken first home languages are Zulu (23.8%), Xhosa (17.6%) and Afrikaans (13.3%). [ 52 ]  Despite the fact that English is recognised as the language of commerce and science, it was spoken by only 8.2% of South Africans at home in 2001, an even lower percentage than in 1996 (8.6%). [ 52 ]   There are  eleven official names  for South Africa, one in each of the official national languages. The country also recognises eight non-official languages:  Fanagalo ,  Khoe ,  Lobedu ,  Nama ,  Northern Ndebele ,  Phuthi ,  San  and  South African Sign Language . [ citation needed ]  These non-official languages may be used in certain official uses in limited areas where it has been determined that these languages are prevalent. Nevertheless, their populations are not such that they require nationwide recognition.   Many of the ""unofficial languages"" of the  San  and  Khoikhoi  people contain regional  dialects  stretching northward into Namibia and Botswana, and elsewhere. These people, who are a physically distinct population from other Africans, have their own cultural identity based on their  hunter-gatherer  societies. They have been marginalised to a great extent, and many of their languages are in danger of becoming  extinct .   Many white South Africans also speak other European languages, such as  Portuguese  (also spoken by Angolan and Mozambican blacks), German, and  Greek , while some  Asians  and  Indians  in South Africa speak  South Asian  languages, such as  Tamil ,  Hindi ,  Gujarati ,  Urdu  and  Telugu .  French  is still widely spoken by French South Africans especially in places like  Franschhoek , where many South Africans are of French origin. South African French is spoken by less than 10,000 individuals. Congolese French is also spoken in South Africa by migrants.

Unverifiable  material may be challenged and removed.  (June 2008)       The main sports in South Africa are  soccer ,  rugby ,  cricket ,  boxing  and  lawn bowls . Other sports with significant support are  swimming ,  golf  and  netball .  Basketball ,  surfing  and  skateboarding  are popular among the youth.   Famous boxing personalities include Baby Jake  Jacob Matlala ,  Vuyani Bungu ,  Welcome Ncita ,  Dingaan Thobela ,  Gerrie Coetzee  and  Brian Mitchell . Football players who have excelled in international clubs include  Lucas Radebe  of  Leeds United  and  Quinton Fortune , formerly of  Manchester United ,  Benni McCarthy  and  Aaron Mokoena  of  Blackburn Rovers  and  Steven Pienaar  of  Everton . South Africa produced  Formula 1  motor racing's 1979 world champion  Jody Scheckter .   South Africa hosted and won the  1995 Rugby World Cup  at their first attempt and again won the  2007 Rugby World Cup  in  France . South Africa was only allowed to participate from 1995 since the end of  Apartheid . It followed the 1995 Rugby World Cup by hosting and winning the  1996 African Cup of Nations  football tournament. It also hosted the  2003 Cricket World Cup  and the  2007 World Twenty20 Championship . South Africa will be the host nation for the  2010 FIFA World Cup , which will be the first time the tournament is held on the African continent.   In 2004, the swim team of  Roland Schoeman ,  Lyndon Ferns ,  Darian Townsend  and  Ryk Neethling  won the gold medal at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, simultaneously breaking the world record in the 4x100 freestyle relay.  Penny Heyns  won Olympic Gold in the 1996  Atlanta Olympic Games .   In golf,  Gary Player  is generally regarded as one of the greatest golfers of all time, having won the  Career Grand Slam , one of five golfers to have done so. Other South African golfers to have successfully won a major tournament include  Bobby Locke ,  Ernie Els ,  Retief Goosen  and  Trevor Immelman .     Current issues     HIV/AIDS   Main article:  HIV/AIDS in South Africa   The spread of  AIDS  (acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome) is an alarming problem in South Africa with up to 31% of pregnant women found to be HIV infected in 2005 and the infection rate among adults estimated at 20%. [ 81 ]  The link between HIV, a virus spread primarily by sexual contact, and AIDS was long denied by prior president  Thabo Mbeki  and then health minister  Manto Tshabalala-Msimang , who insisted that the many deaths in the country are due to malnutrition, and hence poverty, and not HIV. [ 82 ]  In 2007, in response to international pressure, the government made efforts to fight AIDS. [ 83 ]  In September 2008 Thabo Mbeki was ousted by the ANC and  Kgalema Motlanthe  was appointed for the interim. One of Mr. Motlanthe's first actions was to replace Mrs. Tshabalala-Msimang with the current minister,  Barbara Hogan .   AIDS affects mainly those who are sexually active and is far more prevalent in the black population. Most deaths are people who are also economically active, resulting in many families losing their primary wage earners. This has resulted in many 'AIDS orphans' who in many cases depend on the state for care and financial support. [ 84 ]  It is estimated that there are 1,200,000 orphans in South Africa. [ 84 ]  Many elderly people also lose the support from lost younger members of their family. Roughly 5 million people are infected with the disease. [ 83 ]     Crime   Main article:  Crime in South Africa           Prison  buildings on  Robben Island       According to a survey for the period 19982000 compiled by the  United Nations , South Africa was ranked second for  murder  and first for  assaults  and  rapes  per capita. [ 85 ]  Total crime per capita is 10th out of the 60 countries in the data set.   Crime  has had a pronounced effect on society: many middle-class South Africans moved into  gated communities , abandoning the central business districts of some cities for the relative security of suburbs. This effect is most pronounced in  Johannesburg , although the trend is noticeable in other cities as well. [ citation needed ]  Many emigrants from South Africa also state that crime was a big motivator for them to leave.  Crime against the farming community  has continued to be a major problem. [ 86 ]     Skills migration   Along with many African nations, South Africa has been experiencing a "" brain drain "" in the past 20 years. This is believed to be potentially damaging for the regional economy, [ 87 ]  and is almost certainly detrimental for the well-being of the majority of people reliant on the healthcare infrastructure, given the HIV/AIDS epidemic. [ 88 ]  The skills drain in South Africa tends to demonstrate racial contours (naturally given the skills distribution legacy of South Africa) and has thus resulted in large white South African communities abroad. [ 89 ]     Xenophobia   Main article:  Xenophobia in South Africa   In May 2008 long standing state hostility to African migrants exploded in a series of pogroms that left up to 100 people dead and 100,000 displaced.

India's population of approximately 1.15 billion people (estimate for July, 2008) comprises approximately one-sixth of the world's population. India has more than two thousand  ethnic groups , and every major  religion  is represented, as are four major  families  of  languages  ( Indo-European ,  Dravidian ,  Austro-Asiatic  and  Tibeto-Burman languages ) as well as a  language isolate  (the  Nihali language [ 1 ]  spoken in parts of  Maharashtra ).   Further complexity is lent by the great variation that occurs across this population on social parameters such as income and education. Only the continent of  Africa  exceeds the linguistic, genetic and cultural diversity of the nation of India.

India has more  arable land  area than any country except the United States [ 3 ] , and  more water area  than any country except Canada and the United States. Indian life, therefore revolves mostly around agriculture and allied activities in small villages, where the overwhelming majority of Indians live. As per the 2001 census, 72.2% of the population [ 4 ]  lives in about 638,000 villages [ 5 ]  and the remaining 27.8% [ 6 ]  lives in over 5,100 towns and over 380 urban agglomerations. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Census       Main article:  List of states and territories of India by population       The most recent  census  of India was conducted in 2001 with the reference date of March 1 of that year. [ 8 ]  It was the 14th census in an unbroken series, and the 6th after  independence  in 1947 (with the exception that census could not be held for  Assam  in the 1981 and  Jammu & Kashmir  in 1951 and 1991). Eight censuses were performed under the  British Raj , the first one was carried out throughout the 1860s and completed in 1872 (The first non-synchronous census). After this, there has been a census every decade starting in 1881 (First synchronous census).   The total population as on 1 March 2001 was 1,027,015,247, making the 2001 census the first to count more than a billion Indians. [ 9 ]  The population had risen by 21.34% compared to the 1991 total. The proportion of female population had increased by 0.3 percentage points to 48.4% during 1991-2001. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Religious demographics       Main article:  Religion in India       80.5% of the Indians are  Hindus , with 13.4% of the population  Muslim , making India home to the third-largest  Muslim  population in the world after  Indonesia  and  Pakistan . India also contains the majority of the world's  Zoroastrians ,  Sikhs ,  Jains  and  Bah' . Other religious groups include  Christians  (2.3%),  Buddhists  (0.8%), Jains (0.4%), and  Jews .   Religious majorities vary greatly by state.  Jammu and Kashmir  and  Lakshadweep  are Muslim majority states;  Nagaland ,  Mizoram  and  Meghalaya  are Christian majority;  Punjab  is mostly Sikh;  Arunachal Pradesh  and  Sikkim  are mainly  Buddhist .

For example, an H under Gujarati implies a Hindu, Gujarati-speaking Indian of Indo-Aryan ancestry. However this is not a hard and fast rule. For example, in  South India  many members of the  Muslim  community are of  Arab ,  Iranians  or  Turks  origin, but have  Kannada  as their first language. This list excludes caste groups like the  Dalits  which is a socio-political identity across linguistic, religious and racial lines. Indeed, it should be noted that the terms ' Indo-Aryan ' and ' Dravidian ' refer more to the linguistic difference rather than racial differences.

India has a high commission in  London  and two consulates-general in  Birmingham  and  Edinburgh . The United Kingdom has a high commission in  New Delhi  and three deputy high commissions in  Mumbai ,  Chennai  and  Kolkata . Both countries are full members of the  Commonwealth of Nations . Since 1947, relations between the two countries have been mostly friendly and there are many areas in which both India and the UK seek stronger ties for mutual benefit. There are also strong cultural and social ties between the two nations. In India, English is one of the official languages, and  Cricket  is among the most popular sports. In the UK  Indian Cuisine  is hugely popular. Britain imports most of its tea from India, and there are a number of words of Indian origin in the English language. The UK has an ethnic Indian population of over 1 million.

In 1876, the area, which included modern India,  Pakistan , and  Bangladesh , became ""The Indian Empire"" (often known historically as the ' British Raj ') with British Monarch  Queen Victoria  proclaimed as ""Empress of India"" (a title held by her successors until 1947).     [ edit ]   Dominion of India (1947-1950)   Independence came in 1947 with the  Partition of India  into the  Dominion of India , and the  Dominion of Pakistan , within the  Commonwealth of Nations .  King George VI , who as British Monarch had been "" Emperor of India "", abandoned this title in 1947, and served as India's ceremonial head of state as 'King of India' (in much the same way, he also served as 'King of Pakistan'). In 1950 India became a Republic and the link with the British crown was severed.   The Dominion was part of the  Sterling Area .     [ edit ]   Republic of India (since 1950)   India remained in the Commonwealth of Nations after become a Republic, but diversified it's foreign relations beyond the former British Empire.   In particular, India became a major force within the  Non-Aligned Movement , which initially sought to avoid taking sides during the  Cold War . This contrasted with Britain's position as a founding member of  NATO , and key ally of the  United States .   However, relations between the two countries have generally been cordial.   Due mainly to post independence immigration, there are now over a million  people of Indian descent in the United Kingdom .     [ edit ]   Economy   India is the second largest foreign investor in the UK after the USA, and the UK is also a significant investor in India. There are many bilateral trade agreements between the two nations designed to strengthen ties. For example, in 2005, the Joint Economic and Trade Committee (JETCO) was inaugurated in New Delhi aimed at boosting two-way bilateral investments.     [ edit ]   Defense   Cooperation is undertaken under the Defence Consultative Group (DCG) formed in 1995. India and the UK cooperate in a number of ways. Joint Indo-UK exercises (a ten-day exercise Emerald Mercury was held in India in March 2005, the first of its kind between the two countries, which marked the biggest land deployment of British military personnel in India), research and technology and defence equipment collaboration. Britain supports Indias case for permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council as well as bilateral cooperation in civilian nuclear technology. The UK and India also cooperate on security and terrorism issues.     [ edit ]   Political   Politically, relations between India and the UK occur mostly through the multilateral organisations of which both are members, such as the  Commonwealth of Nations , the  World Trade Organisation  and the  Asian Development Bank . Britain was the first G8 nation to suggest that India, along with China, Brazil, Mexico and South Africa, be allowed to attend summits with the G8. Britain recently donated 825 million in aid to India for the development of India's Healthcare System and Educational System.   The  President of India   Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan  paid a  state visit  to the United Kingdom in June 1963.

India's population of approximately 1.15 billion people (estimate for July, 2008) comprises approximately one-sixth of the world's population. India has more than two thousand  ethnic groups , and every major  religion  is represented, as are four major  families  of  languages  ( Indo-European ,  Dravidian ,  Austro-Asiatic  and  Tibeto-Burman languages ) as well as a  language isolate  (the  Nihali language [ 1 ]  spoken in parts of  Maharashtra ).   Further complexity is lent by the great variation that occurs across this population on social parameters such as income and education. Only the continent of  Africa  exceeds the linguistic, genetic and cultural diversity of the nation of India.

India has more  arable land  area than any country except the United States, [ 3 ]  and  more water area  than any country except Canada and the United States. Indian life, therefore revolves mostly around agriculture and allied activities in small villages, where the overwhelming majority of Indians live. As per the 2001 census, 72.2% of the population [ 4 ]  lives in about 638,000 villages [ 5 ]  and the remaining 27.8% [ 6 ]  lives in over 5,100 towns and over 380 urban agglomerations. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Census   Main article:  List of states and territories of India by population   The most recent  census  of India was conducted in 2001 with the reference date of March 1 of that year. [ 8 ]  It was the 14th census in an unbroken series, and the 6th after  independence  in 1947 (with the exception that census could not be held for  Assam  in the 1981 and  Jammu & Kashmir  in 1951 and 1991). Eight censuses were performed under the  British Raj , the first one was carried out throughout the 1860s and completed in 1872 (The first non-synchronous census). After this, there has been a census every decade starting in 1881 (First synchronous census).   The total population as on 1 March 2001 was 1,027,015,247, making the 2001 census the first to count more than a billion Indians. [ 9 ]  The population had risen by 21.34% compared to the 1991 total. The proportion of female population had increased by 0.3 percentage points to 48.4% during 1991-2001. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Religious demographics   Main article:  Religion in India   80.5% of the Indians are  Hindus , with 13.4% of the population  Muslim , making India home to the third-largest  Muslim  population in the world after  Indonesia  and  Pakistan . India also contains the majority of the world's  Zoroastrians ,  Sikhs ,  Jains  and  Bah' . Other religious groups include  Christians  (2.3%),  Buddhists  (0.8%), Jains (0.4%), and  Jews .   Religious majorities vary greatly by state.  Jammu and Kashmir  and  Lakshadweep  are Muslim majority states;  Nagaland ,  Mizoram  and  Meghalaya  are Christian majority;  Punjab  is mostly Sikh;  Arunachal Pradesh  and  Sikkim  are mainly  Buddhist .   The table below summarizes the findings of the 2001 census with regards to religion in India:     All figures in %.

For example, an H under Gujarati implies a Hindu, Gujarati-speaking Indian of Indo-Aryan ancestry. However this is not a hard and fast rule. For example, in  South India  many members of the  Muslim  community are of  Arab ,  Iranians  or  Turks  origin, but have  Kannada  as their first language. This list excludes caste groups like the  Dalits  which is a socio-political identity across linguistic, religious and racial lines. Indeed, it should be noted that the terms ' Indo-Aryan ' and ' Dravidian ' refer more to the linguistic difference rather than racial differences.

It should be noted that  Indo-Aryan ,  Dravidian ,  Tibeto-Burman  and  Austro-Asiatic  are mainly linguistic terms and denote speakers of these linguistic groups.

India's population of approximately 1.15 billion people (estimate for July, 2008) comprises approximately one-sixth of the world's population. India has more than two thousand  ethnic groups , and every major  religion  is represented, as are four major  families  of  languages  ( Indo-European ,  Dravidian ,  Austro-Asiatic  and  Tibeto-Burman languages ) as well as a  language isolate  (the  Nihali language [ 1 ]  spoken in parts of  Maharashtra ).   Further complexity is lent by the great variation that occurs across this population on social parameters such as income and education. Only the continent of  Africa  exceeds the linguistic, genetic and cultural diversity of the nation of India.

India has more  arable land  area than any country except the United States, [ 3 ]  and  more water area  than any country except Canada and the United States. Indian life, therefore revolves mostly around agriculture and allied activities in small villages, where the overwhelming majority of Indians live. As per the 2001 census, 72.2% of the population [ 4 ]  lives in about 638,000 villages [ 5 ]  and the remaining 27.8% [ 6 ]  lives in over 5,100 towns and over 380 urban agglomerations. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Census   Main article:  List of states and territories of India by population   The most recent  census  of India was conducted in 2001 with the reference date of March 1 of that year. [ 8 ]  It was the 14th census in an unbroken series, and the 6th after  independence  in 1947 (with the exception that census could not be held for  Assam  in the 1981 and  Jammu & Kashmir  in 1951 and 1991). Eight censuses were performed under the  British Raj , the first one was carried out throughout the 1860s and completed in 1872 (The first non-synchronous census). After this, there has been a census every decade starting in 1881 (First synchronous census).   The total population as on 1 March 2001 was 1,027,015,247, making the 2001 census the first to count more than a billion Indians. [ 9 ]  The population had risen by 21.34% compared to the 1991 total. The proportion of female population had increased by 0.3 percentage points to 48.4% during 1991-2001. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Religious demographics   Main article:  Religion in India   80.5% of the Indians are  Hindus , with 13.4% of the population  Muslim , making India home to the third-largest  Muslim  population in the world after  Indonesia  and  Pakistan . India also contains the majority of the world's  Zoroastrians ,  Sikhs ,  Jains  and  Bah' . Other religious groups include  Christians  (2.3%),  Buddhists  (0.8%), Jains (0.4%), and  Jews .   Religious majorities vary greatly by state.  Jammu and Kashmir  and  Lakshadweep  are Muslim majority states;  Nagaland ,  Mizoram  and  Meghalaya  are Christian majority;  Punjab  is mostly Sikh;  Arunachal Pradesh  and  Sikkim  are mainly  Buddhist .

For example, an H under Gujarati implies a Hindu, Gujarati-speaking Indian of Indo-Aryan ancestry. However this is not a hard and fast rule. For example, in  South India  many members of the  Muslim  community are of  Arab ,  Iranians  or  Turks  origin, but have  Kannada  as their first language. This list excludes caste groups like the  Dalits  which is a socio-political identity across linguistic, religious and racial lines. Indeed, it should be noted that the terms ' Indo-Aryan ' and ' Dravidian ' refer more to the linguistic difference rather than racial differences.

India's population of approximately 1.15 billion people (estimate for July, 2008) comprises approximately one-sixth of the world's population. India has more than two thousand  ethnic groups , and every major  religion  is represented, as are four major  families  of  languages  ( Indo-European ,  Dravidian ,  Austro-Asiatic  and  Tibeto-Burman languages ) as well as a  language isolate  (the  Nihali language [ 1 ]  spoken in parts of  Maharashtra ).   Further complexity is lent by the great variation that occurs across this population on social parameters such as income and education. Only the continent of  Africa  exceeds the linguistic, genetic and cultural diversity of the nation of India.

India has more  arable land  area than any country except the United States, [ 3 ]  and  more water area  than any country except Canada and the United States. Indian life, therefore revolves mostly around agriculture and allied activities in small villages, where the overwhelming majority of Indians live. As per the 2001 census, 72.2% of the population [ 4 ]  lives in about 638,000 villages [ 5 ]  and the remaining 27.8% [ 6 ]  lives in over 5,100 towns and over 380 urban agglomerations. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Census   Main article:  List of states and territories of India by population   The most recent  census  of India was conducted in 2001 with the reference date of March 1 of that year. [ 8 ]  It was the 14th census in an unbroken series, and the 6th after  independence  in 1947 (with the exception that census could not be held for  Assam  in the 1981 and  Jammu & Kashmir  in 1951 and 1991). Eight censuses were performed under the  British Raj , the first one was carried out throughout the 1860s and completed in 1872 (The first non-synchronous census). After this, there has been a census every decade starting in 1881 (First synchronous census).   The total population as on 1 March 2001 was 1,027,015,247, making the 2001 census the first to count more than a billion Indians. [ 9 ]  The population had risen by 21.34% compared to the 1991 total. The proportion of female population had increased by 0.3 percentage points to 48.4% during 1991-2001. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Religious demographics   Main article:  Religion in India   80.5% of the Indians are  Hindus , with 13.4% of the population  Muslim , making India home to the third-largest  Muslim  population in the world after  Indonesia  and  Pakistan . India also contains the majority of the world's  Zoroastrians ,  Sikhs ,  Jains  and  Bah' . Other religious groups include  Christians  (2.3%),  Buddhists  (0.8%), Jains (0.4%), and  Jews .   Religious majorities vary greatly by state.  Jammu and Kashmir  and  Lakshadweep  are Muslim majority states;  Nagaland ,  Mizoram  and  Meghalaya  are Christian majority;  Punjab  is mostly Sikh;  Arunachal Pradesh  and  Sikkim  are mainly  Buddhist .   The table below summarizes the findings of the 2001 census with regards to religion in India:     All figures in %.   Gender Ratio*: no of females/1000 males   Others  including  Bah's ,  Jews , and  Parsis .

For example, an H under Gujarati implies a Hindu, Gujarati-speaking Indian of Indo-Aryan ancestry. However this is not a hard and fast rule. For example, in  South India  many members of the  Muslim  community are of  Arab ,  Iranians  or  Turks  origin, but have  Kannada  as their first language. This list excludes caste groups like the  Dalits  which is a socio-political identity across linguistic, religious and racial lines. Indeed, it should be noted that the terms ' Indo-Aryan ' and ' Dravidian ' refer more to the linguistic difference rather than racial differences.

The South African coast stretches 2,798 kilometres (1,739 mi) [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  and borders both the  Atlantic  and  Indian   oceans . [ 7 ]  To the north of South Africa lie  Namibia ,  Botswana ,  Zimbabwe ,  Mozambique  and  Swaziland , while the  Kingdom of Lesotho  is an independent  enclave  surrounded by South African territory. [ 8 ]   Modern human beings have inhabited South Africa for more than 100,000 years. [ 9 ]  A century and a half after the discovery of the  Cape Sea Route , the  Dutch East India Company   founded  a refreshment station at what would become  Cape Town  in 1652. [ 10 ]  Cape Town became a British colony in 1806. European settlement expanded during the 1820s as the  Boers  (original  Dutch ,  Flemish ,  German  and  French  settlers) and the British  1820 Settlers  claimed land in the north and east of the country. Conflicts arose among the Xhosa, Zulu and Afrikaner groups. However, the discovery of diamonds and later gold triggered the conflict known as the  Anglo-Boer War  as the Boers and the British fought for the control of the South African mineral wealth. Although the Boers were defeated, limited independence was given to South Africa in 1910 as a British dominion. Anti-British policies focused on ultimate independence which was achieved in 1961 when South Africa was declared a  republic . The leading  National Party  legislated for a continuation of racial segregation begun under Dutch and British colonial rule, Boer republics, and subsequent South African governments (and which in 1948 became legally institutionalized  segregation  known as  apartheid ), despite opposition both in and outside of the country. In 1990 the then president  F.W. de Klerk  began to dismantle this legislation, and in 1994 the first democratic election was held in South Africa. This election brought  Nelson Mandela  and the current ruling party, the  African National Congress  to power, and the country rejoined the  Commonwealth of Nations .   South Africa is known for its diversity in cultures, languages, and religious beliefs, and eleven official languages are recognised in its  constitution . [ 7 ]  English is the most commonly spoken language in official and commercial public life, however it is only the fifth most spoken home language. [ 7 ]  South Africa is ethnically diverse, with the largest  Caucasian ,  Indian , and  racially mixed  communities in Africa. Although 79.6% of the South African population is  Black , [ 2 ]  this category is neither culturally nor linguistically homogenous, as people within this classification speak a number of different  Bantu languages , nine of which have official status. [ 7 ]  Midyear 2007, the South African population was estimated at 47.9 million.

(September 2008)           Main article:  History of South Africa       South Africa contains some of the oldest archaeological sites in the world. [ 11 ]   [ 12 ]  Extensive fossil remains at the  Sterkfontein ,  Kromdraai  and Makapansgat caves suggest that various  australopithecines  existed in South Africa from about three million years ago. [ 13 ]  These were succeeded by various species of  Homo , including  Homo habilis ,  Homo erectus  and modern humans,  Homo sapiens . Settlements of  Bantu -speaking peoples, who were  iron -using agriculturists and herdsmen, were already present south of the  Limpopo River  by the fourth or fifth century (see  Bantu expansion ) displacing and absorbing the original  KhoiSan  speakers. They slowly moved south and the earliest ironworks in modern-day  KwaZulu-Natal Province  are believed to date from around 1050. The southernmost group was the  Xhosa  people, whose language incorporates certain linguistic traits from the earlier KhoiSan people, reaching the  Fish River , in today's  Eastern Cape Province . These  Iron Age  populations displaced earlier people, who often had  hunter-gatherer  societies, as they migrated.     European colonisation          Painting of an account of the arrival of  Jan van Riebeeck , the first  European  to settle in South Africa, with  Devil's Peak  in the background       In 1487, the  Portuguese  explorer  Bartolomeu Dias  became the first European to reach the southernmost point of Africa. Initially named The Cape of Storms, The King of Portugal,  John II , renamed it the  Cabo da Boa Esperana  or  Cape of Good Hope  as it led to the riches of India. This great feat of navigation was later immortalized in  Cames ' epic Portuguese poem,  The Lusiads  (1572). In 1652, a refreshment station was established at the  Cape of Good Hope  by  Jan van Riebeeck  on behalf of the  Dutch East India Company .  Slaves  were brought from  Indonesia ,  Madagascar , and India as a labour source for the Dutch immigrants in  Cape Town . As they expanded east, the Dutch settlers eventually met the south-westerly expanding  Xhosa  people in the region of the  Fish River . A series of wars, called the  Cape Frontier Wars , ensued, mainly caused by conflicting land and livestock interests.   Great Britain  took over the  Cape of Good Hope  area in 1795 ostensibly to stop it falling into the hands of the Revolutionary French, but also seeking to use  Cape Town  in particular as a stop on the route to Australia and India. It was later returned to the Dutch in 1803, but soon afterwards the  Dutch East India Company  declared bankruptcy, and the British annexed the Cape Colony in 1806. The British continued the frontier wars against the Xhosa, pushing the eastern frontier eastward through a line of forts established along the Fish River and consolidating it by encouraging  British settlement . Due to pressure of  abolitionist  societies in Britain, the  British parliament  first stopped its global  slave trade  with the passage of the  Slave Trade Act 1807 , then abolished slavery in all its colonies with the  Slavery Abolition Act 1833 . During the 1830s, approximately 12 000  Boers  (later known as  Voortrekkers ), departed from the  Cape Colony , where they were subjected to British control, to the future Natal, Orange Free State and Transvaal regions. The Boers founded the  Boer Republics  - the  South African Republic  (Now  Gauteng ,  Limpopo ,  Mpumalanga  and  North West  provinces) and the  Orange Free State  ( Free State ).   The discovery of  diamonds  in 1867 and  gold  in 1884 in the interior encouraged economic growth and immigration, intensifying the subjugation of the indigenous people. These important economic resources did not only play a role between European and the indigenous population but also between the Boers and the British. [ 14 ]   The  Boer Republics  successfully resisted British encroachments during the  First Boer War  (18801881) using  guerrilla warfare  tactics, much better suited to local conditions. However, the British returned in greater numbers, more experience, and more suitable tactics in the  Second Boer War  (18991902). The Boers' attempt to ally themselves with  German South-West Africa  provided the British with yet another excuse to take control of the Boer Republics. [ citation needed ]           Boers  in combat (1881).         Independence   After four years of negotiating, the  Union of South Africa  was created from the  Cape  and  Natal  colonies, as well as the republics of  Orange Free State  and  Transvaal , on 31 May 1910, exactly eight years after the end of the Second Boer War. The newly created Union of South Africa was a  dominion . The  Natives' Land Act  of 1913 severely restricted the ownership of land by 'blacks', at that stage to a mere 7% of the country, although this amount was eventually increased marginally. [ 15 ]  The union was effectively granted independence from the United Kingdom with the passage of the  Statute of Westminster , which morphed the  British king's  position within South Africa into that of the distinct  King of South Africa . In 1934, the  South African Party  and  National Party  merged to form the  United Party , seeking reconciliation between Afrikaners and English-speaking ""Whites"", but split in 1939 over the entry of the Union into  World War II  as an ally of the United Kingdom, a move which the National Party strongly opposed.   In 1948, the  National Party  was elected to power, and intensified the implementation of racial segregation that had begun under Dutch and British colonial rule, and subsequent South African governments since the Union was formed. The Nationalist Government systematised existing segregationist laws, and the system of segregation became known collectively as  apartheid . Not surprisingly, this segregation also applied to the wealth acquired during rapid industrialisation of the 1950s, '60s, and '70s. While the White minority enjoyed the highest  standard of living  in all of Africa, often comparable to  First World  western nations, the Black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard, including income, education, housing, and life expectancy. On 31 May 1961, following a whites-only  referendum , the country became a  republic  and left the (British)  Commonwealth . The office of  Governor-General  was abolished and replaced with the position of  State President .   Apartheid became increasingly controversial, leading to widespread  sanctions ,  divestment  and growing unrest and oppression within South Africa. (See also the article on the  History of South Africa in the apartheid era .) A long period of harsh suppression by the government, and at times violent resistance,  strikes , marches, protests, and  sabotage  by bombing and other means, by various anti-apartheid movements, most notably the  African National Congress  (ANC), followed. In the late 1970s, South Africa began a programme of  nuclear weapons  development and in the following decade it produced six deliverable nuclear weapons. The rationale for the nuclear arsenal is disputed, but it is believed [ who? ]  that  Vorster  and  P.W. Botha  wanted to be able to catalyse American intervention in the event of a war between South Africa and the  Cuban -supported  MPLA  government of  Angola .     Democracy   In 1990 the  National Party  government took the first step towards negotiating itself out of power when it lifted the ban on the  African National Congress  and other  left-wing  political organisations, and released  Nelson Mandela  from prison after twenty-seven years' incarceration on a  sabotage  sentence. Apartheid legislation was gradually removed from the statute books, and South Africa also destroyed its nuclear arsenal and acceded to the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . The first  multi-racial elections  were held in 1994, which the ANC won by an overwhelming majority. It has been in power ever since.   In  post-apartheid South Africa , millions of South Africans, mostly black, continued to live in  poverty , though poverty among whites, previously rare, has increased greatly. [ 16 ]  While some have partly attributed this to the legacy of the apartheid system, increasingly many attribute it to the failure of the current government to tackle social issues, coupled with the monetary and fiscal discipline of the current government to ensure both redistribution of wealth and economic growth. Since the ANC-led government took power, the  United Nations   Human Development Index  of South Africa has fallen, while it was steadily rising until the mid-1990s. [ 17 ]  Some of this could possibly be attributed to the  AIDS   pandemic  and the failure of the government to take steps to address it, [ 18 ] some of it can also be pinpointed to a government policy of  redistribution of wealth . As a mitigating factor, the social housing policy of the current government has produced an improvement in living conditions.     Politics       Main articles:  Politics of South Africa ,  Government of South Africa , and  Law of South Africa              The  Union Buildings  in  Pretoria  is the home of the South African executive.       South Africa has three capital cities:  Cape Town , the largest of the three, is the  legislative  capital;  Pretoria  is the  administrative  capital; and  Bloemfontein  is the  judicial  capital. South Africa has a  bicameral   parliament : the  National Council of Provinces  (the  upper house ) has 90 members, while the  National Assembly  (the  lower house ) has 400 members. Members of the lower house are elected on a population basis by  proportional representation : half of the members are elected from national lists and the other half are elected from provincial lists. Ten members are elected to represent each province in the National Council of Provinces, regardless of the population of the province. Elections for both chambers are held every five years. The government is formed in the lower house, and the leader of the majority party in the National Assembly is the  President .   The primary sources of South Africa law are Roman-Dutch mercantile law and personal law with English Common law, as imports of Dutch settlements and  British colonialism . [ 19 ]  The first European based law in South Africa was brought by the  Dutch East India Company  and is called  Roman-Dutch law . It was imported before the  codification  of European law into the  Napoleonic Code  and is comparable in many ways to  Scots law . This was followed in the 19th century by  English law , both  common  and  statutory . Starting in 1910 with unification, South Africa had its own  parliament  which passed laws specific for South Africa, building on those previously passed for the individual member colonies.   Current South African politics are dominated by the  African National Congress  (ANC), which received 69.7% of the vote during the last  2004 general election  and 66.3% of the vote in the  2006 municipal election . The current  President of South Africa  is  Kgalema Motlanthe , who replaced  Thabo Mbeki  on 25 September 2008. Mbeki succeeded former President  Nelson Mandela  in 1999, and was re-elected for a second five year term in 2004, but announced his resignation on 20 September 2008.   The main challenger to the rule of the ANC is the  Democratic Alliance  party, which received 12.4% of the vote in the 2004 election and 14.8% in the 2006 election.  Helen Zille , (elected 6 May 2007), is the party leader; the previous leader was  Tony Leon . The formerly dominant  New National Party , which introduced apartheid through its predecessor, the  National Party , chose to merge with the ANC on 9 April 2005. Other major political parties represented in Parliament are the  Inkatha Freedom Party , which mainly represents  Zulu  voters, and the  Independent Democrats , who took 6.97% and 1.7% of the vote respectively, in the 2004 election.   Since 2004, the country has had many thousands of popular protests, some violent, making it, according to one academic, the ""most protest-rich country in the world"". [ 20 ]  Many of these protests have been organised from the growing  shanty towns  that surround South African cities.     Foreign relations and military       Main articles:  South African National Defence Force ,  Foreign relations of South Africa , and  South Africa and weapons of mass destruction       Since the end of apartheid, the South African foreign policy has focused on its African partners particularly in the  Southern African Development Community  (SADC) and the  African Union . South Africa has played a key role as a mediator in African conflicts over the last decade, such as in  Burundi , the  Democratic Republic of Congo , the  Comoros , and  Zimbabwe . After apartheid ended, South Africa was readmitted to the  Commonwealth of Nations . As the  Union of South Africa , South Africa was a founding member of the  United Nations  and the then Prime Minister  Jan Smuts  wrote the preamble to its constitution. South Africa is currently a non-permanent member of the  United Nations Security Council  and has attracted controversy by voting against a resolution criticising the  Burmese  government in 2006 and against the implementation of sanctions against  Zimbabwe  in 2008. South Africa is a member of the  Group of 77  and chaired the organisation in 2006. South Africa is a member of the  South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone ,  Southern African Customs Union ,  World Trade Organization ,  International Monetary Fund ,  G20  and  G8+5 .   The South African  armed forces , known as the  South African National Defence Force  (SANDF), was created in 1994. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  Previously known as the  South African Defence Force  (SADF), the new force is an all volunteer army and consists of the forces of the old SADF, as well as the forces of the African nationalist groups, namely  Umkhonto we Sizwe  (MK),  Azanian People's Liberation Army  (APLA), and the former  Bantustan  defence forces. [ 21 ]  The SANDF is subdivided into four branches, the  South African Army , the  South African Air Force , the  South African Navy , and the  South African Military Health Services . [ 23 ]   In recent years, the SANDF has become a major  peacekeeping  force in Africa, [ 24 ]  and has been involved in operations in  Lesotho , the  Democratic Republic of the Congo , [ 24 ]  and  Burundi , [ 24 ]  amongst others. It has also participated as a part of multi-national  UN  peacekeeping forces.   South Africa undertook a nuclear weapons programme in the 1970s [ 25 ]  and  may have conducted  a nuclear test over the  Atlantic  in 1979. [ 26 ]  It is the only African country to have successfully  developed nuclear weapons . It has become the first country (followed by Ukraine) with nuclear capability to voluntarily renounce and dismantle its programme and in the process signed the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty  in 1991.

To this end, it abolished the four former provinces of South Africa ( Cape Province ,  Natal ,  Orange Free State , and  Transvaal ) and replaced them with nine fully integrated provinces. The new provinces are usually much smaller than the former provinces, which theoretically gives local governments more resources to distribute over smaller areas.   The nine provinces are further subdivided into  52 districts :  6 metropolitan  and  46 district municipalities . The 46 district municipalities are further subdivided into  231 local municipalities . The district municipalities also contain 20 district management areas (mostly game parks) that are directly governed by the district municipalities. The six metropolitan municipalities perform the functions of both district and local municipalities.

At 470,979  sq mi  (1,219,912 km), [ 27 ]  South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world (after  Mali ). It is comparable in size to  Colombia .  Njesuthi  in the  Drakensberg  at 3,408 m (11,424 ft) is the highest peak in South Africa.          View of the  Drakensberg mountains , the highest mountain range in South Africa.       South Africa has a generally  temperate climate , due in part to it being surrounded by the  Atlantic  and  Indian Oceans  on three sides, by its location in the climatically milder  southern hemisphere  and due to the average elevation rising steadily towards the north (towards the  equator ) and further inland. Due to this varied topography and oceanic influence, a great variety of climatic zones exist.   The climatic zones vary, from the extreme  desert  of the southern  Namib  in the farthest northwest to the lush  subtropical  climate in the east along the  Mozambique  border and the  Indian  ocean. From the east, the land quickly rises over a  mountainous   escarpment  towards the interior  plateau  known as the  Highveld . Even though South Africa is classified as  semi-arid , there is considerable variation in  climate  as well as  topography .   The interior of South Africa is a vast, rather flat, and sparsely populated  scrubland ,  Karoo , which is drier towards the northwest along the Namib desert. In contrast, the eastern coastline is lush and well-watered, which produces a climate similar to the tropics. The extreme southwest has a climate remarkably similar to that of the  Mediterranean  with wet winters and hot, dry summers, hosting the famous  Fynbos   Biome . This area also produces much of the  wine  in South Africa. This region is also particularly known for its wind, which blows intermittently almost all year. The severity of this wind made passing around the  Cape of Good Hope  particularly treacherous for sailors, causing many  shipwrecks . Further east on the south coast, rainfall is distributed more evenly throughout the year, producing a green landscape. This area is popularly known as the  Garden Route .          Satellite picture of South Africa       The  Free State  is particularly flat due to the fact that it lies centrally on the high plateau. North of the  Vaal River , the Highveld becomes better watered and does not experience subtropical extremes of heat.  Johannesburg , in the centre of the Highveld, is at 1,740 metres (5,709 ft) and receives an annual rainfall of 760 millimetres (30  in ). Winters in this region are cold, although  snow  is rare.   To the north of Johannesburg, the altitude drops beyond the escarpment of the Highveld, and turns into the lower lying Bushveld, an area of mixed dry forest and an abundance of wildlife. East of the Highveld, beyond the eastern escarpment, the Lowveld stretches towards the  Indian  ocean. It has particularly high temperatures, and is also the location of extended subtropical agriculture.   The high  Drakensberg mountains , which form the south-eastern escarpment of the Highveld, offer limited  skiing  opportunities in winter. The coldest place in South Africa is  Sutherland  in the western  Roggeveld Mountains , where midwinter temperatures can reach as low as 15 degrees  Celsius  (5  F ). The deep interior has the hottest temperatures: A temperature of 51.7 C (125 F) was recorded in 1948 in the  Northern Cape  Kalahari near  Upington . [ 28 ]   South Africa also has one possession, the small sub-Antarctic archipelago of the  Prince Edward Islands , consisting of  Marion Island  (290 km/112 sq mi) and Prince Edward Island (45 km/17.3 sq mi) (not to be confused with the  Canadian province of the same name ).           Weather averages for Cape Town, South Africa         Month   Jan   Feb   Mar   Apr   May   Jun   Jul   Aug   Sep   Oct   Nov   Dec   Year       Average high C (F)   27  (81)   28  (82)   26  (79)   24  (75)   20  (68)   18  (64)   17  (63)   18  (64)   19  (66)   22  (72)   24  (75)   26  (79)   28  (82)       Average low C (F)   16  (61)   16  (61)   15  (59)   13  (55)   10  (50)   8  (46)   8  (46)   8  (46)   9  (48)   11  (52)   14  (57)   15  (59)   8  (46)       Precipitation  mm (inches)   16.5  (0.65)   13  (0.51)   20  (0.79)   54  (2.13)   92  (3.62)   111  (4.37)   96  (3.78)   87  (3.43)   56  (2.2)   40  (1.57)   24  (0.94)   18  (0.71)   627  (24.69)       Source: EuroWEATHER [ 29 ]  2008-02-22         Flora and fauna     See also:  Wildlife of South Africa   See also:  Protected areas of South Africa             Fynbos , a  floral kingdom  unique to South Africa, is found near  Cape Town               Swartberg  mountains near the town of  Oudtshoorn              A field of flowers in Weskus National Park.       South Africa is one of only 17 countries worldwide considered  megadiverse . It has more than 20,000 different  plants , or about 10% of all the known  species  of plants on  Earth , making it particularly rich in plant biodiversity. South Africa is the 6th most biodiverse country, [ 30 ]  after  Brazil ,  Colombia ,  Indonesia ,  China , and  Mexico . The most prevalent biome in South Africa is the  grassland , particularly on the  Highveld , where the plant cover is dominated by different  grasses , low  shrubs , and  acacia trees , mainly camel-thorn and whitethorn.  Vegetation  becomes even more sparse towards the northwest due to low  rainfall . There are several species of water-storing  succulents  like  aloes  and euphorbias in the very hot and dry  Namaqualand  area. The grass and thorn  savannah  turns slowly into a bush savannah towards the north-east of the country, with denser growth. There are significant numbers of  baobab  trees in this area, near the northern end of  Kruger National Park . [ 31 ]   The  Fynbos   Biome , which makes up the majority of the area and plant life in the  Cape floristic region , one of the six  floral kingdoms , is located in a small region of the  Western Cape  and contains more than 9,000 of those species, making it among the richest regions on earth in terms of floral biodiversity. The majority of the plants are  evergreen  hard-leaf plants with fine, needle-like  leaves , such as the  sclerophyllous  plants. Another uniquely South African plant is the  protea  genus of flowering plants. There are around 130 different species of protea in South Africa.   While South Africa has a great wealth of flowering plants, it has few  forests . Only 1% of South Africa is forest, almost exclusively in the  humid   coastal plain  along the  Indian Ocean  in  KwaZulu-Natal  (see  KwaZulu-Cape coastal forest mosaic ). There are even smaller reserves of forests that are out of the reach of  fire , known as montane forests (see  Knysna-Amatole montane forests ).  Plantations  of imported tree species are predominant, particularly the non-native  eucalyptus  and  pine . South Africa has lost a large area of natural habitat in the last four decades, primarily due to  overpopulation , sprawling development patterns and  deforestation  during the nineteenth century. South Africa is one of the worst affected countries in the world when it comes to invasion by alien species with many (e.g.  Black Wattle ,  Port Jackson ,  Hakea ,  Lantana  and  Jacaranda ) posing a significant threat to the native  biodiversity  and the already scarce water resources. The original  temperate forest  that met the first European settlers to South Africa was exploited ruthlessly until only small patches remained. Currently, South African  hardwood  trees like  Real Yellowwood   (Podocarpus latifolius) ,  stinkwood   (Ocotea bullata) , and South African  Black Ironwood   (Olea laurifolia)  are under government protection.   Numerous  mammals  are found in the  bushveld  habitats including  lions ,  leopards ,  white rhinos ,  blue wildebeest ,  kudus ,  impalas ,  hyenas ,  hippopotamus  and  giraffes . A significant extent of the bushveld habitat exists in the north-east including  Kruger National Park  and the  Mala Mala  Reserve, as well as in the far north in the  Waterberg Biosphere .   Climate change is expected to bring considerable warming and drying to much of this already semi-arid region, with greater frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, flooding and drought. According to computer generated climate modelling produced by the South African National Biodiversity Institute [ 32 ]  parts of southern Africa will see an increase in temperature by about one degree Celsius along the coast to more than four degrees Celsius in the already hot hinterland such as the  Northern Cape  in late spring and summertime by 2050.   The Cape Floral Kingdom has been identified as one of the global  biodiversity hotspots  since it will be hit very hard by  climate change  and has such a great diversity of life. Drought, increased intensity and frequency of fire and climbing temperatures are expected to push many of these  rare species  towards  extinction .   South Africa houses many endemic species, among them the  critically endangered   Riverine Rabbit  ( Bunolagus monticullaris ) in the  Karoo .     Economy       Main article:  Economy of South Africa              The  Victoria & Alfred Waterfront  in  Cape Town  with  Table Mountain  in the background. Cape Town has become an important  retail  and  tourism  centre for the country, and attracts the largest number of foreign visitors in South Africa       By  UN  classification South Africa is a middle-income country with an abundant supply of resources, well-developed financial, legal, communications, energy, and transport sectors, a  stock exchange  (the  JSE Limited ), that ranks among the top twenty in the world, and a modern infrastructure supporting an efficient distribution of goods to major urban centres throughout the entire region. South Africa is ranked 25th in the world in terms of  GDP  (PPP) as of 2007.   Advanced development is significantly localised around four areas: Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Durban, and Pretoria/Johannesburg. Beyond these four economic centres, development is marginal and poverty is still prevalent despite government efforts. Consequently the vast majority of South Africans are poor. However, key marginal areas have experienced rapid growth recently. Such areas include Mossel Bay to Plettenberg Bay; Rustenburg area; Nelspruit area; Bloemfontein; Cape West Coast; and the KwaZulu-Natal North Coast.   Even though South Africa has the seventh highest per capita income in Africa, only behind  Libya ,  Mauritius  it suffers from large income gaps and a  dual economy  marking it as a  developing country . South Africa has one of the highest rates of  income inequality  in the world. A decade of continual economic growth has helped to lower unemployment, but daunting economic and social problems remain. The average South African household income decreased considerably between 1995 and 2000. As for racial inequality,  Statistics South Africa  reported that in 1995 the average white household earned four times as much as the average black household. In 2000 the average white household was earning six times more than the average black household. [ 33 ]  The  affirmative action  policies have seen a rise in black economic wealth and an emerging black middle class. [ 34 ]  Other problems are crime, corruption, and  HIV / AIDS .   At the start of 2000, then President Thabo Mbeki vowed to promote economic growth and foreign investment by relaxing restrictive labour laws, stepping up the pace of  privatisation , and cutting unneeded governmental spending. His policies face strong opposition from organised  labour . South Africa is also the largest energy producer and consumer on the continent. South Africa is a popular tourist destination, and a substantial amount of revenue comes from tourism. [ 35 ]  Among the main attractions are the diverse and picturesque culture, the game reserves and the highly regarded local wines.   The South African  rand  (ZAR), is the most actively traded emerging  market currency  in the world. It has joined an elite club of fifteen currencies, the  Continuous linked settlement  (CLS), where forex transactions are settled immediately, lowering the risks of transacting across  time zones . The rand was the best-performing currency against the  United States dollar  (USD) between 2002 and 2005, according to the  Bloomberg  Currency Scorecard.   The volatility of the  rand  has affected economic activity, falling sharply during 2001 and hitting a historic low of 13.85  ZAR  to the  USD , raising fears of inflation, and causing the Reserve Bank to increase  interest rates . The rand has since recovered, trading at 7.13 ZAR to the dollar as of January 2008. However, as exporters are put under considerable pressure from a stronger domestic currency, many call for government intervention to help soften the rand.   Refugees from poorer neighbouring countries include many immigrants from the DRC, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Malawi and others, representing a large portion of the informal sector. With high unemployment levels amongst poorer South Africans,  xenophobia  is prevalent and many people born in South Africa feel resentful of immigrants who are seen to be depriving the native population of jobs, a feeling which has been given credibility by the fact that many South African employers have employed migrants from other countries for lower pay than South African citizens, especially in the  construction ,  tourism ,  agriculture  and  domestic service  industries. Illegal immigrants are also heavily involved in informal trading. [ 36 ]  However, many immigrants to South Africa continue to live in poor conditions, and the South African immigration policy has become increasingly restrictive since 1994. [ 37 ]   Principal international trading partners of South Africa  besides other African countries  include  Germany ,  Japan ,  Switzerland , the  United Kingdom , and the  United States . Chief exports include  corn ,  diamonds ,  fruits ,  gold ,  metals  and  minerals ,  sugar , and  wool .  Machinery  and transportation equipment make up more than one-third of the value of the countrys imports. Other imports include  chemicals , manufactured goods, and  petroleum .     Electricity crisis   After unsuccessful attempts by the government to encourage private construction of electricity generation capacity, in 2007 the state-owned electricity supplier ( Eskom ) started experiencing a lack of capacity in the electrical generating and reticulation infrastructure. This led to an inability to meet the routine demands of industry and consumers, resulting in countrywide  rolling blackouts . Initially the lack of capacity was triggered by a failure at  Koeberg nuclear power station , but since then a general lack of capacity became evident. The supplier has been widely criticised for failing to adequately plan for and construct sufficient electrical generating capacity, [ 38 ]  although ultimately the government has admitted that it is at fault for refusing to approve funding for investment in infrastructure. [ 39 ]     Agriculture          Workers planting on a farm in the central area of  Mpumalanga .               Farm  workers.       South Africa has a large agricultural sector and is a net exporter of  farming  products. There are almost a thousand  agricultural cooperatives  and  agribusinesses  throughout the country, and agricultural exports have constituted 8% of South African total exports for the past five years. The agricultural industry contributes around 10% of formal employment, relatively low compared to other parts of Africa, as well as providing work for casual labourers and contributing around 2.6% of  GDP  for the nation. [ 40 ]  However, due to the  aridity  of the land, only 13.5% can be used for crop production, and only 3% is considered high potential land. [ 41 ]   Although the commercial farming sector is relatively well developed, people in some rural areas still survive on  subsistence agriculture . It is the eighth largest wine producer in the world, and the eleventh largest producer of sunflower seed. South Africa is a net exporter of agricultural products and foodstuffs, the largest number of exported items being  sugar ,  grapes ,  citrus ,  nectarines ,  wine  and  deciduous  fruit. The largest locally produced crop is  maize  (corn), and it has been estimated that 9 million tons are produced every year, with 7.4 million tons being consumed.  Livestock  are also popular on South African farms, with the country producing 85% of all meat consumed. The dairy industry consists of around 4,300 milk producers providing employment for 60,000 farm workers and contributing to the livelihoods of around 40,000 others. [ 42 ]   In recent years, the agricultural sector has introduced several reforms, some of which are controversial, such as  land reform  and the deregulation of the market for agricultural products. Land reform has been criticised both by farmers' groups and by landless workers, the latter alleging that the pace of change has not been fast enough, and the former alleging racist treatment and expressing concerns that a similar situation to  Zimbabwe's land reform policy  may develop, [ 43 ]  a fear exacerbated by comments made by  deputy president , the deputy president of South Africa. [ 44 ] [ 45 ]  The sector continues to face problems, with increased foreign competition and crime being two of the major challenges for the industry. The government has been accused of either putting in too much effort [ 46 ] , or not enough effort [ 47 ] , to tackle the problem of  farm attacks  as opposed to other forms of violent crime.   Another issue which affects South African agriculture is environmental damage caused by misuse of the land and global climate change. South Africa is unusually vulnerable to climate change and resultant diminution of surface waters. Some predictions show surface water supply could decrease by 60% by the year 2070 in parts of the Western Cape. [ 48 ]  To reverse the damage caused by land mismanagement, the government has supported a scheme which promotes  sustainable development  and the use of natural resources. [ 49 ]  Maize production, which contributes to a 36% majority of the gross value of South Africas field crops, has also experienced negative effects due to climate change. The estimated value of loss, which takes into consideration scenarios with and without the carbon dioxide fertilization effect [2]  ,ranges between 10s to 100s of millions of Rands.

South Africa is a nation of more than 48 million people of diverse origins,  cultures ,  languages , and  religions . The last  census  was held in 2001 and the next will be in 2011.  Statistics South Africa  provided five  racial  categories by which people could classify themselves, the last of which, ""unspecified/other"" drew negligible responses, and these results were omitted. [ 51 ]  The 2006 midyear estimated figures for the other categories were  Black African  at 79.5%,  White  at 9.2%,  Coloured  at 8.9%, and  Indian or Asian  at 2.5%. [ 52 ]  Even though the population of South Africa has increased in the past decade [ 51 ] [ 53 ]  (primarily due to immigration), the country had an annual population growth rate of 0.501% in 2008 (CIA est.), including immigration. [ 54 ]  South Africa is home to an estimated 5 million  illegal immigrants , including some 3 million  Zimbabweans . [ 55 ] [ 56 ] [ 57 ]  A series of  anti-immigrant riots  occurred in South Africa beginning on 11 May 2008. [ 58 ] [ 59 ]   By far the major part of the population classified itself as African or black, but it is not culturally or linguistically homogeneous. Major ethnic groups include the  Zulu ,  Xhosa ,  Basotho  (South Sotho),  Bapedi  (North Sotho),  Venda ,  Tswana ,  Tsonga ,  Swazi  and  Ndebele , all of which speak  Bantu languages  (see  Bantu peoples of South Africa ).   Some, such as the Zulu, Xhosa, Bapedi and Venda groups, are unique to South Africa. Other groups are distributed across the borders with neighbours of South Africa: The  Basotho  group is also the major ethnic group in  Lesotho . The  Tswana  ethnic group constitute the majority of the population of  Botswana . The  Swazi  ethnic group is the major ethnic group in  Swaziland . The  Ndebele  ethnic group is also found in  Matabeleland  in  Zimbabwe , where they are known as the  Matabele . These Ndebele people are the descendants of a Zulu faction under the warrior  Mzilikazi  that escaped persecution from  Shaka  by migrating to their current territory. The  Tsonga  ethnic group is also found in southern  Mozambique , where they are known as the Shangaan.   The white population is not ethnically homogenous and descend from many ethnic groups:  Dutch ,  Flemish ,  Portuguese , German, French  Huguenot , English, Irish, Italian, Scottish and  Welsh . Culturally and linguistically, they are divided into the  Afrikaners , who speak  Afrikaans , and English-speaking groups, many of whom are descended from British and Irish immigrants (see  Anglo-African ). Many small communities that have immigrated over the last century retain the use of other languages. The  white population  is on the decrease due to a low birth rate and emigration; as a factor in their decision to emigrate, many cite the high  crime  rate and the  affirmative action  policies of the government. Since 1994, approximately 1 000 000 white South Africans have permanently emigrated. [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ] [ 63 ]  Despite high emigration levels, a high level of non-South African white immigrants have settled in the country, in particular from countries such as  Britain  and  Zimbabwe . For example, by 2005, an estimated 212 000 British citizens were residing in South Africa. Since 2003, the numbers of British migrants coming to South Africa has risen by 50%. An estimated 20 000 British migrants moved to South Africa in 2007. There have also been a significant number of  white Zimbabwean  arrivals, fleeing their home country in light of the economic and political problems currently facing the country. As well as recent arrivals, a significant number of white Zimbabweans emigrated to South Africa in the wake of independence in Zimbabwe in 1980. Some of the more nostalgic members of the community are known in popular culture as "" Whenwes "", because of their nostalgia for their lives in  Rhodesia  ""when we were in Rhodesia"". [ 64 ]   The term  Coloured  is still largely used for the people of mixed race descended from slaves brought in from East and Central Africa, the indigenous  Khoisan  who lived in the  Cape  at the time, Bantus, Whites (mostly the  Dutch / Afrikaner  and British settlers) as well as an admixture of  Javanese ,  Malay , Indian,  Malagasy  and Asian blood (such as  Burmese ). The majority speak Afrikaans. Khoisan is a term used to describe two separate groups, physically similar: light-skinned and small in stature. The  Khoikhoi , who were called  Hottentots  by the Europeans, were pastoralists and were annihilated; the San, called  Bushmen  by the Europeans, were hunter-gatherers. Within the Coloured community, more recent immigrants will also be found: Coloureds from the former  Rhodesia  (now  Zimbabwe );  Namibia  and immigrants of mixed descent from India and  Burma  ( Anglo-Indians / Anglo-Burmese ) who were welcomed to the Cape when India and Burma received their Independence.   The major part of the South African  Asian  population is Indian in origin (see  Indian South Africans ); many of them descended from indentured workers brought in the nineteenth century to work on the  sugar   plantations  of the eastern coastal area then known as  Natal . There is also a significant group of  Chinese South Africans  (approximately 100,000 individuals) and  Vietnamese  South Africans (approximately 50,000 individuals). In 2008, the Pretoria High Court has ruled that Chinese South Africans who arrived before 1994 are to be reclassified as  Coloureds . As a result of this ruling, about 12,000 - 15,000  [ 65 ] ethnically Chinese citizens who arrived before 1994, numbering 3%-5% of the total Chinese population in the country, will be able to benefit from government  BEE  policies. [ 66 ]   South Africa hosts a sizeable refugee and asylum seeker population. According to the  World Refugee Survey 2008 , published by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, this population numbered approximately 144,700 in 2007. [ 67 ]  Groups of refugees and asylum seekers numbering over 10,000 included people from  Zimbabwe  (48,400), The  Democratic Republic of the Congo  (24,800), and  Somalia  (12,900). [ 67 ]  These populations mainly lived in Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban, Cape Town, and Port Elizabeth. [ 67 ]     Science and technology   Several important scientific and technological developments have originated in South Africa.  The first human to human heart transplant was performed by cardiac surgeon  Christiaan Barnard  at  Groote Schuur Hospital  in December 1967  .  Max Theiler  developed a vaccine against Yellow Fever,  Allan McLeod Cormack  pioneered x-ray  Computed tomography , and  Aaron Klug  developed crystallographic electron microscopy techniques. These advancements were all recognized with  Nobel Prizes .  Sydney Brenner  won most recently, in 2002, for his pioneering work in  molecular biology .   Mark Shuttleworth  founded an early Internet security company  Thawte , that was subsequently bought out by world-leader  VeriSign . Despite government efforts to encourage entrepreneurship in biotechnology, IT and other high technology fields, no other notable groundbreaking companies have been founded in South Africa. However, it is the expressed objective of the government to transition the economy to be more reliant on high technology, based on the realization that South African cannot compete with Far Eastern economies in manufacturing, nor can the republic rely on its mineral wealth in perpetuity.   South Africa has cultivated a burgeoning astronomy community. It hosts the  Southern African Large Telescope , the largest optical telescope in the southern hemisphere. South Africa is currently building the  Karoo Array Telescope  as a pathfinder for the $20 billion  Square Kilometer Array  project. South Africa is a finalist, with Australia, to be the host of the SKA.     Society and culture       Main article:  Culture of South Africa              Decorated houses,  Drakensberg Mountains              Traditional  South African cuisine .       It may be argued that there is no ""single"" culture in South Africa because of its ethnic diversity. Today, the diversity in foods from many cultures is enjoyed by all and especially marketed to tourists who wish to sample the large variety of South African cuisine. In addition to  food ,  music  and  dance  feature prominently.   South African cuisine  is heavily  meat-based  and has spawned the distinctively South African social gathering known as a  braai , or barbecue. South Africa has also developed into a major  wine  producer, with some of the best  vineyards  lying in valleys around  Stellenbosch ,  Franschoek ,  Paarl  and  Barrydale . [ 68 ]   There is great diversity in music from South Africa. Many black musicians who sang in Afrikaans or English during apartheid have since begun to sing in traditional African languages, and have developed a unique style called  Kwaito . Of note is  Brenda Fassie , who launched to fame with her song ""Weekend Special"", which was sung in English. More famous traditional musicians include  Ladysmith Black Mambazo , while the  Soweto String Quartet  performs classic music with an African flavour. White and Coloured South African singers are historically influenced by European musical styles including such western metal bands such as  Seether  (formerly Saron Gas). South Africa has produced world-famous jazz musicians, notably  Hugh Masekela ,  Jonas Gwangwa ,  Abdullah Ibrahim ,  Miriam Makeba ,  Jonathan Butler ,  Chris McGregor , and  Sathima Bea Benjamin .  Afrikaans  music covers multiple genres, such as the  contemporary   Steve Hofmeyr  and the  punk rock  band  Fokofpolisiekar . Crossover artists such as  Johnny Clegg  and his bands  Juluka  and  Savuka  have enjoyed various success underground, publicly, and abroad.   The South African black majority still has a substantial number of rural inhabitants who lead largely impoverished lives. It is among these people, however, that cultural traditions survive most strongly; as blacks have become increasingly  urbanised  and  westernised , aspects of traditional culture have declined. Urban blacks usually speak English or  Afrikaans  in addition to their native tongue. There are smaller but still significant groups of speakers of  Khoisan languages  who are not included in the eleven official languages, but are one of the eight other officially recognised languages. There are small groups of speakers of  endangered languages , most of which are from the Khoi-San family, that receive no official status; however, some groups within South Africa are attempting to promote their use and revival.   The  middle class  lifestyle, predominantly of the white minority but with growing numbers of Black, Coloured and Indian people, [ 69 ]  is similar in many respects to that of people found in  Western Europe , North America and  Australasia . Members of the middle class often study and work abroad for greater exposure to the markets of the world.   Asians , predominantly of Indian origin, preserve their own cultural heritage, languages and religious beliefs, being either  Christian ,  Hindu  or  Sunni Muslim  and speaking English, with Indian languages like  Hindi ,  Telugu ,  Tamil  or  Gujarati  being spoken less frequently, but the majority of Indians being able to understand their mother tongue. The first Indians arrived on the famous  Truro ship  as  indentured labourers  in Natal to work the Sugar Cane Fields. There is a much smaller  Chinese  community in South Africa, although its numbers have increased due to immigration from  Republic of China  (Taiwan).   South Africa has also had a large influence in the  Scouting  movement, with many Scouting traditions and ceremonies coming from the experiences of  Robert Baden-Powell  (the founder of Scouting) during his time in South Africa as a military officer in the 1890s. The  South African Scout Association  was one of the first youth organisations to open its doors to youth and adults of all races in South Africa. This happened on 2 July 1977 at a conference known as  Quo Vadis . [ 70 ]   The South African music scene consists of  Kwaito , a new music genre that had developed in the mid 80s and has since developed to become the most popular social economical form of representation among the populous. Though some may argue that the political aspects of Kwaito has since diminished after  Apartheid , and the relative interest in politics has become a minor aspect of daily life. Some argue that in a sense,  Kwaito  is in fact a political force that shows activism in its apolitical actions. Today, major corporations like  Sony ,  BMG , and  EMI  have appeared on the South African scene to produce and distribute  Kwaito  music. Due to its overwhelming popularity, as well as the general influence of DJs, who are among the top 5 most influential types of people within the country,  Kwaito  has taken over radio, television, and magazines. [ 71 ]   Kwaito , much like most hip-hop has its own local flavor and originality. However, unlike when hip-hop first burst on the scene as a politically driven and rebellious underground movement, South Africans wanted to create a happier vibe. As the post-apartheid fog cleared, South African youth found their ""own voice in a style of music known as kwaito, spawning a new (and profitable) industry"". [ 72 ]  According to TIMEeurope magazine, ""The kwaito sound now regularly incorporates traditional African music, jazz, gospel, and even rock guitar, most notably on Mandoza's 2000 hit Nkalakatha, one of the few kwaito records to cross over onto traditionally white radio"". [ 73 ]  In the kwaito, the samples from old school  Jamaican dancehall , European house, etc.,  tempos  are changed, beats are added, and urban street slang is also incorporated. This local flavor of music more recently has been attacked for its lack of ingenuity and its betrayal of its roots. The melodies and the incorporation of sex and dance have since become very similar to the American standard. In addition Kwaito has been criticised for its absence of influential lyrical content. As Kwaito is still a developing genre, and since the South African population is only around 48 million, sales of only 25,000 CDs are required for ""gold"" certification in South Africa. [ 72 ]     Religion       Main article:  Religion in South Africa               St. Mark 's Anglican Cathedral.       According to the latest 2001 national census, Christians accounted for 79.7% of the population. This includes  Zion Christian  11.1%,  Pentecostal  ( Charismatic ) 8.2%,  Roman Catholic  7.1%,  Methodist  6.8%,  Dutch Reformed  6.7%,  Anglican  3.8%, and other Christian 36%.  Islam  accounted for 1.5% of the population,  Hinduism  about 1.3%, and  Judaism  0.2%. 15.1% had no religious affiliation, 2.3% were other and 1.4% were unspecified. [ 74 ] [ 75 ]   African Indigenous Churches were the largest of the  Christian  groups. It was believed that many of these persons who claimed no affiliation with any organised religion adhered to  traditional indigenous religions . Many peoples have  syncretic  religious practices combining Christian and indigenous influences. [ 76 ]   Islam in South Africa  itself is not known to pre-date the colonial period, despite the isolated contact neighbouring  Mozambique  had with  Arab  and  East African  traders. [ citation needed ]  There is no evidence that Islam was known to the  Zulu ,  Swazi , or  Xhosa  of the east coast prior to the colonial era. Many South African Muslims are described as  Coloureds , notably in the  Western Cape , especially those whose ancestors came as slaves from the Indonesian archipelago (the  Cape Malays ). Others are described as  Indians , notably in  KwaZulu-Natal , including those whose ancestors came as traders from  South Asia ; they have been joined by others from other parts of Africa as well as white or black South African converts. It is estimated that  Islam  is the fastest growing religion of conversion in the country, [ 77 ]  with the number of black  Muslims  growing sixfold, from 12,000 in 1991 to 74,700 in 2004. [ 78 ]   Hinduism  dates back to British Colonial period primarily but later waves of continuous immigrants from India have contributed to a sizable Hindu population. Most Hindus are ethnically South Asian but there are many who come from mixed racial stock and many are converts with the efforts of Hindu missionaries such as ISKCON. Other religions in smaller numbers are  Sikhism ,  Jainism  and  Bah' Faith . [ 75 ]     Languages       Main article:  Languages of South Africa              Map showing principal South African languages by municipality. Lighter shades indicate a non-majority  plurality .             Afrikaans          Northern Sotho          Southern Sotho          Swati          Tsonga            Tswana          Venda          Xhosa          Zulu               South Africa has eleven  official languages : [ 79 ]   Sepedi ,  Sesotho ,  Setswana ,  siSwati ,  Tshivenda ,  Xitsonga ,  Afrikaans ,  English ,  isiNdebele ,  isiXhosa  and  isiZulu . In this regard it is  second only to India  in number. While each language is formally equal to every other, some languages are spoken more than others. According to the 2001 National Census, the three most spoken first home languages are Zulu (23.8%), Xhosa (17.6%) and Afrikaans (13.3%). [ 51 ]  Despite the fact that English is recognised as the language of commerce and science, it was spoken by only 8.2% of South Africans at home in 2001, an even lower percentage than in 1996 (8.6%). [ 51 ]   There are  eleven official names  for South Africa, one in each of the official national languages. The country also recognises eight non-official languages:  Fanagalo ,  Khoe ,  Lobedu ,  Nama ,  Northern Ndebele ,  Phuthi ,  San  and  South African Sign Language . [ citation needed ]  These non-official languages may be used in certain official uses in limited areas where it has been determined that these languages are prevalent. Nevertheless, their populations are not such that they require nationwide recognition.   Many of the ""unofficial languages"" of the  San  and  Khoikhoi  people contain regional  dialects  stretching northward into Namibia and Botswana, and elsewhere. These people, who are a physically distinct population from other Africans, have their own cultural identity based on their  hunter-gatherer  societies. They have been marginalised to a great extent, and many of their languages are in danger of becoming  extinct .   Many white South Africans also speak other European languages, such as  Portuguese  (also spoken by Angolan and Mozambican blacks), German, and  Greek , while some  Asians  and  Indians  in South Africa speak  South Asian  languages, such as  Tamil ,  Hindi ,  Gujarati ,  Urdu  and  Telugu .  French  is still widely spoken by French South Africans especially in places like  Franschhoek , where many South Africans are of French origin. South African French is spoken by less than 10,000 individuals. Congolese French is also spoken in South Africa by migrants.

Other sports with significant support are  swimming ,  golf  and  netball .  Basketball ,  surfing  and  skateboarding  are popular among the youth.   Famous boxing personalities include Baby Jake  Jacob Matlala ,  Vuyani Bungu ,  Welcome Ncita ,  Dingaan Thobela ,  Gerrie Coetzee  and  Brian Mitchell . Football players who have excelled in international clubs include  Lucas Radebe  of  Leeds United  and  Quinton Fortune , formerly of  Manchester United ,  Benni McCarthy  and  Aaron Mokoena  of  Blackburn Rovers  and  Steven Pienaar  of  Everton . South Africa produced  Formula 1  motor racing's 1979 world champion  Jody Scheckter .   South Africa hosted and won the  1995 Rugby World Cup  at their first attempt and again won the  2007 Rugby World Cup  in  France . South Africa was only allowed to participate from 1995 since the end of  Apartheid . It followed the 1995 Rugby World Cup by hosting and winning the  1996 African Cup of Nations  football tournament. It also hosted the  2003 Cricket World Cup  and the  2007 World Twenty20 Championship . South Africa will be the host nation for the  2010 FIFA World Cup , which will be the first time the tournament is held on the African continent.   In 2004, the swim team of  Roland Schoeman ,  Lyndon Ferns ,  Darian Townsend  and  Ryk Neethling  won the gold medal at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, simultaneously breaking the world record in the 4x100 freestyle relay.  Penny Heyns  won Olympic Gold in the 1996  Atlanta Olympic Games .   In golf,  Gary Player  is generally regarded as one of the greatest golfers of all time, having won the  Career Grand Slam , one of five golfers to have done so. Other South African golfers to have successfully won a major tournament include  Bobby Locke ,  Ernie Els ,  Retief Goosen  and  Trevor Immelman .     Current issues     HIV/AIDS       Main article:  HIV/AIDS in South Africa       The spread of  AIDS  (acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome) is an alarming problem in South Africa with up to 31% of pregnant women found to be HIV infected in 2005 and the infection rate among adults estimated at 20%. [ 80 ]  The link between HIV, a virus spread primarily by sexual contact, and AIDS was long denied by prior president  Thabo Mbeki  and then health minister  Manto Tshabalala-Msimang , who insisted that the many deaths in the country are due to malnutrition, and hence poverty, and not HIV. [ 81 ]  In 2007, in response to international pressure, the government made efforts to fight AIDS. [ 82 ]  In September 2008 Thabo Mbeki was ousted by the ANC and  Kgalema Motlanthe  was appointed for the interim. One of Mr. Motlanthe's first actions was to replace Mrs. Tshabalala-Msimang with the current minister,  Barbara Hogan .   AIDS affects mainly those who are sexually active and is far more prevalent in the black population. Most deaths are people who are also economically active, resulting in many families losing their primary wage earners. This has resulted in many 'AIDS orphans' who in many cases depend on the state for care and financial support. [ 83 ]  It is estimated that there are 1,200,000 orphans in South Africa. [ 83 ]  Many elderly people also lose the support from lost younger members of their family. Roughly 5 million people are infected with the disease. [ 82 ]     Crime       Main article:  Crime in South Africa               Prison  buildings on  Robben Island       According to a survey for the period 19982000 compiled by the  United Nations , South Africa was ranked second for  murder  and first for  assaults  and  rapes  per capita. [ 84 ]  Total crime per capita is 10th out of the 60 countries in the data set.   Crime  has had a pronounced effect on society: many middle-class South Africans moved into  gated communities , abandoning the central business districts of some cities for the relative security of suburbs. This effect is most pronounced in  Johannesburg , although the trend is noticeable in other cities as well. [ citation needed ]  Many emigrants from South Africa also state that crime was a big motivator for them to leave.  Crime against the farming community  has continued to be a major problem. [ 85 ]     Skills migration   Along with many African nations, South Africa has been experiencing a "" brain drain "" in the past 20 years. This is believed to be potentially damaging for the regional economy, [ 86 ]  and is almost certainly detrimental for the well-being of the majority of people reliant on the healthcare infrastructure, given the HIV/AIDS epidemic. [ 87 ]  The skills drain in South Africa tends to demonstrate racial contours (naturally given the skills distribution legacy of South Africa) and has thus resulted in large white South African communities abroad. [ 88 ]     Xenophobia       Main article:  Xenophobia in South Africa       In May 2008 long standing state hostility to African migrants exploded in a series of pogroms that left up to 100 people dead and 100,000 displaced.

The South African coast stretches 2,798 kilometres (1,739 mi) [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  and borders both the  Atlantic  and  Indian   oceans . [ 7 ]  To the north of South Africa lie  Namibia ,  Botswana  and  Zimbabwe , to the east are  Mozambique  and  Swaziland , while the  Kingdom of Lesotho  is an independent  enclave  surrounded by South African territory. [ 8 ]   Modern human beings have inhabited South Africa for more than 100,000 years. [ 9 ]  A century and a half after the discovery of the  Cape Sea Route , the  Dutch East India Company   founded  a refreshment station at what would become  Cape Town  in 1652. [ 10 ]  Cape Town became a British colony in 1806. European settlement expanded during the 1820s as the  Boers  (original  Dutch ,  Flemish ,  German  and  French  settlers) and the British  1820 Settlers  claimed land in the north and east of the country. Conflicts arose among the Xhosa, Zulu and Afrikaner groups. However, the discovery of diamonds and later gold triggered the conflict known as the  Anglo-Boer War  as the Boers and the British fought for the control of the South African mineral wealth. Although the Boers were defeated, limited independence was given to South Africa in 1910 as a British dominion. Anti-British policies focused on ultimate independence which was achieved in 1961 when South Africa was declared a  republic . The leading  National Party  legislated for a continuation of racial segregation begun under Dutch and British colonial rule, Boer republics, and subsequent South African governments (and which in 1948 became legally institutionalised  segregation  known as  apartheid ), despite opposition both in and outside of the country. In 1990 the then president  F.W. de Klerk  began to dismantle this legislation, and in 1994 the first democratic election was held in South Africa. This election brought  Nelson Mandela  and the current ruling party, the  African National Congress  to power, and the country rejoined the  Commonwealth of Nations .   South Africa is known for its diversity in cultures, languages, and religious beliefs, and eleven official languages are recognised in its  constitution . [ 7 ]  English is the most commonly spoken language in official and commercial public life, however it is only the fifth most spoken home language. [ 7 ]  South Africa is ethnically diverse, with the largest  Caucasian ,  Indian , and  racially mixed  communities in Africa. Although 79.6% of the South African population is  Black , [ 2 ]  this category is neither culturally nor linguistically homogeneous, as people within this classification speak a number of different  Bantu languages , nine of which have official status. [ 7 ]  Midyear 2007, the South African population was estimated at 47.9 million.

(September 2008)       Main article:  History of South Africa   South Africa contains some of the oldest archaeological sites in the world. [ 11 ]   [ 12 ]  Extensive fossil remains at the  Sterkfontein ,  Kromdraai  and Makapansgat caves suggest that various  australopithecines  existed in South Africa from about three million years ago. [ 13 ]  These were succeeded by various species of  Homo , including  Homo habilis ,  Homo erectus  and modern humans,  Homo sapiens . Settlements of  Bantu -speaking peoples, who were  iron -using agriculturists and herdsmen, were already present south of the  Limpopo River  by the fourth or fifth century (see  Bantu expansion ) displacing and absorbing the original  KhoiSan  speakers. They slowly moved south and the earliest ironworks in modern-day  KwaZulu-Natal Province  are believed to date from around 1050. The southernmost group was the  Xhosa  people, whose language incorporates certain linguistic traits from the earlier KhoiSan people, reaching the  Fish River , in today's  Eastern Cape Province . These  Iron Age  populations displaced earlier people, who often had  hunter-gatherer  societies, as they migrated.     European colonisation          Painting of an account of the arrival of  Jan van Riebeeck , the first  European  to settle in South Africa, with  Devil's Peak  in the background       In 1487, the  Portuguese  explorer  Bartolomeu Dias  became the first European to reach the southernmost point of Africa. Initially named The Cape of Storms, The King of Portugal,  John II , renamed it the  Cabo da Boa Esperana  or  Cape of Good Hope  as it led to the riches of India. This great feat of navigation was later immortalised in  Cames ' epic Portuguese poem,  The Lusiads  (1572). In 1652, a refreshment station was established at the  Cape of Good Hope  by  Jan van Riebeeck  on behalf of the  Dutch East India Company .  Slaves  were brought from  Indonesia ,  Madagascar , and India as a labour source for the Dutch immigrants in  Cape Town . As they expanded east, the Dutch settlers eventually met the south-westerly expanding  Xhosa  people in the region of the  Fish River . A series of wars, called the  Cape Frontier Wars , ensued, mainly caused by conflicting land and livestock interests.   Great Britain  took over the  Cape of Good Hope  area in 1795 ostensibly to stop it falling into the hands of the Revolutionary French, but also seeking to use  Cape Town  in particular as a stop on the route to Australia and India. It was later returned to the Dutch in 1803, but soon afterwards the  Dutch East India Company  declared bankruptcy, and the British annexed the Cape Colony in 1806. The British continued the frontier wars against the Xhosa, pushing the eastern frontier eastward through a line of forts established along the Fish River and consolidating it by encouraging  British settlement . Due to pressure of  abolitionist  societies in Britain, the  British parliament  first stopped its global  slave trade  with the passage of the  Slave Trade Act 1807 , then abolished slavery in all its colonies with the  Slavery Abolition Act 1833 . During the 1830s, approximately 12 000  Boers  (later known as  Voortrekkers ), departed from the  Cape Colony , where they were subjected to British control, to the future Natal, Orange Free State and Transvaal regions. The Boers founded the  Boer Republics  - the  South African Republic  (Now  Gauteng ,  Limpopo ,  Mpumalanga  and  North West  provinces) and the  Orange Free State  ( Free State ).   The discovery of  diamonds  in 1867 and  gold  in 1884 in the interior encouraged economic growth and immigration, intensifying the subjugation of the indigenous people. These important economic resources did not only play a role between European and the indigenous population but also between the Boers and the British. [ 14 ]   The  Boer Republics  successfully resisted British encroachments during the  First Boer War  (18801881) using  guerrilla warfare  tactics, much better suited to local conditions. However, the British returned in greater numbers, more experience, and more suitable tactics in the  Second Boer War  (18991902). The Boers' attempt to ally themselves with  German South-West Africa  provided the British with yet another excuse to take control of the Boer Republics. [ citation needed ]           Boers  in combat (1881).         Independence   After four years of negotiating, the  Union of South Africa  was created from the  Cape  and  Natal  colonies, as well as the republics of  Orange Free State  and  Transvaal , on 31 May 1910, exactly eight years after the end of the Second Boer War. The newly created Union of South Africa was a  dominion . The  Natives' Land Act  of 1913 severely restricted the ownership of land by 'blacks', at that stage to a mere 7% of the country, although this amount was eventually increased marginally. [ 15 ]  The union was effectively granted independence from the United Kingdom with the passage of the  Statute of Westminster , which morphed the  British king's  position within South Africa into that of the distinct  King of South Africa . In 1934, the  South African Party  and  National Party  merged to form the  United Party , seeking reconciliation between Afrikaners and English-speaking ""Whites"", but split in 1939 over the entry of the Union into  World War II  as an ally of the United Kingdom, a move which the National Party strongly opposed.   In 1948, the  National Party  was elected to power, and intensified the implementation of racial segregation that had begun under Dutch and British colonial rule, and subsequent South African governments since the Union was formed. The Nationalist Government systematised existing segregationist laws, and the system of segregation became known collectively as  apartheid . Not surprisingly, this segregation also applied to the wealth acquired during rapid industrialisation of the 1950s, '60s, and '70s. While the White minority enjoyed the highest  standard of living  in all of Africa, often comparable to  First World  western nations, the Black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard, including income, education, housing, and life expectancy. On 31 May 1961, following a whites-only  referendum , the country became a  republic  and left the (British)  Commonwealth . The office of  Governor-General  was abolished and replaced with the position of  State President .   Apartheid became increasingly controversial, leading to widespread  sanctions ,  divestment  and growing unrest and oppression within South Africa. (See also the article on the  History of South Africa in the apartheid era .) A long period of harsh suppression by the government, and at times violent resistance,  strikes , marches, protests, and  sabotage  by bombing and other means, by various anti-apartheid movements, most notably the  African National Congress  (ANC), followed. In the late 1970s, South Africa began a programme of  nuclear weapons  development and in the following decade it produced six deliverable nuclear weapons. The rationale for the nuclear arsenal is disputed, but it is believed [ who? ]  that  Vorster  and  P.W. Botha  wanted to be able to catalyse American intervention in the event of a war between South Africa and the  Cuban -supported  MPLA  government of  Angola .     Democracy   In 1990 the  National Party  government took the first step towards negotiating itself out of power when it lifted the ban on the  African National Congress  and other  left-wing  political organisations, and released  Nelson Mandela  from prison after twenty-seven years' incarceration on a  sabotage  sentence. Apartheid legislation was gradually removed from the statute books, and South Africa also destroyed its nuclear arsenal and acceded to the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . The first  multi-racial elections  were held in 1994, which the ANC won by an overwhelming majority. It has been in power ever since.   In  post-apartheid South Africa , millions of South Africans, mostly black, continued to live in  poverty , though poverty among whites, previously rare, has increased greatly. [ 16 ]  While some have partly attributed this to the legacy of the apartheid system, increasingly many attribute it to the failure of the current government to tackle social issues, coupled with the monetary and fiscal discipline of the current government to ensure both redistribution of wealth and economic growth. Since the ANC-led government took power, the  United Nations   Human Development Index  of South Africa has fallen, while it was steadily rising until the mid-1990s. [ 17 ]  Some of this could possibly be attributed to the  AIDS   pandemic  and the failure of the government to take steps to address it, [ 18 ] some of it can also be pinpointed to a government policy of  redistribution of wealth . As a mitigating factor, the social housing policy of the current government has produced an improvement in living conditions.     Politics   Main articles:  Politics of South Africa ,  Government of South Africa , and  Law of South Africa          The  Union Buildings  in  Pretoria  is the home of the South African executive.       South Africa has three capital cities:  Cape Town , the largest of the three, is the  legislative  capital;  Pretoria  is the  administrative  capital; and  Bloemfontein  is the  judicial  capital. South Africa has a  bicameral   parliament : the  National Council of Provinces  (the  upper house ) has 90 members, while the  National Assembly  (the  lower house ) has 400 members. Members of the lower house are elected on a population basis by  proportional representation : half of the members are elected from national lists and the other half are elected from provincial lists. Ten members are elected to represent each province in the National Council of Provinces, regardless of the population of the province. Elections for both chambers are held every five years. The government is formed in the lower house, and the leader of the majority party in the National Assembly is the  President .   The primary sources of South Africa law are Roman-Dutch mercantile law and personal law with English Common law, as imports of Dutch settlements and  British colonialism . [ 19 ]  The first European based law in South Africa was brought by the  Dutch East India Company  and is called  Roman-Dutch law . It was imported before the  codification  of European law into the  Napoleonic Code  and is comparable in many ways to  Scots law . This was followed in the 19th century by  English law , both  common  and  statutory . Starting in 1910 with unification, South Africa had its own  parliament  which passed laws specific for South Africa, building on those previously passed for the individual member colonies.   Current South African politics are dominated by the  African National Congress  (ANC), which received 69.7% of the vote during the last  2004 general election  and 66.3% of the vote in the  2006 municipal election . The current  President of South Africa  is  Kgalema Motlanthe , who replaced  Thabo Mbeki  on 25 September 2008. Mbeki succeeded former President  Nelson Mandela  in 1999, and was re-elected for a second five year term in 2004, but announced his resignation on 20 September 2008.   The main challenger to the rule of the ANC is the  Democratic Alliance  party, which received 12.4% of the vote in the 2004 election and 14.8% in the 2006 election.  Helen Zille , (elected 6 May 2007), is the party leader; the previous leader was  Tony Leon . The formerly dominant  New National Party , which introduced apartheid through its predecessor, the  National Party , chose to merge with the ANC on 9 April 2005. Other major political parties represented in Parliament are the  Inkatha Freedom Party , which mainly represents  Zulu  voters, and the  Independent Democrats , who took 6.97% and 1.7% of the vote respectively, in the 2004 election.   Since 2004, the country has had many thousands of popular protests, some violent, making it, according to one academic, the ""most protest-rich country in the world"". [ 20 ]  Many of these protests have been organised from the growing  shanty towns  that surround South African cities.     Foreign relations and military   Main articles:  South African National Defence Force ,  Foreign relations of South Africa , and  South Africa and weapons of mass destruction   Since the end of apartheid, the South African foreign policy has focused on its African partners particularly in the  Southern African Development Community  (SADC) and the  African Union . South Africa has played a key role as a mediator in African conflicts over the last decade, such as in  Burundi , the  Democratic Republic of Congo , the  Comoros , and  Zimbabwe . After apartheid ended, South Africa was readmitted to the  Commonwealth of Nations . As the  Union of South Africa , South Africa was a founding member of the  United Nations  and the then Prime Minister  Jan Smuts  wrote the preamble to its constitution. South Africa is currently a non-permanent member of the  United Nations Security Council  and has attracted controversy by voting against a resolution criticising the  Burmese  government in 2006 and against the implementation of sanctions against  Zimbabwe  in 2008. South Africa is a member of the  Group of 77  and chaired the organisation in 2006. South Africa is a member of the  South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone ,  Southern African Customs Union ,  World Trade Organization ,  International Monetary Fund ,  G20  and  G8+5 .   The South African  armed forces , known as the  South African National Defence Force  (SANDF), was created in 1994. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  Previously known as the  South African Defence Force  (SADF), the new force is an all volunteer army and consists of the forces of the old SADF, as well as the forces of the African nationalist groups, namely  Umkhonto we Sizwe  (MK),  Azanian People's Liberation Army  (APLA), and the former  Bantustan  defence forces. [ 21 ]  The SANDF is subdivided into four branches, the  South African Army , the  South African Air Force , the  South African Navy , and the  South African Military Health Services . [ 23 ]   In recent years, the SANDF has become a major  peacekeeping  force in Africa, [ 24 ]  and has been involved in operations in  Lesotho , the  Democratic Republic of the Congo , [ 24 ]  and  Burundi , [ 24 ]  amongst others. It has also participated as a part of multi-national  UN  peacekeeping forces.   South Africa undertook a nuclear weapons programme in the 1970s [ 25 ]  and  may have conducted  a nuclear test over the  Atlantic  in 1979. [ 26 ]  It is the only African country to have successfully  developed nuclear weapons . It has become the first country (followed by Ukraine) with nuclear capability to voluntarily renounce and dismantle its programme and in the process signed the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty  in 1991. [ 25 ]     Provinces, districts and municipalities   Main articles:  Provinces of South Africa ,  Districts of South Africa , and  Municipalities of South Africa          Map showing the provinces and districts (numbered) of South Africa.             Northern Cape          North West          Gauteng          Limpopo          Mpumalanga            KwaZulu-Natal          Eastern Cape          Free State          Western Cape               When apartheid ended in 1994, the South African government had to integrate the formerly independent and semi-independent  Bantustans  into the political structure of South Africa. To this end, it abolished the four former provinces of South Africa ( Cape Province ,  Natal ,  Orange Free State , and  Transvaal ) and replaced them with nine fully integrated provinces. The new provinces are usually much smaller than the former provinces, which theoretically gives local governments more resources to distribute over smaller areas.   The nine provinces are further subdivided into  52 districts :  6 metropolitan  and  46 district municipalities . The 46 district municipalities are further subdivided into  231 local municipalities . The district municipalities also contain 20 district management areas (mostly game parks) that are directly governed by the district municipalities.

At 470,979  sq mi  (1,219,912 km), [ 27 ]  South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world (after  Mali ). It is comparable in size to  Colombia .  Njesuthi  in the  Drakensberg  at 3,408 m (11,424 ft) is the highest peak in South Africa.          View of the  Drakensberg mountains , the highest mountain range in South Africa.       South Africa has a generally  temperate climate , due in part to it being surrounded by the  Atlantic  and  Indian Oceans  on three sides, by its location in the climatically milder  southern hemisphere  and due to the average elevation rising steadily towards the north (towards the  equator ) and further inland. Due to this varied topography and oceanic influence, a great variety of climatic zones exist.   The climatic zones vary, from the extreme  desert  of the southern  Namib  in the farthest northwest to the lush  subtropical  climate in the east along the  Mozambique  border and the  Indian  ocean. From the east, the land quickly rises over a  mountainous   escarpment  towards the interior  plateau  known as the  Highveld . Even though South Africa is classified as  semi-arid , there is considerable variation in  climate  as well as  topography .   The interior of South Africa is a vast, rather flat, and sparsely populated  scrubland ,  Karoo , which is drier towards the northwest along the Namib desert. In contrast, the eastern coastline is lush and well-watered, which produces a climate similar to the tropics. The extreme southwest has a climate remarkably similar to that of the  Mediterranean  with wet winters and hot, dry summers, hosting the famous  Fynbos   Biome . This area also produces much of the  wine  in South Africa. This region is also particularly known for its wind, which blows intermittently almost all year. The severity of this wind made passing around the  Cape of Good Hope  particularly treacherous for sailors, causing many  shipwrecks . Further east on the south coast, rainfall is distributed more evenly throughout the year, producing a green landscape. This area is popularly known as the  Garden Route .          Satellite picture of South Africa       The  Free State  is particularly flat due to the fact that it lies centrally on the high plateau. North of the  Vaal River , the Highveld becomes better watered and does not experience subtropical extremes of heat.  Johannesburg , in the centre of the Highveld, is at 1,740 metres (5,709 ft) and receives an annual rainfall of 760 millimetres (30  in ). Winters in this region are cold, although  snow  is rare.   To the north of Johannesburg, the altitude drops beyond the escarpment of the Highveld, and turns into the lower lying Bushveld, an area of mixed dry forest and an abundance of wildlife. East of the Highveld, beyond the eastern escarpment, the Lowveld stretches towards the  Indian  ocean. It has particularly high temperatures, and is also the location of extended subtropical agriculture.   The high  Drakensberg mountains , which form the south-eastern escarpment of the Highveld, offer limited  skiing  opportunities in winter. The coldest place in South Africa is  Sutherland  in the western  Roggeveld Mountains , where midwinter temperatures can reach as low as 15 degrees  Celsius  (5  F ). The deep interior has the hottest temperatures: A temperature of 51.7 C (125 F) was recorded in 1948 in the  Northern Cape  Kalahari near  Upington . [ 28 ]   South Africa also has one possession, the small sub-Antarctic archipelago of the  Prince Edward Islands , consisting of  Marion Island  (290 km/112 sq mi) and Prince Edward Island (45 km/17.3 sq mi) (not to be confused with the  Canadian province of the same name ).           Weather averages for Cape Town, South Africa         Month   Jan   Feb   Mar   Apr   May   Jun   Jul   Aug   Sep   Oct   Nov   Dec   Year       Average high C (F)   27  (81)   28  (82)   26  (79)   24  (75)   20  (68)   18  (64)   17  (63)   18  (64)   19  (66)   22  (72)   24  (75)   26  (79)   28  (82)       Average low C (F)   16  (61)   16  (61)   15  (59)   13  (55)   10  (50)   8  (46)   8  (46)   8  (46)   9  (48)   11  (52)   14  (57)   15  (59)   8  (46)       Precipitation  mm (inches)   16.5  (0.65)   13  (0.51)   20  (0.79)   54  (2.13)   92  (3.62)   111  (4.37)   96  (3.78)   87  (3.43)   56  (2.2)   40  (1.57)   24  (0.94)   18  (0.71)   627  (24.69)       Source: EuroWEATHER [ 29 ]  2008-02-22         Flora and fauna   See also:  Wildlife of South Africa   See also:  Protected areas of South Africa           Fynbos , a  floral kingdom  unique to South Africa, is found near  Cape Town               Swartberg  mountains near the town of  Oudtshoorn              A field of flowers in Weskus National Park.       South Africa is one of only 17 countries worldwide considered  megadiverse . It has more than 20,000 different  plants , or about 10% of all the known  species  of plants on  Earth , making it particularly rich in plant biodiversity. South Africa is the 6th most biodiverse country, [ 30 ]  after  Brazil ,  Colombia ,  Indonesia ,  China , and  Mexico . The most prevalent biome in South Africa is the  grassland , particularly on the  Highveld , where the plant cover is dominated by different  grasses , low  shrubs , and  acacia trees , mainly camel-thorn and whitethorn.  Vegetation  becomes even more sparse towards the northwest due to low  rainfall . There are several species of water-storing  succulents  like  aloes  and euphorbias in the very hot and dry  Namaqualand  area. The grass and thorn  savannah  turns slowly into a bush savannah towards the north-east of the country, with denser growth. There are significant numbers of  baobab  trees in this area, near the northern end of  Kruger National Park . [ 31 ]   The  Fynbos   Biome , which makes up the majority of the area and plant life in the  Cape floristic region , one of the six  floral kingdoms , is located in a small region of the  Western Cape  and contains more than 9,000 of those species, making it among the richest regions on earth in terms of floral biodiversity. The majority of the plants are  evergreen  hard-leaf plants with fine, needle-like  leaves , such as the  sclerophyllous  plants. Another uniquely South African plant is the  protea  genus of flowering plants. There are around 130 different species of protea in South Africa.   While South Africa has a great wealth of flowering plants, it has few  forests . Only 1% of South Africa is forest, almost exclusively in the  humid   coastal plain  along the  Indian Ocean  in  KwaZulu-Natal  (see  KwaZulu-Cape coastal forest mosaic ). There are even smaller reserves of forests that are out of the reach of  fire , known as montane forests (see  Knysna-Amatole montane forests ).  Plantations  of imported tree species are predominant, particularly the non-native  eucalyptus  and  pine . South Africa has lost a large area of natural habitat in the last four decades, primarily due to  overpopulation , sprawling development patterns and  deforestation  during the nineteenth century. South Africa is one of the worst affected countries in the world when it comes to invasion by alien species with many (e.g.  Black Wattle ,  Port Jackson ,  Hakea ,  Lantana  and  Jacaranda ) posing a significant threat to the native  biodiversity  and the already scarce water resources. The original  temperate forest  that met the first European settlers to South Africa was exploited ruthlessly until only small patches remained. Currently, South African  hardwood  trees like  Real Yellowwood   (Podocarpus latifolius) ,  stinkwood   (Ocotea bullata) , and South African  Black Ironwood   (Olea laurifolia)  are under government protection.   Numerous  mammals  are found in the  bushveld  habitats including  lions ,  leopards ,  white rhinos ,  blue wildebeest ,  kudus ,  impalas ,  hyenas ,  hippopotamus  and  giraffes . A significant extent of the bushveld habitat exists in the north-east including  Kruger National Park  and the  Mala Mala  Reserve, as well as in the far north in the  Waterberg Biosphere .   Climate change is expected to bring considerable warming and drying to much of this already semi-arid region, with greater frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, flooding and drought. According to computer generated climate modelling produced by the South African National Biodiversity Institute [ 32 ]  parts of southern Africa will see an increase in temperature by about one degree Celsius along the coast to more than four degrees Celsius in the already hot hinterland such as the  Northern Cape  in late spring and summertime by 2050.   The Cape Floral Kingdom has been identified as one of the global  biodiversity hotspots  since it will be hit very hard by  climate change  and has such a great diversity of life. Drought, increased intensity and frequency of fire and climbing temperatures are expected to push many of these  rare species  towards  extinction .   South Africa houses many endemic species, among them the  critically endangered   Riverine Rabbit  ( Bunolagus monticullaris ) in the  Karoo .     Economy   Main article:  Economy of South Africa          The  Victoria & Alfred Waterfront  in  Cape Town  with  Table Mountain  in the background. Cape Town has become an important  retail  and  tourism  centre for the country, and attracts the largest number of foreign visitors in South Africa       By  UN  classification South Africa is a middle-income country with an abundant supply of resources, well-developed financial, legal, communications, energy, and transport sectors, a  stock exchange  (the  JSE Limited ), that ranks among the top twenty in the world, and a modern infrastructure supporting an efficient distribution of goods to major urban centres throughout the entire region. South Africa is ranked 25th in the world in terms of  GDP  (PPP) as of 2007.   Advanced development is significantly localised around four areas: Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Durban, and Pretoria/Johannesburg. Beyond these four economic centres, development is marginal and poverty is still prevalent despite government efforts. Consequently the vast majority of South Africans are poor. However, key marginal areas have experienced rapid growth recently. Such areas include Mossel Bay to Plettenberg Bay; Rustenburg area; Nelspruit area; Bloemfontein; Cape West Coast; and the KwaZulu-Natal North Coast.   Even though South Africa has the seventh highest per capita income in Africa, only behind  Libya ,  Mauritius  it suffers from large income gaps and a  dual economy  marking it as a  developing country . South Africa has one of the highest rates of  income inequality  in the world. A decade of continual economic growth has helped to lower unemployment, but daunting economic and social problems remain. The average South African household income decreased considerably between 1995 and 2000. As for racial inequality,  Statistics South Africa  reported that in 1995 the average white household earned four times as much as the average black household. In 2000 the average white household was earning six times more than the average black household. [ 33 ]  The  affirmative action  policies have seen a rise in black economic wealth and an emerging black middle class. [ 34 ]  Other problems are crime, corruption, and  HIV / AIDS .   At the start of 2000, then President Thabo Mbeki vowed to promote economic growth and foreign investment by relaxing restrictive labour laws, stepping up the pace of  privatisation , and cutting unneeded governmental spending. His policies face strong opposition from organised  labour . South Africa is also the largest energy producer and consumer on the continent. South Africa is a popular tourist destination, and a substantial amount of revenue comes from tourism. [ 35 ]  Among the main attractions are the diverse and picturesque culture, the game reserves and the highly regarded local wines.   The South African  rand  (ZAR), is the most actively traded emerging  market currency  in the world. It has joined an elite club of fifteen currencies, the  Continuous linked settlement  (CLS), where forex transactions are settled immediately, lowering the risks of transacting across  time zones . The rand was the best-performing currency against the  United States dollar  (USD) between 2002 and 2005, according to the  Bloomberg  Currency Scorecard.   The volatility of the  rand  has affected economic activity, falling sharply during 2001 and hitting a historic low of 13.85  ZAR  to the  USD , raising fears of inflation, and causing the Reserve Bank to increase  interest rates . The rand has since recovered, trading at 7.13 ZAR to the dollar as of January 2008. However, as exporters are put under considerable pressure from a stronger domestic currency, many call for government intervention to help soften the rand.   Refugees from poorer neighbouring countries include many immigrants from the DRC, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Malawi and others, representing a large portion of the informal sector. With high unemployment levels amongst poorer South Africans,  xenophobia  is prevalent and many people born in South Africa feel resentful of immigrants who are seen to be depriving the native population of jobs, a feeling which has been given credibility by the fact that many South African employers have employed migrants from other countries for lower pay than South African citizens, especially in the  construction ,  tourism ,  agriculture  and  domestic service  industries. Illegal immigrants are also heavily involved in informal trading. [ 36 ]  However, many immigrants to South Africa continue to live in poor conditions, and the South African immigration policy has become increasingly restrictive since 1994. [ 37 ]   Principal international trading partners of South Africa  besides other African countries  include  Germany , the  United States ,  China ,  Japan , the  United Kingdom  and  Spain .  [ 38 ]  Chief exports include  corn ,  diamonds ,  fruits ,  gold ,  metals  and  minerals ,  sugar , and  wool .  Machinery  and transportation equipment make up more than one-third of the value of the countrys imports. Other imports include  chemicals , manufactured goods, and  petroleum .     Electricity crisis   After unsuccessful attempts by the government to encourage private construction of electricity generation capacity, in 2007 the state-owned electricity supplier ( Eskom ) started experiencing a lack of capacity in the electrical generating and reticulation infrastructure. This led to an inability to meet the routine demands of industry and consumers, resulting in countrywide  rolling blackouts . Initially the lack of capacity was triggered by a failure at  Koeberg nuclear power station , but since then a general lack of capacity became evident. The supplier has been widely criticised for failing to adequately plan for and construct sufficient electrical generating capacity, [ 39 ]  although ultimately the government has admitted that it is at fault for refusing to approve funding for investment in infrastructure. [ 40 ]     Agriculture          Workers planting on a farm in the central area of  Mpumalanga .               Farm  workers.       South Africa has a large agricultural sector and is a net exporter of  farming  products. There are almost a thousand  agricultural cooperatives  and  agribusinesses  throughout the country, and agricultural exports have constituted 8% of South African total exports for the past five years. The agricultural industry contributes around 10% of formal employment, relatively low compared to other parts of Africa, as well as providing work for casual labourers and contributing around 2.6% of  GDP  for the nation. [ 41 ]  However, due to the  aridity  of the land, only 13.5% can be used for crop production, and only 3% is considered high potential land. [ 42 ]   Although the commercial farming sector is relatively well developed, people in some rural areas still survive on  subsistence agriculture . It is the eighth largest wine producer in the world, and the eleventh largest producer of sunflower seed. South Africa is a net exporter of agricultural products and foodstuffs, the largest number of exported items being  sugar ,  grapes ,  citrus ,  nectarines ,  wine  and  deciduous  fruit. The largest locally produced crop is  maize  (corn), and it has been estimated that 9 million tons are produced every year, with 7.4 million tons being consumed.  Livestock  are also popular on South African farms, with the country producing 85% of all meat consumed. The dairy industry consists of around 4,300 milk producers providing employment for 60,000 farm workers and contributing to the livelihoods of around 40,000 others. [ 43 ]   In recent years, the agricultural sector has introduced several reforms, some of which are controversial, such as  land reform  and the deregulation of the market for agricultural products. Land reform has been criticised both by farmers' groups and by landless workers, the latter alleging that the pace of change has not been fast enough, and the former alleging racist treatment and expressing concerns that a similar situation to  Zimbabwe's land reform policy  may develop, [ 44 ]  a fear exacerbated by comments made by  deputy president , the deputy president of South Africa. [ 45 ] [ 46 ]  The sector continues to face problems, with increased foreign competition and crime being two of the major challenges for the industry. The government has been accused of either putting in too much effort [ 47 ] , or not enough effort [ 48 ] , to tackle the problem of  farm attacks  as opposed to other forms of violent crime.   Another issue which affects South African agriculture is environmental damage caused by misuse of the land and global climate change. South Africa is unusually vulnerable to climate change and resultant diminution of surface waters. Some predictions show surface water supply could decrease by 60% by the year 2070 in parts of the Western Cape. [ 49 ]  To reverse the damage caused by land mismanagement, the government has supported a scheme which promotes  sustainable development  and the use of natural resources. [ 50 ]  Maize production, which contributes to a 36% majority of the gross value of South Africas field crops, has also experienced negative effects due to climate change. The estimated value of loss, which takes into consideration scenarios with and without the carbon dioxide fertilisation effect  [2]  ,ranges between 10s to 100s of millions of Rands.

South Africa is a nation of more than 48 million people of diverse origins,  cultures ,  languages , and  religions . The last  census  was held in 2001 and the next will be in 2011.  Statistics South Africa  provided five  racial  categories by which people could classify themselves, the last of which, ""unspecified/other"" drew negligible responses, and these results were omitted. [ 52 ]  The 2006 midyear estimated figures for the other categories were  Black African  at 79.5%,  White  at 9.2%,  Coloured  at 8.9%, and  Indian or Asian  at 2.5%. [ 53 ]  Even though the population of South Africa has increased in the past decade [ 52 ] [ 54 ]  (primarily due to immigration), the country had an annual population growth rate of 0.501% in 2008 (CIA est.), including immigration. [ 55 ]  South Africa is home to an estimated 5 million  illegal immigrants , including some 3 million  Zimbabweans . [ 56 ] [ 57 ] [ 58 ]  A series of  anti-immigrant riots  occurred in South Africa beginning on 11 May 2008. [ 59 ] [ 60 ]   By far the major part of the population classified itself as African or black, but it is not culturally or linguistically homogeneous. Major ethnic groups include the  Zulu ,  Xhosa ,  Basotho  (South Sotho),  Bapedi  (North Sotho),  Venda ,  Tswana ,  Tsonga ,  Swazi  and  Ndebele , all of which speak  Bantu languages  (see  Bantu peoples of South Africa ).   Some, such as the Zulu, Xhosa, Bapedi and Venda groups, are unique to South Africa. Other groups are distributed across the borders with neighbours of South Africa: The  Basotho  group is also the major ethnic group in  Lesotho . The  Tswana  ethnic group constitute the majority of the population of  Botswana . The  Swazi  ethnic group is the major ethnic group in  Swaziland . The  Ndebele  ethnic group is also found in  Matabeleland  in  Zimbabwe , where they are known as the  Matabele . These Ndebele people are the descendants of a Zulu faction under the warrior  Mzilikazi  that escaped persecution from  Shaka  by migrating to their current territory. The  Tsonga  ethnic group is also found in southern  Mozambique , where they are known as the Shangaan.   The white population is not ethnically homogeneous and descend from many ethnic groups:  Dutch ,  Flemish ,  Portuguese , German, French  Huguenot , English, Irish, Italian, Scottish and  Welsh . Culturally and linguistically, they are divided into the  Afrikaners , who speak  Afrikaans , and English-speaking groups, many of whom are descended from British and Irish immigrants (see  Anglo-African ). Many small communities that have immigrated over the last century retain the use of other languages. The  white population  is on the decrease due to a low birth rate and emigration; as a factor in their decision to emigrate, many cite the high  crime  rate and the  affirmative action  policies of the government. Since 1994, approximately 1 000 000 white South Africans have permanently emigrated. [ 61 ] [ 62 ] [ 63 ] [ 64 ]  Despite high emigration levels, a high level of non-South African white immigrants have settled in the country, in particular from countries such as  Britain  and  Zimbabwe . For example, by 2005, an estimated 212 000 British citizens were residing in South Africa. Since 2003, the numbers of British migrants coming to South Africa has risen by 50%. An estimated 20 000 British migrants moved to South Africa in 2007. There have also been a significant number of  white Zimbabwean  arrivals, fleeing their home country in light of the economic and political problems currently facing the country. As well as recent arrivals, a significant number of white Zimbabweans emigrated to South Africa in the wake of independence in Zimbabwe in 1980. Some of the more nostalgic members of the community are known in popular culture as "" Whenwes "", because of their nostalgia for their lives in  Rhodesia  ""when we were in Rhodesia"". [ 65 ]   The term  Coloured  is still largely used for the people of mixed race descended from slaves brought in from East and Central Africa, the indigenous  Khoisan  who lived in the  Cape  at the time, Bantus, Whites (mostly the  Dutch / Afrikaner  and British settlers) as well as an admixture of  Javanese ,  Malay , Indian,  Malagasy  and Asian blood (such as  Burmese ). The majority speak Afrikaans. Khoisan is a term used to describe two separate groups, physically similar: light-skinned and small in stature. The  Khoikhoi , who were called  Hottentots  by the Europeans, were pastoralists and were annihilated; the San, called  Bushmen  by the Europeans, were hunter-gatherers. Within the Coloured community, more recent immigrants will also be found: Coloureds from the former  Rhodesia  (now  Zimbabwe );  Namibia  and immigrants of mixed descent from India and  Burma  ( Anglo-Indians / Anglo-Burmese ) who were welcomed to the Cape when India and Burma received their Independence.   The major part of the South African  Asian  population is Indian in origin (see  Indian South Africans ); many of them descended from indentured workers brought in the nineteenth century to work on the  sugar   plantations  of the eastern coastal area then known as  Natal . There is also a significant group of  Chinese South Africans  (approximately 100,000 individuals) and  Vietnamese  South Africans (approximately 50,000 individuals). In 2008, the Pretoria High Court has ruled that Chinese South Africans who arrived before 1994 are to be reclassified as  Coloureds . As a result of this ruling, about 12,000 - 15,000  [ 66 ] ethnically Chinese citizens who arrived before 1994, numbering 3%-5% of the total Chinese population in the country, will be able to benefit from government  BEE  policies. [ 67 ]   South Africa hosts a sizeable refugee and asylum seeker population. According to the  World Refugee Survey 2008 , published by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, this population numbered approximately 144,700 in 2007. [ 68 ]  Groups of refugees and asylum seekers numbering over 10,000 included people from  Zimbabwe  (48,400), The  Democratic Republic of the Congo  (24,800), and  Somalia  (12,900). [ 68 ]  These populations mainly lived in Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban, Cape Town, and Port Elizabeth. [ 68 ]     Science and technology   Several important scientific and technological developments have originated in South Africa.  The first human to human heart transplant was performed by cardiac surgeon  Christiaan Barnard  at  Groote Schuur Hospital  in December 1967  .  Max Theiler  developed a vaccine against Yellow Fever,  Allan McLeod Cormack  pioneered x-ray  Computed tomography , and  Aaron Klug  developed crystallographic electron microscopy techniques. These advancements were all recognised with  Nobel Prizes .  Sydney Brenner  won most recently, in 2002, for his pioneering work in  molecular biology .   Mark Shuttleworth  founded an early Internet security company  Thawte , that was subsequently bought out by world-leader  VeriSign . Despite government efforts to encourage entrepreneurship in biotechnology, IT and other high technology fields, no other notable groundbreaking companies have been founded in South Africa. However, it is the expressed objective of the government to transition the economy to be more reliant on high technology, based on the realisation that South African cannot compete with Far Eastern economies in manufacturing, nor can the republic rely on its mineral wealth in perpetuity.   South Africa has cultivated a burgeoning astronomy community. It hosts the  Southern African Large Telescope , the largest optical telescope in the southern hemisphere. South Africa is currently building the  Karoo Array Telescope  as a pathfinder for the $20 billion  Square Kilometer Array  project. South Africa is a finalist, with Australia, to be the host of the SKA.     Society and culture   Main article:  Culture of South Africa          Decorated houses,  Drakensberg Mountains              Traditional  South African cuisine .       It may be argued that there is no ""single"" culture in South Africa because of its ethnic diversity. Today, the diversity in foods from many cultures is enjoyed by all and especially marketed to tourists who wish to sample the large variety of South African cuisine. In addition to  food ,  music  and  dance  feature prominently.   South African cuisine  is heavily  meat-based  and has spawned the distinctively South African social gathering known as a  braai , or barbecue. South Africa has also developed into a major  wine  producer, with some of the best  vineyards  lying in valleys around  Stellenbosch ,  Franschoek ,  Paarl  and  Barrydale . [ 69 ]   There is great diversity in music from South Africa. Many black musicians who sang in Afrikaans or English during apartheid have since begun to sing in traditional African languages, and have developed a unique style called  Kwaito . Of note is  Brenda Fassie , who launched to fame with her song ""Weekend Special"", which was sung in English. More famous traditional musicians include  Ladysmith Black Mambazo , while the  Soweto String Quartet  performs classic music with an African flavour. White and Coloured South African singers are historically influenced by European musical styles including such western metal bands such as  Seether  (formerly Saron Gas). South Africa has produced world-famous jazz musicians, notably  Hugh Masekela ,  Jonas Gwangwa ,  Abdullah Ibrahim ,  Miriam Makeba ,  Jonathan Butler ,  Chris McGregor , and  Sathima Bea Benjamin .  Afrikaans  music covers multiple genres, such as the  contemporary   Steve Hofmeyr  and the  punk rock  band  Fokofpolisiekar . Crossover artists such as  Johnny Clegg  and his bands  Juluka  and  Savuka  have enjoyed various success underground, publicly, and abroad.   The South African black majority still has a substantial number of rural inhabitants who lead largely impoverished lives. It is among these people, however, that cultural traditions survive most strongly; as blacks have become increasingly  urbanised  and  westernised , aspects of traditional culture have declined. Urban blacks usually speak English or  Afrikaans  in addition to their native tongue. There are smaller but still significant groups of speakers of  Khoisan languages  who are not included in the eleven official languages, but are one of the eight other officially recognised languages. There are small groups of speakers of  endangered languages , most of which are from the Khoi-San family, that receive no official status; however, some groups within South Africa are attempting to promote their use and revival.   The  middle class  lifestyle, predominantly of the white minority but with growing numbers of Black, Coloured and Indian people, [ 70 ]  is similar in many respects to that of people found in  Western Europe , North America and  Australasia . Members of the middle class often study and work abroad for greater exposure to the markets of the world.   Asians , predominantly of Indian origin, preserve their own cultural heritage, languages and religious beliefs, being either  Christian ,  Hindu  or  Sunni Muslim  and speaking English, with Indian languages like  Hindi ,  Telugu ,  Tamil  or  Gujarati  being spoken less frequently, but the majority of Indians being able to understand their mother tongue. The first Indians arrived on the famous  Truro ship  as  indentured labourers  in Natal to work the Sugar Cane Fields. There is a much smaller  Chinese  community in South Africa, although its numbers have increased due to immigration from  Republic of China  (Taiwan).   South Africa has also had a large influence in the  Scouting  movement, with many Scouting traditions and ceremonies coming from the experiences of  Robert Baden-Powell  (the founder of Scouting) during his time in South Africa as a military officer in the 1890s. The  South African Scout Association  was one of the first youth organisations to open its doors to youth and adults of all races in South Africa. This happened on 2 July 1977 at a conference known as  Quo Vadis . [ 71 ]   The South African music scene consists of  Kwaito , a new music genre that had developed in the mid 80s and has since developed to become the most popular social economical form of representation among the populous. Though some may argue that the political aspects of Kwaito has since diminished after  Apartheid , and the relative interest in politics has become a minor aspect of daily life. Some argue that in a sense,  Kwaito  is in fact a political force that shows activism in its apolitical actions. Today, major corporations like  Sony ,  BMG , and  EMI  have appeared on the South African scene to produce and distribute  Kwaito  music. Due to its overwhelming popularity, as well as the general influence of DJs, who are among the top 5 most influential types of people within the country,  Kwaito  has taken over radio, television, and magazines. [ 72 ]   Kwaito , much like most hip-hop has its own local flavor and originality. However, unlike when hip-hop first burst on the scene as a politically driven and rebellious underground movement, South Africans wanted to create a happier vibe. As the post-apartheid fog cleared, South African youth found their ""own voice in a style of music known as kwaito, spawning a new (and profitable) industry"". [ 73 ]  According to TIMEeurope magazine, ""The kwaito sound now regularly incorporates traditional African music, jazz, gospel, and even rock guitar, most notably on Mandoza's 2000 hit Nkalakatha, one of the few kwaito records to cross over onto traditionally white radio"". [ 74 ]  In the kwaito, the samples from old school  Jamaican dancehall , European house, etc.,  tempos  are changed, beats are added, and urban street slang is also incorporated. This local flavour of music more recently has been attacked for its lack of ingenuity and its betrayal of its roots. The melodies and the incorporation of sex and dance have since become very similar to the American standard. In addition Kwaito has been criticised for its absence of influential lyrical content. As Kwaito is still a developing genre, and since the South African population is only around 48 million, sales of only 25,000 CDs are required for ""gold"" certification in South Africa. [ 73 ]     Religion   Main article:  Religion in South Africa           St. Mark 's Anglican Cathedral.       According to the latest 2001 national census, Christians accounted for 79.7% of the population. This includes  Zion Christian  11.1%,  Pentecostal  ( Charismatic ) 8.2%,  Roman Catholic  7.1%,  Methodist  6.8%,  Dutch Reformed  6.7%,  Anglican  3.8%, and other Christian 36%.  Islam  accounted for 1.5% of the population,  Hinduism  about 1.3%, and  Judaism  0.2%. 15.1% had no religious affiliation, 2.3% were other and 1.4% were unspecified. [ 75 ] [ 76 ]   African Indigenous Churches were the largest of the  Christian  groups. It was believed that many of these persons who claimed no affiliation with any organised religion adhered to  traditional indigenous religions . Many peoples have  syncretic  religious practices combining Christian and indigenous influences. [ 77 ]   Islam in South Africa  itself is not known to pre-date the colonial period, despite the isolated contact neighbouring  Mozambique  had with  Arab  and  East African  traders. [ citation needed ]  There is no evidence that Islam was known to the  Zulu ,  Swazi , or  Xhosa  of the east coast prior to the colonial era. Many South African Muslims are described as  Coloureds , notably in the  Western Cape , especially those whose ancestors came as slaves from the Indonesian archipelago (the  Cape Malays ). Others are described as  Indians , notably in  KwaZulu-Natal , including those whose ancestors came as traders from  South Asia ; they have been joined by others from other parts of Africa as well as white or black South African converts. It is estimated that  Islam  is the fastest growing religion of conversion in the country, [ 78 ]  with the number of black  Muslims  growing sixfold, from 12,000 in 1991 to 74,700 in 2004. [ 79 ]   Hinduism  dates back to British Colonial period primarily but later waves of continuous immigrants from India have contributed to a sizeable Hindu population. Most Hindus are ethnically South Asian but there are many who come from mixed racial stock and many are converts with the efforts of Hindu missionaries such as ISKCON. Other religions in smaller numbers are  Sikhism ,  Jainism  and  Bah' Faith . [ 76 ]     Languages   Main article:  Languages of South Africa          Map showing principal South African languages by municipality. Lighter shades indicate a non-majority  plurality .             Afrikaans          Northern Sotho          Southern Sotho          Swati          Tsonga            Tswana          Venda          Xhosa          Zulu               South Africa has eleven  official languages : [ 80 ]   Sepedi ,  Sesotho ,  Setswana ,  siSwati ,  Tshivenda ,  Xitsonga ,  Afrikaans ,  English ,  isiNdebele ,  isiXhosa  and  isiZulu . In this regard it is  second only to India  in number. While each language is formally equal to every other, some languages are spoken more than others. According to the 2001 National Census, the three most spoken first home languages are Zulu (23.8%), Xhosa (17.6%) and Afrikaans (13.3%). [ 52 ]  Despite the fact that English is recognised as the language of commerce and science, it was spoken by only 8.2% of South Africans at home in 2001, an even lower percentage than in 1996 (8.6%). [ 52 ]   There are  eleven official names  for South Africa, one in each of the official national languages. The country also recognises eight non-official languages:  Fanagalo ,  Khoe ,  Lobedu ,  Nama ,  Northern Ndebele ,  Phuthi ,  San  and  South African Sign Language . [ citation needed ]  These non-official languages may be used in certain official uses in limited areas where it has been determined that these languages are prevalent. Nevertheless, their populations are not such that they require nationwide recognition.   Many of the ""unofficial languages"" of the  San  and  Khoikhoi  people contain regional  dialects  stretching northward into Namibia and Botswana, and elsewhere. These people, who are a physically distinct population from other Africans, have their own cultural identity based on their  hunter-gatherer  societies. They have been marginalised to a great extent, and many of their languages are in danger of becoming  extinct .   Many white South Africans also speak other European languages, such as  Portuguese  (also spoken by Angolan and Mozambican blacks), German, and  Greek , while some  Asians  and  Indians  in South Africa speak  South Asian  languages, such as  Tamil ,  Hindi ,  Gujarati ,  Urdu  and  Telugu .  French  is still widely spoken by French South Africans especially in places like  Franschhoek , where many South Africans are of French origin. South African French is spoken by less than 10,000 individuals. Congolese French is also spoken in South Africa by migrants.

Other sports with significant support are  swimming ,  golf  and  netball .  Basketball ,  surfing  and  skateboarding  are popular among the youth.   Famous boxing personalities include Baby Jake  Jacob Matlala ,  Vuyani Bungu ,  Welcome Ncita ,  Dingaan Thobela ,  Gerrie Coetzee  and  Brian Mitchell . Football players who have excelled in international clubs include  Lucas Radebe  of  Leeds United  and  Quinton Fortune , formerly of  Manchester United ,  Benni McCarthy  and  Aaron Mokoena  of  Blackburn Rovers  and  Steven Pienaar  of  Everton . South Africa produced  Formula 1  motor racing's 1979 world champion  Jody Scheckter .   South Africa hosted and won the  1995 Rugby World Cup  at their first attempt and again won the  2007 Rugby World Cup  in  France . South Africa was only allowed to participate from 1995 since the end of  Apartheid . It followed the 1995 Rugby World Cup by hosting and winning the  1996 African Cup of Nations  football tournament. It also hosted the  2003 Cricket World Cup  and the  2007 World Twenty20 Championship . South Africa will be the host nation for the  2010 FIFA World Cup , which will be the first time the tournament is held on the African continent.   In 2004, the swim team of  Roland Schoeman ,  Lyndon Ferns ,  Darian Townsend  and  Ryk Neethling  won the gold medal at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, simultaneously breaking the world record in the 4x100 freestyle relay.  Penny Heyns  won Olympic Gold in the 1996  Atlanta Olympic Games .   In golf,  Gary Player  is generally regarded as one of the greatest golfers of all time, having won the  Career Grand Slam , one of five golfers to have done so. Other South African golfers to have successfully won a major tournament include  Bobby Locke ,  Ernie Els ,  Retief Goosen  and  Trevor Immelman .     Current issues     HIV/AIDS   Main article:  HIV/AIDS in South Africa   The spread of  AIDS  (acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome) is an alarming problem in South Africa with up to 31% of pregnant women found to be HIV infected in 2005 and the infection rate among adults estimated at 20%. [ 81 ]  The link between HIV, a virus spread primarily by sexual contact, and AIDS was long denied by prior president  Thabo Mbeki  and then health minister  Manto Tshabalala-Msimang , who insisted that the many deaths in the country are due to malnutrition, and hence poverty, and not HIV. [ 82 ]  In 2007, in response to international pressure, the government made efforts to fight AIDS. [ 83 ]  In September 2008 Thabo Mbeki was ousted by the ANC and  Kgalema Motlanthe  was appointed for the interim. One of Mr. Motlanthe's first actions was to replace Mrs. Tshabalala-Msimang with the current minister,  Barbara Hogan .   AIDS affects mainly those who are sexually active and is far more prevalent in the black population. Most deaths are people who are also economically active, resulting in many families losing their primary wage earners. This has resulted in many 'AIDS orphans' who in many cases depend on the state for care and financial support. [ 84 ]  It is estimated that there are 1,200,000 orphans in South Africa. [ 84 ]  Many elderly people also lose the support from lost younger members of their family. Roughly 5 million people are infected with the disease. [ 83 ]     Crime   Main article:  Crime in South Africa           Prison  buildings on  Robben Island       According to a survey for the period 19982000 compiled by the  United Nations , South Africa was ranked second for  murder  and first for  assaults  and  rapes  per capita. [ 85 ]  Total crime per capita is 10th out of the 60 countries in the data set.   Crime  has had a pronounced effect on society: many middle-class South Africans moved into  gated communities , abandoning the central business districts of some cities for the relative security of suburbs. This effect is most pronounced in  Johannesburg , although the trend is noticeable in other cities as well. [ citation needed ]  Many emigrants from South Africa also state that crime was a big motivator for them to leave.  Crime against the farming community  has continued to be a major problem. [ 86 ]     Skills migration   Along with many African nations, South Africa has been experiencing a "" brain drain "" in the past 20 years. This is believed to be potentially damaging for the regional economy, [ 87 ]  and is almost certainly detrimental for the well-being of the majority of people reliant on the healthcare infrastructure, given the HIV/AIDS epidemic. [ 88 ]  The skills drain in South Africa tends to demonstrate racial contours (naturally given the skills distribution legacy of South Africa) and has thus resulted in large white South African communities abroad. [ 89 ]     Xenophobia   Main article:  Xenophobia in South Africa   In May 2008 long standing state hostility to African migrants exploded in a series of pogroms that left up to 100 people dead and 100,000 displaced.

Located at roughly 13 North of the  equator  and 59 West of the  prime meridian , it is considered a part of the  Lesser Antilles . Its closest island neighbours are  Saint Vincent & the Grenadines  and  Saint Lucia  to the west. To the south lies  Trinidad and Tobago with which Barbados now shares a fixed official maritime boundaryand also the  South American  mainland. Barbados's total land area is about 430 square kilometres (166 square miles), and is primarily low-lying, with some higher in the country's interior. The highest point in Barbados is  Mount Hillaby  in the parish of Saint Andrew. The geological composition of Barbados is of non-volcanic origin and is predominantly composed of  limestone - coral  formed by subduction of the South American plate colliding with the Caribbean plate. The island's climate is  tropical , with constant  trade winds  off the Atlantic Ocean serving to keep temperatures mild. Some less developed areas of the country contain tropical woodland and  mangroves . Other parts of the interior which contribute to the agriculture industry are dotted with large  sugarcane  estates and wide, gently sloping  pastures , with panoramic views down to the coast also.   Barbados's  human development index  ranking is consistently among the top 75 countries in the world. For example, in 2006, it was ranked 31st in the world, and third in the Americas, behind  Canada  and the  United States .

The origin of the name ""Barbados"" is controversial. The  Portuguese , en route to  Brazil  are credited as the first Europeans to discover and name the island. It is a matter of conjecture whether the word ""bearded"" refers to the long, hanging roots of the bearded fig-tree ( Ficus citrifolia ), indigenous to the island, to bearded  Caribs  inhabiting the island, or to the foam spraying over the outlying reefs giving the impression of a beard. In 1519, a map produced by the Genoese mapmaker  Visconte Maggiolo  showed and named Barbados in its correct position southeast of the island of  Dominica .   Another name associated with Barbados or her people is ""Bim"" or ""Bimshire"". The origin is uncertain but several theories abound, the  National Cultural Foundation  of Barbados follows the Dr.  Richard Allsopp  theory, which is that ""Bim"" was a word commonly used by slaves and that it derives from the phrase ""bi mu"" [ 3 ]  or either (""bem"", ""Ndi bem"", ""Nwanyi ibem"" or ""Nwoke ibem"") [ 4 ]  from an  Igbo  phrase, meaning ""my people."" In colloquial or literary contexts, ""Bim"" can also take a more deific tone, referring to the ""goddess"" Barbados. [ citation needed ]  The word Bim and Bimshire are recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary and the Chamber's Twentieth Century Dictionaries. Another possible source for ""Bim"" is reported to be in the Agricultural Reporter of 25 April 1868, The Rev. N Greenidge (father of one of the island's most famous scholars, Abel Hendy Jones Greenidge) suggested the listing of Bimshire as a county of England. Expressly named were ""Wiltshire, Hampshire, Berkshire, and Bimshire"". [ 5 ]  Lastly in the Daily Argosy (of Demerara i.e. Guyana) of 1652 it referred to Bim as a possible corruption of the word "" Byam "", who was a Royalist leader against the Parliamentarians. That source suggested the followers of Byam became known as Bims and became a word for all Barbadians. [ 6 ]     [ edit ]   Early history   The first indigenous people are thought to be  Amerindians  who arrived from  Venezuela  around approximately 350-400 B.C. The  Arawak  people were the second wave of migrants, arriving from South America around 800. In the thirteenth century, the Caribs arrived from South America in the third wave, displacing both the Arawak and the Salodoid-Barrancoid culture. For the next few centuries, the Caribs  like the Arawak and the Salodoid-Barrancoid  lived in isolation on the island.   The  Portuguese  then briefly claimed Barbados from the mid-1500s to the 1600s; and may have seized the indigenous  Caribs  on Barbados and used them as  slave labour . Other Caribs are believed to have fled the island to neighbouring islands. Apart from possibly displacing the Caribs, the Portuguese left little impact and by the 1610s, they left for South America, leaving the island uninhabited.     [ edit ]   British colonial rule   British sailors who landed on Barbados in 1625 arrived at the site of present-day  Holetown . From the arrival of the first British settlers in 16271628 until independence in 1966, Barbados was under uninterrupted British control. Nevertheless, Barbados always enjoyed a large measure of local autonomy. Its  House of Assembly  began meeting in 1639. Among the initial important British figures was Sir  William Courten .   With the increased implementation of slave codes, which created differential treatment between Africans and the white workers and planters, the island became increasingly unattractive to  poor whites . Black or slave codes were implemented in 1661, 1676, 1682, and 1688. In response to these codes, several slave rebellions were attempted or planned during this time, but none succeeded. However, an increasingly repressive legal system caused the gap between the treatment of typically white indentured servants and black slaves to widen. Imported slaves became much more attractive for the rich planters who would increasingly dominate the island not only economically but also politically. Some have speculated that, because the Africans could withstand tropical diseases and the climate much better than the white slave population, the white population decreased. This is inconsistent with the fact that many poor whites simply migrated to neighbouring islands and remained in tropical climates. Nevertheless, poor whites who had or acquired the means to emigrate often did so. Planters expanded their importation of African slaves to cultivate sugar cane. The Barbados turned from mainly English and Scots-Irish in the seventeenth century to overwhelmingly black by the end of the 18th century.   Barbados eventually had one of the world's biggest sugar industries after Jews from Brazil introduced the sugarcane to the island in the mid 1600s. This quickly replaced  tobacco  plantations on the islands which were previously the main export. As the  sugar  industry developed into its main commercial enterprise, Barbados was divided into large plantation estates that replaced the smallholdings of the early British settlers. Some of the displaced farmers moved to other British colonies in the Americas, most notably  North  and  South Carolina , and  British Guiana , as well as  Panama . To work the plantations, planters imported enslaved West Africans to Barbados and other Caribbean islands.   The British abolished the  slave trade  in 1807 but not the institution itself. In 1816, slaves arose in the largest major slave rebellion in the island's history. Twenty thousand slaves from over seventy plantations rebelled. They drove whites off the plantations, but widespread killings did not take place. This was later termed Bussa's Rebellion after the slave ranger Bussa, who with his assistants hated slavery, found the treatment of slaves on Barbados to be intolerable, and believed the political climate in the UK made the time ripe to peacefully negotiate with planters for freedom (Davis, p. 211; Northrup, p. 191). Bussa's Rebellion failed. One hundred and twenty slaves died in combat or were immediately executed; another 144 were brought to trial and executed; remaining rebels were shipped off the island (Davis, pp. 212-213).   Slavery was finally abolished in the British Empire eighteen years later in 1834. In Barbados and the rest of the British West Indian colonies, full emancipation from slavery was preceded by an apprenticeship period that lasted four years.          Statue of  Lord Nelson  in  National Heroes Square  which predates the more famous  Nelson's Column  by some 27 years.       In 1884, the Barbados Agricultural Society sent a letter to  Sir Francis Hincks  requesting his private and public views on whether the Dominion of Canada would favourably entertain having the then colony of Barbados admitted as a member of the Canadian Confederation. Asked of  Canada  were the terms of the Canadian side to initiate discussions, and whether or not the island of Barbados could depend on the full influence of Canada in getting the change agreed to by the  United Kingdom . Then in 1952 the  Barbados Advocate  newspaper polled several prominent Barbadian politicians, lawyers, businessmen, the Speaker of the  Barbados House of Assembly  and later as first President of the  Senate , Sir Theodore Branker , Q.C. and found them to be in favour of immediate federation of Barbados along with the rest of the British  Caribbean  with complete Dominion Status within five years from the date of inauguration of the  West Indies Federation  with Canada.   However, plantation owners and merchants of British descent still dominated local politics, owing to the high income qualification required for voting. More than 70% of the population, many of them disenfranchised women, were excluded from the democratic process. It was not until the 1930s that the descendants of emancipated slaves began a movement for political rights. One of the leaders of this movement,  Sir Grantley Adams , founded the  Barbados Labour Party  in 1938, then known as the Barbados Progressive League. While being a staunch supporter of the monarchy, Adams and his party also demanded more rights for the poor and for the people. Progress toward a more democratic government in Barbados was made in 1942, when the exclusive income qualification was lowered and women were given the right to vote. By 1949 governmental control was wrested from the planters and, in 1958, Adams became Premier of Barbados.   From 1958 to 1962, Barbados was one of the ten members of the  West Indies Federation , an organisation doomed by nationalistic attitudes and by the fact that its members, as British colonies, held limited legislative power. Adams served as its first and only ""Premier"", but his leadership failed in attempts to form similar unions, and his continued defence of the monarchy was used by his opponents as evidence that he was no longer in touch with the needs of his country.  Errol Walton Barrow , a fervent reformer, became the new people's advocate. Barrow had left the BLP and formed the  Democratic Labour Party  as a liberal alternative to Adams' conservative government. Barrow instituted many progressive social programmes, such as free education for all Barbadians, and the School Meals system. By 1961, Barrow had replaced Adams as Premier and the DLP controlled the government.   With the Federation dissolved, Barbados had reverted to its former status, that of a  self-governing colony . The island negotiated its own independence at a constitutional conference with the United Kingdom in June 1966. After years of peaceful and democratic progress, Barbados finally became an independent state on 30 November 1966, with Errol Barrow its first Prime Minister. Upon independence Barbados maintained historical linkages with Britain by establishing membership to the  Commonwealth of Nations  grouping, a year later Barbados' International linkages were expanded by obtaining membership to the  United Nations  and the  Organization of American States .     [ edit ]   Government and politics          Parliamentary building.           Main articles:  Politics of Barbados  and  Monarchy of Barbados       Barbados has been an independent country since 30 November 1966. It functions as a  constitutional monarchy  and  parliamentary democracy , modeled on the British  Westminster system , with  Elizabeth II ,  Queen of Barbados , as  head of state  represented locally by the  Governor-General ,  Clifford Husbands  and the  Prime Minister  as the  head of the government . Its  Parliament  comprises thirty seats. It has been proposed that Barbados become a  republic  with a  president  replacing the  Barbadian sovereign ; this issue is still being debated, as the island has been stable and governmentally autonomous for decades.   Barbados is a full and participating member of the  Caribbean Community  (CARICOM), the  Caribbean (CARICOM) Single Market and Economy  (CSME), the  Caribbean Court of Justice  (CCJ), which pertains only to Barbados and  Guyana  but is expected to replace the UK  Privy Council  for the entire English-speaking Caribbean eventually, and the  Association of Caribbean States  (ACS). [ 7 ]   Barbados has a two party system, the two dominant parties being the ruling  Democratic Labour Party  and the  Barbados Labour Party . The Barbados Labour Party (BLP) had been in government for fifteen years, since 1993 until the 2008 general election. Under this administration, the Former Prime Minister, The Right Honourable Owen S. Arthur also acted as the Regional Leader of the CSM (Caribbean Single Market). The Right Honorable David Thompson is the Prime Minister of Barbados. [ 8 ]   On 11 April 2006, the 5-Member  UNCLOS  Annex VII Arbitral Tribunal, presided over by H.E. Judge  Stephen M. Schwebel , rendered after two years of international judicial proceedings, the landmark Barbados/Trinidad and Tobago Award, which resolved the maritime boundary delimitation (in the East, Central and West sectors) to satisfaction of both Parties and committed Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago to resolve their fisheries dispute by means of concluding a new Fisheries Agreement.     [ edit ]   Geography and climate of Barbados       Main article:  Geography and climate of Barbados              Map of Barbados              Beach near  Bridgetown , Barbados.       Barbados is extremely small for a Caribbean island. Relatively flat, it rises gently to the central highland region, the highest point being  Mount Hillaby , in the Scotland District, at 340 meters (1,100 ft) above sea level. The island is located in the Atlantic Ocean, to the east of the other Caribbean islands. The  climate  is tropical, with a rainy season from June to October.   Barbados is often spared the worst effects of the region's tropical storms and  hurricanes  during the rainy season as its far eastern location in the Atlantic Ocean puts it just outside the principal hurricane strike zone, and a hurricane hits about every 26 years. The last significant hit from a hurricane to cause severe damage to Barbados was  Hurricane Janet  in 1955.   In the parish of  Saint Michael  lies Barbados' capital and main city,  Bridgetown . Locally Bridgetown is sometimes referred to as ""The City"", but the most common reference is simply ""Town"". Other towns scattered across the island include  Holetown , in the parish of  Saint James ;  Oistins , in the parish of  Christ Church , and Speightstown, in the parish of  Saint Peter .   It is geologically composed of coral (90 m/300 ft thick). The land falls in a series of ""terraces"" in the west and goes into an incline in the east. Most of Barbados is circled by coral reefs.   The climate is moderate tropical with two seasons: dry and wet. The dry season (DecemberMay) and wet season (JuneNovember) gives an annual rainfall of 40-90 inches (1,0002,300 mm).     [ edit ]   Parishes       Main article:  Parishes of Barbados              Map of the parishes of Barbados       Barbados is  divided  into eleven administrative  parishes :     Christ Church   Saint Andrew   Saint George   Saint James   Saint John   Saint Joseph   Saint Lucy   Saint Michael   Saint Peter   Saint Philip   Saint Thomas       [ edit ]   Economy       Main article:  Economy of Barbados       Historically, the economy of Barbados had been dependent on  sugarcane  cultivation and related activities, but in recent years it has diversified into the  manufacturing  and  tourism  sectors. Offshore finance and information services have become important foreign exchange earners, and there is a healthy light manufacturing sector. In recent years the Government has been seen as business-friendly and economically sound. Since the late 1990s the island has seen a construction boom, with the development and redevelopment of hotels, office complexes, and homes.   The government continues its efforts to reduce  unemployment , encourage direct foreign investment, and privatize remaining state-owned enterprises. Unemployment has been reduced from around 14 percent in the past to under 10 percent.          Circulating  coins  2006       The economy contracted in 2001 and 2002 due to slowdowns in tourism, consumer spending and the impact of the  September 11, 2001 attacks , but rebounded in 2003 and has shown growth since 2004. Traditional trading partners include Canada, the  Caribbean Community  (especially  Trinidad and Tobago ), the United Kingdom and the United States.   Business links and investment flows have become substantial: as of 2003 the island saw from Canada  CA$  25 billion in investment holdings, placing it as one of Canada's top five destinations for Canadian  Foreign Direct Investment  (FDI). Businessman  Eugene Melnyk  of  Toronto , Canada, is said to be Barbados' richest permanent resident.   It was thought by key Barbadian industry sources that the year 2006 would have been one of the busiest years for building construction ever in Barbados, as the building-boom on the island entered the final stages for several multi-million dollar projects. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Transport       Main article:  Transport in Barbados       Transport on the island is good, with 'route taxis', called ""ZR's"" (pronounced "" Zed -Rs"" not ""Zee-Rs""), travelling to most points on the island. These small buses can at times be crowded, as passengers are generally never turned down, regardless of the number. However, they will usually take the more scenic routes to destinations. They generally depart from the capital  Bridgetown  or from  Speightstown  in the northern part of the island.          A  Mini Moke  at  Speightstown  beach       The island of Barbados's lone airport is the  Sir Grantley Adams International Airport (GAIA)  ( IATA  identifier  BGI ). It receives daily flights by several major airlines from points around the globe, as well as several smaller regional commercial airlines and charters. The airport serves as the main air-transportation hub for the Eastern Caribbean. It is undergoing a US$100 million upgrade and expansion.   There are three bus systems running seven days a week (though less frequently on Sundays), and a ride on any of them costs $1.50 BBD. The smaller buses from the two privately-owned systems (""ZRs"" and ""minibuses"") can give change; the larger blue and yellow buses from the government-operated  Barbados Transport Board  system cannot. Most routes require a connection in Bridgetown. Some drivers within the competitive privately owned systems are reluctant to advise persons to use competing services, even if those would be more suitable.   Some hotels also provide visitors with shuttles to points of interest on the island from outside the hotel lobby. There are several locally-owned and -operated vehicle rental agencies in Barbados but there are no multi-national car-rental agencies such as Avis, Europcar or Hertz.   There is also a helicopter shuttle service, which offers air taxi services to a number of sites around the island, mainly on the West Coast tourist belt. Air and water traffic is regulated by the  Barbados Port Authority .     [ edit ]   Tourist information   The island is well developed, and there are internationally known hotels offering world-class accommodation. Time-shares are available, and many of the smaller local hotels and private villas which dot the island have space available if booked in advance. The southern and western coasts of Barbados are popular, with the calm light blue Atlantic Ocean and their fine white and pinkish sandy beaches. Along the island's east coast the Atlantic Ocean side are tumbling waves which are perfect for light  surfing , but a little bit risky due to under-tow currents.   Shopping  districts are popular in Barbados, with ample duty-free shopping. There is also a festive night-life in mainly tourist areas such as the  Saint Lawrence Gap . Other attractions include wildlife reserves, jewellery stores,  scuba diving , helicopter rides,  golf ,  festivals  (the largest being the annual crop over festival July/Aug), sightseeing, cave exploration, exotic  drinks  and fine  clothes   shopping .     [ edit ]   Attractions, landmarks and points of interest   Tourism accounts for almost one half of the economy.

Close to 90% of all Barbadians (also known colloquially as  Bajan ) are of  African  descent (""Afro-Bajans""). A mix of many African ethnicities, notably the  Igbo ,  Akan  and  Yoruba people , they are mostly descendants of the  slave  labourers on the sugar plantations. The remainder of the population includes groups of Europeans (""Anglo-Bajans"" / ""Euro-Bajans"") mainly from the  United Kingdom , the  Republic of Ireland , Chinese locally known as Bajan-Chiney, Bajan Hindus from  India  and Muslims from  Bangladesh  and  Pakistan , and an influential ""Arab-Bajans"" group mainly of Christian  Syrians  and  Lebanese  descent. On the island are many people of  Creole  descent, a mixture of Afro-Caribbean and European descent (Primarily British, Irish and  Portuguese ).   Other groups in Barbados include people from the  United Kingdom ,  United States  and  Canada . Barbadians who return after years of residence in the U.S. are called ""Bajan Yankees""; this term is considered derogatory by some.   The country's official language is English, the local dialect of which is referred to as  Bajan , spoken by most. In religion, most Barbadians are  Christians  (67%), chiefly of the  Anglican Church , but there are Protestant,  Roman Catholic ,  Jehovah's Witness ,  Hindu ,  Muslim  and  Jewish  minorities. Barbados is a chief destination for emigrants from the South American nation of  Guyana . The biggest communities outside the Afro-Caribbean community are:     The  Indo-Guyanese , an important part of the economy due to the increase of immigrants from partner country  Guyana . There are reports of a growing Indo-Bajan diaspora originating from Guyana and  India . They introduced soca-chutney ,  roti  and many Indian dishes to Barbados' culture. Mostly from southern India and Hindu states, these 'Desi' peoples are growing in size but smaller than the equivalent communities in Trinidad & Guyana; Hinduism is one of Barbados' growing religions.   Euro-Bajans (4% of the population) [ 10 ]  have settled in Barbados since the 1500s, originating from  England , Portugal, Ireland and  Scotland . In 1643, there were 37,200 whites in Barbados (86% of the population). [ 11 ]  More commonly they are known as "" White Bajans "", although some carry Afro-Caribbean traces and vice-versa. Euro-Bajans introduced folk music, such as  Irish music  and Highland music, and certain place names, such as ""Scotland"", a mountainous region, and ""Trafalgar Square"" in Bridgetown, now renamed ""Heroes Square"". Among White Barbadians there exists an underclass known as  Redlegs ; the descendants of  indentured servants , and prisoners imported to the island. [ 12 ]   Chinese -Barbadians (or, as they are known on the island, ""Bajan-Chineys"") are a small portion of Barbados' Asian demographics, smaller than the equivalent communities of  Jamaica  and  Trinidad . Most if not all first arrived in the 1940s during the Second World War, originating mainly from the then British territory of  Hong Kong . Many Chinese-Bajans have the surnames Chin, Chynn or Lee, although other surnames prevail in certain areas of the island. Chinese food and culture is becoming part of everyday Bajan culture.   Lebanese and Syrians form the Middle Eastern community on the island and make up 89% of the Muslim population. Middle-Eastern Barbadians are often perceived to be the most successful group in business, along with the Chinese Bajans. During the  Arab Israeli Wars , many Syrians and Lebanese headed for the West Indies to escape conflict and poverty in the  Middle East . [ citation needed ]  Also Jewish people arrived in Barbados around the same time, creating the biggest synagogue in the West Indies.   Latin Americans have been migrating to the island since the 18th century, due to the close proximity of  South America , many  Venezuelans  had migrated to Barbados as labourers via Trinidad.  Brazilian Jews ,  Colombians  and  Panamanians  also live on the island. The Spanish language is now being encouraged to be taught as a second language in Barbadian schools over French.       [ edit ]   Culture          Banks beer at dusk           Main article:  Culture of Barbados     See also:  Music of Barbados     The influence of the English on Barbados is more noticeable than on other islands in the West Indies. A good example of this is the island's national sport:  cricket . Barbados has brought forth several great cricketers, including  Garfield Sobers  and  Frank Worrell .   Citizens are officially called Barbadians; Barbados' residents, however, colloquially refer to themselves or the products of the country as ""Bajan"". The term ""Bajan"" may have come from a localized pronunciation of the word Barbadian which at times can sound more like ""Bar-bajan"".   The largest  carnival -like cultural event which takes place on the island is the  Crop Over  festival. As in many other Caribbean and Latin American countries,  Crop Over  is an important event for many people on the island, as well as the thousands of tourists that flock to the island to participate in the annual events. The festival includes musical competitions and other traditional activities. It gets under way from the beginning of July, and ends with the costumed parade on Kadooment Day, held on the first Monday of August.   Barbados retains a strong British influence and is referred to by its neighbours as ""Little England"".     [ edit ]   Sports in Barbados     See also:  Cricket in the West Indies     As in other Caribbean countries of British descent,  cricket  is a favourite sport. In addition to several warm-up matches and six ""Super Eight"" matches, Barbados hosted the final of the  2007 Cricket World Cup .   In  golf , the  Barbados Open  is an annual stop on the  European Seniors Tour . In December 2006 the  WGC-World Cup  took place at the country's  Sandy Lane  resort on the Country Club course, an eighteen-hole course designed by  Tom Fazio .   Motorsports also play a role, with Rally Barbados occurring each summer and currently being listed on the FIA NACAM calendar.   Basketball  is a popular sport played at school or college and is increasing in popularity as is  volleyball , though volleyball is mainly played inside. At certain beaches such as Brandons beach in St. Michael people do get together to play  beach volleyball .   Other sports played include  hockey ,  table tennis ,  road tennis ,  football ,  rugby ,  polo  and  swimming .   Netball  is also popular with women in Barbados.     [ edit ]   National symbols     [ edit ]   Flower          A yellow and red Pride of Barbados ( Caesalpinia pulcherrima ).       The national flower is the Pride of Barbados or  Caesalpinia pulcherrima  (L.) Sw., which grows across the island.     [ edit ]   Flag   The tridented centered within the flag is a representation of the mythological  Neptune , god of the sea. The trident in its original unbroken form was taken from the former colonial seal, which itself was replaced by the current coat of arms. Used within the national flag, the left and right shafts of the trident were then designed as 'broken' representing the nation of Barbados breaking away from its historical and constitutional ties as a former colony.   The three points of the  trident  represent in Barbados the three principles of  democracy  - ""government of, for and by the people."" The broken trident is set in a centered vertical band of gold representing the sands of Barbados' beaches. The gold band itself is surrounded on both sides by vertical bands of ultramarine (blue) representing the sea and sky of Barbados.   The design for the flag was created by Grantley W. Prescod and was chosen from an open competition arranged by the Barbados government. Over a thousand entries were received. [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   Golden Shield   The Golden Shield in the coat of arms carries two "" Pride of Barbados "" flowers and the ""bearded"" fig tree ( Ficus citrifolia  or  Ficus barbata ), which was common on the island at the time of its settlement by the British and may have contributed to Barbados being so named.     [ edit ]   Coat of arms   The  coat of arms  depicts two animals which are supporting the shield. On the left is a "" dolphin fish "", symbolic of the fishing industry and seagoing past of Barbados. On the right is a  pelican , symbolic of a small island named  Pelican Island  that once existed off the coast of Bridgetown. Above the shield is the helmet of Barbados with an extended arm clutching two  sugar-cane  stalks. The ""cross"" formation made by the cane stalks represents the saltire cross upon which  Saint Andrew  was crucified. On the base of the Coat of Arms reads ""Pride and Industry"" in reference to the country's motto.     [ edit ]   National heroes       Main article:  Barbadian national heroes       On April 1998, the Order of National Heroes Act was passed by the  Parliament of Barbados . According to the government, the act established that 28 April (the centenary of the birth of Sir Grantley Adams) would be celebrated as  National Heroes' Day . The act also declared that there are ten national heroes of Barbados. All of which would be elevated to the title of the The Right Excellent. [ 14 ]   The ten official National Heroes of Barbados are:-     Bussa  ( - 1816)   Sarah Ann Gill  (1795 - 1866)   Samuel Jackman Prescod  (1806 - 1871)   Dr. Charles Duncan ONeal  (1879 - 1936)   Clement Osbourne Payne  (1904 - 1941)   Sir Grantley Herbert Adams  (1898 - 1987)   Rt.

Located at roughly 13 North of the  equator  and 59 West of the  prime meridian , it is considered a part of the  Lesser Antilles . Its closest island neighbours are  Saint Vincent & the Grenadines  and  Saint Lucia  to the west. To the south lies  Trinidad and Tobago with which Barbados now shares a fixed official maritime boundaryand also the  South American  mainland. Barbados's total land area is about 430 square kilometres (166 square miles), and is primarily low-lying, with some higher regions in the country's interior. The highest point in Barbados is  Mount Hillaby  in the parish of Saint Andrew. The geological composition of Barbados is of non-volcanic origin and is predominantly composed of  limestone - coral  formed by subduction of the South American plate colliding with the Caribbean plate. The island's climate is  tropical , with constant  trade winds  off the Atlantic Ocean serving to keep temperatures mild. Some less developed areas of the country contain tropical woodland and  mangroves . Other parts of the interior which contribute to the agriculture industry are dotted with large  sugarcane  estates and wide, gently sloping  pastures , with panoramic views down to the coast also.   Barbados's  human development index  ranking is consistently among the top 75 countries in the world. For example, in 2006, it was ranked 31st in the world, and third in the Americas, behind  Canada  and the  United States .

The origin of the name ""Barbados"" is controversial. The  Portuguese , en route to  Brazil  are credited as the first Europeans to discover and name the island. It is a matter of conjecture whether the word ""bearded"" refers to the long, hanging roots of the bearded fig-tree ( Ficus citrifolia ), indigenous to the island, to bearded  Caribs  inhabiting the island, or to the foam spraying over the outlying reefs giving the impression of a beard. In 1519, a map produced by the Genoese mapmaker Vesconte de Maggiola showed and named Barbados in its correct position southeast of the island of  Dominica .   Another name associated with Barbados or her people is ""Bim"" or ""Bimshire"". The origin is uncertain but several theories abound, the  National Cultural Foundation  of Barbados follows the Dr.  Richard Allsopp  theory, which is that ""Bim"" was a word commonly used by slaves and that it derives from the phrase ""bi mu"" [ 3 ]  or either (""bem"", ""Ndi bem"", ""Nwanyi ibem"" or ""Nwoke ibem"") [ 4 ]  from an  Igbo  phrase, meaning ""my people."" In colloquial or literary contexts, ""Bim"" can also take a more deific tone, referring to the ""goddess"" Barbados. [ citation needed ]  The word Bim and Bimshire are recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary and the Chamber's Twentieth Century Dictionaries. Another possible source for ""Bim"" is reported to be in the Agricultural Reporter of 25 April 1868, The Rev. N Greenidge (father of one of the island's most famous scholars, Abel Hendy Jones Greenidge) suggested the listing of Bimshire as a county of England. Expressly named were ""Wiltshire, Hampshire, Berkshire, and Bimshire"". [ 5 ]  Lastly in the Daily Argosy (of Demerara i.e. Guyana) of 1652 it referred to Bim as a possible corruption of the word "" Byam "", who was a Royalist leader against the Parliamentarians. That source suggested the followers of Byam became known as Bims and became a word for all Barbadians. [ 6 ]     [ edit ]   Early history   The first indigenous people are thought to be  Amerindians  who arrived from  Venezuela  around approximately 350-400 B.C. The  Arawak  people were the second wave of migrants, arriving from South America around 800. In the thirteenth century, the Caribs arrived from South America in the third wave, displacing both the Arawak and the Salodoid-Barrancoid culture. For the next few centuries, the Caribs  like the Arawak and the Salodoid-Barrancoid  lived in isolation on the island.   The  Portuguese  then briefly claimed Barbados from the mid-1500s to the 1600s; and may have seized the indigenous  Caribs  on Barbados and used them as  slave labour . Other Caribs are believed to have fled the island to neighbouring islands. Apart from possibly displacing the Caribs, the Portuguese left little impact and by the 1610s, they left for South America, leaving the island uninhabited.     [ edit ]   British colonial rule   British sailors who landed on Barbados in 1625 arrived at the site of present-day  Holetown . At the time it was inhabited only by natives who descended from those left behind by the Portuguese. From the arrival of the first British settlers in 16271628 until independence in 1966, Barbados was under uninterrupted British control. Nevertheless, Barbados always enjoyed a large measure of local autonomy. Its  House of Assembly  began meeting in 1639. Among the initial important British figures was Sir  William Courten .   With the increased implementation of slave codes, which created differential treatment between Africans and the white workers and planters, the island became increasingly unattractive to poor whites. Black or slave codes were implemented in 1661, 1676, 1682, and 1688. In response to these codes, several slave rebellions were attempted or planned during this time, but none succeeded. However, an increasingly repressive legal system caused the gap between the treatment of typically white indentured servants and black slaves to widen. Imported slaves became much more attractive for the rich planters who would increasingly dominate the island not only economically but also politically. Some have speculated that, because the Africans could withstand tropical diseases and the climate much better than the white slave population, the white population decreased. This is inconsistent with the fact that many poor whites simply migrated to neighbouring islands and remained in tropical climates. Nevertheless, poor whites who had or acquired the means to emigrate often did so. Planters expanded their importation of African slaves to cultivate sugar cane. The Barbados turned from mainly English and Scots-Irish in the seventeenth century to overwhelmingly black by the end of the 18th century.   Barbados eventually had one of the world's biggest sugar industries after Jews from Brazil introduced the sugarcane to the island in the mid 1600s. This quickly replaced  tobacco  plantations on the islands which were previously the main export. As the  sugar  industry developed into its main commercial enterprise, Barbados was divided into large plantation estates that replaced the smallholdings of the early British settlers. Some of the displaced farmers moved to other British colonies in the Americas, most notably  North  and  South Carolina , and  British Guiana , as well as  Panama . To work the plantations, planters imported enslaved West Africans to Barbados and other Caribbean islands.   The British abolished the  slave trade  in 1807 but not the institution itself. In 1816, slaves arose in the largest major slave rebellion in the island's history. Twenty thousand slaves from over seventy plantations rebelled. They drove whites off the plantations, but widespread killings did not take place. This was later termed Bussa's Rebellion after the slave ranger Bussa, who with his assistants hated slavery, found the treatment of slaves on Barbados to be intolerable, and believed the political climate in the UK made the time ripe to peacefully negotiate with planters for freedom (Davis, p. 211; Northrup, p. 191). Bussa's Rebellion failed. One hundred and twenty slaves died in combat or were immediately executed; another 144 were brought to trial and executed; remaining rebels were shipped off the island (Davis, pp. 212-213).   Slavery was finally abolished in the British Empire eighteen years later in 1834. In Barbados and the rest of the British West Indian colonies, full emancipation from slavery was preceded by an apprenticeship period that lasted four years.          Statue of  Lord Nelson  in  National Heroes Square  which predates the more famous  Nelson's Column  by some 27 years.       In 1884, the Barbados Agricultural Society sent a letter to  Sir Francis Hincks  requesting his private and public views on whether the Dominion of Canada would favourably entertain having the then colony of Barbados admitted as a member of the Canadian Confederation. Asked of  Canada  were the terms of the Canadian side to initiate discussions, and whether or not the island of Barbados could depend on the full influence of Canada in getting the change agreed to by the  United Kingdom . Then in 1952 the  Barbados Advocate  newspaper polled several prominent Barbadian politicians, lawyers, businessmen, the Speaker of the  Barbados House of Assembly  and later as first President of the  Senate , Sir Theodore Branker , Q.C. and found them to be in favour of immediate federation of Barbados along with the rest of the British  Caribbean  with complete Dominion Status within five years from the date of inauguration of the  West Indies Federation  with Canada.   However, plantation owners and merchants of British descent still dominated local politics, owing to the high income qualification required for voting. More than 70% of the population, many of them disenfranchised women, were excluded from the democratic process. It was not until the 1930s that the descendants of emancipated slaves began a movement for political rights. One of the leaders of this movement,  Sir Grantley Adams , founded the  Barbados Labour Party  in 1938, then known as the Barbados Progressive League. While being a staunch supporter of the monarchy, Adams and his party also demanded more rights for the poor and for the people. Progress toward a more democratic government in Barbados was made in 1942, when the exclusive income qualification was lowered and women were given the right to vote. By 1949 governmental control was wrested from the planters and, in 1958, Adams became Premier of Barbados.   From 1958 to 1962, Barbados was one of the ten members of the  West Indies Federation , an organisation doomed by nationalistic attitudes and by the fact that its members, as British colonies, held limited legislative power. Adams served as its first and only ""Premier"", but his leadership failed in attempts to form similar unions, and his continued defence of the monarchy was used by his opponents as evidence that he was no longer in touch with the needs of his country.  Errol Walton Barrow , a fervent reformer, became the new people's advocate. Barrow had left the BLP and formed the  Democratic Labour Party  as a liberal alternative to Adams' conservative government. Barrow instituted many progressive social programmes, such as free education for all Barbadians, and the School Meals system. By 1961, Barrow had replaced Adams as Premier and the DLP controlled the government.   With the Federation dissolved, Barbados had reverted to its former status, that of a  self-governing colony . The island negotiated its own independence at a constitutional conference with the United Kingdom in June 1966. After years of peaceful and democratic progress, Barbados finally became an independent state on 30 November 1966, with Errol Barrow its first Prime Minister. Upon independence Barbados maintained historical linkages with Britain by establishing membership to the  Commonwealth of Nations  grouping, a year later Barbados' International linkages were expanded by obtaining membership to the  United Nations  and the  Organization of American States .     [ edit ]   Government and politics          Parliamentary building.           Main articles:  Politics of Barbados  and  Monarchy of Barbados       Barbados has been an independent country since 30 November 1966. It functions as a  constitutional monarchy  and  parliamentary democracy , modeled on the British  Westminster system , with  Elizabeth II ,  Queen of Barbados , as  head of state  represented locally by the  Governor-General ,  Clifford Husbands  and the  Prime Minister  as the  head of the government . Its  Parliament  comprises thirty seats. It has been proposed that Barbados become a  republic  with a  president  replacing the  Barbadian sovereign ; this issue is still being debated, as the island has been stable and governmentally autonomous for decades.   Barbados is a full and participating member of the  Caribbean Community  (CARICOM), the  Caribbean (CARICOM) Single Market and Economy  (CSME), the  Caribbean Court of Justice  (CCJ), which pertains only to Barbados and  Guyana  but is expected to replace the UK  Privy Council  for the entire English-speaking Caribbean eventually, and the  Association of Caribbean States  (ACS). [ 7 ]   Barbados has a two party system, the two dominant parties being the ruling  Democratic Labour Party  and the  Barbados Labour Party . The Barbados Labour Party (BLP) had been in government for fifteen years, since 1993 until the 2008 general election. Under this administration, the Former Prime Minister, The Right Honourable Owen S. Arthur also acted as the Regional Leader of the CSM (Caribbean Single Market). The Right Honorable David Thompson is the Prime Minister of Barbados. [ 8 ]   On 11 April 2006, the 5-Member  UNCLOS  Annex VII Arbitral Tribunal, presided over by H.E. Judge  Stephen M. Schwebel , rendered after two years of international judicial proceedings, the landmark Barbados/Trinidad and Tobago Award, which resolved the maritime boundary delimitation (in the East, Central and West sectors) to satisfaction of both Parties and committed Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago to resolve their fisheries dispute by means of concluding a new Fisheries Agreement.     [ edit ]   Geography and climate of Barbados       Main article:  Geography and climate of Barbados              Map of Barbados              Beach near  Bridgetown , Barbados.       Barbados is extremely small for a Caribbean island. Relatively flat, it rises gently to the central highland region, the highest point being  Mount Hillaby , in the Scotland District, at 340 meters (1,100 ft) above sea level. The island is located in the Atlantic Ocean, to the east of the other Caribbean islands. The  climate  is tropical, with a rainy season from June to October.   Barbados is often spared the worst effects of the region's tropical storms and  hurricanes  during the rainy season as its far eastern location in the Atlantic Ocean puts it just outside the principal hurricane strike zone, and a hurricane hits about every 26 years. The last significant hit from a hurricane to cause severe damage to Barbados was  Hurricane Janet  in 1955.   In the parish of  Saint Michael  lies Barbados' capital and main city,  Bridgetown . Locally Bridgetown is sometimes referred to as ""The City"", but the most common reference is simply ""Town"". Other towns scattered across the island include  Holetown , in the parish of  Saint James ;  Oistins , in the parish of  Christ Church , and Speightstown, in the parish of  Saint Peter .   It is geologically composed of coral (90 m/300 ft thick). The land falls in a series of ""terraces"" in the west and goes into an incline in the east. Most of Barbados is circled by coral reefs.   The climate is moderate tropical with two seasons: dry and wet. The dry season (DecemberMay) and wet season (JuneNovember) gives an annual rainfall of 40-90 inches (1,0002,300 mm).     [ edit ]   Parishes       Main article:  Parishes of Barbados              Map of the parishes of Barbados       Barbados is  divided  into eleven administrative  parishes :     Christ Church   Saint Andrew   Saint George   Saint James   Saint John   Saint Joseph   Saint Lucy   Saint Michael   Saint Peter   Saint Philip   Saint Thomas       [ edit ]   Economy       Main article:  Economy of Barbados       Historically, the economy of Barbados had been dependent on  sugarcane  cultivation and related activities, but in recent years it has diversified into the  manufacturing  and  tourism  sectors. Offshore finance and information services have become important foreign exchange earners, and there is a healthy light manufacturing sector. In recent years the Government has been seen as business-friendly and economically sound. Since the late 1990s the island has seen a construction boom, with the development and redevelopment of hotels, office complexes, and homes.   The government continues its efforts to reduce  unemployment , encourage direct foreign investment, and privatize remaining state-owned enterprises. Unemployment has been reduced from around 14 percent in the past to under 10 percent.          Circulating  coins  2006       The economy contracted in 2001 and 2002 due to slowdowns in tourism, consumer spending and the impact of the  September 11, 2001 attacks , but rebounded in 2003 and has shown growth since 2004. Traditional trading partners include Canada, the  Caribbean Community  (especially  Trinidad and Tobago ), the United Kingdom and the United States.   Business links and investment flows have become substantial: as of 2003 the island saw from Canada  CA$  25 billion in investment holdings, placing it as one of Canada's top five destinations for Canadian  Foreign Direct Investment  (FDI). Businessman  Eugene Melnyk  of  Toronto , Canada, is said to be Barbados' richest permanent resident.   It was thought by key Barbadian industry sources that the year 2006 would have been one of the busiest years for building construction ever in Barbados, as the building-boom on the island entered the final stages for several multi-million dollar projects. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Transport       Main article:  Transport in Barbados       Transport on the island is good, with 'route taxis', called ""ZR's"" (pronounced "" Zed -Rs"" not ""Zee-Rs""), travelling to most points on the island. These small buses can at times be crowded, as passengers are generally never turned down, regardless of the their amount. However, they will usually take the more scenic routes to destinations. They generally depart from the capital  Bridgetown  or from  Speightstown  in the northern part of the island.          A  Mini Moke  at  Speightstown  beach       The island of Barbados's lone airport is the  Sir Grantley Adams International Airport (GAIA)  ( IATA  identifier  BGI ). It receives daily flights by several major airlines from points around the globe, as well as several smaller regional commercial airlines and charters. The airport serves as the main air-transportation hub for the Eastern Caribbean. It is undergoing a US$100 million upgrade and expansion.   There are three bus systems running seven days a week (though less frequently on Sundays), and a ride on any of them costs $1.50 BBD. The smaller buses from the two privately-owned systems (""ZRs"" and ""minibuses"") can give change; the larger blue and yellow buses from the government-operated  Barbados Transport Board  system cannot. Most routes require a connection in Bridgetown. Some drivers within the competitive privately owned systems are reluctant to advise persons to use competing services, even if those would be more suitable.   Some hotels also provide visitors with shuttles to points of interest on the island from outside the hotel lobby. There are several locally-owned and -operated vehicle rental agencies in Barbados but there are no multi-national car-rental agencies such as Avis, Europcar or Hertz.   There is also a helicopter shuttle service, which offers air taxi services to a number of sites around the island, mainly on the West Coast tourist belt. Air and water traffic is regulated by the  Barbados Port Authority .     [ edit ]   Tourist information   The island is well developed, and there are internationally known hotels offering world-class accommodation. Time-shares are available, and many of the smaller local hotels and private villas which dot the island have space available if booked in advance. The southern and western coasts of Barbados are popular, with the calm light blue Atlantic Ocean and their fine white and pinkish sandy beaches. Along the island's east coast the Atlantic Ocean side are tumbling waves which are perfect for light  surfing , but a little bit risky due to under-tow currents.   Shopping  districts are popular in Barbados, with ample duty-free shopping. There is also a festive night-life in mainly tourist areas such as the  Saint Lawrence Gap . Other attractions include wildlife reserves, jewelery stores,  scuba diving , helicopter rides,  golf ,  festivals  (the largest being the annual crop over festival July/Aug), sightseeing, cave exploration, exotic  drinks  and fine  clothes   shopping .     [ edit ]   Attractions, landmarks and points of interest   Tourism accounts for almost one half of the economy.

Close to 90 percent of all Barbadians (also known colloquially as  Bajan ) are of  African  descent (""Afro-Bajans""). A mix of many African ethnicities, notably the  Igbo ,  Akan  and  Yoruba people , they are mostly descendants of the  slave  labourers on the sugar plantations. The remainder of the population includes groups of Europeans (""Anglo-Bajans"" / ""Euro-Bajans"") mainly from the  United Kingdom , the  Republic of Ireland , Chinese locally known as Bajan-Chiney, Bajan Hindus from  India  and Muslims from  Bangladesh  and  Pakistan , and an influential ""Arab-Bajans"" group mainly of Christian  Syrians  and  Lebanese  descent. On the island are many people of  Creole  descent, a mixture of Afro-Caribbean and European descent (Primarily British, Irish and  Portuguese ).   Other groups in Barbados include people from the  United Kingdom ,  United States  and  Canada . Barbadians who return after years of residence in the U.S. are called ""Bajan Yankees""; this term is considered derogatory by some.   The country's official language is English, the local dialect of which is referred to as  Bajan , spoken by most. In religion, most Barbadians are  Christians  (67%), chiefly of the  Anglican Church , but there are Protestant,  Roman Catholic ,  Jehovah's Witness ,  Hindu ,  Muslim  and  Jewish  minorities. Barbados is a chief destination for emigrants from the South American nation of  Guyana . The biggest communities outside the Afro-Caribbean community are:     The  Indo-Guyanese , an important part of the economy due to the increase of immigrants from partner country  Guyana . There are reports of a growing Indo-Bajan diaspora originating from Guyana and  India . They introduced soca-chutney ,  roti  and many Indian dishes to Barbados' culture. Mostly from southern India and Hindu states, these 'Desi' peoples are growing in size but smaller than the equivalent communities in Trinidad & Guyana; Hinduism is one of Barbados' growing religions.   Euro-Bajans have settled in Barbados since the 1500s, originating from  England , Portugal, Ireland and  Scotland . More commonly they are known as "" White Bajans "", although some carry Afro-Caribbean traces and vice-versa. Euro-Bajans introduced folk music, such as  Irish music  and Highland music, and certain place names, such as ""Scotland"", a mountainous region, and ""Trafalgar Square"" in Bridgetown, now renamed ""Heroes Square"".   Chinese -Barbadians (or, as they are known on the island, ""Bajan-Chineys"") are a small portion of Barbados' Asian demographics, smaller than the equivalent communities of  Jamaica  and  Trinidad . Most if not all first arrived in the 1940s during the Second World War, originating mainly from the then British territory of  Hong Kong . Many Chinese-Bajans have the surnames Chin, Chynn or Lee, although other surnames prevail in certain areas of the island. Chinese food and culture is becoming part of everyday Bajan culture.   Lebanese and Syrians form the Middle Eastern community on the island and make up 89% of the Muslim population. Middle-Eastern Barbadians are often perceived to be the most successful group in business, along with the Chinese Bajans. During the  Arab Israeli Wars , many Syrians and Lebanese headed for the West Indies to escape conflict and poverty in the  Middle East . [ citation needed ]  Also Jewish people arrived in Barbados around the same time, creating the biggest synagogue in the West Indies.   Latin Americans have been migrating to the island since the 18th century, due to the close proximity of  South America , many  Venezuelans  had migrated to Barbados as labourers via Trinidad.  Brazilian Jews ,  Colombians  and  Panamanians  also live on the island. The Spanish language is now being encouraged to be taught as a second language in Barbadian schools over French.       [ edit ]   Culture          Banks beer at dusk           Main article:  Culture of Barbados     See also:  Music of Barbados     The influence of the English on Barbados is more noticeable than on other islands in the West Indies. A good example of this is the island's national sport:  cricket . Barbados has brought forth several great cricketers, including  Garfield Sobers  and  Frank Worrell .   Citizens are officially called Barbadians; Barbados' residents, however, colloquially refer to themselves or the products of the country as ""Bajan"". The term ""Bajan"" may have come from a localized pronunciation of the word Barbadian which at times can sound more like ""Bar-bajan"".   The largest  carnival -like cultural event which takes place on the island is the  Crop Over  festival. As in many other Caribbean and Latin American countries,  Crop Over  is an important event for many people on the island, as well as the thousands of tourists that flock to the island to participate in the annual events. The festival includes musical competitions and other traditional activities. It gets under way from the beginning of July, and ends with the costumed parade on Kadooment Day, held on the first Monday of August.   Barbados retains a strong British influence and is referred to by its neighbours as ""Little England"".     [ edit ]   Sports in Barbados     See also:  Cricket in the West Indies     As in other Caribbean countries of British descent,  cricket  is a favourite sport. In addition to several warm-up matches and six ""Super Eight"" matches, Barbados hosted the final of the  2007 Cricket World Cup .   In  golf , the  Barbados Open  is an annual stop on the  European Seniors Tour . In December 2006 the  WGC-World Cup  took place at the country's  Sandy Lane  resort on the Country Club course, an eighteen-hole course designed by  Tom Fazio .   Motorsports also play a role, with Rally Barbados occurring each summer and currently being listed on the FIA NACAM calendar.   Basketball  is a popular sport played at school or college and is increasing in popularity as is  volleyball , though volleyball is mainly played inside. At certain beaches such as Brandons beach in St. Michael people do get together to play  beach volleyball .   Other sports played include  hockey ,  table tennis ,  road tennis ,  football ,  rugby ,  polo  and  swimming .   Netball  is also popular with women in Barbados.     [ edit ]   National symbols     [ edit ]   Flower          A yellow and red Pride of Barbados ( Caesalpinia pulcherrima ).       The national flower is the Pride of Barbados or  Caesalpinia pulcherrima  (L.) Sw., which grows across the island.     [ edit ]   Flag   The tridented centered within the flag is a representation of the mythological Neptune, god of the sea. The trident in its original unbroken form was taken from the former colonial seal, which itself was replaced by the current coat of arms. Used within the national flag, the left and right shafts of the trident were then designed as 'broken' representing the nation of Barbados breaking away from its historical and constitutional ties as a former colony.   The three points of the  trident  represent in Barbados the three principles of  democracy  - ""government of, for and by the people."" The broken trident is set in a centered vertical band of gold representing the sands of Barbados' beaches. The gold band itself is surrounded on both sides by vertical bands of ultramarine (blue) representing the sea and sky of Barbados.   The design for the flag was created by Grantley W. Prescod and was chosen from an open competition arranged by the Barbados government. Over a thousand entries were received. [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   Golden Shield   The Golden Shield in the coat of arms carries two "" Pride of Barbados "" flowers and the ""bearded"" fig tree ( Ficus citrifolia  or  Ficus barbata ), which was common on the island at the time of its settlement by the British and may have contributed to Barbados being so named.     [ edit ]   Coat of arms   The  coat of arms  depicts two animals which are supporting the shield. On the left is a "" dolphin fish "", symbolic of the fishing industry and seagoing past of Barbados. On the right is a  pelican , symbolic of a small island named  Pelican Island  that once existed off the coast of Bridgetown. Above the shield is the helmet of Barbados with an extended arm clutching two  sugar-cane  stalks. The ""cross"" formation made by the cane stalks represents the saltire cross upon which  Saint Andrew  was crucified. On the base of the Coat of Arms reads ""Pride and Industry"" in reference to the country's motto.     [ edit ]   National heroes       Main article:  Barbadian national heroes       On April 1998, the Order of National Heroes Act was passed by the  Parliament of Barbados . According to the government, the act established that 28 April (the centenary of the birth of Sir Grantley Adams) would be celebrated as  National Heroes' Day . The act also declared that there are ten national heroes of Barbados. All of which would be elevated to the title of the The Right Excellent. [ 11 ]   The ten official National Heroes of Barbados are:-     Bussa  ( - 1816)   Sarah Ann Gill  (1795 - 1866)   Samuel Jackman Prescod  (1806 - 1871)   Dr. Charles Duncan ONeal  (1879 - 1936)   Clement Osbourne Payne  (1904 - 1941)   Sir Grantley Herbert Adams  (1898 - 1987)   Rt.

The South African coast stretches 2,798 kilometres (1,739 mi) [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  and borders both the  Atlantic  and  Indian   oceans . [ 7 ]  To the north of South Africa lie  Namibia ,  Botswana ,  Zimbabwe ,  Mozambique  and  Swaziland , while the  Kingdom of Lesotho  is an independent  enclave  surrounded by South African territory. [ 8 ]   Modern human beings have inhabited South Africa for more than 100,000 years. [ 9 ]  A century and a half after the discovery of the  Cape Sea Route , the  Dutch East India Company   founded  a refreshment station at what would become  Cape Town  in 1652. [ 10 ]  Cape Town became a British colony in 1806. European settlement expanded during the 1820s as the  Boers  (original  Dutch ,  Flemish ,  German  and  French  settlers) and the British  1820 Settlers  claimed land in the north and east of the country. Conflicts arose among the Xhosa, Zulu and Afrikaner groups. However, the discovery of diamonds and later gold triggered the conflict known as the  Anglo-Boer War  as the Boers and the British fought for the control of the South African mineral wealth. Although the Boers were defeated, limited independence was given to South Africa in 1910 as a British dominion. Anti-British policies focused on ultimate independence which was achieved in 1961 when South Africa was declared a  republic . The leading  National Party  legislated for a continuation of racial segregation begun under Dutch and British colonial rule, Boer republics, and subsequent South African governments (and which in 1948 became legally institutionalized  segregation  known as  apartheid ), despite opposition both in and outside of the country. In 1990 the then president  F.W. de Klerk  began to dismantle this legislation, and in 1994 the first democratic election was held in South Africa. This election brought  Nelson Mandela  and the current ruling party, the  African National Congress  to power, and the country rejoined the  Commonwealth of Nations .   South Africa is known for its diversity in cultures, languages, and religious beliefs, and eleven official languages are recognised in its  constitution . [ 7 ]  English is the most commonly spoken language in official and commercial public life, however it is only the fifth most spoken home language. [ 7 ]  South Africa is ethnically diverse, with the largest  Caucasian ,  Indian , and  racially mixed  communities in Africa. Although 79.6% of the South African population is  Black , [ 2 ]  this category is neither culturally nor linguistically homogenous, as people within this classification speak a number of different  Bantu languages , nine of which have official status. [ 7 ]  Midyear 2007, the South African population was estimated at 47.9 million.

(September 2008)           Main article:  History of South Africa       South Africa contains some of the oldest archaeological sites in the world. [ 11 ]   [ 12 ]  Extensive fossil remains at the  Sterkfontein ,  Kromdraai  and Makapansgat caves suggest that various  australopithecines  existed in South Africa from about three million years ago. [ 13 ]  These were succeeded by various species of  Homo , including  Homo habilis ,  Homo erectus  and modern humans,  Homo sapiens . Settlements of  Bantu -speaking peoples, who were  iron -using agriculturists and herdsmen, were already present south of the  Limpopo River  by the fourth or fifth century (see  Bantu expansion ) displacing and absorbing the original  KhoiSan  speakers. They slowly moved south and the earliest ironworks in modern-day  KwaZulu-Natal Province  are believed to date from around 1050. The southernmost group was the  Xhosa  people, whose language incorporates certain linguistic traits from the earlier KhoiSan people, reaching the  Fish River , in today's  Eastern Cape Province . These  Iron Age  populations displaced earlier people, who often had  hunter-gatherer  societies, as they migrated.     European colonisation          Painting of an account of the arrival of  Jan van Riebeeck , the first  European  to settle in South Africa, with  Devil's Peak  in the background       In 1487, the  Portuguese  explorer  Bartolomeu Dias  became the first European to reach the southernmost point of Africa. Initially named The Cape of Storms, The King of Portugal,  John II , renamed it the  Cabo da Boa Esperana  or  Cape of Good Hope  as it led to the riches of India. This great feat of navigation was later immortalized in  Cames ' epic Portuguese poem,  The Lusiads  (1572). In 1652, a refreshment station was established at the  Cape of Good Hope  by  Jan van Riebeeck  on behalf of the  Dutch East India Company .  Slaves  were brought from  Indonesia ,  Madagascar , and India as a labour source for the Dutch immigrants in  Cape Town . As they expanded east, the Dutch settlers eventually met the south-westerly expanding  Xhosa  people in the region of the  Fish River . A series of wars, called the  Cape Frontier Wars , ensued, mainly caused by conflicting land and livestock interests.   Great Britain  took over the  Cape of Good Hope  area in 1795 ostensibly to stop it falling into the hands of the Revolutionary French, but also seeking to use  Cape Town  in particular as a stop on the route to Australia and India. It was later returned to the Dutch in 1803, but soon afterwards the  Dutch East India Company  declared bankruptcy, and the British annexed the Cape Colony in 1806. The British continued the frontier wars against the Xhosa, pushing the eastern frontier eastward through a line of forts established along the Fish River and consolidating it by encouraging  British settlement . Due to pressure of  abolitionist  societies in Britain, the  British parliament  first stopped its global  slave trade  with the passage of the  Slave Trade Act 1807 , then abolished slavery in all its colonies with the  Slavery Abolition Act 1833 . During the 1830s, approximately 12 000  Boers  (later known as  Voortrekkers ), departed from the  Cape Colony , where they were subjected to British control, to the future Natal, Orange Free State and Transvaal regions. The Boers founded the  Boer Republics  - the  South African Republic  (Now  Gauteng ,  Limpopo ,  Mpumalanga  and  North West  provinces) and the  Orange Free State  ( Free State ).   The discovery of  diamonds  in 1867 and  gold  in 1884 in the interior encouraged economic growth and immigration, intensifying the subjugation of the indigenous people. These important economic resources did not only play a role between European and the indigenous population but also between the Boers and the British. [ 14 ]   The  Boer Republics  successfully resisted British encroachments during the  First Boer War  (18801881) using  guerrilla warfare  tactics, much better suited to local conditions. However, the British returned in greater numbers, more experience, and more suitable tactics in the  Second Boer War  (18991902). The Boers' attempt to ally themselves with  German South-West Africa  provided the British with yet another excuse to take control of the Boer Republics. [ citation needed ]           Boers  in combat (1881).         Independence   After four years of negotiating, the  Union of South Africa  was created from the  Cape  and  Natal  colonies, as well as the republics of  Orange Free State  and  Transvaal , on 31 May 1910, exactly eight years after the end of the Second Boer War. The newly created Union of South Africa was a  dominion . The  Natives' Land Act  of 1913 severely restricted the ownership of land by 'blacks', at that stage to a mere 7% of the country, although this amount was eventually increased marginally. [ 15 ]  The union was effectively granted independence from the United Kingdom with the passage of the  Statute of Westminster , which morphed the  British king's  position within South Africa into that of the distinct  King of South Africa . In 1934, the  South African Party  and  National Party  merged to form the  United Party , seeking reconciliation between Afrikaners and English-speaking ""Whites"", but split in 1939 over the entry of the Union into  World War II  as an ally of the United Kingdom, a move which the National Party strongly opposed.   In 1948, the  National Party  was elected to power, and intensified the implementation of racial segregation that had begun under Dutch and British colonial rule, and subsequent South African governments since the Union was formed. The Nationalist Government systematised existing segregationist laws, and the system of segregation became known collectively as  apartheid . Not surprisingly, this segregation also applied to the wealth acquired during rapid industrialisation of the 1950s, '60s, and '70s. While the White minority enjoyed the highest  standard of living  in all of Africa, often comparable to  First World  western nations, the Black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard, including income, education, housing, and life expectancy. On 31 May 1961, following a whites-only  referendum , the country became a  republic  and left the (British)  Commonwealth . The office of  Governor-General  was abolished and replaced with the position of  State President .   Apartheid became increasingly controversial, leading to widespread  sanctions ,  divestment  and growing unrest and oppression within South Africa. (See also the article on the  History of South Africa in the apartheid era .) A long period of harsh suppression by the government, and at times violent resistance,  strikes , marches, protests, and  sabotage  by bombing and other means, by various anti-apartheid movements, most notably the  African National Congress  (ANC), followed. In the late 1970s, South Africa began a programme of  nuclear weapons  development and in the following decade it produced six deliverable nuclear weapons. The rationale for the nuclear arsenal is disputed, but it is believed [ who? ]  that  Vorster  and  P.W. Botha  wanted to be able to catalyse American intervention in the event of a war between South Africa and the  Cuban -supported  MPLA  government of  Angola .     Democracy   In 1990 the  National Party  government took the first step towards negotiating itself out of power when it lifted the ban on the  African National Congress  and other  left-wing  political organisations, and released  Nelson Mandela  from prison after twenty-seven years' incarceration on a  sabotage  sentence. Apartheid legislation was gradually removed from the statute books, and South Africa also destroyed its nuclear arsenal and acceded to the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . The first  multi-racial elections  were held in 1994, which the ANC won by an overwhelming majority. It has been in power ever since.   In  post-apartheid South Africa , millions of South Africans, mostly black, continued to live in  poverty , though poverty among whites, previously rare, has increased greatly. [ 16 ]  While some have partly attributed this to the legacy of the apartheid system, increasingly many attribute it to the failure of the current government to tackle social issues, coupled with the monetary and fiscal discipline of the current government to ensure both redistribution of wealth and economic growth. Since the ANC-led government took power, the  United Nations   Human Development Index  of South Africa has fallen, while it was steadily rising until the mid-1990s. [ 17 ]  Some of this could possibly be attributed to the  AIDS   pandemic  and the failure of the government to take steps to address it, [ 18 ] some of it can also be pinpointed to a government policy of  redistribution of wealth . As a mitigating factor, the social housing policy of the current government has produced an improvement in living conditions.     Politics       Main articles:  Politics of South Africa ,  Government of South Africa , and  Law of South Africa              The  Union Buildings  in  Pretoria  is the home of the South African executive.       South Africa has three capital cities:  Cape Town , the largest of the three, is the  legislative  capital;  Pretoria  is the  administrative  capital; and  Bloemfontein  is the  judicial  capital. South Africa has a  bicameral   parliament : the  National Council of Provinces  (the  upper house ) has 90 members, while the  National Assembly  (the  lower house ) has 400 members. Members of the lower house are elected on a population basis by  proportional representation : half of the members are elected from national lists and the other half are elected from provincial lists. Ten members are elected to represent each province in the National Council of Provinces, regardless of the population of the province. Elections for both chambers are held every five years. The government is formed in the lower house, and the leader of the majority party in the National Assembly is the  President .   The primary sources of South Africa law are Roman-Dutch mercantile law and personal law with English Common law, as imports of Dutch settlements and  British colonialism . [ 19 ]  The first European based law in South Africa was brought by the  Dutch East India Company  and is called  Roman-Dutch law . It was imported before the  codification  of European law into the  Napoleonic Code  and is comparable in many ways to  Scots law . This was followed in the 19th century by  English law , both  common  and  statutory . Starting in 1910 with unification, South Africa had its own  parliament  which passed laws specific for South Africa, building on those previously passed for the individual member colonies.   Current South African politics are dominated by the  African National Congress  (ANC), which received 69.7% of the vote during the last  2004 general election  and 66.3% of the vote in the  2006 municipal election . The current  President of South Africa  is  Kgalema Motlanthe , who replaced  Thabo Mbeki  on 25 September 2008. Mbeki succeeded former President  Nelson Mandela  in 1999, and was re-elected for a second five year term in 2004, but announced his resignation on 20 September 2008.   The main challenger to the rule of the ANC is the  Democratic Alliance  party, which received 12.4% of the vote in the 2004 election and 14.8% in the 2006 election.  Helen Zille , (elected 6 May 2007), is the party leader; the previous leader was  Tony Leon . The formerly dominant  New National Party , which introduced apartheid through its predecessor, the  National Party , chose to merge with the ANC on 9 April 2005. Other major political parties represented in Parliament are the  Inkatha Freedom Party , which mainly represents  Zulu  voters, and the  Independent Democrats , who took 6.97% and 1.7% of the vote respectively, in the 2004 election.   Since 2004, the country has had many thousands of popular protests, some violent, making it, according to one academic, the ""most protest-rich country in the world"". [ 20 ]  Many of these protests have been organised from the growing  shanty towns  that surround South African cities.     Foreign relations and military       Main articles:  South African National Defence Force ,  Foreign relations of South Africa , and  South Africa and weapons of mass destruction       Since the end of apartheid, the South African foreign policy has focused on its African partners particularly in the  Southern African Development Community  (SADC) and the  African Union . South Africa has played a key role as a mediator in African conflicts over the last decade, such as in  Burundi , the  Democratic Republic of Congo , the  Comoros , and  Zimbabwe . After apartheid ended, South Africa was readmitted to the  Commonwealth of Nations . As the  Union of South Africa , South Africa was a founding member of the  United Nations  and the then Prime Minister  Jan Smuts  wrote the preamble to its constitution. South Africa is currently a non-permanent member of the  United Nations Security Council  and has attracted controversy by voting against a resolution criticising the  Burmese  government in 2006 and against the implementation of sanctions against  Zimbabwe  in 2008. South Africa is a member of the  Group of 77  and chaired the organisation in 2006. South Africa is a member of the  South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone ,  Southern African Customs Union ,  World Trade Organization ,  International Monetary Fund ,  G20  and  G8+5 .   The South African  armed forces , known as the  South African National Defence Force  (SANDF), was created in 1994. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  Previously known as the  South African Defence Force  (SADF), the new force is an all volunteer army and consists of the forces of the old SADF, as well as the forces of the African nationalist groups, namely  Umkhonto we Sizwe  (MK),  Azanian People's Liberation Army  (APLA), and the former  Bantustan  defence forces. [ 21 ]  The SANDF is subdivided into four branches, the  South African Army , the  South African Air Force , the  South African Navy , and the  South African Military Health Services . [ 23 ]   In recent years, the SANDF has become a major  peacekeeping  force in Africa, [ 24 ]  and has been involved in operations in  Lesotho , the  Democratic Republic of the Congo , [ 24 ]  and  Burundi , [ 24 ]  amongst others. It has also participated as a part of multi-national  UN  peacekeeping forces.   South Africa undertook a nuclear weapons programme in the 1970s [ 25 ]  and  may have conducted  a nuclear test over the  Atlantic  in 1979. [ 26 ]  It is the only African country to have successfully  developed nuclear weapons . It has become the first country (followed by Ukraine) with nuclear capability to voluntarily renounce and dismantle its programme and in the process signed the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty  in 1991.

To this end, it abolished the four former provinces of South Africa ( Cape Province ,  Natal ,  Orange Free State , and  Transvaal ) and replaced them with nine fully integrated provinces. The new provinces are usually much smaller than the former provinces, which theoretically gives local governments more resources to distribute over smaller areas.   The nine provinces are further subdivided into  52 districts :  6 metropolitan  and  46 district municipalities . The 46 district municipalities are further subdivided into  231 local municipalities . The district municipalities also contain 20 district management areas (mostly game parks) that are directly governed by the district municipalities. The six metropolitan municipalities perform the functions of both district and local municipalities.

At 470,979  sq mi  (1,219,912 km), [ 27 ]  South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world (after  Mali ). It is comparable in size to  Colombia .  Njesuthi  in the  Drakensberg  at 3,408 m (11,424 ft) is the highest peak in South Africa.          View of the  Drakensberg mountains , the highest mountain range in South Africa.       South Africa has a generally  temperate climate , due in part to it being surrounded by the  Atlantic  and  Indian Oceans  on three sides, by its location in the climatically milder  southern hemisphere  and due to the average elevation rising steadily towards the north (towards the  equator ) and further inland. Due to this varied topography and oceanic influence, a great variety of climatic zones exist.   The climatic zones vary, from the extreme  desert  of the southern  Namib  in the farthest northwest to the lush  subtropical  climate in the east along the  Mozambique  border and the  Indian  ocean. From the east, the land quickly rises over a  mountainous   escarpment  towards the interior  plateau  known as the  Highveld . Even though South Africa is classified as  semi-arid , there is considerable variation in  climate  as well as  topography .   The interior of South Africa is a vast, rather flat, and sparsely populated  scrubland ,  Karoo , which is drier towards the northwest along the Namib desert. In contrast, the eastern coastline is lush and well-watered, which produces a climate similar to the tropics. The extreme southwest has a climate remarkably similar to that of the  Mediterranean  with wet winters and hot, dry summers, hosting the famous  Fynbos   Biome . This area also produces much of the  wine  in South Africa. This region is also particularly known for its wind, which blows intermittently almost all year. The severity of this wind made passing around the  Cape of Good Hope  particularly treacherous for sailors, causing many  shipwrecks . Further east on the south coast, rainfall is distributed more evenly throughout the year, producing a green landscape. This area is popularly known as the  Garden Route .          Satellite picture of South Africa       The  Free State  is particularly flat due to the fact that it lies centrally on the high plateau. North of the  Vaal River , the Highveld becomes better watered and does not experience subtropical extremes of heat.  Johannesburg , in the centre of the Highveld, is at 1,740 metres (5,709 ft) and receives an annual rainfall of 760 millimetres (30  in ). Winters in this region are cold, although  snow  is rare.   To the north of Johannesburg, the altitude drops beyond the escarpment of the Highveld, and turns into the lower lying Bushveld, an area of mixed dry forest and an abundance of wildlife. East of the Highveld, beyond the eastern escarpment, the Lowveld stretches towards the  Indian  ocean. It has particularly high temperatures, and is also the location of extended subtropical agriculture.   The high  Drakensberg mountains , which form the south-eastern escarpment of the Highveld, offer limited  skiing  opportunities in winter. The coldest place in South Africa is  Sutherland  in the western  Roggeveld Mountains , where midwinter temperatures can reach as low as 15 degrees  Celsius  (5  F ). The deep interior has the hottest temperatures: A temperature of 51.7 C (125 F) was recorded in 1948 in the  Northern Cape  Kalahari near  Upington . [ 28 ]   South Africa also has one possession, the small sub-Antarctic archipelago of the  Prince Edward Islands , consisting of  Marion Island  (290 km/112 sq mi) and Prince Edward Island (45 km/17.3 sq mi) (not to be confused with the  Canadian province of the same name ).           Weather averages for Cape Town, South Africa         Month   Jan   Feb   Mar   Apr   May   Jun   Jul   Aug   Sep   Oct   Nov   Dec   Year       Average high C (F)   27  (81)   28  (82)   26  (79)   24  (75)   20  (68)   18  (64)   17  (63)   18  (64)   19  (66)   22  (72)   24  (75)   26  (79)   28  (82)       Average low C (F)   16  (61)   16  (61)   15  (59)   13  (55)   10  (50)   8  (46)   8  (46)   8  (46)   9  (48)   11  (52)   14  (57)   15  (59)   8  (46)       Precipitation  mm (inches)   16.5  (0.65)   13  (0.51)   20  (0.79)   54  (2.13)   92  (3.62)   111  (4.37)   96  (3.78)   87  (3.43)   56  (2.2)   40  (1.57)   24  (0.94)   18  (0.71)   627  (24.69)       Source: EuroWEATHER [ 29 ]  2008-02-22         Flora and fauna     See also:  Wildlife of South Africa   See also:  Protected areas of South Africa             Fynbos , a  floral kingdom  unique to South Africa, is found near  Cape Town               Swartberg  mountains near the town of  Oudtshoorn              A field of flowers in Weskus National Park.       South Africa is one of only 17 countries worldwide considered  megadiverse . It has more than 20,000 different  plants , or about 10% of all the known  species  of plants on  Earth , making it particularly rich in plant biodiversity. South Africa is the 6th most biodiverse country, [ 30 ]  after  Brazil ,  Colombia ,  Indonesia ,  China , and  Mexico . The most prevalent biome in South Africa is the  grassland , particularly on the  Highveld , where the plant cover is dominated by different  grasses , low  shrubs , and  acacia trees , mainly camel-thorn and whitethorn.  Vegetation  becomes even more sparse towards the northwest due to low  rainfall . There are several species of water-storing  succulents  like  aloes  and euphorbias in the very hot and dry  Namaqualand  area. The grass and thorn  savannah  turns slowly into a bush savannah towards the north-east of the country, with denser growth. There are significant numbers of  baobab  trees in this area, near the northern end of  Kruger National Park . [ 31 ]   The  Fynbos   Biome , which makes up the majority of the area and plant life in the  Cape floristic region , one of the six  floral kingdoms , is located in a small region of the  Western Cape  and contains more than 9,000 of those species, making it among the richest regions on earth in terms of floral biodiversity. The majority of the plants are  evergreen  hard-leaf plants with fine, needle-like  leaves , such as the  sclerophyllous  plants. Another uniquely South African plant is the  protea  genus of flowering plants. There are around 130 different species of protea in South Africa.   While South Africa has a great wealth of flowering plants, it has few  forests . Only 1% of South Africa is forest, almost exclusively in the  humid   coastal plain  along the  Indian Ocean  in  KwaZulu-Natal  (see  KwaZulu-Cape coastal forest mosaic ). There are even smaller reserves of forests that are out of the reach of  fire , known as montane forests (see  Knysna-Amatole montane forests ).  Plantations  of imported tree species are predominant, particularly the non-native  eucalyptus  and  pine . South Africa has lost a large area of natural habitat in the last four decades, primarily due to  overpopulation , sprawling development patterns and  deforestation  during the nineteenth century. South Africa is one of the worst affected countries in the world when it comes to invasion by alien species with many (e.g.  Black Wattle ,  Port Jackson ,  Hakea ,  Lantana  and  Jacaranda ) posing a significant threat to the native  biodiversity  and the already scarce water resources. The original  temperate forest  that met the first European settlers to South Africa was exploited ruthlessly until only small patches remained. Currently, South African  hardwood  trees like  Real Yellowwood   (Podocarpus latifolius) ,  stinkwood   (Ocotea bullata) , and South African  Black Ironwood   (Olea laurifolia)  are under government protection.   Numerous  mammals  are found in the  bushveld  habitats including  lions ,  leopards ,  white rhinos ,  blue wildebeest ,  kudus ,  impalas ,  hyenas ,  hippopotamus  and  giraffes . A significant extent of the bushveld habitat exists in the north-east including  Kruger National Park  and the  Mala Mala  Reserve, as well as in the far north in the  Waterberg Biosphere .   Climate change is expected to bring considerable warming and drying to much of this already semi-arid region, with greater frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, flooding and drought. According to computer generated climate modelling produced by the South African National Biodiversity Institute [ 32 ]  parts of southern Africa will see an increase in temperature by about one degree Celsius along the coast to more than four degrees Celsius in the already hot hinterland such as the  Northern Cape  in late spring and summertime by 2050.   The Cape Floral Kingdom has been identified as one of the global  biodiversity hotspots  since it will be hit very hard by  climate change  and has such a great diversity of life. Drought, increased intensity and frequency of fire and climbing temperatures are expected to push many of these  rare species  towards  extinction .   South Africa houses many endemic species, among them the  critically endangered   Riverine Rabbit  ( Bunolagus monticullaris ) in the  Karoo .     Economy       Main article:  Economy of South Africa              The  Victoria & Alfred Waterfront  in  Cape Town  with  Table Mountain  in the background. Cape Town has become an important  retail  and  tourism  centre for the country, and attracts the largest number of foreign visitors in South Africa       By  UN  classification South Africa is a middle-income country with an abundant supply of resources, well-developed financial, legal, communications, energy, and transport sectors, a  stock exchange  (the  JSE Limited ), that ranks among the top twenty in the world, and a modern infrastructure supporting an efficient distribution of goods to major urban centres throughout the entire region. South Africa is ranked 25th in the world in terms of  GDP  (PPP) as of 2007.   Advanced development is significantly localised around four areas: Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Durban, and Pretoria/Johannesburg. Beyond these four economic centres, development is marginal and poverty is still prevalent despite government efforts. Consequently the vast majority of South Africans are poor. However, key marginal areas have experienced rapid growth recently. Such areas include Mossel Bay to Plettenberg Bay; Rustenburg area; Nelspruit area; Bloemfontein; Cape West Coast; and the KwaZulu-Natal North Coast.   Even though South Africa has the seventh highest per capita income in Africa, only behind  Libya ,  Mauritius  it suffers from large income gaps and a  dual economy  marking it as a  developing country . South Africa has one of the highest rates of  income inequality  in the world. A decade of continual economic growth has helped to lower unemployment, but daunting economic and social problems remain. The average South African household income decreased considerably between 1995 and 2000. As for racial inequality,  Statistics South Africa  reported that in 1995 the average white household earned four times as much as the average black household. In 2000 the average white household was earning six times more than the average black household. [ 33 ]  The  affirmative action  policies have seen a rise in black economic wealth and an emerging black middle class. [ 34 ]  Other problems are crime, corruption, and  HIV / AIDS .   At the start of 2000, then President Thabo Mbeki vowed to promote economic growth and foreign investment by relaxing restrictive labour laws, stepping up the pace of  privatisation , and cutting unneeded governmental spending. His policies face strong opposition from organised  labour . South Africa is also the largest energy producer and consumer on the continent. South Africa is a popular tourist destination, and a substantial amount of revenue comes from tourism. [ 35 ]  Among the main attractions are the diverse and picturesque culture, the game reserves and the highly regarded local wines.   The South African  rand  (ZAR), is the most actively traded emerging  market currency  in the world. It has joined an elite club of fifteen currencies, the  Continuous linked settlement  (CLS), where forex transactions are settled immediately, lowering the risks of transacting across  time zones . The rand was the best-performing currency against the  United States dollar  (USD) between 2002 and 2005, according to the  Bloomberg  Currency Scorecard.   The volatility of the  rand  has affected economic activity, falling sharply during 2001 and hitting a historic low of 13.85  ZAR  to the  USD , raising fears of inflation, and causing the Reserve Bank to increase  interest rates . The rand has since recovered, trading at 7.13 ZAR to the dollar as of January 2008. However, as exporters are put under considerable pressure from a stronger domestic currency, many call for government intervention to help soften the rand.   Refugees from poorer neighbouring countries include many immigrants from the DRC, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Malawi and others, representing a large portion of the informal sector. With high unemployment levels amongst poorer South Africans,  xenophobia  is prevalent and many people born in South Africa feel resentful of immigrants who are seen to be depriving the native population of jobs, a feeling which has been given credibility by the fact that many South African employers have employed migrants from other countries for lower pay than South African citizens, especially in the  construction ,  tourism ,  agriculture  and  domestic service  industries. Illegal immigrants are also heavily involved in informal trading. [ 36 ]  However, many immigrants to South Africa continue to live in poor conditions, and the South African immigration policy has become increasingly restrictive since 1994. [ 37 ]   Principal international trading partners of South Africa  besides other African countries  include  Germany ,  Japan ,  Switzerland , the  United Kingdom , and the  United States . Chief exports include  corn ,  diamonds ,  fruits ,  gold ,  metals  and  minerals ,  sugar , and  wool .  Machinery  and transportation equipment make up more than one-third of the value of the countrys imports. Other imports include  chemicals , manufactured goods, and  petroleum .     Electricity crisis   After unsuccessful attempts by the government to encourage private construction of electricity generation capacity, in 2007 the state-owned electricity supplier ( Eskom ) started experiencing a lack of capacity in the electrical generating and reticulation infrastructure. This led to an inability to meet the routine demands of industry and consumers, resulting in countrywide  rolling blackouts . Initially the lack of capacity was triggered by a failure at  Koeberg nuclear power station , but since then a general lack of capacity became evident. The supplier has been widely criticised for failing to adequately plan for and construct sufficient electrical generating capacity, [ 38 ]  although ultimately the government has admitted that it is at fault for refusing to approve funding for investment in infrastructure. [ 39 ]     Agriculture          Workers planting on a farm in the central area of  Mpumalanga .               Farm  workers.       South Africa has a large agricultural sector and is a net exporter of  farming  products. There are almost a thousand  agricultural cooperatives  and  agribusinesses  throughout the country, and agricultural exports have constituted 8% of South African total exports for the past five years. The agricultural industry contributes around 10% of formal employment, relatively low compared to other parts of Africa, as well as providing work for casual labourers and contributing around 2.6% of  GDP  for the nation. [ 40 ]  However, due to the  aridity  of the land, only 13.5% can be used for crop production, and only 3% is considered high potential land. [ 41 ]   Although the commercial farming sector is relatively well developed, people in some rural areas still survive on  subsistence agriculture . It is the eighth largest wine producer in the world, and the eleventh largest producer of sunflower seed. South Africa is a net exporter of agricultural products and foodstuffs, the largest number of exported items being  sugar ,  grapes ,  citrus ,  nectarines ,  wine  and  deciduous  fruit. The largest locally produced crop is  maize  (corn), and it has been estimated that 9 million tons are produced every year, with 7.4 million tons being consumed.  Livestock  are also popular on South African farms, with the country producing 85% of all meat consumed. The dairy industry consists of around 4,300 milk producers providing employment for 60,000 farm workers and contributing to the livelihoods of around 40,000 others. [ 42 ]   In recent years, the agricultural sector has introduced several reforms, some of which are controversial, such as  land reform  and the deregulation of the market for agricultural products. Land reform has been criticised both by farmers' groups and by landless workers, the latter alleging that the pace of change has not been fast enough, and the former alleging racist treatment and expressing concerns that a similar situation to  Zimbabwe's land reform policy  may develop, [ 43 ]  a fear exacerbated by comments made by  deputy president , the deputy president of South Africa. [ 44 ] [ 45 ]  The sector continues to face problems, with increased foreign competition and crime being two of the major challenges for the industry. The government has been accused of either putting in too much effort [ 46 ] , or not enough effort [ 47 ] , to tackle the problem of  farm attacks  as opposed to other forms of violent crime.   Another issue which affects South African agriculture is environmental damage caused by misuse of the land and global climate change. South Africa is unusually vulnerable to climate change and resultant diminution of surface waters. Some predictions show surface water supply could decrease by 60% by the year 2070 in parts of the Western Cape. [ 48 ]  To reverse the damage caused by land mismanagement, the government has supported a scheme which promotes  sustainable development  and the use of natural resources. [ 49 ]  Maize production, which contributes to a 36% majority of the gross value of South Africas field crops, has also experienced negative effects due to climate change. The estimated value of loss, which takes into consideration scenarios with and without the carbon dioxide fertilization effect [2]  ,ranges between 10s to 100s of millions of Rands.

South Africa is a nation of more than 48 million people of diverse origins,  cultures ,  languages , and  religions . The last  census  was held in 2001 and the next will be in 2011.  Statistics South Africa  provided five  racial  categories by which people could classify themselves, the last of which, ""unspecified/other"" drew negligible responses, and these results were omitted. [ 51 ]  The 2006 midyear estimated figures for the other categories were  Black African  at 79.5%,  White  at 9.2%,  Coloured  at 8.9%, and  Indian or Asian  at 2.5%. [ 52 ]  Even though the population of South Africa has increased in the past decade [ 51 ] [ 53 ]  (primarily due to immigration), the country had an annual population growth rate of 0.501% in 2008 (CIA est.), including immigration. [ 54 ]  South Africa is home to an estimated 5 million  illegal immigrants , including some 3 million  Zimbabweans . [ 55 ] [ 56 ] [ 57 ]  A series of  anti-immigrant riots  occurred in South Africa beginning on 11 May 2008. [ 58 ] [ 59 ]   By far the major part of the population classified itself as African or black, but it is not culturally or linguistically homogeneous. Major ethnic groups include the  Zulu ,  Xhosa ,  Basotho  (South Sotho),  Bapedi  (North Sotho),  Venda ,  Tswana ,  Tsonga ,  Swazi  and  Ndebele , all of which speak  Bantu languages  (see  Bantu peoples of South Africa ).   Some, such as the Zulu, Xhosa, Bapedi and Venda groups, are unique to South Africa. Other groups are distributed across the borders with neighbours of South Africa: The  Basotho  group is also the major ethnic group in  Lesotho . The  Tswana  ethnic group constitute the majority of the population of  Botswana . The  Swazi  ethnic group is the major ethnic group in  Swaziland . The  Ndebele  ethnic group is also found in  Matabeleland  in  Zimbabwe , where they are known as the  Matabele . These Ndebele people are the descendants of a Zulu faction under the warrior  Mzilikazi  that escaped persecution from  Shaka  by migrating to their current territory. The  Tsonga  ethnic group is also found in southern  Mozambique , where they are known as the Shangaan.   The white population is not ethnically homogenous and descend from many ethnic groups:  Dutch ,  Flemish ,  Portuguese , German, French  Huguenot , English, Irish, Italian, Scottish and  Welsh . Culturally and linguistically, they are divided into the  Afrikaners , who speak  Afrikaans , and English-speaking groups, many of whom are descended from British and Irish immigrants (see  Anglo-African ). Many small communities that have immigrated over the last century retain the use of other languages. The  white population  is on the decrease due to a low birth rate and emigration; as a factor in their decision to emigrate, many cite the high  crime  rate and the  affirmative action  policies of the government. Since 1994, approximately 1 000 000 white South Africans have permanently emigrated. [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ] [ 63 ]  Despite high emigration levels, a high level of non-South African white immigrants have settled in the country, in particular from countries such as  Britain  and  Zimbabwe . For example, by 2005, an estimated 212 000 British citizens were residing in South Africa. Since 2003, the numbers of British migrants coming to South Africa has risen by 50%. An estimated 20 000 British migrants moved to South Africa in 2007. There have also been a significant number of  white Zimbabwean  arrivals, fleeing their home country in light of the economic and political problems currently facing the country. As well as recent arrivals, a significant number of white Zimbabweans emigrated to South Africa in the wake of independence in Zimbabwe in 1980. Some of the more nostalgic members of the community are known in popular culture as "" Whenwes "", because of their nostalgia for their lives in  Rhodesia  ""when we were in Rhodesia"". [ 64 ]   The term  Coloured  is still largely used for the people of mixed race descended from slaves brought in from East and Central Africa, the indigenous  Khoisan  who lived in the  Cape  at the time, Bantus, Whites (mostly the  Dutch / Afrikaner  and British settlers) as well as an admixture of  Javanese ,  Malay , Indian,  Malagasy  and Asian blood (such as  Burmese ). The majority speak Afrikaans. Khoisan is a term used to describe two separate groups, physically similar: light-skinned and small in stature. The  Khoikhoi , who were called  Hottentots  by the Europeans, were pastoralists and were annihilated; the San, called  Bushmen  by the Europeans, were hunter-gatherers. Within the Coloured community, more recent immigrants will also be found: Coloureds from the former  Rhodesia  (now  Zimbabwe );  Namibia  and immigrants of mixed descent from India and  Burma  ( Anglo-Indians / Anglo-Burmese ) who were welcomed to the Cape when India and Burma received their Independence.   The major part of the South African  Asian  population is Indian in origin (see  Indian South Africans ); many of them descended from indentured workers brought in the nineteenth century to work on the  sugar   plantations  of the eastern coastal area then known as  Natal . There is also a significant group of  Chinese South Africans  (approximately 100,000 individuals) and  Vietnamese  South Africans (approximately 50,000 individuals). In 2008, the Pretoria High Court has ruled that Chinese South Africans who arrived before 1994 are to be reclassified as  Coloureds . As a result of this ruling, about 12,000 - 15,000  [ 65 ] ethnically Chinese citizens who arrived before 1994, numbering 3%-5% of the total Chinese population in the country, will be able to benefit from government  BEE  policies. [ 66 ]   South Africa hosts a sizeable refugee and asylum seeker population. According to the  World Refugee Survey 2008 , published by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, this population numbered approximately 144,700 in 2007. [ 67 ]  Groups of refugees and asylum seekers numbering over 10,000 included people from  Zimbabwe  (48,400), The  Democratic Republic of the Congo  (24,800), and  Somalia  (12,900). [ 67 ]  These populations mainly lived in Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban, Cape Town, and Port Elizabeth. [ 67 ]     Science and technology   Several important scientific and technological developments have originated in South Africa.  The first human to human heart transplant was performed by cardiac surgeon  Christiaan Barnard  at  Groote Schuur Hospital  in December 1967  .  Max Theiler  developed a vaccine against Yellow Fever,  Allan McLeod Cormack  pioneered x-ray  Computed tomography , and  Aaron Klug  developed crystallographic electron microscopy techniques. These advancements were all recognized with  Nobel Prizes .  Sydney Brenner  won most recently, in 2002, for his pioneering work in  molecular biology .   Mark Shuttleworth  founded an early Internet security company  Thawte , that was subsequently bought out by world-leader  VeriSign . Despite government efforts to encourage entrepreneurship in biotechnology, IT and other high technology fields, no other notable groundbreaking companies have been founded in South Africa. However, it is the expressed objective of the government to transition the economy to be more reliant on high technology, based on the realization that South African cannot compete with Far Eastern economies in manufacturing, nor can the republic rely on its mineral wealth in perpetuity.   South Africa has cultivated a burgeoning astronomy community. It hosts the  Southern African Large Telescope , the largest optical telescope in the southern hemisphere. South Africa is currently building the  Karoo Array Telescope  as a pathfinder for the $20 billion  Square Kilometer Array  project. South Africa is a finalist, with Australia, to be the host of the SKA.     Society and culture       Main article:  Culture of South Africa              Decorated houses,  Drakensberg Mountains              Traditional  South African cuisine .       It may be argued that there is no ""single"" culture in South Africa because of its ethnic diversity. Today, the diversity in foods from many cultures is enjoyed by all and especially marketed to tourists who wish to sample the large variety of South African cuisine. In addition to  food ,  music  and  dance  feature prominently.   South African cuisine  is heavily  meat-based  and has spawned the distinctively South African social gathering known as a  braai , or barbecue. South Africa has also developed into a major  wine  producer, with some of the best  vineyards  lying in valleys around  Stellenbosch ,  Franschoek ,  Paarl  and  Barrydale . [ 68 ]   There is great diversity in music from South Africa. Many black musicians who sang in Afrikaans or English during apartheid have since begun to sing in traditional African languages, and have developed a unique style called  Kwaito . Of note is  Brenda Fassie , who launched to fame with her song ""Weekend Special"", which was sung in English. More famous traditional musicians include  Ladysmith Black Mambazo , while the  Soweto String Quartet  performs classic music with an African flavour. White and Coloured South African singers are historically influenced by European musical styles including such western metal bands such as  Seether  (formerly Saron Gas). South Africa has produced world-famous jazz musicians, notably  Hugh Masekela ,  Jonas Gwangwa ,  Abdullah Ibrahim ,  Miriam Makeba ,  Jonathan Butler ,  Chris McGregor , and  Sathima Bea Benjamin .  Afrikaans  music covers multiple genres, such as the  contemporary   Steve Hofmeyr  and the  punk rock  band  Fokofpolisiekar . Crossover artists such as  Johnny Clegg  and his bands  Juluka  and  Savuka  have enjoyed various success underground, publicly, and abroad.   The South African black majority still has a substantial number of rural inhabitants who lead largely impoverished lives. It is among these people, however, that cultural traditions survive most strongly; as blacks have become increasingly  urbanised  and  westernised , aspects of traditional culture have declined. Urban blacks usually speak English or  Afrikaans  in addition to their native tongue. There are smaller but still significant groups of speakers of  Khoisan languages  who are not included in the eleven official languages, but are one of the eight other officially recognised languages. There are small groups of speakers of  endangered languages , most of which are from the Khoi-San family, that receive no official status; however, some groups within South Africa are attempting to promote their use and revival.   The  middle class  lifestyle, predominantly of the white minority but with growing numbers of Black, Coloured and Indian people, [ 69 ]  is similar in many respects to that of people found in  Western Europe , North America and  Australasia . Members of the middle class often study and work abroad for greater exposure to the markets of the world.   Asians , predominantly of Indian origin, preserve their own cultural heritage, languages and religious beliefs, being either  Christian ,  Hindu  or  Sunni Muslim  and speaking English, with Indian languages like  Hindi ,  Telugu ,  Tamil  or  Gujarati  being spoken less frequently, but the majority of Indians being able to understand their mother tongue. The first Indians arrived on the famous  Truro ship  as  indentured labourers  in Natal to work the Sugar Cane Fields. There is a much smaller  Chinese  community in South Africa, although its numbers have increased due to immigration from  Republic of China  (Taiwan).   South Africa has also had a large influence in the  Scouting  movement, with many Scouting traditions and ceremonies coming from the experiences of  Robert Baden-Powell  (the founder of Scouting) during his time in South Africa as a military officer in the 1890s. The  South African Scout Association  was one of the first youth organisations to open its doors to youth and adults of all races in South Africa. This happened on 2 July 1977 at a conference known as  Quo Vadis . [ 70 ]   The South African music scene consists of  Kwaito , a new music genre that had developed in the mid 80s and has since developed to become the most popular social economical form of representation among the populous. Though some may argue that the political aspects of Kwaito has since diminished after  Apartheid , and the relative interest in politics has become a minor aspect of daily life. Some argue that in a sense,  Kwaito  is in fact a political force that shows activism in its apolitical actions. Today, major corporations like  Sony ,  BMG , and  EMI  have appeared on the South African scene to produce and distribute  Kwaito  music. Due to its overwhelming popularity, as well as the general influence of DJs, who are among the top 5 most influential types of people within the country,  Kwaito  has taken over radio, television, and magazines. [ 71 ]   Kwaito , much like most hip-hop has its own local flavor and originality. However, unlike when hip-hop first burst on the scene as a politically driven and rebellious underground movement, South Africans wanted to create a happier vibe. As the post-apartheid fog cleared, South African youth found their ""own voice in a style of music known as kwaito, spawning a new (and profitable) industry"". [ 72 ]  According to TIMEeurope magazine, ""The kwaito sound now regularly incorporates traditional African music, jazz, gospel, and even rock guitar, most notably on Mandoza's 2000 hit Nkalakatha, one of the few kwaito records to cross over onto traditionally white radio"". [ 73 ]  In the kwaito, the samples from old school  Jamaican dancehall , European house, etc.,  tempos  are changed, beats are added, and urban street slang is also incorporated. This local flavor of music more recently has been attacked for its lack of ingenuity and its betrayal of its roots. The melodies and the incorporation of sex and dance have since become very similar to the American standard. In addition Kwaito has been criticised for its absence of influential lyrical content. As Kwaito is still a developing genre, and since the South African population is only around 48 million, sales of only 25,000 CDs are required for ""gold"" certification in South Africa. [ 72 ]     Religion       Main article:  Religion in South Africa               St. Mark 's Anglican Cathedral.       According to the latest 2001 national census, Christians accounted for 79.7% of the population. This includes  Zion Christian  11.1%,  Pentecostal  ( Charismatic ) 8.2%,  Roman Catholic  7.1%,  Methodist  6.8%,  Dutch Reformed  6.7%,  Anglican  3.8%, and other Christian 36%.  Islam  accounted for 1.5% of the population,  Hinduism  about 1.3%, and  Judaism  0.2%. 15.1% had no religious affiliation, 2.3% were other and 1.4% were unspecified. [ 74 ] [ 75 ]   African Indigenous Churches were the largest of the  Christian  groups. It was believed that many of these persons who claimed no affiliation with any organised religion adhered to  traditional indigenous religions . Many peoples have  syncretic  religious practices combining Christian and indigenous influences. [ 76 ]   Islam in South Africa  itself is not known to pre-date the colonial period, despite the isolated contact neighbouring  Mozambique  had with  Arab  and  East African  traders. [ citation needed ]  There is no evidence that Islam was known to the  Zulu ,  Swazi , or  Xhosa  of the east coast prior to the colonial era. Many South African Muslims are described as  Coloureds , notably in the  Western Cape , especially those whose ancestors came as slaves from the Indonesian archipelago (the  Cape Malays ). Others are described as  Indians , notably in  KwaZulu-Natal , including those whose ancestors came as traders from  South Asia ; they have been joined by others from other parts of Africa as well as white or black South African converts. It is estimated that  Islam  is the fastest growing religion of conversion in the country, [ 77 ]  with the number of black  Muslims  growing sixfold, from 12,000 in 1991 to 74,700 in 2004. [ 78 ]   Hinduism  dates back to British Colonial period primarily but later waves of continuous immigrants from India have contributed to a sizable Hindu population. Most Hindus are ethnically South Asian but there are many who come from mixed racial stock and many are converts with the efforts of Hindu missionaries such as ISKCON. Other religions in smaller numbers are  Sikhism ,  Jainism  and  Bah' Faith . [ 75 ]     Languages       Main article:  Languages of South Africa              Map showing principal South African languages by municipality. Lighter shades indicate a non-majority  plurality .             Afrikaans          Northern Sotho          Southern Sotho          Swati          Tsonga            Tswana          Venda          Xhosa          Zulu               South Africa has eleven  official languages : [ 79 ]   Sepedi ,  Sesotho ,  Setswana ,  siSwati ,  Tshivenda ,  Xitsonga ,  Afrikaans ,  English ,  isiNdebele ,  isiXhosa  and  isiZulu . In this regard it is  second only to India  in number. While each language is formally equal to every other, some languages are spoken more than others. According to the 2001 National Census, the three most spoken first home languages are Zulu (23.8%), Xhosa (17.6%) and Afrikaans (13.3%). [ 51 ]  Despite the fact that English is recognised as the language of commerce and science, it was spoken by only 8.2% of South Africans at home in 2001, an even lower percentage than in 1996 (8.6%). [ 51 ]   There are  eleven official names  for South Africa, one in each of the official national languages. The country also recognises eight non-official languages:  Fanagalo ,  Khoe ,  Lobedu ,  Nama ,  Northern Ndebele ,  Phuthi ,  San  and  South African Sign Language . [ citation needed ]  These non-official languages may be used in certain official uses in limited areas where it has been determined that these languages are prevalent. Nevertheless, their populations are not such that they require nationwide recognition.   Many of the ""unofficial languages"" of the  San  and  Khoikhoi  people contain regional  dialects  stretching northward into Namibia and Botswana, and elsewhere. These people, who are a physically distinct population from other Africans, have their own cultural identity based on their  hunter-gatherer  societies. They have been marginalised to a great extent, and many of their languages are in danger of becoming  extinct .   Many white South Africans also speak other European languages, such as  Portuguese  (also spoken by Angolan and Mozambican blacks), German, and  Greek , while some  Asians  and  Indians  in South Africa speak  South Asian  languages, such as  Tamil ,  Hindi ,  Gujarati ,  Urdu  and  Telugu .  French  is still widely spoken by French South Africans especially in places like  Franschhoek , where many South Africans are of French origin. South African French is spoken by less than 10,000 individuals. Congolese French is also spoken in South Africa by migrants.

Other sports with significant support are  swimming ,  golf  and  netball .  Basketball ,  surfing  and  skateboarding  are popular among the youth.   Famous boxing personalities include Baby Jake  Jacob Matlala ,  Vuyani Bungu ,  Welcome Ncita ,  Dingaan Thobela ,  Gerrie Coetzee  and  Brian Mitchell . Football players who have excelled in international clubs include  Lucas Radebe  of  Leeds United  and  Quinton Fortune , formerly of  Manchester United ,  Benni McCarthy  and  Aaron Mokoena  of  Blackburn Rovers  and  Steven Pienaar  of  Everton . South Africa produced  Formula 1  motor racing's 1979 world champion  Jody Scheckter .   South Africa hosted and won the  1995 Rugby World Cup  at their first attempt and again won the  2007 Rugby World Cup  in  France . South Africa was only allowed to participate from 1995 since the end of  Apartheid . It followed the 1995 Rugby World Cup by hosting and winning the  1996 African Cup of Nations  football tournament. It also hosted the  2003 Cricket World Cup  and the  2007 World Twenty20 Championship . South Africa will be the host nation for the  2010 FIFA World Cup , which will be the first time the tournament is held on the African continent.   In 2004, the swim team of  Roland Schoeman ,  Lyndon Ferns ,  Darian Townsend  and  Ryk Neethling  won the gold medal at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, simultaneously breaking the world record in the 4x100 freestyle relay.  Penny Heyns  won Olympic Gold in the 1996  Atlanta Olympic Games .   In golf,  Gary Player  is generally regarded as one of the greatest golfers of all time, having won the  Career Grand Slam , one of five golfers to have done so. Other South African golfers to have successfully won a major tournament include  Bobby Locke ,  Ernie Els ,  Retief Goosen  and  Trevor Immelman .     Current issues     HIV/AIDS       Main article:  HIV/AIDS in South Africa       The spread of  AIDS  (acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome) is an alarming problem in South Africa with up to 31% of pregnant women found to be HIV infected in 2005 and the infection rate among adults estimated at 20%. [ 80 ]  The link between HIV, a virus spread primarily by sexual contact, and AIDS was long denied by prior president  Thabo Mbeki  and then health minister  Manto Tshabalala-Msimang , who insisted that the many deaths in the country are due to malnutrition, and hence poverty, and not HIV. [ 81 ]  In 2007, in response to international pressure, the government made efforts to fight AIDS. [ 82 ]  In September 2008 Thabo Mbeki was ousted by the ANC and  Kgalema Motlanthe  was appointed for the interim. One of Mr. Motlanthe's first actions was to replace Mrs. Tshabalala-Msimang with the current minister,  Barbara Hogan .   AIDS affects mainly those who are sexually active and is far more prevalent in the black population. Most deaths are people who are also economically active, resulting in many families losing their primary wage earners. This has resulted in many 'AIDS orphans' who in many cases depend on the state for care and financial support. [ 83 ]  It is estimated that there are 1,200,000 orphans in South Africa. [ 83 ]  Many elderly people also lose the support from lost younger members of their family. Roughly 5 million people are infected with the disease. [ 82 ]     Crime       Main article:  Crime in South Africa               Prison  buildings on  Robben Island       According to a survey for the period 19982000 compiled by the  United Nations , South Africa was ranked second for  murder  and first for  assaults  and  rapes  per capita. [ 84 ]  Total crime per capita is 10th out of the 60 countries in the data set.   Crime  has had a pronounced effect on society: many middle-class South Africans moved into  gated communities , abandoning the central business districts of some cities for the relative security of suburbs. This effect is most pronounced in  Johannesburg , although the trend is noticeable in other cities as well. [ citation needed ]  Many emigrants from South Africa also state that crime was a big motivator for them to leave.  Crime against the farming community  has continued to be a major problem. [ 85 ]     Skills migration   Along with many African nations, South Africa has been experiencing a "" brain drain "" in the past 20 years. This is believed to be potentially damaging for the regional economy, [ 86 ]  and is almost certainly detrimental for the well-being of the majority of people reliant on the healthcare infrastructure, given the HIV/AIDS epidemic. [ 87 ]  The skills drain in South Africa tends to demonstrate racial contours (naturally given the skills distribution legacy of South Africa) and has thus resulted in large white South African communities abroad. [ 88 ]     Xenophobia       Main article:  Xenophobia in South Africa       In May 2008 long standing state hostility to African migrants exploded in a series of pogroms that left up to 100 people dead and 100,000 displaced.

Located at roughly 13 North of the  equator  and 59 West of the  prime meridian , it is considered a part of the  Lesser Antilles . Its closest island neighbours are  Saint Vincent & the Grenadines  and  Saint Lucia  to the west. To the south lies  Trinidad and Tobago with which Barbados now shares a fixed official maritime boundaryand also the  South American  mainland. Barbados's total land area is about 430 square kilometres (166 square miles), and is primarily low-lying, with some higher in the country's interior. The highest point in Barbados is  Mount Hillaby  in the parish of Saint Andrew. The geological composition of Barbados is of non-volcanic origin and is predominantly composed of  limestone - coral  formed by subduction of the South American plate colliding with the Caribbean plate. The island's climate is  tropical , with constant  trade winds  off the Atlantic Ocean serving to keep temperatures mild. Some less developed areas of the country contain tropical woodland and  mangroves . Other parts of the interior which contribute to the agriculture industry are dotted with large  sugarcane  estates and wide, gently sloping  pastures , with panoramic views down to the coast also.   Barbados's  human development index  ranking is consistently among the top 75 countries in the world. For example, in 2006, it was ranked 31st in the world, and third in the Americas, behind  Canada  and the  United States .

The origin of the name ""Barbados"" is controversial. The  Portuguese , en route to  Brazil  are credited as the first Europeans to discover and name the island. It is a matter of conjecture whether the word ""bearded"" refers to the long, hanging roots of the bearded fig-tree ( Ficus citrifolia ), indigenous to the island, to bearded  Caribs  inhabiting the island, or to the foam spraying over the outlying reefs giving the impression of a beard. In 1519, a map produced by the Genoese mapmaker  Visconte Maggiolo  showed and named Barbados in its correct position southeast of the island of  Dominica .   Another name associated with Barbados or her people is ""Bim"" or ""Bimshire"". The origin is uncertain but several theories abound, the  National Cultural Foundation  of Barbados follows the Dr.  Richard Allsopp  theory, which is that ""Bim"" was a word commonly used by slaves and that it derives from the phrase ""bi mu"" [ 2 ]  or either (""bem"", ""Ndi bem"", ""Nwanyi ibem"" or ""Nwoke ibem"") [ 3 ]  from an  Igbo  phrase, meaning ""my people."" In colloquial or literary contexts, ""Bim"" can also take a more deific tone, referring to the ""goddess"" Barbados. [ citation needed ]  The word Bim and Bimshire are recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary and the Chamber's Twentieth Century Dictionaries. Another possible source for ""Bim"" is reported to be in the Agricultural Reporter of 25 April 1868, The Rev. N Greenidge (father of one of the island's most famous scholars, Abel Hendy Jones Greenidge) suggested the listing of Bimshire as a county of England. Expressly named were ""Wiltshire, Hampshire, Berkshire, and Bimshire"". [ 4 ]  Lastly in the Daily Argosy (of Demerara i.e. Guyana) of 1652 it referred to Bim as a possible corruption of the word "" Byam "", who was a Royalist leader against the Parliamentarians. That source suggested the followers of Byam became known as Bims and became a word for all Barbadians. [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Early history   The first indigenous people are thought to be  Amerindians  who arrived from  Venezuela  around approximately 350-400 B.C. The  Arawak  people were the second wave of migrants, arriving from South America around 800. In the thirteenth century, the Caribs arrived from South America in the third wave, displacing both the Arawak and the Salodoid-Barrancoid culture. For the next few centuries, the Caribs  like the Arawak and the Salodoid-Barrancoid  lived in isolation on the island.   The  Portuguese  then briefly claimed Barbados from the mid-1500s to the 1600s; and may have seized the indigenous  Caribs  on Barbados and used them as  slave labour . Other Caribs are believed to have fled the island to neighbouring islands. Apart from possibly displacing the Caribs, the Portuguese left little impact and by the 1610s, they left for South America, leaving the island uninhabited.     [ edit ]   British colonial rule   British sailors who landed on Barbados in 1625 arrived at the site of present-day  Holetown . From the arrival of the first British settlers in 16271628 until independence in 1966, Barbados was under uninterrupted British control. Nevertheless, Barbados always enjoyed a large measure of local autonomy. Its  House of Assembly  began meeting in 1639. Among the initial important British figures was Sir  William Courten .   With the increased implementation of slave codes, which created differential treatment between Africans and the white workers and planters, the island became increasingly unattractive to  poor whites . Black or slave codes were implemented in 1661, 1676, 1682, and 1688. In response to these codes, several slave rebellions were attempted or planned during this time, but none succeeded. However, an increasingly repressive legal system caused the gap between the treatment of typically white indentured servants and black slaves to widen. Imported slaves became much more attractive for the rich planters who would increasingly dominate the island not only economically but also politically. Some have speculated that, because the Africans could withstand tropical diseases and the climate much better than the white slave population, the white population decreased. This is inconsistent with the fact that many poor whites simply migrated to neighbouring islands and remained in tropical climates. Nevertheless, poor whites who had or acquired the means to emigrate often did so. Planters expanded their importation of African slaves to cultivate sugar cane. The Barbados turned from mainly English and Scots-Irish in the seventeenth century to overwhelmingly black by the end of the 18th century.   Barbados eventually had one of the world's biggest sugar industries after Jews from Brazil introduced the sugarcane to the island in the mid 1600s. This quickly replaced  tobacco  plantations on the islands which were previously the main export. As the  sugar  industry developed into its main commercial enterprise, Barbados was divided into large plantation estates that replaced the smallholdings of the early British settlers. Some of the displaced farmers moved to other British colonies in the Americas, most notably  North  and  South Carolina , and  British Guiana , as well as  Panama . To work the plantations, planters imported enslaved West Africans to Barbados and other Caribbean islands.   The British abolished the  slave trade  in 1807 but not the institution itself. In 1816, slaves arose in the largest major slave rebellion in the island's history. Twenty thousand slaves from over seventy plantations rebelled. They drove whites off the plantations, but widespread killings did not take place. This was later termed Bussa's Rebellion after the slave ranger  Bussa , who with his assistants hated slavery, found the treatment of slaves on Barbados to be intolerable, and believed the political climate in the UK made the time ripe to peacefully negotiate with planters for freedom (Davis, p. 211; Northrup, p. 191). Bussa's Rebellion failed. One hundred and twenty slaves died in combat or were immediately executed; another 144 were brought to trial and executed; remaining rebels were shipped off the island (Davis, pp. 212-213).   Slavery was finally abolished in the British Empire eighteen years later in 1834. In Barbados and the rest of the British West Indian colonies, full emancipation from slavery was preceded by an apprenticeship period that lasted four years.          Statue of  Lord Nelson  in  National Heroes Square  which predates the more famous  Nelson's Column  by some 27 years.       In 1884, the Barbados Agricultural Society sent a letter to  Sir Francis Hincks  requesting his private and public views on whether the Dominion of Canada would favourably entertain having the then colony of Barbados admitted as a member of the Canadian Confederation. Asked of  Canada  were the terms of the Canadian side to initiate discussions, and whether or not the island of Barbados could depend on the full influence of Canada in getting the change agreed to by the  United Kingdom . Then in 1952 the  Barbados Advocate  newspaper polled several prominent Barbadian politicians, lawyers, businessmen, the Speaker of the  Barbados House of Assembly  and later as first President of the  Senate , Sir Theodore Branker , Q.C. and found them to be in favour of immediate federation of Barbados along with the rest of the British  Caribbean  with complete Dominion Status within five years from the date of inauguration of the  West Indies Federation  with Canada.   However, plantation owners and merchants of British descent still dominated local politics, owing to the high income qualification required for voting. More than 70% of the population, many of them disenfranchised women, were excluded from the democratic process. It was not until the 1930s that the descendants of emancipated slaves began a movement for political rights. One of the leaders of this movement,  Sir Grantley Adams , founded the  Barbados Labour Party  in 1938, then known as the Barbados Progressive League. While being a staunch supporter of the monarchy, Adams and his party also demanded more rights for the poor and for the people. Progress toward a more democratic government in Barbados was made in 1942, when the exclusive income qualification was lowered and women were given the right to vote. By 1949 governmental control was wrested from the planters and, in 1958, Adams became Premier of Barbados.   From 1958 to 1962, Barbados was one of the ten members of the  West Indies Federation , an organisation doomed by nationalistic attitudes and by the fact that its members, as British colonies, held limited legislative power. Adams served as its first and only ""Premier"", but his leadership failed in attempts to form similar unions, and his continued defence of the monarchy was used by his opponents as evidence that he was no longer in touch with the needs of his country.  Errol Walton Barrow , a fervent reformer, became the new people's advocate. Barrow had left the BLP and formed the  Democratic Labour Party  as a liberal alternative to Adams' conservative government. Barrow instituted many progressive social programmes, such as free education for all Barbadians, and the School Meals system. By 1961, Barrow had replaced Adams as Premier and the DLP controlled the government.   With the Federation dissolved, Barbados had reverted to its former status, that of a  self-governing colony . The island negotiated its own independence at a constitutional conference with the United Kingdom in June 1966. After years of peaceful and democratic progress, Barbados finally became an independent state on 30 November 1966, with Errol Barrow its first Prime Minister. Upon independence Barbados maintained historical linkages with Britain by establishing membership to the  Commonwealth of Nations  grouping, a year later Barbados' International linkages were expanded by obtaining membership to the  United Nations  and the  Organization of American States .     [ edit ]   Government and politics          Parliamentary building.       Main articles:  Politics of Barbados  and  Monarchy of Barbados   Barbados has been an independent country since 30 November 1966. It functions as a  constitutional monarchy  and  parliamentary democracy , modeled on the British  Westminster system , with  Elizabeth II ,  Queen of Barbados , as  head of state  represented locally by the  Governor-General ,  Clifford Husbands  and the  Prime Minister  as the  head of the government . Its  Parliament  comprises thirty seats. It has been proposed that Barbados become a  republic  with a  president  replacing the  Barbadian sovereign ; this issue is still being debated, as the island has been stable and governmentally autonomous for decades.   Barbados is a full and participating member of the  Caribbean Community  (CARICOM), the  Caribbean (CARICOM) Single Market and Economy  (CSME), the  Caribbean Court of Justice  (CCJ), which pertains only to Barbados and  Guyana  but is expected to replace the UK  Privy Council  for the entire English-speaking Caribbean eventually, and the  Association of Caribbean States  (ACS). [ 6 ]   Barbados has a two party system, the two dominant parties being the ruling  Democratic Labour Party  and the  Barbados Labour Party . The Barbados Labour Party (BLP) had been in government for fifteen years, since 1993 until the 2008 general election. Under this administration, the Former Prime Minister, The Right Honourable Owen S. Arthur also acted as the Regional Leader of the CSM (Caribbean Single Market). The Right Honorable David Thompson is the Prime Minister of Barbados. [ 7 ]   On 11 April 2006, the 5-Member  UNCLOS  Annex VII Arbitral Tribunal, presided over by H.E. Judge  Stephen M. Schwebel , rendered after two years of international judicial proceedings, the landmark Barbados/Trinidad and Tobago Award, which resolved the maritime boundary delimitation (in the East, Central and West sectors) to satisfaction of both Parties and committed Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago to resolve their fisheries dispute by means of concluding a new Fisheries Agreement.     [ edit ]   Geography and climate of Barbados   Main article:  Geography and climate of Barbados          Map of Barbados              Beach near  Bridgetown , Barbados.       Barbados is extremely small for a Caribbean island. Relatively flat, it rises gently to the central highland region, the highest point being  Mount Hillaby , in the Scotland District, at 340 meters (1,100 ft) above sea level. The island is located in the Atlantic Ocean, to the east of the other Caribbean islands. The  climate  is tropical, with a rainy season from June to October.   Barbados is often spared the worst effects of the region's tropical storms and  hurricanes  during the rainy season as its far eastern location in the Atlantic Ocean puts it just outside the principal hurricane strike zone, and a hurricane hits about every 26 years. The last significant hit from a hurricane to cause severe damage to Barbados was  Hurricane Janet  in 1955.   In the parish of  Saint Michael  lies Barbados' capital and main city,  Bridgetown . Locally Bridgetown is sometimes referred to as ""The City"", but the most common reference is simply ""Town"". Other towns scattered across the island include  Holetown , in the parish of  Saint James ;  Oistins , in the parish of  Christ Church , and Speightstown, in the parish of  Saint Peter .   It is geologically composed of coral (90 m/300 ft thick). The land falls in a series of ""terraces"" in the west and goes into an incline in the east. Most of Barbados is circled by coral reefs.   The climate is moderate tropical with two seasons: dry and wet. The dry season (DecemberMay) and wet season (JuneNovember) gives an annual rainfall of 40-90 inches (1,0002,300 mm).   In February, 2009 members of the private real estate industry in Barbados have been proposing the creation of 2 small artificial islands to be anchored off the west coast of Barbados. According Paul Altman of Altman Realty the envisioned plan, would consist of a 250 acres in size island that would house new tourism based developments. The second island would be 50 acres in size and would serve as a national park. Both islands would be a short distance from the  Deep Water Harbour  in Bridgetown. [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Parishes   Main article:  Parishes of Barbados          Map of the parishes of Barbados       Barbados is  divided  into eleven administrative  parishes :     Christ Church   Saint Andrew   Saint George   Saint James   Saint John   Saint Joseph   Saint Lucy   Saint Michael   Saint Peter   Saint Philip   Saint Thomas       [ edit ]   Economy   Main article:  Economy of Barbados   Historically, the economy of Barbados had been dependent on  sugarcane  cultivation and related activities, but in recent years it has diversified into the  manufacturing  and  tourism  sectors. Offshore finance and information services have become important foreign exchange earners, and there is a healthy light manufacturing sector. In recent years the Government has been seen as business-friendly and economically sound. Since the late 1990s the island has seen a construction boom, with the development and redevelopment of hotels, office complexes, and homes.   The government continues its efforts to reduce  unemployment , encourage direct foreign investment, and privatize remaining state-owned enterprises. Unemployment has been reduced from around 14 percent in the past to under 10 percent.          Circulating  coins  2006       The economy contracted in 2001 and 2002 due to slowdowns in tourism, consumer spending and the impact of the  September 11, 2001 attacks , but rebounded in 2003 and has shown growth since 2004. Traditional trading partners include Canada, the  Caribbean Community  (especially  Trinidad and Tobago ), the United Kingdom and the United States.   Business links and investment flows have become substantial: as of 2003 the island saw from Canada  CA$  25 billion in investment holdings, placing it as one of Canada's top five destinations for Canadian  Foreign Direct Investment  (FDI). Businessman  Eugene Melnyk  of  Toronto , Canada, is said to be Barbados' richest permanent resident.   It was thought by key Barbadian industry sources that the year 2006 would have been one of the busiest years for building construction ever in Barbados, as the building-boom on the island entered the final stages for several multi-million dollar projects. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Transport   Main article:  Transport in Barbados   Transport on the island is good, with 'route taxis', called ""ZR's"" (pronounced "" Zed -Rs"" not ""Zee-Rs""), travelling to most points on the island. These small buses can at times be crowded, as passengers are generally never turned down, regardless of the number. However, they will usually take the more scenic routes to destinations. They generally depart from the capital  Bridgetown  or from  Speightstown  in the northern part of the island.          A  Mini Moke  at  Speightstown  beach       The island of Barbados's lone airport is the  Sir Grantley Adams International Airport (GAIA)  ( IATA  identifier  BGI ). It receives daily flights by several major airlines from points around the globe, as well as several smaller regional commercial airlines and charters. The airport serves as the main air-transportation hub for the Eastern Caribbean. It is undergoing a US$100 million upgrade and expansion.   There are three bus systems running seven days a week (though less frequently on Sundays), and a ride on any of them costs $1.50 BBD. The smaller buses from the two privately-owned systems (""ZRs"" and ""minibuses"") can give change; the larger blue and yellow buses from the government-operated  Barbados Transport Board  system cannot. Most routes require a connection in Bridgetown. Some drivers within the competitive privately owned systems are reluctant to advise persons to use competing services, even if those would be more suitable.   Some hotels also provide visitors with shuttles to points of interest on the island from outside the hotel lobby. There are several locally-owned and -operated vehicle rental agencies in Barbados but there are no multi-national car-rental agencies such as Avis, Europcar or Hertz.   There is also a helicopter shuttle service, which offers air taxi services to a number of sites around the island, mainly on the West Coast tourist belt. Air and water traffic is regulated by the  Barbados Port Authority .     [ edit ]   Tourist information   The island is well developed, and there are internationally known hotels offering world-class accommodation. Time-shares are available, and many of the smaller local hotels and private villas which dot the island have space available if booked in advance. The southern and western coasts of Barbados are popular, with the calm light blue Atlantic Ocean and their fine white and pinkish sandy beaches. Along the island's east coast the Atlantic Ocean side are tumbling waves which are perfect for light  surfing , but a little bit risky due to under-tow currents.   Shopping  districts are popular in Barbados, with ample duty-free shopping. There is also a festive night-life in mainly tourist areas such as the  Saint Lawrence Gap . Other attractions include wildlife reserves, jewellery stores,  scuba diving , helicopter rides,  golf ,  festivals  (the largest being the annual crop over festival July/Aug), sightseeing, cave exploration, exotic  drinks  and fine  clothes   shopping .     [ edit ]   Attractions, landmarks and points of interest   Tourism accounts for almost one half of the economy.

Close to 90% of all Barbadians (also known colloquially as  Bajan ) are of  African  descent (""Afro-Bajans""). A mix of many African ethnicities, notably the  Igbo ,  Akan  and  Yoruba people , they are mostly descendants of the  slave  labourers on the sugar plantations. The remainder of the population includes groups of Europeans (""Anglo-Bajans"" / ""Euro-Bajans"") mainly from the  United Kingdom , the  Republic of Ireland , Chinese locally known as Bajan-Chiney, Bajan Hindus from  India  and Muslims from  Bangladesh  and  Pakistan , and an influential ""Arab-Bajans"" group mainly of Christian  Syrians  and  Lebanese  descent. On the island are many people of  Creole  descent, a mixture of Afro-Caribbean and European descent (Primarily British, Irish and  Portuguese ).   Other groups in Barbados include people from the  United Kingdom ,  United States  and  Canada . Barbadians who return after years of residence in the U.S. are called ""Bajan Yankees""; this term is considered derogatory by some.   The country's official language is English, the local dialect of which is referred to as  Bajan , spoken by most. In religion, most Barbadians are  Christians  (67%), chiefly of the  Anglican Church , but there are Protestant,  Roman Catholic ,  Jehovah's Witness ,  Hindu ,  Muslim  and  Jewish  minorities. Barbados is a chief destination for emigrants from the South American nation of  Guyana . The biggest communities outside the Afro-Caribbean community are:     The  Indo-Guyanese , an important part of the economy due to the increase of immigrants from partner country  Guyana . There are reports of a growing Indo-Bajan diaspora originating from Guyana and  India . They introduced soca-chutney ,  roti  and many Indian dishes to Barbados' culture. Mostly from southern India and Hindu states, these 'Desi' peoples are growing in size but smaller than the equivalent communities in Trinidad & Guyana; Hinduism is one of Barbados' growing religions.   Euro-Bajans (4% of the population) [ 10 ]  have settled in Barbados since the 1500s, originating from  England , Portugal, Ireland and  Scotland . In 1643, there were 37,200 whites in Barbados (86% of the population). [ 11 ]  More commonly they are known as "" White Bajans "", although some carry Afro-Caribbean traces and vice-versa. Euro-Bajans introduced folk music, such as  Irish music  and Highland music, and certain place names, such as ""Scotland"", a mountainous region, and ""Trafalgar Square"" in Bridgetown, now renamed ""Heroes Square"". Among White Barbadians there exists an underclass known as  Redlegs ; the descendants of  indentured servants , and prisoners imported to the island. [ 12 ]   Chinese -Barbadians (or, as they are known on the island, ""Bajan-Chineys"") are a small portion of Barbados' Asian demographics, smaller than the equivalent communities of  Jamaica  and  Trinidad . Most if not all first arrived in the 1940s during the Second World War, originating mainly from the then British territory of  Hong Kong . Many Chinese-Bajans have the surnames Chin, Chynn or Lee, although other surnames prevail in certain areas of the island. Chinese food and culture is becoming part of everyday Bajan culture.   Lebanese and Syrians form the Middle Eastern community on the island and make up 89% of the Muslim population. Middle-Eastern Barbadians are often perceived to be the most successful group in business, along with the Chinese Bajans. During the  Arab Israeli Wars , many Syrians and Lebanese headed for the West Indies to escape conflict and poverty in the  Middle East . [ citation needed ]  Also Jewish people arrived in Barbados around the same time, creating the biggest synagogue in the West Indies.   Latin Americans have been migrating to the island since the 18th century, due to the close proximity of  South America , many  Venezuelans  had migrated to Barbados as labourers via Trinidad.  Brazilian Jews ,  Colombians  and  Panamanians  also live on the island. The Spanish language is now being encouraged to be taught as a second language in Barbadian schools over French.       [ edit ]   Culture          Banks beer at dusk       Main article:  Culture of Barbados   See also:  Music of Barbados   The influence of the English on Barbados is more noticeable than on other islands in the West Indies. A good example of this is the island's national sport:  cricket . Barbados has brought forth several great cricketers, including  Garfield Sobers  and  Frank Worrell .   Citizens are officially called Barbadians; Barbados' residents, however, colloquially refer to themselves or the products of the country as ""Bajan"". The term ""Bajan"" may have come from a localized pronunciation of the word Barbadian which at times can sound more like ""Bar-bajan"".   The largest  carnival -like cultural event which takes place on the island is the  Crop Over  festival. As in many other Caribbean and Latin American countries,  Crop Over  is an important event for many people on the island, as well as the thousands of tourists that flock to the island to participate in the annual events. The festival includes musical competitions and other traditional activities. It gets under way from the beginning of July, and ends with the costumed parade on Kadooment Day, held on the first Monday of August.   Barbados retains a strong British influence and is referred to by its neighbours as ""Little England"".     [ edit ]   Sports in Barbados   See also:  Cricket in the West Indies   As in other Caribbean countries of British descent,  cricket  is a favourite sport. In addition to several warm-up matches and six ""Super Eight"" matches, Barbados hosted the final of the  2007 Cricket World Cup .   In  golf , the  Barbados Open  is an annual stop on the  European Seniors Tour . In December 2006 the  WGC-World Cup  took place at the country's  Sandy Lane  resort on the Country Club course, an eighteen-hole course designed by  Tom Fazio .   Motorsports also play a role, with Rally Barbados occurring each summer and currently being listed on the FIA NACAM calendar.   Basketball  is a popular sport played at school or college and is increasing in popularity as is  volleyball , though volleyball is mainly played inside. At certain beaches such as Brandons beach in St. Michael people do get together to play  beach volleyball .   Other sports played include  hockey ,  table tennis ,  road tennis ,  football ,  rugby ,  polo  and  swimming .   Netball  is also popular with women in Barbados.     [ edit ]   National symbols     [ edit ]   Flower          A yellow and red Pride of Barbados ( Caesalpinia pulcherrima ).       The national flower is the Pride of Barbados or  Caesalpinia pulcherrima  (L.) Sw., which grows across the island.     [ edit ]   Flag   The tridented centered within the flag is a representation of the mythological  Neptune , god of the sea. The trident in its original unbroken form was taken from the former colonial seal, which itself was replaced by the current coat of arms. Used within the national flag, the left and right shafts of the trident were then designed as 'broken' representing the nation of Barbados breaking away from its historical and constitutional ties as a former colony.   The three points of the  trident  represent in Barbados the three principles of  democracy  - ""government of, for and by the people."" The broken trident is set in a centered vertical band of gold representing the sands of Barbados' beaches. The gold band itself is surrounded on both sides by vertical bands of ultramarine (blue) representing the sea and sky of Barbados.   The design for the flag was created by Grantley W. Prescod and was chosen from an open competition arranged by the Barbados government. Over a thousand entries were received. [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   Golden Shield   The Golden Shield in the coat of arms carries two "" Pride of Barbados "" flowers and the ""bearded"" fig tree ( Ficus citrifolia  or  Ficus barbata ), which was common on the island at the time of its settlement by the British and may have contributed to Barbados being so named.     [ edit ]   Coat of arms   The  coat of arms  depicts two animals which are supporting the shield. On the left is a "" dolphin fish "", symbolic of the fishing industry and seagoing past of Barbados. On the right is a  pelican , symbolic of a small island named  Pelican Island  that once existed off the coast of Bridgetown. Above the shield is the helmet of Barbados with an extended arm clutching two  sugar-cane  stalks. The ""cross"" formation made by the cane stalks represents the saltire cross upon which  Saint Andrew  was crucified. On the base of the Coat of Arms reads ""Pride and Industry"" in reference to the country's motto.     [ edit ]   National heroes   Main article:  Barbadian national heroes   On April 1998, the Order of National Heroes Act was passed by the  Parliament of Barbados . According to the government, the act established that 28 April (the centenary of the birth of Sir Grantley Adams) would be celebrated as  National Heroes' Day . The act also declared that there are ten national heroes of Barbados. All of which would be elevated to the title of the The Right Excellent. [ 14 ]   The ten official National Heroes of Barbados are:-     Bussa  ( - 1816)   Sarah Ann Gill  (1795 - 1866)   Samuel Jackman Prescod  (1806 - 1871)   Dr. Charles Duncan ONeal  (1879 - 1936)   Clement Osbourne Payne  (1904 - 1941)   Sir Grantley Herbert Adams  (1898 - 1987)   Rt.

The South African coast stretches 2,798 kilometres (1,739 mi) [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  and borders both the  Atlantic  and  Indian   oceans . [ 7 ]  To the north of South Africa lie  Namibia ,  Botswana ,  Zimbabwe ,  Mozambique  and  Swaziland , while the  Kingdom of Lesotho  is an independent  enclave  surrounded by South African territory. [ 8 ]   Modern human beings have inhabited South Africa for more than 100,000 years. [ 9 ]  A century and a half after the discovery of the  Cape Sea Route , the  Dutch East India Company   founded  a refreshment station at what would become  Cape Town  in 1652. [ 10 ]  Cape Town became a British colony in 1806. European settlement expanded during the 1820s as the  Boers  (original  Dutch ,  Flemish ,  German  and  French  settlers) and the British  1820 Settlers  claimed land in the north and east of the country. Conflicts arose among the Xhosa, Zulu and Afrikaner groups. However, the discovery of diamonds and later gold triggered the conflict known as the  Anglo-Boer War  as the Boers and the British fought for the control of the South African mineral wealth. Although the Boers were defeated, limited independence was given to South Africa in 1910 as a British dominion. Anti-British policies focused on ultimate independence which was achieved in 1961 when South Africa was declared a  republic . The leading  National Party  legislated for a continuation of racial segregation begun under Dutch and British colonial rule, Boer republics, and subsequent South African governments (and which in 1948 became legally institutionalized  segregation  known as  apartheid ), despite opposition both in and outside of the country. In 1990 the then president  F.W. de Klerk  began to dismantle this legislation, and in 1994 the first democratic election was held in South Africa. This election brought  Nelson Mandela  and the current ruling party, the  African National Congress  to power, and the country rejoined the  Commonwealth of Nations .   South Africa is known for its diversity in cultures, languages, and religious beliefs, and eleven official languages are recognised in its  constitution . [ 7 ]  English is the most commonly spoken language in official and commercial public life, however it is only the fifth most spoken home language. [ 7 ]  South Africa is ethnically diverse, with the largest  Caucasian ,  Indian , and  racially mixed  communities in Africa. Although 79.6% of the South African population is  Black , [ 2 ]  this category is neither culturally nor linguistically homogenous, as people within this classification speak a number of different  Bantu languages , nine of which have official status. [ 7 ]  Midyear 2007, the South African population was estimated at 47.9 million.

(September 2008)           Main article:  History of South Africa       South Africa contains some of the oldest archaeological sites in the world. [ 11 ]   [ 12 ]  Extensive fossil remains at the  Sterkfontein ,  Kromdraai  and Makapansgat caves suggest that various  australopithecines  existed in South Africa from about three million years ago. [ 13 ]  These were succeeded by various species of  Homo , including  Homo habilis ,  Homo erectus  and modern humans,  Homo sapiens . Settlements of  Bantu -speaking peoples, who were  iron -using agriculturists and herdsmen, were already present south of the  Limpopo River  by the fourth or fifth century (see  Bantu expansion ) displacing and absorbing the original  KhoiSan  speakers. They slowly moved south and the earliest ironworks in modern-day  KwaZulu-Natal Province  are believed to date from around 1050. The southernmost group was the  Xhosa  people, whose language incorporates certain linguistic traits from the earlier KhoiSan people, reaching the  Fish River , in today's  Eastern Cape Province . These  Iron Age  populations displaced earlier people, who often had  hunter-gatherer  societies, as they migrated.     European colonisation          Painting of an account of the arrival of  Jan van Riebeeck , the first  European  to settle in South Africa, with  Devil's Peak  in the background       In 1487, the  Portuguese  explorer  Bartolomeu Dias  became the first European to reach the southernmost point of Africa. Initially named The Cape of Storms, The King of Portugal,  John II , renamed it the  Cabo da Boa Esperana  or  Cape of Good Hope  as it led to the riches of India. This great feat of navigation was later immortalized in  Cames ' epic Portuguese poem,  The Lusiads  (1572). In 1652, a refreshment station was established at the  Cape of Good Hope  by  Jan van Riebeeck  on behalf of the  Dutch East India Company .  Slaves  were brought from  Indonesia ,  Madagascar , and India as a labour source for the Dutch immigrants in  Cape Town . As they expanded east, the Dutch settlers eventually met the south-westerly expanding  Xhosa  people in the region of the  Fish River . A series of wars, called the  Cape Frontier Wars , ensued, mainly caused by conflicting land and livestock interests.   Great Britain  took over the  Cape of Good Hope  area in 1795 ostensibly to stop it falling into the hands of the Revolutionary French, but also seeking to use  Cape Town  in particular as a stop on the route to Australia and India. It was later returned to the Dutch in 1803, but soon afterwards the  Dutch East India Company  declared bankruptcy, and the British annexed the Cape Colony in 1806. The British continued the frontier wars against the Xhosa, pushing the eastern frontier eastward through a line of forts established along the Fish River and consolidating it by encouraging  British settlement . Due to pressure of  abolitionist  societies in Britain, the  British parliament  first stopped its global  slave trade  with the passage of the  Slave Trade Act 1807 , then abolished slavery in all its colonies with the  Slavery Abolition Act 1833 . During the 1830s, approximately 12 000  Boers  (later known as  Voortrekkers ), departed from the  Cape Colony , where they were subjected to British control, to the future Natal, Orange Free State and Transvaal regions. The Boers founded the  Boer Republics  - the  South African Republic  (Now  Gauteng ,  Limpopo ,  Mpumalanga  and  North West  provinces) and the  Orange Free State  ( Free State ).   The discovery of  diamonds  in 1867 and  gold  in 1884 in the interior encouraged economic growth and immigration, intensifying the subjugation of the indigenous people. These important economic resources did not only play a role between European and the indigenous population but also between the Boers and the British. [ 14 ]   The  Boer Republics  successfully resisted British encroachments during the  First Boer War  (18801881) using  guerrilla warfare  tactics, much better suited to local conditions. However, the British returned in greater numbers, more experience, and more suitable tactics in the  Second Boer War  (18991902). The Boers' attempt to ally themselves with  German South-West Africa  provided the British with yet another excuse to take control of the Boer Republics. [ citation needed ]           Boers  in combat (1881).         Independence   After four years of negotiating, the  Union of South Africa  was created from the  Cape  and  Natal  colonies, as well as the republics of  Orange Free State  and  Transvaal , on 31 May 1910, exactly eight years after the end of the Second Boer War. The newly created Union of South Africa was a  dominion . The  Natives' Land Act  of 1913 severely restricted the ownership of land by 'blacks', at that stage to a mere 7% of the country, although this amount was eventually increased marginally. [ 15 ]  The union was effectively granted independence from the United Kingdom with the passage of the  Statute of Westminster , which morphed the  British king's  position within South Africa into that of the distinct  King of South Africa . In 1934, the  South African Party  and  National Party  merged to form the  United Party , seeking reconciliation between Afrikaners and English-speaking ""Whites"", but split in 1939 over the entry of the Union into  World War II  as an ally of the United Kingdom, a move which the National Party strongly opposed.   In 1948, the  National Party  was elected to power, and intensified the implementation of racial segregation that had begun under Dutch and British colonial rule, and subsequent South African governments since the Union was formed. The Nationalist Government systematised existing segregationist laws, and the system of segregation became known collectively as  apartheid . Not surprisingly, this segregation also applied to the wealth acquired during rapid industrialisation of the 1950s, '60s, and '70s. While the White minority enjoyed the highest  standard of living  in all of Africa, often comparable to  First World  western nations, the Black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard, including income, education, housing, and life expectancy. On 31 May 1961, following a whites-only  referendum , the country became a  republic  and left the (British)  Commonwealth . The office of  Governor-General  was abolished and replaced with the position of  State President .   Apartheid became increasingly controversial, leading to widespread  sanctions ,  divestment  and growing unrest and oppression within South Africa. (See also the article on the  History of South Africa in the apartheid era .) A long period of harsh suppression by the government, and at times violent resistance,  strikes , marches, protests, and  sabotage  by bombing and other means, by various anti-apartheid movements, most notably the  African National Congress  (ANC), followed. In the late 1970s, South Africa began a programme of  nuclear weapons  development and in the following decade it produced six deliverable nuclear weapons. The rationale for the nuclear arsenal is disputed, but it is believed [ who? ]  that  Vorster  and  P.W. Botha  wanted to be able to catalyse American intervention in the event of a war between South Africa and the  Cuban -supported  MPLA  government of  Angola .     Democracy   In 1990 the  National Party  government took the first step towards negotiating itself out of power when it lifted the ban on the  African National Congress  and other  left-wing  political organisations, and released  Nelson Mandela  from prison after twenty-seven years' incarceration on a  sabotage  sentence. Apartheid legislation was gradually removed from the statute books, and South Africa also destroyed its nuclear arsenal and acceded to the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . The first  multi-racial elections  were held in 1994, which the ANC won by an overwhelming majority. It has been in power ever since.   In  post-apartheid South Africa , millions of South Africans, mostly black, continued to live in  poverty , though poverty among whites, previously rare, has increased greatly. [ 16 ]  While some have partly attributed this to the legacy of the apartheid system, increasingly many attribute it to the failure of the current government to tackle social issues, coupled with the monetary and fiscal discipline of the current government to ensure both redistribution of wealth and economic growth. Since the ANC-led government took power, the  United Nations   Human Development Index  of South Africa has fallen, while it was steadily rising until the mid-1990s. [ 17 ]  Some of this could possibly be attributed to the  AIDS   pandemic  and the failure of the government to take steps to address it, [ 18 ] some of it can also be pinpointed to a government policy of  redistribution of wealth . As a mitigating factor, the social housing policy of the current government has produced an improvement in living conditions.     Politics       Main articles:  Politics of South Africa ,  Government of South Africa , and  Law of South Africa              The  Union Buildings  in  Pretoria  is the home of the South African executive.       South Africa has three capital cities:  Cape Town , the largest of the three, is the  legislative  capital;  Pretoria  is the  administrative  capital; and  Bloemfontein  is the  judicial  capital. South Africa has a  bicameral   parliament : the  National Council of Provinces  (the  upper house ) has 90 members, while the  National Assembly  (the  lower house ) has 400 members. Members of the lower house are elected on a population basis by  proportional representation : half of the members are elected from national lists and the other half are elected from provincial lists. Ten members are elected to represent each province in the National Council of Provinces, regardless of the population of the province. Elections for both chambers are held every five years. The government is formed in the lower house, and the leader of the majority party in the National Assembly is the  President .   The primary sources of South Africa law are Roman-Dutch mercantile law and personal law with English Common law, as imports of Dutch settlements and  British colonialism . [ 19 ]  The first European based law in South Africa was brought by the  Dutch East India Company  and is called  Roman-Dutch law . It was imported before the  codification  of European law into the  Napoleonic Code  and is comparable in many ways to  Scots law . This was followed in the 19th century by  English law , both  common  and  statutory . Starting in 1910 with unification, South Africa had its own  parliament  which passed laws specific for South Africa, building on those previously passed for the individual member colonies.   Current South African politics are dominated by the  African National Congress  (ANC), which received 69.7% of the vote during the last  2004 general election  and 66.3% of the vote in the  2006 municipal election . The current  President of South Africa  is  Kgalema Motlanthe , who replaced  Thabo Mbeki  on 25 September 2008. Mbeki succeeded former President  Nelson Mandela  in 1999, and was re-elected for a second five year term in 2004, but announced his resignation on 20 September 2008.   The main challenger to the rule of the ANC is the  Democratic Alliance  party, which received 12.4% of the vote in the 2004 election and 14.8% in the 2006 election.  Helen Zille , (elected 6 May 2007), is the party leader; the previous leader was  Tony Leon . The formerly dominant  New National Party , which introduced apartheid through its predecessor, the  National Party , chose to merge with the ANC on 9 April 2005. Other major political parties represented in Parliament are the  Inkatha Freedom Party , which mainly represents  Zulu  voters, and the  Independent Democrats , who took 6.97% and 1.7% of the vote respectively, in the 2004 election.   Since 2004, the country has had many thousands of popular protests, some violent, making it, according to one academic, the ""most protest-rich country in the world"". [ 20 ]  Many of these protests have been organised from the growing  shanty towns  that surround South African cities.     Foreign relations and military       Main articles:  South African National Defence Force ,  Foreign relations of South Africa , and  South Africa and weapons of mass destruction       Since the end of apartheid, the South African foreign policy has focused on its African partners particularly in the  Southern African Development Community  (SADC) and the  African Union . South Africa has played a key role as a mediator in African conflicts over the last decade, such as in  Burundi , the  Democratic Republic of Congo , the  Comoros , and  Zimbabwe . After apartheid ended, South Africa was readmitted to the  Commonwealth of Nations . As the  Union of South Africa , South Africa was a founding member of the  United Nations  and the then Prime Minister  Jan Smuts  wrote the preamble to its constitution. South Africa is currently a non-permanent member of the  United Nations Security Council  and has attracted controversy by voting against a resolution criticising the  Burmese  government in 2006 and against the implementation of sanctions against  Zimbabwe  in 2008. South Africa is a member of the  Group of 77  and chaired the organisation in 2006. South Africa is a member of the  South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone ,  Southern African Customs Union ,  World Trade Organization ,  International Monetary Fund ,  G20  and  G8+5 .   The South African  armed forces , known as the  South African National Defence Force  (SANDF), was created in 1994. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  Previously known as the  South African Defence Force  (SADF), the new force is an all volunteer army and consists of the forces of the old SADF, as well as the forces of the African nationalist groups, namely  Umkhonto we Sizwe  (MK),  Azanian People's Liberation Army  (APLA), and the former  Bantustan  defence forces. [ 21 ]  The SANDF is subdivided into four branches, the  South African Army , the  South African Air Force , the  South African Navy , and the  South African Military Health Services . [ 23 ]   In recent years, the SANDF has become a major  peacekeeping  force in Africa, [ 24 ]  and has been involved in operations in  Lesotho , the  Democratic Republic of the Congo , [ 24 ]  and  Burundi , [ 24 ]  amongst others. It has also participated as a part of multi-national  UN  peacekeeping forces.   South Africa undertook a nuclear weapons programme in the 1970s [ 25 ]  and  may have conducted  a nuclear test over the  Atlantic  in 1979. [ 26 ]  It is the only African country to have successfully  developed nuclear weapons . It has become the first country (followed by Ukraine) with nuclear capability to voluntarily renounce and dismantle its programme and in the process signed the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty  in 1991. [ 25 ]     Provinces, districts and municipalities       Main articles:  Provinces of South Africa ,  Districts of South Africa , and  Municipalities of South Africa              Map showing the provinces and districts (numbered) of South Africa.             Northern Cape          North West          Gauteng          Limpopo          Mpumalanga            KwaZulu-Natal          Eastern Cape          Free State          Western Cape               When apartheid ended in 1994, the South African government had to integrate the formerly independent and semi-independent  Bantustans  into the political structure of South Africa. To this end, it abolished the four former provinces of South Africa ( Cape Province ,  Natal ,  Orange Free State , and  Transvaal ) and replaced them with nine fully integrated provinces. The new provinces are usually much smaller than the former provinces, which theoretically gives local governments more resources to distribute over smaller areas.   The nine provinces are further subdivided into  52 districts :  6 metropolitan  and  46 district municipalities . The 46 district municipalities are further subdivided into  231 local municipalities . The district municipalities also contain 20 district management areas (mostly game parks) that are directly governed by the district municipalities. The six metropolitan municipalities perform the functions of both district and local municipalities.

At 470,979  sq mi  (1,219,912 km), [ 27 ]  South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world (after  Mali ). It is comparable in size to  Colombia .  Njesuthi  in the  Drakensberg  at 3,408 m (11,424 ft) is the highest peak in South Africa.          View of the  Drakensberg mountains , the highest mountain range in South Africa.       South Africa has a generally  temperate climate , due in part to it being surrounded by the  Atlantic  and  Indian Oceans  on three sides, by its location in the climatically milder  southern hemisphere  and due to the average elevation rising steadily towards the north (towards the  equator ) and further inland. Due to this varied topography and oceanic influence, a great variety of climatic zones exist.   The climatic zones vary, from the extreme  desert  of the southern  Namib  in the farthest northwest to the lush  subtropical  climate in the east along the  Mozambique  border and the  Indian  ocean. From the east, the land quickly rises over a  mountainous   escarpment  towards the interior  plateau  known as the  Highveld . Even though South Africa is classified as  semi-arid , there is considerable variation in  climate  as well as  topography .   The interior of South Africa is a vast, rather flat, and sparsely populated  scrubland ,  Karoo , which is drier towards the northwest along the Namib desert. In contrast, the eastern coastline is lush and well-watered, which produces a climate similar to the tropics. The extreme southwest has a climate remarkably similar to that of the  Mediterranean  with wet winters and hot, dry summers, hosting the famous  Fynbos   Biome . This area also produces much of the  wine  in South Africa. This region is also particularly known for its wind, which blows intermittently almost all year. The severity of this wind made passing around the  Cape of Good Hope  particularly treacherous for sailors, causing many  shipwrecks . Further east on the south coast, rainfall is distributed more evenly throughout the year, producing a green landscape. This area is popularly known as the  Garden Route .          Satellite picture of South Africa       The  Free State  is particularly flat due to the fact that it lies centrally on the high plateau. North of the  Vaal River , the Highveld becomes better watered and does not experience subtropical extremes of heat.  Johannesburg , in the centre of the Highveld, is at 1,740 metres (5,709 ft) and receives an annual rainfall of 760 millimetres (30  in ). Winters in this region are cold, although  snow  is rare.   To the north of Johannesburg, the altitude drops beyond the escarpment of the Highveld, and turns into the lower lying Bushveld, an area of mixed dry forest and an abundance of wildlife. East of the Highveld, beyond the eastern escarpment, the Lowveld stretches towards the  Indian  ocean. It has particularly high temperatures, and is also the location of extended subtropical agriculture.   The high  Drakensberg mountains , which form the south-eastern escarpment of the Highveld, offer limited  skiing  opportunities in winter. The coldest place in South Africa is  Sutherland  in the western  Roggeveld Mountains , where midwinter temperatures can reach as low as 15 degrees  Celsius  (5  F ). The deep interior has the hottest temperatures: A temperature of 51.7 C (125 F) was recorded in 1948 in the  Northern Cape  Kalahari near  Upington . [ 28 ]   South Africa also has one possession, the small sub-Antarctic archipelago of the  Prince Edward Islands , consisting of  Marion Island  (290 km/112 sq mi) and Prince Edward Island (45 km/17.3 sq mi) (not to be confused with the  Canadian province of the same name ).           Weather averages for Cape Town, South Africa         Month   Jan   Feb   Mar   Apr   May   Jun   Jul   Aug   Sep   Oct   Nov   Dec   Year       Average high C (F)   27  (81)   28  (82)   26  (79)   24  (75)   20  (68)   18  (64)   17  (63)   18  (64)   19  (66)   22  (72)   24  (75)   26  (79)   28  (82)       Average low C (F)   16  (61)   16  (61)   15  (59)   13  (55)   10  (50)   8  (46)   8  (46)   8  (46)   9  (48)   11  (52)   14  (57)   15  (59)   8  (46)       Precipitation  mm (inches)   16.5  (0.65)   13  (0.51)   20  (0.79)   54  (2.13)   92  (3.62)   111  (4.37)   96  (3.78)   87  (3.43)   56  (2.2)   40  (1.57)   24  (0.94)   18  (0.71)   627  (24.69)       Source: EuroWEATHER [ 29 ]  2008-02-22         Flora and fauna     See also:  Wildlife of South Africa   See also:  Protected areas of South Africa             Fynbos , a  floral kingdom  unique to South Africa, is found near  Cape Town               Swartberg  mountains near the town of  Oudtshoorn              A field of flowers in Weskus National Park.       South Africa is one of only 17 countries worldwide considered  megadiverse . It has more than 20,000 different  plants , or about 10% of all the known  species  of plants on  Earth , making it particularly rich in plant biodiversity. South Africa is the 6th most biodiverse country, [ 30 ]  after  Brazil ,  Colombia ,  Indonesia ,  China , and  Mexico . The most prevalent biome in South Africa is the  grassland , particularly on the  Highveld , where the plant cover is dominated by different  grasses , low  shrubs , and  acacia trees , mainly camel-thorn and whitethorn.  Vegetation  becomes even more sparse towards the northwest due to low  rainfall . There are several species of water-storing  succulents  like  aloes  and euphorbias in the very hot and dry  Namaqualand  area. The grass and thorn  savannah  turns slowly into a bush savannah towards the north-east of the country, with denser growth. There are significant numbers of  baobab  trees in this area, near the northern end of  Kruger National Park . [ 31 ]   The  Fynbos   Biome , which makes up the majority of the area and plant life in the  Cape floristic region , one of the six  floral kingdoms , is located in a small region of the  Western Cape  and contains more than 9,000 of those species, making it among the richest regions on earth in terms of floral biodiversity. The majority of the plants are  evergreen  hard-leaf plants with fine, needle-like  leaves , such as the  sclerophyllous  plants. Another uniquely South African plant is the  protea  genus of flowering plants. There are around 130 different species of protea in South Africa.   While South Africa has a great wealth of flowering plants, it has few  forests . Only 1% of South Africa is forest, almost exclusively in the  humid   coastal plain  along the  Indian Ocean  in  KwaZulu-Natal  (see  KwaZulu-Cape coastal forest mosaic ). There are even smaller reserves of forests that are out of the reach of  fire , known as montane forests (see  Knysna-Amatole montane forests ).  Plantations  of imported tree species are predominant, particularly the non-native  eucalyptus  and  pine . South Africa has lost a large area of natural habitat in the last four decades, primarily due to  overpopulation , sprawling development patterns and  deforestation  during the nineteenth century. South Africa is one of the worst affected countries in the world when it comes to invasion by alien species with many (e.g.  Black Wattle ,  Port Jackson ,  Hakea ,  Lantana  and  Jacaranda ) posing a significant threat to the native  biodiversity  and the already scarce water resources. The original  temperate forest  that met the first European settlers to South Africa was exploited ruthlessly until only small patches remained. Currently, South African  hardwood  trees like  Real Yellowwood   (Podocarpus latifolius) ,  stinkwood   (Ocotea bullata) , and South African  Black Ironwood   (Olea laurifolia)  are under government protection.   Numerous  mammals  are found in the  bushveld  habitats including  lions ,  leopards ,  white rhinos ,  blue wildebeest ,  kudus ,  impalas ,  hyenas ,  hippopotamus  and  giraffes . A significant extent of the bushveld habitat exists in the north-east including  Kruger National Park  and the  Mala Mala  Reserve, as well as in the far north in the  Waterberg Biosphere .   Climate change is expected to bring considerable warming and drying to much of this already semi-arid region, with greater frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, flooding and drought. According to computer generated climate modelling produced by the South African National Biodiversity Institute [ 32 ]  parts of southern Africa will see an increase in temperature by about one degree Celsius along the coast to more than four degrees Celsius in the already hot hinterland such as the  Northern Cape  in late spring and summertime by 2050.   The Cape Floral Kingdom has been identified as one of the global  biodiversity hotspots  since it will be hit very hard by  climate change  and has such a great diversity of life. Drought, increased intensity and frequency of fire and climbing temperatures are expected to push many of these  rare species  towards  extinction .   South Africa houses many endemic species, among them the  critically endangered   Riverine Rabbit  ( Bunolagus monticullaris ) in the  Karoo .     Economy       Main article:  Economy of South Africa              The  Victoria & Alfred Waterfront  in  Cape Town  with  Table Mountain  in the background. Cape Town has become an important  retail  and  tourism  centre for the country, and attracts the largest number of foreign visitors in South Africa       By  UN  classification South Africa is a middle-income country with an abundant supply of resources, well-developed financial, legal, communications, energy, and transport sectors, a  stock exchange  (the  JSE Limited ), that ranks among the top twenty in the world, and a modern infrastructure supporting an efficient distribution of goods to major urban centres throughout the entire region. South Africa is ranked 25th in the world in terms of  GDP  (PPP) as of 2007.   Advanced development is significantly localised around four areas: Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Durban, and Pretoria/Johannesburg. Beyond these four economic centres, development is marginal and poverty is still prevalent despite government efforts. Consequently the vast majority of South Africans are poor. However, key marginal areas have experienced rapid growth recently. Such areas include Mossel Bay to Plettenberg Bay; Rustenburg area; Nelspruit area; Bloemfontein; Cape West Coast; and the KwaZulu-Natal North Coast.   Even though South Africa has the seventh highest per capita income in Africa, only behind  Libya ,  Mauritius  it suffers from large income gaps and a  dual economy  marking it as a  developing country . South Africa has one of the highest rates of  income inequality  in the world. A decade of continual economic growth has helped to lower unemployment, but daunting economic and social problems remain. The average South African household income decreased considerably between 1995 and 2000. As for racial inequality,  Statistics South Africa  reported that in 1995 the average white household earned four times as much as the average black household. In 2000 the average white household was earning six times more than the average black household. [ 33 ]  The  affirmative action  policies have seen a rise in black economic wealth and an emerging black middle class. [ 34 ]  Other problems are crime, corruption, and  HIV / AIDS .   At the start of 2000, then President Thabo Mbeki vowed to promote economic growth and foreign investment by relaxing restrictive labour laws, stepping up the pace of  privatisation , and cutting unneeded governmental spending. His policies face strong opposition from organised  labour . South Africa is also the largest energy producer and consumer on the continent. South Africa is a popular tourist destination, and a substantial amount of revenue comes from tourism. [ 35 ]  Among the main attractions are the diverse and picturesque culture, the game reserves and the highly regarded local wines.   The South African  rand  (ZAR), is the most actively traded emerging  market currency  in the world. It has joined an elite club of fifteen currencies, the  Continuous linked settlement  (CLS), where forex transactions are settled immediately, lowering the risks of transacting across  time zones . The rand was the best-performing currency against the  United States dollar  (USD) between 2002 and 2005, according to the  Bloomberg  Currency Scorecard.   The volatility of the  rand  has affected economic activity, falling sharply during 2001 and hitting a historic low of 13.85  ZAR  to the  USD , raising fears of inflation, and causing the Reserve Bank to increase  interest rates . The rand has since recovered, trading at 7.13 ZAR to the dollar as of January 2008. However, as exporters are put under considerable pressure from a stronger domestic currency, many call for government intervention to help soften the rand.   Refugees from poorer neighbouring countries include many immigrants from the DRC, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Malawi and others, representing a large portion of the informal sector. With high unemployment levels amongst poorer South Africans,  xenophobia  is prevalent and many people born in South Africa feel resentful of immigrants who are seen to be depriving the native population of jobs, a feeling which has been given credibility by the fact that many South African employers have employed migrants from other countries for lower pay than South African citizens, especially in the  construction ,  tourism ,  agriculture  and  domestic service  industries. Illegal immigrants are also heavily involved in informal trading. [ 36 ]  However, many immigrants to South Africa continue to live in poor conditions, and the South African immigration policy has become increasingly restrictive since 1994. [ 37 ]   Principal international trading partners of South Africa  besides other African countries  include  Germany ,  Japan ,  Switzerland , the  United Kingdom , and the  United States . Chief exports include  corn ,  diamonds ,  fruits ,  gold ,  metals  and  minerals ,  sugar , and  wool .  Machinery  and transportation equipment make up more than one-third of the value of the countrys imports. Other imports include  chemicals , manufactured goods, and  petroleum .     Electricity crisis   After unsuccessful attempts by the government to encourage private construction of electricity generation capacity, in 2007 the state-owned electricity supplier ( Eskom ) started experiencing a lack of capacity in the electrical generating and reticulation infrastructure. This led to an inability to meet the routine demands of industry and consumers, resulting in countrywide  rolling blackouts . Initially the lack of capacity was triggered by a failure at  Koeberg nuclear power station , but since then a general lack of capacity became evident. The supplier has been widely criticised for failing to adequately plan for and construct sufficient electrical generating capacity, [ 38 ]  although ultimately the government has admitted that it is at fault for refusing to approve funding for investment in infrastructure. [ 39 ]     Agriculture          Workers planting on a farm in the central area of  Mpumalanga .               Farm  workers.       South Africa has a large agricultural sector and is a net exporter of  farming  products. There are almost a thousand  agricultural cooperatives  and  agribusinesses  throughout the country, and agricultural exports have constituted 8% of South African total exports for the past five years. The agricultural industry contributes around 10% of formal employment, relatively low compared to other parts of Africa, as well as providing work for casual labourers and contributing around 2.6% of  GDP  for the nation. [ 40 ]  However, due to the  aridity  of the land, only 13.5% can be used for crop production, and only 3% is considered high potential land. [ 41 ]   Although the commercial farming sector is relatively well developed, people in some rural areas still survive on  subsistence agriculture . It is the eighth largest wine producer in the world, and the eleventh largest producer of sunflower seed. South Africa is a net exporter of agricultural products and foodstuffs, the largest number of exported items being  sugar ,  grapes ,  citrus ,  nectarines ,  wine  and  deciduous  fruit. The largest locally produced crop is  maize  (corn), and it has been estimated that 9 million tons are produced every year, with 7.4 million tons being consumed.  Livestock  are also popular on South African farms, with the country producing 85% of all meat consumed. The dairy industry consists of around 4,300 milk producers providing employment for 60,000 farm workers and contributing to the livelihoods of around 40,000 others. [ 42 ]   In recent years, the agricultural sector has introduced several reforms, some of which are controversial, such as  land reform  and the deregulation of the market for agricultural products. Land reform has been criticised both by farmers' groups and by landless workers, the latter alleging that the pace of change has not been fast enough, and the former alleging racist treatment and expressing concerns that a similar situation to  Zimbabwe's land reform policy  may develop, [ 43 ]  a fear exacerbated by comments made by  deputy president , the deputy president of South Africa. [ 44 ] [ 45 ]  The sector continues to face problems, with increased foreign competition and crime being two of the major challenges for the industry. The government has been accused of either putting in too much effort [ 46 ] , or not enough effort [ 47 ] , to tackle the problem of  farm attacks  as opposed to other forms of violent crime.   Another issue which affects South African agriculture is environmental damage caused by misuse of the land and global climate change. South Africa is unusually vulnerable to climate change and resultant diminution of surface waters. Some predictions show surface water supply could decrease by 60% by the year 2070 in parts of the Western Cape. [ 48 ]  To reverse the damage caused by land mismanagement, the government has supported a scheme which promotes  sustainable development  and the use of natural resources. [ 49 ]  Maize production, which contributes to a 36% majority of the gross value of South Africas field crops, has also experienced negative effects due to climate change. The estimated value of loss, which takes into consideration scenarios with and without the carbon dioxide fertilization effect [2]  ,ranges between 10s to 100s of millions of Rands.

South Africa is a nation of more than 48 million people of diverse origins,  cultures ,  languages , and  religions . The last  census  was held in 2001 and the next will be in 2011.  Statistics South Africa  provided five  racial  categories by which people could classify themselves, the last of which, ""unspecified/other"" drew negligible responses, and these results were omitted. [ 51 ]  The 2006 midyear estimated figures for the other categories were  Black African  at 79.5%,  White  at 9.2%,  Coloured  at 8.9%, and  Indian or Asian  at 2.5%. [ 52 ]  Even though the population of South Africa has increased in the past decade [ 51 ] [ 53 ]  (primarily due to immigration), the country had an annual population growth rate of 0.501% in 2008 (CIA est.), including immigration. [ 54 ]  South Africa is home to an estimated 5 million  illegal immigrants , including some 3 million  Zimbabweans . [ 55 ] [ 56 ] [ 57 ]  A series of  anti-immigrant riots  occurred in South Africa beginning on 11 May 2008. [ 58 ] [ 59 ]   By far the major part of the population classified itself as African or black, but it is not culturally or linguistically homogeneous. Major ethnic groups include the  Zulu ,  Xhosa ,  Basotho  (South Sotho),  Bapedi  (North Sotho),  Venda ,  Tswana ,  Tsonga ,  Swazi  and  Ndebele , all of which speak  Bantu languages  (see  Bantu peoples of South Africa ).   Some, such as the Zulu, Xhosa, Bapedi and Venda groups, are unique to South Africa. Other groups are distributed across the borders with neighbours of South Africa: The  Basotho  group is also the major ethnic group in  Lesotho . The  Tswana  ethnic group constitute the majority of the population of  Botswana . The  Swazi  ethnic group is the major ethnic group in  Swaziland . The  Ndebele  ethnic group is also found in  Matabeleland  in  Zimbabwe , where they are known as the  Matabele . These Ndebele people are the descendants of a Zulu faction under the warrior  Mzilikazi  that escaped persecution from  Shaka  by migrating to their current territory. The  Tsonga  ethnic group is also found in southern  Mozambique , where they are known as the Shangaan.   The white population is not ethnically homogenous and descend from many ethnic groups:  Dutch ,  Flemish ,  Portuguese , German, French  Huguenot , English, Irish, Italian, Scottish and  Welsh . Culturally and linguistically, they are divided into the  Afrikaners , who speak  Afrikaans , and English-speaking groups, many of whom are descended from British and Irish immigrants (see  Anglo-African ). Many small communities that have immigrated over the last century retain the use of other languages. The  white population  is on the decrease due to a low birth rate and emigration; as a factor in their decision to emigrate, many cite the high  crime  rate and the  affirmative action  policies of the government. Since 1994, approximately 1 000 000 white South Africans have permanently emigrated. [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ] [ 63 ]  Despite high emigration levels, a high level of non-South African white immigrants have settled in the country, in particular from countries such as  Britain  and  Zimbabwe . For example, by 2005, an estimated 212 000 British citizens were residing in South Africa. Since 2003, the numbers of British migrants coming to South Africa has risen by 50%. An estimated 20 000 British migrants moved to South Africa in 2007. There have also been a significant number of  white Zimbabwean  arrivals, fleeing their home country in light of the economic and political problems currently facing the country. As well as recent arrivals, a significant number of white Zimbabweans emigrated to South Africa in the wake of independence in Zimbabwe in 1980. Some of the more nostalgic members of the community are known in popular culture as "" Whenwes "", because of their nostalgia for their lives in  Rhodesia  ""when we were in Rhodesia"". [ 64 ]   The term  Coloured  is still largely used for the people of mixed race descended from slaves brought in from East and Central Africa, the indigenous  Khoisan  who lived in the  Cape  at the time, Bantus, Whites (mostly the  Dutch / Afrikaner  and British settlers) as well as an admixture of  Javanese ,  Malay , Indian,  Malagasy  and Asian blood (such as  Burmese ). The majority speak Afrikaans. Khoisan is a term used to describe two separate groups, physically similar: light-skinned and small in stature. The  Khoikhoi , who were called  Hottentots  by the Europeans, were pastoralists and were annihilated; the San, called  Bushmen  by the Europeans, were hunter-gatherers. Within the Coloured community, more recent immigrants will also be found: Coloureds from the former  Rhodesia  (now  Zimbabwe );  Namibia  and immigrants of mixed descent from India and  Burma  ( Anglo-Indians / Anglo-Burmese ) who were welcomed to the Cape when India and Burma received their Independence.   The major part of the South African  Asian  population is Indian in origin (see  Indian South Africans ); many of them descended from indentured workers brought in the nineteenth century to work on the  sugar   plantations  of the eastern coastal area then known as  Natal . There is also a significant group of  Chinese South Africans  (approximately 100,000 individuals) and  Vietnamese  South Africans (approximately 50,000 individuals). In 2008, the Pretoria High Court has ruled that Chinese South Africans who arrived before 1994 are to be reclassified as  Coloureds . As a result of this ruling, about 12,000 - 15,000  [ 65 ] ethnically Chinese citizens who arrived before 1994, numbering 3%-5% of the total Chinese population in the country, will be able to benefit from government  BEE  policies. [ 66 ]   South Africa hosts a sizeable refugee and asylum seeker population. According to the  World Refugee Survey 2008 , published by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, this population numbered approximately 144,700 in 2007. [ 67 ]  Groups of refugees and asylum seekers numbering over 10,000 included people from  Zimbabwe  (48,400), The  Democratic Republic of the Congo  (24,800), and  Somalia  (12,900). [ 67 ]  These populations mainly lived in Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban, Cape Town, and Port Elizabeth. [ 67 ]     Science and technology   Several important scientific and technological developments have originated in South Africa.  The first human to human heart transplant was performed by cardiac surgeon  Christiaan Barnard  at  Groote Schuur Hospital  in December 1967  .  Max Theiler  developed a vaccine against Yellow Fever,  Allan McLeod Cormack  pioneered x-ray  Computed tomography , and  Aaron Klug  developed crystallographic electron microscopy techniques. These advancements were all recognized with  Nobel Prizes .  Sydney Brenner  won most recently, in 2002, for his pioneering work in  molecular biology .   Mark Shuttleworth  founded an early Internet security company  Thawte , that was subsequently bought out by world-leader  VeriSign . Despite government efforts to encourage entrepreneurship in biotechnology, IT and other high technology fields, no other notable groundbreaking companies have been founded in South Africa. However, it is the expressed objective of the government to transition the economy to be more reliant on high technology, based on the realization that South African cannot compete with Far Eastern economies in manufacturing, nor can the republic rely on its mineral wealth in perpetuity.   South Africa has cultivated a burgeoning astronomy community. It hosts the  Southern African Large Telescope , the largest optical telescope in the southern hemisphere. South Africa is currently building the  Karoo Array Telescope  as a pathfinder for the $20 billion  Square Kilometer Array  project. South Africa is a finalist, with Australia, to be the host of the SKA.     Society and culture       Main article:  Culture of South Africa              Decorated houses,  Drakensberg Mountains              Traditional  South African cuisine .       It may be argued that there is no ""single"" culture in South Africa because of its ethnic diversity. Today, the diversity in foods from many cultures is enjoyed by all and especially marketed to tourists who wish to sample the large variety of South African cuisine. In addition to  food ,  music  and  dance  feature prominently.   South African cuisine  is heavily  meat-based  and has spawned the distinctively South African social gathering known as a  braai , or barbecue. South Africa has also developed into a major  wine  producer, with some of the best  vineyards  lying in valleys around  Stellenbosch ,  Franschoek ,  Paarl  and  Barrydale . [ 68 ]   There is great diversity in music from South Africa. Many black musicians who sang in Afrikaans or English during apartheid have since begun to sing in traditional African languages, and have developed a unique style called  Kwaito . Of note is  Brenda Fassie , who launched to fame with her song ""Weekend Special"", which was sung in English. More famous traditional musicians include  Ladysmith Black Mambazo , while the  Soweto String Quartet  performs classic music with an African flavour. White and Coloured South African singers are historically influenced by European musical styles including such western metal bands such as  Seether  (formerly Saron Gas). South Africa has produced world-famous jazz musicians, notably  Hugh Masekela ,  Jonas Gwangwa ,  Abdullah Ibrahim ,  Miriam Makeba ,  Jonathan Butler ,  Chris McGregor , and  Sathima Bea Benjamin .  Afrikaans  music covers multiple genres, such as the  contemporary   Steve Hofmeyr  and the  punk rock  band  Fokofpolisiekar . Crossover artists such as  Johnny Clegg  and his bands  Juluka  and  Savuka  have enjoyed various success underground, publicly, and abroad.   The South African black majority still has a substantial number of rural inhabitants who lead largely impoverished lives. It is among these people, however, that cultural traditions survive most strongly; as blacks have become increasingly  urbanised  and  westernised , aspects of traditional culture have declined. Urban blacks usually speak English or  Afrikaans  in addition to their native tongue. There are smaller but still significant groups of speakers of  Khoisan languages  who are not included in the eleven official languages, but are one of the eight other officially recognised languages. There are small groups of speakers of  endangered languages , most of which are from the Khoi-San family, that receive no official status; however, some groups within South Africa are attempting to promote their use and revival.   The  middle class  lifestyle, predominantly of the white minority but with growing numbers of Black, Coloured and Indian people, [ 69 ]  is similar in many respects to that of people found in  Western Europe , North America and  Australasia . Members of the middle class often study and work abroad for greater exposure to the markets of the world.   Asians , predominantly of Indian origin, preserve their own cultural heritage, languages and religious beliefs, being either  Christian ,  Hindu  or  Sunni Muslim  and speaking English, with Indian languages like  Hindi ,  Telugu ,  Tamil  or  Gujarati  being spoken less frequently, but the majority of Indians being able to understand their mother tongue. The first Indians arrived on the famous  Truro ship  as  indentured labourers  in Natal to work the Sugar Cane Fields. There is a much smaller  Chinese  community in South Africa, although its numbers have increased due to immigration from  Republic of China  (Taiwan).   South Africa has also had a large influence in the  Scouting  movement, with many Scouting traditions and ceremonies coming from the experiences of  Robert Baden-Powell  (the founder of Scouting) during his time in South Africa as a military officer in the 1890s. The  South African Scout Association  was one of the first youth organisations to open its doors to youth and adults of all races in South Africa. This happened on 2 July 1977 at a conference known as  Quo Vadis . [ 70 ]   The South African music scene consists of  Kwaito , a new music genre that had developed in the mid 80s and has since developed to become the most popular social economical form of representation among the populous. Though some may argue that the political aspects of Kwaito has since diminished after  Apartheid , and the relative interest in politics has become a minor aspect of daily life. Some argue that in a sense,  Kwaito  is in fact a political force that shows activism in its apolitical actions. Today, major corporations like  Sony ,  BMG , and  EMI  have appeared on the South African scene to produce and distribute  Kwaito  music. Due to its overwhelming popularity, as well as the general influence of DJs, who are among the top 5 most influential types of people within the country,  Kwaito  has taken over radio, television, and magazines. [ 71 ]   Kwaito , much like most hip-hop has its own local flavor and originality. However, unlike when hip-hop first burst on the scene as a politically driven and rebellious underground movement, South Africans wanted to create a happier vibe. As the post-apartheid fog cleared, South African youth found their ""own voice in a style of music known as kwaito, spawning a new (and profitable) industry"". [ 72 ]  According to TIMEeurope magazine, ""The kwaito sound now regularly incorporates traditional African music, jazz, gospel, and even rock guitar, most notably on Mandoza's 2000 hit Nkalakatha, one of the few kwaito records to cross over onto traditionally white radio"". [ 73 ]  In the kwaito, the samples from old school  Jamaican dancehall , European house, etc.,  tempos  are changed, beats are added, and urban street slang is also incorporated. This local flavor of music more recently has been attacked for its lack of ingenuity and its betrayal of its roots. The melodies and the incorporation of sex and dance have since become very similar to the American standard. In addition Kwaito has been criticised for its absence of influential lyrical content. As Kwaito is still a developing genre, and since the South African population is only around 48 million, sales of only 25,000 CDs are required for ""gold"" certification in South Africa. [ 72 ]     Religion       Main article:  Religion in South Africa               St. Mark 's Anglican Cathedral.       According to the latest 2001 national census, Christians accounted for 79.7% of the population. This includes  Zion Christian  11.1%,  Pentecostal  ( Charismatic ) 8.2%,  Roman Catholic  7.1%,  Methodist  6.8%,  Dutch Reformed  6.7%,  Anglican  3.8%, and other Christian 36%.  Islam  accounted for 1.5% of the population,  Hinduism  about 1.3%, and  Judaism  0.2%. 15.1% had no religious affiliation, 2.3% were other and 1.4% were unspecified. [ 74 ] [ 75 ]   African Indigenous Churches were the largest of the  Christian  groups. It was believed that many of these persons who claimed no affiliation with any organised religion adhered to  traditional indigenous religions . Many peoples have  syncretic  religious practices combining Christian and indigenous influences. [ 76 ]   Islam in South Africa  itself is not known to pre-date the colonial period, despite the isolated contact neighbouring  Mozambique  had with  Arab  and  East African  traders. [ citation needed ]  There is no evidence that Islam was known to the  Zulu ,  Swazi , or  Xhosa  of the east coast prior to the colonial era. Many South African Muslims are described as  Coloureds , notably in the  Western Cape , especially those whose ancestors came as slaves from the Indonesian archipelago (the  Cape Malays ). Others are described as  Indians , notably in  KwaZulu-Natal , including those whose ancestors came as traders from  South Asia ; they have been joined by others from other parts of Africa as well as white or black South African converts. It is estimated that  Islam  is the fastest growing religion of conversion in the country, [ 77 ]  with the number of black  Muslims  growing sixfold, from 12,000 in 1991 to 74,700 in 2004. [ 78 ]   Hinduism  dates back to British Colonial period primarily but later waves of continuous immigrants from India have contributed to a sizable Hindu population. Most Hindus are ethnically South Asian but there are many who come from mixed racial stock and many are converts with the efforts of Hindu missionaries such as ISKCON. Other religions in smaller numbers are  Sikhism ,  Jainism  and  Bah' Faith . [ 75 ]     Languages       Main article:  Languages of South Africa              Map showing principal South African languages by municipality. Lighter shades indicate a non-majority  plurality .             Afrikaans          Northern Sotho          Southern Sotho          Swati          Tsonga            Tswana          Venda          Xhosa          Zulu               South Africa has eleven  official languages : [ 79 ]   Sepedi ,  Sesotho ,  Setswana ,  siSwati ,  Tshivenda ,  Xitsonga ,  Afrikaans ,  English ,  isiNdebele ,  isiXhosa  and  isiZulu . In this regard it is  second only to India  in number. While each language is formally equal to every other, some languages are spoken more than others. According to the 2001 National Census, the three most spoken first home languages are Zulu (23.8%), Xhosa (17.6%) and Afrikaans (13.3%). [ 51 ]  Despite the fact that English is recognised as the language of commerce and science, it was spoken by only 8.2% of South Africans at home in 2001, an even lower percentage than in 1996 (8.6%). [ 51 ]   There are  eleven official names  for South Africa, one in each of the official national languages. The country also recognises eight non-official languages:  Fanagalo ,  Khoe ,  Lobedu ,  Nama ,  Northern Ndebele ,  Phuthi ,  San  and  South African Sign Language . [ citation needed ]  These non-official languages may be used in certain official uses in limited areas where it has been determined that these languages are prevalent. Nevertheless, their populations are not such that they require nationwide recognition.   Many of the ""unofficial languages"" of the  San  and  Khoikhoi  people contain regional  dialects  stretching northward into Namibia and Botswana, and elsewhere. These people, who are a physically distinct population from other Africans, have their own cultural identity based on their  hunter-gatherer  societies. They have been marginalised to a great extent, and many of their languages are in danger of becoming  extinct .   Many white South Africans also speak other European languages, such as  Portuguese  (also spoken by Angolan and Mozambican blacks), German, and  Greek , while some  Asians  and  Indians  in South Africa speak  South Asian  languages, such as  Tamil ,  Hindi ,  Gujarati ,  Urdu  and  Telugu .  French  is still widely spoken by French South Africans especially in places like  Franschhoek , where many South Africans are of French origin. South African French is spoken by less than 10,000 individuals. Congolese French is also spoken in South Africa by migrants.

In golf,  Gary Player  is generally regarded as one of the greatest golfers of all time, having won the  Career Grand Slam , one of five golfers to have done so. Other South African golfers to have successfully won a major tournament include  Bobby Locke ,  Ernie Els ,  Retief Goosen  and  Trevor Immelman .     Current issues     HIV/AIDS       Main article:  HIV/AIDS in South Africa       The spread of  AIDS  (acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome) is an alarming problem in South Africa with up to 31% of pregnant women found to be HIV infected in 2005 and the infection rate among adults estimated at 20%. [ 80 ]  The link between HIV, a virus spread primarily by sexual contact, and AIDS was long denied by prior president  Thabo Mbeki  and then health minister  Manto Tshabalala-Msimang , who insisted that the many deaths in the country are due to malnutrition, and hence poverty, and not HIV. [ 81 ]  In 2007, in response to international pressure, the government made efforts to fight AIDS. [ 82 ]  In September 2008 Thabo Mbeki was ousted by the ANC and  Kgalema Motlanthe  was appointed for the interim. One of Mr. Motlanthe's first actions was to replace Mrs. Tshabalala-Msimang with the current minister,  Barbara Hogan .   AIDS affects mainly those who are sexually active and is far more prevalent in the black population. Most deaths are people who are also economically active, resulting in many families losing their primary wage earners. This has resulted in many 'AIDS orphans' who in many cases depend on the state for care and financial support. [ 83 ]  It is estimated that there are 1,200,000 orphans in South Africa. [ 83 ]  Many elderly people also lose the support from lost younger members of their family. Roughly 5 million people are infected with the disease. [ 82 ]     Crime       Main article:  Crime in South Africa               Prison  buildings on  Robben Island       According to a survey for the period 19982000 compiled by the  United Nations , South Africa was ranked second for  murder  and first for  assaults  and  rapes  per capita. [ 84 ]  Total crime per capita is 10th out of the 60 countries in the data set.   Crime  has had a pronounced effect on society: many middle-class South Africans moved into  gated communities , abandoning the central business districts of some cities for the relative security of suburbs. This effect is most pronounced in  Johannesburg , although the trend is noticeable in other cities as well. [ citation needed ]  Many emigrants from South Africa also state that crime was a big motivator for them to leave.  Crime against the farming community  has continued to be a major problem. [ 85 ]     Skills migration   Along with many African nations, South Africa has been experiencing a "" brain drain "" in the past 20 years. This is believed to be potentially damaging for the regional economy, [ 86 ]  and is almost certainly detrimental for the well-being of the majority of people reliant on the healthcare infrastructure, given the HIV/AIDS epidemic. [ 87 ]  The skills drain in South Africa tends to demonstrate racial contours (naturally given the skills distribution legacy of South Africa) and has thus resulted in large white South African communities abroad.

Located at roughly 13 North of the  equator  and 59 West of the  prime meridian , it is considered a part of the  Lesser Antilles . Its closest island neighbours are  Saint Vincent & the Grenadines  and  Saint Lucia  to the west. To the south lies  Trinidad and Tobago with which Barbados now shares a fixed official maritime boundaryand also the  South American  mainland. Barbados's total land area is about 430 square kilometres (166 square miles), and is primarily low-lying, with some higher in the country's interior. The highest point in Barbados is  Mount Hillaby  in the parish of Saint Andrew. The geological composition of Barbados is of non-volcanic origin and is predominantly composed of  limestone - coral  formed by subduction of the South American plate colliding with the Caribbean plate. The island's climate is  tropical , with constant  trade winds  off the Atlantic Ocean serving to keep temperatures mild. Some less developed areas of the country contain tropical woodland and  mangroves . Other parts of the interior which contribute to the agriculture industry are dotted with large  sugarcane  estates and wide, gently sloping  pastures , with panoramic views down to the coast also.   Barbados's  human development index  ranking is consistently among the top 75 countries in the world. For example, in 2006, it was ranked 31st in the world, and third in the Americas, behind  Canada  and the  United States .

The origin of the name ""Barbados"" is controversial. The  Portuguese , en route to  Brazil  are credited as the first Europeans to discover and name the island. It is a matter of conjecture whether the word ""bearded"" refers to the long, hanging roots of the bearded fig-tree ( Ficus citrifolia ), indigenous to the island, to bearded  Caribs  inhabiting the island, or to the foam spraying over the outlying reefs giving the impression of a beard. In 1519, a map produced by the Genoese mapmaker  Visconte Maggiolo  showed and named Barbados in its correct position southeast of the island of  Dominica .   Another name associated with Barbados or her people is ""Bim"" or ""Bimshire"". The origin is uncertain but several theories abound, the  National Cultural Foundation  of Barbados follows the Dr.  Richard Allsopp  theory, which is that ""Bim"" was a word commonly used by slaves and that it derives from the phrase ""bi mu"" [ 3 ]  or either (""bem"", ""Ndi bem"", ""Nwanyi ibem"" or ""Nwoke ibem"") [ 4 ]  from an  Igbo  phrase, meaning ""my people."" In colloquial or literary contexts, ""Bim"" can also take a more deific tone, referring to the ""goddess"" Barbados. [ citation needed ]  The word Bim and Bimshire are recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary and the Chamber's Twentieth Century Dictionaries. Another possible source for ""Bim"" is reported to be in the Agricultural Reporter of 25 April 1868, The Rev. N Greenidge (father of one of the island's most famous scholars, Abel Hendy Jones Greenidge) suggested the listing of Bimshire as a county of England. Expressly named were ""Wiltshire, Hampshire, Berkshire, and Bimshire"". [ 5 ]  Lastly in the Daily Argosy (of Demerara i.e. Guyana) of 1652 it referred to Bim as a possible corruption of the word "" Byam "", who was a Royalist leader against the Parliamentarians. That source suggested the followers of Byam became known as Bims and became a word for all Barbadians. [ 6 ]     [ edit ]   Early history   The first indigenous people are thought to be  Amerindians  who arrived from  Venezuela  around approximately 350-400 B.C. The  Arawak  people were the second wave of migrants, arriving from South America around 800. In the thirteenth century, the Caribs arrived from South America in the third wave, displacing both the Arawak and the Salodoid-Barrancoid culture. For the next few centuries, the Caribs  like the Arawak and the Salodoid-Barrancoid  lived in isolation on the island.   The  Portuguese  then briefly claimed Barbados from the mid-1500s to the 1600s; and may have seized the indigenous  Caribs  on Barbados and used them as  slave labour . Other Caribs are believed to have fled the island to neighbouring islands. Apart from possibly displacing the Caribs, the Portuguese left little impact and by the 1610s, they left for South America, leaving the island uninhabited.     [ edit ]   British colonial rule   British sailors who landed on Barbados in 1625 arrived at the site of present-day  Holetown . From the arrival of the first British settlers in 16271628 until independence in 1966, Barbados was under uninterrupted British control. Nevertheless, Barbados always enjoyed a large measure of local autonomy. Its  House of Assembly  began meeting in 1639. Among the initial important British figures was Sir  William Courten .   With the increased implementation of slave codes, which created differential treatment between Africans and the white workers and planters, the island became increasingly unattractive to  poor whites . Black or slave codes were implemented in 1661, 1676, 1682, and 1688. In response to these codes, several slave rebellions were attempted or planned during this time, but none succeeded. However, an increasingly repressive legal system caused the gap between the treatment of typically white indentured servants and black slaves to widen. Imported slaves became much more attractive for the rich planters who would increasingly dominate the island not only economically but also politically. Some have speculated that, because the Africans could withstand tropical diseases and the climate much better than the white slave population, the white population decreased. This is inconsistent with the fact that many poor whites simply migrated to neighbouring islands and remained in tropical climates. Nevertheless, poor whites who had or acquired the means to emigrate often did so. Planters expanded their importation of African slaves to cultivate sugar cane. The Barbados turned from mainly English and Scots-Irish in the seventeenth century to overwhelmingly black by the end of the 18th century.   Barbados eventually had one of the world's biggest sugar industries after Jews from Brazil introduced the sugarcane to the island in the mid 1600s. This quickly replaced  tobacco  plantations on the islands which were previously the main export. As the  sugar  industry developed into its main commercial enterprise, Barbados was divided into large plantation estates that replaced the smallholdings of the early British settlers. Some of the displaced farmers moved to other British colonies in the Americas, most notably  North  and  South Carolina , and  British Guiana , as well as  Panama . To work the plantations, planters imported enslaved West Africans to Barbados and other Caribbean islands.   The British abolished the  slave trade  in 1807 but not the institution itself. In 1816, slaves arose in the largest major slave rebellion in the island's history. Twenty thousand slaves from over seventy plantations rebelled. They drove whites off the plantations, but widespread killings did not take place. This was later termed Bussa's Rebellion after the slave ranger Bussa, who with his assistants hated slavery, found the treatment of slaves on Barbados to be intolerable, and believed the political climate in the UK made the time ripe to peacefully negotiate with planters for freedom (Davis, p. 211; Northrup, p. 191). Bussa's Rebellion failed. One hundred and twenty slaves died in combat or were immediately executed; another 144 were brought to trial and executed; remaining rebels were shipped off the island (Davis, pp. 212-213).   Slavery was finally abolished in the British Empire eighteen years later in 1834. In Barbados and the rest of the British West Indian colonies, full emancipation from slavery was preceded by an apprenticeship period that lasted four years.          Statue of  Lord Nelson  in  National Heroes Square  which predates the more famous  Nelson's Column  by some 27 years.       In 1884, the Barbados Agricultural Society sent a letter to  Sir Francis Hincks  requesting his private and public views on whether the Dominion of Canada would favourably entertain having the then colony of Barbados admitted as a member of the Canadian Confederation. Asked of  Canada  were the terms of the Canadian side to initiate discussions, and whether or not the island of Barbados could depend on the full influence of Canada in getting the change agreed to by the  United Kingdom . Then in 1952 the  Barbados Advocate  newspaper polled several prominent Barbadian politicians, lawyers, businessmen, the Speaker of the  Barbados House of Assembly  and later as first President of the  Senate , Sir Theodore Branker , Q.C. and found them to be in favour of immediate federation of Barbados along with the rest of the British  Caribbean  with complete Dominion Status within five years from the date of inauguration of the  West Indies Federation  with Canada.   However, plantation owners and merchants of British descent still dominated local politics, owing to the high income qualification required for voting. More than 70% of the population, many of them disenfranchised women, were excluded from the democratic process. It was not until the 1930s that the descendants of emancipated slaves began a movement for political rights. One of the leaders of this movement,  Sir Grantley Adams , founded the  Barbados Labour Party  in 1938, then known as the Barbados Progressive League. While being a staunch supporter of the monarchy, Adams and his party also demanded more rights for the poor and for the people. Progress toward a more democratic government in Barbados was made in 1942, when the exclusive income qualification was lowered and women were given the right to vote. By 1949 governmental control was wrested from the planters and, in 1958, Adams became Premier of Barbados.   From 1958 to 1962, Barbados was one of the ten members of the  West Indies Federation , an organisation doomed by nationalistic attitudes and by the fact that its members, as British colonies, held limited legislative power. Adams served as its first and only ""Premier"", but his leadership failed in attempts to form similar unions, and his continued defence of the monarchy was used by his opponents as evidence that he was no longer in touch with the needs of his country.  Errol Walton Barrow , a fervent reformer, became the new people's advocate. Barrow had left the BLP and formed the  Democratic Labour Party  as a liberal alternative to Adams' conservative government. Barrow instituted many progressive social programmes, such as free education for all Barbadians, and the School Meals system. By 1961, Barrow had replaced Adams as Premier and the DLP controlled the government.   With the Federation dissolved, Barbados had reverted to its former status, that of a  self-governing colony . The island negotiated its own independence at a constitutional conference with the United Kingdom in June 1966. After years of peaceful and democratic progress, Barbados finally became an independent state on 30 November 1966, with Errol Barrow its first Prime Minister. Upon independence Barbados maintained historical linkages with Britain by establishing membership to the  Commonwealth of Nations  grouping, a year later Barbados' International linkages were expanded by obtaining membership to the  United Nations  and the  Organization of American States .     [ edit ]   Government and politics          Parliamentary building.           Main articles:  Politics of Barbados  and  Monarchy of Barbados       Barbados has been an independent country since 30 November 1966. It functions as a  constitutional monarchy  and  parliamentary democracy , modeled on the British  Westminster system , with  Elizabeth II ,  Queen of Barbados , as  head of state  represented locally by the  Governor-General ,  Clifford Husbands  and the  Prime Minister  as the  head of the government . Its  Parliament  comprises thirty seats. It has been proposed that Barbados become a  republic  with a  president  replacing the  Barbadian sovereign ; this issue is still being debated, as the island has been stable and governmentally autonomous for decades.   Barbados is a full and participating member of the  Caribbean Community  (CARICOM), the  Caribbean (CARICOM) Single Market and Economy  (CSME), the  Caribbean Court of Justice  (CCJ), which pertains only to Barbados and  Guyana  but is expected to replace the UK  Privy Council  for the entire English-speaking Caribbean eventually, and the  Association of Caribbean States  (ACS). [ 7 ]   Barbados has a two party system, the two dominant parties being the ruling  Democratic Labour Party  and the  Barbados Labour Party . The Barbados Labour Party (BLP) had been in government for fifteen years, since 1993 until the 2008 general election. Under this administration, the Former Prime Minister, The Right Honourable Owen S. Arthur also acted as the Regional Leader of the CSM (Caribbean Single Market). The Right Honorable David Thompson is the Prime Minister of Barbados. [ 8 ]   On 11 April 2006, the 5-Member  UNCLOS  Annex VII Arbitral Tribunal, presided over by H.E. Judge  Stephen M. Schwebel , rendered after two years of international judicial proceedings, the landmark Barbados/Trinidad and Tobago Award, which resolved the maritime boundary delimitation (in the East, Central and West sectors) to satisfaction of both Parties and committed Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago to resolve their fisheries dispute by means of concluding a new Fisheries Agreement.     [ edit ]   Geography and climate of Barbados       Main article:  Geography and climate of Barbados              Map of Barbados              Beach near  Bridgetown , Barbados.       Barbados is extremely small for a Caribbean island. Relatively flat, it rises gently to the central highland region, the highest point being  Mount Hillaby , in the Scotland District, at 340 meters (1,100 ft) above sea level. The island is located in the Atlantic Ocean, to the east of the other Caribbean islands. The  climate  is tropical, with a rainy season from June to October.   Barbados is often spared the worst effects of the region's tropical storms and  hurricanes  during the rainy season as its far eastern location in the Atlantic Ocean puts it just outside the principal hurricane strike zone, and a hurricane hits about every 26 years. The last significant hit from a hurricane to cause severe damage to Barbados was  Hurricane Janet  in 1955.   In the parish of  Saint Michael  lies Barbados' capital and main city,  Bridgetown . Locally Bridgetown is sometimes referred to as ""The City"", but the most common reference is simply ""Town"". Other towns scattered across the island include  Holetown , in the parish of  Saint James ;  Oistins , in the parish of  Christ Church , and Speightstown, in the parish of  Saint Peter .   It is geologically composed of coral (90 m/300 ft thick). The land falls in a series of ""terraces"" in the west and goes into an incline in the east. Most of Barbados is circled by coral reefs.   The climate is moderate tropical with two seasons: dry and wet. The dry season (DecemberMay) and wet season (JuneNovember) gives an annual rainfall of 40-90 inches (1,0002,300 mm).     [ edit ]   Parishes       Main article:  Parishes of Barbados              Map of the parishes of Barbados       Barbados is  divided  into eleven administrative  parishes :     Christ Church   Saint Andrew   Saint George   Saint James   Saint John   Saint Joseph   Saint Lucy   Saint Michael   Saint Peter   Saint Philip   Saint Thomas       [ edit ]   Economy       Main article:  Economy of Barbados       Historically, the economy of Barbados had been dependent on  sugarcane  cultivation and related activities, but in recent years it has diversified into the  manufacturing  and  tourism  sectors. Offshore finance and information services have become important foreign exchange earners, and there is a healthy light manufacturing sector. In recent years the Government has been seen as business-friendly and economically sound. Since the late 1990s the island has seen a construction boom, with the development and redevelopment of hotels, office complexes, and homes.   The government continues its efforts to reduce  unemployment , encourage direct foreign investment, and privatize remaining state-owned enterprises. Unemployment has been reduced from around 14 percent in the past to under 10 percent.          Circulating  coins  2006       The economy contracted in 2001 and 2002 due to slowdowns in tourism, consumer spending and the impact of the  September 11, 2001 attacks , but rebounded in 2003 and has shown growth since 2004. Traditional trading partners include Canada, the  Caribbean Community  (especially  Trinidad and Tobago ), the United Kingdom and the United States.   Business links and investment flows have become substantial: as of 2003 the island saw from Canada  CA$  25 billion in investment holdings, placing it as one of Canada's top five destinations for Canadian  Foreign Direct Investment  (FDI). Businessman  Eugene Melnyk  of  Toronto , Canada, is said to be Barbados' richest permanent resident.   It was thought by key Barbadian industry sources that the year 2006 would have been one of the busiest years for building construction ever in Barbados, as the building-boom on the island entered the final stages for several multi-million dollar projects. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Transport       Main article:  Transport in Barbados       Transport on the island is good, with 'route taxis', called ""ZR's"" (pronounced "" Zed -Rs"" not ""Zee-Rs""), travelling to most points on the island. These small buses can at times be crowded, as passengers are generally never turned down, regardless of the number. However, they will usually take the more scenic routes to destinations. They generally depart from the capital  Bridgetown  or from  Speightstown  in the northern part of the island.          A  Mini Moke  at  Speightstown  beach       The island of Barbados's lone airport is the  Sir Grantley Adams International Airport (GAIA)  ( IATA  identifier  BGI ). It receives daily flights by several major airlines from points around the globe, as well as several smaller regional commercial airlines and charters. The airport serves as the main air-transportation hub for the Eastern Caribbean. It is undergoing a US$100 million upgrade and expansion.   There are three bus systems running seven days a week (though less frequently on Sundays), and a ride on any of them costs $1.50 BBD. The smaller buses from the two privately-owned systems (""ZRs"" and ""minibuses"") can give change; the larger blue and yellow buses from the government-operated  Barbados Transport Board  system cannot. Most routes require a connection in Bridgetown. Some drivers within the competitive privately owned systems are reluctant to advise persons to use competing services, even if those would be more suitable.   Some hotels also provide visitors with shuttles to points of interest on the island from outside the hotel lobby. There are several locally-owned and -operated vehicle rental agencies in Barbados but there are no multi-national car-rental agencies such as Avis, Europcar or Hertz.   There is also a helicopter shuttle service, which offers air taxi services to a number of sites around the island, mainly on the West Coast tourist belt. Air and water traffic is regulated by the  Barbados Port Authority .     [ edit ]   Tourist information   The island is well developed, and there are internationally known hotels offering world-class accommodation. Time-shares are available, and many of the smaller local hotels and private villas which dot the island have space available if booked in advance. The southern and western coasts of Barbados are popular, with the calm light blue Atlantic Ocean and their fine white and pinkish sandy beaches. Along the island's east coast the Atlantic Ocean side are tumbling waves which are perfect for light  surfing , but a little bit risky due to under-tow currents.   Shopping  districts are popular in Barbados, with ample duty-free shopping. There is also a festive night-life in mainly tourist areas such as the  Saint Lawrence Gap . Other attractions include wildlife reserves, jewellery stores,  scuba diving , helicopter rides,  golf ,  festivals  (the largest being the annual crop over festival July/Aug), sightseeing, cave exploration, exotic  drinks  and fine  clothes   shopping .     [ edit ]   Attractions, landmarks and points of interest   Tourism accounts for almost one half of the economy.

Close to 90% of all Barbadians (also known colloquially as  Bajan ) are of  African  descent (""Afro-Bajans""). A mix of many African ethnicities, notably the  Igbo ,  Akan  and  Yoruba people , they are mostly descendants of the  slave  labourers on the sugar plantations. The remainder of the population includes groups of Europeans (""Anglo-Bajans"" / ""Euro-Bajans"") mainly from the  United Kingdom , the  Republic of Ireland , Chinese locally known as Bajan-Chiney, Bajan Hindus from  India  and Muslims from  Bangladesh  and  Pakistan , and an influential ""Arab-Bajans"" group mainly of Christian  Syrians  and  Lebanese  descent. On the island are many people of  Creole  descent, a mixture of Afro-Caribbean and European descent (Primarily British, Irish and  Portuguese ).   Other groups in Barbados include people from the  United Kingdom ,  United States  and  Canada . Barbadians who return after years of residence in the U.S. are called ""Bajan Yankees""; this term is considered derogatory by some.   The country's official language is English, the local dialect of which is referred to as  Bajan , spoken by most. In religion, most Barbadians are  Christians  (67%), chiefly of the  Anglican Church , but there are Protestant,  Roman Catholic ,  Jehovah's Witness ,  Hindu ,  Muslim  and  Jewish  minorities. Barbados is a chief destination for emigrants from the South American nation of  Guyana . The biggest communities outside the Afro-Caribbean community are:     The  Indo-Guyanese , an important part of the economy due to the increase of immigrants from partner country  Guyana . There are reports of a growing Indo-Bajan diaspora originating from Guyana and  India . They introduced soca-chutney ,  roti  and many Indian dishes to Barbados' culture. Mostly from southern India and Hindu states, these 'Desi' peoples are growing in size but smaller than the equivalent communities in Trinidad & Guyana; Hinduism is one of Barbados' growing religions.   Euro-Bajans (4% of the population) [ 10 ]  have settled in Barbados since the 1500s, originating from  England , Portugal, Ireland and  Scotland . In 1643, there were 37,200 whites in Barbados (86% of the population). [ 11 ]  More commonly they are known as "" White Bajans "", although some carry Afro-Caribbean traces and vice-versa. Euro-Bajans introduced folk music, such as  Irish music  and Highland music, and certain place names, such as ""Scotland"", a mountainous region, and ""Trafalgar Square"" in Bridgetown, now renamed ""Heroes Square"". Among White Barbadians there exists an underclass known as  Redlegs ; the descendants of  indentured servants , and prisoners imported to the island. [ 12 ]   Chinese -Barbadians (or, as they are known on the island, ""Bajan-Chineys"") are a small portion of Barbados' Asian demographics, smaller than the equivalent communities of  Jamaica  and  Trinidad . Most if not all first arrived in the 1940s during the Second World War, originating mainly from the then British territory of  Hong Kong . Many Chinese-Bajans have the surnames Chin, Chynn or Lee, although other surnames prevail in certain areas of the island. Chinese food and culture is becoming part of everyday Bajan culture.   Lebanese and Syrians form the Middle Eastern community on the island and make up 89% of the Muslim population. Middle-Eastern Barbadians are often perceived to be the most successful group in business, along with the Chinese Bajans. During the  Arab Israeli Wars , many Syrians and Lebanese headed for the West Indies to escape conflict and poverty in the  Middle East . [ citation needed ]  Also Jewish people arrived in Barbados around the same time, creating the biggest synagogue in the West Indies.   Latin Americans have been migrating to the island since the 18th century, due to the close proximity of  South America , many  Venezuelans  had migrated to Barbados as labourers via Trinidad.  Brazilian Jews ,  Colombians  and  Panamanians  also live on the island. The Spanish language is now being encouraged to be taught as a second language in Barbadian schools over French.       [ edit ]   Culture          Banks beer at dusk           Main article:  Culture of Barbados     See also:  Music of Barbados     The influence of the English on Barbados is more noticeable than on other islands in the West Indies. A good example of this is the island's national sport:  cricket . Barbados has brought forth several great cricketers, including  Garfield Sobers  and  Frank Worrell .   Citizens are officially called Barbadians; Barbados' residents, however, colloquially refer to themselves or the products of the country as ""Bajan"". The term ""Bajan"" may have come from a localized pronunciation of the word Barbadian which at times can sound more like ""Bar-bajan"".   The largest  carnival -like cultural event which takes place on the island is the  Crop Over  festival. As in many other Caribbean and Latin American countries,  Crop Over  is an important event for many people on the island, as well as the thousands of tourists that flock to the island to participate in the annual events. The festival includes musical competitions and other traditional activities. It gets under way from the beginning of July, and ends with the costumed parade on Kadooment Day, held on the first Monday of August.   Barbados retains a strong British influence and is referred to by its neighbours as ""Little England"".     [ edit ]   Sports in Barbados     See also:  Cricket in the West Indies     As in other Caribbean countries of British descent,  cricket  is a favourite sport. In addition to several warm-up matches and six ""Super Eight"" matches, Barbados hosted the final of the  2007 Cricket World Cup .   In  golf , the  Barbados Open  is an annual stop on the  European Seniors Tour . In December 2006 the  WGC-World Cup  took place at the country's  Sandy Lane  resort on the Country Club course, an eighteen-hole course designed by  Tom Fazio .   Motorsports also play a role, with Rally Barbados occurring each summer and currently being listed on the FIA NACAM calendar.   Basketball  is a popular sport played at school or college and is increasing in popularity as is  volleyball , though volleyball is mainly played inside. At certain beaches such as Brandons beach in St. Michael people do get together to play  beach volleyball .   Other sports played include  hockey ,  table tennis ,  road tennis ,  football ,  rugby ,  polo  and  swimming .   Netball  is also popular with women in Barbados.     [ edit ]   National symbols     [ edit ]   Flower          A yellow and red Pride of Barbados ( Caesalpinia pulcherrima ).       The national flower is the Pride of Barbados or  Caesalpinia pulcherrima  (L.) Sw., which grows across the island.     [ edit ]   Flag   The tridented centered within the flag is a representation of the mythological  Neptune , god of the sea. The trident in its original unbroken form was taken from the former colonial seal, which itself was replaced by the current coat of arms. Used within the national flag, the left and right shafts of the trident were then designed as 'broken' representing the nation of Barbados breaking away from its historical and constitutional ties as a former colony.   The three points of the  trident  represent in Barbados the three principles of  democracy  - ""government of, for and by the people."" The broken trident is set in a centered vertical band of gold representing the sands of Barbados' beaches. The gold band itself is surrounded on both sides by vertical bands of ultramarine (blue) representing the sea and sky of Barbados.   The design for the flag was created by Grantley W. Prescod and was chosen from an open competition arranged by the Barbados government. Over a thousand entries were received. [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   Golden Shield   The Golden Shield in the coat of arms carries two "" Pride of Barbados "" flowers and the ""bearded"" fig tree ( Ficus citrifolia  or  Ficus barbata ), which was common on the island at the time of its settlement by the British and may have contributed to Barbados being so named.     [ edit ]   Coat of arms   The  coat of arms  depicts two animals which are supporting the shield. On the left is a "" dolphin fish "", symbolic of the fishing industry and seagoing past of Barbados. On the right is a  pelican , symbolic of a small island named  Pelican Island  that once existed off the coast of Bridgetown. Above the shield is the helmet of Barbados with an extended arm clutching two  sugar-cane  stalks. The ""cross"" formation made by the cane stalks represents the saltire cross upon which  Saint Andrew  was crucified. On the base of the Coat of Arms reads ""Pride and Industry"" in reference to the country's motto.     [ edit ]   National heroes       Main article:  Barbadian national heroes       On April 1998, the Order of National Heroes Act was passed by the  Parliament of Barbados . According to the government, the act established that 28 April (the centenary of the birth of Sir Grantley Adams) would be celebrated as  National Heroes' Day . The act also declared that there are ten national heroes of Barbados. All of which would be elevated to the title of the The Right Excellent. [ 14 ]   The ten official National Heroes of Barbados are:-     Bussa  ( - 1816)   Sarah Ann Gill  (1795 - 1866)   Samuel Jackman Prescod  (1806 - 1871)   Dr. Charles Duncan ONeal  (1879 - 1936)   Clement Osbourne Payne  (1904 - 1941)   Sir Grantley Herbert Adams  (1898 - 1987)   Rt.

Located at roughly 13 North of the  equator  and 59 West of the  prime meridian , it is considered a part of the  Lesser Antilles . Its closest island neighbours are  Saint Vincent & the Grenadines  and  Saint Lucia  to the west. To the south lies  Trinidad and Tobago with which Barbados now shares a fixed official maritime boundaryand also the  South American  mainland. Barbados's total land area is about 430 square kilometres (166 square miles), and is primarily low-lying, with some higher in the country's interior. The highest point in Barbados is  Mount Hillaby  in the parish of Saint Andrew. The geological composition of Barbados is of non-volcanic origin and is predominantly composed of  limestone - coral  formed by subduction of the South American plate colliding with the Caribbean plate. The island's climate is  tropical , with constant  trade winds  off the Atlantic Ocean serving to keep temperatures mild. Some less developed areas of the country contain tropical woodland and  mangroves . Other parts of the interior which contribute to the agriculture industry are dotted with large  sugarcane  estates and wide, gently sloping  pastures , with panoramic views down to the coast also.   Barbados's  human development index  ranking is consistently among the top 75 countries in the world. For example, in 2006, it was ranked 31st in the world, and third in the Americas, behind  Canada  and the  United States .

The origin of the name ""Barbados"" is controversial. The  Portuguese , en route to  Brazil  are credited as the first Europeans to discover and name the island. It is a matter of conjecture whether the word ""bearded"" refers to the long, hanging roots of the bearded fig-tree ( Ficus citrifolia ), indigenous to the island, to bearded  Caribs  inhabiting the island, or to the foam spraying over the outlying reefs giving the impression of a beard. In 1519, a map produced by the Genoese mapmaker Vesconte de Maggiola showed and named Barbados in its correct position southeast of the island of  Dominica .   Another name associated with Barbados or her people is ""Bim"" or ""Bimshire"". The origin is uncertain but several theories abound, the  National Cultural Foundation  of Barbados follows the Dr.  Richard Allsopp  theory, which is that ""Bim"" was a word commonly used by slaves and that it derives from the phrase ""bi mu"" [ 3 ]  or either (""bem"", ""Ndi bem"", ""Nwanyi ibem"" or ""Nwoke ibem"") [ 4 ]  from an  Igbo  phrase, meaning ""my people."" In colloquial or literary contexts, ""Bim"" can also take a more deific tone, referring to the ""goddess"" Barbados. [ citation needed ]  The word Bim and Bimshire are recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary and the Chamber's Twentieth Century Dictionaries. Another possible source for ""Bim"" is reported to be in the Agricultural Reporter of 25 April 1868, The Rev. N Greenidge (father of one of the island's most famous scholars, Abel Hendy Jones Greenidge) suggested the listing of Bimshire as a county of England. Expressly named were ""Wiltshire, Hampshire, Berkshire, and Bimshire"". [ 5 ]  Lastly in the Daily Argosy (of Demerara i.e. Guyana) of 1652 it referred to Bim as a possible corruption of the word "" Byam "", who was a Royalist leader against the Parliamentarians. That source suggested the followers of Byam became known as Bims and became a word for all Barbadians. [ 6 ]     [ edit ]   Early history   The first indigenous people are thought to be  Amerindians  who arrived from  Venezuela  around approximately 350-400 B.C. The  Arawak  people were the second wave of migrants, arriving from South America around 800. In the thirteenth century, the Caribs arrived from South America in the third wave, displacing both the Arawak and the Salodoid-Barrancoid culture. For the next few centuries, the Caribs  like the Arawak and the Salodoid-Barrancoid  lived in isolation on the island.   The  Portuguese  then briefly claimed Barbados from the mid-1500s to the 1600s; and may have seized the indigenous  Caribs  on Barbados and used them as  slave labour . Other Caribs are believed to have fled the island to neighbouring islands. Apart from possibly displacing the Caribs, the Portuguese left little impact and by the 1610s, they left for South America, leaving the island uninhabited.     [ edit ]   British colonial rule   British sailors who landed on Barbados in 1625 arrived at the site of present-day  Holetown . From the arrival of the first British settlers in 16271628 until independence in 1966, Barbados was under uninterrupted British control. Nevertheless, Barbados always enjoyed a large measure of local autonomy. Its  House of Assembly  began meeting in 1639. Among the initial important British figures was Sir  William Courten .   With the increased implementation of slave codes, which created differential treatment between Africans and the white workers and planters, the island became increasingly unattractive to  poor whites . Black or slave codes were implemented in 1661, 1676, 1682, and 1688. In response to these codes, several slave rebellions were attempted or planned during this time, but none succeeded. However, an increasingly repressive legal system caused the gap between the treatment of typically white indentured servants and black slaves to widen. Imported slaves became much more attractive for the rich planters who would increasingly dominate the island not only economically but also politically. Some have speculated that, because the Africans could withstand tropical diseases and the climate much better than the white slave population, the white population decreased. This is inconsistent with the fact that many poor whites simply migrated to neighbouring islands and remained in tropical climates. Nevertheless, poor whites who had or acquired the means to emigrate often did so. Planters expanded their importation of African slaves to cultivate sugar cane. The Barbados turned from mainly English and Scots-Irish in the seventeenth century to overwhelmingly black by the end of the 18th century.   Barbados eventually had one of the world's biggest sugar industries after Jews from Brazil introduced the sugarcane to the island in the mid 1600s. This quickly replaced  tobacco  plantations on the islands which were previously the main export. As the  sugar  industry developed into its main commercial enterprise, Barbados was divided into large plantation estates that replaced the smallholdings of the early British settlers. Some of the displaced farmers moved to other British colonies in the Americas, most notably  North  and  South Carolina , and  British Guiana , as well as  Panama . To work the plantations, planters imported enslaved West Africans to Barbados and other Caribbean islands.   The British abolished the  slave trade  in 1807 but not the institution itself. In 1816, slaves arose in the largest major slave rebellion in the island's history. Twenty thousand slaves from over seventy plantations rebelled. They drove whites off the plantations, but widespread killings did not take place. This was later termed Bussa's Rebellion after the slave ranger Bussa, who with his assistants hated slavery, found the treatment of slaves on Barbados to be intolerable, and believed the political climate in the UK made the time ripe to peacefully negotiate with planters for freedom (Davis, p. 211; Northrup, p. 191). Bussa's Rebellion failed. One hundred and twenty slaves died in combat or were immediately executed; another 144 were brought to trial and executed; remaining rebels were shipped off the island (Davis, pp. 212-213).   Slavery was finally abolished in the British Empire eighteen years later in 1834. In Barbados and the rest of the British West Indian colonies, full emancipation from slavery was preceded by an apprenticeship period that lasted four years.          Statue of  Lord Nelson  in  National Heroes Square  which predates the more famous  Nelson's Column  by some 27 years.       In 1884, the Barbados Agricultural Society sent a letter to  Sir Francis Hincks  requesting his private and public views on whether the Dominion of Canada would favourably entertain having the then colony of Barbados admitted as a member of the Canadian Confederation. Asked of  Canada  were the terms of the Canadian side to initiate discussions, and whether or not the island of Barbados could depend on the full influence of Canada in getting the change agreed to by the  United Kingdom . Then in 1952 the  Barbados Advocate  newspaper polled several prominent Barbadian politicians, lawyers, businessmen, the Speaker of the  Barbados House of Assembly  and later as first President of the  Senate , Sir Theodore Branker , Q.C. and found them to be in favour of immediate federation of Barbados along with the rest of the British  Caribbean  with complete Dominion Status within five years from the date of inauguration of the  West Indies Federation  with Canada.   However, plantation owners and merchants of British descent still dominated local politics, owing to the high income qualification required for voting. More than 70% of the population, many of them disenfranchised women, were excluded from the democratic process. It was not until the 1930s that the descendants of emancipated slaves began a movement for political rights. One of the leaders of this movement,  Sir Grantley Adams , founded the  Barbados Labour Party  in 1938, then known as the Barbados Progressive League. While being a staunch supporter of the monarchy, Adams and his party also demanded more rights for the poor and for the people. Progress toward a more democratic government in Barbados was made in 1942, when the exclusive income qualification was lowered and women were given the right to vote. By 1949 governmental control was wrested from the planters and, in 1958, Adams became Premier of Barbados.   From 1958 to 1962, Barbados was one of the ten members of the  West Indies Federation , an organisation doomed by nationalistic attitudes and by the fact that its members, as British colonies, held limited legislative power. Adams served as its first and only ""Premier"", but his leadership failed in attempts to form similar unions, and his continued defence of the monarchy was used by his opponents as evidence that he was no longer in touch with the needs of his country.  Errol Walton Barrow , a fervent reformer, became the new people's advocate. Barrow had left the BLP and formed the  Democratic Labour Party  as a liberal alternative to Adams' conservative government. Barrow instituted many progressive social programmes, such as free education for all Barbadians, and the School Meals system. By 1961, Barrow had replaced Adams as Premier and the DLP controlled the government.   With the Federation dissolved, Barbados had reverted to its former status, that of a  self-governing colony . The island negotiated its own independence at a constitutional conference with the United Kingdom in June 1966. After years of peaceful and democratic progress, Barbados finally became an independent state on 30 November 1966, with Errol Barrow its first Prime Minister. Upon independence Barbados maintained historical linkages with Britain by establishing membership to the  Commonwealth of Nations  grouping, a year later Barbados' International linkages were expanded by obtaining membership to the  United Nations  and the  Organization of American States .     [ edit ]   Government and politics          Parliamentary building.           Main articles:  Politics of Barbados  and  Monarchy of Barbados       Barbados has been an independent country since 30 November 1966. It functions as a  constitutional monarchy  and  parliamentary democracy , modeled on the British  Westminster system , with  Elizabeth II ,  Queen of Barbados , as  head of state  represented locally by the  Governor-General ,  Clifford Husbands  and the  Prime Minister  as the  head of the government . Its  Parliament  comprises thirty seats. It has been proposed that Barbados become a  republic  with a  president  replacing the  Barbadian sovereign ; this issue is still being debated, as the island has been stable and governmentally autonomous for decades.   Barbados is a full and participating member of the  Caribbean Community  (CARICOM), the  Caribbean (CARICOM) Single Market and Economy  (CSME), the  Caribbean Court of Justice  (CCJ), which pertains only to Barbados and  Guyana  but is expected to replace the UK  Privy Council  for the entire English-speaking Caribbean eventually, and the  Association of Caribbean States  (ACS). [ 7 ]   Barbados has a two party system, the two dominant parties being the ruling  Democratic Labour Party  and the  Barbados Labour Party . The Barbados Labour Party (BLP) had been in government for fifteen years, since 1993 until the 2008 general election. Under this administration, the Former Prime Minister, The Right Honourable Owen S. Arthur also acted as the Regional Leader of the CSM (Caribbean Single Market). The Right Honorable David Thompson is the Prime Minister of Barbados. [ 8 ]   On 11 April 2006, the 5-Member  UNCLOS  Annex VII Arbitral Tribunal, presided over by H.E. Judge  Stephen M. Schwebel , rendered after two years of international judicial proceedings, the landmark Barbados/Trinidad and Tobago Award, which resolved the maritime boundary delimitation (in the East, Central and West sectors) to satisfaction of both Parties and committed Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago to resolve their fisheries dispute by means of concluding a new Fisheries Agreement.     [ edit ]   Geography and climate of Barbados       Main article:  Geography and climate of Barbados              Map of Barbados              Beach near  Bridgetown , Barbados.       Barbados is extremely small for a Caribbean island. Relatively flat, it rises gently to the central highland region, the highest point being  Mount Hillaby , in the Scotland District, at 340 meters (1,100 ft) above sea level. The island is located in the Atlantic Ocean, to the east of the other Caribbean islands. The  climate  is tropical, with a rainy season from June to October.   Barbados is often spared the worst effects of the region's tropical storms and  hurricanes  during the rainy season as its far eastern location in the Atlantic Ocean puts it just outside the principal hurricane strike zone, and a hurricane hits about every 26 years. The last significant hit from a hurricane to cause severe damage to Barbados was  Hurricane Janet  in 1955.   In the parish of  Saint Michael  lies Barbados' capital and main city,  Bridgetown . Locally Bridgetown is sometimes referred to as ""The City"", but the most common reference is simply ""Town"". Other towns scattered across the island include  Holetown , in the parish of  Saint James ;  Oistins , in the parish of  Christ Church , and Speightstown, in the parish of  Saint Peter .   It is geologically composed of coral (90 m/300 ft thick). The land falls in a series of ""terraces"" in the west and goes into an incline in the east. Most of Barbados is circled by coral reefs.   The climate is moderate tropical with two seasons: dry and wet. The dry season (DecemberMay) and wet season (JuneNovember) gives an annual rainfall of 40-90 inches (1,0002,300 mm).     [ edit ]   Parishes       Main article:  Parishes of Barbados              Map of the parishes of Barbados       Barbados is  divided  into eleven administrative  parishes :     Christ Church   Saint Andrew   Saint George   Saint James   Saint John   Saint Joseph   Saint Lucy   Saint Michael   Saint Peter   Saint Philip   Saint Thomas       [ edit ]   Economy       Main article:  Economy of Barbados       Historically, the economy of Barbados had been dependent on  sugarcane  cultivation and related activities, but in recent years it has diversified into the  manufacturing  and  tourism  sectors. Offshore finance and information services have become important foreign exchange earners, and there is a healthy light manufacturing sector. In recent years the Government has been seen as business-friendly and economically sound. Since the late 1990s the island has seen a construction boom, with the development and redevelopment of hotels, office complexes, and homes.   The government continues its efforts to reduce  unemployment , encourage direct foreign investment, and privatize remaining state-owned enterprises. Unemployment has been reduced from around 14 percent in the past to under 10 percent.          Circulating  coins  2006       The economy contracted in 2001 and 2002 due to slowdowns in tourism, consumer spending and the impact of the  September 11, 2001 attacks , but rebounded in 2003 and has shown growth since 2004. Traditional trading partners include Canada, the  Caribbean Community  (especially  Trinidad and Tobago ), the United Kingdom and the United States.   Business links and investment flows have become substantial: as of 2003 the island saw from Canada  CA$  25 billion in investment holdings, placing it as one of Canada's top five destinations for Canadian  Foreign Direct Investment  (FDI). Businessman  Eugene Melnyk  of  Toronto , Canada, is said to be Barbados' richest permanent resident.   It was thought by key Barbadian industry sources that the year 2006 would have been one of the busiest years for building construction ever in Barbados, as the building-boom on the island entered the final stages for several multi-million dollar projects. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Transport       Main article:  Transport in Barbados       Transport on the island is good, with 'route taxis', called ""ZR's"" (pronounced "" Zed -Rs"" not ""Zee-Rs""), travelling to most points on the island. These small buses can at times be crowded, as passengers are generally never turned down, regardless of the number. However, they will usually take the more scenic routes to destinations. They generally depart from the capital  Bridgetown  or from  Speightstown  in the northern part of the island.          A  Mini Moke  at  Speightstown  beach       The island of Barbados's lone airport is the  Sir Grantley Adams International Airport (GAIA)  ( IATA  identifier  BGI ). It receives daily flights by several major airlines from points around the globe, as well as several smaller regional commercial airlines and charters. The airport serves as the main air-transportation hub for the Eastern Caribbean. It is undergoing a US$100 million upgrade and expansion.   There are three bus systems running seven days a week (though less frequently on Sundays), and a ride on any of them costs $1.50 BBD. The smaller buses from the two privately-owned systems (""ZRs"" and ""minibuses"") can give change; the larger blue and yellow buses from the government-operated  Barbados Transport Board  system cannot. Most routes require a connection in Bridgetown. Some drivers within the competitive privately owned systems are reluctant to advise persons to use competing services, even if those would be more suitable.   Some hotels also provide visitors with shuttles to points of interest on the island from outside the hotel lobby. There are several locally-owned and -operated vehicle rental agencies in Barbados but there are no multi-national car-rental agencies such as Avis, Europcar or Hertz.   There is also a helicopter shuttle service, which offers air taxi services to a number of sites around the island, mainly on the West Coast tourist belt. Air and water traffic is regulated by the  Barbados Port Authority .     [ edit ]   Tourist information   The island is well developed, and there are internationally known hotels offering world-class accommodation. Time-shares are available, and many of the smaller local hotels and private villas which dot the island have space available if booked in advance. The southern and western coasts of Barbados are popular, with the calm light blue Atlantic Ocean and their fine white and pinkish sandy beaches. Along the island's east coast the Atlantic Ocean side are tumbling waves which are perfect for light  surfing , but a little bit risky due to under-tow currents.   Shopping  districts are popular in Barbados, with ample duty-free shopping. There is also a festive night-life in mainly tourist areas such as the  Saint Lawrence Gap . Other attractions include wildlife reserves, jewelery stores,  scuba diving , helicopter rides,  golf ,  festivals  (the largest being the annual crop over festival July/Aug), sightseeing, cave exploration, exotic  drinks  and fine  clothes   shopping .     [ edit ]   Attractions, landmarks and points of interest   Tourism accounts for almost one half of the economy.

Close to 90% of all Barbadians (also known colloquially as  Bajan ) are of  African  descent (""Afro-Bajans""). A mix of many African ethnicities, notably the  Igbo ,  Akan  and  Yoruba people , they are mostly descendants of the  slave  labourers on the sugar plantations. The remainder of the population includes groups of Europeans (""Anglo-Bajans"" / ""Euro-Bajans"") mainly from the  United Kingdom , the  Republic of Ireland , Chinese locally known as Bajan-Chiney, Bajan Hindus from  India  and Muslims from  Bangladesh  and  Pakistan , and an influential ""Arab-Bajans"" group mainly of Christian  Syrians  and  Lebanese  descent. On the island are many people of  Creole  descent, a mixture of Afro-Caribbean and European descent (Primarily British, Irish and  Portuguese ).   Other groups in Barbados include people from the  United Kingdom ,  United States  and  Canada . Barbadians who return after years of residence in the U.S. are called ""Bajan Yankees""; this term is considered derogatory by some.   The country's official language is English, the local dialect of which is referred to as  Bajan , spoken by most. In religion, most Barbadians are  Christians  (67%), chiefly of the  Anglican Church , but there are Protestant,  Roman Catholic ,  Jehovah's Witness ,  Hindu ,  Muslim  and  Jewish  minorities. Barbados is a chief destination for emigrants from the South American nation of  Guyana . The biggest communities outside the Afro-Caribbean community are:     The  Indo-Guyanese , an important part of the economy due to the increase of immigrants from partner country  Guyana . There are reports of a growing Indo-Bajan diaspora originating from Guyana and  India . They introduced soca-chutney ,  roti  and many Indian dishes to Barbados' culture. Mostly from southern India and Hindu states, these 'Desi' peoples are growing in size but smaller than the equivalent communities in Trinidad & Guyana; Hinduism is one of Barbados' growing religions.   Euro-Bajans (4% of the population) [ 10 ]  have settled in Barbados since the 1500s, originating from  England , Portugal, Ireland and  Scotland . In 1643, there were 37,200 whites in Barbados (86% of the population). [ 11 ]  More commonly they are known as "" White Bajans "", although some carry Afro-Caribbean traces and vice-versa. Euro-Bajans introduced folk music, such as  Irish music  and Highland music, and certain place names, such as ""Scotland"", a mountainous region, and ""Trafalgar Square"" in Bridgetown, now renamed ""Heroes Square"". Among White Barbadians there exists an underclass known as  Redlegs ; the descendants of  indentured servants , and prisoners imported to the island. [ 12 ]   Chinese -Barbadians (or, as they are known on the island, ""Bajan-Chineys"") are a small portion of Barbados' Asian demographics, smaller than the equivalent communities of  Jamaica  and  Trinidad . Most if not all first arrived in the 1940s during the Second World War, originating mainly from the then British territory of  Hong Kong . Many Chinese-Bajans have the surnames Chin, Chynn or Lee, although other surnames prevail in certain areas of the island. Chinese food and culture is becoming part of everyday Bajan culture.   Lebanese and Syrians form the Middle Eastern community on the island and make up 89% of the Muslim population. Middle-Eastern Barbadians are often perceived to be the most successful group in business, along with the Chinese Bajans. During the  Arab Israeli Wars , many Syrians and Lebanese headed for the West Indies to escape conflict and poverty in the  Middle East . [ citation needed ]  Also Jewish people arrived in Barbados around the same time, creating the biggest synagogue in the West Indies.   Latin Americans have been migrating to the island since the 18th century, due to the close proximity of  South America , many  Venezuelans  had migrated to Barbados as labourers via Trinidad.  Brazilian Jews ,  Colombians  and  Panamanians  also live on the island. The Spanish language is now being encouraged to be taught as a second language in Barbadian schools over French.       [ edit ]   Culture          Banks beer at dusk           Main article:  Culture of Barbados     See also:  Music of Barbados     The influence of the English on Barbados is more noticeable than on other islands in the West Indies. A good example of this is the island's national sport:  cricket . Barbados has brought forth several great cricketers, including  Garfield Sobers  and  Frank Worrell .   Citizens are officially called Barbadians; Barbados' residents, however, colloquially refer to themselves or the products of the country as ""Bajan"". The term ""Bajan"" may have come from a localized pronunciation of the word Barbadian which at times can sound more like ""Bar-bajan"".   The largest  carnival -like cultural event which takes place on the island is the  Crop Over  festival. As in many other Caribbean and Latin American countries,  Crop Over  is an important event for many people on the island, as well as the thousands of tourists that flock to the island to participate in the annual events. The festival includes musical competitions and other traditional activities. It gets under way from the beginning of July, and ends with the costumed parade on Kadooment Day, held on the first Monday of August.   Barbados retains a strong British influence and is referred to by its neighbours as ""Little England"".     [ edit ]   Sports in Barbados     See also:  Cricket in the West Indies     As in other Caribbean countries of British descent,  cricket  is a favourite sport. In addition to several warm-up matches and six ""Super Eight"" matches, Barbados hosted the final of the  2007 Cricket World Cup .   In  golf , the  Barbados Open  is an annual stop on the  European Seniors Tour . In December 2006 the  WGC-World Cup  took place at the country's  Sandy Lane  resort on the Country Club course, an eighteen-hole course designed by  Tom Fazio .   Motorsports also play a role, with Rally Barbados occurring each summer and currently being listed on the FIA NACAM calendar.   Basketball  is a popular sport played at school or college and is increasing in popularity as is  volleyball , though volleyball is mainly played inside. At certain beaches such as Brandons beach in St. Michael people do get together to play  beach volleyball .   Other sports played include  hockey ,  table tennis ,  road tennis ,  football ,  rugby ,  polo  and  swimming .   Netball  is also popular with women in Barbados.     [ edit ]   National symbols     [ edit ]   Flower          A yellow and red Pride of Barbados ( Caesalpinia pulcherrima ).       The national flower is the Pride of Barbados or  Caesalpinia pulcherrima  (L.) Sw., which grows across the island.     [ edit ]   Flag   The tridented centered within the flag is a representation of the mythological Neptune, god of the sea. The trident in its original unbroken form was taken from the former colonial seal, which itself was replaced by the current coat of arms. Used within the national flag, the left and right shafts of the trident were then designed as 'broken' representing the nation of Barbados breaking away from its historical and constitutional ties as a former colony.   The three points of the  trident  represent in Barbados the three principles of  democracy  - ""government of, for and by the people."" The broken trident is set in a centered vertical band of gold representing the sands of Barbados' beaches. The gold band itself is surrounded on both sides by vertical bands of ultramarine (blue) representing the sea and sky of Barbados.   The design for the flag was created by Grantley W. Prescod and was chosen from an open competition arranged by the Barbados government. Over a thousand entries were received. [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   Golden Shield   The Golden Shield in the coat of arms carries two "" Pride of Barbados "" flowers and the ""bearded"" fig tree ( Ficus citrifolia  or  Ficus barbata ), which was common on the island at the time of its settlement by the British and may have contributed to Barbados being so named.     [ edit ]   Coat of arms   The  coat of arms  depicts two animals which are supporting the shield. On the left is a "" dolphin fish "", symbolic of the fishing industry and seagoing past of Barbados. On the right is a  pelican , symbolic of a small island named  Pelican Island  that once existed off the coast of Bridgetown. Above the shield is the helmet of Barbados with an extended arm clutching two  sugar-cane  stalks. The ""cross"" formation made by the cane stalks represents the saltire cross upon which  Saint Andrew  was crucified. On the base of the Coat of Arms reads ""Pride and Industry"" in reference to the country's motto.     [ edit ]   National heroes       Main article:  Barbadian national heroes       On April 1998, the Order of National Heroes Act was passed by the  Parliament of Barbados . According to the government, the act established that 28 April (the centenary of the birth of Sir Grantley Adams) would be celebrated as  National Heroes' Day . The act also declared that there are ten national heroes of Barbados. All of which would be elevated to the title of the The Right Excellent. [ 14 ]   The ten official National Heroes of Barbados are:-     Bussa  ( - 1816)   Sarah Ann Gill  (1795 - 1866)   Samuel Jackman Prescod  (1806 - 1871)   Dr. Charles Duncan ONeal  (1879 - 1936)   Clement Osbourne Payne  (1904 - 1941)   Sir Grantley Herbert Adams  (1898 - 1987)   Rt.

The origin of the name "" Barbados "" is controversial. The  Portuguese , en route to  Brazil  are credited as the first European nation to discover and name the island. They dubbed the island  Os Barbados,  which was Portuguese for  the Bearded Ones . It is a matter of conjecture whether the word ""bearded"" refers to the long, hanging roots of the bearded fig-tree ( Ficus citrifolia ), indigenous to the island, to bearded  Caribs  inhabiting the island, or to the foam spraying over the outlying reefs giving the impression of a beard. In 1519, a map produced by the Genoese mapmaker Vesconte de Maggiola showed and named Barbados in its correct position north of the island of  Tobago . On some historic maps the island has also been spelled as Barbadoes.     [ edit ]   Early history       Main article:  Early history of Barbados       New archaeological discoveries suggest that  Barbados  may have been inhabited as early as some time in the 1600s. B.C. [ 1 ]  Better known, is the migration of the  Amerindians  who traveled across this part of the  Atlantic Ocean  by canoe from the  Orinoco  River region of  Venezuela .   This was followed by the  Arawak  Indians who first arrived in the island around 350-400 BC. A few historical remains of their settlement have been found in areas of Silver Sands,  Stroud Point , Chancery Lane, Pie Corner,  Saint Luke's Gully  and  Mapp's Cave . They were then conquered by the  Caribs , as evidenced by a dramatic decline in their population around 1200 AD. The Caribs later disappeared from the island. While no direct cause has been determined, a possible combination of famine, disease, abduction and enslavement in larger islands by the Spanish or Portuguese have all been suggested as probable causes.   Of especial note are the Portuguese, who visited the island briefly while en route to  Brazil , that are responsible for leaving behind the wild pigs that would greet the first British settlers.     [ edit ]   Early British Colonization   The British found the island uninhabited when they first arrived in 1625 and claimed it in the name of  King James I . This first ship, which arrived on May 14, was captained by John Powell. The first settlement landed some time later on February 17, 1627 near what is now Holetown (formerly Jamestown). The group was lead by Captain John Powell, who arrived with 80 settlers and 10 black slaves. This settlement was funded by Sir  William Courteen , a London merchant who owned the title to Barbados and several other unclaimed islands. Thus, the first colonists were actually tenants and the profits of their labour returned to Courteen and his company.   Courteen would later lose this title to  James Hay, 1st Earl of Carlisle  in what was called the ""Great Barbados Robbery."" Carlisle then chose as governor  Henry Hawley . It was he who established the House of Assembly in  1639 , in an effort to appease the planters who might otherwise oppose his controversial appointment.   In the very early years, the majority of the population was white and male, with African slaves providing little of the workforce. Cultivation of tobacco, cotton, ginger and indigo was handled primarily by European indentured labour until the start of the  sugar cane  industry.     [ edit ]   Sugar Cane and Slavery       Main article:  Slavery in the British and French Caribbean       Sugar cane cultivation began in the  1640s , after its introduction in 1637 by Pieter Blower. Initially, rum was produced but by 1642,  sugar  was the focus of the industry. As it developed into the main commercial enterprise, Barbados was divided into large plantation estates which replaced the small holdings of the early British settlers as the wealthy planters pushed out the poorer. Some of the displaced farmers relocated to British colonies in North America, most notably  South Carolina . To work the plantations, tribal peoples of Africa were imported as slaves in such numbers that there were three for every one planter. The slave trade ceased a few years before the abolition of slavery throughout the British empire in  1834 . Persecuted Catholics from Ireland also worked the plantations.   Sugar cane  dominated Barbados' economic growth, and the island's  cash crop  was at the top of the sugar industry until  1720 . The  1907   Nuttall Encyclopedia  reports the island's population as 182,000.   Gypsies purged from Europe and other captured nomads were also brought to Barbados as slaves. The Europeans mixed these groups in with the existing groups to form servants for export to the Americas, particularly to the plantations owned by President Thomas Jefferson. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Political development   From 1800 until 1885 Barbados then served as the main seat of Government for the former  British  colonies of the  Windward Islands . During the period of around 85 years the resident  Governor of Barbados  also served as the  Colonial head of the Windward Islands . After the Government of Barbados officially exited from the Windward Island union in 1885, the seat was moved from Bridgetown to  St. George's  on the neighbouring island of  Grenada , where it remained until the territory of the Windward Islands was desolved.   Soon after Barbados' withdrawal from the Windward Islands, Barbados became aware that  Tobago  was going to be amalgamated with another territory as part of a single state. In response, Barbados made an official bid to the British Government to have neighbouring Island Tobago joined with Barbados as a political union. The British government however decided that Trinidad would be a better fit and Tobago instead was made a Ward of Trinidad.   Local enslaved people of Africa and Ireland worked for the merchants of British descent. It was these merchants who continued to dominate politically even after emancipation, due to a high income restriction on voting. Only an exclusive 30%, therefore, had any voice in the democratic process. It was not until the 1930s that a movement for political rights was begun by the descendants of emancipated slaves, who started  trade unions . One of the leaders of this movement, Sir  Grantley Adams , founded the  Barbados Progressive League  (now the  Barbados Labour Party ) in  1938 .  The Great Depression  caused mass unemployment and  strikes , and the quality of life on the island lowered drastically. Despite his loyalty to the British Crown (a trait which would later become his downfall), Adams wanted more for the people, especially the poor.   Finally, in  1942 , the income qualification was lowered. This was followed by the introduction of universal adult suffrage in  1951 , with Adams elected the Premier of Barbados in  1958 . For his actions, Adams would later become a National Hero.   From  1958  to  1962 , Barbados was one of the ten members of the  West Indies Federation , an organisation doomed to failure by a number of factors, including what were often petty nationalistic prejudices and limited legislative power. Indeed, Adams' position as ""Prime Minister"" is a gross misnomer, as all of the Federation members were still colonies of Britain. Adams, once a political visionary and now a man blind to the needs of his country, not only held fast to his out-dated notion of defending the monarchy but also made additional attempts to form similarly flawed Federation-like entities after that union's demise. When the Federation was terminated, Barbados had reverted to its former status as a  self-governing colony , but efforts were made by Adams to form another federation composed of Barbados and the Leeward and Windward Islands.   Errol Walton Barrow  was to replace Grantley Adams as the people's advocate and it was he who would eventually lead the island into Independence. Barrow, a fervent reformer and once a member of the BLP, had left the party to form his own  Democratic Labour Party , as the liberal alternative to the conservative BLP government under Adams. He remains a national hero for his work in social reformation, including the institution of free education for all Barbadians. In  1961 , Barrow supplanted Adams as Premier as the DLP took control of the government.   Due to several years of growing autonomy, Barbados was able to successfully negotiate its own independence at a constitutional conference with the United Kingdom in June  1966 . After years of peaceful and democratic progress, Barbados finally became an independent state within the  Commonwealth of Nations  on  November 30 ,  1966 , with Errol Barrow serving as its first Prime Minister.

The South African coast stretches 2,798 kilometres (1,739 mi) [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  and borders both the  Atlantic  and  Indian   oceans . [ 7 ]  To the north of South Africa lie  Namibia ,  Botswana ,  Zimbabwe ,  Mozambique  and  Swaziland , while the  Kingdom of Lesotho  is an independent  enclave  surrounded by South African territory. [ 8 ]   Modern human beings have inhabited South Africa for more than 100,000 years. [ 9 ]  A century and a half after the discovery of the  Cape Sea Route , the  Dutch East India Company   founded  a refreshment station at what would become  Cape Town  in 1652. [ 10 ]  Cape Town became a British colony in 1806. European settlement expanded during the 1820s as the  Boers  (original  Dutch ,  Flemish ,  German  and  French  settlers) and the British  1820 Settlers  claimed land in the north and east of the country. Conflicts arose among the Xhosa, Zulu and Afrikaner groups. However, the discovery of diamonds and later gold triggered the conflict known as the  Anglo-Boer War  as the Boers and the British fought for the control of the South African mineral wealth. Although the Boers were defeated, limited independence was given to South Africa in 1910 as a British dominion. Anti-British policies focused on ultimate independence which was achieved in 1961 when South Africa was declared a  republic . The leading  National Party  legislated for a continuation of racial segregation begun under Dutch and British colonial rule, Boer republics, and subsequent South African governments (and which in 1948 became legally institutionalized  segregation  known as  apartheid ), despite opposition both in and outside of the country. In 1990 the then president  F.W. de Klerk  began to dismantle this legislation, and in 1994 the first democratic election was held in South Africa. This election brought  Nelson Mandela  and the current ruling party, the  African National Congress  to power, and the country rejoined the  Commonwealth of Nations .   South Africa is known for its diversity in cultures, languages, and religious beliefs, and eleven official languages are recognised in its  constitution . [ 7 ]  English is the most commonly spoken language in official and commercial public life, however it is only the fifth most spoken home language. [ 7 ]  South Africa is ethnically diverse, with the largest  Caucasian ,  Indian , and  racially mixed  communities in Africa. Although 79.6% of the South African population is  Black , [ 2 ]  this category is neither culturally nor linguistically homogenous, as people within this classification speak a number of different  Bantu languages , nine of which have official status. [ 7 ]  Midyear 2007, the South African population was estimated at 47.9 million.

(September 2008)           Main article:  History of South Africa       South Africa contains some of the oldest archaeological sites in the world. [ 11 ]   [ 12 ]  Extensive fossil remains at the  Sterkfontein ,  Kromdraai  and Makapansgat caves suggest that various  australopithecines  existed in South Africa from about three million years ago. [ 13 ]  These were succeeded by various species of  Homo , including  Homo habilis ,  Homo erectus  and modern humans,  Homo sapiens . Settlements of  Bantu -speaking peoples, who were  iron -using agriculturists and herdsmen, were already present south of the  Limpopo River  by the fourth or fifth century (see  Bantu expansion ) displacing and absorbing the original  KhoiSan  speakers. They slowly moved south and the earliest ironworks in modern-day  KwaZulu-Natal Province  are believed to date from around 1050. The southernmost group was the  Xhosa  people, whose language incorporates certain linguistic traits from the earlier KhoiSan people, reaching the  Fish River , in today's  Eastern Cape Province . These  Iron Age  populations displaced earlier people, who often had  hunter-gatherer  societies, as they migrated.     European colonisation          Painting of an account of the arrival of  Jan van Riebeeck , the first  European  to settle in South Africa, with  Devil's Peak  in the background       In 1487, the  Portuguese  explorer  Bartolomeu Dias  became the first European to reach the southernmost point of Africa. Initially named The Cape of Storms, The King of Portugal,  John II , renamed it the  Cabo da Boa Esperana  or  Cape of Good Hope  as it led to the riches of India. This great feat of navigation was later immortalized in  Cames ' epic Portuguese poem,  The Lusiads  (1572). In 1652, a refreshment station was established at the  Cape of Good Hope  by  Jan van Riebeeck  on behalf of the  Dutch East India Company .  Slaves  were brought from  Indonesia ,  Madagascar , and India as a labour source for the Dutch immigrants in  Cape Town . As they expanded east, the Dutch settlers eventually met the south-westerly expanding  Xhosa  people in the region of the  Fish River . A series of wars, called the  Cape Frontier Wars , ensued, mainly caused by conflicting land and livestock interests.   Great Britain  took over the  Cape of Good Hope  area in 1795 ostensibly to stop it falling into the hands of the Revolutionary French, but also seeking to use  Cape Town  in particular as a stop on the route to Australia and India. It was later returned to the Dutch in 1803, but soon afterwards the  Dutch East India Company  declared bankruptcy, and the British annexed the Cape Colony in 1806. The British continued the frontier wars against the Xhosa, pushing the eastern frontier eastward through a line of forts established along the Fish River and consolidating it by encouraging  British settlement . Due to pressure of  abolitionist  societies in Britain, the  British parliament  first stopped its global  slave trade  with the passage of the  Slave Trade Act 1807 , then abolished slavery in all its colonies with the  Slavery Abolition Act 1833 . During the 1830s, approximately 12 000  Boers  (later known as  Voortrekkers ), departed from the  Cape Colony , where they were subjected to British control, to the future Natal, Orange Free State and Transvaal regions. The Boers founded the  Boer Republics  - the  South African Republic  (Now  Gauteng ,  Limpopo ,  Mpumalanga  and  North West  provinces) and the  Orange Free State  ( Free State ).   The discovery of  diamonds  in 1867 and  gold  in 1884 in the interior encouraged economic growth and immigration, intensifying the subjugation of the indigenous people. These important economic resources did not only play a role between European and the indigenous population but also between the Boers and the British. [ 14 ]   The  Boer Republics  successfully resisted British encroachments during the  First Boer War  (18801881) using  guerrilla warfare  tactics, much better suited to local conditions. However, the British returned in greater numbers, more experience, and more suitable tactics in the  Second Boer War  (18991902). The Boers' attempt to ally themselves with  German South-West Africa  provided the British with yet another excuse to take control of the Boer Republics. [ citation needed ]           Boers  in combat (1881).         Independence   After four years of negotiating, the  Union of South Africa  was created from the  Cape  and  Natal  colonies, as well as the republics of  Orange Free State  and  Transvaal , on 31 May 1910, exactly eight years after the end of the Second Boer War. The newly created Union of South Africa was a  dominion . The  Natives' Land Act  of 1913 severely restricted the ownership of land by 'blacks', at that stage to a mere 7% of the country, although this amount was eventually increased marginally. [ 15 ]  The union was effectively granted independence from the United Kingdom with the passage of the  Statute of Westminster , which morphed the  British king's  position within South Africa into that of the distinct  King of South Africa . In 1934, the  South African Party  and  National Party  merged to form the  United Party , seeking reconciliation between Afrikaners and English-speaking ""Whites"", but split in 1939 over the entry of the Union into  World War II  as an ally of the United Kingdom, a move which the National Party strongly opposed.   In 1948, the  National Party  was elected to power, and intensified the implementation of racial segregation that had begun under Dutch and British colonial rule, and subsequent South African governments since the Union was formed. The Nationalist Government systematised existing segregationist laws, and the system of segregation became known collectively as  apartheid . Not surprisingly, this segregation also applied to the wealth acquired during rapid industrialisation of the 1950s, '60s, and '70s. While the White minority enjoyed the highest  standard of living  in all of Africa, often comparable to  First World  western nations, the Black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard, including income, education, housing, and life expectancy. On 31 May 1961, following a whites-only  referendum , the country became a  republic  and left the (British)  Commonwealth . The office of  Governor-General  was abolished and replaced with the position of  State President .   Apartheid became increasingly controversial, leading to widespread  sanctions ,  divestment  and growing unrest and oppression within South Africa. (See also the article on the  History of South Africa in the apartheid era .) A long period of harsh suppression by the government, and at times violent resistance,  strikes , marches, protests, and  sabotage  by bombing and other means, by various anti-apartheid movements, most notably the  African National Congress  (ANC), followed. In the late 1970s, South Africa began a programme of  nuclear weapons  development and in the following decade it produced six deliverable nuclear weapons. The rationale for the nuclear arsenal is disputed, but it is believed [ who? ]  that  Vorster  and  P.W. Botha  wanted to be able to catalyse American intervention in the event of a war between South Africa and the  Cuban -supported  MPLA  government of  Angola .     Democracy   In 1990 the  National Party  government took the first step towards negotiating itself out of power when it lifted the ban on the  African National Congress  and other  left-wing  political organisations, and released  Nelson Mandela  from prison after twenty-seven years' incarceration on a  sabotage  sentence. Apartheid legislation was gradually removed from the statute books, and South Africa also destroyed its nuclear arsenal and acceded to the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . The first  multi-racial elections  were held in 1994, which the ANC won by an overwhelming majority. It has been in power ever since.   In  post-apartheid South Africa , millions of South Africans, mostly black, continued to live in  poverty , though poverty among whites, previously rare, has increased greatly. [ 16 ]  While some have partly attributed this to the legacy of the apartheid system, increasingly many attribute it to the failure of the current government to tackle social issues, coupled with the monetary and fiscal discipline of the current government to ensure both redistribution of wealth and economic growth. Since the ANC-led government took power, the  United Nations   Human Development Index  of South Africa has fallen, while it was steadily rising until the mid-1990s. [ 17 ]  Some of this could possibly be attributed to the  AIDS   pandemic  and the failure of the government to take steps to address it, [ 18 ] some of it can also be pinpointed to a government policy of  redistribution of wealth . As a mitigating factor, the social housing policy of the current government has produced an improvement in living conditions.     Politics       Main articles:  Politics of South Africa ,  Government of South Africa , and  Law of South Africa              The  Union Buildings  in  Pretoria  is the home of the South African executive.       South Africa has three capital cities:  Cape Town , the largest of the three, is the  legislative  capital;  Pretoria  is the  administrative  capital; and  Bloemfontein  is the  judicial  capital. South Africa has a  bicameral   parliament : the  National Council of Provinces  (the  upper house ) has 90 members, while the  National Assembly  (the  lower house ) has 400 members. Members of the lower house are elected on a population basis by  proportional representation : half of the members are elected from national lists and the other half are elected from provincial lists. Ten members are elected to represent each province in the National Council of Provinces, regardless of the population of the province. Elections for both chambers are held every five years. The government is formed in the lower house, and the leader of the majority party in the National Assembly is the  President .   The primary sources of South Africa law are Roman-Dutch mercantile law and personal law with English Common law, as imports of Dutch settlements and  British colonialism . [ 19 ]  The first European based law in South Africa was brought by the  Dutch East India Company  and is called  Roman-Dutch law . It was imported before the  codification  of European law into the  Napoleonic Code  and is comparable in many ways to  Scots law . This was followed in the 19th century by  English law , both  common  and  statutory . Starting in 1910 with unification, South Africa had its own  parliament  which passed laws specific for South Africa, building on those previously passed for the individual member colonies.   Current South African politics are dominated by the  African National Congress  (ANC), which received 69.7% of the vote during the last  2004 general election  and 66.3% of the vote in the  2006 municipal election . The current  President of South Africa  is  Kgalema Motlanthe , who replaced  Thabo Mbeki  on 25 September 2008. Mbeki succeeded former President  Nelson Mandela  in 1999, and was re-elected for a second five year term in 2004, but announced his resignation on 20 September 2008.   The main challenger to the rule of the ANC is the  Democratic Alliance  party, which received 12.4% of the vote in the 2004 election and 14.8% in the 2006 election.  Helen Zille , (elected 6 May 2007), is the party leader; the previous leader was  Tony Leon . The formerly dominant  New National Party , which introduced apartheid through its predecessor, the  National Party , chose to merge with the ANC on 9 April 2005. Other major political parties represented in Parliament are the  Inkatha Freedom Party , which mainly represents  Zulu  voters, and the  Independent Democrats , who took 6.97% and 1.7% of the vote respectively, in the 2004 election.   Since 2004, the country has had many thousands of popular protests, some violent, making it, according to one academic, the ""most protest-rich country in the world"". [ 20 ]  Many of these protests have been organised from the growing  shanty towns  that surround South African cities.     Foreign relations and military       Main articles:  South African National Defence Force ,  Foreign relations of South Africa , and  South Africa and weapons of mass destruction       Since the end of apartheid, the South African foreign policy has focused on its African partners particularly in the  Southern African Development Community  (SADC) and the  African Union . South Africa has played a key role as a mediator in African conflicts over the last decade, such as in  Burundi , the  Democratic Republic of Congo , the  Comoros , and  Zimbabwe . After apartheid ended, South Africa was readmitted to the  Commonwealth of Nations . As the  Union of South Africa , South Africa was a founding member of the  United Nations  and the then Prime Minister  Jan Smuts  wrote the preamble to its constitution. South Africa is currently a non-permanent member of the  United Nations Security Council  and has attracted controversy by voting against a resolution criticising the  Burmese  government in 2006 and against the implementation of sanctions against  Zimbabwe  in 2008. South Africa is a member of the  Group of 77  and chaired the organisation in 2006. South Africa is a member of the  South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone ,  Southern African Customs Union ,  World Trade Organization ,  International Monetary Fund ,  G20  and  G8+5 .   The South African  armed forces , known as the  South African National Defence Force  (SANDF), was created in 1994. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  Previously known as the  South African Defence Force  (SADF), the new force is an all volunteer army and consists of the forces of the old SADF, as well as the forces of the African nationalist groups, namely  Umkhonto we Sizwe  (MK),  Azanian People's Liberation Army  (APLA), and the former  Bantustan  defence forces. [ 21 ]  The SANDF is subdivided into four branches, the  South African Army , the  South African Air Force , the  South African Navy , and the  South African Military Health Services . [ 23 ]   In recent years, the SANDF has become a major  peacekeeping  force in Africa, [ 24 ]  and has been involved in operations in  Lesotho , the  Democratic Republic of the Congo , [ 24 ]  and  Burundi , [ 24 ]  amongst others. It has also participated as a part of multi-national  UN  peacekeeping forces.   South Africa undertook a nuclear weapons programme in the 1970s [ 25 ]  and  may have conducted  a nuclear test over the  Atlantic  in 1979. [ 26 ]  It is the only African country to have successfully  developed nuclear weapons . It has become the first country (followed by Ukraine) with nuclear capability to voluntarily renounce and dismantle its programme and in the process signed the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty  in 1991. [ 25 ]     Provinces, districts and municipalities       Main articles:  Provinces of South Africa ,  Districts of South Africa , and  Municipalities of South Africa              Map showing the provinces and districts (numbered) of South Africa.             Northern Cape          North West          Gauteng          Limpopo          Mpumalanga            KwaZulu-Natal          Eastern Cape          Free State          Western Cape               When apartheid ended in 1994, the South African government had to integrate the formerly independent and semi-independent  Bantustans  into the political structure of South Africa. To this end, it abolished the four former provinces of South Africa ( Cape Province ,  Natal ,  Orange Free State , and  Transvaal ) and replaced them with nine fully integrated provinces. The new provinces are usually much smaller than the former provinces, which theoretically gives local governments more resources to distribute over smaller areas.   The nine provinces are further subdivided into  52 districts :  6 metropolitan  and  46 district municipalities . The 46 district municipalities are further subdivided into  231 local municipalities . The district municipalities also contain 20 district management areas (mostly game parks) that are directly governed by the district municipalities. The six metropolitan municipalities perform the functions of both district and local municipalities. The new provinces are:       Province   Former homelands and provinces   Capital   Area (km)   Area (sq mi)   Population (2001)       Eastern Cape   Cape Province ,  Transkei ,  Ciskei   Bhisho   169,580   65,475   6,436,761       Free State   Orange Free State ,  QwaQwa   Bloemfontein   129,480   49,992   2,706,776       Gauteng   Transvaal   Johannesburg   17,010   6,568   8,837,172       KwaZulu-Natal   Natal ,  KwaZulu   Pietermaritzburg   92,100   35,560   9,426,018       Limpopo   Transvaal ,  Venda ,  Lebowa ,  Gazankulu   Polokwane   123,900   47,838   5,273,637       Mpumalanga   Transvaal ,  KwaNdebele ,  KaNgwane ,  Bophuthatswana ,  Lebowa   Nelspruit   79,490   30,691   3,122,994       Northern Cape   Cape Province   Kimberley   361,830   139,703   822,726       North West   Transvaal ,  Cape Province ,  Bophuthatswana   Mafikeng   116,320   44,911   3,669,349       Western Cape   Cape Province   Cape Town   129,370   49,950   4,524,335       Total   1,219,080   470,688   44,819,768         Geography       Main article:  Geography of South Africa              Map of South Africa       South Africa is located at the southernmost region of Africa, with a long  coastline  that stretches more than 2,500 kilometres (1,550 mi) and across two  oceans  (the South  Atlantic  and the  Indian ). At 470,979  sq mi  (1,219,912 km), [ 27 ]  South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world (after  Mali ). It is comparable in size to  Colombia .  Njesuthi  in the  Drakensberg  at 3,408 m (11,424 ft) is the highest peak in South Africa.          View of the  Drakensberg mountains , the highest mountain range in South Africa.       South Africa has a generally  temperate climate , due in part to it being surrounded by the  Atlantic  and  Indian Oceans  on three sides, by its location in the climatically milder  southern hemisphere  and due to the average elevation rising steadily towards the north (towards the  equator ) and further inland. Due to this varied topography and oceanic influence, a great variety of climatic zones exist.   The climatic zones vary, from the extreme  desert  of the southern  Namib  in the farthest northwest to the lush  subtropical  climate in the east along the  Mozambique  border and the  Indian  ocean. From the east, the land quickly rises over a  mountainous   escarpment  towards the interior  plateau  known as the  Highveld . Even though South Africa is classified as  semi-arid , there is considerable variation in  climate  as well as  topography .   The interior of South Africa is a vast, rather flat, and sparsely populated  scrubland ,  Karoo , which is drier towards the northwest along the Namib desert. In contrast, the eastern coastline is lush and well-watered, which produces a climate similar to the tropics. The extreme southwest has a climate remarkably similar to that of the  Mediterranean  with wet winters and hot, dry summers, hosting the famous  Fynbos   Biome . This area also produces much of the  wine  in South Africa. This region is also particularly known for its wind, which blows intermittently almost all year. The severity of this wind made passing around the  Cape of Good Hope  particularly treacherous for sailors, causing many  shipwrecks . Further east on the south coast, rainfall is distributed more evenly throughout the year, producing a green landscape. This area is popularly known as the  Garden Route .          Satellite picture of South Africa       The  Free State  is particularly flat due to the fact that it lies centrally on the high plateau. North of the  Vaal River , the Highveld becomes better watered and does not experience subtropical extremes of heat.  Johannesburg , in the centre of the Highveld, is at 1,740 metres (5,709 ft) and receives an annual rainfall of 760 millimetres (30  in ). Winters in this region are cold, although  snow  is rare.   To the north of Johannesburg, the altitude drops beyond the escarpment of the Highveld, and turns into the lower lying Bushveld, an area of mixed dry forest and an abundance of wildlife. East of the Highveld, beyond the eastern escarpment, the Lowveld stretches towards the  Indian  ocean. It has particularly high temperatures, and is also the location of extended subtropical agriculture.   The high  Drakensberg mountains , which form the south-eastern escarpment of the Highveld, offer limited  skiing  opportunities in winter. The coldest place in South Africa is  Sutherland  in the western  Roggeveld Mountains , where midwinter temperatures can reach as low as 15 degrees  Celsius  (5  F ). The deep interior has the hottest temperatures: A temperature of 51.7 C (125 F) was recorded in 1948 in the  Northern Cape  Kalahari near  Upington . [ 28 ]   South Africa also has one possession, the small sub-Antarctic archipelago of the  Prince Edward Islands , consisting of  Marion Island  (290 km/112 sq mi) and Prince Edward Island (45 km/17.3 sq mi) (not to be confused with the  Canadian province of the same name ).           Weather averages for Cape Town, South Africa         Month   Jan   Feb   Mar   Apr   May   Jun   Jul   Aug   Sep   Oct   Nov   Dec   Year       Average high C (F)   27  (81)   28  (82)   26  (79)   24  (75)   20  (68)   18  (64)   17  (63)   18  (64)   19  (66)   22  (72)   24  (75)   26  (79)   28  (82)       Average low C (F)   16  (61)   16  (61)   15  (59)   13  (55)   10  (50)   8  (46)   8  (46)   8  (46)   9  (48)   11  (52)   14  (57)   15  (59)   8  (46)       Precipitation  mm (inches)   16.5  (0.65)   13  (0.51)   20  (0.79)   54  (2.13)   92  (3.62)   111  (4.37)   96  (3.78)   87  (3.43)   56  (2.2)   40  (1.57)   24  (0.94)   18  (0.71)   627  (24.69)       Source: EuroWEATHER [ 29 ]  2008-02-22         Flora and fauna     See also:  Wildlife of South Africa   See also:  Protected areas of South Africa             Fynbos , a  floral kingdom  unique to South Africa, is found near  Cape Town               Swartberg  mountains near the town of  Oudtshoorn              A field of flowers in Weskus National Park.       South Africa is one of only 17 countries worldwide considered  megadiverse . It has more than 20,000 different  plants , or about 10% of all the known  species  of plants on  Earth , making it particularly rich in plant biodiversity. South Africa is the 6th most biodiverse country, [ 30 ]  after  Brazil ,  Colombia ,  Indonesia ,  China , and  Mexico . The most prevalent biome in South Africa is the  grassland , particularly on the  Highveld , where the plant cover is dominated by different  grasses , low  shrubs , and  acacia trees , mainly camel-thorn and whitethorn.  Vegetation  becomes even more sparse towards the northwest due to low  rainfall . There are several species of water-storing  succulents  like  aloes  and euphorbias in the very hot and dry  Namaqualand  area. The grass and thorn  savannah  turns slowly into a bush savannah towards the north-east of the country, with denser growth. There are significant numbers of  baobab  trees in this area, near the northern end of  Kruger National Park . [ 31 ]   The  Fynbos   Biome , which makes up the majority of the area and plant life in the  Cape floristic region , one of the six  floral kingdoms , is located in a small region of the  Western Cape  and contains more than 9,000 of those species, making it among the richest regions on earth in terms of floral biodiversity. The majority of the plants are  evergreen  hard-leaf plants with fine, needle-like  leaves , such as the  sclerophyllous  plants. Another uniquely South African plant is the  protea  genus of flowering plants. There are around 130 different species of protea in South Africa.   While South Africa has a great wealth of flowering plants, it has few  forests . Only 1% of South Africa is forest, almost exclusively in the  humid   coastal plain  along the  Indian Ocean  in  KwaZulu-Natal  (see  KwaZulu-Cape coastal forest mosaic ). There are even smaller reserves of forests that are out of the reach of  fire , known as montane forests (see  Knysna-Amatole montane forests ).  Plantations  of imported tree species are predominant, particularly the non-native  eucalyptus  and  pine . South Africa has lost a large area of natural habitat in the last four decades, primarily due to  overpopulation , sprawling development patterns and  deforestation  during the nineteenth century. South Africa is one of the worst affected countries in the world when it comes to invasion by alien species with many (e.g.  Black Wattle ,  Port Jackson ,  Hakea ,  Lantana  and  Jacaranda ) posing a significant threat to the native  biodiversity  and the already scarce water resources. The original  temperate forest  that met the first European settlers to South Africa was exploited ruthlessly until only small patches remained. Currently, South African  hardwood  trees like  Real Yellowwood   (Podocarpus latifolius) ,  stinkwood   (Ocotea bullata) , and South African  Black Ironwood   (Olea laurifolia)  are under government protection.   Numerous  mammals  are found in the  bushveld  habitats including  lions ,  leopards ,  white rhinos ,  blue wildebeest ,  kudus ,  impalas ,  hyenas ,  hippopotamus  and  giraffes . A significant extent of the bushveld habitat exists in the north-east including  Kruger National Park  and the  Mala Mala  Reserve, as well as in the far north in the  Waterberg Biosphere .   Climate change is expected to bring considerable warming and drying to much of this already semi-arid region, with greater frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, flooding and drought. According to computer generated climate modelling produced by the South African National Biodiversity Institute [ 32 ]  parts of southern Africa will see an increase in temperature by about one degree Celsius along the coast to more than four degrees Celsius in the already hot hinterland such as the  Northern Cape  in late spring and summertime by 2050.   The Cape Floral Kingdom has been identified as one of the global  biodiversity hotspots  since it will be hit very hard by  climate change  and has such a great diversity of life. Drought, increased intensity and frequency of fire and climbing temperatures are expected to push many of these  rare species  towards  extinction .   South Africa houses many endemic species, among them the  critically endangered   Riverine Rabbit  ( Bunolagus monticullaris ) in the  Karoo .     Economy       Main article:  Economy of South Africa              The  Victoria & Alfred Waterfront  in  Cape Town  with  Table Mountain  in the background. Cape Town has become an important  retail  and  tourism  centre for the country, and attracts the largest number of foreign visitors in South Africa       By  UN  classification South Africa is a middle-income country with an abundant supply of resources, well-developed financial, legal, communications, energy, and transport sectors, a  stock exchange  (the  JSE Limited ), that ranks among the top twenty in the world, and a modern infrastructure supporting an efficient distribution of goods to major urban centres throughout the entire region. South Africa is ranked 25th in the world in terms of  GDP  (PPP) as of 2007.   Advanced development is significantly localised around four areas: Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Durban, and Pretoria/Johannesburg. Beyond these four economic centres, development is marginal and poverty is still prevalent despite government efforts. Consequently the vast majority of South Africans are poor. However, key marginal areas have experienced rapid growth recently. Such areas include Mossel Bay to Plettenberg Bay; Rustenburg area; Nelspruit area; Bloemfontein; Cape West Coast; and the KwaZulu-Natal North Coast.   Even though South Africa has the seventh highest per capita income in Africa, only behind  Libya ,  Mauritius  it suffers from large income gaps and a  dual economy  marking it as a  developing country . South Africa has one of the highest rates of  income inequality  in the world. A decade of continual economic growth has helped to lower unemployment, but daunting economic and social problems remain. The average South African household income decreased considerably between 1995 and 2000. As for racial inequality,  Statistics South Africa  reported that in 1995 the average white household earned four times as much as the average black household. In 2000 the average white household was earning six times more than the average black household. [ 33 ]  The  affirmative action  policies have seen a rise in black economic wealth and an emerging black middle class. [ 34 ]  Other problems are crime, corruption, and  HIV / AIDS .   At the start of 2000, then President Thabo Mbeki vowed to promote economic growth and foreign investment by relaxing restrictive labour laws, stepping up the pace of  privatisation , and cutting unneeded governmental spending. His policies face strong opposition from organised  labour . South Africa is also the largest energy producer and consumer on the continent. South Africa is a popular tourist destination, and a substantial amount of revenue comes from tourism. [ 35 ]  Among the main attractions are the diverse and picturesque culture, the game reserves and the highly regarded local wines.   The South African  rand  (ZAR), is the most actively traded emerging  market currency  in the world. It has joined an elite club of fifteen currencies, the  Continuous linked settlement  (CLS), where forex transactions are settled immediately, lowering the risks of transacting across  time zones . The rand was the best-performing currency against the  United States dollar  (USD) between 2002 and 2005, according to the  Bloomberg  Currency Scorecard.   The volatility of the  rand  has affected economic activity, falling sharply during 2001 and hitting a historic low of 13.85  ZAR  to the  USD , raising fears of inflation, and causing the Reserve Bank to increase  interest rates . The rand has since recovered, trading at 7.13 ZAR to the dollar as of January 2008. However, as exporters are put under considerable pressure from a stronger domestic currency, many call for government intervention to help soften the rand.   Refugees from poorer neighbouring countries include many immigrants from the DRC, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Malawi and others, representing a large portion of the informal sector. With high unemployment levels amongst poorer South Africans,  xenophobia  is prevalent and many people born in South Africa feel resentful of immigrants who are seen to be depriving the native population of jobs, a feeling which has been given credibility by the fact that many South African employers have employed migrants from other countries for lower pay than South African citizens, especially in the  construction ,  tourism ,  agriculture  and  domestic service  industries. Illegal immigrants are also heavily involved in informal trading. [ 36 ]  However, many immigrants to South Africa continue to live in poor conditions, and the South African immigration policy has become increasingly restrictive since 1994. [ 37 ]   Principal international trading partners of South Africa  besides other African countries  include  Germany ,  Japan ,  Switzerland , the  United Kingdom , and the  United States . Chief exports include  corn ,  diamonds ,  fruits ,  gold ,  metals  and  minerals ,  sugar , and  wool .  Machinery  and transportation equipment make up more than one-third of the value of the countrys imports. Other imports include  chemicals , manufactured goods, and  petroleum .     Electricity crisis   After unsuccessful attempts by the government to encourage private construction of electricity generation capacity, in 2007 the state-owned electricity supplier ( Eskom ) started experiencing a lack of capacity in the electrical generating and reticulation infrastructure. This led to an inability to meet the routine demands of industry and consumers, resulting in countrywide  rolling blackouts . Initially the lack of capacity was triggered by a failure at  Koeberg nuclear power station , but since then a general lack of capacity became evident. The supplier has been widely criticised for failing to adequately plan for and construct sufficient electrical generating capacity, [ 38 ]  although ultimately the government has admitted that it is at fault for refusing to approve funding for investment in infrastructure. [ 39 ]     Agriculture          Workers planting on a farm in the central area of  Mpumalanga .               Farm  workers.       South Africa has a large agricultural sector and is a net exporter of  farming  products. There are almost a thousand  agricultural cooperatives  and  agribusinesses  throughout the country, and agricultural exports have constituted 8% of South African total exports for the past five years. The agricultural industry contributes around 10% of formal employment, relatively low compared to other parts of Africa, as well as providing work for casual labourers and contributing around 2.6% of  GDP  for the nation. [ 40 ]  However, due to the  aridity  of the land, only 13.5% can be used for crop production, and only 3% is considered high potential land. [ 41 ]   Although the commercial farming sector is relatively well developed, people in some rural areas still survive on  subsistence agriculture . It is the eighth largest wine producer in the world, and the eleventh largest producer of sunflower seed. South Africa is a net exporter of agricultural products and foodstuffs, the largest number of exported items being  sugar ,  grapes ,  citrus ,  nectarines ,  wine  and  deciduous  fruit. The largest locally produced crop is  maize  (corn), and it has been estimated that 9 million tons are produced every year, with 7.4 million tons being consumed.  Livestock  are also popular on South African farms, with the country producing 85% of all meat consumed. The dairy industry consists of around 4,300 milk producers providing employment for 60,000 farm workers and contributing to the livelihoods of around 40,000 others. [ 42 ]   In recent years, the agricultural sector has introduced several reforms, some of which are controversial, such as  land reform  and the deregulation of the market for agricultural products. Land reform has been criticised both by farmers' groups and by landless workers, the latter alleging that the pace of change has not been fast enough, and the former alleging racist treatment and expressing concerns that a similar situation to  Zimbabwe's land reform policy  may develop, [ 43 ]  a fear exacerbated by comments made by  deputy president , the deputy president of South Africa. [ 44 ] [ 45 ]  The sector continues to face problems, with increased foreign competition and crime being two of the major challenges for the industry. The government has been accused of either putting in too much effort [ 46 ] , or not enough effort [ 47 ] , to tackle the problem of  farm attacks  as opposed to other forms of violent crime.   Another issue which affects South African agriculture is environmental damage caused by misuse of the land and global climate change. South Africa is unusually vulnerable to climate change and resultant diminution of surface waters. Some predictions show surface water supply could decrease by 60% by the year 2070 in parts of the Western Cape. [ 48 ]  To reverse the damage caused by land mismanagement, the government has supported a scheme which promotes  sustainable development  and the use of natural resources. [ 49 ]  Maize production, which contributes to a 36% majority of the gross value of South Africas field crops, has also experienced negative effects due to climate change. The estimated value of loss, which takes into consideration scenarios with and without the carbon dioxide fertilization effect [2]  ,ranges between 10s to 100s of millions of Rands.

South Africa is a nation of more than 48 million people of diverse origins,  cultures ,  languages , and  religions . The last  census  was held in 2001 and the next will be in 2011.  Statistics South Africa  provided five  racial  categories by which people could classify themselves, the last of which, ""unspecified/other"" drew negligible responses, and these results were omitted. [ 51 ]  The 2006 midyear estimated figures for the other categories were  Black African  at 79.5%,  White  at 9.2%,  Coloured  at 8.9%, and  Indian or Asian  at 2.5%. [ 52 ]  Even though the population of South Africa has increased in the past decade [ 51 ] [ 53 ]  (primarily due to immigration), the country had an annual population growth rate of 0.501% in 2008 (CIA est.), including immigration. [ 54 ]  South Africa is home to an estimated 5 million  illegal immigrants , including some 3 million  Zimbabweans . [ 55 ] [ 56 ] [ 57 ]  A series of  anti-immigrant riots  occurred in South Africa beginning on 11 May 2008. [ 58 ] [ 59 ]   By far the major part of the population classified itself as African or black, but it is not culturally or linguistically homogeneous. Major ethnic groups include the  Zulu ,  Xhosa ,  Basotho  (South Sotho),  Bapedi  (North Sotho),  Venda ,  Tswana ,  Tsonga ,  Swazi  and  Ndebele , all of which speak  Bantu languages  (see  Bantu peoples of South Africa ).   Some, such as the Zulu, Xhosa, Bapedi and Venda groups, are unique to South Africa. Other groups are distributed across the borders with neighbours of South Africa: The  Basotho  group is also the major ethnic group in  Lesotho . The  Tswana  ethnic group constitute the majority of the population of  Botswana . The  Swazi  ethnic group is the major ethnic group in  Swaziland . The  Ndebele  ethnic group is also found in  Matabeleland  in  Zimbabwe , where they are known as the  Matabele . These Ndebele people are the descendants of a Zulu faction under the warrior  Mzilikazi  that escaped persecution from  Shaka  by migrating to their current territory. The  Tsonga  ethnic group is also found in southern  Mozambique , where they are known as the Shangaan.   The white population is not ethnically homogenous and descend from many ethnic groups:  Dutch ,  Flemish ,  Portuguese , German, French  Huguenot , English, Irish, Italian, Scottish and  Welsh . Culturally and linguistically, they are divided into the  Afrikaners , who speak  Afrikaans , and English-speaking groups, many of whom are descended from British and Irish immigrants (see  Anglo-African ). Many small communities that have immigrated over the last century retain the use of other languages. The  white population  is on the decrease due to a low birth rate and emigration; as a factor in their decision to emigrate, many cite the high  crime  rate and the  affirmative action  policies of the government. Since 1994, approximately 1 000 000 white South Africans have permanently emigrated. [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ] [ 63 ]  Despite high emigration levels, a high level of non-South African white immigrants have settled in the country, in particular from countries such as  Britain  and  Zimbabwe . For example, by 2005, an estimated 212 000 British citizens were residing in South Africa. Since 2003, the numbers of British migrants coming to South Africa has risen by 50%. An estimated 20 000 British migrants moved to South Africa in 2007. There have also been a significant number of  white Zimbabwean  arrivals, fleeing their home country in light of the economic and political problems currently facing the country. As well as recent arrivals, a significant number of white Zimbabweans emigrated to South Africa in the wake of independence in Zimbabwe in 1980. Some of the more nostalgic members of the community are known in popular culture as "" Whenwes "", because of their nostalgia for their lives in  Rhodesia  ""when we were in Rhodesia"". [ 64 ]   The term  Coloured  is still largely used for the people of mixed race descended from slaves brought in from East and Central Africa, the indigenous  Khoisan  who lived in the  Cape  at the time, Bantus, Whites (mostly the  Dutch / Afrikaner  and British settlers) as well as an admixture of  Javanese ,  Malay , Indian,  Malagasy  and Asian blood (such as  Burmese ). The majority speak Afrikaans. Khoisan is a term used to describe two separate groups, physically similar: light-skinned and small in stature. The  Khoikhoi , who were called  Hottentots  by the Europeans, were pastoralists and were annihilated; the San, called  Bushmen  by the Europeans, were hunter-gatherers. Within the Coloured community, more recent immigrants will also be found: Coloureds from the former  Rhodesia  (now  Zimbabwe );  Namibia  and immigrants of mixed descent from India and  Burma  ( Anglo-Indians / Anglo-Burmese ) who were welcomed to the Cape when India and Burma received their Independence.   The major part of the South African  Asian  population is Indian in origin (see  Indian South Africans ); many of them descended from indentured workers brought in the nineteenth century to work on the  sugar   plantations  of the eastern coastal area then known as  Natal . There is also a significant group of  Chinese South Africans  (approximately 100,000 individuals) and  Vietnamese  South Africans (approximately 50,000 individuals). In 2008, the Pretoria High Court has ruled that Chinese South Africans who arrived before 1994 are to be reclassified as  Coloureds . As a result of this ruling, about 12,000 - 15,000  [ 65 ] ethnically Chinese citizens who arrived before 1994, numbering 3%-5% of the total Chinese population in the country, will be able to benefit from government  BEE  policies. [ 66 ]   South Africa hosts a sizeable refugee and asylum seeker population. According to the  World Refugee Survey 2008 , published by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, this population numbered approximately 144,700 in 2007. [ 67 ]  Groups of refugees and asylum seekers numbering over 10,000 included people from  Zimbabwe  (48,400), The  Democratic Republic of the Congo  (24,800), and  Somalia  (12,900). [ 67 ]  These populations mainly lived in Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban, Cape Town, and Port Elizabeth. [ 67 ]     Science and technology   Several important scientific and technological developments have originated in South Africa.  The first human to human heart transplant was performed by cardiac surgeon  Christiaan Barnard  at  Groote Schuur Hospital  in December 1967  .  Max Theiler  developed a vaccine against Yellow Fever,  Allan McLeod Cormack  pioneered x-ray  Computed tomography , and  Aaron Klug  developed crystallographic electron microscopy techniques. These advancements were all recognized with  Nobel Prizes .  Sydney Brenner  won most recently, in 2002, for his pioneering work in  molecular biology .   Mark Shuttleworth  founded an early Internet security company  Thawte , that was subsequently bought out by world-leader  VeriSign . Despite government efforts to encourage entrepreneurship in biotechnology, IT and other high technology fields, no other notable groundbreaking companies have been founded in South Africa. However, it is the expressed objective of the government to transition the economy to be more reliant on high technology, based on the realization that South African cannot compete with Far Eastern economies in manufacturing, nor can the republic rely on its mineral wealth in perpetuity.   South Africa has cultivated a burgeoning astronomy community. It hosts the  Southern African Large Telescope , the largest optical telescope in the southern hemisphere. South Africa is currently building the  Karoo Array Telescope  as a pathfinder for the $20 billion  Square Kilometer Array  project. South Africa is a finalist, with Australia, to be the host of the SKA.     Society and culture       Main article:  Culture of South Africa              Decorated houses,  Drakensberg Mountains              Traditional  South African cuisine .       It may be argued that there is no ""single"" culture in South Africa because of its ethnic diversity. Today, the diversity in foods from many cultures is enjoyed by all and especially marketed to tourists who wish to sample the large variety of South African cuisine. In addition to  food ,  music  and  dance  feature prominently.   South African cuisine  is heavily  meat-based  and has spawned the distinctively South African social gathering known as a  braai , or barbecue. South Africa has also developed into a major  wine  producer, with some of the best  vineyards  lying in valleys around  Stellenbosch ,  Franschoek ,  Paarl  and  Barrydale . [ 68 ]   There is great diversity in music from South Africa. Many black musicians who sang in Afrikaans or English during apartheid have since begun to sing in traditional African languages, and have developed a unique style called  Kwaito . Of note is  Brenda Fassie , who launched to fame with her song ""Weekend Special"", which was sung in English. More famous traditional musicians include  Ladysmith Black Mambazo , while the  Soweto String Quartet  performs classic music with an African flavour. White and Coloured South African singers are historically influenced by European musical styles including such western metal bands such as  Seether  (formerly Saron Gas). South Africa has produced world-famous jazz musicians, notably  Hugh Masekela ,  Jonas Gwangwa ,  Abdullah Ibrahim ,  Miriam Makeba ,  Jonathan Butler ,  Chris McGregor , and  Sathima Bea Benjamin .  Afrikaans  music covers multiple genres, such as the  contemporary   Steve Hofmeyr  and the  punk rock  band  Fokofpolisiekar . Crossover artists such as  Johnny Clegg  and his bands  Juluka  and  Savuka  have enjoyed various success underground, publicly, and abroad.   The South African black majority still has a substantial number of rural inhabitants who lead largely impoverished lives. It is among these people, however, that cultural traditions survive most strongly; as blacks have become increasingly  urbanised  and  westernised , aspects of traditional culture have declined. Urban blacks usually speak English or  Afrikaans  in addition to their native tongue. There are smaller but still significant groups of speakers of  Khoisan languages  who are not included in the eleven official languages, but are one of the eight other officially recognised languages. There are small groups of speakers of  endangered languages , most of which are from the Khoi-San family, that receive no official status; however, some groups within South Africa are attempting to promote their use and revival.   The  middle class  lifestyle, predominantly of the white minority but with growing numbers of Black, Coloured and Indian people, [ 69 ]  is similar in many respects to that of people found in  Western Europe , North America and  Australasia . Members of the middle class often study and work abroad for greater exposure to the markets of the world.   Asians , predominantly of Indian origin, preserve their own cultural heritage, languages and religious beliefs, being either  Christian ,  Hindu  or  Sunni Muslim  and speaking English, with Indian languages like  Hindi ,  Telugu ,  Tamil  or  Gujarati  being spoken less frequently, but the majority of Indians being able to understand their mother tongue. The first Indians arrived on the famous  Truro ship  as  indentured labourers  in Natal to work the Sugar Cane Fields. There is a much smaller  Chinese  community in South Africa, although its numbers have increased due to immigration from  Republic of China  (Taiwan).   South Africa has also had a large influence in the  Scouting  movement, with many Scouting traditions and ceremonies coming from the experiences of  Robert Baden-Powell  (the founder of Scouting) during his time in South Africa as a military officer in the 1890s. The  South African Scout Association  was one of the first youth organisations to open its doors to youth and adults of all races in South Africa. This happened on 2 July 1977 at a conference known as  Quo Vadis . [ 70 ]   The South African music scene consists of  Kwaito , a new music genre that had developed in the mid 80s and has since developed to become the most popular social economical form of representation among the populous. Though some may argue that the political aspects of Kwaito has since diminished after  Apartheid , and the relative interest in politics has become a minor aspect of daily life. Some argue that in a sense,  Kwaito  is in fact a political force that shows activism in its apolitical actions. Today, major corporations like  Sony ,  BMG , and  EMI  have appeared on the South African scene to produce and distribute  Kwaito  music. Due to its overwhelming popularity, as well as the general influence of DJs, who are among the top 5 most influential types of people within the country,  Kwaito  has taken over radio, television, and magazines. [ 71 ]   Kwaito , much like most hip-hop has its own local flavor and originality. However, unlike when hip-hop first burst on the scene as a politically driven and rebellious underground movement, South Africans wanted to create a happier vibe. As the post-apartheid fog cleared, South African youth found their ""own voice in a style of music known as kwaito, spawning a new (and profitable) industry"". [ 72 ]  According to TIMEeurope magazine, ""The kwaito sound now regularly incorporates traditional African music, jazz, gospel, and even rock guitar, most notably on Mandoza's 2000 hit Nkalakatha, one of the few kwaito records to cross over onto traditionally white radio"". [ 73 ]  In the kwaito, the samples from old school  Jamaican dancehall , European house, etc.,  tempos  are changed, beats are added, and urban street slang is also incorporated. This local flavor of music more recently has been attacked for its lack of ingenuity and its betrayal of its roots. The melodies and the incorporation of sex and dance have since become very similar to the American standard. In addition Kwaito has been criticised for its absence of influential lyrical content. As Kwaito is still a developing genre, and since the South African population is only around 48 million, sales of only 25,000 CDs are required for ""gold"" certification in South Africa. [ 72 ]     Religion       Main article:  Religion in South Africa               St. Mark 's Anglican Cathedral.       According to the latest 2001 national census, Christians accounted for 79.7% of the population. This includes  Zion Christian  11.1%,  Pentecostal  ( Charismatic ) 8.2%,  Roman Catholic  7.1%,  Methodist  6.8%,  Dutch Reformed  6.7%,  Anglican  3.8%, and other Christian 36%.  Islam  accounted for 1.5% of the population,  Hinduism  about 1.3%, and  Judaism  0.2%. 15.1% had no religious affiliation, 2.3% were other and 1.4% were unspecified. [ 74 ] [ 75 ]   African Indigenous Churches were the largest of the  Christian  groups. It was believed that many of these persons who claimed no affiliation with any organised religion adhered to  traditional indigenous religions . Many peoples have  syncretic  religious practices combining Christian and indigenous influences. [ 76 ]   Islam in South Africa  itself is not known to pre-date the colonial period, despite the isolated contact neighbouring  Mozambique  had with  Arab  and  East African  traders. [ citation needed ]  There is no evidence that Islam was known to the  Zulu ,  Swazi , or  Xhosa  of the east coast prior to the colonial era. Many South African Muslims are described as  Coloureds , notably in the  Western Cape , especially those whose ancestors came as slaves from the Indonesian archipelago (the  Cape Malays ). Others are described as  Indians , notably in  KwaZulu-Natal , including those whose ancestors came as traders from  South Asia ; they have been joined by others from other parts of Africa as well as white or black South African converts. It is estimated that  Islam  is the fastest growing religion of conversion in the country, [ 77 ]  with the number of black  Muslims  growing sixfold, from 12,000 in 1991 to 74,700 in 2004. [ 78 ]   Hinduism  dates back to British Colonial period primarily but later waves of continuous immigrants from India have contributed to a sizable Hindu population. Most Hindus are ethnically South Asian but there are many who come from mixed racial stock and many are converts with the efforts of Hindu missionaries such as ISKCON. Other religions in smaller numbers are  Sikhism ,  Jainism  and  Bah' Faith . [ 75 ]     Languages       Main article:  Languages of South Africa              Map showing principal South African languages by municipality. Lighter shades indicate a non-majority  plurality .             Afrikaans          Northern Sotho          Southern Sotho          Swati          Tsonga            Tswana          Venda          Xhosa          Zulu               South Africa has eleven  official languages : [ 79 ]   Sepedi ,  Sesotho ,  Setswana ,  siSwati ,  Tshivenda ,  Xitsonga ,  Afrikaans ,  English ,  isiNdebele ,  isiXhosa  and  isiZulu . In this regard it is  second only to India  in number. While each language is formally equal to every other, some languages are spoken more than others. According to the 2001 National Census, the three most spoken first home languages are Zulu (23.8%), Xhosa (17.6%) and Afrikaans (13.3%). [ 51 ]  Despite the fact that English is recognised as the language of commerce and science, it was spoken by only 8.2% of South Africans at home in 2001, an even lower percentage than in 1996 (8.6%). [ 51 ]   There are  eleven official names  for South Africa, one in each of the official national languages. The country also recognises eight non-official languages:  Fanagalo ,  Khoe ,  Lobedu ,  Nama ,  Northern Ndebele ,  Phuthi ,  San  and  South African Sign Language . [ citation needed ]  These non-official languages may be used in certain official uses in limited areas where it has been determined that these languages are prevalent. Nevertheless, their populations are not such that they require nationwide recognition.   Many of the ""unofficial languages"" of the  San  and  Khoikhoi  people contain regional  dialects  stretching northward into Namibia and Botswana, and elsewhere. These people, who are a physically distinct population from other Africans, have their own cultural identity based on their  hunter-gatherer  societies. They have been marginalised to a great extent, and many of their languages are in danger of becoming  extinct .   Many white South Africans also speak other European languages, such as  Portuguese  (also spoken by Angolan and Mozambican blacks), German, and  Greek , while some  Asians  and  Indians  in South Africa speak  South Asian  languages, such as  Tamil ,  Hindi ,  Gujarati ,  Urdu  and  Telugu .  French  is still widely spoken by French South Africans especially in places like  Franschhoek , where many South Africans are of French origin. South African French is spoken by less than 10,000 individuals. Congolese French is also spoken in South Africa by migrants.

South Africa was only allowed to participate from 1995 since the end of  Apartheid . It followed the 1995 Rugby World Cup by hosting and winning the  1996 African Cup of Nations  football tournament. It also hosted the  2003 Cricket World Cup  and the  2007 World Twenty20 Championship . South Africa will be the host nation for the  2010 FIFA World Cup , which will be the first time the tournament is held on the African continent.   In 2004, the swim team of  Roland Schoeman ,  Lyndon Ferns ,  Darian Townsend  and  Ryk Neethling  won the gold medal at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, simultaneously breaking the world record in the 4x100 freestyle relay.  Penny Heyns  won Olympic Gold in the 1996  Atlanta Olympic Games .   In golf,  Gary Player  is generally regarded as one of the greatest golfers of all time, having won the  Career Grand Slam , one of five golfers to have done so. Other South African golfers to have successfully won a major tournament include  Bobby Locke ,  Ernie Els ,  Retief Goosen  and  Trevor Immelman .     Current issues     HIV/AIDS       Main article:  HIV/AIDS in South Africa       The spread of  AIDS  (acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome) is an alarming problem in South Africa with up to 31% of pregnant women found to be HIV infected in 2005 and the infection rate among adults estimated at 20%. [ 80 ]  The link between HIV, a virus spread primarily by sexual contact, and AIDS was long denied by prior president  Thabo Mbeki  and then health minister  Manto Tshabalala-Msimang , who insisted that the many deaths in the country are due to malnutrition, and hence poverty, and not HIV. [ 81 ]  In 2007, in response to international pressure, the government made efforts to fight AIDS. [ 82 ]  In September 2008 Thabo Mbeki was ousted by the ANC and  Kgalema Motlanthe  was appointed for the interim. One of Mr. Motlanthe's first actions was to replace Mrs. Tshabalala-Msimang with the current minister,  Barbara Hogan .   AIDS affects mainly those who are sexually active and is far more prevalent in the black population. Most deaths are people who are also economically active, resulting in many families losing their primary wage earners. This has resulted in many 'AIDS orphans' who in many cases depend on the state for care and financial support. [ 83 ]  It is estimated that there are 1,200,000 orphans in South Africa. [ 83 ]  Many elderly people also lose the support from lost younger members of their family. Roughly 5 million people are infected with the disease. [ 82 ]     Crime       Main article:  Crime in South Africa               Prison  buildings on  Robben Island       According to a survey for the period 19982000 compiled by the  United Nations , South Africa was ranked second for  murder  and first for  assaults  and  rapes  per capita. [ 84 ]  Total crime per capita is 10th out of the 60 countries in the data set.   Crime  has had a pronounced effect on society: many middle-class South Africans moved into  gated communities , abandoning the central business districts of some cities for the relative security of suburbs. This effect is most pronounced in  Johannesburg , although the trend is noticeable in other cities as well. [ citation needed ]  Many emigrants from South Africa also state that crime was a big motivator for them to leave.  Crime against the farming community  has continued to be a major problem. [ 85 ]     Skills migration   Along with many African nations, South Africa has been experiencing a "" brain drain "" in the past 20 years. This is believed to be potentially damaging for the regional economy, [ 86 ]  and is almost certainly detrimental for the well-being of the majority of people reliant on the healthcare infrastructure, given the HIV/AIDS epidemic. [ 87 ]  The skills drain in South Africa tends to demonstrate racial contours (naturally given the skills distribution legacy of South Africa) and has thus resulted in large white South African communities abroad. [ 88 ]     Xenophobia       Main article:  Xenophobia in South Africa       In May 2008 long standing state hostility to African migrants exploded in a series of pogroms that left up to 100 people dead and 100,000 displaced.

Barbados went into a deep  recession  in the 1990s after 3 years of steady decline brought on by fundamental macroeconomic imbalances. After a painful readjustment process, the economy began to grow again in 1993. Growth rates have averaged between 3%-5% since then.   The people of Barbados are referred to as Barbadians or  Bajans .     [ edit ]   History     [ edit ]   Pre-independence   Since the first settlement by the  British  in 1625, through history the  economy of Barbados  was primarily dependent on  agriculture . It had been recorded that minus the marshes and gully regions, during the 1630s much of the desirable land had been deforested across the entire island. Quickly Barbados was then divided into large estate-plantations and using indentured labour mainly from the British Isles for the cultivation of both the crops  Tobacco  and  Cotton  were first introduced. The island, facing a large amount of competition from the North American Colonies and the other Caribbean islands switched to the crop of  sugar cane . Cultivation of sugar cane was quickly introduced by the exiled  Jewish  community which immigrated into Barbados from  Brazil  during the mid-1600s. This became the single best move ever for the Barbados economy at the time, the economy boomed and Barbados had become populated with so many windmills that the island had the second highest density of windmills per square mile in the world, second only to the  Netherlands   [1] . For about the next 100 years Barbados remained the richest of all the European colonies in the Caribbean region. The prosperity in the colony of Barbados remained regionally unmatched until sugar cane production grew larger in geographically larger countries such as  Haiti ,  Jamaica  and elsewhere. Despite being eclipsed by larger makers of sugar, Barbados continued to produce the crop well into the 1900s and to this day.   With the emancipation of the African slaves in the British Empire in 1834, thereafter many Bajans started to place more emphasis on upward mobility and strong education to combat plantation living.   During the 1930s, politicians in Barbados started pushing for more self-government along with Barbados seeking to retain more of the profits from the economic growth within the country. At the time much of the profits were being repatriated by the British government to the United Kingdom. As the 1940s-1950s rolled around, Barbados moved towards developing political ties with neighboring Caribbean islands. By 1958 the  West Indies Federation  was created by Britain for Barbados and nine other Caribbean territories. The Federation was first led by the premier for the colony of Barbados, however the experiment ended by 1962. Later Barbados tried to negotiate several other unions with other islands, yet it became likely that Barbados needed to move on. The island peacefully negotiated with Britiain its own independence and became a sovereign nation at midnight on  November 30 ,  1966 .     [ edit ]   Post independence   Following independence from the  United Kingdom  on  November 30 ,  1966  sugar cane still remained a chief money-maker for Barbados. The island's politicians tried to diversify the economy from just agriculture. During the 1950s-1960s visitors from both  Canada  and the  United Kingdom  started transforming tourism into a huge contributor for the Barbadian economy. The man-made  Deep Water Harbour  port at  Bridgetown  had been completed in 1961, and there-after the island could handle most modern ocean going ships for shipping sugar or handling cargoes at the port facility.   As 1970s rolled around, global companies started to recognize Barbados for its highly educated population. In May 1972 Barbados formed its own  Central Bank , breaking off from the  East Caribbean Currency Authority  (ECCA). By 1975 the Barbadian dollar was changed to a new fixed / constant rate of exchange rate with the US$ with the rate being changed to present day US$1 = BDS$2.00 (BDS$1.00 = US$0.50).   By the 1980s a growing manufacturing industry was seen as a considerable earner for the Barbados economy. With manufacturing then being led by companies such as Intel Corporation and others, the Manufacturing industry contributed greatly to the economy during the 1980s and early 1990s.   As one of the founding members, Barbados joined the World Trade Organization on  1 January   1995 . Following the membership in the WTO, the Government of Barbados aggressively tried to make the Barbados economy fully WTO compliant. This led to collapse of much of the manufacturing industry of Barbados during the late 1990s in favour of many companies like Intel and others moving to lower cost Asian economies. During the late 1990s more companies started to become interested in Barbados' offshore sector, until it over took sugar as the new chief money maker. In 1999-2000 the  OECD  ""blacklist"" was circulated with Barbados listed in error. The negative fallout stymied new investment into Barbados' offshore sector Barbados for near 2 years as Barbados authorities acted swiftly successfully proving that Barbados' economy was regulated sufficiently to ward off financial criminal activity and that it was not a ""Tax Haven"" as charged, but instead a low-tax regime.   As the global recession hit in 2001, the offshore sector in Barbados slightly contracted further thereby making Tourism as the new chief money maker, after having earlier eclipsed Manufacturing and Sugar Cane. The Government of Barbados further changed legislation to transform the Barbados economy into one which fosters investment. Leading to several new Hotel developments. The government continues to try maintaining constraint from personal involvement in the Hotel activity and instead seeks private investment into the Barbados economy for future growth.   Several large hotel projects like the  Port Charles Marina  project in  Speightstown  helped the tourism industry continue to expand in 1996-99, and more recently the new Hilton Hotel on Needhams Point, Saint Michael in 2005.

The government continues its efforts to reduce the unacceptably high unemployment rate which it met in the 1990s, encourage direct foreign investment, and privatize remaining  state-owned enterprises .   The main factors responsible for the improvement in economic activity include an expansion in the number of tourist arrivals, an increase in manufacturing, and an increase in sugar production. Recently, offshore  banking  and financial services also have become an important source of  foreign exchange  and  economic growth .   Economic growth has led to net increases in employment in the tourism sector, as well as in construction and other services sub-sectors of the economy. The public service remains Barbados' largest single employer. Total labor force has increased from 126,000 in 1993 to 140,000 persons in 2000, and unemployment has dropped significantly from over 20% in the early 1990s to 9.3% at the end of 2000.   The Barbados government encourages the development in: financial services, informatics, e-commerce, tourism, educational and health services, and cultural services for the future. In 2000 based on Barbados' level of growth - (at the time) Barbados was supposed to become the world's smallest developed country by 2008. The Government has since stated that the country is still on course for this to happen instead by around 2025.     [ edit ]   Taxation     [ edit ]   General   In 1997 Barbados implemented a general taxation which covers most items. Known as the  Value-Added Tax  (""VAT"") it covers almost all items at a 15% tax rate and a 7.5% for hotel accommodations. Exported goods and services, prescription drugs and a few other specific items are zero rated under the legislation. The VAT replaced several other taxes such as: the Consumption Tax, Stamp Duty, Surcharge, Excise Tax and an Environmental Levy.   The island continues to wean off of taxes outside of the VAT system. In 2002 the Barbados government increased the level of people in Barbados who are exempt from having to pay taxes on their homes. This has steadily grown with the island heading for a possible rate of 0% taxation in all other areas.   The government has also toyed with the idea of making retirement savings as tax exempt, to encourage Barbadians to spend less on goods and to encourage Barbadians to save more income as they once used to.     [ edit ]   Bilateral treaties   Barbados has several bilateral tax treaties, mostly aimed at removing double taxation on companies that operate in the Barbados economy. Since Barbados is at times considered an expensive place to conduct business, the treaties are mainly a measure to provide some savings to international businesses operating in Barbados. Some of the countries which Barbados has taxation agreements with are:     Botswana ,   Canada ,   China ,   CARICOM ,   Cuba ,   Finland ,   Malta ,   Mauritius ,   Mexico ,   Norway ,   Sweden ,   Switzerland ,   the  United Kingdom ,   the  United States  and   Venezuela .     Source:   Barbados Government website containing the text of the majority of the above tax treaties   The bilateral tax treaty negotiated with Canada in particular has been a political-football for the government of that country. The treaty was made to allow the profits for IBCs and offshore banking companies to be repatriated to Canada tax-free after paying taxes in Barbados. The aim was mainly for companies like the  Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce  (CIBC),  Royal Bank of Canada  (RBC), and  Scotiabank , which (along with Barclays of the United Kingdom), when-combined control a healthy majority of Barbados' local Commercial Banking sector. In essence the treaty makes the economy of Barbados almost an unofficial part of the Canadian economy and it was aimed at allowing Canadian companies to extract profits back to Canada more easily. During the Canadian national elections of 2003 and 2006, it was cited that the former Minister of Finance and later Prime Minister  Paul Martin  had international shipping companies that operated in Barbados' offshore sector under the bilateral treaty possibly saving his company from higher taxes in Canada.     [ edit ]   Primary industries     [ edit ]   Agriculture   About 16,000 hectares (39,500 acres), or 37.2% of the total land area, are classified as arable. At one time, nearly all arable land was devoted to sugarcane, but the percentage devoted to ground crops for local consumption has been increasing. In 1999, 500,000 tons of sugarcane were produced, down from the annual average of 584,000 tons in 198991. In 2001, sugar exports amounted to US$22 million, or 8.4% of total exports. Major food crops are yams, sweet potatoes, corn, eddoes, cassava, and several varieties of beans. Inadequate rainfall and lack of irrigation has prevented the development of other agricultural activity, although some vegetable farming takes place on a commercial scale. Some cotton is also grown in drier parts of the island, but until cotton can be picked by machine it is unlikely that output will rise to its former level.     [ edit ]   Animal husbandry   Livestock rearing isn't a major occupation in Barbados, chiefly because good pasture has always been scarce a& imported animal feed is expensive.The island must import large quantities of meat and dairy products. Most livestock is owned by individual households. Estimates for 1999 showed 23,000 head of cattle, 41,000 sheep, 33,000 hogs, 5,000 goats, and 4,000,000 chickens. Poultry production in 1999 included 9,000 tons of meat and 1,000 tons of hen eggs. Apart from self-sufficiency in milk and poultry, the limited agricultural sector means that Barbados imports large amounts of basic foods, including wheat and meat.     [ edit ]   Fishing   The fishing industry employs about 2,000 persons, and the fleet consists of more than 500 powered boats. The catch in 2000 was 3,100 metric tons. Flying fish, dolphinfish, tuna, turbot, kingfish, and swordfish are among the main species caught. A fisheries terminal complex opened at Oistins in 1983.     [ edit ]   Forestry   Fewer than 20 hectares (50 acres) of original forests have survived the 300 years of sugar cultivation. There are an estimated 5,000 ha (12,350 acres) of forested land, covering about 12% of the total land area. Roundwood production in 2000 totaled 5,000 cu m (176,500 cu ft), and imports amounted to 3,000 cu m (106,000 cu ft). In 2000, Barbados imported $35.3 million in wood and forest products.     [ edit ]   Mining   Deposits of limestone and coral were quarried to meet local construction needs. Production of limestone in 2000 amounted to 1.5 million tons. Clays and shale, sand and gravel, and carbonaceous deposits provided limited yields. Hydraulic cement production totaled 267,659 tons in 2000, up from 106,515 in 1996.     [ edit ]   Secondary industries     [ edit ]   Manufacturing   The manufacturing sector in Barbados has yet to recover from the recession of the late 1980s when bankruptcies occurred and almost one-third of the workforce lost their jobs. Today, approximately 10,000 Barbadians work in manufacturing. The electronics sector in particular was badly hit when the U.S. semi-conductor company, Intel, closed its factory in 1986. Leaving aside traditional manufacturing, such as sugar refining and rum distilling, Barbados's industrial activity is partly aimed at the local market which produces goods such as tinned food, drinks, and cigarettes. Many industrial estates are located throughout the island. A cement factory is located in St.Lucy.   The export markets have been severely damaged by competition from cheaper Caribbean and Latin American competitors. But domestic manufacturing also faces serious potential problems, as trade liberalization means that the government can no longer protect national industries by imposing high tariffs on imported goods. Thus, Barbadian manufacturers must compete with those from other regional economies, whose wage costs and other overheads are usually much lower. The other significant industrial employer is the petroleum sector, where oil deposits are located in the southern parishes but oil has not been produced in commercial quantities; although the island's small oil refinery was closed in 1998 and refining moved to Trinidad and Tobago, where labor and other costs are cheaper.     [ edit ]   Construction   A construction boom, linked to tourism and residential development, has assisted the recovery of a large cement plant in the north of the island that was closed for some years and reopened in 1997.     [ edit ]   Tertiary industries     [ edit ]   Tourism   Tourism is Barbados's crucial economic activity and has been since the 1960s. At least 10 percent of the working population (some 13,000 people) are employed in this sector, which offers a range of tourist accommodations from luxury hotels to modest self-catering establishments. After the recession years, tourism picked up again in the mid-1990s, only to face another slowdown in 1999. This drop was in part due to increasing competition from other Caribbean countries such as the Dominican Republic, and in part to a reduction in visits from cruise ships as they shifted to non-Caribbean routes or shorter routes such as the Bahamas. Cruise ship visitors totaled 445,821 in 1999, a reduction from 517,888 in 1997, but stay-over visitors rose to 517,869 in 1999, setting a new record. Overall, the country witnessed over US$700 million in tourism receipts in 1999.   The real problem for Barbados is that tourist facilities are too densely concentrated on the south coast, which is highly urbanized, while the Atlantic coast, with its rugged shoreline and large waves, is not suitable for beach tourism. There are few large brand-name hotels (the Barbados Hilton was closed for refurbishment in 2000) which makes marketing the island in the United States difficult. On the other hand, the absence of conglomerates and package tours results in a far greater trickle-down of tourist spending among the general population.   Informatics employed almost 1,700 workers in 1999, about the same number as the sugar industry. The island has been involved in data processing since the 1980s and now specializes in operations such as database management and insurance claims processing. Costs in Barbados are higher than elsewhere in the Caribbean (although still only half of costs in the United States), but the island offers strong advantages such as a literate English-speaking workforce and location in the same time zone as the eastern United States. Despite these factors, employment has fallen in recent years, reflecting increasing mobility on the part of foreign companies, which frequently relocate to lower-cost areas.     [ edit ]   Financial services   The financial services sector has also faced problems as licenses issued to new financial companies have slowed down since 1998. There are an estimated 47 offshore banks, as well as hundreds of other insurance and investment companies, all catering to overseas clients. Figures are hard to track, but it is estimated that these financial activities earned BDS$150 million in foreign earnings in 1995. In 1998, approximately 7,500 people were employed in the banking and insurance sector. The financial sector is also under threat of sanctions from the EU and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), both of which have expressed concerns about money laundering, tax evasion, and other financial improprieties in Caribbean offshore centers.     [ edit ]   Retail   Retailing is an important economic activity, especially in Bridgetown where there are large department stores and supermarkets. In the countryside, most stores are small and family-run. Some 18,000 people work in the retail sector.     [ edit ]   Facts & figures     GDP (purchasing power parity)   $5.53 billion (2007 est.)

The South African coast stretches 2,798 kilometres (1,739 mi) [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  and borders both the  Atlantic  and  Indian   oceans . [ 7 ]  To the north of South Africa lie  Namibia ,  Botswana ,  Zimbabwe ,  Mozambique  and  Swaziland , while the  Kingdom of Lesotho  is an independent  enclave  surrounded by South African territory. [ 8 ]   Modern human beings have inhabited South Africa for more than 100,000 years. [ 9 ]  A century and a half after the discovery of the  Cape Sea Route , the  Dutch East India Company   founded  a refreshment station at what would become  Cape Town  in 1652. [ 10 ]  Cape Town became a British colony in 1806. European settlement expanded during the 1820s as the  Boers  (original  Dutch ,  Flemish ,  German  and  French  settlers) and the British  1820 Settlers  claimed land in the north and east of the country. Conflicts arose among the Xhosa, Zulu and Afrikaner groups. However, the discovery of diamonds and later gold triggered the conflict known as the  Anglo-Boer War  as the Boers and the British fought for the control of the South African mineral wealth. Although the Boers were defeated, limited independence was given to South Africa in 1910 as a British dominion. Anti-British policies focused on ultimate independence which was achieved in 1961 when South Africa was declared a  republic . The leading  National Party  legislated for a continuation of racial segregation begun under Dutch and British colonial rule, Boer republics, and subsequent South African governments (and which in 1948 became legally institutionalized  segregation  known as  apartheid ), despite opposition both in and outside of the country. In 1990 the then president  F.W. de Klerk  began to dismantle this legislation, and in 1994 the first democratic election was held in South Africa. This election brought  Nelson Mandela  and the current ruling party, the  African National Congress  to power, and the country rejoined the  Commonwealth of Nations .   South Africa is known for its diversity in cultures, languages, and religious beliefs, and eleven official languages are recognised in its  constitution . [ 7 ]  English is the most commonly spoken language in official and commercial public life, however it is only the fifth most spoken home language. [ 7 ]  South Africa is ethnically diverse, with the largest  Caucasian ,  Indian , and  racially mixed  communities in Africa. Although 79.6% of the South African population is  Black , [ 2 ]  this category is neither culturally nor linguistically homogenous, as people within this classification speak a number of different  Bantu languages , nine of which have official status. [ 7 ]  Midyear 2007, the South African population was estimated at 47.9 million.

(September 2008)           Main article:  History of South Africa       South Africa contains some of the oldest archaeological sites in the world. [ 11 ]   [ 12 ]  Extensive fossil remains at the  Sterkfontein ,  Kromdraai  and Makapansgat caves suggest that various  australopithecines  existed in South Africa from about three million years ago. [ 13 ]  These were succeeded by various species of  Homo , including  Homo habilis ,  Homo erectus  and modern humans,  Homo sapiens . Settlements of  Bantu -speaking peoples, who were  iron -using agriculturists and herdsmen, were already present south of the  Limpopo River  by the fourth or fifth century (see  Bantu expansion ) displacing and absorbing the original  KhoiSan  speakers. They slowly moved south and the earliest ironworks in modern-day  KwaZulu-Natal Province  are believed to date from around 1050. The southernmost group was the  Xhosa  people, whose language incorporates certain linguistic traits from the earlier KhoiSan people, reaching the  Fish River , in today's  Eastern Cape Province . These  Iron Age  populations displaced earlier people, who often had  hunter-gatherer  societies, as they migrated.     European colonisation          Painting of an account of the arrival of  Jan van Riebeeck , the first  European  to settle in South Africa, with  Devil's Peak  in the background       In 1487, the  Portuguese  explorer  Bartolomeu Dias  became the first European to reach the southernmost point of Africa. Initially named The Cape of Storms, The King of Portugal,  John II , renamed it the  Cabo da Boa Esperana  or  Cape of Good Hope  as it led to the riches of India. This great feat of navigation was later immortalized in  Cames ' epic Portuguese poem,  The Lusiads  (1572). In 1652, a refreshment station was established at the  Cape of Good Hope  by  Jan van Riebeeck  on behalf of the  Dutch East India Company .  Slaves  were brought from  Indonesia ,  Madagascar , and India as a labour source for the Dutch immigrants in  Cape Town . As they expanded east, the Dutch settlers eventually met the south-westerly expanding  Xhosa  people in the region of the  Fish River . A series of wars, called the  Cape Frontier Wars , ensued, mainly caused by conflicting land and livestock interests.   Great Britain  took over the  Cape of Good Hope  area in 1795 ostensibly to stop it falling into the hands of the Revolutionary French, but also seeking to use  Cape Town  in particular as a stop on the route to Australia and India. It was later returned to the Dutch in 1803, but soon afterwards the  Dutch East India Company  declared bankruptcy, and the British annexed the Cape Colony in 1806. The British continued the frontier wars against the Xhosa, pushing the eastern frontier eastward through a line of forts established along the Fish River and consolidating it by encouraging  British settlement . Due to pressure of  abolitionist  societies in Britain, the  British parliament  first stopped its global  slave trade  with the passage of the  Slave Trade Act 1807 , then abolished slavery in all its colonies with the  Slavery Abolition Act 1833 . During the 1830s, approximately 12 000  Boers  (later known as  Voortrekkers ), departed from the  Cape Colony , where they were subjected to British control, to the future Natal, Orange Free State and Transvaal regions. The Boers founded the  Boer Republics  - the  South African Republic  (Now  Gauteng ,  Limpopo ,  Mpumalanga  and  North West  provinces) and the  Orange Free State  ( Free State ).   The discovery of  diamonds  in 1867 and  gold  in 1884 in the interior encouraged economic growth and immigration, intensifying the subjugation of the indigenous people. These important economic resources did not only play a role between European and the indigenous population but also between the Boers and the British. [ 14 ]   The  Boer Republics  successfully resisted British encroachments during the  First Boer War  (18801881) using  guerrilla warfare  tactics, much better suited to local conditions. However, the British returned in greater numbers, more experience, and more suitable tactics in the  Second Boer War  (18991902). The Boers' attempt to ally themselves with  German South-West Africa  provided the British with yet another excuse to take control of the Boer Republics. [ citation needed ]           Boers  in combat (1881).         Independence   After four years of negotiating, the  Union of South Africa  was created from the  Cape  and  Natal  colonies, as well as the republics of  Orange Free State  and  Transvaal , on 31 May 1910, exactly eight years after the end of the Second Boer War. The newly created Union of South Africa was a  dominion . The  Natives' Land Act  of 1913 severely restricted the ownership of land by 'blacks', at that stage to a mere 7% of the country, although this amount was eventually increased marginally. [ 15 ]  The union was effectively granted independence from the United Kingdom with the passage of the  Statute of Westminster , which morphed the  British king's  position within South Africa into that of the distinct  King of South Africa . In 1934, the  South African Party  and  National Party  merged to form the  United Party , seeking reconciliation between Afrikaners and English-speaking ""Whites"", but split in 1939 over the entry of the Union into  World War II  as an ally of the United Kingdom, a move which the National Party strongly opposed.   In 1948, the  National Party  was elected to power, and intensified the implementation of racial segregation that had begun under Dutch and British colonial rule, and subsequent South African governments since the Union was formed. The Nationalist Government systematised existing segregationist laws, and the system of segregation became known collectively as  apartheid . Not surprisingly, this segregation also applied to the wealth acquired during rapid industrialisation of the 1950s, '60s, and '70s. While the White minority enjoyed the highest  standard of living  in all of Africa, often comparable to  First World  western nations, the Black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard, including income, education, housing, and life expectancy. On 31 May 1961, following a whites-only  referendum , the country became a  republic  and left the (British)  Commonwealth . The office of  Governor-General  was abolished and replaced with the position of  State President .   Apartheid became increasingly controversial, leading to widespread  sanctions ,  divestment  and growing unrest and oppression within South Africa. (See also the article on the  History of South Africa in the apartheid era .) A long period of harsh suppression by the government, and at times violent resistance,  strikes , marches, protests, and  sabotage  by bombing and other means, by various anti-apartheid movements, most notably the  African National Congress  (ANC), followed. In the late 1970s, South Africa began a programme of  nuclear weapons  development and in the following decade it produced six deliverable nuclear weapons. The rationale for the nuclear arsenal is disputed, but it is believed [ who? ]  that  Vorster  and  P.W. Botha  wanted to be able to catalyse American intervention in the event of a war between South Africa and the  Cuban -supported  MPLA  government of  Angola .     Democracy   In 1990 the  National Party  government took the first step towards negotiating itself out of power when it lifted the ban on the  African National Congress  and other  left-wing  political organisations, and released  Nelson Mandela  from prison after twenty-seven years' incarceration on a  sabotage  sentence. Apartheid legislation was gradually removed from the statute books, and South Africa also destroyed its nuclear arsenal and acceded to the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . The first  multi-racial elections  were held in 1994, which the ANC won by an overwhelming majority. It has been in power ever since.   In  post-apartheid South Africa , millions of South Africans, mostly black, continued to live in  poverty , though poverty among whites, previously rare, has increased greatly. [ 16 ]  While some have partly attributed this to the legacy of the apartheid system, increasingly many attribute it to the failure of the current government to tackle social issues, coupled with the monetary and fiscal discipline of the current government to ensure both redistribution of wealth and economic growth. Since the ANC-led government took power, the  United Nations   Human Development Index  of South Africa has fallen, while it was steadily rising until the mid-1990s. [ 17 ]  Some of this could possibly be attributed to the  AIDS   pandemic  and the failure of the government to take steps to address it, [ 18 ] some of it can also be pinpointed to a government policy of  redistribution of wealth . As a mitigating factor, the social housing policy of the current government has produced an improvement in living conditions.     Politics       Main articles:  Politics of South Africa ,  Government of South Africa , and  Law of South Africa              The  Union Buildings  in  Pretoria  is the home of the South African executive.       South Africa has three capital cities:  Cape Town , the largest of the three, is the  legislative  capital;  Pretoria  is the  administrative  capital; and  Bloemfontein  is the  judicial  capital. South Africa has a  bicameral   parliament : the  National Council of Provinces  (the  upper house ) has 90 members, while the  National Assembly  (the  lower house ) has 400 members. Members of the lower house are elected on a population basis by  proportional representation : half of the members are elected from national lists and the other half are elected from provincial lists. Ten members are elected to represent each province in the National Council of Provinces, regardless of the population of the province. Elections for both chambers are held every five years. The government is formed in the lower house, and the leader of the majority party in the National Assembly is the  President .   The primary sources of South Africa law are Roman-Dutch mercantile law and personal law with English Common law, as imports of Dutch settlements and  British colonialism . [ 19 ]  The first European based law in South Africa was brought by the  Dutch East India Company  and is called  Roman-Dutch law . It was imported before the  codification  of European law into the  Napoleonic Code  and is comparable in many ways to  Scots law . This was followed in the 19th century by  English law , both  common  and  statutory . Starting in 1910 with unification, South Africa had its own  parliament  which passed laws specific for South Africa, building on those previously passed for the individual member colonies.   Current South African politics are dominated by the  African National Congress  (ANC), which received 69.7% of the vote during the last  2004 general election  and 66.3% of the vote in the  2006 municipal election . The current  President of South Africa  is  Kgalema Motlanthe , who replaced  Thabo Mbeki  on 25 September 2008. Mbeki succeeded former President  Nelson Mandela  in 1999, and was re-elected for a second five year term in 2004, but announced his resignation on 20 September 2008.   The main challenger to the rule of the ANC is the  Democratic Alliance  party, which received 12.4% of the vote in the 2004 election and 14.8% in the 2006 election.  Helen Zille , (elected 6 May 2007), is the party leader; the previous leader was  Tony Leon . The formerly dominant  New National Party , which introduced apartheid through its predecessor, the  National Party , chose to merge with the ANC on 9 April 2005. Other major political parties represented in Parliament are the  Inkatha Freedom Party , which mainly represents  Zulu  voters, and the  Independent Democrats , who took 6.97% and 1.7% of the vote respectively, in the 2004 election.   Since 2004, the country has had many thousands of popular protests, some violent, making it, according to one academic, the ""most protest-rich country in the world"". [ 20 ]  Many of these protests have been organised from the growing  shanty towns  that surround South African cities.     Foreign relations and military       Main articles:  South African National Defence Force ,  Foreign relations of South Africa , and  South Africa and weapons of mass destruction       Since the end of apartheid, the South African foreign policy has focused on its African partners particularly in the  Southern African Development Community  (SADC) and the  African Union . South Africa has played a key role as a mediator in African conflicts over the last decade, such as in  Burundi , the  Democratic Republic of Congo , the  Comoros , and  Zimbabwe . After apartheid ended, South Africa was readmitted to the  Commonwealth of Nations . As the  Union of South Africa , South Africa was a founding member of the  United Nations  and the then Prime Minister  Jan Smuts  wrote the preamble to its constitution. South Africa is currently a non-permanent member of the  United Nations Security Council  and has attracted controversy by voting against a resolution criticising the  Burmese  government in 2006 and against the implementation of sanctions against  Zimbabwe  in 2008. South Africa is a member of the  Group of 77  and chaired the organisation in 2006. South Africa is a member of the  South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone ,  Southern African Customs Union ,  World Trade Organization ,  International Monetary Fund ,  G20  and  G8+5 .   The South African  armed forces , known as the  South African National Defence Force  (SANDF), was created in 1994. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  Previously known as the  South African Defence Force  (SADF), the new force is an all volunteer army and consists of the forces of the old SADF, as well as the forces of the African nationalist groups, namely  Umkhonto we Sizwe  (MK),  Azanian People's Liberation Army  (APLA), and the former  Bantustan  defence forces. [ 21 ]  The SANDF is subdivided into four branches, the  South African Army , the  South African Air Force , the  South African Navy , and the  South African Military Health Services . [ 23 ]   In recent years, the SANDF has become a major  peacekeeping  force in Africa, [ 24 ]  and has been involved in operations in  Lesotho , the  Democratic Republic of the Congo , [ 24 ]  and  Burundi , [ 24 ]  amongst others. It has also participated as a part of multi-national  UN  peacekeeping forces.   South Africa undertook a nuclear weapons programme in the 1970s [ 25 ]  and  may have conducted  a nuclear test over the  Atlantic  in 1979. [ 26 ]  It is the only African country to have successfully  developed nuclear weapons . It has become the first country (followed by Ukraine) with nuclear capability to voluntarily renounce and dismantle its programme and in the process signed the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty  in 1991. [ 25 ]     Provinces, districts and municipalities       Main articles:  Provinces of South Africa ,  Districts of South Africa , and  Municipalities of South Africa              Map showing the provinces and districts (numbered) of South Africa.             Northern Cape          North West          Gauteng          Limpopo          Mpumalanga            KwaZulu-Natal          Eastern Cape          Free State          Western Cape               When apartheid ended in 1994, the South African government had to integrate the formerly independent and semi-independent  Bantustans  into the political structure of South Africa. To this end, it abolished the four former provinces of South Africa ( Cape Province ,  Natal ,  Orange Free State , and  Transvaal ) and replaced them with nine fully integrated provinces. The new provinces are usually much smaller than the former provinces, which theoretically gives local governments more resources to distribute over smaller areas.   The nine provinces are further subdivided into  52 districts :  6 metropolitan  and  46 district municipalities . The 46 district municipalities are further subdivided into  231 local municipalities . The district municipalities also contain 20 district management areas (mostly game parks) that are directly governed by the district municipalities. The six metropolitan municipalities perform the functions of both district and local municipalities. The new provinces are:       Province   Former homelands and provinces   Capital   Area (km)   Area (sq mi)   Population (2001)       Eastern Cape   Cape Province ,  Transkei ,  Ciskei   Bhisho   169,580   65,475   6,436,761       Free State   Orange Free State ,  QwaQwa   Bloemfontein   129,480   49,992   2,706,776       Gauteng   Transvaal   Johannesburg   17,010   6,568   8,837,172       KwaZulu-Natal   Natal ,  KwaZulu   Pietermaritzburg   92,100   35,560   9,426,018       Limpopo   Transvaal ,  Venda ,  Lebowa ,  Gazankulu   Polokwane   123,900   47,838   5,273,637       Mpumalanga   Transvaal ,  KwaNdebele ,  KaNgwane ,  Bophuthatswana ,  Lebowa   Nelspruit   79,490   30,691   3,122,994       Northern Cape   Cape Province   Kimberley   361,830   139,703   822,726       North West   Transvaal ,  Cape Province ,  Bophuthatswana   Mafikeng   116,320   44,911   3,669,349       Western Cape   Cape Province   Cape Town   129,370   49,950   4,524,335       Total   1,219,080   470,688   44,819,768         Geography       Main article:  Geography of South Africa              Map of South Africa       South Africa is located at the southernmost region of Africa, with a long  coastline  that stretches more than 2,500 kilometres (1,550 mi) and across two  oceans  (the South  Atlantic  and the  Indian ). At 470,979  sq mi  (1,219,912 km), [ 27 ]  South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world (after  Mali ). It is comparable in size to  Colombia .  Njesuthi  in the  Drakensberg  at 3,408 m (11,424 ft) is the highest peak in South Africa.          View of the  Drakensberg mountains , the highest mountain range in South Africa.       South Africa has a generally  temperate climate , due in part to it being surrounded by the  Atlantic  and  Indian Oceans  on three sides, by its location in the climatically milder  southern hemisphere  and due to the average elevation rising steadily towards the north (towards the  equator ) and further inland. Due to this varied topography and oceanic influence, a great variety of climatic zones exist.   The climatic zones vary, from the extreme  desert  of the southern  Namib  in the farthest northwest to the lush  subtropical  climate in the east along the  Mozambique  border and the  Indian  ocean. From the east, the land quickly rises over a  mountainous   escarpment  towards the interior  plateau  known as the  Highveld . Even though South Africa is classified as  semi-arid , there is considerable variation in  climate  as well as  topography .   The interior of South Africa is a vast, rather flat, and sparsely populated  scrubland ,  Karoo , which is drier towards the northwest along the Namib desert. In contrast, the eastern coastline is lush and well-watered, which produces a climate similar to the tropics. The extreme southwest has a climate remarkably similar to that of the  Mediterranean  with wet winters and hot, dry summers, hosting the famous  Fynbos   Biome . This area also produces much of the  wine  in South Africa. This region is also particularly known for its wind, which blows intermittently almost all year. The severity of this wind made passing around the  Cape of Good Hope  particularly treacherous for sailors, causing many  shipwrecks . Further east on the south coast, rainfall is distributed more evenly throughout the year, producing a green landscape. This area is popularly known as the  Garden Route .          Satellite picture of South Africa       The  Free State  is particularly flat due to the fact that it lies centrally on the high plateau. North of the  Vaal River , the Highveld becomes better watered and does not experience subtropical extremes of heat.  Johannesburg , in the centre of the Highveld, is at 1,740 metres (5,709 ft) and receives an annual rainfall of 760 millimetres (30  in ). Winters in this region are cold, although  snow  is rare.   To the north of Johannesburg, the altitude drops beyond the escarpment of the Highveld, and turns into the lower lying Bushveld, an area of mixed dry forest and an abundance of wildlife. East of the Highveld, beyond the eastern escarpment, the Lowveld stretches towards the  Indian  ocean. It has particularly high temperatures, and is also the location of extended subtropical agriculture.   The high  Drakensberg mountains , which form the south-eastern escarpment of the Highveld, offer limited  skiing  opportunities in winter. The coldest place in South Africa is  Sutherland  in the western  Roggeveld Mountains , where midwinter temperatures can reach as low as 15 degrees  Celsius  (5  F ). The deep interior has the hottest temperatures: A temperature of 51.7 C (125 F) was recorded in 1948 in the  Northern Cape  Kalahari near  Upington . [ 28 ]   South Africa also has one possession, the small sub-Antarctic archipelago of the  Prince Edward Islands , consisting of  Marion Island  (290 km/112 sq mi) and Prince Edward Island (45 km/17.3 sq mi) (not to be confused with the  Canadian province of the same name ).           Weather averages for Cape Town, South Africa         Month   Jan   Feb   Mar   Apr   May   Jun   Jul   Aug   Sep   Oct   Nov   Dec   Year       Average high C (F)   27  (81)   28  (82)   26  (79)   24  (75)   20  (68)   18  (64)   17  (63)   18  (64)   19  (66)   22  (72)   24  (75)   26  (79)   28  (82)       Average low C (F)   16  (61)   16  (61)   15  (59)   13  (55)   10  (50)   8  (46)   8  (46)   8  (46)   9  (48)   11  (52)   14  (57)   15  (59)   8  (46)       Precipitation  mm (inches)   16.5  (0.65)   13  (0.51)   20  (0.79)   54  (2.13)   92  (3.62)   111  (4.37)   96  (3.78)   87  (3.43)   56  (2.2)   40  (1.57)   24  (0.94)   18  (0.71)   627  (24.69)       Source: EuroWEATHER [ 29 ]  2008-02-22         Flora and fauna     See also:  Wildlife of South Africa   See also:  Protected areas of South Africa             Fynbos , a  floral kingdom  unique to South Africa, is found near  Cape Town               Swartberg  mountains near the town of  Oudtshoorn              A field of flowers in Weskus National Park.       South Africa is one of only 17 countries worldwide considered  megadiverse . It has more than 20,000 different  plants , or about 10% of all the known  species  of plants on  Earth , making it particularly rich in plant biodiversity. South Africa is the 6th most biodiverse country, [ 30 ]  after  Brazil ,  Colombia ,  Indonesia ,  China , and  Mexico . The most prevalent biome in South Africa is the  grassland , particularly on the  Highveld , where the plant cover is dominated by different  grasses , low  shrubs , and  acacia trees , mainly camel-thorn and whitethorn.  Vegetation  becomes even more sparse towards the northwest due to low  rainfall . There are several species of water-storing  succulents  like  aloes  and euphorbias in the very hot and dry  Namaqualand  area. The grass and thorn  savannah  turns slowly into a bush savannah towards the north-east of the country, with denser growth. There are significant numbers of  baobab  trees in this area, near the northern end of  Kruger National Park . [ 31 ]   The  Fynbos   Biome , which makes up the majority of the area and plant life in the  Cape floristic region , one of the six  floral kingdoms , is located in a small region of the  Western Cape  and contains more than 9,000 of those species, making it among the richest regions on earth in terms of floral biodiversity. The majority of the plants are  evergreen  hard-leaf plants with fine, needle-like  leaves , such as the  sclerophyllous  plants. Another uniquely South African plant is the  protea  genus of flowering plants. There are around 130 different species of protea in South Africa.   While South Africa has a great wealth of flowering plants, it has few  forests . Only 1% of South Africa is forest, almost exclusively in the  humid   coastal plain  along the  Indian Ocean  in  KwaZulu-Natal  (see  KwaZulu-Cape coastal forest mosaic ). There are even smaller reserves of forests that are out of the reach of  fire , known as montane forests (see  Knysna-Amatole montane forests ).  Plantations  of imported tree species are predominant, particularly the non-native  eucalyptus  and  pine . South Africa has lost a large area of natural habitat in the last four decades, primarily due to  overpopulation , sprawling development patterns and  deforestation  during the nineteenth century. South Africa is one of the worst affected countries in the world when it comes to invasion by alien species with many (e.g.  Black Wattle ,  Port Jackson ,  Hakea ,  Lantana  and  Jacaranda ) posing a significant threat to the native  biodiversity  and the already scarce water resources. The original  temperate forest  that met the first European settlers to South Africa was exploited ruthlessly until only small patches remained. Currently, South African  hardwood  trees like  Real Yellowwood   (Podocarpus latifolius) ,  stinkwood   (Ocotea bullata) , and South African  Black Ironwood   (Olea laurifolia)  are under government protection.   Numerous  mammals  are found in the  bushveld  habitats including  lions ,  leopards ,  white rhinos ,  blue wildebeest ,  kudus ,  impalas ,  hyenas ,  hippopotamus  and  giraffes . A significant extent of the bushveld habitat exists in the north-east including  Kruger National Park  and the  Mala Mala  Reserve, as well as in the far north in the  Waterberg Biosphere .   Climate change is expected to bring considerable warming and drying to much of this already semi-arid region, with greater frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, flooding and drought. According to computer generated climate modelling produced by the South African National Biodiversity Institute [ 32 ]  parts of southern Africa will see an increase in temperature by about one degree Celsius along the coast to more than four degrees Celsius in the already hot hinterland such as the  Northern Cape  in late spring and summertime by 2050.   The Cape Floral Kingdom has been identified as one of the global  biodiversity hotspots  since it will be hit very hard by  climate change  and has such a great diversity of life. Drought, increased intensity and frequency of fire and climbing temperatures are expected to push many of these  rare species  towards  extinction .   South Africa houses many endemic species, among them the  critically endangered   Riverine Rabbit  ( Bunolagus monticullaris ) in the  Karoo .     Economy       Main article:  Economy of South Africa              The  Victoria & Alfred Waterfront  in  Cape Town  with  Table Mountain  in the background. Cape Town has become an important  retail  and  tourism  centre for the country, and attracts the largest number of foreign visitors in South Africa       By  UN  classification South Africa is a middle-income country with an abundant supply of resources, well-developed financial, legal, communications, energy, and transport sectors, a  stock exchange  (the  JSE Limited ), that ranks among the top twenty in the world, and a modern infrastructure supporting an efficient distribution of goods to major urban centres throughout the entire region. South Africa is ranked 25th in the world in terms of  GDP  (PPP) as of 2007.   Advanced development is significantly localised around four areas: Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Durban, and Pretoria/Johannesburg. Beyond these four economic centres, development is marginal and poverty is still prevalent despite government efforts. Consequently the vast majority of South Africans are poor. However, key marginal areas have experienced rapid growth recently. Such areas include Mossel Bay to Plettenberg Bay; Rustenburg area; Nelspruit area; Bloemfontein; Cape West Coast; and the KwaZulu-Natal North Coast.   Even though South Africa has the seventh highest per capita income in Africa, only behind  Libya ,  Mauritius  it suffers from large income gaps and a  dual economy  marking it as a  developing country . South Africa has one of the highest rates of  income inequality  in the world. A decade of continual economic growth has helped to lower unemployment, but daunting economic and social problems remain. The average South African household income decreased considerably between 1995 and 2000. As for racial inequality,  Statistics South Africa  reported that in 1995 the average white household earned four times as much as the average black household. In 2000 the average white household was earning six times more than the average black household. [ 33 ]  The  affirmative action  policies have seen a rise in black economic wealth and an emerging black middle class. [ 34 ]  Other problems are crime, corruption, and  HIV / AIDS .   At the start of 2000, then President Thabo Mbeki vowed to promote economic growth and foreign investment by relaxing restrictive labour laws, stepping up the pace of  privatisation , and cutting unneeded governmental spending. His policies face strong opposition from organised  labour . South Africa is also the largest energy producer and consumer on the continent. South Africa is a popular tourist destination, and a substantial amount of revenue comes from tourism. [ 35 ]  Among the main attractions are the diverse and picturesque culture, the game reserves and the highly regarded local wines.   The South African  rand  (ZAR), is the most actively traded emerging  market currency  in the world. It has joined an elite club of fifteen currencies, the  Continuous linked settlement  (CLS), where forex transactions are settled immediately, lowering the risks of transacting across  time zones . The rand was the best-performing currency against the  United States dollar  (USD) between 2002 and 2005, according to the  Bloomberg  Currency Scorecard.   The volatility of the  rand  has affected economic activity, falling sharply during 2001 and hitting a historic low of 13.85  ZAR  to the  USD , raising fears of inflation, and causing the Reserve Bank to increase  interest rates . The rand has since recovered, trading at 7.13 ZAR to the dollar as of January 2008. However, as exporters are put under considerable pressure from a stronger domestic currency, many call for government intervention to help soften the rand.   Refugees from poorer neighbouring countries include many immigrants from the DRC, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Malawi and others, representing a large portion of the informal sector. With high unemployment levels amongst poorer South Africans,  xenophobia  is prevalent and many people born in South Africa feel resentful of immigrants who are seen to be depriving the native population of jobs, a feeling which has been given credibility by the fact that many South African employers have employed migrants from other countries for lower pay than South African citizens, especially in the  construction ,  tourism ,  agriculture  and  domestic service  industries. Illegal immigrants are also heavily involved in informal trading. [ 36 ]  However, many immigrants to South Africa continue to live in poor conditions, and the South African immigration policy has become increasingly restrictive since 1994. [ 37 ]   Principal international trading partners of South Africa  besides other African countries  include  Germany ,  Japan ,  Switzerland , the  United Kingdom , and the  United States . Chief exports include  corn ,  diamonds ,  fruits ,  gold ,  metals  and  minerals ,  sugar , and  wool .  Machinery  and transportation equipment make up more than one-third of the value of the countrys imports. Other imports include  chemicals , manufactured goods, and  petroleum .     Electricity crisis   After unsuccessful attempts by the government to encourage private construction of electricity generation capacity, in 2007 the state-owned electricity supplier ( Eskom ) started experiencing a lack of capacity in the electrical generating and reticulation infrastructure. This led to an inability to meet the routine demands of industry and consumers, resulting in countrywide  rolling blackouts . Initially the lack of capacity was triggered by a failure at  Koeberg nuclear power station , but since then a general lack of capacity became evident. The supplier has been widely criticised for failing to adequately plan for and construct sufficient electrical generating capacity, [ 38 ]  although ultimately the government has admitted that it is at fault for refusing to approve funding for investment in infrastructure. [ 39 ]     Agriculture          Workers planting on a farm in the central area of  Mpumalanga .               Farm  workers.       South Africa has a large agricultural sector and is a net exporter of  farming  products. There are almost a thousand  agricultural cooperatives  and  agribusinesses  throughout the country, and agricultural exports have constituted 8% of South African total exports for the past five years. The agricultural industry contributes around 10% of formal employment, relatively low compared to other parts of Africa, as well as providing work for casual labourers and contributing around 2.6% of  GDP  for the nation. [ 40 ]  However, due to the  aridity  of the land, only 13.5% can be used for crop production, and only 3% is considered high potential land. [ 41 ]   Although the commercial farming sector is relatively well developed, people in some rural areas still survive on  subsistence agriculture . It is the eighth largest wine producer in the world, and the eleventh largest producer of sunflower seed. South Africa is a net exporter of agricultural products and foodstuffs, the largest number of exported items being  sugar ,  grapes ,  citrus ,  nectarines ,  wine  and  deciduous  fruit. The largest locally produced crop is  maize  (corn), and it has been estimated that 9 million tons are produced every year, with 7.4 million tons being consumed.  Livestock  are also popular on South African farms, with the country producing 85% of all meat consumed. The dairy industry consists of around 4,300 milk producers providing employment for 60,000 farm workers and contributing to the livelihoods of around 40,000 others. [ 42 ]   In recent years, the agricultural sector has introduced several reforms, some of which are controversial, such as  land reform  and the deregulation of the market for agricultural products. Land reform has been criticised both by farmers' groups and by landless workers, the latter alleging that the pace of change has not been fast enough, and the former alleging racist treatment and expressing concerns that a similar situation to  Zimbabwe's land reform policy  may develop, [ 43 ]  a fear exacerbated by comments made by  deputy president , the deputy president of South Africa. [ 44 ] [ 45 ]  The sector continues to face problems, with increased foreign competition and crime being two of the major challenges for the industry. The government has been accused of either putting in too much effort [ 46 ] , or not enough effort [ 47 ] , to tackle the problem of  farm attacks  as opposed to other forms of violent crime.   Another issue which affects South African agriculture is environmental damage caused by misuse of the land and global climate change. South Africa is unusually vulnerable to climate change and resultant diminution of surface waters. Some predictions show surface water supply could decrease by 60% by the year 2070 in parts of the Western Cape. [ 48 ]  To reverse the damage caused by land mismanagement, the government has supported a scheme which promotes  sustainable development  and the use of natural resources. [ 49 ]  Maize production, which contributes to a 36% majority of the gross value of South Africas field crops, has also experienced negative effects due to climate change. The estimated value of loss, which takes into consideration scenarios with and without the carbon dioxide fertilization effect [2]  ,ranges between 10s to 100s of millions of Rands.

The western half of South Africa is sparsely populated, while the eastern half has a high  population  concentration.              The many migrations that formed the modern  Rainbow Nation .       South Africa is a nation of more than 48 million people of diverse origins,  cultures ,  languages , and  religions . The last  census  was held in 2001 and the next will be in 2011.  Statistics South Africa  provided five  racial  categories by which people could classify themselves, the last of which, ""unspecified/other"" drew negligible responses, and these results were omitted. [ 51 ]  The 2006 midyear estimated figures for the other categories were  Black African  at 79.5%,  White  at 9.2%,  Coloured  at 8.9%, and  Indian or Asian  at 2.5%. [ 52 ]  Even though the population of South Africa has increased in the past decade [ 51 ] [ 53 ]  (primarily due to immigration), the country had an annual population growth rate of 0.501% in 2008 (CIA est.), including immigration. [ 54 ]  South Africa is home to an estimated 5 million  illegal immigrants , including some 3 million  Zimbabweans . [ 55 ] [ 56 ] [ 57 ]  A series of  anti-immigrant riots  occurred in South Africa beginning on 11 May 2008. [ 58 ] [ 59 ]   By far the major part of the population classified itself as African or black, but it is not culturally or linguistically homogeneous. Major ethnic groups include the  Zulu ,  Xhosa ,  Basotho  (South Sotho),  Bapedi  (North Sotho),  Venda ,  Tswana ,  Tsonga ,  Swazi  and  Ndebele , all of which speak  Bantu languages  (see  Bantu peoples of South Africa ).   Some, such as the Zulu, Xhosa, Bapedi and Venda groups, are unique to South Africa. Other groups are distributed across the borders with neighbours of South Africa: The  Basotho  group is also the major ethnic group in  Lesotho . The  Tswana  ethnic group constitute the majority of the population of  Botswana . The  Swazi  ethnic group is the major ethnic group in  Swaziland . The  Ndebele  ethnic group is also found in  Matabeleland  in  Zimbabwe , where they are known as the  Matabele . These Ndebele people are the descendants of a Zulu faction under the warrior  Mzilikazi  that escaped persecution from  Shaka  by migrating to their current territory. The  Tsonga  ethnic group is also found in southern  Mozambique , where they are known as the Shangaan.   The white population is not ethnically homogenous and descend from many ethnic groups:  Dutch ,  Flemish ,  Portuguese , German, French  Huguenot , English, Irish, Italian, Scottish and  Welsh . Culturally and linguistically, they are divided into the  Afrikaners , who speak  Afrikaans , and English-speaking groups, many of whom are descended from British and Irish immigrants (see  Anglo-African ). Many small communities that have immigrated over the last century retain the use of other languages. The  white population  is on the decrease due to a low birth rate and emigration; as a factor in their decision to emigrate, many cite the high  crime  rate and the  affirmative action  policies of the government. Since 1994, approximately 1 000 000 white South Africans have permanently emigrated. [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ] [ 63 ]  Despite high emigration levels, a high level of non-South African white immigrants have settled in the country, in particular from countries such as  Britain  and  Zimbabwe . For example, by 2005, an estimated 212 000 British citizens were residing in South Africa. Since 2003, the numbers of British migrants coming to South Africa has risen by 50%. An estimated 20 000 British migrants moved to South Africa in 2007. There have also been a significant number of  white Zimbabwean  arrivals, fleeing their home country in light of the economic and political problems currently facing the country. As well as recent arrivals, a significant number of white Zimbabweans emigrated to South Africa in the wake of independence in Zimbabwe in 1980. Some of the more nostalgic members of the community are known in popular culture as "" Whenwes "", because of their nostalgia for their lives in  Rhodesia  ""when we were in Rhodesia"". [ 64 ]   The term  Coloured  is still largely used for the people of mixed race descended from slaves brought in from East and Central Africa, the indigenous  Khoisan  who lived in the  Cape  at the time, Bantus, Whites (mostly the  Dutch / Afrikaner  and British settlers) as well as an admixture of  Javanese ,  Malay , Indian,  Malagasy  and Asian blood (such as  Burmese ). The majority speak Afrikaans. Khoisan is a term used to describe two separate groups, physically similar: light-skinned and small in stature. The  Khoikhoi , who were called  Hottentots  by the Europeans, were pastoralists and were annihilated; the San, called  Bushmen  by the Europeans, were hunter-gatherers. Within the Coloured community, more recent immigrants will also be found: Coloureds from the former  Rhodesia  (now  Zimbabwe );  Namibia  and immigrants of mixed descent from India and  Burma  ( Anglo-Indians / Anglo-Burmese ) who were welcomed to the Cape when India and Burma received their Independence.   The major part of the South African  Asian  population is Indian in origin (see  Indian South Africans ); many of them descended from indentured workers brought in the nineteenth century to work on the  sugar   plantations  of the eastern coastal area then known as  Natal . There is also a significant group of  Chinese South Africans  (approximately 100,000 individuals) and  Vietnamese  South Africans (approximately 50,000 individuals). In 2008, the Pretoria High Court has ruled that Chinese South Africans who arrived before 1994 are to be reclassified as  Coloureds . As a result of this ruling, about 12,000 - 15,000  [ 65 ] ethnically Chinese citizens who arrived before 1994, numbering 3%-5% of the total Chinese population in the country, will be able to benefit from government  BEE  policies. [ 66 ]   South Africa hosts a sizeable refugee and asylum seeker population. According to the  World Refugee Survey 2008 , published by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, this population numbered approximately 144,700 in 2007. [ 67 ]  Groups of refugees and asylum seekers numbering over 10,000 included people from  Zimbabwe  (48,400), The  Democratic Republic of the Congo  (24,800), and  Somalia  (12,900). [ 67 ]  These populations mainly lived in Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban, Cape Town, and Port Elizabeth. [ 67 ]     Science and technology   Several important scientific and technological developments have originated in South Africa.  The first human to human heart transplant was performed by cardiac surgeon  Christiaan Barnard  at  Groote Schuur Hospital  in December 1967  .  Max Theiler  developed a vaccine against Yellow Fever,  Allan McLeod Cormack  pioneered x-ray  Computed tomography , and  Aaron Klug  developed crystallographic electron microscopy techniques. These advancements were all recognized with  Nobel Prizes .  Sydney Brenner  won most recently, in 2002, for his pioneering work in  molecular biology .   Mark Shuttleworth  founded an early Internet security company  Thawte , that was subsequently bought out by world-leader  VeriSign . Despite government efforts to encourage entrepreneurship in biotechnology, IT and other high technology fields, no other notable groundbreaking companies have been founded in South Africa. However, it is the expressed objective of the government to transition the economy to be more reliant on high technology, based on the realization that South African cannot compete with Far Eastern economies in manufacturing, nor can the republic rely on its mineral wealth in perpetuity.   South Africa has cultivated a burgeoning astronomy community. It hosts the  Southern African Large Telescope , the largest optical telescope in the southern hemisphere. South Africa is currently building the  Karoo Array Telescope  as a pathfinder for the $20 billion  Square Kilometer Array  project. South Africa is a finalist, with Australia, to be the host of the SKA.     Society and culture       Main article:  Culture of South Africa              Decorated houses,  Drakensberg Mountains              Traditional  South African cuisine .       It may be argued that there is no ""single"" culture in South Africa because of its ethnic diversity. Today, the diversity in foods from many cultures is enjoyed by all and especially marketed to tourists who wish to sample the large variety of South African cuisine. In addition to  food ,  music  and  dance  feature prominently.   South African cuisine  is heavily  meat-based  and has spawned the distinctively South African social gathering known as a  braai , or barbecue. South Africa has also developed into a major  wine  producer, with some of the best  vineyards  lying in valleys around  Stellenbosch ,  Franschoek ,  Paarl  and  Barrydale . [ 68 ]   There is great diversity in music from South Africa. Many black musicians who sang in Afrikaans or English during apartheid have since begun to sing in traditional African languages, and have developed a unique style called  Kwaito . Of note is  Brenda Fassie , who launched to fame with her song ""Weekend Special"", which was sung in English. More famous traditional musicians include  Ladysmith Black Mambazo , while the  Soweto String Quartet  performs classic music with an African flavour. White and Coloured South African singers are historically influenced by European musical styles including such western metal bands such as  Seether  (formerly Saron Gas). South Africa has produced world-famous jazz musicians, notably  Hugh Masekela ,  Jonas Gwangwa ,  Abdullah Ibrahim ,  Miriam Makeba ,  Jonathan Butler ,  Chris McGregor , and  Sathima Bea Benjamin .  Afrikaans  music covers multiple genres, such as the  contemporary   Steve Hofmeyr  and the  punk rock  band  Fokofpolisiekar . Crossover artists such as  Johnny Clegg  and his bands  Juluka  and  Savuka  have enjoyed various success underground, publicly, and abroad.   The South African black majority still has a substantial number of rural inhabitants who lead largely impoverished lives. It is among these people, however, that cultural traditions survive most strongly; as blacks have become increasingly  urbanised  and  westernised , aspects of traditional culture have declined. Urban blacks usually speak English or  Afrikaans  in addition to their native tongue. There are smaller but still significant groups of speakers of  Khoisan languages  who are not included in the eleven official languages, but are one of the eight other officially recognised languages. There are small groups of speakers of  endangered languages , most of which are from the Khoi-San family, that receive no official status; however, some groups within South Africa are attempting to promote their use and revival.   The  middle class  lifestyle, predominantly of the white minority but with growing numbers of Black, Coloured and Indian people, [ 69 ]  is similar in many respects to that of people found in  Western Europe , North America and  Australasia . Members of the middle class often study and work abroad for greater exposure to the markets of the world.   Asians , predominantly of Indian origin, preserve their own cultural heritage, languages and religious beliefs, being either  Christian ,  Hindu  or  Sunni Muslim  and speaking English, with Indian languages like  Hindi ,  Telugu ,  Tamil  or  Gujarati  being spoken less frequently, but the majority of Indians being able to understand their mother tongue. The first Indians arrived on the famous  Truro ship  as  indentured labourers  in Natal to work the Sugar Cane Fields. There is a much smaller  Chinese  community in South Africa, although its numbers have increased due to immigration from  Republic of China  (Taiwan).   South Africa has also had a large influence in the  Scouting  movement, with many Scouting traditions and ceremonies coming from the experiences of  Robert Baden-Powell  (the founder of Scouting) during his time in South Africa as a military officer in the 1890s. The  South African Scout Association  was one of the first youth organisations to open its doors to youth and adults of all races in South Africa. This happened on 2 July 1977 at a conference known as  Quo Vadis . [ 70 ]   The South African music scene consists of  Kwaito , a new music genre that had developed in the mid 80s and has since developed to become the most popular social economical form of representation among the populous. Though some may argue that the political aspects of Kwaito has since diminished after  Apartheid , and the relative interest in politics has become a minor aspect of daily life. Some argue that in a sense,  Kwaito  is in fact a political force that shows activism in its apolitical actions. Today, major corporations like  Sony ,  BMG , and  EMI  have appeared on the South African scene to produce and distribute  Kwaito  music. Due to its overwhelming popularity, as well as the general influence of DJs, who are among the top 5 most influential types of people within the country,  Kwaito  has taken over radio, television, and magazines. [ 71 ]   Kwaito , much like most hip-hop has its own local flavor and originality. However, unlike when hip-hop first burst on the scene as a politically driven and rebellious underground movement, South Africans wanted to create a happier vibe. As the post-apartheid fog cleared, South African youth found their ""own voice in a style of music known as kwaito, spawning a new (and profitable) industry"". [ 72 ]  According to TIMEeurope magazine, ""The kwaito sound now regularly incorporates traditional African music, jazz, gospel, and even rock guitar, most notably on Mandoza's 2000 hit Nkalakatha, one of the few kwaito records to cross over onto traditionally white radio"". [ 73 ]  In the kwaito, the samples from old school  Jamaican dancehall , European house, etc.,  tempos  are changed, beats are added, and urban street slang is also incorporated. This local flavor of music more recently has been attacked for its lack of ingenuity and its betrayal of its roots. The melodies and the incorporation of sex and dance have since become very similar to the American standard. In addition Kwaito has been criticised for its absence of influential lyrical content. As Kwaito is still a developing genre, and since the South African population is only around 48 million, sales of only 25,000 CDs are required for ""gold"" certification in South Africa. [ 72 ]     Religion       Main article:  Religion in South Africa               St. Mark 's Anglican Cathedral.       According to the latest 2001 national census, Christians accounted for 79.7% of the population. This includes  Zion Christian  11.1%,  Pentecostal  ( Charismatic ) 8.2%,  Roman Catholic  7.1%,  Methodist  6.8%,  Dutch Reformed  6.7%,  Anglican  3.8%, and other Christian 36%.  Islam  accounted for 1.5% of the population,  Hinduism  about 1.3%, and  Judaism  0.2%. 15.1% had no religious affiliation, 2.3% were other and 1.4% were unspecified. [ 74 ] [ 75 ]   African Indigenous Churches were the largest of the  Christian  groups. It was believed that many of these persons who claimed no affiliation with any organised religion adhered to  traditional indigenous religions . Many peoples have  syncretic  religious practices combining Christian and indigenous influences. [ 76 ]   Islam in South Africa  itself is not known to pre-date the colonial period, despite the isolated contact neighbouring  Mozambique  had with  Arab  and  East African  traders. [ citation needed ]  There is no evidence that Islam was known to the  Zulu ,  Swazi , or  Xhosa  of the east coast prior to the colonial era. Many South African Muslims are described as  Coloureds , notably in the  Western Cape , especially those whose ancestors came as slaves from the Indonesian archipelago (the  Cape Malays ). Others are described as  Indians , notably in  KwaZulu-Natal , including those whose ancestors came as traders from  South Asia ; they have been joined by others from other parts of Africa as well as white or black South African converts. It is estimated that  Islam  is the fastest growing religion of conversion in the country, [ 77 ]  with the number of black  Muslims  growing sixfold, from 12,000 in 1991 to 74,700 in 2004. [ 78 ]   Hinduism  dates back to British Colonial period primarily but later waves of continuous immigrants from India have contributed to a sizable Hindu population. Most Hindus are ethnically South Asian but there are many who come from mixed racial stock and many are converts with the efforts of Hindu missionaries such as ISKCON. Other religions in smaller numbers are  Sikhism ,  Jainism  and  Bah' Faith . [ 75 ]     Languages       Main article:  Languages of South Africa              Map showing principal South African languages by municipality. Lighter shades indicate a non-majority  plurality .             Afrikaans          Northern Sotho          Southern Sotho          Swati          Tsonga            Tswana          Venda          Xhosa          Zulu               South Africa has eleven  official languages : [ 79 ]   Sepedi ,  Sesotho ,  Setswana ,  siSwati ,  Tshivenda ,  Xitsonga ,  Afrikaans ,  English ,  isiNdebele ,  isiXhosa  and  isiZulu . In this regard it is  second only to India  in number. While each language is formally equal to every other, some languages are spoken more than others. According to the 2001 National Census, the three most spoken first home languages are Zulu (23.8%), Xhosa (17.6%) and Afrikaans (13.3%). [ 51 ]  Despite the fact that English is recognised as the language of commerce and science, it was spoken by only 8.2% of South Africans at home in 2001, an even lower percentage than in 1996 (8.6%). [ 51 ]   There are  eleven official names  for South Africa, one in each of the official national languages. The country also recognises eight non-official languages:  Fanagalo ,  Khoe ,  Lobedu ,  Nama ,  Northern Ndebele ,  Phuthi ,  San  and  South African Sign Language . [ citation needed ]  These non-official languages may be used in certain official uses in limited areas where it has been determined that these languages are prevalent. Nevertheless, their populations are not such that they require nationwide recognition.   Many of the ""unofficial languages"" of the  San  and  Khoikhoi  people contain regional  dialects  stretching northward into Namibia and Botswana, and elsewhere. These people, who are a physically distinct population from other Africans, have their own cultural identity based on their  hunter-gatherer  societies. They have been marginalised to a great extent, and many of their languages are in danger of becoming  extinct .   Many white South Africans also speak other European languages, such as  Portuguese  (also spoken by Angolan and Mozambican blacks), German, and  Greek , while some  Asians  and  Indians  in South Africa speak  South Asian  languages, such as  Tamil ,  Hindi ,  Gujarati ,  Urdu  and  Telugu .  French  is still widely spoken by French South Africans especially in places like  Franschhoek , where many South Africans are of French origin. South African French is spoken by less than 10,000 individuals. Congolese French is also spoken in South Africa by migrants.

Other sports with significant support are  swimming ,  golf  and  netball .  Basketball ,  surfing  and  skateboarding  are popular among the youth.   Famous boxing personalities include Baby Jake  Jacob Matlala ,  Vuyani Bungu ,  Welcome Ncita ,  Dingaan Thobela ,  Gerrie Coetzee  and  Brian Mitchell . Football players who have excelled in international clubs include  Lucas Radebe  of  Leeds United  and  Quinton Fortune , formerly of  Manchester United ,  Benni McCarthy  and  Aaron Mokoena  of  Blackburn Rovers  and  Steven Pienaar  of  Everton . South Africa produced  Formula 1  motor racing's 1979 world champion  Jody Scheckter .   South Africa hosted and won the  1995 Rugby World Cup  at their first attempt and again won the  2007 Rugby World Cup  in  France . South Africa was only allowed to participate from 1995 since the end of  Apartheid . It followed the 1995 Rugby World Cup by hosting and winning the  1996 African Cup of Nations  football tournament. It also hosted the  2003 Cricket World Cup  and the  2007 World Twenty20 Championship . South Africa will be the host nation for the  2010 FIFA World Cup , which will be the first time the tournament is held on the African continent.   In 2004, the swim team of  Roland Schoeman ,  Lyndon Ferns ,  Darian Townsend  and  Ryk Neethling  won the gold medal at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, simultaneously breaking the world record in the 4x100 freestyle relay.  Penny Heyns  won Olympic Gold in the 1996  Atlanta Olympic Games .   In golf,  Gary Player  is generally regarded as one of the greatest golfers of all time, having won the  Career Grand Slam , one of five golfers to have done so. Other South African golfers to have successfully won a major tournament include  Bobby Locke ,  Ernie Els ,  Retief Goosen  and  Trevor Immelman .     Current issues     HIV/AIDS       Main article:  HIV/AIDS in South Africa       The spread of  AIDS  (acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome) is an alarming problem in South Africa with up to 31% of pregnant women found to be HIV infected in 2005 and the infection rate among adults estimated at 20%. [ 80 ]  The link between HIV, a virus spread primarily by sexual contact, and AIDS was long denied by prior president  Thabo Mbeki  and then health minister  Manto Tshabalala-Msimang , who insisted that the many deaths in the country are due to malnutrition, and hence poverty, and not HIV. [ 81 ]  In 2007, in response to international pressure, the government made efforts to fight AIDS. [ 82 ]  In September 2008 Thabo Mbeki was ousted by the ANC and  Kgalema Motlanthe  was appointed for the interim. One of Mr. Motlanthe's first actions was to replace Mrs. Tshabalala-Msimang with the current minister,  Barbara Hogan .   AIDS affects mainly those who are sexually active and is far more prevalent in the black population. Most deaths are people who are also economically active, resulting in many families losing their primary wage earners. This has resulted in many 'AIDS orphans' who in many cases depend on the state for care and financial support. [ 83 ]  It is estimated that there are 1,200,000 orphans in South Africa. [ 83 ]  Many elderly people also lose the support from lost younger members of their family. Roughly 5 million people are infected with the disease. [ 82 ]     Crime       Main article:  Crime in South Africa               Prison  buildings on  Robben Island       According to a survey for the period 19982000 compiled by the  United Nations , South Africa was ranked second for  murder  and first for  assaults  and  rapes  per capita. [ 84 ]  Total crime per capita is 10th out of the 60 countries in the data set.   Crime  has had a pronounced effect on society: many middle-class South Africans moved into  gated communities , abandoning the central business districts of some cities for the relative security of suburbs. This effect is most pronounced in  Johannesburg , although the trend is noticeable in other cities as well. [ citation needed ]  Many emigrants from South Africa also state that crime was a big motivator for them to leave.  Crime against the farming community  has continued to be a major problem. [ 85 ]     Skills migration   Along with many African nations, South Africa has been experiencing a "" brain drain "" in the past 20 years. This is believed to be potentially damaging for the regional economy, [ 86 ]  and is almost certainly detrimental for the well-being of the majority of people reliant on the healthcare infrastructure, given the HIV/AIDS epidemic. [ 87 ]  The skills drain in South Africa tends to demonstrate racial contours (naturally given the skills distribution legacy of South Africa) and has thus resulted in large white South African communities abroad. [ 88 ]     Xenophobia       Main article:  Xenophobia in South Africa       In May 2008 long standing state hostility to African migrants exploded in a series of pogroms that left up to 100 people dead and 100,000 displaced.

The South African coast stretches 2,798 kilometres (1,739 mi) [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  and borders both the  Atlantic  and  Indian   oceans . [ 7 ]  To the north of South Africa lie  Namibia ,  Botswana  and  Zimbabwe , to the east are  Mozambique  and  Swaziland , while the  Kingdom of Lesotho  is an independent  enclave  surrounded by South African territory. [ 8 ]   Modern human beings have inhabited South Africa for more than 100,000 years. [ 9 ]  A century and a half after the discovery of the  Cape Sea Route , the  Dutch East India Company   founded  a refreshment station at what would become  Cape Town  in 1652. [ 10 ]  Cape Town became a British colony in 1806. European settlement expanded during the 1820s as the  Boers  (original  Dutch ,  Flemish ,  German  and  French  settlers) and the British  1820 Settlers  claimed land in the north and east of the country. Conflicts arose among the Xhosa, Zulu and Afrikaner groups. However, the discovery of diamonds and later gold triggered the conflict known as the  Anglo-Boer War  as the Boers and the British fought for the control of the South African mineral wealth. Although the Boers were defeated, limited independence was given to South Africa in 1910 as a British dominion. Anti-British policies focused on ultimate independence which was achieved in 1961 when South Africa was declared a  republic . The leading  National Party  legislated for a continuation of racial segregation begun under Dutch and British colonial rule, Boer republics, and subsequent South African governments (and which in 1948 became legally institutionalized  segregation  known as  apartheid ), despite opposition both in and outside of the country. In 1990 the then president  F.W. de Klerk  began to dismantle this legislation, and in 1994 the first democratic election was held in South Africa. This election brought  Nelson Mandela  and the current ruling party, the  African National Congress  to power, and the country rejoined the  Commonwealth of Nations .   South Africa is known for its diversity in cultures, languages, and religious beliefs, and eleven official languages are recognised in its  constitution . [ 7 ]  English is the most commonly spoken language in official and commercial public life, however it is only the fifth most spoken home language. [ 7 ]  South Africa is ethnically diverse, with the largest  Caucasian ,  Indian , and  racially mixed  communities in Africa. Although 79.6% of the South African population is  Black , [ 2 ]  this category is neither culturally nor linguistically homogenous, as people within this classification speak a number of different  Bantu languages , nine of which have official status. [ 7 ]  Midyear 2007, the South African population was estimated at 47.9 million.

(September 2008)           Main article:  History of South Africa       South Africa contains some of the oldest archaeological sites in the world. [ 11 ]   [ 12 ]  Extensive fossil remains at the  Sterkfontein ,  Kromdraai  and Makapansgat caves suggest that various  australopithecines  existed in South Africa from about three million years ago. [ 13 ]  These were succeeded by various species of  Homo , including  Homo habilis ,  Homo erectus  and modern humans,  Homo sapiens . Settlements of  Bantu -speaking peoples, who were  iron -using agriculturists and herdsmen, were already present south of the  Limpopo River  by the fourth or fifth century (see  Bantu expansion ) displacing and absorbing the original  KhoiSan  speakers. They slowly moved south and the earliest ironworks in modern-day  KwaZulu-Natal Province  are believed to date from around 1050. The southernmost group was the  Xhosa  people, whose language incorporates certain linguistic traits from the earlier KhoiSan people, reaching the  Fish River , in today's  Eastern Cape Province . These  Iron Age  populations displaced earlier people, who often had  hunter-gatherer  societies, as they migrated.     European colonisation          Painting of an account of the arrival of  Jan van Riebeeck , the first  European  to settle in South Africa, with  Devil's Peak  in the background       In 1487, the  Portuguese  explorer  Bartolomeu Dias  became the first European to reach the southernmost point of Africa. Initially named The Cape of Storms, The King of Portugal,  John II , renamed it the  Cabo da Boa Esperana  or  Cape of Good Hope  as it led to the riches of India. This great feat of navigation was later immortalized in  Cames ' epic Portuguese poem,  The Lusiads  (1572). In 1652, a refreshment station was established at the  Cape of Good Hope  by  Jan van Riebeeck  on behalf of the  Dutch East India Company .  Slaves  were brought from  Indonesia ,  Madagascar , and India as a labour source for the Dutch immigrants in  Cape Town . As they expanded east, the Dutch settlers eventually met the south-westerly expanding  Xhosa  people in the region of the  Fish River . A series of wars, called the  Cape Frontier Wars , ensued, mainly caused by conflicting land and livestock interests.   Great Britain  took over the  Cape of Good Hope  area in 1795 ostensibly to stop it falling into the hands of the Revolutionary French, but also seeking to use  Cape Town  in particular as a stop on the route to Australia and India. It was later returned to the Dutch in 1803, but soon afterwards the  Dutch East India Company  declared bankruptcy, and the British annexed the Cape Colony in 1806. The British continued the frontier wars against the Xhosa, pushing the eastern frontier eastward through a line of forts established along the Fish River and consolidating it by encouraging  British settlement . Due to pressure of  abolitionist  societies in Britain, the  British parliament  first stopped its global  slave trade  with the passage of the  Slave Trade Act 1807 , then abolished slavery in all its colonies with the  Slavery Abolition Act 1833 . During the 1830s, approximately 12 000  Boers  (later known as  Voortrekkers ), departed from the  Cape Colony , where they were subjected to British control, to the future Natal, Orange Free State and Transvaal regions. The Boers founded the  Boer Republics  - the  South African Republic  (Now  Gauteng ,  Limpopo ,  Mpumalanga  and  North West  provinces) and the  Orange Free State  ( Free State ).   The discovery of  diamonds  in 1867 and  gold  in 1884 in the interior encouraged economic growth and immigration, intensifying the subjugation of the indigenous people. These important economic resources did not only play a role between European and the indigenous population but also between the Boers and the British. [ 14 ]   The  Boer Republics  successfully resisted British encroachments during the  First Boer War  (18801881) using  guerrilla warfare  tactics, much better suited to local conditions. However, the British returned in greater numbers, more experience, and more suitable tactics in the  Second Boer War  (18991902). The Boers' attempt to ally themselves with  German South-West Africa  provided the British with yet another excuse to take control of the Boer Republics. [ citation needed ]           Boers  in combat (1881).         Independence   After four years of negotiating, the  Union of South Africa  was created from the  Cape  and  Natal  colonies, as well as the republics of  Orange Free State  and  Transvaal , on 31 May 1910, exactly eight years after the end of the Second Boer War. The newly created Union of South Africa was a  dominion . The  Natives' Land Act  of 1913 severely restricted the ownership of land by 'blacks', at that stage to a mere 7% of the country, although this amount was eventually increased marginally. [ 15 ]  The union was effectively granted independence from the United Kingdom with the passage of the  Statute of Westminster , which morphed the  British king's  position within South Africa into that of the distinct  King of South Africa . In 1934, the  South African Party  and  National Party  merged to form the  United Party , seeking reconciliation between Afrikaners and English-speaking ""Whites"", but split in 1939 over the entry of the Union into  World War II  as an ally of the United Kingdom, a move which the National Party strongly opposed.   In 1948, the  National Party  was elected to power, and intensified the implementation of racial segregation that had begun under Dutch and British colonial rule, and subsequent South African governments since the Union was formed. The Nationalist Government systematised existing segregationist laws, and the system of segregation became known collectively as  apartheid . Not surprisingly, this segregation also applied to the wealth acquired during rapid industrialisation of the 1950s, '60s, and '70s. While the White minority enjoyed the highest  standard of living  in all of Africa, often comparable to  First World  western nations, the Black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard, including income, education, housing, and life expectancy. On 31 May 1961, following a whites-only  referendum , the country became a  republic  and left the (British)  Commonwealth . The office of  Governor-General  was abolished and replaced with the position of  State President .   Apartheid became increasingly controversial, leading to widespread  sanctions ,  divestment  and growing unrest and oppression within South Africa. (See also the article on the  History of South Africa in the apartheid era .) A long period of harsh suppression by the government, and at times violent resistance,  strikes , marches, protests, and  sabotage  by bombing and other means, by various anti-apartheid movements, most notably the  African National Congress  (ANC), followed. In the late 1970s, South Africa began a programme of  nuclear weapons  development and in the following decade it produced six deliverable nuclear weapons. The rationale for the nuclear arsenal is disputed, but it is believed [ who? ]  that  Vorster  and  P.W. Botha  wanted to be able to catalyse American intervention in the event of a war between South Africa and the  Cuban -supported  MPLA  government of  Angola .     Democracy   In 1990 the  National Party  government took the first step towards negotiating itself out of power when it lifted the ban on the  African National Congress  and other  left-wing  political organisations, and released  Nelson Mandela  from prison after twenty-seven years' incarceration on a  sabotage  sentence. Apartheid legislation was gradually removed from the statute books, and South Africa also destroyed its nuclear arsenal and acceded to the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . The first  multi-racial elections  were held in 1994, which the ANC won by an overwhelming majority. It has been in power ever since.   In  post-apartheid South Africa , millions of South Africans, mostly black, continued to live in  poverty , though poverty among whites, previously rare, has increased greatly. [ 16 ]  While some have partly attributed this to the legacy of the apartheid system, increasingly many attribute it to the failure of the current government to tackle social issues, coupled with the monetary and fiscal discipline of the current government to ensure both redistribution of wealth and economic growth. Since the ANC-led government took power, the  United Nations   Human Development Index  of South Africa has fallen, while it was steadily rising until the mid-1990s. [ 17 ]  Some of this could possibly be attributed to the  AIDS   pandemic  and the failure of the government to take steps to address it, [ 18 ] some of it can also be pinpointed to a government policy of  redistribution of wealth . As a mitigating factor, the social housing policy of the current government has produced an improvement in living conditions.     Politics       Main articles:  Politics of South Africa ,  Government of South Africa , and  Law of South Africa              The  Union Buildings  in  Pretoria  is the home of the South African executive.       South Africa has three capital cities:  Cape Town , the largest of the three, is the  legislative  capital;  Pretoria  is the  administrative  capital; and  Bloemfontein  is the  judicial  capital. South Africa has a  bicameral   parliament : the  National Council of Provinces  (the  upper house ) has 90 members, while the  National Assembly  (the  lower house ) has 400 members. Members of the lower house are elected on a population basis by  proportional representation : half of the members are elected from national lists and the other half are elected from provincial lists. Ten members are elected to represent each province in the National Council of Provinces, regardless of the population of the province. Elections for both chambers are held every five years. The government is formed in the lower house, and the leader of the majority party in the National Assembly is the  President .   The primary sources of South Africa law are Roman-Dutch mercantile law and personal law with English Common law, as imports of Dutch settlements and  British colonialism . [ 19 ]  The first European based law in South Africa was brought by the  Dutch East India Company  and is called  Roman-Dutch law . It was imported before the  codification  of European law into the  Napoleonic Code  and is comparable in many ways to  Scots law . This was followed in the 19th century by  English law , both  common  and  statutory . Starting in 1910 with unification, South Africa had its own  parliament  which passed laws specific for South Africa, building on those previously passed for the individual member colonies.   Current South African politics are dominated by the  African National Congress  (ANC), which received 69.7% of the vote during the last  2004 general election  and 66.3% of the vote in the  2006 municipal election . The current  President of South Africa  is  Kgalema Motlanthe , who replaced  Thabo Mbeki  on 25 September 2008. Mbeki succeeded former President  Nelson Mandela  in 1999, and was re-elected for a second five year term in 2004, but announced his resignation on 20 September 2008.   The main challenger to the rule of the ANC is the  Democratic Alliance  party, which received 12.4% of the vote in the 2004 election and 14.8% in the 2006 election.  Helen Zille , (elected 6 May 2007), is the party leader; the previous leader was  Tony Leon . The formerly dominant  New National Party , which introduced apartheid through its predecessor, the  National Party , chose to merge with the ANC on 9 April 2005. Other major political parties represented in Parliament are the  Inkatha Freedom Party , which mainly represents  Zulu  voters, and the  Independent Democrats , who took 6.97% and 1.7% of the vote respectively, in the 2004 election.   Since 2004, the country has had many thousands of popular protests, some violent, making it, according to one academic, the ""most protest-rich country in the world"". [ 20 ]  Many of these protests have been organised from the growing  shanty towns  that surround South African cities.     Foreign relations and military       Main articles:  South African National Defence Force ,  Foreign relations of South Africa , and  South Africa and weapons of mass destruction       Since the end of apartheid, the South African foreign policy has focused on its African partners particularly in the  Southern African Development Community  (SADC) and the  African Union . South Africa has played a key role as a mediator in African conflicts over the last decade, such as in  Burundi , the  Democratic Republic of Congo , the  Comoros , and  Zimbabwe . After apartheid ended, South Africa was readmitted to the  Commonwealth of Nations . As the  Union of South Africa , South Africa was a founding member of the  United Nations  and the then Prime Minister  Jan Smuts  wrote the preamble to its constitution. South Africa is currently a non-permanent member of the  United Nations Security Council  and has attracted controversy by voting against a resolution criticising the  Burmese  government in 2006 and against the implementation of sanctions against  Zimbabwe  in 2008. South Africa is a member of the  Group of 77  and chaired the organisation in 2006. South Africa is a member of the  South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone ,  Southern African Customs Union ,  World Trade Organization ,  International Monetary Fund ,  G20  and  G8+5 .   The South African  armed forces , known as the  South African National Defence Force  (SANDF), was created in 1994. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  Previously known as the  South African Defence Force  (SADF), the new force is an all volunteer army and consists of the forces of the old SADF, as well as the forces of the African nationalist groups, namely  Umkhonto we Sizwe  (MK),  Azanian People's Liberation Army  (APLA), and the former  Bantustan  defence forces. [ 21 ]  The SANDF is subdivided into four branches, the  South African Army , the  South African Air Force , the  South African Navy , and the  South African Military Health Services . [ 23 ]   In recent years, the SANDF has become a major  peacekeeping  force in Africa, [ 24 ]  and has been involved in operations in  Lesotho , the  Democratic Republic of the Congo , [ 24 ]  and  Burundi , [ 24 ]  amongst others. It has also participated as a part of multi-national  UN  peacekeeping forces.   South Africa undertook a nuclear weapons programme in the 1970s [ 25 ]  and  may have conducted  a nuclear test over the  Atlantic  in 1979. [ 26 ]  It is the only African country to have successfully  developed nuclear weapons . It has become the first country (followed by Ukraine) with nuclear capability to voluntarily renounce and dismantle its programme and in the process signed the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty  in 1991.

To this end, it abolished the four former provinces of South Africa ( Cape Province ,  Natal ,  Orange Free State , and  Transvaal ) and replaced them with nine fully integrated provinces. The new provinces are usually much smaller than the former provinces, which theoretically gives local governments more resources to distribute over smaller areas.   The nine provinces are further subdivided into  52 districts :  6 metropolitan  and  46 district municipalities . The 46 district municipalities are further subdivided into  231 local municipalities . The district municipalities also contain 20 district management areas (mostly game parks) that are directly governed by the district municipalities. The six metropolitan municipalities perform the functions of both district and local municipalities.

At 470,979  sq mi  (1,219,912 km), [ 27 ]  South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world (after  Mali ). It is comparable in size to  Colombia .  Njesuthi  in the  Drakensberg  at 3,408 m (11,424 ft) is the highest peak in South Africa.          View of the  Drakensberg mountains , the highest mountain range in South Africa.       South Africa has a generally  temperate climate , due in part to it being surrounded by the  Atlantic  and  Indian Oceans  on three sides, by its location in the climatically milder  southern hemisphere  and due to the average elevation rising steadily towards the north (towards the  equator ) and further inland. Due to this varied topography and oceanic influence, a great variety of climatic zones exist.   The climatic zones vary, from the extreme  desert  of the southern  Namib  in the farthest northwest to the lush  subtropical  climate in the east along the  Mozambique  border and the  Indian  ocean. From the east, the land quickly rises over a  mountainous   escarpment  towards the interior  plateau  known as the  Highveld . Even though South Africa is classified as  semi-arid , there is considerable variation in  climate  as well as  topography .   The interior of South Africa is a vast, rather flat, and sparsely populated  scrubland ,  Karoo , which is drier towards the northwest along the Namib desert. In contrast, the eastern coastline is lush and well-watered, which produces a climate similar to the tropics. The extreme southwest has a climate remarkably similar to that of the  Mediterranean  with wet winters and hot, dry summers, hosting the famous  Fynbos   Biome . This area also produces much of the  wine  in South Africa. This region is also particularly known for its wind, which blows intermittently almost all year. The severity of this wind made passing around the  Cape of Good Hope  particularly treacherous for sailors, causing many  shipwrecks . Further east on the south coast, rainfall is distributed more evenly throughout the year, producing a green landscape. This area is popularly known as the  Garden Route .          Satellite picture of South Africa       The  Free State  is particularly flat due to the fact that it lies centrally on the high plateau. North of the  Vaal River , the Highveld becomes better watered and does not experience subtropical extremes of heat.  Johannesburg , in the centre of the Highveld, is at 1,740 metres (5,709 ft) and receives an annual rainfall of 760 millimetres (30  in ). Winters in this region are cold, although  snow  is rare.   To the north of Johannesburg, the altitude drops beyond the escarpment of the Highveld, and turns into the lower lying Bushveld, an area of mixed dry forest and an abundance of wildlife. East of the Highveld, beyond the eastern escarpment, the Lowveld stretches towards the  Indian  ocean. It has particularly high temperatures, and is also the location of extended subtropical agriculture.   The high  Drakensberg mountains , which form the south-eastern escarpment of the Highveld, offer limited  skiing  opportunities in winter. The coldest place in South Africa is  Sutherland  in the western  Roggeveld Mountains , where midwinter temperatures can reach as low as 15 degrees  Celsius  (5  F ). The deep interior has the hottest temperatures: A temperature of 51.7 C (125 F) was recorded in 1948 in the  Northern Cape  Kalahari near  Upington . [ 28 ]   South Africa also has one possession, the small sub-Antarctic archipelago of the  Prince Edward Islands , consisting of  Marion Island  (290 km/112 sq mi) and Prince Edward Island (45 km/17.3 sq mi) (not to be confused with the  Canadian province of the same name ).           Weather averages for Cape Town, South Africa         Month   Jan   Feb   Mar   Apr   May   Jun   Jul   Aug   Sep   Oct   Nov   Dec   Year       Average high C (F)   27  (81)   28  (82)   26  (79)   24  (75)   20  (68)   18  (64)   17  (63)   18  (64)   19  (66)   22  (72)   24  (75)   26  (79)   28  (82)       Average low C (F)   16  (61)   16  (61)   15  (59)   13  (55)   10  (50)   8  (46)   8  (46)   8  (46)   9  (48)   11  (52)   14  (57)   15  (59)   8  (46)       Precipitation  mm (inches)   16.5  (0.65)   13  (0.51)   20  (0.79)   54  (2.13)   92  (3.62)   111  (4.37)   96  (3.78)   87  (3.43)   56  (2.2)   40  (1.57)   24  (0.94)   18  (0.71)   627  (24.69)       Source: EuroWEATHER [ 29 ]  2008-02-22         Flora and fauna     See also:  Wildlife of South Africa   See also:  Protected areas of South Africa             Fynbos , a  floral kingdom  unique to South Africa, is found near  Cape Town               Swartberg  mountains near the town of  Oudtshoorn              A field of flowers in Weskus National Park.       South Africa is one of only 17 countries worldwide considered  megadiverse . It has more than 20,000 different  plants , or about 10% of all the known  species  of plants on  Earth , making it particularly rich in plant biodiversity. South Africa is the 6th most biodiverse country, [ 30 ]  after  Brazil ,  Colombia ,  Indonesia ,  China , and  Mexico . The most prevalent biome in South Africa is the  grassland , particularly on the  Highveld , where the plant cover is dominated by different  grasses , low  shrubs , and  acacia trees , mainly camel-thorn and whitethorn.  Vegetation  becomes even more sparse towards the northwest due to low  rainfall . There are several species of water-storing  succulents  like  aloes  and euphorbias in the very hot and dry  Namaqualand  area. The grass and thorn  savannah  turns slowly into a bush savannah towards the north-east of the country, with denser growth. There are significant numbers of  baobab  trees in this area, near the northern end of  Kruger National Park . [ 31 ]   The  Fynbos   Biome , which makes up the majority of the area and plant life in the  Cape floristic region , one of the six  floral kingdoms , is located in a small region of the  Western Cape  and contains more than 9,000 of those species, making it among the richest regions on earth in terms of floral biodiversity. The majority of the plants are  evergreen  hard-leaf plants with fine, needle-like  leaves , such as the  sclerophyllous  plants. Another uniquely South African plant is the  protea  genus of flowering plants. There are around 130 different species of protea in South Africa.   While South Africa has a great wealth of flowering plants, it has few  forests . Only 1% of South Africa is forest, almost exclusively in the  humid   coastal plain  along the  Indian Ocean  in  KwaZulu-Natal  (see  KwaZulu-Cape coastal forest mosaic ). There are even smaller reserves of forests that are out of the reach of  fire , known as montane forests (see  Knysna-Amatole montane forests ).  Plantations  of imported tree species are predominant, particularly the non-native  eucalyptus  and  pine . South Africa has lost a large area of natural habitat in the last four decades, primarily due to  overpopulation , sprawling development patterns and  deforestation  during the nineteenth century. South Africa is one of the worst affected countries in the world when it comes to invasion by alien species with many (e.g.  Black Wattle ,  Port Jackson ,  Hakea ,  Lantana  and  Jacaranda ) posing a significant threat to the native  biodiversity  and the already scarce water resources. The original  temperate forest  that met the first European settlers to South Africa was exploited ruthlessly until only small patches remained. Currently, South African  hardwood  trees like  Real Yellowwood   (Podocarpus latifolius) ,  stinkwood   (Ocotea bullata) , and South African  Black Ironwood   (Olea laurifolia)  are under government protection.   Numerous  mammals  are found in the  bushveld  habitats including  lions ,  leopards ,  white rhinos ,  blue wildebeest ,  kudus ,  impalas ,  hyenas ,  hippopotamus  and  giraffes . A significant extent of the bushveld habitat exists in the north-east including  Kruger National Park  and the  Mala Mala  Reserve, as well as in the far north in the  Waterberg Biosphere .   Climate change is expected to bring considerable warming and drying to much of this already semi-arid region, with greater frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, flooding and drought. According to computer generated climate modelling produced by the South African National Biodiversity Institute [ 32 ]  parts of southern Africa will see an increase in temperature by about one degree Celsius along the coast to more than four degrees Celsius in the already hot hinterland such as the  Northern Cape  in late spring and summertime by 2050.   The Cape Floral Kingdom has been identified as one of the global  biodiversity hotspots  since it will be hit very hard by  climate change  and has such a great diversity of life. Drought, increased intensity and frequency of fire and climbing temperatures are expected to push many of these  rare species  towards  extinction .   South Africa houses many endemic species, among them the  critically endangered   Riverine Rabbit  ( Bunolagus monticullaris ) in the  Karoo .     Economy       Main article:  Economy of South Africa              The  Victoria & Alfred Waterfront  in  Cape Town  with  Table Mountain  in the background. Cape Town has become an important  retail  and  tourism  centre for the country, and attracts the largest number of foreign visitors in South Africa       By  UN  classification South Africa is a middle-income country with an abundant supply of resources, well-developed financial, legal, communications, energy, and transport sectors, a  stock exchange  (the  JSE Limited ), that ranks among the top twenty in the world, and a modern infrastructure supporting an efficient distribution of goods to major urban centres throughout the entire region. South Africa is ranked 25th in the world in terms of  GDP  (PPP) as of 2007.   Advanced development is significantly localised around four areas: Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Durban, and Pretoria/Johannesburg. Beyond these four economic centres, development is marginal and poverty is still prevalent despite government efforts. Consequently the vast majority of South Africans are poor. However, key marginal areas have experienced rapid growth recently. Such areas include Mossel Bay to Plettenberg Bay; Rustenburg area; Nelspruit area; Bloemfontein; Cape West Coast; and the KwaZulu-Natal North Coast.   Even though South Africa has the seventh highest per capita income in Africa, only behind  Libya ,  Mauritius  it suffers from large income gaps and a  dual economy  marking it as a  developing country . South Africa has one of the highest rates of  income inequality  in the world. A decade of continual economic growth has helped to lower unemployment, but daunting economic and social problems remain. The average South African household income decreased considerably between 1995 and 2000. As for racial inequality,  Statistics South Africa  reported that in 1995 the average white household earned four times as much as the average black household. In 2000 the average white household was earning six times more than the average black household. [ 33 ]  The  affirmative action  policies have seen a rise in black economic wealth and an emerging black middle class. [ 34 ]  Other problems are crime, corruption, and  HIV / AIDS .   At the start of 2000, then President Thabo Mbeki vowed to promote economic growth and foreign investment by relaxing restrictive labour laws, stepping up the pace of  privatisation , and cutting unneeded governmental spending. His policies face strong opposition from organised  labour . South Africa is also the largest energy producer and consumer on the continent. South Africa is a popular tourist destination, and a substantial amount of revenue comes from tourism. [ 35 ]  Among the main attractions are the diverse and picturesque culture, the game reserves and the highly regarded local wines.   The South African  rand  (ZAR), is the most actively traded emerging  market currency  in the world. It has joined an elite club of fifteen currencies, the  Continuous linked settlement  (CLS), where forex transactions are settled immediately, lowering the risks of transacting across  time zones . The rand was the best-performing currency against the  United States dollar  (USD) between 2002 and 2005, according to the  Bloomberg  Currency Scorecard.   The volatility of the  rand  has affected economic activity, falling sharply during 2001 and hitting a historic low of 13.85  ZAR  to the  USD , raising fears of inflation, and causing the Reserve Bank to increase  interest rates . The rand has since recovered, trading at 7.13 ZAR to the dollar as of January 2008. However, as exporters are put under considerable pressure from a stronger domestic currency, many call for government intervention to help soften the rand.   Refugees from poorer neighbouring countries include many immigrants from the DRC, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Malawi and others, representing a large portion of the informal sector. With high unemployment levels amongst poorer South Africans,  xenophobia  is prevalent and many people born in South Africa feel resentful of immigrants who are seen to be depriving the native population of jobs, a feeling which has been given credibility by the fact that many South African employers have employed migrants from other countries for lower pay than South African citizens, especially in the  construction ,  tourism ,  agriculture  and  domestic service  industries. Illegal immigrants are also heavily involved in informal trading. [ 36 ]  However, many immigrants to South Africa continue to live in poor conditions, and the South African immigration policy has become increasingly restrictive since 1994. [ 37 ]   Principal international trading partners of South Africa  besides other African countries  include  Germany ,  Japan ,  Switzerland , the  United Kingdom , and the  United States . Chief exports include  corn ,  diamonds ,  fruits ,  gold ,  metals  and  minerals ,  sugar , and  wool .  Machinery  and transportation equipment make up more than one-third of the value of the countrys imports. Other imports include  chemicals , manufactured goods, and  petroleum .     Electricity crisis   After unsuccessful attempts by the government to encourage private construction of electricity generation capacity, in 2007 the state-owned electricity supplier ( Eskom ) started experiencing a lack of capacity in the electrical generating and reticulation infrastructure. This led to an inability to meet the routine demands of industry and consumers, resulting in countrywide  rolling blackouts . Initially the lack of capacity was triggered by a failure at  Koeberg nuclear power station , but since then a general lack of capacity became evident. The supplier has been widely criticised for failing to adequately plan for and construct sufficient electrical generating capacity, [ 38 ]  although ultimately the government has admitted that it is at fault for refusing to approve funding for investment in infrastructure. [ 39 ]     Agriculture          Workers planting on a farm in the central area of  Mpumalanga .               Farm  workers.       South Africa has a large agricultural sector and is a net exporter of  farming  products. There are almost a thousand  agricultural cooperatives  and  agribusinesses  throughout the country, and agricultural exports have constituted 8% of South African total exports for the past five years. The agricultural industry contributes around 10% of formal employment, relatively low compared to other parts of Africa, as well as providing work for casual labourers and contributing around 2.6% of  GDP  for the nation. [ 40 ]  However, due to the  aridity  of the land, only 13.5% can be used for crop production, and only 3% is considered high potential land. [ 41 ]   Although the commercial farming sector is relatively well developed, people in some rural areas still survive on  subsistence agriculture . It is the eighth largest wine producer in the world, and the eleventh largest producer of sunflower seed. South Africa is a net exporter of agricultural products and foodstuffs, the largest number of exported items being  sugar ,  grapes ,  citrus ,  nectarines ,  wine  and  deciduous  fruit. The largest locally produced crop is  maize  (corn), and it has been estimated that 9 million tons are produced every year, with 7.4 million tons being consumed.  Livestock  are also popular on South African farms, with the country producing 85% of all meat consumed. The dairy industry consists of around 4,300 milk producers providing employment for 60,000 farm workers and contributing to the livelihoods of around 40,000 others. [ 42 ]   In recent years, the agricultural sector has introduced several reforms, some of which are controversial, such as  land reform  and the deregulation of the market for agricultural products. Land reform has been criticised both by farmers' groups and by landless workers, the latter alleging that the pace of change has not been fast enough, and the former alleging racist treatment and expressing concerns that a similar situation to  Zimbabwe's land reform policy  may develop, [ 43 ]  a fear exacerbated by comments made by  deputy president , the deputy president of South Africa. [ 44 ] [ 45 ]  The sector continues to face problems, with increased foreign competition and crime being two of the major challenges for the industry. The government has been accused of either putting in too much effort [ 46 ] , or not enough effort [ 47 ] , to tackle the problem of  farm attacks  as opposed to other forms of violent crime.   Another issue which affects South African agriculture is environmental damage caused by misuse of the land and global climate change. South Africa is unusually vulnerable to climate change and resultant diminution of surface waters. Some predictions show surface water supply could decrease by 60% by the year 2070 in parts of the Western Cape. [ 48 ]  To reverse the damage caused by land mismanagement, the government has supported a scheme which promotes  sustainable development  and the use of natural resources. [ 49 ]  Maize production, which contributes to a 36% majority of the gross value of South Africas field crops, has also experienced negative effects due to climate change. The estimated value of loss, which takes into consideration scenarios with and without the carbon dioxide fertilization effect [2]  ,ranges between 10s to 100s of millions of Rands.

South Africa is a nation of more than 48 million people of diverse origins,  cultures ,  languages , and  religions . The last  census  was held in 2001 and the next will be in 2011.  Statistics South Africa  provided five  racial  categories by which people could classify themselves, the last of which, ""unspecified/other"" drew negligible responses, and these results were omitted. [ 51 ]  The 2006 midyear estimated figures for the other categories were  Black African  at 79.5%,  White  at 9.2%,  Coloured  at 8.9%, and  Indian or Asian  at 2.5%. [ 52 ]  Even though the population of South Africa has increased in the past decade [ 51 ] [ 53 ]  (primarily due to immigration), the country had an annual population growth rate of 0.501% in 2008 (CIA est.), including immigration. [ 54 ]  South Africa is home to an estimated 5 million  illegal immigrants , including some 3 million  Zimbabweans . [ 55 ] [ 56 ] [ 57 ]  A series of  anti-immigrant riots  occurred in South Africa beginning on 11 May 2008. [ 58 ] [ 59 ]   By far the major part of the population classified itself as African or black, but it is not culturally or linguistically homogeneous. Major ethnic groups include the  Zulu ,  Xhosa ,  Basotho  (South Sotho),  Bapedi  (North Sotho),  Venda ,  Tswana ,  Tsonga ,  Swazi  and  Ndebele , all of which speak  Bantu languages  (see  Bantu peoples of South Africa ).   Some, such as the Zulu, Xhosa, Bapedi and Venda groups, are unique to South Africa. Other groups are distributed across the borders with neighbours of South Africa: The  Basotho  group is also the major ethnic group in  Lesotho . The  Tswana  ethnic group constitute the majority of the population of  Botswana . The  Swazi  ethnic group is the major ethnic group in  Swaziland . The  Ndebele  ethnic group is also found in  Matabeleland  in  Zimbabwe , where they are known as the  Matabele . These Ndebele people are the descendants of a Zulu faction under the warrior  Mzilikazi  that escaped persecution from  Shaka  by migrating to their current territory. The  Tsonga  ethnic group is also found in southern  Mozambique , where they are known as the Shangaan.   The white population is not ethnically homogenous and descend from many ethnic groups:  Dutch ,  Flemish ,  Portuguese , German, French  Huguenot , English, Irish, Italian, Scottish and  Welsh . Culturally and linguistically, they are divided into the  Afrikaners , who speak  Afrikaans , and English-speaking groups, many of whom are descended from British and Irish immigrants (see  Anglo-African ). Many small communities that have immigrated over the last century retain the use of other languages. The  white population  is on the decrease due to a low birth rate and emigration; as a factor in their decision to emigrate, many cite the high  crime  rate and the  affirmative action  policies of the government. Since 1994, approximately 1 000 000 white South Africans have permanently emigrated. [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ] [ 63 ]  Despite high emigration levels, a high level of non-South African white immigrants have settled in the country, in particular from countries such as  Britain  and  Zimbabwe . For example, by 2005, an estimated 212 000 British citizens were residing in South Africa. Since 2003, the numbers of British migrants coming to South Africa has risen by 50%. An estimated 20 000 British migrants moved to South Africa in 2007. There have also been a significant number of  white Zimbabwean  arrivals, fleeing their home country in light of the economic and political problems currently facing the country. As well as recent arrivals, a significant number of white Zimbabweans emigrated to South Africa in the wake of independence in Zimbabwe in 1980. Some of the more nostalgic members of the community are known in popular culture as "" Whenwes "", because of their nostalgia for their lives in  Rhodesia  ""when we were in Rhodesia"". [ 64 ]   The term  Coloured  is still largely used for the people of mixed race descended from slaves brought in from East and Central Africa, the indigenous  Khoisan  who lived in the  Cape  at the time, Bantus, Whites (mostly the  Dutch / Afrikaner  and British settlers) as well as an admixture of  Javanese ,  Malay , Indian,  Malagasy  and Asian blood (such as  Burmese ). The majority speak Afrikaans. Khoisan is a term used to describe two separate groups, physically similar: light-skinned and small in stature. The  Khoikhoi , who were called  Hottentots  by the Europeans, were pastoralists and were annihilated; the San, called  Bushmen  by the Europeans, were hunter-gatherers. Within the Coloured community, more recent immigrants will also be found: Coloureds from the former  Rhodesia  (now  Zimbabwe );  Namibia  and immigrants of mixed descent from India and  Burma  ( Anglo-Indians / Anglo-Burmese ) who were welcomed to the Cape when India and Burma received their Independence.   The major part of the South African  Asian  population is Indian in origin (see  Indian South Africans ); many of them descended from indentured workers brought in the nineteenth century to work on the  sugar   plantations  of the eastern coastal area then known as  Natal . There is also a significant group of  Chinese South Africans  (approximately 100,000 individuals) and  Vietnamese  South Africans (approximately 50,000 individuals). In 2008, the Pretoria High Court has ruled that Chinese South Africans who arrived before 1994 are to be reclassified as  Coloureds . As a result of this ruling, about 12,000 - 15,000  [ 65 ] ethnically Chinese citizens who arrived before 1994, numbering 3%-5% of the total Chinese population in the country, will be able to benefit from government  BEE  policies. [ 66 ]   South Africa hosts a sizeable refugee and asylum seeker population. According to the  World Refugee Survey 2008 , published by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, this population numbered approximately 144,700 in 2007. [ 67 ]  Groups of refugees and asylum seekers numbering over 10,000 included people from  Zimbabwe  (48,400), The  Democratic Republic of the Congo  (24,800), and  Somalia  (12,900). [ 67 ]  These populations mainly lived in Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban, Cape Town, and Port Elizabeth. [ 67 ]     Science and technology   Several important scientific and technological developments have originated in South Africa.  The first human to human heart transplant was performed by cardiac surgeon  Christiaan Barnard  at  Groote Schuur Hospital  in December 1967  .  Max Theiler  developed a vaccine against Yellow Fever,  Allan McLeod Cormack  pioneered x-ray  Computed tomography , and  Aaron Klug  developed crystallographic electron microscopy techniques. These advancements were all recognized with  Nobel Prizes .  Sydney Brenner  won most recently, in 2002, for his pioneering work in  molecular biology .   Mark Shuttleworth  founded an early Internet security company  Thawte , that was subsequently bought out by world-leader  VeriSign . Despite government efforts to encourage entrepreneurship in biotechnology, IT and other high technology fields, no other notable groundbreaking companies have been founded in South Africa. However, it is the expressed objective of the government to transition the economy to be more reliant on high technology, based on the realization that South African cannot compete with Far Eastern economies in manufacturing, nor can the republic rely on its mineral wealth in perpetuity.   South Africa has cultivated a burgeoning astronomy community. It hosts the  Southern African Large Telescope , the largest optical telescope in the southern hemisphere. South Africa is currently building the  Karoo Array Telescope  as a pathfinder for the $20 billion  Square Kilometer Array  project. South Africa is a finalist, with Australia, to be the host of the SKA.     Society and culture       Main article:  Culture of South Africa              Decorated houses,  Drakensberg Mountains              Traditional  South African cuisine .       It may be argued that there is no ""single"" culture in South Africa because of its ethnic diversity. Today, the diversity in foods from many cultures is enjoyed by all and especially marketed to tourists who wish to sample the large variety of South African cuisine. In addition to  food ,  music  and  dance  feature prominently.   South African cuisine  is heavily  meat-based  and has spawned the distinctively South African social gathering known as a  braai , or barbecue. South Africa has also developed into a major  wine  producer, with some of the best  vineyards  lying in valleys around  Stellenbosch ,  Franschoek ,  Paarl  and  Barrydale . [ 68 ]   There is great diversity in music from South Africa. Many black musicians who sang in Afrikaans or English during apartheid have since begun to sing in traditional African languages, and have developed a unique style called  Kwaito . Of note is  Brenda Fassie , who launched to fame with her song ""Weekend Special"", which was sung in English. More famous traditional musicians include  Ladysmith Black Mambazo , while the  Soweto String Quartet  performs classic music with an African flavour. White and Coloured South African singers are historically influenced by European musical styles including such western metal bands such as  Seether  (formerly Saron Gas). South Africa has produced world-famous jazz musicians, notably  Hugh Masekela ,  Jonas Gwangwa ,  Abdullah Ibrahim ,  Miriam Makeba ,  Jonathan Butler ,  Chris McGregor , and  Sathima Bea Benjamin .  Afrikaans  music covers multiple genres, such as the  contemporary   Steve Hofmeyr  and the  punk rock  band  Fokofpolisiekar . Crossover artists such as  Johnny Clegg  and his bands  Juluka  and  Savuka  have enjoyed various success underground, publicly, and abroad.   The South African black majority still has a substantial number of rural inhabitants who lead largely impoverished lives. It is among these people, however, that cultural traditions survive most strongly; as blacks have become increasingly  urbanised  and  westernised , aspects of traditional culture have declined. Urban blacks usually speak English or  Afrikaans  in addition to their native tongue. There are smaller but still significant groups of speakers of  Khoisan languages  who are not included in the eleven official languages, but are one of the eight other officially recognised languages. There are small groups of speakers of  endangered languages , most of which are from the Khoi-San family, that receive no official status; however, some groups within South Africa are attempting to promote their use and revival.   The  middle class  lifestyle, predominantly of the white minority but with growing numbers of Black, Coloured and Indian people, [ 69 ]  is similar in many respects to that of people found in  Western Europe , North America and  Australasia . Members of the middle class often study and work abroad for greater exposure to the markets of the world.   Asians , predominantly of Indian origin, preserve their own cultural heritage, languages and religious beliefs, being either  Christian ,  Hindu  or  Sunni Muslim  and speaking English, with Indian languages like  Hindi ,  Telugu ,  Tamil  or  Gujarati  being spoken less frequently, but the majority of Indians being able to understand their mother tongue. The first Indians arrived on the famous  Truro ship  as  indentured labourers  in Natal to work the Sugar Cane Fields. There is a much smaller  Chinese  community in South Africa, although its numbers have increased due to immigration from  Republic of China  (Taiwan).   South Africa has also had a large influence in the  Scouting  movement, with many Scouting traditions and ceremonies coming from the experiences of  Robert Baden-Powell  (the founder of Scouting) during his time in South Africa as a military officer in the 1890s. The  South African Scout Association  was one of the first youth organisations to open its doors to youth and adults of all races in South Africa. This happened on 2 July 1977 at a conference known as  Quo Vadis . [ 70 ]   The South African music scene consists of  Kwaito , a new music genre that had developed in the mid 80s and has since developed to become the most popular social economical form of representation among the populous. Though some may argue that the political aspects of Kwaito has since diminished after  Apartheid , and the relative interest in politics has become a minor aspect of daily life. Some argue that in a sense,  Kwaito  is in fact a political force that shows activism in its apolitical actions. Today, major corporations like  Sony ,  BMG , and  EMI  have appeared on the South African scene to produce and distribute  Kwaito  music. Due to its overwhelming popularity, as well as the general influence of DJs, who are among the top 5 most influential types of people within the country,  Kwaito  has taken over radio, television, and magazines. [ 71 ]   Kwaito , much like most hip-hop has its own local flavor and originality. However, unlike when hip-hop first burst on the scene as a politically driven and rebellious underground movement, South Africans wanted to create a happier vibe. As the post-apartheid fog cleared, South African youth found their ""own voice in a style of music known as kwaito, spawning a new (and profitable) industry"". [ 72 ]  According to TIMEeurope magazine, ""The kwaito sound now regularly incorporates traditional African music, jazz, gospel, and even rock guitar, most notably on Mandoza's 2000 hit Nkalakatha, one of the few kwaito records to cross over onto traditionally white radio"". [ 73 ]  In the kwaito, the samples from old school  Jamaican dancehall , European house, etc.,  tempos  are changed, beats are added, and urban street slang is also incorporated. This local flavor of music more recently has been attacked for its lack of ingenuity and its betrayal of its roots. The melodies and the incorporation of sex and dance have since become very similar to the American standard. In addition Kwaito has been criticised for its absence of influential lyrical content. As Kwaito is still a developing genre, and since the South African population is only around 48 million, sales of only 25,000 CDs are required for ""gold"" certification in South Africa. [ 72 ]     Religion       Main article:  Religion in South Africa               St. Mark 's Anglican Cathedral.       According to the latest 2001 national census, Christians accounted for 79.7% of the population. This includes  Zion Christian  11.1%,  Pentecostal  ( Charismatic ) 8.2%,  Roman Catholic  7.1%,  Methodist  6.8%,  Dutch Reformed  6.7%,  Anglican  3.8%, and other Christian 36%.  Islam  accounted for 1.5% of the population,  Hinduism  about 1.3%, and  Judaism  0.2%. 15.1% had no religious affiliation, 2.3% were other and 1.4% were unspecified. [ 74 ] [ 75 ]   African Indigenous Churches were the largest of the  Christian  groups. It was believed that many of these persons who claimed no affiliation with any organised religion adhered to  traditional indigenous religions . Many peoples have  syncretic  religious practices combining Christian and indigenous influences. [ 76 ]   Islam in South Africa  itself is not known to pre-date the colonial period, despite the isolated contact neighbouring  Mozambique  had with  Arab  and  East African  traders. [ citation needed ]  There is no evidence that Islam was known to the  Zulu ,  Swazi , or  Xhosa  of the east coast prior to the colonial era. Many South African Muslims are described as  Coloureds , notably in the  Western Cape , especially those whose ancestors came as slaves from the Indonesian archipelago (the  Cape Malays ). Others are described as  Indians , notably in  KwaZulu-Natal , including those whose ancestors came as traders from  South Asia ; they have been joined by others from other parts of Africa as well as white or black South African converts. It is estimated that  Islam  is the fastest growing religion of conversion in the country, [ 77 ]  with the number of black  Muslims  growing sixfold, from 12,000 in 1991 to 74,700 in 2004. [ 78 ]   Hinduism  dates back to British Colonial period primarily but later waves of continuous immigrants from India have contributed to a sizable Hindu population. Most Hindus are ethnically South Asian but there are many who come from mixed racial stock and many are converts with the efforts of Hindu missionaries such as ISKCON. Other religions in smaller numbers are  Sikhism ,  Jainism  and  Bah' Faith . [ 75 ]     Languages       Main article:  Languages of South Africa              Map showing principal South African languages by municipality. Lighter shades indicate a non-majority  plurality .             Afrikaans          Northern Sotho          Southern Sotho          Swati          Tsonga            Tswana          Venda          Xhosa          Zulu               South Africa has eleven  official languages : [ 79 ]   Sepedi ,  Sesotho ,  Setswana ,  siSwati ,  Tshivenda ,  Xitsonga ,  Afrikaans ,  English ,  isiNdebele ,  isiXhosa  and  isiZulu . In this regard it is  second only to India  in number. While each language is formally equal to every other, some languages are spoken more than others. According to the 2001 National Census, the three most spoken first home languages are Zulu (23.8%), Xhosa (17.6%) and Afrikaans (13.3%). [ 51 ]  Despite the fact that English is recognised as the language of commerce and science, it was spoken by only 8.2% of South Africans at home in 2001, an even lower percentage than in 1996 (8.6%). [ 51 ]   There are  eleven official names  for South Africa, one in each of the official national languages. The country also recognises eight non-official languages:  Fanagalo ,  Khoe ,  Lobedu ,  Nama ,  Northern Ndebele ,  Phuthi ,  San  and  South African Sign Language . [ citation needed ]  These non-official languages may be used in certain official uses in limited areas where it has been determined that these languages are prevalent. Nevertheless, their populations are not such that they require nationwide recognition.   Many of the ""unofficial languages"" of the  San  and  Khoikhoi  people contain regional  dialects  stretching northward into Namibia and Botswana, and elsewhere. These people, who are a physically distinct population from other Africans, have their own cultural identity based on their  hunter-gatherer  societies. They have been marginalised to a great extent, and many of their languages are in danger of becoming  extinct .   Many white South Africans also speak other European languages, such as  Portuguese  (also spoken by Angolan and Mozambican blacks), German, and  Greek , while some  Asians  and  Indians  in South Africa speak  South Asian  languages, such as  Tamil ,  Hindi ,  Gujarati ,  Urdu  and  Telugu .  French  is still widely spoken by French South Africans especially in places like  Franschhoek , where many South Africans are of French origin. South African French is spoken by less than 10,000 individuals. Congolese French is also spoken in South Africa by migrants.

Other sports with significant support are  swimming ,  golf  and  netball .  Basketball ,  surfing  and  skateboarding  are popular among the youth.   Famous boxing personalities include Baby Jake  Jacob Matlala ,  Vuyani Bungu ,  Welcome Ncita ,  Dingaan Thobela ,  Gerrie Coetzee  and  Brian Mitchell . Football players who have excelled in international clubs include  Lucas Radebe  of  Leeds United  and  Quinton Fortune , formerly of  Manchester United ,  Benni McCarthy  and  Aaron Mokoena  of  Blackburn Rovers  and  Steven Pienaar  of  Everton . South Africa produced  Formula 1  motor racing's 1979 world champion  Jody Scheckter .   South Africa hosted and won the  1995 Rugby World Cup  at their first attempt and again won the  2007 Rugby World Cup  in  France . South Africa was only allowed to participate from 1995 since the end of  Apartheid . It followed the 1995 Rugby World Cup by hosting and winning the  1996 African Cup of Nations  football tournament. It also hosted the  2003 Cricket World Cup  and the  2007 World Twenty20 Championship . South Africa will be the host nation for the  2010 FIFA World Cup , which will be the first time the tournament is held on the African continent.   In 2004, the swim team of  Roland Schoeman ,  Lyndon Ferns ,  Darian Townsend  and  Ryk Neethling  won the gold medal at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, simultaneously breaking the world record in the 4x100 freestyle relay.  Penny Heyns  won Olympic Gold in the 1996  Atlanta Olympic Games .   In golf,  Gary Player  is generally regarded as one of the greatest golfers of all time, having won the  Career Grand Slam , one of five golfers to have done so. Other South African golfers to have successfully won a major tournament include  Bobby Locke ,  Ernie Els ,  Retief Goosen  and  Trevor Immelman .     Current issues     HIV/AIDS       Main article:  HIV/AIDS in South Africa       The spread of  AIDS  (acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome) is an alarming problem in South Africa with up to 31% of pregnant women found to be HIV infected in 2005 and the infection rate among adults estimated at 20%. [ 80 ]  The link between HIV, a virus spread primarily by sexual contact, and AIDS was long denied by prior president  Thabo Mbeki  and then health minister  Manto Tshabalala-Msimang , who insisted that the many deaths in the country are due to malnutrition, and hence poverty, and not HIV. [ 81 ]  In 2007, in response to international pressure, the government made efforts to fight AIDS. [ 82 ]  In September 2008 Thabo Mbeki was ousted by the ANC and  Kgalema Motlanthe  was appointed for the interim. One of Mr. Motlanthe's first actions was to replace Mrs. Tshabalala-Msimang with the current minister,  Barbara Hogan .   AIDS affects mainly those who are sexually active and is far more prevalent in the black population. Most deaths are people who are also economically active, resulting in many families losing their primary wage earners. This has resulted in many 'AIDS orphans' who in many cases depend on the state for care and financial support. [ 83 ]  It is estimated that there are 1,200,000 orphans in South Africa. [ 83 ]  Many elderly people also lose the support from lost younger members of their family. Roughly 5 million people are infected with the disease. [ 82 ]     Crime       Main article:  Crime in South Africa               Prison  buildings on  Robben Island       According to a survey for the period 19982000 compiled by the  United Nations , South Africa was ranked second for  murder  and first for  assaults  and  rapes  per capita. [ 84 ]  Total crime per capita is 10th out of the 60 countries in the data set.   Crime  has had a pronounced effect on society: many middle-class South Africans moved into  gated communities , abandoning the central business districts of some cities for the relative security of suburbs. This effect is most pronounced in  Johannesburg , although the trend is noticeable in other cities as well. [ citation needed ]  Many emigrants from South Africa also state that crime was a big motivator for them to leave.  Crime against the farming community  has continued to be a major problem. [ 85 ]     Skills migration   Along with many African nations, South Africa has been experiencing a "" brain drain "" in the past 20 years. This is believed to be potentially damaging for the regional economy, [ 86 ]  and is almost certainly detrimental for the well-being of the majority of people reliant on the healthcare infrastructure, given the HIV/AIDS epidemic. [ 87 ]  The skills drain in South Africa tends to demonstrate racial contours (naturally given the skills distribution legacy of South Africa) and has thus resulted in large white South African communities abroad. [ 88 ]     Xenophobia       Main article:  Xenophobia in South Africa       In May 2008 long standing state hostility to African migrants exploded in a series of pogroms that left up to 100 people dead and 100,000 displaced.

The South African coast stretches 2,798 kilometres (1,739 mi) [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  and borders both the  Atlantic  and  Indian   oceans . [ 7 ]  To the north of South Africa lie  Namibia ,  Botswana ,  Zimbabwe ,  Mozambique  and  Swaziland , while the  Kingdom of Lesotho  is an independent  enclave  surrounded by South African territory. [ 8 ]   Modern human beings have inhabited South Africa for more than 100,000 years. [ 9 ]  A century and a half after the discovery of the  Cape Sea Route , the  Dutch East India Company   founded  a refreshment station at what would become  Cape Town  in 1652. [ 10 ]  Cape Town became a British colony in 1806. European settlement expanded during the 1820s as the  Boers  (original  Dutch ,  Flemish ,  German  and  French  settlers) and the British  1820 Settlers  claimed land in the north and east of the country. Conflicts arose among the Xhosa, Zulu and Afrikaner groups. However, the discovery of diamonds and later gold triggered the conflict known as the  Anglo-Boer War  as the Boers and the British fought for the control of the South African mineral wealth. Although the Boers were defeated, limited independence was given to South Africa in 1910 as a British dominion. Anti-British policies focused on ultimate independence which was achieved in 1961 when South Africa was declared a  republic . The leading  National Party  legislated for a continuation of racial segregation begun under Dutch and British colonial rule, Boer republics, and subsequent South African governments (and which in 1948 became legally institutionalized  segregation  known as  apartheid ), despite opposition both in and outside of the country. In 1990 the then president  F.W. de Klerk  began to dismantle this legislation, and in 1994 the first democratic election was held in South Africa. This election brought  Nelson Mandela  and the current ruling party, the  African National Congress  to power, and the country rejoined the  Commonwealth of Nations .   South Africa is known for its diversity in cultures, languages, and religious beliefs, and eleven official languages are recognised in its  constitution . [ 7 ]  English is the most commonly spoken language in official and commercial public life, however it is only the fifth most spoken home language. [ 7 ]  South Africa is ethnically diverse, with the largest  Caucasian ,  Indian , and  racially mixed  communities in Africa. Although 79.6% of the South African population is  Black , [ 2 ]  this category is neither culturally nor linguistically homogenous, as people within this classification speak a number of different  Bantu languages , nine of which have official status. [ 7 ]  Midyear 2007, the South African population was estimated at 47.9 million.

(September 2008)           Main article:  History of South Africa       South Africa contains some of the oldest archaeological sites in the world. [ 11 ]   [ 12 ]  Extensive fossil remains at the  Sterkfontein ,  Kromdraai  and Makapansgat caves suggest that various  australopithecines  existed in South Africa from about three million years ago. [ 13 ]  These were succeeded by various species of  Homo , including  Homo habilis ,  Homo erectus  and modern humans,  Homo sapiens . Settlements of  Bantu -speaking peoples, who were  iron -using agriculturists and herdsmen, were already present south of the  Limpopo River  by the fourth or fifth century (see  Bantu expansion ) displacing and absorbing the original  KhoiSan  speakers. They slowly moved south and the earliest ironworks in modern-day  KwaZulu-Natal Province  are believed to date from around 1050. The southernmost group was the  Xhosa  people, whose language incorporates certain linguistic traits from the earlier KhoiSan people, reaching the  Fish River , in today's  Eastern Cape Province . These  Iron Age  populations displaced earlier people, who often had  hunter-gatherer  societies, as they migrated.     European colonisation          Painting of an account of the arrival of  Jan van Riebeeck , the first  European  to settle in South Africa, with  Devil's Peak  in the background       In 1487, the  Portuguese  explorer  Bartolomeu Dias  became the first European to reach the southernmost point of Africa. Initially named The Cape of Storms, The King of Portugal,  John II , renamed it the  Cabo da Boa Esperana  or  Cape of Good Hope  as it led to the riches of India. This great feat of navigation was later immortalized in  Cames ' epic Portuguese poem,  The Lusiads  (1572). In 1652, a refreshment station was established at the  Cape of Good Hope  by  Jan van Riebeeck  on behalf of the  Dutch East India Company .  Slaves  were brought from  Indonesia ,  Madagascar , and India as a labour source for the Dutch immigrants in  Cape Town . As they expanded east, the Dutch settlers eventually met the south-westerly expanding  Xhosa  people in the region of the  Fish River . A series of wars, called the  Cape Frontier Wars , ensued, mainly caused by conflicting land and livestock interests.   Great Britain  took over the  Cape of Good Hope  area in 1795 ostensibly to stop it falling into the hands of the Revolutionary French, but also seeking to use  Cape Town  in particular as a stop on the route to Australia and India. It was later returned to the Dutch in 1803, but soon afterwards the  Dutch East India Company  declared bankruptcy, and the British annexed the Cape Colony in 1806. The British continued the frontier wars against the Xhosa, pushing the eastern frontier eastward through a line of forts established along the Fish River and consolidating it by encouraging  British settlement . Due to pressure of  abolitionist  societies in Britain, the  British parliament  first stopped its global  slave trade  with the passage of the  Slave Trade Act 1807 , then abolished slavery in all its colonies with the  Slavery Abolition Act 1833 . During the 1830s, approximately 12 000  Boers  (later known as  Voortrekkers ), departed from the  Cape Colony , where they were subjected to British control, to the future Natal, Orange Free State and Transvaal regions. The Boers founded the  Boer Republics  - the  South African Republic  (Now  Gauteng ,  Limpopo ,  Mpumalanga  and  North West  provinces) and the  Orange Free State  ( Free State ).   The discovery of  diamonds  in 1867 and  gold  in 1884 in the interior encouraged economic growth and immigration, intensifying the subjugation of the indigenous people. These important economic resources did not only play a role between European and the indigenous population but also between the Boers and the British. [ 14 ]   The  Boer Republics  successfully resisted British encroachments during the  First Boer War  (18801881) using  guerrilla warfare  tactics, much better suited to local conditions. However, the British returned in greater numbers, more experience, and more suitable tactics in the  Second Boer War  (18991902). The Boers' attempt to ally themselves with  German South-West Africa  provided the British with yet another excuse to take control of the Boer Republics. [ citation needed ]           Boers  in combat (1881).         Independence   After four years of negotiating, the  Union of South Africa  was created from the  Cape  and  Natal  colonies, as well as the republics of  Orange Free State  and  Transvaal , on 31 May 1910, exactly eight years after the end of the Second Boer War. The newly created Union of South Africa was a  dominion . The  Natives' Land Act  of 1913 severely restricted the ownership of land by 'blacks', at that stage to a mere 7% of the country, although this amount was eventually increased marginally. [ 15 ]  The union was effectively granted independence from the United Kingdom with the passage of the  Statute of Westminster , which morphed the  British king's  position within South Africa into that of the distinct  King of South Africa . In 1934, the  South African Party  and  National Party  merged to form the  United Party , seeking reconciliation between Afrikaners and English-speaking ""Whites"", but split in 1939 over the entry of the Union into  World War II  as an ally of the United Kingdom, a move which the National Party strongly opposed.   In 1948, the  National Party  was elected to power, and intensified the implementation of racial segregation that had begun under Dutch and British colonial rule, and subsequent South African governments since the Union was formed. The Nationalist Government systematised existing segregationist laws, and the system of segregation became known collectively as  apartheid . Not surprisingly, this segregation also applied to the wealth acquired during rapid industrialisation of the 1950s, '60s, and '70s. While the White minority enjoyed the highest  standard of living  in all of Africa, often comparable to  First World  western nations, the Black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard, including income, education, housing, and life expectancy. On 31 May 1961, following a whites-only  referendum , the country became a  republic  and left the (British)  Commonwealth . The office of  Governor-General  was abolished and replaced with the position of  State President .   Apartheid became increasingly controversial, leading to widespread  sanctions ,  divestment  and growing unrest and oppression within South Africa. (See also the article on the  History of South Africa in the apartheid era .) A long period of harsh suppression by the government, and at times violent resistance,  strikes , marches, protests, and  sabotage  by bombing and other means, by various anti-apartheid movements, most notably the  African National Congress  (ANC), followed. In the late 1970s, South Africa began a programme of  nuclear weapons  development and in the following decade it produced six deliverable nuclear weapons. The rationale for the nuclear arsenal is disputed, but it is believed [ who? ]  that  Vorster  and  P.W. Botha  wanted to be able to catalyse American intervention in the event of a war between South Africa and the  Cuban -supported  MPLA  government of  Angola .     Democracy   In 1990 the  National Party  government took the first step towards negotiating itself out of power when it lifted the ban on the  African National Congress  and other  left-wing  political organisations, and released  Nelson Mandela  from prison after twenty-seven years' incarceration on a  sabotage  sentence. Apartheid legislation was gradually removed from the statute books, and South Africa also destroyed its nuclear arsenal and acceded to the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . The first  multi-racial elections  were held in 1994, which the ANC won by an overwhelming majority. It has been in power ever since.   In  post-apartheid South Africa , millions of South Africans, mostly black, continued to live in  poverty , though poverty among whites, previously rare, has increased greatly. [ 16 ]  While some have partly attributed this to the legacy of the apartheid system, increasingly many attribute it to the failure of the current government to tackle social issues, coupled with the monetary and fiscal discipline of the current government to ensure both redistribution of wealth and economic growth. Since the ANC-led government took power, the  United Nations   Human Development Index  of South Africa has fallen, while it was steadily rising until the mid-1990s. [ 17 ]  Some of this could possibly be attributed to the  AIDS   pandemic  and the failure of the government to take steps to address it, [ 18 ] some of it can also be pinpointed to a government policy of  redistribution of wealth . As a mitigating factor, the social housing policy of the current government has produced an improvement in living conditions.     Politics       Main articles:  Politics of South Africa ,  Government of South Africa , and  Law of South Africa              The  Union Buildings  in  Pretoria  is the home of the South African executive.       South Africa has three capital cities:  Cape Town , the largest of the three, is the  legislative  capital;  Pretoria  is the  administrative  capital; and  Bloemfontein  is the  judicial  capital. South Africa has a  bicameral   parliament : the  National Council of Provinces  (the  upper house ) has 90 members, while the  National Assembly  (the  lower house ) has 400 members. Members of the lower house are elected on a population basis by  proportional representation : half of the members are elected from national lists and the other half are elected from provincial lists. Ten members are elected to represent each province in the National Council of Provinces, regardless of the population of the province. Elections for both chambers are held every five years. The government is formed in the lower house, and the leader of the majority party in the National Assembly is the  President .   The primary sources of South Africa law are Roman-Dutch mercantile law and personal law with English Common law, as imports of Dutch settlements and  British colonialism . [ 19 ]  The first European based law in South Africa was brought by the  Dutch East India Company  and is called  Roman-Dutch law . It was imported before the  codification  of European law into the  Napoleonic Code  and is comparable in many ways to  Scots law . This was followed in the 19th century by  English law , both  common  and  statutory . Starting in 1910 with unification, South Africa had its own  parliament  which passed laws specific for South Africa, building on those previously passed for the individual member colonies.   Current South African politics are dominated by the  African National Congress  (ANC), which received 69.7% of the vote during the last  2004 general election  and 66.3% of the vote in the  2006 municipal election . The current  President of South Africa  is  Kgalema Motlanthe , who replaced  Thabo Mbeki  on 25 September 2008. Mbeki succeeded former President  Nelson Mandela  in 1999, and was re-elected for a second five year term in 2004, but announced his resignation on 20 September 2008.   The main challenger to the rule of the ANC is the  Democratic Alliance  party, which received 12.4% of the vote in the 2004 election and 14.8% in the 2006 election.  Helen Zille , (elected 6 May 2007), is the party leader; the previous leader was  Tony Leon . The formerly dominant  New National Party , which introduced apartheid through its predecessor, the  National Party , chose to merge with the ANC on 9 April 2005. Other major political parties represented in Parliament are the  Inkatha Freedom Party , which mainly represents  Zulu  voters, and the  Independent Democrats , who took 6.97% and 1.7% of the vote respectively, in the 2004 election.   Since 2004, the country has had many thousands of popular protests, some violent, making it, according to one academic, the ""most protest-rich country in the world"". [ 20 ]  Many of these protests have been organised from the growing  shanty towns  that surround South African cities.     Foreign relations and military       Main articles:  South African National Defence Force ,  Foreign relations of South Africa , and  South Africa and weapons of mass destruction       Since the end of apartheid, the South African foreign policy has focused on its African partners particularly in the  Southern African Development Community  (SADC) and the  African Union . South Africa has played a key role as a mediator in African conflicts over the last decade, such as in  Burundi , the  Democratic Republic of Congo , the  Comoros , and  Zimbabwe . After apartheid ended, South Africa was readmitted to the  Commonwealth of Nations . As the  Union of South Africa , South Africa was a founding member of the  United Nations  and the then Prime Minister  Jan Smuts  wrote the preamble to its constitution. South Africa is currently a non-permanent member of the  United Nations Security Council  and has attracted controversy by voting against a resolution criticising the  Burmese  government in 2006 and against the implementation of sanctions against  Zimbabwe  in 2008. South Africa is a member of the  Group of 77  and chaired the organisation in 2006. South Africa is a member of the  South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone ,  Southern African Customs Union ,  World Trade Organization ,  International Monetary Fund ,  G20  and  G8+5 .   The South African  armed forces , known as the  South African National Defence Force  (SANDF), was created in 1994. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  Previously known as the  South African Defence Force  (SADF), the new force is an all volunteer army and consists of the forces of the old SADF, as well as the forces of the African nationalist groups, namely  Umkhonto we Sizwe  (MK),  Azanian People's Liberation Army  (APLA), and the former  Bantustan  defence forces. [ 21 ]  The SANDF is subdivided into four branches, the  South African Army , the  South African Air Force , the  South African Navy , and the  South African Military Health Services . [ 23 ]   In recent years, the SANDF has become a major  peacekeeping  force in Africa, [ 24 ]  and has been involved in operations in  Lesotho , the  Democratic Republic of the Congo , [ 24 ]  and  Burundi , [ 24 ]  amongst others. It has also participated as a part of multi-national  UN  peacekeeping forces.   South Africa undertook a nuclear weapons programme in the 1970s [ 25 ]  and  may have conducted  a nuclear test over the  Atlantic  in 1979. [ 26 ]  It is the only African country to have successfully  developed nuclear weapons . It has become the first country (followed by Ukraine) with nuclear capability to voluntarily renounce and dismantle its programme and in the process signed the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty  in 1991. [ 25 ]     Provinces, districts and municipalities       Main articles:  Provinces of South Africa ,  Districts of South Africa , and  Municipalities of South Africa              Map showing the provinces and districts (numbered) of South Africa.             Northern Cape          North West          Gauteng          Limpopo          Mpumalanga            KwaZulu-Natal          Eastern Cape          Free State          Western Cape               When apartheid ended in 1994, the South African government had to integrate the formerly independent and semi-independent  Bantustans  into the political structure of South Africa. To this end, it abolished the four former provinces of South Africa ( Cape Province ,  Natal ,  Orange Free State , and  Transvaal ) and replaced them with nine fully integrated provinces. The new provinces are usually much smaller than the former provinces, which theoretically gives local governments more resources to distribute over smaller areas.   The nine provinces are further subdivided into  52 districts :  6 metropolitan  and  46 district municipalities . The 46 district municipalities are further subdivided into  231 local municipalities . The district municipalities also contain 20 district management areas (mostly game parks) that are directly governed by the district municipalities. The six metropolitan municipalities perform the functions of both district and local municipalities.

At 470,979  sq mi  (1,219,912 km), [ 27 ]  South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world (after  Mali ). It is comparable in size to  Colombia .  Njesuthi  in the  Drakensberg  at 3,408 m (11,424 ft) is the highest peak in South Africa.          View of the  Drakensberg mountains , the highest mountain range in South Africa.       South Africa has a generally  temperate climate , due in part to it being surrounded by the  Atlantic  and  Indian Oceans  on three sides, by its location in the climatically milder  southern hemisphere  and due to the average elevation rising steadily towards the north (towards the  equator ) and further inland. Due to this varied topography and oceanic influence, a great variety of climatic zones exist.   The climatic zones vary, from the extreme  desert  of the southern  Namib  in the farthest northwest to the lush  subtropical  climate in the east along the  Mozambique  border and the  Indian  ocean. From the east, the land quickly rises over a  mountainous   escarpment  towards the interior  plateau  known as the  Highveld . Even though South Africa is classified as  semi-arid , there is considerable variation in  climate  as well as  topography .   The interior of South Africa is a vast, rather flat, and sparsely populated  scrubland ,  Karoo , which is drier towards the northwest along the Namib desert. In contrast, the eastern coastline is lush and well-watered, which produces a climate similar to the tropics. The extreme southwest has a climate remarkably similar to that of the  Mediterranean  with wet winters and hot, dry summers, hosting the famous  Fynbos   Biome . This area also produces much of the  wine  in South Africa. This region is also particularly known for its wind, which blows intermittently almost all year. The severity of this wind made passing around the  Cape of Good Hope  particularly treacherous for sailors, causing many  shipwrecks . Further east on the south coast, rainfall is distributed more evenly throughout the year, producing a green landscape. This area is popularly known as the  Garden Route .          Satellite picture of South Africa       The  Free State  is particularly flat due to the fact that it lies centrally on the high plateau. North of the  Vaal River , the Highveld becomes better watered and does not experience subtropical extremes of heat.  Johannesburg , in the centre of the Highveld, is at 1,740 metres (5,709 ft) and receives an annual rainfall of 760 millimetres (30  in ). Winters in this region are cold, although  snow  is rare.   To the north of Johannesburg, the altitude drops beyond the escarpment of the Highveld, and turns into the lower lying Bushveld, an area of mixed dry forest and an abundance of wildlife. East of the Highveld, beyond the eastern escarpment, the Lowveld stretches towards the  Indian  ocean. It has particularly high temperatures, and is also the location of extended subtropical agriculture.   The high  Drakensberg mountains , which form the south-eastern escarpment of the Highveld, offer limited  skiing  opportunities in winter. The coldest place in South Africa is  Sutherland  in the western  Roggeveld Mountains , where midwinter temperatures can reach as low as 15 degrees  Celsius  (5  F ). The deep interior has the hottest temperatures: A temperature of 51.7 C (125 F) was recorded in 1948 in the  Northern Cape  Kalahari near  Upington . [ 28 ]   South Africa also has one possession, the small sub-Antarctic archipelago of the  Prince Edward Islands , consisting of  Marion Island  (290 km/112 sq mi) and Prince Edward Island (45 km/17.3 sq mi) (not to be confused with the  Canadian province of the same name ).           Weather averages for Cape Town, South Africa         Month   Jan   Feb   Mar   Apr   May   Jun   Jul   Aug   Sep   Oct   Nov   Dec   Year       Average high C (F)   27  (81)   28  (82)   26  (79)   24  (75)   20  (68)   18  (64)   17  (63)   18  (64)   19  (66)   22  (72)   24  (75)   26  (79)   28  (82)       Average low C (F)   16  (61)   16  (61)   15  (59)   13  (55)   10  (50)   8  (46)   8  (46)   8  (46)   9  (48)   11  (52)   14  (57)   15  (59)   8  (46)       Precipitation  mm (inches)   16.5  (0.65)   13  (0.51)   20  (0.79)   54  (2.13)   92  (3.62)   111  (4.37)   96  (3.78)   87  (3.43)   56  (2.2)   40  (1.57)   24  (0.94)   18  (0.71)   627  (24.69)       Source: EuroWEATHER [ 29 ]  2008-02-22         Flora and fauna     See also:  Wildlife of South Africa   See also:  Protected areas of South Africa             Fynbos , a  floral kingdom  unique to South Africa, is found near  Cape Town               Swartberg  mountains near the town of  Oudtshoorn              A field of flowers in Weskus National Park.       South Africa is one of only 17 countries worldwide considered  megadiverse . It has more than 20,000 different  plants , or about 10% of all the known  species  of plants on  Earth , making it particularly rich in plant biodiversity. South Africa is the 6th most biodiverse country, [ 30 ]  after  Brazil ,  Colombia ,  Indonesia ,  China , and  Mexico . The most prevalent biome in South Africa is the  grassland , particularly on the  Highveld , where the plant cover is dominated by different  grasses , low  shrubs , and  acacia trees , mainly camel-thorn and whitethorn.  Vegetation  becomes even more sparse towards the northwest due to low  rainfall . There are several species of water-storing  succulents  like  aloes  and euphorbias in the very hot and dry  Namaqualand  area. The grass and thorn  savannah  turns slowly into a bush savannah towards the north-east of the country, with denser growth. There are significant numbers of  baobab  trees in this area, near the northern end of  Kruger National Park . [ 31 ]   The  Fynbos   Biome , which makes up the majority of the area and plant life in the  Cape floristic region , one of the six  floral kingdoms , is located in a small region of the  Western Cape  and contains more than 9,000 of those species, making it among the richest regions on earth in terms of floral biodiversity. The majority of the plants are  evergreen  hard-leaf plants with fine, needle-like  leaves , such as the  sclerophyllous  plants. Another uniquely South African plant is the  protea  genus of flowering plants. There are around 130 different species of protea in South Africa.   While South Africa has a great wealth of flowering plants, it has few  forests . Only 1% of South Africa is forest, almost exclusively in the  humid   coastal plain  along the  Indian Ocean  in  KwaZulu-Natal  (see  KwaZulu-Cape coastal forest mosaic ). There are even smaller reserves of forests that are out of the reach of  fire , known as montane forests (see  Knysna-Amatole montane forests ).  Plantations  of imported tree species are predominant, particularly the non-native  eucalyptus  and  pine . South Africa has lost a large area of natural habitat in the last four decades, primarily due to  overpopulation , sprawling development patterns and  deforestation  during the nineteenth century. South Africa is one of the worst affected countries in the world when it comes to invasion by alien species with many (e.g.  Black Wattle ,  Port Jackson ,  Hakea ,  Lantana  and  Jacaranda ) posing a significant threat to the native  biodiversity  and the already scarce water resources. The original  temperate forest  that met the first European settlers to South Africa was exploited ruthlessly until only small patches remained. Currently, South African  hardwood  trees like  Real Yellowwood   (Podocarpus latifolius) ,  stinkwood   (Ocotea bullata) , and South African  Black Ironwood   (Olea laurifolia)  are under government protection.   Numerous  mammals  are found in the  bushveld  habitats including  lions ,  leopards ,  white rhinos ,  blue wildebeest ,  kudus ,  impalas ,  hyenas ,  hippopotamus  and  giraffes . A significant extent of the bushveld habitat exists in the north-east including  Kruger National Park  and the  Mala Mala  Reserve, as well as in the far north in the  Waterberg Biosphere .   Climate change is expected to bring considerable warming and drying to much of this already semi-arid region, with greater frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, flooding and drought. According to computer generated climate modelling produced by the South African National Biodiversity Institute [ 32 ]  parts of southern Africa will see an increase in temperature by about one degree Celsius along the coast to more than four degrees Celsius in the already hot hinterland such as the  Northern Cape  in late spring and summertime by 2050.   The Cape Floral Kingdom has been identified as one of the global  biodiversity hotspots  since it will be hit very hard by  climate change  and has such a great diversity of life. Drought, increased intensity and frequency of fire and climbing temperatures are expected to push many of these  rare species  towards  extinction .   South Africa houses many endemic species, among them the  critically endangered   Riverine Rabbit  ( Bunolagus monticullaris ) in the  Karoo .     Economy       Main article:  Economy of South Africa              The  Victoria & Alfred Waterfront  in  Cape Town  with  Table Mountain  in the background. Cape Town has become an important  retail  and  tourism  centre for the country, and attracts the largest number of foreign visitors in South Africa       By  UN  classification South Africa is a middle-income country with an abundant supply of resources, well-developed financial, legal, communications, energy, and transport sectors, a  stock exchange  (the  JSE Limited ), that ranks among the top twenty in the world, and a modern infrastructure supporting an efficient distribution of goods to major urban centres throughout the entire region. South Africa is ranked 25th in the world in terms of  GDP  (PPP) as of 2007.   Advanced development is significantly localised around four areas: Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Durban, and Pretoria/Johannesburg. Beyond these four economic centres, development is marginal and poverty is still prevalent despite government efforts. Consequently the vast majority of South Africans are poor. However, key marginal areas have experienced rapid growth recently. Such areas include Mossel Bay to Plettenberg Bay; Rustenburg area; Nelspruit area; Bloemfontein; Cape West Coast; and the KwaZulu-Natal North Coast.   Even though South Africa has the seventh highest per capita income in Africa, only behind  Libya ,  Mauritius  it suffers from large income gaps and a  dual economy  marking it as a  developing country . South Africa has one of the highest rates of  income inequality  in the world. A decade of continual economic growth has helped to lower unemployment, but daunting economic and social problems remain. The average South African household income decreased considerably between 1995 and 2000. As for racial inequality,  Statistics South Africa  reported that in 1995 the average white household earned four times as much as the average black household. In 2000 the average white household was earning six times more than the average black household. [ 33 ]  The  affirmative action  policies have seen a rise in black economic wealth and an emerging black middle class. [ 34 ]  Other problems are crime, corruption, and  HIV / AIDS .   At the start of 2000, then President Thabo Mbeki vowed to promote economic growth and foreign investment by relaxing restrictive labour laws, stepping up the pace of  privatisation , and cutting unneeded governmental spending. His policies face strong opposition from organised  labour . South Africa is also the largest energy producer and consumer on the continent. South Africa is a popular tourist destination, and a substantial amount of revenue comes from tourism. [ 35 ]  Among the main attractions are the diverse and picturesque culture, the game reserves and the highly regarded local wines.   The South African  rand  (ZAR), is the most actively traded emerging  market currency  in the world. It has joined an elite club of fifteen currencies, the  Continuous linked settlement  (CLS), where forex transactions are settled immediately, lowering the risks of transacting across  time zones . The rand was the best-performing currency against the  United States dollar  (USD) between 2002 and 2005, according to the  Bloomberg  Currency Scorecard.   The volatility of the  rand  has affected economic activity, falling sharply during 2001 and hitting a historic low of 13.85  ZAR  to the  USD , raising fears of inflation, and causing the Reserve Bank to increase  interest rates . The rand has since recovered, trading at 7.13 ZAR to the dollar as of January 2008. However, as exporters are put under considerable pressure from a stronger domestic currency, many call for government intervention to help soften the rand.   Refugees from poorer neighbouring countries include many immigrants from the DRC, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Malawi and others, representing a large portion of the informal sector. With high unemployment levels amongst poorer South Africans,  xenophobia  is prevalent and many people born in South Africa feel resentful of immigrants who are seen to be depriving the native population of jobs, a feeling which has been given credibility by the fact that many South African employers have employed migrants from other countries for lower pay than South African citizens, especially in the  construction ,  tourism ,  agriculture  and  domestic service  industries. Illegal immigrants are also heavily involved in informal trading. [ 36 ]  However, many immigrants to South Africa continue to live in poor conditions, and the South African immigration policy has become increasingly restrictive since 1994. [ 37 ]   Principal international trading partners of South Africa  besides other African countries  include  Germany ,  Japan ,  Switzerland , the  United Kingdom , and the  United States . Chief exports include  corn ,  diamonds ,  fruits ,  gold ,  metals  and  minerals ,  sugar , and  wool .  Machinery  and transportation equipment make up more than one-third of the value of the countrys imports. Other imports include  chemicals , manufactured goods, and  petroleum .     Electricity crisis   After unsuccessful attempts by the government to encourage private construction of electricity generation capacity, in 2007 the state-owned electricity supplier ( Eskom ) started experiencing a lack of capacity in the electrical generating and reticulation infrastructure. This led to an inability to meet the routine demands of industry and consumers, resulting in countrywide  rolling blackouts . Initially the lack of capacity was triggered by a failure at  Koeberg nuclear power station , but since then a general lack of capacity became evident. The supplier has been widely criticised for failing to adequately plan for and construct sufficient electrical generating capacity, [ 38 ]  although ultimately the government has admitted that it is at fault for refusing to approve funding for investment in infrastructure. [ 39 ]     Agriculture          Workers planting on a farm in the central area of  Mpumalanga .               Farm  workers.       South Africa has a large agricultural sector and is a net exporter of  farming  products. There are almost a thousand  agricultural cooperatives  and  agribusinesses  throughout the country, and agricultural exports have constituted 8% of South African total exports for the past five years. The agricultural industry contributes around 10% of formal employment, relatively low compared to other parts of Africa, as well as providing work for casual labourers and contributing around 2.6% of  GDP  for the nation. [ 40 ]  However, due to the  aridity  of the land, only 13.5% can be used for crop production, and only 3% is considered high potential land. [ 41 ]   Although the commercial farming sector is relatively well developed, people in some rural areas still survive on  subsistence agriculture . It is the eighth largest wine producer in the world, and the eleventh largest producer of sunflower seed. South Africa is a net exporter of agricultural products and foodstuffs, the largest number of exported items being  sugar ,  grapes ,  citrus ,  nectarines ,  wine  and  deciduous  fruit. The largest locally produced crop is  maize  (corn), and it has been estimated that 9 million tons are produced every year, with 7.4 million tons being consumed.  Livestock  are also popular on South African farms, with the country producing 85% of all meat consumed. The dairy industry consists of around 4,300 milk producers providing employment for 60,000 farm workers and contributing to the livelihoods of around 40,000 others. [ 42 ]   In recent years, the agricultural sector has introduced several reforms, some of which are controversial, such as  land reform  and the deregulation of the market for agricultural products. Land reform has been criticised both by farmers' groups and by landless workers, the latter alleging that the pace of change has not been fast enough, and the former alleging racist treatment and expressing concerns that a similar situation to  Zimbabwe's land reform policy  may develop, [ 43 ]  a fear exacerbated by comments made by  deputy president , the deputy president of South Africa. [ 44 ] [ 45 ]  The sector continues to face problems, with increased foreign competition and crime being two of the major challenges for the industry. The government has been accused of either putting in too much effort [ 46 ] , or not enough effort [ 47 ] , to tackle the problem of  farm attacks  as opposed to other forms of violent crime.   Another issue which affects South African agriculture is environmental damage caused by misuse of the land and global climate change. South Africa is unusually vulnerable to climate change and resultant diminution of surface waters. Some predictions show surface water supply could decrease by 60% by the year 2070 in parts of the Western Cape. [ 48 ]  To reverse the damage caused by land mismanagement, the government has supported a scheme which promotes  sustainable development  and the use of natural resources. [ 49 ]  Maize production, which contributes to a 36% majority of the gross value of South Africas field crops, has also experienced negative effects due to climate change. The estimated value of loss, which takes into consideration scenarios with and without the carbon dioxide fertilization effect [2]  ,ranges between 10s to 100s of millions of Rands.

South Africa is a nation of more than 48 million people of diverse origins,  cultures ,  languages , and  religions . The last  census  was held in 2001 and the next will be in 2011.  Statistics South Africa  provided five  racial  categories by which people could classify themselves, the last of which, ""unspecified/other"" drew negligible responses, and these results were omitted. [ 51 ]  The 2006 midyear estimated figures for the other categories were  Black African  at 79.5%,  White  at 9.2%,  Coloured  at 8.9%, and  Indian or Asian  at 2.5%. [ 52 ]  Even though the population of South Africa has increased in the past decade [ 51 ] [ 53 ]  (primarily due to immigration), the country had an annual population growth rate of 0.501% in 2008 (CIA est.), including immigration. [ 54 ]  South Africa is home to an estimated 5 million  illegal immigrants , including some 3 million  Zimbabweans . [ 55 ] [ 56 ] [ 57 ]  A series of  anti-immigrant riots  occurred in South Africa beginning on 11 May 2008. [ 58 ] [ 59 ]   By far the major part of the population classified itself as African or black, but it is not culturally or linguistically homogeneous. Major ethnic groups include the  Zulu ,  Xhosa ,  Basotho  (South Sotho),  Bapedi  (North Sotho),  Venda ,  Tswana ,  Tsonga ,  Swazi  and  Ndebele , all of which speak  Bantu languages  (see  Bantu peoples of South Africa ).   Some, such as the Zulu, Xhosa, Bapedi and Venda groups, are unique to South Africa. Other groups are distributed across the borders with neighbours of South Africa: The  Basotho  group is also the major ethnic group in  Lesotho . The  Tswana  ethnic group constitute the majority of the population of  Botswana . The  Swazi  ethnic group is the major ethnic group in  Swaziland . The  Ndebele  ethnic group is also found in  Matabeleland  in  Zimbabwe , where they are known as the  Matabele . These Ndebele people are the descendants of a Zulu faction under the warrior  Mzilikazi  that escaped persecution from  Shaka  by migrating to their current territory. The  Tsonga  ethnic group is also found in southern  Mozambique , where they are known as the Shangaan.   The white population is not ethnically homogenous and descend from many ethnic groups:  Dutch ,  Flemish ,  Portuguese , German, French  Huguenot , English, Irish, Italian, Scottish and  Welsh . Culturally and linguistically, they are divided into the  Afrikaners , who speak  Afrikaans , and English-speaking groups, many of whom are descended from British and Irish immigrants (see  Anglo-African ). Many small communities that have immigrated over the last century retain the use of other languages. The  white population  is on the decrease due to a low birth rate and emigration; as a factor in their decision to emigrate, many cite the high  crime  rate and the  affirmative action  policies of the government. Since 1994, approximately 1 000 000 white South Africans have permanently emigrated. [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ] [ 63 ]  Despite high emigration levels, a high level of non-South African white immigrants have settled in the country, in particular from countries such as  Britain  and  Zimbabwe . For example, by 2005, an estimated 212 000 British citizens were residing in South Africa. Since 2003, the numbers of British migrants coming to South Africa has risen by 50%. An estimated 20 000 British migrants moved to South Africa in 2007. There have also been a significant number of  white Zimbabwean  arrivals, fleeing their home country in light of the economic and political problems currently facing the country. As well as recent arrivals, a significant number of white Zimbabweans emigrated to South Africa in the wake of independence in Zimbabwe in 1980. Some of the more nostalgic members of the community are known in popular culture as "" Whenwes "", because of their nostalgia for their lives in  Rhodesia  ""when we were in Rhodesia"". [ 64 ]   The term  Coloured  is still largely used for the people of mixed race descended from slaves brought in from East and Central Africa, the indigenous  Khoisan  who lived in the  Cape  at the time, Bantus, Whites (mostly the  Dutch / Afrikaner  and British settlers) as well as an admixture of  Javanese ,  Malay , Indian,  Malagasy  and Asian blood (such as  Burmese ). The majority speak Afrikaans. Khoisan is a term used to describe two separate groups, physically similar: light-skinned and small in stature. The  Khoikhoi , who were called  Hottentots  by the Europeans, were pastoralists and were annihilated; the San, called  Bushmen  by the Europeans, were hunter-gatherers. Within the Coloured community, more recent immigrants will also be found: Coloureds from the former  Rhodesia  (now  Zimbabwe );  Namibia  and immigrants of mixed descent from India and  Burma  ( Anglo-Indians / Anglo-Burmese ) who were welcomed to the Cape when India and Burma received their Independence.   The major part of the South African  Asian  population is Indian in origin (see  Indian South Africans ); many of them descended from indentured workers brought in the nineteenth century to work on the  sugar   plantations  of the eastern coastal area then known as  Natal . There is also a significant group of  Chinese South Africans  (approximately 100,000 individuals) and  Vietnamese  South Africans (approximately 50,000 individuals). In 2008, the Pretoria High Court has ruled that Chinese South Africans who arrived before 1994 are to be reclassified as  Coloureds . As a result of this ruling, about 12,000 - 15,000  [ 65 ] ethnically Chinese citizens who arrived before 1994, numbering 3%-5% of the total Chinese population in the country, will be able to benefit from government  BEE  policies. [ 66 ]   South Africa hosts a sizeable refugee and asylum seeker population. According to the  World Refugee Survey 2008 , published by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, this population numbered approximately 144,700 in 2007. [ 67 ]  Groups of refugees and asylum seekers numbering over 10,000 included people from  Zimbabwe  (48,400), The  Democratic Republic of the Congo  (24,800), and  Somalia  (12,900). [ 67 ]  These populations mainly lived in Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban, Cape Town, and Port Elizabeth. [ 67 ]     Science and technology   Several important scientific and technological developments have originated in South Africa.  The first human to human heart transplant was performed by cardiac surgeon  Christiaan Barnard  at  Groote Schuur Hospital  in December 1967  .  Max Theiler  developed a vaccine against Yellow Fever,  Allan McLeod Cormack  pioneered x-ray  Computed tomography , and  Aaron Klug  developed crystallographic electron microscopy techniques. These advancements were all recognized with  Nobel Prizes .  Sydney Brenner  won most recently, in 2002, for his pioneering work in  molecular biology .   Mark Shuttleworth  founded an early Internet security company  Thawte , that was subsequently bought out by world-leader  VeriSign . Despite government efforts to encourage entrepreneurship in biotechnology, IT and other high technology fields, no other notable groundbreaking companies have been founded in South Africa. However, it is the expressed objective of the government to transition the economy to be more reliant on high technology, based on the realization that South African cannot compete with Far Eastern economies in manufacturing, nor can the republic rely on its mineral wealth in perpetuity.   South Africa has cultivated a burgeoning astronomy community. It hosts the  Southern African Large Telescope , the largest optical telescope in the southern hemisphere. South Africa is currently building the  Karoo Array Telescope  as a pathfinder for the $20 billion  Square Kilometer Array  project. South Africa is a finalist, with Australia, to be the host of the SKA.     Society and culture       Main article:  Culture of South Africa              Decorated houses,  Drakensberg Mountains              Traditional  South African cuisine .       It may be argued that there is no ""single"" culture in South Africa because of its ethnic diversity. Today, the diversity in foods from many cultures is enjoyed by all and especially marketed to tourists who wish to sample the large variety of South African cuisine. In addition to  food ,  music  and  dance  feature prominently.   South African cuisine  is heavily  meat-based  and has spawned the distinctively South African social gathering known as a  braai , or barbecue. South Africa has also developed into a major  wine  producer, with some of the best  vineyards  lying in valleys around  Stellenbosch ,  Franschoek ,  Paarl  and  Barrydale . [ 68 ]   There is great diversity in music from South Africa. Many black musicians who sang in Afrikaans or English during apartheid have since begun to sing in traditional African languages, and have developed a unique style called  Kwaito . Of note is  Brenda Fassie , who launched to fame with her song ""Weekend Special"", which was sung in English. More famous traditional musicians include  Ladysmith Black Mambazo , while the  Soweto String Quartet  performs classic music with an African flavour. White and Coloured South African singers are historically influenced by European musical styles including such western metal bands such as  Seether  (formerly Saron Gas). South Africa has produced world-famous jazz musicians, notably  Hugh Masekela ,  Jonas Gwangwa ,  Abdullah Ibrahim ,  Miriam Makeba ,  Jonathan Butler ,  Chris McGregor , and  Sathima Bea Benjamin .  Afrikaans  music covers multiple genres, such as the  contemporary   Steve Hofmeyr  and the  punk rock  band  Fokofpolisiekar . Crossover artists such as  Johnny Clegg  and his bands  Juluka  and  Savuka  have enjoyed various success underground, publicly, and abroad.   The South African black majority still has a substantial number of rural inhabitants who lead largely impoverished lives. It is among these people, however, that cultural traditions survive most strongly; as blacks have become increasingly  urbanised  and  westernised , aspects of traditional culture have declined. Urban blacks usually speak English or  Afrikaans  in addition to their native tongue. There are smaller but still significant groups of speakers of  Khoisan languages  who are not included in the eleven official languages, but are one of the eight other officially recognised languages. There are small groups of speakers of  endangered languages , most of which are from the Khoi-San family, that receive no official status; however, some groups within South Africa are attempting to promote their use and revival.   The  middle class  lifestyle, predominantly of the white minority but with growing numbers of Black, Coloured and Indian people, [ 69 ]  is similar in many respects to that of people found in  Western Europe , North America and  Australasia . Members of the middle class often study and work abroad for greater exposure to the markets of the world.   Asians , predominantly of Indian origin, preserve their own cultural heritage, languages and religious beliefs, being either  Christian ,  Hindu  or  Sunni Muslim  and speaking English, with Indian languages like  Hindi ,  Telugu ,  Tamil  or  Gujarati  being spoken less frequently, but the majority of Indians being able to understand their mother tongue. The first Indians arrived on the famous  Truro ship  as  indentured labourers  in Natal to work the Sugar Cane Fields. There is a much smaller  Chinese  community in South Africa, although its numbers have increased due to immigration from  Republic of China  (Taiwan).   South Africa has also had a large influence in the  Scouting  movement, with many Scouting traditions and ceremonies coming from the experiences of  Robert Baden-Powell  (the founder of Scouting) during his time in South Africa as a military officer in the 1890s. The  South African Scout Association  was one of the first youth organisations to open its doors to youth and adults of all races in South Africa. This happened on 2 July 1977 at a conference known as  Quo Vadis . [ 70 ]   The South African music scene consists of  Kwaito , a new music genre that had developed in the mid 80s and has since developed to become the most popular social economical form of representation among the populous. Though some may argue that the political aspects of Kwaito has since diminished after  Apartheid , and the relative interest in politics has become a minor aspect of daily life. Some argue that in a sense,  Kwaito  is in fact a political force that shows activism in its apolitical actions. Today, major corporations like  Sony ,  BMG , and  EMI  have appeared on the South African scene to produce and distribute  Kwaito  music. Due to its overwhelming popularity, as well as the general influence of DJs, who are among the top 5 most influential types of people within the country,  Kwaito  has taken over radio, television, and magazines. [ 71 ]   Kwaito , much like most hip-hop has its own local flavor and originality. However, unlike when hip-hop first burst on the scene as a politically driven and rebellious underground movement, South Africans wanted to create a happier vibe. As the post-apartheid fog cleared, South African youth found their ""own voice in a style of music known as kwaito, spawning a new (and profitable) industry"". [ 72 ]  According to TIMEeurope magazine, ""The kwaito sound now regularly incorporates traditional African music, jazz, gospel, and even rock guitar, most notably on Mandoza's 2000 hit Nkalakatha, one of the few kwaito records to cross over onto traditionally white radio"". [ 73 ]  In the kwaito, the samples from old school  Jamaican dancehall , European house, etc.,  tempos  are changed, beats are added, and urban street slang is also incorporated. This local flavor of music more recently has been attacked for its lack of ingenuity and its betrayal of its roots. The melodies and the incorporation of sex and dance have since become very similar to the American standard. In addition Kwaito has been criticised for its absence of influential lyrical content. As Kwaito is still a developing genre, and since the South African population is only around 48 million, sales of only 25,000 CDs are required for ""gold"" certification in South Africa. [ 72 ]     Religion       Main article:  Religion in South Africa               St. Mark 's Anglican Cathedral.       According to the latest 2001 national census, Christians accounted for 79.7% of the population. This includes  Zion Christian  11.1%,  Pentecostal  ( Charismatic ) 8.2%,  Roman Catholic  7.1%,  Methodist  6.8%,  Dutch Reformed  6.7%,  Anglican  3.8%, and other Christian 36%.  Islam  accounted for 1.5% of the population,  Hinduism  about 1.3%, and  Judaism  0.2%. 15.1% had no religious affiliation, 2.3% were other and 1.4% were unspecified. [ 74 ] [ 75 ]   African Indigenous Churches were the largest of the  Christian  groups. It was believed that many of these persons who claimed no affiliation with any organised religion adhered to  traditional indigenous religions . Many peoples have  syncretic  religious practices combining Christian and indigenous influences. [ 76 ]   Islam in South Africa  itself is not known to pre-date the colonial period, despite the isolated contact neighbouring  Mozambique  had with  Arab  and  East African  traders. [ citation needed ]  There is no evidence that Islam was known to the  Zulu ,  Swazi , or  Xhosa  of the east coast prior to the colonial era. Many South African Muslims are described as  Coloureds , notably in the  Western Cape , especially those whose ancestors came as slaves from the Indonesian archipelago (the  Cape Malays ). Others are described as  Indians , notably in  KwaZulu-Natal , including those whose ancestors came as traders from  South Asia ; they have been joined by others from other parts of Africa as well as white or black South African converts. It is estimated that  Islam  is the fastest growing religion of conversion in the country, [ 77 ]  with the number of black  Muslims  growing sixfold, from 12,000 in 1991 to 74,700 in 2004. [ 78 ]   Hinduism  dates back to British Colonial period primarily but later waves of continuous immigrants from India have contributed to a sizable Hindu population. Most Hindus are ethnically South Asian but there are many who come from mixed racial stock and many are converts with the efforts of Hindu missionaries such as ISKCON. Other religions in smaller numbers are  Sikhism ,  Jainism  and  Bah' Faith . [ 75 ]     Languages       Main article:  Languages of South Africa              Map showing principal South African languages by municipality. Lighter shades indicate a non-majority  plurality .             Afrikaans          Northern Sotho          Southern Sotho          Swati          Tsonga            Tswana          Venda          Xhosa          Zulu               South Africa has eleven  official languages : [ 79 ]   Sepedi ,  Sesotho ,  Setswana ,  siSwati ,  Tshivenda ,  Xitsonga ,  Afrikaans ,  English ,  isiNdebele ,  isiXhosa  and  isiZulu . In this regard it is  second only to India  in number. While each language is formally equal to every other, some languages are spoken more than others. According to the 2001 National Census, the three most spoken first home languages are Zulu (23.8%), Xhosa (17.6%) and Afrikaans (13.3%). [ 51 ]  Despite the fact that English is recognised as the language of commerce and science, it was spoken by only 8.2% of South Africans at home in 2001, an even lower percentage than in 1996 (8.6%). [ 51 ]   There are  eleven official names  for South Africa, one in each of the official national languages. The country also recognises eight non-official languages:  Fanagalo ,  Khoe ,  Lobedu ,  Nama ,  Northern Ndebele ,  Phuthi ,  San  and  South African Sign Language . [ citation needed ]  These non-official languages may be used in certain official uses in limited areas where it has been determined that these languages are prevalent. Nevertheless, their populations are not such that they require nationwide recognition.   Many of the ""unofficial languages"" of the  San  and  Khoikhoi  people contain regional  dialects  stretching northward into Namibia and Botswana, and elsewhere. These people, who are a physically distinct population from other Africans, have their own cultural identity based on their  hunter-gatherer  societies. They have been marginalised to a great extent, and many of their languages are in danger of becoming  extinct .   Many white South Africans also speak other European languages, such as  Portuguese  (also spoken by Angolan and Mozambican blacks), German, and  Greek , while some  Asians  and  Indians  in South Africa speak  South Asian  languages, such as  Tamil ,  Hindi ,  Gujarati ,  Urdu  and  Telugu .  French  is still widely spoken by French South Africans especially in places like  Franschhoek , where many South Africans are of French origin. South African French is spoken by less than 10,000 individuals. Congolese French is also spoken in South Africa by migrants.

Other sports with significant support are  swimming ,  golf  and  netball .  Basketball ,  surfing  and  skateboarding  are popular among the youth.   Famous boxing personalities include Baby Jake  Jacob Matlala ,  Vuyani Bungu ,  Welcome Ncita ,  Dingaan Thobela ,  Gerrie Coetzee  and  Brian Mitchell . Football players who have excelled in international clubs include  Lucas Radebe  of  Leeds United  and  Quinton Fortune , formerly of  Manchester United ,  Benni McCarthy  and  Aaron Mokoena  of  Blackburn Rovers  and  Steven Pienaar  of  Everton . South Africa produced  Formula 1  motor racing's 1979 world champion  Jody Scheckter .   South Africa hosted and won the  1995 Rugby World Cup  at their first attempt and again won the  2007 Rugby World Cup  in  France . South Africa was only allowed to participate from 1995 since the end of  Apartheid . It followed the 1995 Rugby World Cup by hosting and winning the  1996 African Cup of Nations  football tournament. It also hosted the  2003 Cricket World Cup  and the  2007 World Twenty20 Championship . South Africa will be the host nation for the  2010 FIFA World Cup , which will be the first time the tournament is held on the African continent.   In 2004, the swim team of  Roland Schoeman ,  Lyndon Ferns ,  Darian Townsend  and  Ryk Neethling  won the gold medal at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, simultaneously breaking the world record in the 4x100 freestyle relay.  Penny Heyns  won Olympic Gold in the 1996  Atlanta Olympic Games .   In golf,  Gary Player  is generally regarded as one of the greatest golfers of all time, having won the  Career Grand Slam , one of five golfers to have done so. Other South African golfers to have successfully won a major tournament include  Bobby Locke ,  Ernie Els ,  Retief Goosen  and  Trevor Immelman .     Current issues     HIV/AIDS       Main article:  HIV/AIDS in South Africa       The spread of  AIDS  (acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome) is an alarming problem in South Africa with up to 31% of pregnant women found to be HIV infected in 2005 and the infection rate among adults estimated at 20%. [ 80 ]  The link between HIV, a virus spread primarily by sexual contact, and AIDS was long denied by prior president  Thabo Mbeki  and then health minister  Manto Tshabalala-Msimang , who insisted that the many deaths in the country are due to malnutrition, and hence poverty, and not HIV. [ 81 ]  In 2007, in response to international pressure, the government made efforts to fight AIDS. [ 82 ]  In September 2008 Thabo Mbeki was ousted by the ANC and  Kgalema Motlanthe  was appointed for the interim. One of Mr. Motlanthe's first actions was to replace Mrs. Tshabalala-Msimang with the current minister,  Barbara Hogan .   AIDS affects mainly those who are sexually active and is far more prevalent in the black population. Most deaths are people who are also economically active, resulting in many families losing their primary wage earners. This has resulted in many 'AIDS orphans' who in many cases depend on the state for care and financial support. [ 83 ]  It is estimated that there are 1,200,000 orphans in South Africa. [ 83 ]  Many elderly people also lose the support from lost younger members of their family. Roughly 5 million people are infected with the disease. [ 82 ]     Crime       Main article:  Crime in South Africa               Prison  buildings on  Robben Island       According to a survey for the period 19982000 compiled by the  United Nations , South Africa was ranked second for  murder  and first for  assaults  and  rapes  per capita. [ 84 ]  Total crime per capita is 10th out of the 60 countries in the data set.   Crime  has had a pronounced effect on society: many middle-class South Africans moved into  gated communities , abandoning the central business districts of some cities for the relative security of suburbs. This effect is most pronounced in  Johannesburg , although the trend is noticeable in other cities as well. [ citation needed ]  Many emigrants from South Africa also state that crime was a big motivator for them to leave.  Crime against the farming community  has continued to be a major problem. [ 85 ]     Skills migration   Along with many African nations, South Africa has been experiencing a "" brain drain "" in the past 20 years. This is believed to be potentially damaging for the regional economy, [ 86 ]  and is almost certainly detrimental for the well-being of the majority of people reliant on the healthcare infrastructure, given the HIV/AIDS epidemic. [ 87 ]  The skills drain in South Africa tends to demonstrate racial contours (naturally given the skills distribution legacy of South Africa) and has thus resulted in large white South African communities abroad. [ 88 ]     Xenophobia       Main article:  Xenophobia in South Africa       In May 2008 long standing state hostility to African migrants exploded in a series of pogroms that left up to 100 people dead and 100,000 displaced.

The South African coast stretches 2,798 kilometres (1,739 mi) [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  and borders both the  Atlantic  and  Indian   oceans . [ 7 ]  To the north of South Africa lie  Namibia ,  Botswana ,  Zimbabwe ,  Mozambique  and  Swaziland , while the  Kingdom of Lesotho  is an independent  enclave  surrounded by South African territory. [ 8 ]   Modern human beings have inhabited South Africa for more than 100,000 years. [ 9 ]  A century and a half after the discovery of the  Cape Sea Route , the  Dutch East India Company   founded  a refreshment station at what would become  Cape Town  in 1652. [ 10 ]  Cape Town became a British colony in 1806. European settlement expanded during the 1820s as the  Boers  (original  Dutch ,  Flemish ,  German  and  French  settlers) and the British  1820 Settlers  claimed land in the north and east of the country. Conflicts arose among the Xhosa, Zulu and Afrikaner groups. However, the discovery of diamonds and later gold triggered the conflict known as the  Anglo-Boer War  as the Boers and the British fought for the control of the South African mineral wealth. Although the Boers were defeated, limited independence was given to South Africa in 1910 as a British dominion. Anti-British policies focused on ultimate independence which was achieved in 1961 when South Africa was declared a  republic . The leading  National Party  legislated for a continuation of racial segregation begun under Dutch and British colonial rule, Boer republics, and subsequent South African governments (and which in 1948 became legally institutionalized  segregation  known as  apartheid ), despite opposition both in and outside of the country. In 1990 the then president  F.W. de Klerk  began to dismantle this legislation, and in 1994 the first democratic election was held in South Africa. This election brought  Nelson Mandela  and the current ruling party, the  African National Congress  to power, and the country rejoined the  Commonwealth of Nations .   South Africa is known for its diversity in cultures, languages, and religious beliefs, and eleven official languages are recognised in its  constitution . [ 7 ]  English is the most commonly spoken language in official and commercial public life, however it is only the fifth most spoken home language. [ 7 ]  South Africa is ethnically diverse, with the largest  Caucasian ,  Indian , and  racially mixed  communities in Africa. Although 79.6% of the South African population is  Black , [ 2 ]  this category is neither culturally nor linguistically homogenous, as people within this classification speak a number of different  Bantu languages , nine of which have official status. [ 7 ]  Midyear 2007, the South African population was estimated at 47.9 million.

(September 2008)           Main article:  History of South Africa       South Africa contains some of the oldest archaeological sites in the world. [ 11 ]   [ 12 ]  Extensive fossil remains at the  Sterkfontein ,  Kromdraai  and Makapansgat caves suggest that various  australopithecines  existed in South Africa from about three million years ago. [ 13 ]  These were succeeded by various species of  Homo , including  Homo habilis ,  Homo erectus  and modern humans,  Homo sapiens . Settlements of  Bantu -speaking peoples, who were  iron -using agriculturists and herdsmen, were already present south of the  Limpopo River  by the fourth or fifth century (see  Bantu expansion ) displacing and absorbing the original  KhoiSan  speakers. They slowly moved south and the earliest ironworks in modern-day  KwaZulu-Natal Province  are believed to date from around 1050. The southernmost group was the  Xhosa  people, whose language incorporates certain linguistic traits from the earlier KhoiSan people, reaching the  Fish River , in today's  Eastern Cape Province . These  Iron Age  populations displaced earlier people, who often had  hunter-gatherer  societies, as they migrated.     European colonisation          Painting of an account of the arrival of  Jan van Riebeeck , the first  European  to settle in South Africa, with  Devil's Peak  in the background       In 1487, the  Portuguese  explorer  Bartolomeu Dias  became the first European to reach the southernmost point of Africa. Initially named The Cape of Storms, The King of Portugal,  John II , renamed it the  Cabo da Boa Esperana  or  Cape of Good Hope  as it led to the riches of India. This great feat of navigation was later immortalized in  Cames ' epic Portuguese poem,  The Lusiads  (1572). In 1652, a refreshment station was established at the  Cape of Good Hope  by  Jan van Riebeeck  on behalf of the  Dutch East India Company .  Slaves  were brought from  Indonesia ,  Madagascar , and India as a labour source for the Dutch immigrants in  Cape Town . As they expanded east, the Dutch settlers eventually met the south-westerly expanding  Xhosa  people in the region of the  Fish River . A series of wars, called the  Cape Frontier Wars , ensued, mainly caused by conflicting land and livestock interests.   Great Britain  took over the  Cape of Good Hope  area in 1795 ostensibly to stop it falling into the hands of the Revolutionary French, but also seeking to use  Cape Town  in particular as a stop on the route to Australia and India. It was later returned to the Dutch in 1803, but soon afterwards the  Dutch East India Company  declared bankruptcy, and the British annexed the Cape Colony in 1806. The British continued the frontier wars against the Xhosa, pushing the eastern frontier eastward through a line of forts established along the Fish River and consolidating it by encouraging  British settlement . Due to pressure of  abolitionist  societies in Britain, the  British parliament  first stopped its global  slave trade  with the passage of the  Slave Trade Act 1807 , then abolished slavery in all its colonies with the  Slavery Abolition Act 1833 . During the 1830s, approximately 12 000  Boers  (later known as  Voortrekkers ), departed from the  Cape Colony , where they were subjected to British control, to the future Natal, Orange Free State and Transvaal regions. The Boers founded the  Boer Republics  - the  South African Republic  (Now  Gauteng ,  Limpopo ,  Mpumalanga  and  North West  provinces) and the  Orange Free State  ( Free State ).   The discovery of  diamonds  in 1867 and  gold  in 1884 in the interior encouraged economic growth and immigration, intensifying the subjugation of the indigenous people. These important economic resources did not only play a role between European and the indigenous population but also between the Boers and the British. [ 14 ]   The  Boer Republics  successfully resisted British encroachments during the  First Boer War  (18801881) using  guerrilla warfare  tactics, much better suited to local conditions. However, the British returned in greater numbers, more experience, and more suitable tactics in the  Second Boer War  (18991902). The Boers' attempt to ally themselves with  German South-West Africa  provided the British with yet another excuse to take control of the Boer Republics. [ citation needed ]           Boers  in combat (1881).         Independence   After four years of negotiating, the  Union of South Africa  was created from the  Cape  and  Natal  colonies, as well as the republics of  Orange Free State  and  Transvaal , on 31 May 1910, exactly eight years after the end of the Second Boer War. The newly created Union of South Africa was a  dominion . The  Natives' Land Act  of 1913 severely restricted the ownership of land by 'blacks', at that stage to a mere 7% of the country, although this amount was eventually increased marginally. [ 15 ]  The union was effectively granted independence from the United Kingdom with the passage of the  Statute of Westminster , which morphed the  British king's  position within South Africa into that of the distinct  King of South Africa . In 1934, the  South African Party  and  National Party  merged to form the  United Party , seeking reconciliation between Afrikaners and English-speaking ""Whites"", but split in 1939 over the entry of the Union into  World War II  as an ally of the United Kingdom, a move which the National Party strongly opposed.   In 1948, the  National Party  was elected to power, and intensified the implementation of racial segregation that had begun under Dutch and British colonial rule, and subsequent South African governments since the Union was formed. The Nationalist Government systematised existing segregationist laws, and the system of segregation became known collectively as  apartheid . Not surprisingly, this segregation also applied to the wealth acquired during rapid industrialisation of the 1950s, '60s, and '70s. While the White minority enjoyed the highest  standard of living  in all of Africa, often comparable to  First World  western nations, the Black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard, including income, education, housing, and life expectancy. On 31 May 1961, following a whites-only  referendum , the country became a  republic  and left the (British)  Commonwealth . The office of  Governor-General  was abolished and replaced with the position of  State President .   Apartheid became increasingly controversial, leading to widespread  sanctions ,  divestment  and growing unrest and oppression within South Africa. (See also the article on the  History of South Africa in the apartheid era .) A long period of harsh suppression by the government, and at times violent resistance,  strikes , marches, protests, and  sabotage  by bombing and other means, by various anti-apartheid movements, most notably the  African National Congress  (ANC), followed. In the late 1970s, South Africa began a programme of  nuclear weapons  development and in the following decade it produced six deliverable nuclear weapons. The rationale for the nuclear arsenal is disputed, but it is believed [ who? ]  that  Vorster  and  P.W. Botha  wanted to be able to catalyse American intervention in the event of a war between South Africa and the  Cuban -supported  MPLA  government of  Angola .     Democracy   In 1990 the  National Party  government took the first step towards negotiating itself out of power when it lifted the ban on the  African National Congress  and other  left-wing  political organisations, and released  Nelson Mandela  from prison after twenty-seven years' incarceration on a  sabotage  sentence. Apartheid legislation was gradually removed from the statute books, and South Africa also destroyed its nuclear arsenal and acceded to the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . The first  multi-racial elections  were held in 1994, which the ANC won by an overwhelming majority. It has been in power ever since.   In  post-apartheid South Africa , millions of South Africans, mostly black, continued to live in  poverty , though poverty among whites, previously rare, has increased greatly. [ 16 ]  While some have partly attributed this to the legacy of the apartheid system, increasingly many attribute it to the failure of the current government to tackle social issues, coupled with the monetary and fiscal discipline of the current government to ensure both redistribution of wealth and economic growth. Since the ANC-led government took power, the  United Nations   Human Development Index  of South Africa has fallen, while it was steadily rising until the mid-1990s. [ 17 ]  Some of this could possibly be attributed to the  AIDS   pandemic  and the failure of the government to take steps to address it, [ 18 ] some of it can also be pinpointed to a government policy of  redistribution of wealth . As a mitigating factor, the social housing policy of the current government has produced an improvement in living conditions.     Politics       Main articles:  Politics of South Africa ,  Government of South Africa , and  Law of South Africa              The  Union Buildings  in  Pretoria  is the home of the South African executive.       South Africa has three capital cities:  Cape Town , the largest of the three, is the  legislative  capital;  Pretoria  is the  administrative  capital; and  Bloemfontein  is the  judicial  capital. South Africa has a  bicameral   parliament : the  National Council of Provinces  (the  upper house ) has 90 members, while the  National Assembly  (the  lower house ) has 400 members. Members of the lower house are elected on a population basis by  proportional representation : half of the members are elected from national lists and the other half are elected from provincial lists. Ten members are elected to represent each province in the National Council of Provinces, regardless of the population of the province. Elections for both chambers are held every five years. The government is formed in the lower house, and the leader of the majority party in the National Assembly is the  President .   The primary sources of South Africa law are Roman-Dutch mercantile law and personal law with English Common law, as imports of Dutch settlements and  British colonialism . [ 19 ]  The first European based law in South Africa was brought by the  Dutch East India Company  and is called  Roman-Dutch law . It was imported before the  codification  of European law into the  Napoleonic Code  and is comparable in many ways to  Scots law . This was followed in the 19th century by  English law , both  common  and  statutory . Starting in 1910 with unification, South Africa had its own  parliament  which passed laws specific for South Africa, building on those previously passed for the individual member colonies.   Current South African politics are dominated by the  African National Congress  (ANC), which received 69.7% of the vote during the last  2004 general election  and 66.3% of the vote in the  2006 municipal election . The current  President of South Africa  is  Kgalema Motlanthe , who replaced  Thabo Mbeki  on 25 September 2008. Mbeki succeeded former President  Nelson Mandela  in 1999, and was re-elected for a second five year term in 2004, but announced his resignation on 20 September 2008.   The main challenger to the rule of the ANC is the  Democratic Alliance  party, which received 12.4% of the vote in the 2004 election and 14.8% in the 2006 election.  Helen Zille , (elected 6 May 2007), is the party leader; the previous leader was  Tony Leon . The formerly dominant  New National Party , which introduced apartheid through its predecessor, the  National Party , chose to merge with the ANC on 9 April 2005. Other major political parties represented in Parliament are the  Inkatha Freedom Party , which mainly represents  Zulu  voters, and the  Independent Democrats , who took 6.97% and 1.7% of the vote respectively, in the 2004 election.   Since 2004, the country has had many thousands of popular protests, some violent, making it, according to one academic, the ""most protest-rich country in the world"". [ 20 ]  Many of these protests have been organised from the growing  shanty towns  that surround South African cities.     Foreign relations and military       Main articles:  South African National Defence Force ,  Foreign relations of South Africa , and  South Africa and weapons of mass destruction       Since the end of apartheid, the South African foreign policy has focused on its African partners particularly in the  Southern African Development Community  (SADC) and the  African Union . South Africa has played a key role as a mediator in African conflicts over the last decade, such as in  Burundi , the  Democratic Republic of Congo , the  Comoros , and  Zimbabwe . After apartheid ended, South Africa was readmitted to the  Commonwealth of Nations . As the  Union of South Africa , South Africa was a founding member of the  United Nations  and the then Prime Minister  Jan Smuts  wrote the preamble to its constitution. South Africa is currently a non-permanent member of the  United Nations Security Council  and has attracted controversy by voting against a resolution criticising the  Burmese  government in 2006 and against the implementation of sanctions against  Zimbabwe  in 2008. South Africa is a member of the  Group of 77  and chaired the organisation in 2006. South Africa is a member of the  South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone ,  Southern African Customs Union ,  World Trade Organization ,  International Monetary Fund ,  G20  and  G8+5 .   The South African  armed forces , known as the  South African National Defence Force  (SANDF), was created in 1994. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  Previously known as the  South African Defence Force  (SADF), the new force is an all volunteer army and consists of the forces of the old SADF, as well as the forces of the African nationalist groups, namely  Umkhonto we Sizwe  (MK),  Azanian People's Liberation Army  (APLA), and the former  Bantustan  defence forces. [ 21 ]  The SANDF is subdivided into four branches, the  South African Army , the  South African Air Force , the  South African Navy , and the  South African Military Health Services . [ 23 ]   In recent years, the SANDF has become a major  peacekeeping  force in Africa, [ 24 ]  and has been involved in operations in  Lesotho , the  Democratic Republic of the Congo , [ 24 ]  and  Burundi , [ 24 ]  amongst others. It has also participated as a part of multi-national  UN  peacekeeping forces.   South Africa undertook a nuclear weapons programme in the 1970s [ 25 ]  and  may have conducted  a nuclear test over the  Atlantic  in 1979. [ 26 ]  It is the only African country to have successfully  developed nuclear weapons . It has become the first country (followed by Ukraine) with nuclear capability to voluntarily renounce and dismantle its programme and in the process signed the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty  in 1991. [ 25 ]     Provinces, districts and municipalities       Main articles:  Provinces of South Africa ,  Districts of South Africa , and  Municipalities of South Africa              Map showing the provinces and districts (numbered) of South Africa.             Northern Cape          North West          Gauteng          Limpopo          Mpumalanga            KwaZulu-Natal          Eastern Cape          Free State          Western Cape               When apartheid ended in 1994, the South African government had to integrate the formerly independent and semi-independent  Bantustans  into the political structure of South Africa. To this end, it abolished the four former provinces of South Africa ( Cape Province ,  Natal ,  Orange Free State , and  Transvaal ) and replaced them with nine fully integrated provinces. The new provinces are usually much smaller than the former provinces, which theoretically gives local governments more resources to distribute over smaller areas.   The nine provinces are further subdivided into  52 districts :  6 metropolitan  and  46 district municipalities . The 46 district municipalities are further subdivided into  231 local municipalities . The district municipalities also contain 20 district management areas (mostly game parks) that are directly governed by the district municipalities. The six metropolitan municipalities perform the functions of both district and local municipalities.

At 470,979  sq mi  (1,219,912 km), [ 27 ]  South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world (after  Mali ). It is comparable in size to  Colombia .  Njesuthi  in the  Drakensberg  at 3,408 m (11,424 ft) is the highest peak in South Africa.          View of the  Drakensberg mountains , the highest mountain range in South Africa.       South Africa has a generally  temperate climate , due in part to it being surrounded by the  Atlantic  and  Indian Oceans  on three sides, by its location in the climatically milder  southern hemisphere  and due to the average elevation rising steadily towards the north (towards the  equator ) and further inland. Due to this varied topography and oceanic influence, a great variety of climatic zones exist.   The climatic zones vary, from the extreme  desert  of the southern  Namib  in the farthest northwest to the lush  subtropical  climate in the east along the  Mozambique  border and the  Indian  ocean. From the east, the land quickly rises over a  mountainous   escarpment  towards the interior  plateau  known as the  Highveld . Even though South Africa is classified as  semi-arid , there is considerable variation in  climate  as well as  topography .   The interior of South Africa is a vast, rather flat, and sparsely populated  scrubland ,  Karoo , which is drier towards the northwest along the Namib desert. In contrast, the eastern coastline is lush and well-watered, which produces a climate similar to the tropics. The extreme southwest has a climate remarkably similar to that of the  Mediterranean  with wet winters and hot, dry summers, hosting the famous  Fynbos   Biome . This area also produces much of the  wine  in South Africa. This region is also particularly known for its wind, which blows intermittently almost all year. The severity of this wind made passing around the  Cape of Good Hope  particularly treacherous for sailors, causing many  shipwrecks . Further east on the south coast, rainfall is distributed more evenly throughout the year, producing a green landscape. This area is popularly known as the  Garden Route .          Satellite picture of South Africa       The  Free State  is particularly flat due to the fact that it lies centrally on the high plateau. North of the  Vaal River , the Highveld becomes better watered and does not experience subtropical extremes of heat.  Johannesburg , in the centre of the Highveld, is at 1,740 metres (5,709 ft) and receives an annual rainfall of 760 millimetres (30  in ). Winters in this region are cold, although  snow  is rare.   To the north of Johannesburg, the altitude drops beyond the escarpment of the Highveld, and turns into the lower lying Bushveld, an area of mixed dry forest and an abundance of wildlife. East of the Highveld, beyond the eastern escarpment, the Lowveld stretches towards the  Indian  ocean. It has particularly high temperatures, and is also the location of extended subtropical agriculture.   The high  Drakensberg mountains , which form the south-eastern escarpment of the Highveld, offer limited  skiing  opportunities in winter. The coldest place in South Africa is  Sutherland  in the western  Roggeveld Mountains , where midwinter temperatures can reach as low as 15 degrees  Celsius  (5  F ). The deep interior has the hottest temperatures: A temperature of 51.7 C (125 F) was recorded in 1948 in the  Northern Cape  Kalahari near  Upington . [ 28 ]   South Africa also has one possession, the small sub-Antarctic archipelago of the  Prince Edward Islands , consisting of  Marion Island  (290 km/112 sq mi) and Prince Edward Island (45 km/17.3 sq mi) (not to be confused with the  Canadian province of the same name ).           Weather averages for Cape Town, South Africa         Month   Jan   Feb   Mar   Apr   May   Jun   Jul   Aug   Sep   Oct   Nov   Dec   Year       Average high C (F)   27  (81)   28  (82)   26  (79)   24  (75)   20  (68)   18  (64)   17  (63)   18  (64)   19  (66)   22  (72)   24  (75)   26  (79)   28  (82)       Average low C (F)   16  (61)   16  (61)   15  (59)   13  (55)   10  (50)   8  (46)   8  (46)   8  (46)   9  (48)   11  (52)   14  (57)   15  (59)   8  (46)       Precipitation  mm (inches)   16.5  (0.65)   13  (0.51)   20  (0.79)   54  (2.13)   92  (3.62)   111  (4.37)   96  (3.78)   87  (3.43)   56  (2.2)   40  (1.57)   24  (0.94)   18  (0.71)   627  (24.69)       Source: EuroWEATHER [ 29 ]  2008-02-22         Flora and fauna     See also:  Wildlife of South Africa   See also:  Protected areas of South Africa             Fynbos , a  floral kingdom  unique to South Africa, is found near  Cape Town               Swartberg  mountains near the town of  Oudtshoorn              A field of flowers in Weskus National Park.       South Africa is one of only 17 countries worldwide considered  megadiverse . It has more than 20,000 different  plants , or about 10% of all the known  species  of plants on  Earth , making it particularly rich in plant biodiversity. South Africa is the 6th most biodiverse country, [ 30 ]  after  Brazil ,  Colombia ,  Indonesia ,  China , and  Mexico . The most prevalent biome in South Africa is the  grassland , particularly on the  Highveld , where the plant cover is dominated by different  grasses , low  shrubs , and  acacia trees , mainly camel-thorn and whitethorn.  Vegetation  becomes even more sparse towards the northwest due to low  rainfall . There are several species of water-storing  succulents  like  aloes  and euphorbias in the very hot and dry  Namaqualand  area. The grass and thorn  savannah  turns slowly into a bush savannah towards the north-east of the country, with denser growth. There are significant numbers of  baobab  trees in this area, near the northern end of  Kruger National Park . [ 31 ]   The  Fynbos   Biome , which makes up the majority of the area and plant life in the  Cape floristic region , one of the six  floral kingdoms , is located in a small region of the  Western Cape  and contains more than 9,000 of those species, making it among the richest regions on earth in terms of floral biodiversity. The majority of the plants are  evergreen  hard-leaf plants with fine, needle-like  leaves , such as the  sclerophyllous  plants. Another uniquely South African plant is the  protea  genus of flowering plants. There are around 130 different species of protea in South Africa.   While South Africa has a great wealth of flowering plants, it has few  forests . Only 1% of South Africa is forest, almost exclusively in the  humid   coastal plain  along the  Indian Ocean  in  KwaZulu-Natal  (see  KwaZulu-Cape coastal forest mosaic ). There are even smaller reserves of forests that are out of the reach of  fire , known as montane forests (see  Knysna-Amatole montane forests ).  Plantations  of imported tree species are predominant, particularly the non-native  eucalyptus  and  pine . South Africa has lost a large area of natural habitat in the last four decades, primarily due to  overpopulation , sprawling development patterns and  deforestation  during the nineteenth century. South Africa is one of the worst affected countries in the world when it comes to invasion by alien species with many (e.g.  Black Wattle ,  Port Jackson ,  Hakea ,  Lantana  and  Jacaranda ) posing a significant threat to the native  biodiversity  and the already scarce water resources. The original  temperate forest  that met the first European settlers to South Africa was exploited ruthlessly until only small patches remained. Currently, South African  hardwood  trees like  Real Yellowwood   (Podocarpus latifolius) ,  stinkwood   (Ocotea bullata) , and South African  Black Ironwood   (Olea laurifolia)  are under government protection.   Numerous  mammals  are found in the  bushveld  habitats including  lions ,  leopards ,  white rhinos ,  blue wildebeest ,  kudus ,  impalas ,  hyenas ,  hippopotamus  and  giraffes . A significant extent of the bushveld habitat exists in the north-east including  Kruger National Park  and the  Mala Mala  Reserve, as well as in the far north in the  Waterberg Biosphere .   Climate change is expected to bring considerable warming and drying to much of this already semi-arid region, with greater frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, flooding and drought. According to computer generated climate modelling produced by the South African National Biodiversity Institute [ 32 ]  parts of southern Africa will see an increase in temperature by about one degree Celsius along the coast to more than four degrees Celsius in the already hot hinterland such as the  Northern Cape  in late spring and summertime by 2050.   The Cape Floral Kingdom has been identified as one of the global  biodiversity hotspots  since it will be hit very hard by  climate change  and has such a great diversity of life. Drought, increased intensity and frequency of fire and climbing temperatures are expected to push many of these  rare species  towards  extinction .   South Africa houses many endemic species, among them the  critically endangered   Riverine Rabbit  ( Bunolagus monticullaris ) in the  Karoo .     Economy       Main article:  Economy of South Africa              The  Victoria & Alfred Waterfront  in  Cape Town  with  Table Mountain  in the background. Cape Town has become an important  retail  and  tourism  centre for the country, and attracts the largest number of foreign visitors in South Africa       By  UN  classification South Africa is a middle-income country with an abundant supply of resources, well-developed financial, legal, communications, energy, and transport sectors, a  stock exchange  (the  JSE Limited ), that ranks among the top twenty in the world, and a modern infrastructure supporting an efficient distribution of goods to major urban centres throughout the entire region. South Africa is ranked 25th in the world in terms of  GDP  (PPP) as of 2007.   Advanced development is significantly localised around four areas: Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Durban, and Pretoria/Johannesburg. Beyond these four economic centres, development is marginal and poverty is still prevalent despite government efforts. Consequently the vast majority of South Africans are poor. However, key marginal areas have experienced rapid growth recently. Such areas include Mossel Bay to Plettenberg Bay; Rustenburg area; Nelspruit area; Bloemfontein; Cape West Coast; and the KwaZulu-Natal North Coast.   Even though South Africa has the seventh highest per capita income in Africa, only behind  Libya ,  Mauritius  it suffers from large income gaps and a  dual economy  marking it as a  developing country . South Africa has one of the highest rates of  income inequality  in the world. A decade of continual economic growth has helped to lower unemployment, but daunting economic and social problems remain. The average South African household income decreased considerably between 1995 and 2000. As for racial inequality,  Statistics South Africa  reported that in 1995 the average white household earned four times as much as the average black household. In 2000 the average white household was earning six times more than the average black household. [ 33 ]  The  affirmative action  policies have seen a rise in black economic wealth and an emerging black middle class. [ 34 ]  Other problems are crime, corruption, and  HIV / AIDS .   At the start of 2000, then President Thabo Mbeki vowed to promote economic growth and foreign investment by relaxing restrictive labour laws, stepping up the pace of  privatisation , and cutting unneeded governmental spending. His policies face strong opposition from organised  labour . South Africa is also the largest energy producer and consumer on the continent. South Africa is a popular tourist destination, and a substantial amount of revenue comes from tourism. [ 35 ]  Among the main attractions are the diverse and picturesque culture, the game reserves and the highly regarded local wines.   The South African  rand  (ZAR), is the most actively traded emerging  market currency  in the world. It has joined an elite club of fifteen currencies, the  Continuous linked settlement  (CLS), where forex transactions are settled immediately, lowering the risks of transacting across  time zones . The rand was the best-performing currency against the  United States dollar  (USD) between 2002 and 2005, according to the  Bloomberg  Currency Scorecard.   The volatility of the  rand  has affected economic activity, falling sharply during 2001 and hitting a historic low of 13.85  ZAR  to the  USD , raising fears of inflation, and causing the Reserve Bank to increase  interest rates . The rand has since recovered, trading at 7.13 ZAR to the dollar as of January 2008. However, as exporters are put under considerable pressure from a stronger domestic currency, many call for government intervention to help soften the rand.   Refugees from poorer neighbouring countries include many immigrants from the DRC, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Malawi and others, representing a large portion of the informal sector. With high unemployment levels amongst poorer South Africans,  xenophobia  is prevalent and many people born in South Africa feel resentful of immigrants who are seen to be depriving the native population of jobs, a feeling which has been given credibility by the fact that many South African employers have employed migrants from other countries for lower pay than South African citizens, especially in the  construction ,  tourism ,  agriculture  and  domestic service  industries. Illegal immigrants are also heavily involved in informal trading. [ 36 ]  However, many immigrants to South Africa continue to live in poor conditions, and the South African immigration policy has become increasingly restrictive since 1994. [ 37 ]   Principal international trading partners of South Africa  besides other African countries  include  Germany ,  Japan ,  Switzerland , the  United Kingdom , and the  United States . Chief exports include  corn ,  diamonds ,  fruits ,  gold ,  metals  and  minerals ,  sugar , and  wool .  Machinery  and transportation equipment make up more than one-third of the value of the countrys imports. Other imports include  chemicals , manufactured goods, and  petroleum .     Electricity crisis   After unsuccessful attempts by the government to encourage private construction of electricity generation capacity, in 2007 the state-owned electricity supplier ( Eskom ) started experiencing a lack of capacity in the electrical generating and reticulation infrastructure. This led to an inability to meet the routine demands of industry and consumers, resulting in countrywide  rolling blackouts . Initially the lack of capacity was triggered by a failure at  Koeberg nuclear power station , but since then a general lack of capacity became evident. The supplier has been widely criticised for failing to adequately plan for and construct sufficient electrical generating capacity, [ 38 ]  although ultimately the government has admitted that it is at fault for refusing to approve funding for investment in infrastructure. [ 39 ]     Agriculture          Workers planting on a farm in the central area of  Mpumalanga .               Farm  workers.       South Africa has a large agricultural sector and is a net exporter of  farming  products. There are almost a thousand  agricultural cooperatives  and  agribusinesses  throughout the country, and agricultural exports have constituted 8% of South African total exports for the past five years. The agricultural industry contributes around 10% of formal employment, relatively low compared to other parts of Africa, as well as providing work for casual labourers and contributing around 2.6% of  GDP  for the nation. [ 40 ]  However, due to the  aridity  of the land, only 13.5% can be used for crop production, and only 3% is considered high potential land. [ 41 ]   Although the commercial farming sector is relatively well developed, people in some rural areas still survive on  subsistence agriculture . It is the eighth largest wine producer in the world, and the eleventh largest producer of sunflower seed. South Africa is a net exporter of agricultural products and foodstuffs, the largest number of exported items being  sugar ,  grapes ,  citrus ,  nectarines ,  wine  and  deciduous  fruit. The largest locally produced crop is  maize  (corn), and it has been estimated that 9 million tons are produced every year, with 7.4 million tons being consumed.  Livestock  are also popular on South African farms, with the country producing 85% of all meat consumed. The dairy industry consists of around 4,300 milk producers providing employment for 60,000 farm workers and contributing to the livelihoods of around 40,000 others. [ 42 ]   In recent years, the agricultural sector has introduced several reforms, some of which are controversial, such as  land reform  and the deregulation of the market for agricultural products. Land reform has been criticised both by farmers' groups and by landless workers, the latter alleging that the pace of change has not been fast enough, and the former alleging racist treatment and expressing concerns that a similar situation to  Zimbabwe's land reform policy  may develop, [ 43 ]  a fear exacerbated by comments made by  deputy president , the deputy president of South Africa. [ 44 ] [ 45 ]  The sector continues to face problems, with increased foreign competition and crime being two of the major challenges for the industry. The government has been accused of either putting in too much effort [ 46 ] , or not enough effort [ 47 ] , to tackle the problem of  farm attacks  as opposed to other forms of violent crime.   Another issue which affects South African agriculture is environmental damage caused by misuse of the land and global climate change. South Africa is unusually vulnerable to climate change and resultant diminution of surface waters. Some predictions show surface water supply could decrease by 60% by the year 2070 in parts of the Western Cape. [ 48 ]  To reverse the damage caused by land mismanagement, the government has supported a scheme which promotes  sustainable development  and the use of natural resources. [ 49 ]  Maize production, which contributes to a 36% majority of the gross value of South Africas field crops, has also experienced negative effects due to climate change. The estimated value of loss, which takes into consideration scenarios with and without the carbon dioxide fertilization effect [2]  ,ranges between 10s to 100s of millions of Rands.

South Africa is a nation of more than 48 million people of diverse origins,  cultures ,  languages , and  religions . The last  census  was held in 2001 and the next will be in 2011.  Statistics South Africa  provided five  racial  categories by which people could classify themselves, the last of which, ""unspecified/other"" drew negligible responses, and these results were omitted. [ 51 ]  The 2006 midyear estimated figures for the other categories were  Black African  at 79.5%,  White  at 9.2%,  Coloured  at 8.9%, and  Indian or Asian  at 2.5%. [ 52 ]  Even though the population of South Africa has increased in the past decade [ 51 ] [ 53 ]  (primarily due to immigration), the country had an annual population growth rate of 0.501% in 2008 (CIA est.), including immigration. [ 54 ]  South Africa is home to an estimated 5 million  illegal immigrants , including some 3 million  Zimbabweans . [ 55 ] [ 56 ] [ 57 ]  A series of  anti-immigrant riots  occurred in South Africa beginning on 11 May 2008. [ 58 ] [ 59 ]   By far the major part of the population classified itself as African or black, but it is not culturally or linguistically homogeneous. Major ethnic groups include the  Zulu ,  Xhosa ,  Basotho  (South Sotho),  Bapedi  (North Sotho),  Venda ,  Tswana ,  Tsonga ,  Swazi  and  Ndebele , all of which speak  Bantu languages  (see  Bantu peoples of South Africa ).   Some, such as the Zulu, Xhosa, Bapedi and Venda groups, are unique to South Africa. Other groups are distributed across the borders with neighbours of South Africa: The  Basotho  group is also the major ethnic group in  Lesotho . The  Tswana  ethnic group constitute the majority of the population of  Botswana . The  Swazi  ethnic group is the major ethnic group in  Swaziland . The  Ndebele  ethnic group is also found in  Matabeleland  in  Zimbabwe , where they are known as the  Matabele . These Ndebele people are the descendants of a Zulu faction under the warrior  Mzilikazi  that escaped persecution from  Shaka  by migrating to their current territory. The  Tsonga  ethnic group is also found in southern  Mozambique , where they are known as the Shangaan.   The white population is not ethnically homogenous and descend from many ethnic groups:  Dutch ,  Flemish ,  Portuguese , German, French  Huguenot , English, Irish, Italian, Scottish and  Welsh . Culturally and linguistically, they are divided into the  Afrikaners , who speak  Afrikaans , and English-speaking groups, many of whom are descended from British and Irish immigrants (see  Anglo-African ). Many small communities that have immigrated over the last century retain the use of other languages. The  white population  is on the decrease due to a low birth rate and emigration; as a factor in their decision to emigrate, many cite the high  crime  rate and the  affirmative action  policies of the government. Since 1994, approximately 1 000 000 white South Africans have permanently emigrated. [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ] [ 63 ]  Despite high emigration levels, a high level of non-South African white immigrants have settled in the country, in particular from countries such as  Britain  and  Zimbabwe . For example, by 2005, an estimated 212 000 British citizens were residing in South Africa. Since 2003, the numbers of British migrants coming to South Africa has risen by 50%. An estimated 20 000 British migrants moved to South Africa in 2007. There have also been a significant number of  white Zimbabwean  arrivals, fleeing their home country in light of the economic and political problems currently facing the country. As well as recent arrivals, a significant number of white Zimbabweans emigrated to South Africa in the wake of independence in Zimbabwe in 1980. Some of the more nostalgic members of the community are known in popular culture as "" Whenwes "", because of their nostalgia for their lives in  Rhodesia  ""when we were in Rhodesia"". [ 64 ]   The term  Coloured  is still largely used for the people of mixed race descended from slaves brought in from East and Central Africa, the indigenous  Khoisan  who lived in the  Cape  at the time, Bantus, Whites (mostly the  Dutch / Afrikaner  and British settlers) as well as an admixture of  Javanese ,  Malay , Indian,  Malagasy  and Asian blood (such as  Burmese ). The majority speak Afrikaans. Khoisan is a term used to describe two separate groups, physically similar: light-skinned and small in stature. The  Khoikhoi , who were called  Hottentots  by the Europeans, were pastoralists and were annihilated; the San, called  Bushmen  by the Europeans, were hunter-gatherers. Within the Coloured community, more recent immigrants will also be found: Coloureds from the former  Rhodesia  (now  Zimbabwe );  Namibia  and immigrants of mixed descent from India and  Burma  ( Anglo-Indians / Anglo-Burmese ) who were welcomed to the Cape when India and Burma received their Independence.   The major part of the South African  Asian  population is Indian in origin (see  Indian South Africans ); many of them descended from indentured workers brought in the nineteenth century to work on the  sugar   plantations  of the eastern coastal area then known as  Natal . There is also a significant group of  Chinese South Africans  (approximately 100,000 individuals) and  Vietnamese  South Africans (approximately 50,000 individuals). In 2008, the Pretoria High Court has ruled that Chinese South Africans who arrived before 1994 are to be reclassified as  Coloureds . As a result of this ruling, about 12,000 - 15,000  [ 65 ] ethnically Chinese citizens who arrived before 1994, numbering 3%-5% of the total Chinese population in the country, will be able to benefit from government  BEE  policies. [ 66 ]   South Africa hosts a sizeable refugee and asylum seeker population. According to the  World Refugee Survey 2008 , published by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, this population numbered approximately 144,700 in 2007. [ 67 ]  Groups of refugees and asylum seekers numbering over 10,000 included people from  Zimbabwe  (48,400), The  Democratic Republic of the Congo  (24,800), and  Somalia  (12,900). [ 67 ]  These populations mainly lived in Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban, Cape Town, and Port Elizabeth. [ 67 ]     Science and technology   Several important scientific and technological developments have originated in South Africa.  The first human to human heart transplant was performed by cardiac surgeon  Christiaan Barnard  at  Groote Schuur Hospital  in December 1967  .  Max Theiler  developed a vaccine against Yellow Fever,  Allan McLeod Cormack  pioneered x-ray  Computed tomography , and  Aaron Klug  developed crystallographic electron microscopy techniques. These advancements were all recognized with  Nobel Prizes .  Sydney Brenner  won most recently, in 2002, for his pioneering work in  molecular biology .   Mark Shuttleworth  founded an early Internet security company  Thawte , that was subsequently bought out by world-leader  VeriSign . Despite government efforts to encourage entrepreneurship in biotechnology, IT and other high technology fields, no other notable groundbreaking companies have been founded in South Africa. However, it is the expressed objective of the government to transition the economy to be more reliant on high technology, based on the realization that South African cannot compete with Far Eastern economies in manufacturing, nor can the republic rely on its mineral wealth in perpetuity.   South Africa has cultivated a burgeoning astronomy community. It hosts the  Southern African Large Telescope , the largest optical telescope in the southern hemisphere. South Africa is currently building the  Karoo Array Telescope  as a pathfinder for the $20 billion  Square Kilometer Array  project. South Africa is a finalist, with Australia, to be the host of the SKA.     Society and culture       Main article:  Culture of South Africa              Decorated houses,  Drakensberg Mountains              Traditional  South African cuisine .       It may be argued that there is no ""single"" culture in South Africa because of its ethnic diversity. Today, the diversity in foods from many cultures is enjoyed by all and especially marketed to tourists who wish to sample the large variety of South African cuisine. In addition to  food ,  music  and  dance  feature prominently.   South African cuisine  is heavily  meat-based  and has spawned the distinctively South African social gathering known as a  braai , or barbecue. South Africa has also developed into a major  wine  producer, with some of the best  vineyards  lying in valleys around  Stellenbosch ,  Franschoek ,  Paarl  and  Barrydale . [ 68 ]   There is great diversity in music from South Africa. Many black musicians who sang in Afrikaans or English during apartheid have since begun to sing in traditional African languages, and have developed a unique style called  Kwaito . Of note is  Brenda Fassie , who launched to fame with her song ""Weekend Special"", which was sung in English. More famous traditional musicians include  Ladysmith Black Mambazo , while the  Soweto String Quartet  performs classic music with an African flavour. White and Coloured South African singers are historically influenced by European musical styles including such western metal bands such as  Seether  (formerly Saron Gas). South Africa has produced world-famous jazz musicians, notably  Hugh Masekela ,  Jonas Gwangwa ,  Abdullah Ibrahim ,  Miriam Makeba ,  Jonathan Butler ,  Chris McGregor , and  Sathima Bea Benjamin .  Afrikaans  music covers multiple genres, such as the  contemporary   Steve Hofmeyr  and the  punk rock  band  Fokofpolisiekar . Crossover artists such as  Johnny Clegg  and his bands  Juluka  and  Savuka  have enjoyed various success underground, publicly, and abroad.   The South African black majority still has a substantial number of rural inhabitants who lead largely impoverished lives. It is among these people, however, that cultural traditions survive most strongly; as blacks have become increasingly  urbanised  and  westernised , aspects of traditional culture have declined. Urban blacks usually speak English or  Afrikaans  in addition to their native tongue. There are smaller but still significant groups of speakers of  Khoisan languages  who are not included in the eleven official languages, but are one of the eight other officially recognised languages. There are small groups of speakers of  endangered languages , most of which are from the Khoi-San family, that receive no official status; however, some groups within South Africa are attempting to promote their use and revival.   The  middle class  lifestyle, predominantly of the white minority but with growing numbers of Black, Coloured and Indian people, [ 69 ]  is similar in many respects to that of people found in  Western Europe , North America and  Australasia . Members of the middle class often study and work abroad for greater exposure to the markets of the world.   Asians , predominantly of Indian origin, preserve their own cultural heritage, languages and religious beliefs, being either  Christian ,  Hindu  or  Sunni Muslim  and speaking English, with Indian languages like  Hindi ,  Telugu ,  Tamil  or  Gujarati  being spoken less frequently, but the majority of Indians being able to understand their mother tongue. The first Indians arrived on the famous  Truro ship  as  indentured labourers  in Natal to work the Sugar Cane Fields. There is a much smaller  Chinese  community in South Africa, although its numbers have increased due to immigration from  Republic of China  (Taiwan).   South Africa has also had a large influence in the  Scouting  movement, with many Scouting traditions and ceremonies coming from the experiences of  Robert Baden-Powell  (the founder of Scouting) during his time in South Africa as a military officer in the 1890s. The  South African Scout Association  was one of the first youth organisations to open its doors to youth and adults of all races in South Africa. This happened on 2 July 1977 at a conference known as  Quo Vadis . [ 70 ]   The South African music scene consists of  Kwaito , a new music genre that had developed in the mid 80s and has since developed to become the most popular social economical form of representation among the populous. Though some may argue that the political aspects of Kwaito has since diminished after  Apartheid , and the relative interest in politics has become a minor aspect of daily life. Some argue that in a sense,  Kwaito  is in fact a political force that shows activism in its apolitical actions. Today, major corporations like  Sony ,  BMG , and  EMI  have appeared on the South African scene to produce and distribute  Kwaito  music. Due to its overwhelming popularity, as well as the general influence of DJs, who are among the top 5 most influential types of people within the country,  Kwaito  has taken over radio, television, and magazines. [ 71 ]   Kwaito , much like most hip-hop has its own local flavor and originality. However, unlike when hip-hop first burst on the scene as a politically driven and rebellious underground movement, South Africans wanted to create a happier vibe. As the post-apartheid fog cleared, South African youth found their ""own voice in a style of music known as kwaito, spawning a new (and profitable) industry"". [ 72 ]  According to TIMEeurope magazine, ""The kwaito sound now regularly incorporates traditional African music, jazz, gospel, and even rock guitar, most notably on Mandoza's 2000 hit Nkalakatha, one of the few kwaito records to cross over onto traditionally white radio"". [ 73 ]  In the kwaito, the samples from old school  Jamaican dancehall , European house, etc.,  tempos  are changed, beats are added, and urban street slang is also incorporated. This local flavor of music more recently has been attacked for its lack of ingenuity and its betrayal of its roots. The melodies and the incorporation of sex and dance have since become very similar to the American standard. In addition Kwaito has been criticised for its absence of influential lyrical content. As Kwaito is still a developing genre, and since the South African population is only around 48 million, sales of only 25,000 CDs are required for ""gold"" certification in South Africa. [ 72 ]     Religion       Main article:  Religion in South Africa               St. Mark 's Anglican Cathedral.       According to the latest 2001 national census, Christians accounted for 79.7% of the population. This includes  Zion Christian  11.1%,  Pentecostal  ( Charismatic ) 8.2%,  Roman Catholic  7.1%,  Methodist  6.8%,  Dutch Reformed  6.7%,  Anglican  3.8%, and other Christian 36%.  Islam  accounted for 1.5% of the population,  Hinduism  about 1.3%, and  Judaism  0.2%. 15.1% had no religious affiliation, 2.3% were other and 1.4% were unspecified. [ 74 ] [ 75 ]   African Indigenous Churches were the largest of the  Christian  groups. It was believed that many of these persons who claimed no affiliation with any organised religion adhered to  traditional indigenous religions . Many peoples have  syncretic  religious practices combining Christian and indigenous influences. [ 76 ]   Islam in South Africa  itself is not known to pre-date the colonial period, despite the isolated contact neighbouring  Mozambique  had with  Arab  and  East African  traders. [ citation needed ]  There is no evidence that Islam was known to the  Zulu ,  Swazi , or  Xhosa  of the east coast prior to the colonial era. Many South African Muslims are described as  Coloureds , notably in the  Western Cape , especially those whose ancestors came as slaves from the Indonesian archipelago (the  Cape Malays ). Others are described as  Indians , notably in  KwaZulu-Natal , including those whose ancestors came as traders from  South Asia ; they have been joined by others from other parts of Africa as well as white or black South African converts. It is estimated that  Islam  is the fastest growing religion of conversion in the country, [ 77 ]  with the number of black  Muslims  growing sixfold, from 12,000 in 1991 to 74,700 in 2004. [ 78 ]   Hinduism  dates back to British Colonial period primarily but later waves of continuous immigrants from India have contributed to a sizable Hindu population. Most Hindus are ethnically South Asian but there are many who come from mixed racial stock and many are converts with the efforts of Hindu missionaries such as ISKCON. Other religions in smaller numbers are  Sikhism ,  Jainism  and  Bah' Faith . [ 75 ]     Languages       Main article:  Languages of South Africa              Map showing principal South African languages by municipality. Lighter shades indicate a non-majority  plurality .             Afrikaans          Northern Sotho          Southern Sotho          Swati          Tsonga            Tswana          Venda          Xhosa          Zulu               South Africa has eleven  official languages : [ 79 ]   Sepedi ,  Sesotho ,  Setswana ,  siSwati ,  Tshivenda ,  Xitsonga ,  Afrikaans ,  English ,  isiNdebele ,  isiXhosa  and  isiZulu . In this regard it is  second only to India  in number. While each language is formally equal to every other, some languages are spoken more than others. According to the 2001 National Census, the three most spoken first home languages are Zulu (23.8%), Xhosa (17.6%) and Afrikaans (13.3%). [ 51 ]  Despite the fact that English is recognised as the language of commerce and science, it was spoken by only 8.2% of South Africans at home in 2001, an even lower percentage than in 1996 (8.6%). [ 51 ]   There are  eleven official names  for South Africa, one in each of the official national languages. The country also recognises eight non-official languages:  Fanagalo ,  Khoe ,  Lobedu ,  Nama ,  Northern Ndebele ,  Phuthi ,  San  and  South African Sign Language . [ citation needed ]  These non-official languages may be used in certain official uses in limited areas where it has been determined that these languages are prevalent. Nevertheless, their populations are not such that they require nationwide recognition.   Many of the ""unofficial languages"" of the  San  and  Khoikhoi  people contain regional  dialects  stretching northward into Namibia and Botswana, and elsewhere. These people, who are a physically distinct population from other Africans, have their own cultural identity based on their  hunter-gatherer  societies. They have been marginalised to a great extent, and many of their languages are in danger of becoming  extinct .   Many white South Africans also speak other European languages, such as  Portuguese  (also spoken by Angolan and Mozambican blacks), German, and  Greek , while some  Asians  and  Indians  in South Africa speak  South Asian  languages, such as  Tamil ,  Hindi ,  Gujarati ,  Urdu  and  Telugu .  French  is still widely spoken by French South Africans especially in places like  Franschhoek , where many South Africans are of French origin. South African French is spoken by less than 10,000 individuals. Congolese French is also spoken in South Africa by migrants.

In 2004, the swim team of  Roland Schoeman ,  Lyndon Ferns ,  Darian Townsend  and  Ryk Neethling  won the gold medal at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, simultaneously breaking the world record in the 4x100 freestyle relay.  Penny Heyns  won Olympic Gold in the 1996  Atlanta Olympic Games .   In golf,  Gary Player  is generally regarded as one of the greatest golfers of all time, having won the  Career Grand Slam , one of five golfers to have done so. Other South African golfers to have successfully won a major tournament include  Bobby Locke ,  Ernie Els ,  Retief Goosen  and  Trevor Immelman .     Current issues     HIV/AIDS       Main article:  HIV/AIDS in South Africa       The spread of  AIDS  (acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome) is an alarming problem in South Africa with up to 31% of pregnant women found to be HIV infected in 2005 and the infection rate among adults estimated at 20%. [ 80 ]  The link between HIV, a virus spread primarily by sexual contact, and AIDS was long denied by prior president  Thabo Mbeki  and then health minister  Manto Tshabalala-Msimang , who insisted that the many deaths in the country are due to malnutrition, and hence poverty, and not HIV. [ 81 ]  In 2007, in response to international pressure, the government made efforts to fight AIDS. [ 82 ]  In September 2008 Thabo Mbeki was ousted by the ANC and  Kgalema Motlanthe  was appointed for the interim. One of Mr. Motlanthe's first actions was to replace Mrs. Tshabalala-Msimang with the current minister,  Barbara Hogan .   AIDS affects mainly those who are sexually active and is far more prevalent in the black population. Most deaths are people who are also economically active, resulting in many families losing their primary wage earners. This has resulted in many 'AIDS orphans' who in many cases depend on the state for care and financial support. [ 83 ]  It is estimated that there are 1,200,000 orphans in South Africa. [ 83 ]  Many elderly people also lose the support from lost younger members of their family. Roughly 5 million people are infected with the disease. [ 82 ]     Crime       Main article:  Crime in South Africa               Prison  buildings on  Robben Island       According to a survey for the period 19982000 compiled by the  United Nations , South Africa was ranked second for  murder  and first for  assaults  and  rapes  per capita. [ 84 ]  Total crime per capita is 10th out of the 60 countries in the data set.   Crime  has had a pronounced effect on society: many middle-class South Africans moved into  gated communities , abandoning the central business districts of some cities for the relative security of suburbs. This effect is most pronounced in  Johannesburg , although the trend is noticeable in other cities as well. [ citation needed ]  Many emigrants from South Africa also state that crime was a big motivator for them to leave.  Crime against the farming community  has continued to be a major problem. [ 85 ]     Skills migration   Along with many African nations, South Africa has been experiencing a "" brain drain "" in the past 20 years. This is believed to be potentially damaging for the regional economy, [ 86 ]  and is almost certainly detrimental for the well-being of the majority of people reliant on the healthcare infrastructure, given the HIV/AIDS epidemic. [ 87 ]  The skills drain in South Africa tends to demonstrate racial contours (naturally given the skills distribution legacy of South Africa) and has thus resulted in large white South African communities abroad. [ 88 ]     Xenophobia       Main article:  Xenophobia in South Africa       In May 2008 long standing state hostility to African migrants exploded in a series of pogroms that left up to 100 people dead and 100,000 displaced.

Located at roughly 13 North of the  equator  and 59 West of the  prime meridian , it is considered a part of the  Lesser Antilles . Its closest island neighbours are  Saint Vincent & the Grenadines  and  Saint Lucia  to the west. To the south lies  Trinidad and Tobago with which Barbados now shares a fixed official maritime boundaryand also the  South American  mainland. Barbados's total land area is about 430 square kilometres (166 square miles), and is primarily low-lying, with some higher in the country's interior. The highest point in Barbados is  Mount Hillaby  in the parish of Saint Andrew. The geological composition of Barbados is of non-volcanic origin and is predominantly composed of  limestone - coral  formed by subduction of the South American plate colliding with the Caribbean plate. The island's climate is  tropical , with constant  trade winds  off the Atlantic Ocean serving to keep temperatures mild. Some less developed areas of the country contain tropical woodland and  mangroves . Other parts of the interior which contribute to the agriculture industry are dotted with large  sugarcane  estates and wide, gently sloping  pastures , with panoramic views down to the coast also.   Barbados's  human development index  ranking is consistently among the top 75 countries in the world. For example, in 2006, it was ranked 31st in the world, and third in the Americas, behind  Canada  and the  United States .

The origin of the name ""Barbados"" is controversial. The  Portuguese , en route to  Brazil  are credited as the first Europeans to discover and name the island. It is a matter of conjecture whether the word ""bearded"" refers to the long, hanging roots of the bearded fig-tree ( Ficus citrifolia ), indigenous to the island, to bearded  Caribs  inhabiting the island, or to the foam spraying over the outlying reefs giving the impression of a beard. In 1519, a map produced by the Genoese mapmaker  Visconte Maggiolo  showed and named Barbados in its correct position southeast of the island of  Dominica .   Another name associated with Barbados or her people is ""Bim"" or ""Bimshire"". The origin is uncertain but several theories abound, the  National Cultural Foundation  of Barbados follows the Dr.  Richard Allsopp  theory, which is that ""Bim"" was a word commonly used by slaves and that it derives from the phrase ""bi mu"" [ 3 ]  or either (""bem"", ""Ndi bem"", ""Nwanyi ibem"" or ""Nwoke ibem"") [ 4 ]  from an  Igbo  phrase, meaning ""my people."" In colloquial or literary contexts, ""Bim"" can also take a more deific tone, referring to the ""goddess"" Barbados. [ citation needed ]  The word Bim and Bimshire are recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary and the Chamber's Twentieth Century Dictionaries. Another possible source for ""Bim"" is reported to be in the Agricultural Reporter of 25 April 1868, The Rev. N Greenidge (father of one of the island's most famous scholars, Abel Hendy Jones Greenidge) suggested the listing of Bimshire as a county of England. Expressly named were ""Wiltshire, Hampshire, Berkshire, and Bimshire"". [ 5 ]  Lastly in the Daily Argosy (of Demerara i.e. Guyana) of 1652 it referred to Bim as a possible corruption of the word "" Byam "", who was a Royalist leader against the Parliamentarians. That source suggested the followers of Byam became known as Bims and became a word for all Barbadians. [ 6 ]     [ edit ]   Early history   The first indigenous people are thought to be  Amerindians  who arrived from  Venezuela  around approximately 350-400 B.C. The  Arawak  people were the second wave of migrants, arriving from South America around 800. In the thirteenth century, the Caribs arrived from South America in the third wave, displacing both the Arawak and the Salodoid-Barrancoid culture. For the next few centuries, the Caribs  like the Arawak and the Salodoid-Barrancoid  lived in isolation on the island.   The  Portuguese  then briefly claimed Barbados from the mid-1500s to the 1600s; and may have seized the indigenous  Caribs  on Barbados and used them as  slave labour . Other Caribs are believed to have fled the island to neighbouring islands. Apart from possibly displacing the Caribs, the Portuguese left little impact and by the 1610s, they left for South America, leaving the island uninhabited.     [ edit ]   British colonial rule   British sailors who landed on Barbados in 1625 arrived at the site of present-day  Holetown . From the arrival of the first British settlers in 16271628 until independence in 1966, Barbados was under uninterrupted British control. Nevertheless, Barbados always enjoyed a large measure of local autonomy. Its  House of Assembly  began meeting in 1639. Among the initial important British figures was Sir  William Courten .   With the increased implementation of slave codes, which created differential treatment between Africans and the white workers and planters, the island became increasingly unattractive to  poor whites . Black or slave codes were implemented in 1661, 1676, 1682, and 1688. In response to these codes, several slave rebellions were attempted or planned during this time, but none succeeded. However, an increasingly repressive legal system caused the gap between the treatment of typically white indentured servants and black slaves to widen. Imported slaves became much more attractive for the rich planters who would increasingly dominate the island not only economically but also politically. Some have speculated that, because the Africans could withstand tropical diseases and the climate much better than the white slave population, the white population decreased. This is inconsistent with the fact that many poor whites simply migrated to neighbouring islands and remained in tropical climates. Nevertheless, poor whites who had or acquired the means to emigrate often did so. Planters expanded their importation of African slaves to cultivate sugar cane. The Barbados turned from mainly English and Scots-Irish in the seventeenth century to overwhelmingly black by the end of the 18th century.   Barbados eventually had one of the world's biggest sugar industries after Jews from Brazil introduced the sugarcane to the island in the mid 1600s. This quickly replaced  tobacco  plantations on the islands which were previously the main export. As the  sugar  industry developed into its main commercial enterprise, Barbados was divided into large plantation estates that replaced the smallholdings of the early British settlers. Some of the displaced farmers moved to other British colonies in the Americas, most notably  North  and  South Carolina , and  British Guiana , as well as  Panama . To work the plantations, planters imported enslaved West Africans to Barbados and other Caribbean islands.   The British abolished the  slave trade  in 1807 but not the institution itself. In 1816, slaves arose in the largest major slave rebellion in the island's history. Twenty thousand slaves from over seventy plantations rebelled. They drove whites off the plantations, but widespread killings did not take place. This was later termed Bussa's Rebellion after the slave ranger Bussa, who with his assistants hated slavery, found the treatment of slaves on Barbados to be intolerable, and believed the political climate in the UK made the time ripe to peacefully negotiate with planters for freedom (Davis, p. 211; Northrup, p. 191). Bussa's Rebellion failed. One hundred and twenty slaves died in combat or were immediately executed; another 144 were brought to trial and executed; remaining rebels were shipped off the island (Davis, pp. 212-213).   Slavery was finally abolished in the British Empire eighteen years later in 1834. In Barbados and the rest of the British West Indian colonies, full emancipation from slavery was preceded by an apprenticeship period that lasted four years.          Statue of  Lord Nelson  in  National Heroes Square  which predates the more famous  Nelson's Column  by some 27 years.       In 1884, the Barbados Agricultural Society sent a letter to  Sir Francis Hincks  requesting his private and public views on whether the Dominion of Canada would favourably entertain having the then colony of Barbados admitted as a member of the Canadian Confederation. Asked of  Canada  were the terms of the Canadian side to initiate discussions, and whether or not the island of Barbados could depend on the full influence of Canada in getting the change agreed to by the  United Kingdom . Then in 1952 the  Barbados Advocate  newspaper polled several prominent Barbadian politicians, lawyers, businessmen, the Speaker of the  Barbados House of Assembly  and later as first President of the  Senate , Sir Theodore Branker , Q.C. and found them to be in favour of immediate federation of Barbados along with the rest of the British  Caribbean  with complete Dominion Status within five years from the date of inauguration of the  West Indies Federation  with Canada.   However, plantation owners and merchants of British descent still dominated local politics, owing to the high income qualification required for voting. More than 70% of the population, many of them disenfranchised women, were excluded from the democratic process. It was not until the 1930s that the descendants of emancipated slaves began a movement for political rights. One of the leaders of this movement,  Sir Grantley Adams , founded the  Barbados Labour Party  in 1938, then known as the Barbados Progressive League. While being a staunch supporter of the monarchy, Adams and his party also demanded more rights for the poor and for the people. Progress toward a more democratic government in Barbados was made in 1942, when the exclusive income qualification was lowered and women were given the right to vote. By 1949 governmental control was wrested from the planters and, in 1958, Adams became Premier of Barbados.   From 1958 to 1962, Barbados was one of the ten members of the  West Indies Federation , an organisation doomed by nationalistic attitudes and by the fact that its members, as British colonies, held limited legislative power. Adams served as its first and only ""Premier"", but his leadership failed in attempts to form similar unions, and his continued defence of the monarchy was used by his opponents as evidence that he was no longer in touch with the needs of his country.  Errol Walton Barrow , a fervent reformer, became the new people's advocate. Barrow had left the BLP and formed the  Democratic Labour Party  as a liberal alternative to Adams' conservative government. Barrow instituted many progressive social programmes, such as free education for all Barbadians, and the School Meals system. By 1961, Barrow had replaced Adams as Premier and the DLP controlled the government.   With the Federation dissolved, Barbados had reverted to its former status, that of a  self-governing colony . The island negotiated its own independence at a constitutional conference with the United Kingdom in June 1966. After years of peaceful and democratic progress, Barbados finally became an independent state on 30 November 1966, with Errol Barrow its first Prime Minister. Upon independence Barbados maintained historical linkages with Britain by establishing membership to the  Commonwealth of Nations  grouping, a year later Barbados' International linkages were expanded by obtaining membership to the  United Nations  and the  Organization of American States .     [ edit ]   Government and politics          Parliamentary building.           Main articles:  Politics of Barbados  and  Monarchy of Barbados       Barbados has been an independent country since 30 November 1966. It functions as a  constitutional monarchy  and  parliamentary democracy , modeled on the British  Westminster system , with  Elizabeth II ,  Queen of Barbados , as  head of state  represented locally by the  Governor-General ,  Clifford Husbands  and the  Prime Minister  as the  head of the government . Its  Parliament  comprises thirty seats. It has been proposed that Barbados become a  republic  with a  president  replacing the  Barbadian sovereign ; this issue is still being debated, as the island has been stable and governmentally autonomous for decades.   Barbados is a full and participating member of the  Caribbean Community  (CARICOM), the  Caribbean (CARICOM) Single Market and Economy  (CSME), the  Caribbean Court of Justice  (CCJ), which pertains only to Barbados and  Guyana  but is expected to replace the UK  Privy Council  for the entire English-speaking Caribbean eventually, and the  Association of Caribbean States  (ACS). [ 7 ]   Barbados has a two party system, the two dominant parties being the ruling  Democratic Labour Party  and the  Barbados Labour Party . The Barbados Labour Party (BLP) had been in government for fifteen years, since 1993 until the 2008 general election. Under this administration, the Former Prime Minister, The Right Honourable Owen S. Arthur also acted as the Regional Leader of the CSM (Caribbean Single Market). The Right Honorable David Thompson is the Prime Minister of Barbados. [ 8 ]   On 11 April 2006, the 5-Member  UNCLOS  Annex VII Arbitral Tribunal, presided over by H.E. Judge  Stephen M. Schwebel , rendered after two years of international judicial proceedings, the landmark Barbados/Trinidad and Tobago Award, which resolved the maritime boundary delimitation (in the East, Central and West sectors) to satisfaction of both Parties and committed Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago to resolve their fisheries dispute by means of concluding a new Fisheries Agreement.     [ edit ]   Geography and climate of Barbados       Main article:  Geography and climate of Barbados              Map of Barbados              Beach near  Bridgetown , Barbados.       Barbados is extremely small for a Caribbean island. Relatively flat, it rises gently to the central highland region, the highest point being  Mount Hillaby , in the Scotland District, at 340 meters (1,100 ft) above sea level. The island is located in the Atlantic Ocean, to the east of the other Caribbean islands. The  climate  is tropical, with a rainy season from June to October.   Barbados is often spared the worst effects of the region's tropical storms and  hurricanes  during the rainy season as its far eastern location in the Atlantic Ocean puts it just outside the principal hurricane strike zone, and a hurricane hits about every 26 years. The last significant hit from a hurricane to cause severe damage to Barbados was  Hurricane Janet  in 1955.   In the parish of  Saint Michael  lies Barbados' capital and main city,  Bridgetown . Locally Bridgetown is sometimes referred to as ""The City"", but the most common reference is simply ""Town"". Other towns scattered across the island include  Holetown , in the parish of  Saint James ;  Oistins , in the parish of  Christ Church , and Speightstown, in the parish of  Saint Peter .   It is geologically composed of coral (90 m/300 ft thick). The land falls in a series of ""terraces"" in the west and goes into an incline in the east. Most of Barbados is circled by coral reefs.   The climate is moderate tropical with two seasons: dry and wet. The dry season (DecemberMay) and wet season (JuneNovember) gives an annual rainfall of 40-90 inches (1,0002,300 mm).     [ edit ]   Parishes       Main article:  Parishes of Barbados              Map of the parishes of Barbados       Barbados is  divided  into eleven administrative  parishes :     Christ Church   Saint Andrew   Saint George   Saint James   Saint John   Saint Joseph   Saint Lucy   Saint Michael   Saint Peter   Saint Philip   Saint Thomas       [ edit ]   Economy       Main article:  Economy of Barbados       Historically, the economy of Barbados had been dependent on  sugarcane  cultivation and related activities, but in recent years it has diversified into the  manufacturing  and  tourism  sectors. Offshore finance and information services have become important foreign exchange earners, and there is a healthy light manufacturing sector. In recent years the Government has been seen as business-friendly and economically sound. Since the late 1990s the island has seen a construction boom, with the development and redevelopment of hotels, office complexes, and homes.   The government continues its efforts to reduce  unemployment , encourage direct foreign investment, and privatize remaining state-owned enterprises. Unemployment has been reduced from around 14 percent in the past to under 10 percent.          Circulating  coins  2006       The economy contracted in 2001 and 2002 due to slowdowns in tourism, consumer spending and the impact of the  September 11, 2001 attacks , but rebounded in 2003 and has shown growth since 2004. Traditional trading partners include Canada, the  Caribbean Community  (especially  Trinidad and Tobago ), the United Kingdom and the United States.   Business links and investment flows have become substantial: as of 2003 the island saw from Canada  CA$  25 billion in investment holdings, placing it as one of Canada's top five destinations for Canadian  Foreign Direct Investment  (FDI). Businessman  Eugene Melnyk  of  Toronto , Canada, is said to be Barbados' richest permanent resident.   It was thought by key Barbadian industry sources that the year 2006 would have been one of the busiest years for building construction ever in Barbados, as the building-boom on the island entered the final stages for several multi-million dollar projects. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Transport       Main article:  Transport in Barbados       Transport on the island is good, with 'route taxis', called ""ZR's"" (pronounced "" Zed -Rs"" not ""Zee-Rs""), travelling to most points on the island. These small buses can at times be crowded, as passengers are generally never turned down, regardless of the number. However, they will usually take the more scenic routes to destinations. They generally depart from the capital  Bridgetown  or from  Speightstown  in the northern part of the island.          A  Mini Moke  at  Speightstown  beach       The island of Barbados's lone airport is the  Sir Grantley Adams International Airport (GAIA)  ( IATA  identifier  BGI ). It receives daily flights by several major airlines from points around the globe, as well as several smaller regional commercial airlines and charters. The airport serves as the main air-transportation hub for the Eastern Caribbean. It is undergoing a US$100 million upgrade and expansion.   There are three bus systems running seven days a week (though less frequently on Sundays), and a ride on any of them costs $1.50 BBD. The smaller buses from the two privately-owned systems (""ZRs"" and ""minibuses"") can give change; the larger blue and yellow buses from the government-operated  Barbados Transport Board  system cannot. Most routes require a connection in Bridgetown. Some drivers within the competitive privately owned systems are reluctant to advise persons to use competing services, even if those would be more suitable.   Some hotels also provide visitors with shuttles to points of interest on the island from outside the hotel lobby. There are several locally-owned and -operated vehicle rental agencies in Barbados but there are no multi-national car-rental agencies such as Avis, Europcar or Hertz.   There is also a helicopter shuttle service, which offers air taxi services to a number of sites around the island, mainly on the West Coast tourist belt. Air and water traffic is regulated by the  Barbados Port Authority .     [ edit ]   Tourist information   The island is well developed, and there are internationally known hotels offering world-class accommodation. Time-shares are available, and many of the smaller local hotels and private villas which dot the island have space available if booked in advance. The southern and western coasts of Barbados are popular, with the calm light blue Atlantic Ocean and their fine white and pinkish sandy beaches. Along the island's east coast the Atlantic Ocean side are tumbling waves which are perfect for light  surfing , but a little bit risky due to under-tow currents.   Shopping  districts are popular in Barbados, with ample duty-free shopping. There is also a festive night-life in mainly tourist areas such as the  Saint Lawrence Gap . Other attractions include wildlife reserves, jewellery stores,  scuba diving , helicopter rides,  golf ,  festivals  (the largest being the annual crop over festival July/Aug), sightseeing, cave exploration, exotic  drinks  and fine  clothes   shopping .     [ edit ]   Attractions, landmarks and points of interest   Tourism accounts for almost one half of the economy.

Close to 90% of all Barbadians (also known colloquially as  Bajan ) are of  African  descent (""Afro-Bajans""). A mix of many African ethnicities, notably the  Igbo ,  Akan  and  Yoruba people , they are mostly descendants of the  slave  labourers on the sugar plantations. The remainder of the population includes groups of Europeans (""Anglo-Bajans"" / ""Euro-Bajans"") mainly from the  United Kingdom , the  Republic of Ireland , Chinese locally known as Bajan-Chiney, Bajan Hindus from  India  and Muslims from  Bangladesh  and  Pakistan , and an influential ""Arab-Bajans"" group mainly of Christian  Syrians  and  Lebanese  descent. On the island are many people of  Creole  descent, a mixture of Afro-Caribbean and European descent (Primarily British, Irish and  Portuguese ).   Other groups in Barbados include people from the  United Kingdom ,  United States  and  Canada . Barbadians who return after years of residence in the U.S. are called ""Bajan Yankees""; this term is considered derogatory by some.   The country's official language is English, the local dialect of which is referred to as  Bajan , spoken by most. In religion, most Barbadians are  Christians  (67%), chiefly of the  Anglican Church , but there are Protestant,  Roman Catholic ,  Jehovah's Witness ,  Hindu ,  Muslim  and  Jewish  minorities. Barbados is a chief destination for emigrants from the South American nation of  Guyana . The biggest communities outside the Afro-Caribbean community are:     The  Indo-Guyanese , an important part of the economy due to the increase of immigrants from partner country  Guyana . There are reports of a growing Indo-Bajan diaspora originating from Guyana and  India . They introduced soca-chutney ,  roti  and many Indian dishes to Barbados' culture. Mostly from southern India and Hindu states, these 'Desi' peoples are growing in size but smaller than the equivalent communities in Trinidad & Guyana; Hinduism is one of Barbados' growing religions.   Euro-Bajans (4% of the population) [ 10 ]  have settled in Barbados since the 1500s, originating from  England , Portugal, Ireland and  Scotland . In 1643, there were 37,200 whites in Barbados (86% of the population). [ 11 ]  More commonly they are known as "" White Bajans "", although some carry Afro-Caribbean traces and vice-versa. Euro-Bajans introduced folk music, such as  Irish music  and Highland music, and certain place names, such as ""Scotland"", a mountainous region, and ""Trafalgar Square"" in Bridgetown, now renamed ""Heroes Square"". Among White Barbadians there exists an underclass known as  Redlegs ; the descendants of  indentured servants , and prisoners imported to the island. [ 12 ]   Chinese -Barbadians (or, as they are known on the island, ""Bajan-Chineys"") are a small portion of Barbados' Asian demographics, smaller than the equivalent communities of  Jamaica  and  Trinidad . Most if not all first arrived in the 1940s during the Second World War, originating mainly from the then British territory of  Hong Kong . Many Chinese-Bajans have the surnames Chin, Chynn or Lee, although other surnames prevail in certain areas of the island. Chinese food and culture is becoming part of everyday Bajan culture.   Lebanese and Syrians form the Middle Eastern community on the island and make up 89% of the Muslim population. Middle-Eastern Barbadians are often perceived to be the most successful group in business, along with the Chinese Bajans. During the  Arab Israeli Wars , many Syrians and Lebanese headed for the West Indies to escape conflict and poverty in the  Middle East . [ citation needed ]  Also Jewish people arrived in Barbados around the same time, creating the biggest synagogue in the West Indies.   Latin Americans have been migrating to the island since the 18th century, due to the close proximity of  South America , many  Venezuelans  had migrated to Barbados as labourers via Trinidad.  Brazilian Jews ,  Colombians  and  Panamanians  also live on the island. The Spanish language is now being encouraged to be taught as a second language in Barbadian schools over French.       [ edit ]   Culture          Banks beer at dusk           Main article:  Culture of Barbados     See also:  Music of Barbados     The influence of the English on Barbados is more noticeable than on other islands in the West Indies. A good example of this is the island's national sport:  cricket . Barbados has brought forth several great cricketers, including  Garfield Sobers  and  Frank Worrell .   Citizens are officially called Barbadians; Barbados' residents, however, colloquially refer to themselves or the products of the country as ""Bajan"". The term ""Bajan"" may have come from a localized pronunciation of the word Barbadian which at times can sound more like ""Bar-bajan"".   The largest  carnival -like cultural event which takes place on the island is the  Crop Over  festival. As in many other Caribbean and Latin American countries,  Crop Over  is an important event for many people on the island, as well as the thousands of tourists that flock to the island to participate in the annual events. The festival includes musical competitions and other traditional activities. It gets under way from the beginning of July, and ends with the costumed parade on Kadooment Day, held on the first Monday of August.   Barbados retains a strong British influence and is referred to by its neighbours as ""Little England"".     [ edit ]   Sports in Barbados     See also:  Cricket in the West Indies     As in other Caribbean countries of British descent,  cricket  is a favourite sport. In addition to several warm-up matches and six ""Super Eight"" matches, Barbados hosted the final of the  2007 Cricket World Cup .   In  golf , the  Barbados Open  is an annual stop on the  European Seniors Tour . In December 2006 the  WGC-World Cup  took place at the country's  Sandy Lane  resort on the Country Club course, an eighteen-hole course designed by  Tom Fazio .   Motorsports also play a role, with Rally Barbados occurring each summer and currently being listed on the FIA NACAM calendar.   Basketball  is a popular sport played at school or college and is increasing in popularity as is  volleyball , though volleyball is mainly played inside. At certain beaches such as Brandons beach in St. Michael people do get together to play  beach volleyball .   Other sports played include  hockey ,  table tennis ,  road tennis ,  football ,  rugby ,  polo  and  swimming .   Netball  is also popular with women in Barbados.     [ edit ]   National symbols     [ edit ]   Flower          A yellow and red Pride of Barbados ( Caesalpinia pulcherrima ).       The national flower is the Pride of Barbados or  Caesalpinia pulcherrima  (L.) Sw., which grows across the island.     [ edit ]   Flag   The tridented centered within the flag is a representation of the mythological  Neptune , god of the sea. The trident in its original unbroken form was taken from the former colonial seal, which itself was replaced by the current coat of arms. Used within the national flag, the left and right shafts of the trident were then designed as 'broken' representing the nation of Barbados breaking away from its historical and constitutional ties as a former colony.   The three points of the  trident  represent in Barbados the three principles of  democracy  - ""government of, for and by the people."" The broken trident is set in a centered vertical band of gold representing the sands of Barbados' beaches. The gold band itself is surrounded on both sides by vertical bands of ultramarine (blue) representing the sea and sky of Barbados.   The design for the flag was created by Grantley W. Prescod and was chosen from an open competition arranged by the Barbados government. Over a thousand entries were received. [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   Golden Shield   The Golden Shield in the coat of arms carries two "" Pride of Barbados "" flowers and the ""bearded"" fig tree ( Ficus citrifolia  or  Ficus barbata ), which was common on the island at the time of its settlement by the British and may have contributed to Barbados being so named.     [ edit ]   Coat of arms   The  coat of arms  depicts two animals which are supporting the shield. On the left is a "" dolphin fish "", symbolic of the fishing industry and seagoing past of Barbados. On the right is a  pelican , symbolic of a small island named  Pelican Island  that once existed off the coast of Bridgetown. Above the shield is the helmet of Barbados with an extended arm clutching two  sugar-cane  stalks. The ""cross"" formation made by the cane stalks represents the saltire cross upon which  Saint Andrew  was crucified. On the base of the Coat of Arms reads ""Pride and Industry"" in reference to the country's motto.     [ edit ]   National heroes       Main article:  Barbadian national heroes       On April 1998, the Order of National Heroes Act was passed by the  Parliament of Barbados . According to the government, the act established that 28 April (the centenary of the birth of Sir Grantley Adams) would be celebrated as  National Heroes' Day . The act also declared that there are ten national heroes of Barbados. All of which would be elevated to the title of the The Right Excellent.

The South African coast stretches 2,798 kilometres (1,739 mi) [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  and borders both the  Atlantic  and  Indian   oceans . [ 7 ]  To the north of South Africa lie  Namibia ,  Botswana  and  Zimbabwe , to the east are  Mozambique  and  Swaziland , while the  Kingdom of Lesotho  is an independent  enclave  surrounded by South African territory. [ 8 ]   Modern human beings have inhabited South Africa for more than 100,000 years. [ 9 ]  A century and a half after the discovery of the  Cape Sea Route , the  Dutch East India Company   founded  a refreshment station at what would become  Cape Town  in 1652. [ 10 ]  Cape Town became a British colony in 1806. European settlement expanded during the 1820s as the  Boers  (original  Dutch ,  Flemish ,  German  and  French  settlers) and the British  1820 Settlers  claimed land in the north and east of the country. Conflicts arose among the Xhosa, Zulu and Afrikaner groups. However, the discovery of diamonds and later gold triggered the conflict known as the  Anglo-Boer War  as the Boers and the British fought for the control of the South African mineral wealth. Although the Boers were defeated, limited independence was given to South Africa in 1910 as a British dominion. Anti-British policies focused on ultimate independence which was achieved in 1961 when South Africa was declared a  republic . The leading  National Party  legislated for a continuation of racial segregation begun under Dutch and British colonial rule, Boer republics, and subsequent South African governments (and which in 1948 became legally institutionalised  segregation  known as  apartheid ), despite opposition both in and outside of the country. In 1990 the then president  F.W. de Klerk  began to dismantle this legislation, and in 1994 the first democratic election was held in South Africa. This election brought  Nelson Mandela  and the current ruling party, the  African National Congress  to power, and the country rejoined the  Commonwealth of Nations .   South Africa is known for its diversity in cultures, languages, and religious beliefs, and eleven official languages are recognised in its  constitution . [ 7 ]  English is the most commonly spoken language in official and commercial public life, however it is only the fifth most spoken home language. [ 7 ]  South Africa is ethnically diverse, with the largest  Caucasian ,  Indian , and  racially mixed  communities in Africa. Although 79.6% of the South African population is  Black , [ 2 ]  this category is neither culturally nor linguistically homogeneous, as people within this classification speak a number of different  Bantu languages , nine of which have official status. [ 7 ]  Midyear 2007, the South African population was estimated at 47.9 million.

(September 2008)       Main article:  History of South Africa   South Africa contains some of the oldest archaeological sites in the world. [ 11 ]   [ 12 ]  Extensive fossil remains at the  Sterkfontein ,  Kromdraai  and Makapansgat caves suggest that various  australopithecines  existed in South Africa from about three million years ago. [ 13 ]  These were succeeded by various species of  Homo , including  Homo habilis ,  Homo erectus  and modern humans,  Homo sapiens . Settlements of  Bantu -speaking peoples, who were  iron -using agriculturists and herdsmen, were already present south of the  Limpopo River  by the fourth or fifth century (see  Bantu expansion ) displacing and absorbing the original  KhoiSan  speakers. They slowly moved south and the earliest ironworks in modern-day  KwaZulu-Natal Province  are believed to date from around 1050. The southernmost group was the  Xhosa  people, whose language incorporates certain linguistic traits from the earlier KhoiSan people, reaching the  Fish River , in today's  Eastern Cape Province . These  Iron Age  populations displaced earlier people, who often had  hunter-gatherer  societies, as they migrated.     European colonisation          Painting of an account of the arrival of  Jan van Riebeeck , the first  European  to settle in South Africa, with  Devil's Peak  in the background       In 1487, the  Portuguese  explorer  Bartolomeu Dias  became the first European to reach the southernmost point of Africa. Initially named The Cape of Storms, The King of Portugal,  John II , renamed it the  Cabo da Boa Esperana  or  Cape of Good Hope  as it led to the riches of India. This great feat of navigation was later immortalised in  Cames ' epic Portuguese poem,  The Lusiads  (1572). In 1652, a refreshment station was established at the  Cape of Good Hope  by  Jan van Riebeeck  on behalf of the  Dutch East India Company .  Slaves  were brought from  Indonesia ,  Madagascar , and India as a labour source for the Dutch immigrants in  Cape Town . As they expanded east, the Dutch settlers eventually met the south-westerly expanding  Xhosa  people in the region of the  Fish River . A series of wars, called the  Cape Frontier Wars , ensued, mainly caused by conflicting land and livestock interests.   Great Britain  took over the  Cape of Good Hope  area in 1795 ostensibly to stop it falling into the hands of the Revolutionary French, but also seeking to use  Cape Town  in particular as a stop on the route to Australia and India. It was later returned to the Dutch in 1803, but soon afterwards the  Dutch East India Company  declared bankruptcy, and the British annexed the Cape Colony in 1806. The British continued the frontier wars against the Xhosa, pushing the eastern frontier eastward through a line of forts established along the Fish River and consolidating it by encouraging  British settlement . Due to pressure of  abolitionist  societies in Britain, the  British parliament  first stopped its global  slave trade  with the passage of the  Slave Trade Act 1807 , then abolished slavery in all its colonies with the  Slavery Abolition Act 1833 . During the 1830s, approximately 12 000  Boers  (later known as  Voortrekkers ), departed from the  Cape Colony , where they were subjected to British control, to the future Natal, Orange Free State and Transvaal regions. The Boers founded the  Boer Republics  - the  South African Republic  (Now  Gauteng ,  Limpopo ,  Mpumalanga  and  North West  provinces) and the  Orange Free State  ( Free State ).   The discovery of  diamonds  in 1867 and  gold  in 1884 in the interior encouraged economic growth and immigration, intensifying the subjugation of the indigenous people. These important economic resources did not only play a role between European and the indigenous population but also between the Boers and the British. [ 14 ]   The  Boer Republics  successfully resisted British encroachments during the  First Boer War  (18801881) using  guerrilla warfare  tactics, much better suited to local conditions. However, the British returned in greater numbers, more experience, and more suitable tactics in the  Second Boer War  (18991902). The Boers' attempt to ally themselves with  German South-West Africa  provided the British with yet another excuse to take control of the Boer Republics. [ citation needed ]           Boers  in combat (1881).         Independence   After four years of negotiating, the  Union of South Africa  was created from the  Cape  and  Natal  colonies, as well as the republics of  Orange Free State  and  Transvaal , on 31 May 1910, exactly eight years after the end of the Second Boer War. The newly created Union of South Africa was a  dominion . The  Natives' Land Act  of 1913 severely restricted the ownership of land by 'blacks', at that stage to a mere 7% of the country, although this amount was eventually increased marginally. [ 15 ]  The union was effectively granted independence from the United Kingdom with the passage of the  Statute of Westminster , which morphed the  British king's  position within South Africa into that of the distinct  King of South Africa . In 1934, the  South African Party  and  National Party  merged to form the  United Party , seeking reconciliation between Afrikaners and English-speaking ""Whites"", but split in 1939 over the entry of the Union into  World War II  as an ally of the United Kingdom, a move which the National Party strongly opposed.   In 1948, the  National Party  was elected to power, and intensified the implementation of racial segregation that had begun under Dutch and British colonial rule, and subsequent South African governments since the Union was formed. The Nationalist Government systematised existing segregationist laws, and the system of segregation became known collectively as  apartheid . Not surprisingly, this segregation also applied to the wealth acquired during rapid industrialisation of the 1950s, '60s, and '70s. While the White minority enjoyed the highest  standard of living  in all of Africa, often comparable to  First World  western nations, the Black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard, including income, education, housing, and life expectancy. On 31 May 1961, following a whites-only  referendum , the country became a  republic  and left the (British)  Commonwealth . The office of  Governor-General  was abolished and replaced with the position of  State President .   Apartheid became increasingly controversial, leading to widespread  sanctions ,  divestment  and growing unrest and oppression within South Africa. (See also the article on the  History of South Africa in the apartheid era .) A long period of harsh suppression by the government, and at times violent resistance,  strikes , marches, protests, and  sabotage  by bombing and other means, by various anti-apartheid movements, most notably the  African National Congress  (ANC), followed. In the late 1970s, South Africa began a programme of  nuclear weapons  development and in the following decade it produced six deliverable nuclear weapons. The rationale for the nuclear arsenal is disputed, but it is believed [ who? ]  that  Vorster  and  P.W. Botha  wanted to be able to catalyse American intervention in the event of a war between South Africa and the  Cuban -supported  MPLA  government of  Angola .     Democracy   In 1990 the  National Party  government took the first step towards negotiating itself out of power when it lifted the ban on the  African National Congress  and other  left-wing  political organisations, and released  Nelson Mandela  from prison after twenty-seven years' incarceration on a  sabotage  sentence. Apartheid legislation was gradually removed from the statute books, and South Africa also destroyed its nuclear arsenal and acceded to the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . The first  multi-racial elections  were held in 1994, which the ANC won by an overwhelming majority. It has been in power ever since.   In  post-apartheid South Africa , millions of South Africans, mostly black, continued to live in  poverty , though poverty among whites, previously rare, has increased greatly. [ 16 ]  While some have partly attributed this to the legacy of the apartheid system, increasingly many attribute it to the failure of the current government to tackle social issues, coupled with the monetary and fiscal discipline of the current government to ensure both redistribution of wealth and economic growth. Since the ANC-led government took power, the  United Nations   Human Development Index  of South Africa has fallen, while it was steadily rising until the mid-1990s. [ 17 ]  Some of this could possibly be attributed to the  AIDS   pandemic  and the failure of the government to take steps to address it, [ 18 ] some of it can also be pinpointed to a government policy of  redistribution of wealth . As a mitigating factor, the social housing policy of the current government has produced an improvement in living conditions.     Politics   Main articles:  Politics of South Africa ,  Government of South Africa , and  Law of South Africa          The  Union Buildings  in  Pretoria  is the home of the South African executive.       South Africa has three capital cities:  Cape Town , the largest of the three, is the  legislative  capital;  Pretoria  is the  administrative  capital; and  Bloemfontein  is the  judicial  capital. South Africa has a  bicameral   parliament : the  National Council of Provinces  (the  upper house ) has 90 members, while the  National Assembly  (the  lower house ) has 400 members. Members of the lower house are elected on a population basis by  proportional representation : half of the members are elected from national lists and the other half are elected from provincial lists. Ten members are elected to represent each province in the National Council of Provinces, regardless of the population of the province. Elections for both chambers are held every five years. The government is formed in the lower house, and the leader of the majority party in the National Assembly is the  President .   The primary sources of South Africa law are Roman-Dutch mercantile law and personal law with English Common law, as imports of Dutch settlements and  British colonialism . [ 19 ]  The first European based law in South Africa was brought by the  Dutch East India Company  and is called  Roman-Dutch law . It was imported before the  codification  of European law into the  Napoleonic Code  and is comparable in many ways to  Scots law . This was followed in the 19th century by  English law , both  common  and  statutory . Starting in 1910 with unification, South Africa had its own  parliament  which passed laws specific for South Africa, building on those previously passed for the individual member colonies.   Current South African politics are dominated by the  African National Congress  (ANC), which received 69.7% of the vote during the last  2004 general election  and 66.3% of the vote in the  2006 municipal election . The current  President of South Africa  is  Kgalema Motlanthe , who replaced  Thabo Mbeki  on 25 September 2008. Mbeki succeeded former President  Nelson Mandela  in 1999, and was re-elected for a second five year term in 2004, but announced his resignation on 20 September 2008.   The main challenger to the rule of the ANC is the  Democratic Alliance  party, which received 12.4% of the vote in the 2004 election and 14.8% in the 2006 election.  Helen Zille , (elected 6 May 2007), is the party leader; the previous leader was  Tony Leon . The formerly dominant  New National Party , which introduced apartheid through its predecessor, the  National Party , chose to merge with the ANC on 9 April 2005. Other major political parties represented in Parliament are the  Inkatha Freedom Party , which mainly represents  Zulu  voters, and the  Independent Democrats , who took 6.97% and 1.7% of the vote respectively, in the 2004 election.   Since 2004, the country has had many thousands of popular protests, some violent, making it, according to one academic, the ""most protest-rich country in the world"". [ 20 ]  Many of these protests have been organised from the growing  shanty towns  that surround South African cities.     Foreign relations and military   Main articles:  South African National Defence Force ,  Foreign relations of South Africa , and  South Africa and weapons of mass destruction   Since the end of apartheid, the South African foreign policy has focused on its African partners particularly in the  Southern African Development Community  (SADC) and the  African Union . South Africa has played a key role as a mediator in African conflicts over the last decade, such as in  Burundi , the  Democratic Republic of Congo , the  Comoros , and  Zimbabwe . After apartheid ended, South Africa was readmitted to the  Commonwealth of Nations . As the  Union of South Africa , South Africa was a founding member of the  United Nations  and the then Prime Minister  Jan Smuts  wrote the preamble to its constitution. South Africa is currently a non-permanent member of the  United Nations Security Council  and has attracted controversy by voting against a resolution criticising the  Burmese  government in 2006 and against the implementation of sanctions against  Zimbabwe  in 2008. South Africa is a member of the  Group of 77  and chaired the organisation in 2006. South Africa is a member of the  South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone ,  Southern African Customs Union ,  World Trade Organization ,  International Monetary Fund ,  G20  and  G8+5 .   The South African  armed forces , known as the  South African National Defence Force  (SANDF), was created in 1994. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  Previously known as the  South African Defence Force  (SADF), the new force is an all volunteer army and consists of the forces of the old SADF, as well as the forces of the African nationalist groups, namely  Umkhonto we Sizwe  (MK),  Azanian People's Liberation Army  (APLA), and the former  Bantustan  defence forces. [ 21 ]  The SANDF is subdivided into four branches, the  South African Army , the  South African Air Force , the  South African Navy , and the  South African Military Health Services . [ 23 ]   In recent years, the SANDF has become a major  peacekeeping  force in Africa, [ 24 ]  and has been involved in operations in  Lesotho , the  Democratic Republic of the Congo , [ 24 ]  and  Burundi , [ 24 ]  amongst others. It has also participated as a part of multi-national  UN  peacekeeping forces.   South Africa undertook a nuclear weapons programme in the 1970s [ 25 ]  and  may have conducted  a nuclear test over the  Atlantic  in 1979. [ 26 ]  It is the only African country to have successfully  developed nuclear weapons . It has become the first country (followed by Ukraine) with nuclear capability to voluntarily renounce and dismantle its programme and in the process signed the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty  in 1991. [ 25 ]     Provinces, districts and municipalities   Main articles:  Provinces of South Africa ,  Districts of South Africa , and  Municipalities of South Africa          Map showing the provinces and districts (numbered) of South Africa.             Northern Cape          North West          Gauteng          Limpopo          Mpumalanga            KwaZulu-Natal          Eastern Cape          Free State          Western Cape               When apartheid ended in 1994, the South African government had to integrate the formerly independent and semi-independent  Bantustans  into the political structure of South Africa. To this end, it abolished the four former provinces of South Africa ( Cape Province ,  Natal ,  Orange Free State , and  Transvaal ) and replaced them with nine fully integrated provinces. The new provinces are usually much smaller than the former provinces, which theoretically gives local governments more resources to distribute over smaller areas.   The nine provinces are further subdivided into  52 districts :  6 metropolitan  and  46 district municipalities . The 46 district municipalities are further subdivided into  231 local municipalities . The district municipalities also contain 20 district management areas (mostly game parks) that are directly governed by the district municipalities. The six metropolitan municipalities perform the functions of both district and local municipalities. The new provinces are:       Province   Former homelands and provinces   Capital   Area (km)   Area (sq mi)   Population (2001)       Eastern Cape   Cape Province ,  Transkei ,  Ciskei   Bhisho   169,580   65,475   6,436,761       Free State   Orange Free State ,  QwaQwa   Bloemfontein   129,480   49,992   2,706,776       Gauteng   Transvaal   Johannesburg   17,010   6,568   8,837,172       KwaZulu-Natal   Natal ,  KwaZulu   Pietermaritzburg   92,100   35,560   9,426,018       Limpopo   Transvaal ,  Venda ,  Lebowa ,  Gazankulu   Polokwane   123,900   47,838   5,273,637       Mpumalanga   Transvaal ,  KwaNdebele ,  KaNgwane ,  Bophuthatswana ,  Lebowa   Nelspruit   79,490   30,691   3,122,994       Northern Cape   Cape Province   Kimberley   361,830   139,703   822,726       North West   Transvaal ,  Cape Province ,  Bophuthatswana   Mafikeng   116,320   44,911   3,669,349       Western Cape   Cape Province   Cape Town   129,370   49,950   4,524,335       Total   1,219,080   470,688   44,819,768         Geography   Main article:  Geography of South Africa          Map of South Africa       South Africa is located at the southernmost region of Africa, with a long  coastline  that stretches more than 2,500 kilometres (1,550 mi) and across two  oceans  (the South  Atlantic  and the  Indian ). At 470,979  sq mi  (1,219,912 km), [ 27 ]  South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world (after  Mali ). It is comparable in size to  Colombia .  Njesuthi  in the  Drakensberg  at 3,408 m (11,424 ft) is the highest peak in South Africa.          View of the  Drakensberg mountains , the highest mountain range in South Africa.       South Africa has a generally  temperate climate , due in part to it being surrounded by the  Atlantic  and  Indian Oceans  on three sides, by its location in the climatically milder  southern hemisphere  and due to the average elevation rising steadily towards the north (towards the  equator ) and further inland. Due to this varied topography and oceanic influence, a great variety of climatic zones exist.   The climatic zones vary, from the extreme  desert  of the southern  Namib  in the farthest northwest to the lush  subtropical  climate in the east along the  Mozambique  border and the  Indian  ocean. From the east, the land quickly rises over a  mountainous   escarpment  towards the interior  plateau  known as the  Highveld . Even though South Africa is classified as  semi-arid , there is considerable variation in  climate  as well as  topography .   The interior of South Africa is a vast, rather flat, and sparsely populated  scrubland ,  Karoo , which is drier towards the northwest along the Namib desert. In contrast, the eastern coastline is lush and well-watered, which produces a climate similar to the tropics. The extreme southwest has a climate remarkably similar to that of the  Mediterranean  with wet winters and hot, dry summers, hosting the famous  Fynbos   Biome . This area also produces much of the  wine  in South Africa. This region is also particularly known for its wind, which blows intermittently almost all year. The severity of this wind made passing around the  Cape of Good Hope  particularly treacherous for sailors, causing many  shipwrecks . Further east on the south coast, rainfall is distributed more evenly throughout the year, producing a green landscape. This area is popularly known as the  Garden Route .          Satellite picture of South Africa       The  Free State  is particularly flat due to the fact that it lies centrally on the high plateau. North of the  Vaal River , the Highveld becomes better watered and does not experience subtropical extremes of heat.  Johannesburg , in the centre of the Highveld, is at 1,740 metres (5,709 ft) and receives an annual rainfall of 760 millimetres (30  in ). Winters in this region are cold, although  snow  is rare.   To the north of Johannesburg, the altitude drops beyond the escarpment of the Highveld, and turns into the lower lying Bushveld, an area of mixed dry forest and an abundance of wildlife. East of the Highveld, beyond the eastern escarpment, the Lowveld stretches towards the  Indian  ocean. It has particularly high temperatures, and is also the location of extended subtropical agriculture.   The high  Drakensberg mountains , which form the south-eastern escarpment of the Highveld, offer limited  skiing  opportunities in winter. The coldest place in South Africa is  Sutherland  in the western  Roggeveld Mountains , where midwinter temperatures can reach as low as 15 degrees  Celsius  (5  F ). The deep interior has the hottest temperatures: A temperature of 51.7 C (125 F) was recorded in 1948 in the  Northern Cape  Kalahari near  Upington . [ 28 ]   South Africa also has one possession, the small sub-Antarctic archipelago of the  Prince Edward Islands , consisting of  Marion Island  (290 km/112 sq mi) and Prince Edward Island (45 km/17.3 sq mi) (not to be confused with the  Canadian province of the same name ).           Weather averages for Cape Town, South Africa         Month   Jan   Feb   Mar   Apr   May   Jun   Jul   Aug   Sep   Oct   Nov   Dec   Year       Average high C (F)   27  (81)   28  (82)   26  (79)   24  (75)   20  (68)   18  (64)   17  (63)   18  (64)   19  (66)   22  (72)   24  (75)   26  (79)   28  (82)       Average low C (F)   16  (61)   16  (61)   15  (59)   13  (55)   10  (50)   8  (46)   8  (46)   8  (46)   9  (48)   11  (52)   14  (57)   15  (59)   8  (46)       Precipitation  mm (inches)   16.5  (0.65)   13  (0.51)   20  (0.79)   54  (2.13)   92  (3.62)   111  (4.37)   96  (3.78)   87  (3.43)   56  (2.2)   40  (1.57)   24  (0.94)   18  (0.71)   627  (24.69)       Source: EuroWEATHER [ 29 ]  2008-02-22         Flora and fauna   See also:  Wildlife of South Africa   See also:  Protected areas of South Africa           Fynbos , a  floral kingdom  unique to South Africa, is found near  Cape Town               Swartberg  mountains near the town of  Oudtshoorn              A field of flowers in Weskus National Park.       South Africa is one of only 17 countries worldwide considered  megadiverse . It has more than 20,000 different  plants , or about 10% of all the known  species  of plants on  Earth , making it particularly rich in plant biodiversity. South Africa is the 6th most biodiverse country, [ 30 ]  after  Brazil ,  Colombia ,  Indonesia ,  China , and  Mexico . The most prevalent biome in South Africa is the  grassland , particularly on the  Highveld , where the plant cover is dominated by different  grasses , low  shrubs , and  acacia trees , mainly camel-thorn and whitethorn.  Vegetation  becomes even more sparse towards the northwest due to low  rainfall . There are several species of water-storing  succulents  like  aloes  and euphorbias in the very hot and dry  Namaqualand  area. The grass and thorn  savannah  turns slowly into a bush savannah towards the north-east of the country, with denser growth. There are significant numbers of  baobab  trees in this area, near the northern end of  Kruger National Park . [ 31 ]   The  Fynbos   Biome , which makes up the majority of the area and plant life in the  Cape floristic region , one of the six  floral kingdoms , is located in a small region of the  Western Cape  and contains more than 9,000 of those species, making it among the richest regions on earth in terms of floral biodiversity. The majority of the plants are  evergreen  hard-leaf plants with fine, needle-like  leaves , such as the  sclerophyllous  plants. Another uniquely South African plant is the  protea  genus of flowering plants. There are around 130 different species of protea in South Africa.   While South Africa has a great wealth of flowering plants, it has few  forests . Only 1% of South Africa is forest, almost exclusively in the  humid   coastal plain  along the  Indian Ocean  in  KwaZulu-Natal  (see  KwaZulu-Cape coastal forest mosaic ). There are even smaller reserves of forests that are out of the reach of  fire , known as montane forests (see  Knysna-Amatole montane forests ).  Plantations  of imported tree species are predominant, particularly the non-native  eucalyptus  and  pine . South Africa has lost a large area of natural habitat in the last four decades, primarily due to  overpopulation , sprawling development patterns and  deforestation  during the nineteenth century. South Africa is one of the worst affected countries in the world when it comes to invasion by alien species with many (e.g.  Black Wattle ,  Port Jackson ,  Hakea ,  Lantana  and  Jacaranda ) posing a significant threat to the native  biodiversity  and the already scarce water resources. The original  temperate forest  that met the first European settlers to South Africa was exploited ruthlessly until only small patches remained. Currently, South African  hardwood  trees like  Real Yellowwood   (Podocarpus latifolius) ,  stinkwood   (Ocotea bullata) , and South African  Black Ironwood   (Olea laurifolia)  are under government protection.   Numerous  mammals  are found in the  bushveld  habitats including  lions ,  leopards ,  white rhinos ,  blue wildebeest ,  kudus ,  impalas ,  hyenas ,  hippopotamus  and  giraffes . A significant extent of the bushveld habitat exists in the north-east including  Kruger National Park  and the  Mala Mala  Reserve, as well as in the far north in the  Waterberg Biosphere .   Climate change is expected to bring considerable warming and drying to much of this already semi-arid region, with greater frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, flooding and drought. According to computer generated climate modelling produced by the South African National Biodiversity Institute [ 32 ]  parts of southern Africa will see an increase in temperature by about one degree Celsius along the coast to more than four degrees Celsius in the already hot hinterland such as the  Northern Cape  in late spring and summertime by 2050.   The Cape Floral Kingdom has been identified as one of the global  biodiversity hotspots  since it will be hit very hard by  climate change  and has such a great diversity of life. Drought, increased intensity and frequency of fire and climbing temperatures are expected to push many of these  rare species  towards  extinction .   South Africa houses many endemic species, among them the  critically endangered   Riverine Rabbit  ( Bunolagus monticullaris ) in the  Karoo .     Economy   Main article:  Economy of South Africa          The  Victoria & Alfred Waterfront  in  Cape Town  with  Table Mountain  in the background. Cape Town has become an important  retail  and  tourism  centre for the country, and attracts the largest number of foreign visitors in South Africa       By  UN  classification South Africa is a middle-income country with an abundant supply of resources, well-developed financial, legal, communications, energy, and transport sectors, a  stock exchange  (the  JSE Limited ), that ranks among the top twenty in the world, and a modern infrastructure supporting an efficient distribution of goods to major urban centres throughout the entire region. South Africa is ranked 25th in the world in terms of  GDP  (PPP) as of 2007.   Advanced development is significantly localised around four areas: Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Durban, and Pretoria/Johannesburg. Beyond these four economic centres, development is marginal and poverty is still prevalent despite government efforts. Consequently the vast majority of South Africans are poor. However, key marginal areas have experienced rapid growth recently. Such areas include Mossel Bay to Plettenberg Bay; Rustenburg area; Nelspruit area; Bloemfontein; Cape West Coast; and the KwaZulu-Natal North Coast.   Even though South Africa has the seventh highest per capita income in Africa, only behind  Libya ,  Mauritius  it suffers from large income gaps and a  dual economy  marking it as a  developing country . South Africa has one of the highest rates of  income inequality  in the world. A decade of continual economic growth has helped to lower unemployment, but daunting economic and social problems remain. The average South African household income decreased considerably between 1995 and 2000. As for racial inequality,  Statistics South Africa  reported that in 1995 the average white household earned four times as much as the average black household. In 2000 the average white household was earning six times more than the average black household. [ 33 ]  The  affirmative action  policies have seen a rise in black economic wealth and an emerging black middle class. [ 34 ]  Other problems are crime, corruption, and  HIV / AIDS .   At the start of 2000, then President Thabo Mbeki vowed to promote economic growth and foreign investment by relaxing restrictive labour laws, stepping up the pace of  privatisation , and cutting unneeded governmental spending. His policies face strong opposition from organised  labour . South Africa is also the largest energy producer and consumer on the continent. South Africa is a popular tourist destination, and a substantial amount of revenue comes from tourism. [ 35 ]  Among the main attractions are the diverse and picturesque culture, the game reserves and the highly regarded local wines.   The South African  rand  (ZAR), is the most actively traded emerging  market currency  in the world. It has joined an elite club of fifteen currencies, the  Continuous linked settlement  (CLS), where forex transactions are settled immediately, lowering the risks of transacting across  time zones . The rand was the best-performing currency against the  United States dollar  (USD) between 2002 and 2005, according to the  Bloomberg  Currency Scorecard.   The volatility of the  rand  has affected economic activity, falling sharply during 2001 and hitting a historic low of 13.85  ZAR  to the  USD , raising fears of inflation, and causing the Reserve Bank to increase  interest rates . The rand has since recovered, trading at 7.13 ZAR to the dollar as of January 2008. However, as exporters are put under considerable pressure from a stronger domestic currency, many call for government intervention to help soften the rand.   Refugees from poorer neighbouring countries include many immigrants from the DRC, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Malawi and others, representing a large portion of the informal sector. With high unemployment levels amongst poorer South Africans,  xenophobia  is prevalent and many people born in South Africa feel resentful of immigrants who are seen to be depriving the native population of jobs, a feeling which has been given credibility by the fact that many South African employers have employed migrants from other countries for lower pay than South African citizens, especially in the  construction ,  tourism ,  agriculture  and  domestic service  industries. Illegal immigrants are also heavily involved in informal trading. [ 36 ]  However, many immigrants to South Africa continue to live in poor conditions, and the South African immigration policy has become increasingly restrictive since 1994. [ 37 ]   Principal international trading partners of South Africa  besides other African countries  include  Germany , the  United States ,  China ,  Japan , the  United Kingdom  and  Spain .  [ 38 ]  Chief exports include  corn ,  diamonds ,  fruits ,  gold ,  metals  and  minerals ,  sugar , and  wool .  Machinery  and transportation equipment make up more than one-third of the value of the countrys imports. Other imports include  chemicals , manufactured goods, and  petroleum .     Electricity crisis   After unsuccessful attempts by the government to encourage private construction of electricity generation capacity, in 2007 the state-owned electricity supplier ( Eskom ) started experiencing a lack of capacity in the electrical generating and reticulation infrastructure. This led to an inability to meet the routine demands of industry and consumers, resulting in countrywide  rolling blackouts . Initially the lack of capacity was triggered by a failure at  Koeberg nuclear power station , but since then a general lack of capacity became evident. The supplier has been widely criticised for failing to adequately plan for and construct sufficient electrical generating capacity, [ 39 ]  although ultimately the government has admitted that it is at fault for refusing to approve funding for investment in infrastructure. [ 40 ]     Agriculture          Workers planting on a farm in the central area of  Mpumalanga .               Farm  workers.       South Africa has a large agricultural sector and is a net exporter of  farming  products. There are almost a thousand  agricultural cooperatives  and  agribusinesses  throughout the country, and agricultural exports have constituted 8% of South African total exports for the past five years. The agricultural industry contributes around 10% of formal employment, relatively low compared to other parts of Africa, as well as providing work for casual labourers and contributing around 2.6% of  GDP  for the nation. [ 41 ]  However, due to the  aridity  of the land, only 13.5% can be used for crop production, and only 3% is considered high potential land. [ 42 ]   Although the commercial farming sector is relatively well developed, people in some rural areas still survive on  subsistence agriculture . It is the eighth largest wine producer in the world, and the eleventh largest producer of sunflower seed. South Africa is a net exporter of agricultural products and foodstuffs, the largest number of exported items being  sugar ,  grapes ,  citrus ,  nectarines ,  wine  and  deciduous  fruit. The largest locally produced crop is  maize  (corn), and it has been estimated that 9 million tons are produced every year, with 7.4 million tons being consumed.  Livestock  are also popular on South African farms, with the country producing 85% of all meat consumed. The dairy industry consists of around 4,300 milk producers providing employment for 60,000 farm workers and contributing to the livelihoods of around 40,000 others. [ 43 ]   In recent years, the agricultural sector has introduced several reforms, some of which are controversial, such as  land reform  and the deregulation of the market for agricultural products. Land reform has been criticised both by farmers' groups and by landless workers, the latter alleging that the pace of change has not been fast enough, and the former alleging racist treatment and expressing concerns that a similar situation to  Zimbabwe's land reform policy  may develop, [ 44 ]  a fear exacerbated by comments made by  deputy president , the deputy president of South Africa. [ 45 ] [ 46 ]  The sector continues to face problems, with increased foreign competition and crime being two of the major challenges for the industry. The government has been accused of either putting in too much effort [ 47 ] , or not enough effort [ 48 ] , to tackle the problem of  farm attacks  as opposed to other forms of violent crime.   Another issue which affects South African agriculture is environmental damage caused by misuse of the land and global climate change. South Africa is unusually vulnerable to climate change and resultant diminution of surface waters. Some predictions show surface water supply could decrease by 60% by the year 2070 in parts of the Western Cape. [ 49 ]  To reverse the damage caused by land mismanagement, the government has supported a scheme which promotes  sustainable development  and the use of natural resources. [ 50 ]  Maize production, which contributes to a 36% majority of the gross value of South Africas field crops, has also experienced negative effects due to climate change. The estimated value of loss, which takes into consideration scenarios with and without the carbon dioxide fertilisation effect  [2]  ,ranges between 10s to 100s of millions of Rands.

The western half of South Africa is sparsely populated, while the eastern half has a high  population  concentration.              The many migrations that formed the modern  Rainbow Nation .       South Africa is a nation of more than 48 million people of diverse origins,  cultures ,  languages , and  religions . The last  census  was held in 2001 and the next will be in 2011.  Statistics South Africa  provided five  racial  categories by which people could classify themselves, the last of which, ""unspecified/other"" drew negligible responses, and these results were omitted. [ 52 ]  The 2006 midyear estimated figures for the other categories were  Black African  at 79.5%,  White  at 9.2%,  Coloured  at 8.9%, and  Indian or Asian  at 2.5%. [ 53 ]  Even though the population of South Africa has increased in the past decade [ 52 ] [ 54 ]  (primarily due to immigration), the country had an annual population growth rate of 0.501% in 2008 (CIA est.), including immigration. [ 55 ]  South Africa is home to an estimated 5 million  illegal immigrants , including some 3 million  Zimbabweans . [ 56 ] [ 57 ] [ 58 ]  A series of  anti-immigrant riots  occurred in South Africa beginning on 11 May 2008. [ 59 ] [ 60 ]   By far the major part of the population classified itself as African or black, but it is not culturally or linguistically homogeneous. Major ethnic groups include the  Zulu ,  Xhosa ,  Basotho  (South Sotho),  Bapedi  (North Sotho),  Venda ,  Tswana ,  Tsonga ,  Swazi  and  Ndebele , all of which speak  Bantu languages  (see  Bantu peoples of South Africa ).   Some, such as the Zulu, Xhosa, Bapedi and Venda groups, are unique to South Africa. Other groups are distributed across the borders with neighbours of South Africa: The  Basotho  group is also the major ethnic group in  Lesotho . The  Tswana  ethnic group constitute the majority of the population of  Botswana . The  Swazi  ethnic group is the major ethnic group in  Swaziland . The  Ndebele  ethnic group is also found in  Matabeleland  in  Zimbabwe , where they are known as the  Matabele . These Ndebele people are the descendants of a Zulu faction under the warrior  Mzilikazi  that escaped persecution from  Shaka  by migrating to their current territory. The  Tsonga  ethnic group is also found in southern  Mozambique , where they are known as the Shangaan.   The white population is not ethnically homogeneous and descend from many ethnic groups:  Dutch ,  Flemish ,  Portuguese , German, French  Huguenot , English, Irish, Italian, Scottish and  Welsh . Culturally and linguistically, they are divided into the  Afrikaners , who speak  Afrikaans , and English-speaking groups, many of whom are descended from British and Irish immigrants (see  Anglo-African ). Many small communities that have immigrated over the last century retain the use of other languages. The  white population  is on the decrease due to a low birth rate and emigration; as a factor in their decision to emigrate, many cite the high  crime  rate and the  affirmative action  policies of the government. Since 1994, approximately 1 000 000 white South Africans have permanently emigrated. [ 61 ] [ 62 ] [ 63 ] [ 64 ]  Despite high emigration levels, a high level of non-South African white immigrants have settled in the country, in particular from countries such as  Britain  and  Zimbabwe . For example, by 2005, an estimated 212 000 British citizens were residing in South Africa. Since 2003, the numbers of British migrants coming to South Africa has risen by 50%. An estimated 20 000 British migrants moved to South Africa in 2007. There have also been a significant number of  white Zimbabwean  arrivals, fleeing their home country in light of the economic and political problems currently facing the country. As well as recent arrivals, a significant number of white Zimbabweans emigrated to South Africa in the wake of independence in Zimbabwe in 1980. Some of the more nostalgic members of the community are known in popular culture as "" Whenwes "", because of their nostalgia for their lives in  Rhodesia  ""when we were in Rhodesia"". [ 65 ]   The term  Coloured  is still largely used for the people of mixed race descended from slaves brought in from East and Central Africa, the indigenous  Khoisan  who lived in the  Cape  at the time, Bantus, Whites (mostly the  Dutch / Afrikaner  and British settlers) as well as an admixture of  Javanese ,  Malay , Indian,  Malagasy  and Asian blood (such as  Burmese ). The majority speak Afrikaans. Khoisan is a term used to describe two separate groups, physically similar: light-skinned and small in stature. The  Khoikhoi , who were called  Hottentots  by the Europeans, were pastoralists and were annihilated; the San, called  Bushmen  by the Europeans, were hunter-gatherers. Within the Coloured community, more recent immigrants will also be found: Coloureds from the former  Rhodesia  (now  Zimbabwe );  Namibia  and immigrants of mixed descent from India and  Burma  ( Anglo-Indians / Anglo-Burmese ) who were welcomed to the Cape when India and Burma received their Independence.   The major part of the South African  Asian  population is Indian in origin (see  Indian South Africans ); many of them descended from indentured workers brought in the nineteenth century to work on the  sugar   plantations  of the eastern coastal area then known as  Natal . There is also a significant group of  Chinese South Africans  (approximately 100,000 individuals) and  Vietnamese  South Africans (approximately 50,000 individuals). In 2008, the Pretoria High Court has ruled that Chinese South Africans who arrived before 1994 are to be reclassified as  Coloureds . As a result of this ruling, about 12,000 - 15,000  [ 66 ] ethnically Chinese citizens who arrived before 1994, numbering 3%-5% of the total Chinese population in the country, will be able to benefit from government  BEE  policies. [ 67 ]   South Africa hosts a sizeable refugee and asylum seeker population. According to the  World Refugee Survey 2008 , published by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, this population numbered approximately 144,700 in 2007. [ 68 ]  Groups of refugees and asylum seekers numbering over 10,000 included people from  Zimbabwe  (48,400), The  Democratic Republic of the Congo  (24,800), and  Somalia  (12,900). [ 68 ]  These populations mainly lived in Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban, Cape Town, and Port Elizabeth. [ 68 ]     Science and technology   Several important scientific and technological developments have originated in South Africa.  The first human to human heart transplant was performed by cardiac surgeon  Christiaan Barnard  at  Groote Schuur Hospital  in December 1967  .  Max Theiler  developed a vaccine against Yellow Fever,  Allan McLeod Cormack  pioneered x-ray  Computed tomography , and  Aaron Klug  developed crystallographic electron microscopy techniques. These advancements were all recognised with  Nobel Prizes .  Sydney Brenner  won most recently, in 2002, for his pioneering work in  molecular biology .   Mark Shuttleworth  founded an early Internet security company  Thawte , that was subsequently bought out by world-leader  VeriSign . Despite government efforts to encourage entrepreneurship in biotechnology, IT and other high technology fields, no other notable groundbreaking companies have been founded in South Africa. However, it is the expressed objective of the government to transition the economy to be more reliant on high technology, based on the realisation that South African cannot compete with Far Eastern economies in manufacturing, nor can the republic rely on its mineral wealth in perpetuity.   South Africa has cultivated a burgeoning astronomy community. It hosts the  Southern African Large Telescope , the largest optical telescope in the southern hemisphere. South Africa is currently building the  Karoo Array Telescope  as a pathfinder for the $20 billion  Square Kilometer Array  project. South Africa is a finalist, with Australia, to be the host of the SKA.     Society and culture   Main article:  Culture of South Africa          Decorated houses,  Drakensberg Mountains              Traditional  South African cuisine .       It may be argued that there is no ""single"" culture in South Africa because of its ethnic diversity. Today, the diversity in foods from many cultures is enjoyed by all and especially marketed to tourists who wish to sample the large variety of South African cuisine. In addition to  food ,  music  and  dance  feature prominently.   South African cuisine  is heavily  meat-based  and has spawned the distinctively South African social gathering known as a  braai , or barbecue. South Africa has also developed into a major  wine  producer, with some of the best  vineyards  lying in valleys around  Stellenbosch ,  Franschoek ,  Paarl  and  Barrydale . [ 69 ]   There is great diversity in music from South Africa. Many black musicians who sang in Afrikaans or English during apartheid have since begun to sing in traditional African languages, and have developed a unique style called  Kwaito . Of note is  Brenda Fassie , who launched to fame with her song ""Weekend Special"", which was sung in English. More famous traditional musicians include  Ladysmith Black Mambazo , while the  Soweto String Quartet  performs classic music with an African flavour. White and Coloured South African singers are historically influenced by European musical styles including such western metal bands such as  Seether  (formerly Saron Gas). South Africa has produced world-famous jazz musicians, notably  Hugh Masekela ,  Jonas Gwangwa ,  Abdullah Ibrahim ,  Miriam Makeba ,  Jonathan Butler ,  Chris McGregor , and  Sathima Bea Benjamin .  Afrikaans  music covers multiple genres, such as the  contemporary   Steve Hofmeyr  and the  punk rock  band  Fokofpolisiekar . Crossover artists such as  Johnny Clegg  and his bands  Juluka  and  Savuka  have enjoyed various success underground, publicly, and abroad.   The South African black majority still has a substantial number of rural inhabitants who lead largely impoverished lives. It is among these people, however, that cultural traditions survive most strongly; as blacks have become increasingly  urbanised  and  westernised , aspects of traditional culture have declined. Urban blacks usually speak English or  Afrikaans  in addition to their native tongue. There are smaller but still significant groups of speakers of  Khoisan languages  who are not included in the eleven official languages, but are one of the eight other officially recognised languages. There are small groups of speakers of  endangered languages , most of which are from the Khoi-San family, that receive no official status; however, some groups within South Africa are attempting to promote their use and revival.   The  middle class  lifestyle, predominantly of the white minority but with growing numbers of Black, Coloured and Indian people, [ 70 ]  is similar in many respects to that of people found in  Western Europe , North America and  Australasia . Members of the middle class often study and work abroad for greater exposure to the markets of the world.   Asians , predominantly of Indian origin, preserve their own cultural heritage, languages and religious beliefs, being either  Christian ,  Hindu  or  Sunni Muslim  and speaking English, with Indian languages like  Hindi ,  Telugu ,  Tamil  or  Gujarati  being spoken less frequently, but the majority of Indians being able to understand their mother tongue. The first Indians arrived on the famous  Truro ship  as  indentured labourers  in Natal to work the Sugar Cane Fields. There is a much smaller  Chinese  community in South Africa, although its numbers have increased due to immigration from  Republic of China  (Taiwan).   South Africa has also had a large influence in the  Scouting  movement, with many Scouting traditions and ceremonies coming from the experiences of  Robert Baden-Powell  (the founder of Scouting) during his time in South Africa as a military officer in the 1890s. The  South African Scout Association  was one of the first youth organisations to open its doors to youth and adults of all races in South Africa. This happened on 2 July 1977 at a conference known as  Quo Vadis . [ 71 ]   The South African music scene consists of  Kwaito , a new music genre that had developed in the mid 80s and has since developed to become the most popular social economical form of representation among the populous. Though some may argue that the political aspects of Kwaito has since diminished after  Apartheid , and the relative interest in politics has become a minor aspect of daily life. Some argue that in a sense,  Kwaito  is in fact a political force that shows activism in its apolitical actions. Today, major corporations like  Sony ,  BMG , and  EMI  have appeared on the South African scene to produce and distribute  Kwaito  music. Due to its overwhelming popularity, as well as the general influence of DJs, who are among the top 5 most influential types of people within the country,  Kwaito  has taken over radio, television, and magazines. [ 72 ]   Kwaito , much like most hip-hop has its own local flavor and originality. However, unlike when hip-hop first burst on the scene as a politically driven and rebellious underground movement, South Africans wanted to create a happier vibe. As the post-apartheid fog cleared, South African youth found their ""own voice in a style of music known as kwaito, spawning a new (and profitable) industry"". [ 73 ]  According to TIMEeurope magazine, ""The kwaito sound now regularly incorporates traditional African music, jazz, gospel, and even rock guitar, most notably on Mandoza's 2000 hit Nkalakatha, one of the few kwaito records to cross over onto traditionally white radio"". [ 74 ]  In the kwaito, the samples from old school  Jamaican dancehall , European house, etc.,  tempos  are changed, beats are added, and urban street slang is also incorporated. This local flavour of music more recently has been attacked for its lack of ingenuity and its betrayal of its roots. The melodies and the incorporation of sex and dance have since become very similar to the American standard. In addition Kwaito has been criticised for its absence of influential lyrical content. As Kwaito is still a developing genre, and since the South African population is only around 48 million, sales of only 25,000 CDs are required for ""gold"" certification in South Africa. [ 73 ]     Religion   Main article:  Religion in South Africa           St. Mark 's Anglican Cathedral.       According to the latest 2001 national census, Christians accounted for 79.7% of the population. This includes  Zion Christian  11.1%,  Pentecostal  ( Charismatic ) 8.2%,  Roman Catholic  7.1%,  Methodist  6.8%,  Dutch Reformed  6.7%,  Anglican  3.8%, and other Christian 36%.  Islam  accounted for 1.5% of the population,  Hinduism  about 1.3%, and  Judaism  0.2%. 15.1% had no religious affiliation, 2.3% were other and 1.4% were unspecified. [ 75 ] [ 76 ]   African Indigenous Churches were the largest of the  Christian  groups. It was believed that many of these persons who claimed no affiliation with any organised religion adhered to  traditional indigenous religions . Many peoples have  syncretic  religious practices combining Christian and indigenous influences. [ 77 ]   Islam in South Africa  itself is not known to pre-date the colonial period, despite the isolated contact neighbouring  Mozambique  had with  Arab  and  East African  traders. [ citation needed ]  There is no evidence that Islam was known to the  Zulu ,  Swazi , or  Xhosa  of the east coast prior to the colonial era. Many South African Muslims are described as  Coloureds , notably in the  Western Cape , especially those whose ancestors came as slaves from the Indonesian archipelago (the  Cape Malays ). Others are described as  Indians , notably in  KwaZulu-Natal , including those whose ancestors came as traders from  South Asia ; they have been joined by others from other parts of Africa as well as white or black South African converts. It is estimated that  Islam  is the fastest growing religion of conversion in the country, [ 78 ]  with the number of black  Muslims  growing sixfold, from 12,000 in 1991 to 74,700 in 2004. [ 79 ]   Hinduism  dates back to British Colonial period primarily but later waves of continuous immigrants from India have contributed to a sizeable Hindu population. Most Hindus are ethnically South Asian but there are many who come from mixed racial stock and many are converts with the efforts of Hindu missionaries such as ISKCON. Other religions in smaller numbers are  Sikhism ,  Jainism  and  Bah' Faith . [ 76 ]     Languages   Main article:  Languages of South Africa          Map showing principal South African languages by municipality. Lighter shades indicate a non-majority  plurality .             Afrikaans          Northern Sotho          Southern Sotho          Swati          Tsonga            Tswana          Venda          Xhosa          Zulu               South Africa has eleven  official languages : [ 80 ]   Sepedi ,  Sesotho ,  Setswana ,  siSwati ,  Tshivenda ,  Xitsonga ,  Afrikaans ,  English ,  isiNdebele ,  isiXhosa  and  isiZulu . In this regard it is  second only to India  in number. While each language is formally equal to every other, some languages are spoken more than others. According to the 2001 National Census, the three most spoken first home languages are Zulu (23.8%), Xhosa (17.6%) and Afrikaans (13.3%). [ 52 ]  Despite the fact that English is recognised as the language of commerce and science, it was spoken by only 8.2% of South Africans at home in 2001, an even lower percentage than in 1996 (8.6%). [ 52 ]   There are  eleven official names  for South Africa, one in each of the official national languages. The country also recognises eight non-official languages:  Fanagalo ,  Khoe ,  Lobedu ,  Nama ,  Northern Ndebele ,  Phuthi ,  San  and  South African Sign Language . [ citation needed ]  These non-official languages may be used in certain official uses in limited areas where it has been determined that these languages are prevalent. Nevertheless, their populations are not such that they require nationwide recognition.   Many of the ""unofficial languages"" of the  San  and  Khoikhoi  people contain regional  dialects  stretching northward into Namibia and Botswana, and elsewhere. These people, who are a physically distinct population from other Africans, have their own cultural identity based on their  hunter-gatherer  societies. They have been marginalised to a great extent, and many of their languages are in danger of becoming  extinct .   Many white South Africans also speak other European languages, such as  Portuguese  (also spoken by Angolan and Mozambican blacks), German, and  Greek , while some  Asians  and  Indians  in South Africa speak  South Asian  languages, such as  Tamil ,  Hindi ,  Gujarati ,  Urdu  and  Telugu .  French  is still widely spoken by French South Africans especially in places like  Franschhoek , where many South Africans are of French origin. South African French is spoken by less than 10,000 individuals. Congolese French is also spoken in South Africa by migrants.

It also hosted the  2003 Cricket World Cup  and the  2007 World Twenty20 Championship . South Africa will be the host nation for the  2010 FIFA World Cup , which will be the first time the tournament is held on the African continent.   In 2004, the swim team of  Roland Schoeman ,  Lyndon Ferns ,  Darian Townsend  and  Ryk Neethling  won the gold medal at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, simultaneously breaking the world record in the 4x100 freestyle relay.  Penny Heyns  won Olympic Gold in the 1996  Atlanta Olympic Games .   In golf,  Gary Player  is generally regarded as one of the greatest golfers of all time, having won the  Career Grand Slam , one of five golfers to have done so. Other South African golfers to have successfully won a major tournament include  Bobby Locke ,  Ernie Els ,  Retief Goosen  and  Trevor Immelman .     Current issues     HIV/AIDS   Main article:  HIV/AIDS in South Africa   The spread of  AIDS  (acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome) is an alarming problem in South Africa with up to 31% of pregnant women found to be HIV infected in 2005 and the infection rate among adults estimated at 20%. [ 81 ]  The link between HIV, a virus spread primarily by sexual contact, and AIDS was long denied by prior president  Thabo Mbeki  and then health minister  Manto Tshabalala-Msimang , who insisted that the many deaths in the country are due to malnutrition, and hence poverty, and not HIV. [ 82 ]  In 2007, in response to international pressure, the government made efforts to fight AIDS. [ 83 ]  In September 2008 Thabo Mbeki was ousted by the ANC and  Kgalema Motlanthe  was appointed for the interim. One of Mr. Motlanthe's first actions was to replace Mrs. Tshabalala-Msimang with the current minister,  Barbara Hogan .   AIDS affects mainly those who are sexually active and is far more prevalent in the black population. Most deaths are people who are also economically active, resulting in many families losing their primary wage earners. This has resulted in many 'AIDS orphans' who in many cases depend on the state for care and financial support. [ 84 ]  It is estimated that there are 1,200,000 orphans in South Africa. [ 84 ]  Many elderly people also lose the support from lost younger members of their family. Roughly 5 million people are infected with the disease. [ 83 ]     Crime   Main article:  Crime in South Africa           Prison  buildings on  Robben Island       According to a survey for the period 19982000 compiled by the  United Nations , South Africa was ranked second for  murder  and first for  assaults  and  rapes  per capita. [ 85 ]  Total crime per capita is 10th out of the 60 countries in the data set.   Crime  has had a pronounced effect on society: many middle-class South Africans moved into  gated communities , abandoning the central business districts of some cities for the relative security of suburbs. This effect is most pronounced in  Johannesburg , although the trend is noticeable in other cities as well. [ citation needed ]  Many emigrants from South Africa also state that crime was a big motivator for them to leave.  Crime against the farming community  has continued to be a major problem. [ 86 ]     Skills migration   Along with many African nations, South Africa has been experiencing a "" brain drain "" in the past 20 years. This is believed to be potentially damaging for the regional economy, [ 87 ]  and is almost certainly detrimental for the well-being of the majority of people reliant on the healthcare infrastructure, given the HIV/AIDS epidemic. [ 88 ]  The skills drain in South Africa tends to demonstrate racial contours (naturally given the skills distribution legacy of South Africa) and has thus resulted in large white South African communities abroad. [ 89 ]     Xenophobia   Main article:  Xenophobia in South Africa   In May 2008 long standing state hostility to African migrants exploded in a series of pogroms that left up to 100 people dead and 100,000 displaced.

The South African coast stretches 2,798 kilometres (1,739 mi) [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  and borders both the  Atlantic  and  Indian   oceans . [ 7 ]  To the north of South Africa lie  Namibia ,  Botswana  and  Zimbabwe , to the east are  Mozambique  and  Swaziland , while the  Kingdom of Lesotho  is an independent  enclave  surrounded by South African territory. [ 8 ]   Modern human beings have inhabited South Africa for more than 100,000 years. [ 9 ]  A century and a half after the discovery of the  Cape Sea Route , the  Dutch East India Company   founded  a refreshment station at what would become  Cape Town  in 1652. [ 10 ]  Cape Town became a British colony in 1806. European settlement expanded during the 1820s as the  Boers  (original  Dutch ,  Flemish ,  German  and  French  settlers) and the British  1820 Settlers  claimed land in the north and east of the country. Conflicts arose among the Xhosa, Zulu and Afrikaner groups. However, the discovery of diamonds and later gold triggered the conflict known as the  Anglo-Boer War  as the Boers and the British fought for the control of the South African mineral wealth. Although the Boers were defeated, limited independence was given to South Africa in 1910 as a British dominion. Anti-British policies focused on ultimate independence which was achieved in 1961 when South Africa was declared a  republic . The leading  National Party  legislated for a continuation of racial segregation begun under Dutch and British colonial rule, Boer republics, and subsequent South African governments (and which in 1948 became legally institutionalised  segregation  known as  apartheid ), despite opposition both in and outside of the country. In 1990 the then president  F.W. de Klerk  began to dismantle this legislation, and in 1994 the first democratic election was held in South Africa. This election brought  Nelson Mandela  and the current ruling party, the  African National Congress  to power, and the country rejoined the  Commonwealth of Nations .   South Africa is known for its diversity in cultures, languages, and religious beliefs, and eleven official languages are recognised in its  constitution . [ 7 ]  English is the most commonly spoken language in official and commercial public life, however it is only the fifth most spoken home language. [ 7 ]  South Africa is ethnically diverse, with the largest  Caucasian ,  Indian , and  racially mixed  communities in Africa. Although 79.6% of the South African population is  Black , [ 2 ]  this category is neither culturally nor linguistically homogeneous, as people within this classification speak a number of different  Bantu languages , nine of which have official status. [ 7 ]  Midyear 2007, the South African population was estimated at 47.9 million.

(September 2008)       Main article:  History of South Africa   South Africa contains some of the oldest archaeological sites in the world. [ 11 ]   [ 12 ]  Extensive fossil remains at the  Sterkfontein ,  Kromdraai  and Makapansgat caves suggest that various  australopithecines  existed in South Africa from about three million years ago. [ 13 ]  These were succeeded by various species of  Homo , including  Homo habilis ,  Homo erectus  and modern humans,  Homo sapiens . Settlements of  Bantu -speaking peoples, who were  iron -using agriculturists and herdsmen, were already present south of the  Limpopo River  by the fourth or fifth century (see  Bantu expansion ) displacing and absorbing the original  KhoiSan  speakers. They slowly moved south and the earliest ironworks in modern-day  KwaZulu-Natal Province  are believed to date from around 1050. The southernmost group was the  Xhosa  people, whose language incorporates certain linguistic traits from the earlier KhoiSan people, reaching the  Fish River , in today's  Eastern Cape Province . These  Iron Age  populations displaced earlier people, who often had  hunter-gatherer  societies, as they migrated.     European colonisation          Painting of an account of the arrival of  Jan van Riebeeck , the first  European  to settle in South Africa, with  Devil's Peak  in the background       In 1487, the  Portuguese  explorer  Bartolomeu Dias  became the first European to reach the southernmost point of Africa. Initially named The Cape of Storms, The King of Portugal,  John II , renamed it the  Cabo da Boa Esperana  or  Cape of Good Hope  as it led to the riches of India. This great feat of navigation was later immortalised in  Cames ' epic Portuguese poem,  The Lusiads  (1572). In 1652, a refreshment station was established at the  Cape of Good Hope  by  Jan van Riebeeck  on behalf of the  Dutch East India Company .  Slaves  were brought from  Indonesia ,  Madagascar , and India as a labour source for the Dutch immigrants in  Cape Town . As they expanded east, the Dutch settlers eventually met the south-westerly expanding  Xhosa  people in the region of the  Fish River . A series of wars, called the  Cape Frontier Wars , ensued, mainly caused by conflicting land and livestock interests.   Great Britain  took over the  Cape of Good Hope  area in 1795 ostensibly to stop it falling into the hands of the Revolutionary French, but also seeking to use  Cape Town  in particular as a stop on the route to Australia and India. It was later returned to the Dutch in 1803, but soon afterwards the  Dutch East India Company  declared bankruptcy, and the British annexed the Cape Colony in 1806. The British continued the frontier wars against the Xhosa, pushing the eastern frontier eastward through a line of forts established along the Fish River and consolidating it by encouraging  British settlement . Due to pressure of  abolitionist  societies in Britain, the  British parliament  first stopped its global  slave trade  with the passage of the  Slave Trade Act 1807 , then abolished slavery in all its colonies with the  Slavery Abolition Act 1833 . During the 1830s, approximately 12 000  Boers  (later known as  Voortrekkers ), departed from the  Cape Colony , where they were subjected to British control, to the future Natal, Orange Free State and Transvaal regions. The Boers founded the  Boer Republics  - the  South African Republic  (Now  Gauteng ,  Limpopo ,  Mpumalanga  and  North West  provinces) and the  Orange Free State  ( Free State ).   The discovery of  diamonds  in 1867 and  gold  in 1884 in the interior encouraged economic growth and immigration, intensifying the subjugation of the indigenous people. These important economic resources did not only play a role between European and the indigenous population but also between the Boers and the British. [ 14 ]   The  Boer Republics  successfully resisted British encroachments during the  First Boer War  (18801881) using  guerrilla warfare  tactics, much better suited to local conditions. However, the British returned in greater numbers, more experience, and more suitable tactics in the  Second Boer War  (18991902). The Boers' attempt to ally themselves with  German South-West Africa  provided the British with yet another excuse to take control of the Boer Republics. [ citation needed ]           Boers  in combat (1881).         Independence   After four years of negotiating, the  Union of South Africa  was created from the  Cape  and  Natal  colonies, as well as the republics of  Orange Free State  and  Transvaal , on 31 May 1910, exactly eight years after the end of the Second Boer War. The newly created Union of South Africa was a  dominion . The  Natives' Land Act  of 1913 severely restricted the ownership of land by 'blacks', at that stage to a mere 7% of the country, although this amount was eventually increased marginally. [ 15 ]  The union was effectively granted independence from the United Kingdom with the passage of the  Statute of Westminster , which morphed the  British king's  position within South Africa into that of the distinct  King of South Africa . In 1934, the  South African Party  and  National Party  merged to form the  United Party , seeking reconciliation between Afrikaners and English-speaking ""Whites"", but split in 1939 over the entry of the Union into  World War II  as an ally of the United Kingdom, a move which the National Party strongly opposed.   In 1948, the  National Party  was elected to power, and intensified the implementation of racial segregation that had begun under Dutch and British colonial rule, and subsequent South African governments since the Union was formed. The Nationalist Government systematised existing segregationist laws, and the system of segregation became known collectively as  apartheid . Not surprisingly, this segregation also applied to the wealth acquired during rapid industrialisation of the 1950s, '60s, and '70s. While the White minority enjoyed the highest  standard of living  in all of Africa, often comparable to  First World  western nations, the Black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard, including income, education, housing, and life expectancy. On 31 May 1961, following a whites-only  referendum , the country became a  republic  and left the (British)  Commonwealth . The office of  Governor-General  was abolished and replaced with the position of  State President .   Apartheid became increasingly controversial, leading to widespread  sanctions ,  divestment  and growing unrest and oppression within South Africa. (See also the article on the  History of South Africa in the apartheid era .) A long period of harsh suppression by the government, and at times violent resistance,  strikes , marches, protests, and  sabotage  by bombing and other means, by various anti-apartheid movements, most notably the  African National Congress  (ANC), followed. In the late 1970s, South Africa began a programme of  nuclear weapons  development and in the following decade it produced six deliverable nuclear weapons. The rationale for the nuclear arsenal is disputed, but it is believed [ who? ]  that  Vorster  and  P.W. Botha  wanted to be able to catalyse American intervention in the event of a war between South Africa and the  Cuban -supported  MPLA  government of  Angola .     Democracy   In 1990 the  National Party  government took the first step towards negotiating itself out of power when it lifted the ban on the  African National Congress  and other  left-wing  political organisations, and released  Nelson Mandela  from prison after twenty-seven years' incarceration on a  sabotage  sentence. Apartheid legislation was gradually removed from the statute books, and South Africa also destroyed its nuclear arsenal and acceded to the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . The first  multi-racial elections  were held in 1994, which the ANC won by an overwhelming majority. It has been in power ever since.   In  post-apartheid South Africa , millions of South Africans, mostly black, continued to live in  poverty , though poverty among whites, previously rare, has increased greatly. [ 16 ]  While some have partly attributed this to the legacy of the apartheid system, increasingly many attribute it to the failure of the current government to tackle social issues, coupled with the monetary and fiscal discipline of the current government to ensure both redistribution of wealth and economic growth. Since the ANC-led government took power, the  United Nations   Human Development Index  of South Africa has fallen, while it was steadily rising until the mid-1990s. [ 17 ]  Some of this could possibly be attributed to the  AIDS   pandemic  and the failure of the government to take steps to address it, [ 18 ] some of it can also be pinpointed to a government policy of  redistribution of wealth . As a mitigating factor, the social housing policy of the current government has produced an improvement in living conditions.     Politics   Main articles:  Politics of South Africa ,  Government of South Africa , and  Law of South Africa          The  Union Buildings  in  Pretoria  is the home of the South African executive.       South Africa has three capital cities:  Cape Town , the largest of the three, is the  legislative  capital;  Pretoria  is the  administrative  capital; and  Bloemfontein  is the  judicial  capital. South Africa has a  bicameral   parliament : the  National Council of Provinces  (the  upper house ) has 90 members, while the  National Assembly  (the  lower house ) has 400 members. Members of the lower house are elected on a population basis by  proportional representation : half of the members are elected from national lists and the other half are elected from provincial lists. Ten members are elected to represent each province in the National Council of Provinces, regardless of the population of the province. Elections for both chambers are held every five years. The government is formed in the lower house, and the leader of the majority party in the National Assembly is the  President .   The primary sources of South Africa law are Roman-Dutch mercantile law and personal law with English Common law, as imports of Dutch settlements and  British colonialism . [ 19 ]  The first European based law in South Africa was brought by the  Dutch East India Company  and is called  Roman-Dutch law . It was imported before the  codification  of European law into the  Napoleonic Code  and is comparable in many ways to  Scots law . This was followed in the 19th century by  English law , both  common  and  statutory . Starting in 1910 with unification, South Africa had its own  parliament  which passed laws specific for South Africa, building on those previously passed for the individual member colonies.   Current South African politics are dominated by the  African National Congress  (ANC), which received 69.7% of the vote during the last  2004 general election  and 66.3% of the vote in the  2006 municipal election . The current  President of South Africa  is  Kgalema Motlanthe , who replaced  Thabo Mbeki  on 25 September 2008. Mbeki succeeded former President  Nelson Mandela  in 1999, and was re-elected for a second five year term in 2004, but announced his resignation on 20 September 2008.   The main challenger to the rule of the ANC is the  Democratic Alliance  party, which received 12.4% of the vote in the 2004 election and 14.8% in the 2006 election.  Helen Zille , (elected 6 May 2007), is the party leader; the previous leader was  Tony Leon . The formerly dominant  New National Party , which introduced apartheid through its predecessor, the  National Party , chose to merge with the ANC on 9 April 2005. Other major political parties represented in Parliament are the  Inkatha Freedom Party , which mainly represents  Zulu  voters, and the  Independent Democrats , who took 6.97% and 1.7% of the vote respectively, in the 2004 election.   Since 2004, the country has had many thousands of popular protests, some violent, making it, according to one academic, the ""most protest-rich country in the world"". [ 20 ]  Many of these protests have been organised from the growing  shanty towns  that surround South African cities.     Foreign relations and military   Main articles:  South African National Defence Force ,  Foreign relations of South Africa , and  South Africa and weapons of mass destruction   Since the end of apartheid, the South African foreign policy has focused on its African partners particularly in the  Southern African Development Community  (SADC) and the  African Union . South Africa has played a key role as a mediator in African conflicts over the last decade, such as in  Burundi , the  Democratic Republic of Congo , the  Comoros , and  Zimbabwe . After apartheid ended, South Africa was readmitted to the  Commonwealth of Nations . As the  Union of South Africa , South Africa was a founding member of the  United Nations  and the then Prime Minister  Jan Smuts  wrote the preamble to its constitution. South Africa is currently a non-permanent member of the  United Nations Security Council  and has attracted controversy by voting against a resolution criticising the  Burmese  government in 2006 and against the implementation of sanctions against  Zimbabwe  in 2008. South Africa is a member of the  Group of 77  and chaired the organisation in 2006. South Africa is a member of the  South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone ,  Southern African Customs Union ,  World Trade Organization ,  International Monetary Fund ,  G20  and  G8+5 .   The South African  armed forces , known as the  South African National Defence Force  (SANDF), was created in 1994. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  Previously known as the  South African Defence Force  (SADF), the new force is an all volunteer army and consists of the forces of the old SADF, as well as the forces of the African nationalist groups, namely  Umkhonto we Sizwe  (MK),  Azanian People's Liberation Army  (APLA), and the former  Bantustan  defence forces. [ 21 ]  The SANDF is subdivided into four branches, the  South African Army , the  South African Air Force , the  South African Navy , and the  South African Military Health Services . [ 23 ]   In recent years, the SANDF has become a major  peacekeeping  force in Africa, [ 24 ]  and has been involved in operations in  Lesotho , the  Democratic Republic of the Congo , [ 24 ]  and  Burundi , [ 24 ]  amongst others. It has also participated as a part of multi-national  UN  peacekeeping forces.   South Africa undertook a nuclear weapons programme in the 1970s [ 25 ]  and  may have conducted  a nuclear test over the  Atlantic  in 1979. [ 26 ]  It is the only African country to have successfully  developed nuclear weapons . It has become the first country (followed by Ukraine) with nuclear capability to voluntarily renounce and dismantle its programme and in the process signed the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty  in 1991. [ 25 ]     Provinces, districts and municipalities   Main articles:  Provinces of South Africa ,  Districts of South Africa , and  Municipalities of South Africa          Map showing the provinces and districts (numbered) of South Africa.             Northern Cape          North West          Gauteng          Limpopo          Mpumalanga            KwaZulu-Natal          Eastern Cape          Free State          Western Cape               When apartheid ended in 1994, the South African government had to integrate the formerly independent and semi-independent  Bantustans  into the political structure of South Africa. To this end, it abolished the four former provinces of South Africa ( Cape Province ,  Natal ,  Orange Free State , and  Transvaal ) and replaced them with nine fully integrated provinces. The new provinces are usually much smaller than the former provinces, which theoretically gives local governments more resources to distribute over smaller areas.   The nine provinces are further subdivided into  52 districts :  6 metropolitan  and  46 district municipalities . The 46 district municipalities are further subdivided into  231 local municipalities . The district municipalities also contain 20 district management areas (mostly game parks) that are directly governed by the district municipalities. The six metropolitan municipalities perform the functions of both district and local municipalities.

At 470,979  sq mi  (1,219,912 km), [ 27 ]  South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world (after  Mali ). It is comparable in size to  Colombia .  Njesuthi  in the  Drakensberg  at 3,408 m (11,424 ft) is the highest peak in South Africa.          View of the  Drakensberg mountains , the highest mountain range in South Africa.       South Africa has a generally  temperate climate , due in part to it being surrounded by the  Atlantic  and  Indian Oceans  on three sides, by its location in the climatically milder  southern hemisphere  and due to the average elevation rising steadily towards the north (towards the  equator ) and further inland. Due to this varied topography and oceanic influence, a great variety of climatic zones exist.   The climatic zones vary, from the extreme  desert  of the southern  Namib  in the farthest northwest to the lush  subtropical  climate in the east along the  Mozambique  border and the  Indian  ocean. From the east, the land quickly rises over a  mountainous   escarpment  towards the interior  plateau  known as the  Highveld . Even though South Africa is classified as  semi-arid , there is considerable variation in  climate  as well as  topography .   The interior of South Africa is a vast, rather flat, and sparsely populated  scrubland ,  Karoo , which is drier towards the northwest along the Namib desert. In contrast, the eastern coastline is lush and well-watered, which produces a climate similar to the tropics. The extreme southwest has a climate remarkably similar to that of the  Mediterranean  with wet winters and hot, dry summers, hosting the famous  Fynbos   Biome . This area also produces much of the  wine  in South Africa. This region is also particularly known for its wind, which blows intermittently almost all year. The severity of this wind made passing around the  Cape of Good Hope  particularly treacherous for sailors, causing many  shipwrecks . Further east on the south coast, rainfall is distributed more evenly throughout the year, producing a green landscape. This area is popularly known as the  Garden Route .          Satellite picture of South Africa       The  Free State  is particularly flat due to the fact that it lies centrally on the high plateau. North of the  Vaal River , the Highveld becomes better watered and does not experience subtropical extremes of heat.  Johannesburg , in the centre of the Highveld, is at 1,740 metres (5,709 ft) and receives an annual rainfall of 760 millimetres (30  in ). Winters in this region are cold, although  snow  is rare.   To the north of Johannesburg, the altitude drops beyond the escarpment of the Highveld, and turns into the lower lying Bushveld, an area of mixed dry forest and an abundance of wildlife. East of the Highveld, beyond the eastern escarpment, the Lowveld stretches towards the  Indian  ocean. It has particularly high temperatures, and is also the location of extended subtropical agriculture.   The high  Drakensberg mountains , which form the south-eastern escarpment of the Highveld, offer limited  skiing  opportunities in winter. The coldest place in South Africa is  Sutherland  in the western  Roggeveld Mountains , where midwinter temperatures can reach as low as 15 degrees  Celsius  (5  F ). The deep interior has the hottest temperatures: A temperature of 51.7 C (125 F) was recorded in 1948 in the  Northern Cape  Kalahari near  Upington . [ 28 ]   South Africa also has one possession, the small sub-Antarctic archipelago of the  Prince Edward Islands , consisting of  Marion Island  (290 km/112 sq mi) and Prince Edward Island (45 km/17.3 sq mi) (not to be confused with the  Canadian province of the same name ).           Weather averages for Cape Town, South Africa         Month   Jan   Feb   Mar   Apr   May   Jun   Jul   Aug   Sep   Oct   Nov   Dec   Year       Average high C (F)   27  (81)   28  (82)   26  (79)   24  (75)   20  (68)   18  (64)   17  (63)   18  (64)   19  (66)   22  (72)   24  (75)   26  (79)   28  (82)       Average low C (F)   16  (61)   16  (61)   15  (59)   13  (55)   10  (50)   8  (46)   8  (46)   8  (46)   9  (48)   11  (52)   14  (57)   15  (59)   8  (46)       Precipitation  mm (inches)   16.5  (0.65)   13  (0.51)   20  (0.79)   54  (2.13)   92  (3.62)   111  (4.37)   96  (3.78)   87  (3.43)   56  (2.2)   40  (1.57)   24  (0.94)   18  (0.71)   627  (24.69)       Source: EuroWEATHER [ 29 ]  2008-02-22         Flora and fauna   See also:  Wildlife of South Africa   See also:  Protected areas of South Africa           Fynbos , a  floral kingdom  unique to South Africa, is found near  Cape Town               Swartberg  mountains near the town of  Oudtshoorn              A field of flowers in Weskus National Park.       South Africa is one of only 17 countries worldwide considered  megadiverse . It has more than 20,000 different  plants , or about 10% of all the known  species  of plants on  Earth , making it particularly rich in plant biodiversity. South Africa is the 6th most biodiverse country, [ 30 ]  after  Brazil ,  Colombia ,  Indonesia ,  China , and  Mexico . The most prevalent biome in South Africa is the  grassland , particularly on the  Highveld , where the plant cover is dominated by different  grasses , low  shrubs , and  acacia trees , mainly camel-thorn and whitethorn.  Vegetation  becomes even more sparse towards the northwest due to low  rainfall . There are several species of water-storing  succulents  like  aloes  and euphorbias in the very hot and dry  Namaqualand  area. The grass and thorn  savannah  turns slowly into a bush savannah towards the north-east of the country, with denser growth. There are significant numbers of  baobab  trees in this area, near the northern end of  Kruger National Park . [ 31 ]   The  Fynbos   Biome , which makes up the majority of the area and plant life in the  Cape floristic region , one of the six  floral kingdoms , is located in a small region of the  Western Cape  and contains more than 9,000 of those species, making it among the richest regions on earth in terms of floral biodiversity. The majority of the plants are  evergreen  hard-leaf plants with fine, needle-like  leaves , such as the  sclerophyllous  plants. Another uniquely South African plant is the  protea  genus of flowering plants. There are around 130 different species of protea in South Africa.   While South Africa has a great wealth of flowering plants, it has few  forests . Only 1% of South Africa is forest, almost exclusively in the  humid   coastal plain  along the  Indian Ocean  in  KwaZulu-Natal  (see  KwaZulu-Cape coastal forest mosaic ). There are even smaller reserves of forests that are out of the reach of  fire , known as montane forests (see  Knysna-Amatole montane forests ).  Plantations  of imported tree species are predominant, particularly the non-native  eucalyptus  and  pine . South Africa has lost a large area of natural habitat in the last four decades, primarily due to  overpopulation , sprawling development patterns and  deforestation  during the nineteenth century. South Africa is one of the worst affected countries in the world when it comes to invasion by alien species with many (e.g.  Black Wattle ,  Port Jackson ,  Hakea ,  Lantana  and  Jacaranda ) posing a significant threat to the native  biodiversity  and the already scarce water resources. The original  temperate forest  that met the first European settlers to South Africa was exploited ruthlessly until only small patches remained. Currently, South African  hardwood  trees like  Real Yellowwood   (Podocarpus latifolius) ,  stinkwood   (Ocotea bullata) , and South African  Black Ironwood   (Olea laurifolia)  are under government protection.   Numerous  mammals  are found in the  bushveld  habitats including  lions ,  leopards ,  white rhinos ,  blue wildebeest ,  kudus ,  impalas ,  hyenas ,  hippopotamus  and  giraffes . A significant extent of the bushveld habitat exists in the north-east including  Kruger National Park  and the  Mala Mala  Reserve, as well as in the far north in the  Waterberg Biosphere .   Climate change is expected to bring considerable warming and drying to much of this already semi-arid region, with greater frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, flooding and drought. According to computer generated climate modelling produced by the South African National Biodiversity Institute [ 32 ]  parts of southern Africa will see an increase in temperature by about one degree Celsius along the coast to more than four degrees Celsius in the already hot hinterland such as the  Northern Cape  in late spring and summertime by 2050.   The Cape Floral Kingdom has been identified as one of the global  biodiversity hotspots  since it will be hit very hard by  climate change  and has such a great diversity of life. Drought, increased intensity and frequency of fire and climbing temperatures are expected to push many of these  rare species  towards  extinction .   South Africa houses many endemic species, among them the  critically endangered   Riverine Rabbit  ( Bunolagus monticullaris ) in the  Karoo .     Economy   Main article:  Economy of South Africa          The  Victoria & Alfred Waterfront  in  Cape Town  with  Table Mountain  in the background. Cape Town has become an important  retail  and  tourism  centre for the country, and attracts the largest number of foreign visitors in South Africa       By  UN  classification South Africa is a middle-income country with an abundant supply of resources, well-developed financial, legal, communications, energy, and transport sectors, a  stock exchange  (the  JSE Limited ), that ranks among the top twenty in the world, and a modern infrastructure supporting an efficient distribution of goods to major urban centres throughout the entire region. South Africa is ranked 25th in the world in terms of  GDP  (PPP) as of 2007.   Advanced development is significantly localised around four areas: Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Durban, and Pretoria/Johannesburg. Beyond these four economic centres, development is marginal and poverty is still prevalent despite government efforts. Consequently the vast majority of South Africans are poor. However, key marginal areas have experienced rapid growth recently. Such areas include Mossel Bay to Plettenberg Bay; Rustenburg area; Nelspruit area; Bloemfontein; Cape West Coast; and the KwaZulu-Natal North Coast.   Even though South Africa has the seventh highest per capita income in Africa, only behind  Libya ,  Mauritius  it suffers from large income gaps and a  dual economy  marking it as a  developing country . South Africa has one of the highest rates of  income inequality  in the world. A decade of continual economic growth has helped to lower unemployment, but daunting economic and social problems remain. The average South African household income decreased considerably between 1995 and 2000. As for racial inequality,  Statistics South Africa  reported that in 1995 the average white household earned four times as much as the average black household. In 2000 the average white household was earning six times more than the average black household. [ 33 ]  The  affirmative action  policies have seen a rise in black economic wealth and an emerging black middle class. [ 34 ]  Other problems are crime, corruption, and  HIV / AIDS .   At the start of 2000, then President Thabo Mbeki vowed to promote economic growth and foreign investment by relaxing restrictive labour laws, stepping up the pace of  privatisation , and cutting unneeded governmental spending. His policies face strong opposition from organised  labour . South Africa is also the largest energy producer and consumer on the continent. South Africa is a popular tourist destination, and a substantial amount of revenue comes from tourism. [ 35 ]  Among the main attractions are the diverse and picturesque culture, the game reserves and the highly regarded local wines.   The South African  rand  (ZAR), is the most actively traded emerging  market currency  in the world. It has joined an elite club of fifteen currencies, the  Continuous linked settlement  (CLS), where forex transactions are settled immediately, lowering the risks of transacting across  time zones . The rand was the best-performing currency against the  United States dollar  (USD) between 2002 and 2005, according to the  Bloomberg  Currency Scorecard.   The volatility of the  rand  has affected economic activity, falling sharply during 2001 and hitting a historic low of 13.85  ZAR  to the  USD , raising fears of inflation, and causing the Reserve Bank to increase  interest rates . The rand has since recovered, trading at 7.13 ZAR to the dollar as of January 2008. However, as exporters are put under considerable pressure from a stronger domestic currency, many call for government intervention to help soften the rand.   Refugees from poorer neighbouring countries include many immigrants from the DRC, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Malawi and others, representing a large portion of the informal sector. With high unemployment levels amongst poorer South Africans,  xenophobia  is prevalent and many people born in South Africa feel resentful of immigrants who are seen to be depriving the native population of jobs, a feeling which has been given credibility by the fact that many South African employers have employed migrants from other countries for lower pay than South African citizens, especially in the  construction ,  tourism ,  agriculture  and  domestic service  industries. Illegal immigrants are also heavily involved in informal trading. [ 36 ]  However, many immigrants to South Africa continue to live in poor conditions, and the South African immigration policy has become increasingly restrictive since 1994. [ 37 ]   Principal international trading partners of South Africa  besides other African countries  include  Germany , the  United States ,  China ,  Japan , the  United Kingdom  and  Spain .  [ 38 ]  Chief exports include  corn ,  diamonds ,  fruits ,  gold ,  metals  and  minerals ,  sugar , and  wool .  Machinery  and transportation equipment make up more than one-third of the value of the countrys imports. Other imports include  chemicals , manufactured goods, and  petroleum .     Electricity crisis   After unsuccessful attempts by the government to encourage private construction of electricity generation capacity, in 2007 the state-owned electricity supplier ( Eskom ) started experiencing a lack of capacity in the electrical generating and reticulation infrastructure. This led to an inability to meet the routine demands of industry and consumers, resulting in countrywide  rolling blackouts . Initially the lack of capacity was triggered by a failure at  Koeberg nuclear power station , but since then a general lack of capacity became evident. The supplier has been widely criticised for failing to adequately plan for and construct sufficient electrical generating capacity, [ 39 ]  although ultimately the government has admitted that it is at fault for refusing to approve funding for investment in infrastructure. [ 40 ]     Agriculture          Workers planting on a farm in the central area of  Mpumalanga .               Farm  workers.       South Africa has a large agricultural sector and is a net exporter of  farming  products. There are almost a thousand  agricultural cooperatives  and  agribusinesses  throughout the country, and agricultural exports have constituted 8% of South African total exports for the past five years. The agricultural industry contributes around 10% of formal employment, relatively low compared to other parts of Africa, as well as providing work for casual labourers and contributing around 2.6% of  GDP  for the nation. [ 41 ]  However, due to the  aridity  of the land, only 13.5% can be used for crop production, and only 3% is considered high potential land. [ 42 ]   Although the commercial farming sector is relatively well developed, people in some rural areas still survive on  subsistence agriculture . It is the eighth largest wine producer in the world, and the eleventh largest producer of sunflower seed. South Africa is a net exporter of agricultural products and foodstuffs, the largest number of exported items being  sugar ,  grapes ,  citrus ,  nectarines ,  wine  and  deciduous  fruit. The largest locally produced crop is  maize  (corn), and it has been estimated that 9 million tons are produced every year, with 7.4 million tons being consumed.  Livestock  are also popular on South African farms, with the country producing 85% of all meat consumed. The dairy industry consists of around 4,300 milk producers providing employment for 60,000 farm workers and contributing to the livelihoods of around 40,000 others. [ 43 ]   In recent years, the agricultural sector has introduced several reforms, some of which are controversial, such as  land reform  and the deregulation of the market for agricultural products. Land reform has been criticised both by farmers' groups and by landless workers, the latter alleging that the pace of change has not been fast enough, and the former alleging racist treatment and expressing concerns that a similar situation to  Zimbabwe's land reform policy  may develop, [ 44 ]  a fear exacerbated by comments made by  deputy president , the deputy president of South Africa. [ 45 ] [ 46 ]  The sector continues to face problems, with increased foreign competition and crime being two of the major challenges for the industry. The government has been accused of either putting in too much effort [ 47 ] , or not enough effort [ 48 ] , to tackle the problem of  farm attacks  as opposed to other forms of violent crime.   Another issue which affects South African agriculture is environmental damage caused by misuse of the land and global climate change. South Africa is unusually vulnerable to climate change and resultant diminution of surface waters. Some predictions show surface water supply could decrease by 60% by the year 2070 in parts of the Western Cape. [ 49 ]  To reverse the damage caused by land mismanagement, the government has supported a scheme which promotes  sustainable development  and the use of natural resources. [ 50 ]  Maize production, which contributes to a 36% majority of the gross value of South Africas field crops, has also experienced negative effects due to climate change. The estimated value of loss, which takes into consideration scenarios with and without the carbon dioxide fertilisation effect  [2]  ,ranges between 10s to 100s of millions of Rands.

Statistics South Africa  provided five  racial  categories by which people could classify themselves, the last of which, ""unspecified/other"" drew negligible responses, and these results were omitted. [ 52 ]  The 2006 midyear estimated figures for the other categories were  Black African  at 79.5%,  White  at 9.2%,  Coloured  at 8.9%, and  Indian or Asian  at 2.5%. [ 53 ]  Even though the population of South Africa has increased in the past decade [ 52 ] [ 54 ]  (primarily due to immigration), the country had an annual population growth rate of 0.501% in 2008 (CIA est.), including immigration. [ 55 ]  South Africa is home to an estimated 5 million  illegal immigrants , including some 3 million  Zimbabweans . [ 56 ] [ 57 ] [ 58 ]  A series of  anti-immigrant riots  occurred in South Africa beginning on 11 May 2008. [ 59 ] [ 60 ]   By far the major part of the population classified itself as African or black, but it is not culturally or linguistically homogeneous. Major ethnic groups include the  Zulu ,  Xhosa ,  Basotho  (South Sotho),  Bapedi  (North Sotho),  Venda ,  Tswana ,  Tsonga ,  Swazi  and  Ndebele , all of which speak  Bantu languages  (see  Bantu peoples of South Africa ).   Some, such as the Zulu, Xhosa, Bapedi and Venda groups, are unique to South Africa. Other groups are distributed across the borders with neighbours of South Africa: The  Basotho  group is also the major ethnic group in  Lesotho . The  Tswana  ethnic group constitute the majority of the population of  Botswana . The  Swazi  ethnic group is the major ethnic group in  Swaziland . The  Ndebele  ethnic group is also found in  Matabeleland  in  Zimbabwe , where they are known as the  Matabele . These Ndebele people are the descendants of a Zulu faction under the warrior  Mzilikazi  that escaped persecution from  Shaka  by migrating to their current territory. The  Tsonga  ethnic group is also found in southern  Mozambique , where they are known as the Shangaan.   The white population is not ethnically homogeneous and descend from many ethnic groups:  Dutch ,  Flemish ,  Portuguese , German, French  Huguenot , English, Irish, Italian, Scottish and  Welsh . Culturally and linguistically, they are divided into the  Afrikaners , who speak  Afrikaans , and English-speaking groups, many of whom are descended from British and Irish immigrants (see  Anglo-African ). Many small communities that have immigrated over the last century retain the use of other languages. The  white population  is on the decrease due to a low birth rate and emigration; as a factor in their decision to emigrate, many cite the high  crime  rate and the  affirmative action  policies of the government. Since 1994, approximately 1 000 000 white South Africans have permanently emigrated. [ 61 ] [ 62 ] [ 63 ] [ 64 ]  Despite high emigration levels, a high level of non-South African white immigrants have settled in the country, in particular from countries such as  Britain  and  Zimbabwe . For example, by 2005, an estimated 212 000 British citizens were residing in South Africa. Since 2003, the numbers of British migrants coming to South Africa has risen by 50%. An estimated 20 000 British migrants moved to South Africa in 2007. There have also been a significant number of  white Zimbabwean  arrivals, fleeing their home country in light of the economic and political problems currently facing the country. As well as recent arrivals, a significant number of white Zimbabweans emigrated to South Africa in the wake of independence in Zimbabwe in 1980. Some of the more nostalgic members of the community are known in popular culture as "" Whenwes "", because of their nostalgia for their lives in  Rhodesia  ""when we were in Rhodesia"". [ 65 ]   The term  Coloured  is still largely used for the people of mixed race descended from slaves brought in from East and Central Africa, the indigenous  Khoisan  who lived in the  Cape  at the time, Bantus, Whites (mostly the  Dutch / Afrikaner  and British settlers) as well as an admixture of  Javanese ,  Malay , Indian,  Malagasy  and Asian blood (such as  Burmese ). The majority speak Afrikaans. Khoisan is a term used to describe two separate groups, physically similar: light-skinned and small in stature. The  Khoikhoi , who were called  Hottentots  by the Europeans, were pastoralists and were annihilated; the San, called  Bushmen  by the Europeans, were hunter-gatherers. Within the Coloured community, more recent immigrants will also be found: Coloureds from the former  Rhodesia  (now  Zimbabwe );  Namibia  and immigrants of mixed descent from India and  Burma  ( Anglo-Indians / Anglo-Burmese ) who were welcomed to the Cape when India and Burma received their Independence.   The major part of the South African  Asian  population is Indian in origin (see  Indian South Africans ); many of them descended from indentured workers brought in the nineteenth century to work on the  sugar   plantations  of the eastern coastal area then known as  Natal . There is also a significant group of  Chinese South Africans  (approximately 100,000 individuals) and  Vietnamese  South Africans (approximately 50,000 individuals). In 2008, the Pretoria High Court has ruled that Chinese South Africans who arrived before 1994 are to be reclassified as  Coloureds . As a result of this ruling, about 12,000 - 15,000  [ 66 ] ethnically Chinese citizens who arrived before 1994, numbering 3%-5% of the total Chinese population in the country, will be able to benefit from government  BEE  policies. [ 67 ]   South Africa hosts a sizeable refugee and asylum seeker population. According to the  World Refugee Survey 2008 , published by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, this population numbered approximately 144,700 in 2007. [ 68 ]  Groups of refugees and asylum seekers numbering over 10,000 included people from  Zimbabwe  (48,400), The  Democratic Republic of the Congo  (24,800), and  Somalia  (12,900). [ 68 ]  These populations mainly lived in Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban, Cape Town, and Port Elizabeth. [ 68 ]     Science and technology   Several important scientific and technological developments have originated in South Africa.  The first human to human heart transplant was performed by cardiac surgeon  Christiaan Barnard  at  Groote Schuur Hospital  in December 1967  .  Max Theiler  developed a vaccine against Yellow Fever,  Allan McLeod Cormack  pioneered x-ray  Computed tomography , and  Aaron Klug  developed crystallographic electron microscopy techniques. These advancements were all recognised with  Nobel Prizes .  Sydney Brenner  won most recently, in 2002, for his pioneering work in  molecular biology .   Mark Shuttleworth  founded an early Internet security company  Thawte , that was subsequently bought out by world-leader  VeriSign . Despite government efforts to encourage entrepreneurship in biotechnology, IT and other high technology fields, no other notable groundbreaking companies have been founded in South Africa. However, it is the expressed objective of the government to transition the economy to be more reliant on high technology, based on the realisation that South African cannot compete with Far Eastern economies in manufacturing, nor can the republic rely on its mineral wealth in perpetuity.   South Africa has cultivated a burgeoning astronomy community. It hosts the  Southern African Large Telescope , the largest optical telescope in the southern hemisphere. South Africa is currently building the  Karoo Array Telescope  as a pathfinder for the $20 billion  Square Kilometer Array  project. South Africa is a finalist, with Australia, to be the host of the SKA.     Society and culture   Main article:  Culture of South Africa          Decorated houses,  Drakensberg Mountains              Traditional  South African cuisine .       It may be argued that there is no ""single"" culture in South Africa because of its ethnic diversity. Today, the diversity in foods from many cultures is enjoyed by all and especially marketed to tourists who wish to sample the large variety of South African cuisine. In addition to  food ,  music  and  dance  feature prominently.   South African cuisine  is heavily  meat-based  and has spawned the distinctively South African social gathering known as a  braai , or barbecue. South Africa has also developed into a major  wine  producer, with some of the best  vineyards  lying in valleys around  Stellenbosch ,  Franschoek ,  Paarl  and  Barrydale . [ 69 ]   There is great diversity in music from South Africa. Many black musicians who sang in Afrikaans or English during apartheid have since begun to sing in traditional African languages, and have developed a unique style called  Kwaito . Of note is  Brenda Fassie , who launched to fame with her song ""Weekend Special"", which was sung in English. More famous traditional musicians include  Ladysmith Black Mambazo , while the  Soweto String Quartet  performs classic music with an African flavour. White and Coloured South African singers are historically influenced by European musical styles including such western metal bands such as  Seether  (formerly Saron Gas). South Africa has produced world-famous jazz musicians, notably  Hugh Masekela ,  Jonas Gwangwa ,  Abdullah Ibrahim ,  Miriam Makeba ,  Jonathan Butler ,  Chris McGregor , and  Sathima Bea Benjamin .  Afrikaans  music covers multiple genres, such as the  contemporary   Steve Hofmeyr  and the  punk rock  band  Fokofpolisiekar . Crossover artists such as  Johnny Clegg  and his bands  Juluka  and  Savuka  have enjoyed various success underground, publicly, and abroad.   The South African black majority still has a substantial number of rural inhabitants who lead largely impoverished lives. It is among these people, however, that cultural traditions survive most strongly; as blacks have become increasingly  urbanised  and  westernised , aspects of traditional culture have declined. Urban blacks usually speak English or  Afrikaans  in addition to their native tongue. There are smaller but still significant groups of speakers of  Khoisan languages  who are not included in the eleven official languages, but are one of the eight other officially recognised languages. There are small groups of speakers of  endangered languages , most of which are from the Khoi-San family, that receive no official status; however, some groups within South Africa are attempting to promote their use and revival.   The  middle class  lifestyle, predominantly of the white minority but with growing numbers of Black, Coloured and Indian people, [ 70 ]  is similar in many respects to that of people found in  Western Europe , North America and  Australasia . Members of the middle class often study and work abroad for greater exposure to the markets of the world.   Asians , predominantly of Indian origin, preserve their own cultural heritage, languages and religious beliefs, being either  Christian ,  Hindu  or  Sunni Muslim  and speaking English, with Indian languages like  Hindi ,  Telugu ,  Tamil  or  Gujarati  being spoken less frequently, but the majority of Indians being able to understand their mother tongue. The first Indians arrived on the famous  Truro ship  as  indentured labourers  in Natal to work the Sugar Cane Fields. There is a much smaller  Chinese  community in South Africa, although its numbers have increased due to immigration from  Republic of China  (Taiwan).   South Africa has also had a large influence in the  Scouting  movement, with many Scouting traditions and ceremonies coming from the experiences of  Robert Baden-Powell  (the founder of Scouting) during his time in South Africa as a military officer in the 1890s. The  South African Scout Association  was one of the first youth organisations to open its doors to youth and adults of all races in South Africa. This happened on 2 July 1977 at a conference known as  Quo Vadis . [ 71 ]   The South African music scene consists of  Kwaito , a new music genre that had developed in the mid 80s and has since developed to become the most popular social economical form of representation among the populous. Though some may argue that the political aspects of Kwaito has since diminished after  Apartheid , and the relative interest in politics has become a minor aspect of daily life. Some argue that in a sense,  Kwaito  is in fact a political force that shows activism in its apolitical actions. Today, major corporations like  Sony ,  BMG , and  EMI  have appeared on the South African scene to produce and distribute  Kwaito  music. Due to its overwhelming popularity, as well as the general influence of DJs, who are among the top 5 most influential types of people within the country,  Kwaito  has taken over radio, television, and magazines. [ 72 ]   Kwaito , much like most hip-hop has its own local flavor and originality. However, unlike when hip-hop first burst on the scene as a politically driven and rebellious underground movement, South Africans wanted to create a happier vibe. As the post-apartheid fog cleared, South African youth found their ""own voice in a style of music known as kwaito, spawning a new (and profitable) industry"". [ 73 ]  According to TIMEeurope magazine, ""The kwaito sound now regularly incorporates traditional African music, jazz, gospel, and even rock guitar, most notably on Mandoza's 2000 hit Nkalakatha, one of the few kwaito records to cross over onto traditionally white radio"". [ 74 ]  In the kwaito, the samples from old school  Jamaican dancehall , European house, etc.,  tempos  are changed, beats are added, and urban street slang is also incorporated. This local flavour of music more recently has been attacked for its lack of ingenuity and its betrayal of its roots. The melodies and the incorporation of sex and dance have since become very similar to the American standard. In addition Kwaito has been criticised for its absence of influential lyrical content. As Kwaito is still a developing genre, and since the South African population is only around 48 million, sales of only 25,000 CDs are required for ""gold"" certification in South Africa. [ 73 ]     Religion   Main article:  Religion in South Africa           St. Mark 's Anglican Cathedral.       According to the latest 2001 national census, Christians accounted for 79.7% of the population. This includes  Zion Christian  11.1%,  Pentecostal  ( Charismatic ) 8.2%,  Roman Catholic  7.1%,  Methodist  6.8%,  Dutch Reformed  6.7%,  Anglican  3.8%, and other Christian 36%.  Islam  accounted for 1.5% of the population,  Hinduism  about 1.3%, and  Judaism  0.2%. 15.1% had no religious affiliation, 2.3% were other and 1.4% were unspecified. [ 75 ] [ 76 ]   African Indigenous Churches were the largest of the  Christian  groups. It was believed that many of these persons who claimed no affiliation with any organised religion adhered to  traditional indigenous religions . Many peoples have  syncretic  religious practices combining Christian and indigenous influences. [ 77 ]   Islam in South Africa  itself is not known to pre-date the colonial period, despite the isolated contact neighbouring  Mozambique  had with  Arab  and  East African  traders. [ citation needed ]  There is no evidence that Islam was known to the  Zulu ,  Swazi , or  Xhosa  of the east coast prior to the colonial era. Many South African Muslims are described as  Coloureds , notably in the  Western Cape , especially those whose ancestors came as slaves from the Indonesian archipelago (the  Cape Malays ). Others are described as  Indians , notably in  KwaZulu-Natal , including those whose ancestors came as traders from  South Asia ; they have been joined by others from other parts of Africa as well as white or black South African converts. It is estimated that  Islam  is the fastest growing religion of conversion in the country, [ 78 ]  with the number of black  Muslims  growing sixfold, from 12,000 in 1991 to 74,700 in 2004. [ 79 ]   Hinduism  dates back to British Colonial period primarily but later waves of continuous immigrants from India have contributed to a sizeable Hindu population. Most Hindus are ethnically South Asian but there are many who come from mixed racial stock and many are converts with the efforts of Hindu missionaries such as ISKCON. Other religions in smaller numbers are  Sikhism ,  Jainism  and  Bah' Faith . [ 76 ]     Languages   Main article:  Languages of South Africa          Map showing principal South African languages by municipality. Lighter shades indicate a non-majority  plurality .             Afrikaans          Northern Sotho          Southern Sotho          Swati          Tsonga            Tswana          Venda          Xhosa          Zulu               South Africa has eleven  official languages : [ 80 ]   Sepedi ,  Sesotho ,  Setswana ,  siSwati ,  Tshivenda ,  Xitsonga ,  Afrikaans ,  English ,  isiNdebele ,  isiXhosa  and  isiZulu . In this regard it is  second only to India  in number. While each language is formally equal to every other, some languages are spoken more than others. According to the 2001 National Census, the three most spoken first home languages are Zulu (23.8%), Xhosa (17.6%) and Afrikaans (13.3%). [ 52 ]  Despite the fact that English is recognised as the language of commerce and science, it was spoken by only 8.2% of South Africans at home in 2001, an even lower percentage than in 1996 (8.6%). [ 52 ]   There are  eleven official names  for South Africa, one in each of the official national languages. The country also recognises eight non-official languages:  Fanagalo ,  Khoe ,  Lobedu ,  Nama ,  Northern Ndebele ,  Phuthi ,  San  and  South African Sign Language . [ citation needed ]  These non-official languages may be used in certain official uses in limited areas where it has been determined that these languages are prevalent. Nevertheless, their populations are not such that they require nationwide recognition.   Many of the ""unofficial languages"" of the  San  and  Khoikhoi  people contain regional  dialects  stretching northward into Namibia and Botswana, and elsewhere. These people, who are a physically distinct population from other Africans, have their own cultural identity based on their  hunter-gatherer  societies. They have been marginalised to a great extent, and many of their languages are in danger of becoming  extinct .   Many white South Africans also speak other European languages, such as  Portuguese  (also spoken by Angolan and Mozambican blacks), German, and  Greek , while some  Asians  and  Indians  in South Africa speak  South Asian  languages, such as  Tamil ,  Hindi ,  Gujarati ,  Urdu  and  Telugu .  French  is still widely spoken by French South Africans especially in places like  Franschhoek , where many South Africans are of French origin. South African French is spoken by less than 10,000 individuals. Congolese French is also spoken in South Africa by migrants.

Other sports with significant support are  swimming ,  golf  and  netball .  Basketball ,  surfing  and  skateboarding  are popular among the youth.   Famous boxing personalities include Baby Jake  Jacob Matlala ,  Vuyani Bungu ,  Welcome Ncita ,  Dingaan Thobela ,  Gerrie Coetzee  and  Brian Mitchell . Football players who have excelled in international clubs include  Lucas Radebe  of  Leeds United  and  Quinton Fortune , formerly of  Manchester United ,  Benni McCarthy  and  Aaron Mokoena  of  Blackburn Rovers  and  Steven Pienaar  of  Everton . South Africa produced  Formula 1  motor racing's 1979 world champion  Jody Scheckter .   South Africa hosted and won the  1995 Rugby World Cup  at their first attempt and again won the  2007 Rugby World Cup  in  France . South Africa was only allowed to participate from 1995 since the end of  Apartheid . It followed the 1995 Rugby World Cup by hosting and winning the  1996 African Cup of Nations  football tournament. It also hosted the  2003 Cricket World Cup  and the  2007 World Twenty20 Championship . South Africa will be the host nation for the  2010 FIFA World Cup , which will be the first time the tournament is held on the African continent.   In 2004, the swim team of  Roland Schoeman ,  Lyndon Ferns ,  Darian Townsend  and  Ryk Neethling  won the gold medal at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, simultaneously breaking the world record in the 4x100 freestyle relay.  Penny Heyns  won Olympic Gold in the 1996  Atlanta Olympic Games .   In golf,  Gary Player  is generally regarded as one of the greatest golfers of all time, having won the  Career Grand Slam , one of five golfers to have done so. Other South African golfers to have successfully won a major tournament include  Bobby Locke ,  Ernie Els ,  Retief Goosen  and  Trevor Immelman .     Current issues     HIV/AIDS   Main article:  HIV/AIDS in South Africa   The spread of  AIDS  (acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome) is an alarming problem in South Africa with up to 31% of pregnant women found to be HIV infected in 2005 and the infection rate among adults estimated at 20%. [ 81 ]  The link between HIV, a virus spread primarily by sexual contact, and AIDS was long denied by prior president  Thabo Mbeki  and then health minister  Manto Tshabalala-Msimang , who insisted that the many deaths in the country are due to malnutrition, and hence poverty, and not HIV. [ 82 ]  In 2007, in response to international pressure, the government made efforts to fight AIDS. [ 83 ]  In September 2008 Thabo Mbeki was ousted by the ANC and  Kgalema Motlanthe  was appointed for the interim. One of Mr. Motlanthe's first actions was to replace Mrs. Tshabalala-Msimang with the current minister,  Barbara Hogan .   AIDS affects mainly those who are sexually active and is far more prevalent in the black population. Most deaths are people who are also economically active, resulting in many families losing their primary wage earners. This has resulted in many 'AIDS orphans' who in many cases depend on the state for care and financial support. [ 84 ]  It is estimated that there are 1,200,000 orphans in South Africa. [ 84 ]  Many elderly people also lose the support from lost younger members of their family. Roughly 5 million people are infected with the disease. [ 83 ]     Crime   Main article:  Crime in South Africa           Prison  buildings on  Robben Island       According to a survey for the period 19982000 compiled by the  United Nations , South Africa was ranked second for  murder  and first for  assaults  and  rapes  per capita. [ 85 ]  Total crime per capita is 10th out of the 60 countries in the data set.   Crime  has had a pronounced effect on society: many middle-class South Africans moved into  gated communities , abandoning the central business districts of some cities for the relative security of suburbs. This effect is most pronounced in  Johannesburg , although the trend is noticeable in other cities as well. [ citation needed ]  Many emigrants from South Africa also state that crime was a big motivator for them to leave.  Crime against the farming community  has continued to be a major problem. [ 86 ]     Skills migration   Along with many African nations, South Africa has been experiencing a "" brain drain "" in the past 20 years. This is believed to be potentially damaging for the regional economy, [ 87 ]  and is almost certainly detrimental for the well-being of the majority of people reliant on the healthcare infrastructure, given the HIV/AIDS epidemic. [ 88 ]  The skills drain in South Africa tends to demonstrate racial contours (naturally given the skills distribution legacy of South Africa) and has thus resulted in large white South African communities abroad. [ 89 ]     Xenophobia   Main article:  Xenophobia in South Africa   In May 2008 long standing state hostility to African migrants exploded in a series of pogroms that left up to 100 people dead and 100,000 displaced.

The South African coast stretches 2,798 kilometres (1,739 mi) [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  and borders both the  Atlantic  and  Indian   oceans . [ 7 ]  To the north of South Africa lie  Namibia ,  Botswana  and  Zimbabwe , to the east are  Mozambique  and  Swaziland , while the  Kingdom of Lesotho  is an independent  enclave  surrounded by South African territory. [ 8 ]   Modern human beings have inhabited South Africa for more than 100,000 years. [ 9 ]  A century and a half after the discovery of the  Cape Sea Route , the  Dutch East India Company   founded  a refreshment station at what would become  Cape Town  in 1652. [ 10 ]  Cape Town became a British colony in 1806. European settlement expanded during the 1820s as the  Boers  (original  Dutch ,  Flemish ,  German  and  French  settlers) and the British  1820 Settlers  claimed land in the north and east of the country. Conflicts arose among the Xhosa, Zulu and Afrikaner groups. However, the discovery of diamonds and later gold triggered the conflict known as the  Anglo-Boer War  as the Boers and the British fought for the control of the South African mineral wealth. Although the Boers were defeated, limited independence was given to South Africa in 1910 as a British dominion. Anti-British policies focused on ultimate independence which was achieved in 1961 when South Africa was declared a  republic . The leading  National Party  legislated for a continuation of racial segregation begun under Dutch and British colonial rule, Boer republics, and subsequent South African governments (and which in 1948 became legally institutionalised  segregation  known as  apartheid ), despite opposition both in and outside of the country. In 1990 the then president  F.W. de Klerk  began to dismantle this legislation, and in 1994 the first democratic election was held in South Africa. This election brought  Nelson Mandela  and the current ruling party, the  African National Congress  to power, and the country rejoined the  Commonwealth of Nations .   South Africa is known for its diversity in cultures, languages, and religious beliefs, and eleven official languages are recognised in its  constitution . [ 7 ]  English is the most commonly spoken language in official and commercial public life, however it is only the fifth most spoken home language. [ 7 ]  South Africa is ethnically diverse, with the largest  Caucasian ,  Indian , and  racially mixed  communities in Africa. Although 79.6% of the South African population is  Black , [ 2 ]  this category is neither culturally nor linguistically homogeneous, as people within this classification speak a number of different  Bantu languages , nine of which have official status. [ 7 ]  Midyear 2007, the South African population was estimated at 47.9 million.

(September 2008)       Main article:  History of South Africa   South Africa contains some of the oldest archaeological sites in the world. [ 11 ]   [ 12 ]  Extensive fossil remains at the  Sterkfontein ,  Kromdraai  and Makapansgat caves suggest that various  australopithecines  existed in South Africa from about three million years ago. [ 13 ]  These were succeeded by various species of  Homo , including  Homo habilis ,  Homo erectus  and modern humans,  Homo sapiens . Settlements of  Bantu -speaking peoples, who were  iron -using agriculturists and herdsmen, were already present south of the  Limpopo River  by the fourth or fifth century (see  Bantu expansion ) displacing and absorbing the original  KhoiSan  speakers. They slowly moved south and the earliest ironworks in modern-day  KwaZulu-Natal Province  are believed to date from around 1050. The southernmost group was the  Xhosa  people, whose language incorporates certain linguistic traits from the earlier KhoiSan people, reaching the  Fish River , in today's  Eastern Cape Province . These  Iron Age  populations displaced earlier people, who often had  hunter-gatherer  societies, as they migrated.     European colonisation          Painting of an account of the arrival of  Jan van Riebeeck , the first  European  to settle in South Africa, with  Devil's Peak  in the background       In 1487, the  Portuguese  explorer  Bartolomeu Dias  became the first European to reach the southernmost point of Africa. Initially named The Cape of Storms, The King of Portugal,  John II , renamed it the  Cabo da Boa Esperana  or  Cape of Good Hope  as it led to the riches of India. This great feat of navigation was later immortalised in  Cames ' epic Portuguese poem,  The Lusiads  (1572). In 1652, a refreshment station was established at the  Cape of Good Hope  by  Jan van Riebeeck  on behalf of the  Dutch East India Company .  Slaves  were brought from  Indonesia ,  Madagascar , and India as a labour source for the Dutch immigrants in  Cape Town . As they expanded east, the Dutch settlers eventually met the south-westerly expanding  Xhosa  people in the region of the  Fish River . A series of wars, called the  Cape Frontier Wars , ensued, mainly caused by conflicting land and livestock interests.   Great Britain  took over the  Cape of Good Hope  area in 1795 ostensibly to stop it falling into the hands of the Revolutionary French, but also seeking to use  Cape Town  in particular as a stop on the route to Australia and India. It was later returned to the Dutch in 1803, but soon afterwards the  Dutch East India Company  declared bankruptcy, and the British annexed the Cape Colony in 1806. The British continued the frontier wars against the Xhosa, pushing the eastern frontier eastward through a line of forts established along the Fish River and consolidating it by encouraging  British settlement . Due to pressure of  abolitionist  societies in Britain, the  British parliament  first stopped its global  slave trade  with the passage of the  Slave Trade Act 1807 , then abolished slavery in all its colonies with the  Slavery Abolition Act 1833 . During the 1830s, approximately 12 000  Boers  (later known as  Voortrekkers ), departed from the  Cape Colony , where they were subjected to British control, to the future Natal, Orange Free State and Transvaal regions. The Boers founded the  Boer Republics  - the  South African Republic  (Now  Gauteng ,  Limpopo ,  Mpumalanga  and  North West  provinces) and the  Orange Free State  ( Free State ).   The discovery of  diamonds  in 1867 and  gold  in 1884 in the interior encouraged economic growth and immigration, intensifying the subjugation of the indigenous people. These important economic resources did not only play a role between European and the indigenous population but also between the Boers and the British. [ 14 ]   The  Boer Republics  successfully resisted British encroachments during the  First Boer War  (18801881) using  guerrilla warfare  tactics, much better suited to local conditions. However, the British returned in greater numbers, more experience, and more suitable tactics in the  Second Boer War  (18991902). The Boers' attempt to ally themselves with  German South-West Africa  provided the British with yet another excuse to take control of the Boer Republics. [ citation needed ]           Boers  in combat (1881).         Independence   After four years of negotiating, the  Union of South Africa  was created from the  Cape  and  Natal  colonies, as well as the republics of  Orange Free State  and  Transvaal , on 31 May 1910, exactly eight years after the end of the Second Boer War. The newly created Union of South Africa was a  dominion . The  Natives' Land Act  of 1913 severely restricted the ownership of land by 'blacks', at that stage to a mere 7% of the country, although this amount was eventually increased marginally. [ 15 ]  The union was effectively granted independence from the United Kingdom with the passage of the  Statute of Westminster , which morphed the  British king's  position within South Africa into that of the distinct  King of South Africa . In 1934, the  South African Party  and  National Party  merged to form the  United Party , seeking reconciliation between Afrikaners and English-speaking ""Whites"", but split in 1939 over the entry of the Union into  World War II  as an ally of the United Kingdom, a move which the National Party strongly opposed.   In 1948, the  National Party  was elected to power, and intensified the implementation of racial segregation that had begun under Dutch and British colonial rule, and subsequent South African governments since the Union was formed. The Nationalist Government systematised existing segregationist laws, and the system of segregation became known collectively as  apartheid . Not surprisingly, this segregation also applied to the wealth acquired during rapid industrialisation of the 1950s, '60s, and '70s. While the White minority enjoyed the highest  standard of living  in all of Africa, often comparable to  First World  western nations, the Black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard, including income, education, housing, and life expectancy. On 31 May 1961, following a whites-only  referendum , the country became a  republic  and left the (British)  Commonwealth . The office of  Governor-General  was abolished and replaced with the position of  State President .   Apartheid became increasingly controversial, leading to widespread  sanctions ,  divestment  and growing unrest and oppression within South Africa. (See also the article on the  History of South Africa in the apartheid era .) A long period of harsh suppression by the government, and at times violent resistance,  strikes , marches, protests, and  sabotage  by bombing and other means, by various anti-apartheid movements, most notably the  African National Congress  (ANC), followed. In the late 1970s, South Africa began a programme of  nuclear weapons  development and in the following decade it produced six deliverable nuclear weapons. The rationale for the nuclear arsenal is disputed, but it is believed [ who? ]  that  Vorster  and  P.W. Botha  wanted to be able to catalyse American intervention in the event of a war between South Africa and the  Cuban -supported  MPLA  government of  Angola .     Democracy   In 1990 the  National Party  government took the first step towards negotiating itself out of power when it lifted the ban on the  African National Congress  and other  left-wing  political organisations, and released  Nelson Mandela  from prison after twenty-seven years' incarceration on a  sabotage  sentence. Apartheid legislation was gradually removed from the statute books, and South Africa also destroyed its nuclear arsenal and acceded to the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . The first  multi-racial elections  were held in 1994, which the ANC won by an overwhelming majority. It has been in power ever since.   In  post-apartheid South Africa , millions of South Africans, mostly black, continued to live in  poverty , though poverty among whites, previously rare, has increased greatly. [ 16 ]  While some have partly attributed this to the legacy of the apartheid system, increasingly many attribute it to the failure of the current government to tackle social issues, coupled with the monetary and fiscal discipline of the current government to ensure both redistribution of wealth and economic growth. Since the ANC-led government took power, the  United Nations   Human Development Index  of South Africa has fallen, while it was steadily rising until the mid-1990s. [ 17 ]  Some of this could possibly be attributed to the  AIDS   pandemic  and the failure of the government to take steps to address it, [ 18 ] some of it can also be pinpointed to a government policy of  redistribution of wealth . As a mitigating factor, the social housing policy of the current government has produced an improvement in living conditions.     Politics   Main articles:  Politics of South Africa ,  Government of South Africa , and  Law of South Africa          The  Union Buildings  in  Pretoria  is the home of the South African executive.       South Africa has three capital cities:  Cape Town , the largest of the three, is the  legislative  capital;  Pretoria  is the  administrative  capital; and  Bloemfontein  is the  judicial  capital. South Africa has a  bicameral   parliament : the  National Council of Provinces  (the  upper house ) has 90 members, while the  National Assembly  (the  lower house ) has 400 members. Members of the lower house are elected on a population basis by  proportional representation : half of the members are elected from national lists and the other half are elected from provincial lists. Ten members are elected to represent each province in the National Council of Provinces, regardless of the population of the province. Elections for both chambers are held every five years. The government is formed in the lower house, and the leader of the majority party in the National Assembly is the  President .   The primary sources of South Africa law are Roman-Dutch mercantile law and personal law with English Common law, as imports of Dutch settlements and  British colonialism . [ 19 ]  The first European based law in South Africa was brought by the  Dutch East India Company  and is called  Roman-Dutch law . It was imported before the  codification  of European law into the  Napoleonic Code  and is comparable in many ways to  Scots law . This was followed in the 19th century by  English law , both  common  and  statutory . Starting in 1910 with unification, South Africa had its own  parliament  which passed laws specific for South Africa, building on those previously passed for the individual member colonies.   Current South African politics are dominated by the  African National Congress  (ANC), which received 69.7% of the vote during the last  2004 general election  and 66.3% of the vote in the  2006 municipal election . The current  President of South Africa  is  Kgalema Motlanthe , who replaced  Thabo Mbeki  on 25 September 2008. Mbeki succeeded former President  Nelson Mandela  in 1999, and was re-elected for a second five year term in 2004, but announced his resignation on 20 September 2008.   The main challenger to the rule of the ANC is the  Democratic Alliance  party, which received 12.4% of the vote in the 2004 election and 14.8% in the 2006 election.  Helen Zille , (elected 6 May 2007), is the party leader; the previous leader was  Tony Leon . The formerly dominant  New National Party , which introduced apartheid through its predecessor, the  National Party , chose to merge with the ANC on 9 April 2005. Other major political parties represented in Parliament are the  Inkatha Freedom Party , which mainly represents  Zulu  voters, and the  Independent Democrats , who took 6.97% and 1.7% of the vote respectively, in the 2004 election.   Since 2004, the country has had many thousands of popular protests, some violent, making it, according to one academic, the ""most protest-rich country in the world"". [ 20 ]  Many of these protests have been organised from the growing  shanty towns  that surround South African cities.     Foreign relations and military   Main articles:  South African National Defence Force ,  Foreign relations of South Africa , and  South Africa and weapons of mass destruction   Since the end of apartheid, the South African foreign policy has focused on its African partners particularly in the  Southern African Development Community  (SADC) and the  African Union . South Africa has played a key role as a mediator in African conflicts over the last decade, such as in  Burundi , the  Democratic Republic of Congo , the  Comoros , and  Zimbabwe . After apartheid ended, South Africa was readmitted to the  Commonwealth of Nations . As the  Union of South Africa , South Africa was a founding member of the  United Nations  and the then Prime Minister  Jan Smuts  wrote the preamble to its constitution. South Africa is currently a non-permanent member of the  United Nations Security Council  and has attracted controversy by voting against a resolution criticising the  Burmese  government in 2006 and against the implementation of sanctions against  Zimbabwe  in 2008. South Africa is a member of the  Group of 77  and chaired the organisation in 2006. South Africa is a member of the  South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone ,  Southern African Customs Union ,  World Trade Organization ,  International Monetary Fund ,  G20  and  G8+5 .   The South African  armed forces , known as the  South African National Defence Force  (SANDF), was created in 1994. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  Previously known as the  South African Defence Force  (SADF), the new force is an all volunteer army and consists of the forces of the old SADF, as well as the forces of the African nationalist groups, namely  Umkhonto we Sizwe  (MK),  Azanian People's Liberation Army  (APLA), and the former  Bantustan  defence forces. [ 21 ]  The SANDF is subdivided into four branches, the  South African Army , the  South African Air Force , the  South African Navy , and the  South African Military Health Services . [ 23 ]   In recent years, the SANDF has become a major  peacekeeping  force in Africa, [ 24 ]  and has been involved in operations in  Lesotho , the  Democratic Republic of the Congo , [ 24 ]  and  Burundi , [ 24 ]  amongst others. It has also participated as a part of multi-national  UN  peacekeeping forces.   South Africa undertook a nuclear weapons programme in the 1970s [ 25 ]  and  may have conducted  a nuclear test over the  Atlantic  in 1979. [ 26 ]  It is the only African country to have successfully  developed nuclear weapons . It has become the first country (followed by Ukraine) with nuclear capability to voluntarily renounce and dismantle its programme and in the process signed the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty  in 1991. [ 25 ]     Provinces, districts and municipalities   Main articles:  Provinces of South Africa ,  Districts of South Africa , and  Municipalities of South Africa          Map showing the provinces and districts (numbered) of South Africa.             Northern Cape          North West          Gauteng          Limpopo          Mpumalanga            KwaZulu-Natal          Eastern Cape          Free State          Western Cape               When apartheid ended in 1994, the South African government had to integrate the formerly independent and semi-independent  Bantustans  into the political structure of South Africa. To this end, it abolished the four former provinces of South Africa ( Cape Province ,  Natal ,  Orange Free State , and  Transvaal ) and replaced them with nine fully integrated provinces. The new provinces are usually much smaller than the former provinces, which theoretically gives local governments more resources to distribute over smaller areas.   The nine provinces are further subdivided into  52 districts :  6 metropolitan  and  46 district municipalities . The 46 district municipalities are further subdivided into  231 local municipalities . The district municipalities also contain 20 district management areas (mostly game parks) that are directly governed by the district municipalities. The six metropolitan municipalities perform the functions of both district and local municipalities.

At 470,979  sq mi  (1,219,912 km), [ 27 ]  South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world (after  Mali ). It is comparable in size to  Colombia .  Njesuthi  in the  Drakensberg  at 3,408 m (11,424 ft) is the highest peak in South Africa.          View of the  Drakensberg mountains , the highest mountain range in South Africa.       South Africa has a generally  temperate climate , due in part to it being surrounded by the  Atlantic  and  Indian Oceans  on three sides, by its location in the climatically milder  southern hemisphere  and due to the average elevation rising steadily towards the north (towards the  equator ) and further inland. Due to this varied topography and oceanic influence, a great variety of climatic zones exist.   The climatic zones vary, from the extreme  desert  of the southern  Namib  in the farthest northwest to the lush  subtropical  climate in the east along the  Mozambique  border and the  Indian  ocean. From the east, the land quickly rises over a  mountainous   escarpment  towards the interior  plateau  known as the  Highveld . Even though South Africa is classified as  semi-arid , there is considerable variation in  climate  as well as  topography .   The interior of South Africa is a vast, rather flat, and sparsely populated  scrubland ,  Karoo , which is drier towards the northwest along the Namib desert. In contrast, the eastern coastline is lush and well-watered, which produces a climate similar to the tropics. The extreme southwest has a climate remarkably similar to that of the  Mediterranean  with wet winters and hot, dry summers, hosting the famous  Fynbos   Biome . This area also produces much of the  wine  in South Africa. This region is also particularly known for its wind, which blows intermittently almost all year. The severity of this wind made passing around the  Cape of Good Hope  particularly treacherous for sailors, causing many  shipwrecks . Further east on the south coast, rainfall is distributed more evenly throughout the year, producing a green landscape. This area is popularly known as the  Garden Route .          Satellite picture of South Africa       The  Free State  is particularly flat due to the fact that it lies centrally on the high plateau. North of the  Vaal River , the Highveld becomes better watered and does not experience subtropical extremes of heat.  Johannesburg , in the centre of the Highveld, is at 1,740 metres (5,709 ft) and receives an annual rainfall of 760 millimetres (30  in ). Winters in this region are cold, although  snow  is rare.   To the north of Johannesburg, the altitude drops beyond the escarpment of the Highveld, and turns into the lower lying Bushveld, an area of mixed dry forest and an abundance of wildlife. East of the Highveld, beyond the eastern escarpment, the Lowveld stretches towards the  Indian  ocean. It has particularly high temperatures, and is also the location of extended subtropical agriculture.   The high  Drakensberg mountains , which form the south-eastern escarpment of the Highveld, offer limited  skiing  opportunities in winter. The coldest place in South Africa is  Sutherland  in the western  Roggeveld Mountains , where midwinter temperatures can reach as low as 15 degrees  Celsius  (5  F ). The deep interior has the hottest temperatures: A temperature of 51.7 C (125 F) was recorded in 1948 in the  Northern Cape  Kalahari near  Upington . [ 28 ]   South Africa also has one possession, the small sub-Antarctic archipelago of the  Prince Edward Islands , consisting of  Marion Island  (290 km/112 sq mi) and Prince Edward Island (45 km/17.3 sq mi) (not to be confused with the  Canadian province of the same name ).           Weather averages for Cape Town, South Africa         Month   Jan   Feb   Mar   Apr   May   Jun   Jul   Aug   Sep   Oct   Nov   Dec   Year       Average high C (F)   27  (81)   28  (82)   26  (79)   24  (75)   20  (68)   18  (64)   17  (63)   18  (64)   19  (66)   22  (72)   24  (75)   26  (79)   28  (82)       Average low C (F)   16  (61)   16  (61)   15  (59)   13  (55)   10  (50)   8  (46)   8  (46)   8  (46)   9  (48)   11  (52)   14  (57)   15  (59)   8  (46)       Precipitation  mm (inches)   16.5  (0.65)   13  (0.51)   20  (0.79)   54  (2.13)   92  (3.62)   111  (4.37)   96  (3.78)   87  (3.43)   56  (2.2)   40  (1.57)   24  (0.94)   18  (0.71)   627  (24.69)       Source: EuroWEATHER [ 29 ]  2008-02-22         Flora and fauna   See also:  Wildlife of South Africa   See also:  Protected areas of South Africa           Fynbos , a  floral kingdom  unique to South Africa, is found near  Cape Town               Swartberg  mountains near the town of  Oudtshoorn              A field of flowers in Weskus National Park.       South Africa is one of only 17 countries worldwide considered  megadiverse . It has more than 20,000 different  plants , or about 10% of all the known  species  of plants on  Earth , making it particularly rich in plant biodiversity. South Africa is the 6th most biodiverse country, [ 30 ]  after  Brazil ,  Colombia ,  Indonesia ,  China , and  Mexico . The most prevalent biome in South Africa is the  grassland , particularly on the  Highveld , where the plant cover is dominated by different  grasses , low  shrubs , and  acacia trees , mainly camel-thorn and whitethorn.  Vegetation  becomes even more sparse towards the northwest due to low  rainfall . There are several species of water-storing  succulents  like  aloes  and euphorbias in the very hot and dry  Namaqualand  area. The grass and thorn  savannah  turns slowly into a bush savannah towards the north-east of the country, with denser growth. There are significant numbers of  baobab  trees in this area, near the northern end of  Kruger National Park . [ 31 ]   The  Fynbos   Biome , which makes up the majority of the area and plant life in the  Cape floristic region , one of the six  floral kingdoms , is located in a small region of the  Western Cape  and contains more than 9,000 of those species, making it among the richest regions on earth in terms of floral biodiversity. The majority of the plants are  evergreen  hard-leaf plants with fine, needle-like  leaves , such as the  sclerophyllous  plants. Another uniquely South African plant is the  protea  genus of flowering plants. There are around 130 different species of protea in South Africa.   While South Africa has a great wealth of flowering plants, it has few  forests . Only 1% of South Africa is forest, almost exclusively in the  humid   coastal plain  along the  Indian Ocean  in  KwaZulu-Natal  (see  KwaZulu-Cape coastal forest mosaic ). There are even smaller reserves of forests that are out of the reach of  fire , known as montane forests (see  Knysna-Amatole montane forests ).  Plantations  of imported tree species are predominant, particularly the non-native  eucalyptus  and  pine . South Africa has lost a large area of natural habitat in the last four decades, primarily due to  overpopulation , sprawling development patterns and  deforestation  during the nineteenth century. South Africa is one of the worst affected countries in the world when it comes to invasion by alien species with many (e.g.  Black Wattle ,  Port Jackson ,  Hakea ,  Lantana  and  Jacaranda ) posing a significant threat to the native  biodiversity  and the already scarce water resources. The original  temperate forest  that met the first European settlers to South Africa was exploited ruthlessly until only small patches remained. Currently, South African  hardwood  trees like  Real Yellowwood   (Podocarpus latifolius) ,  stinkwood   (Ocotea bullata) , and South African  Black Ironwood   (Olea laurifolia)  are under government protection.   Numerous  mammals  are found in the  bushveld  habitats including  lions ,  leopards ,  white rhinos ,  blue wildebeest ,  kudus ,  impalas ,  hyenas ,  hippopotamus  and  giraffes . A significant extent of the bushveld habitat exists in the north-east including  Kruger National Park  and the  Mala Mala  Reserve, as well as in the far north in the  Waterberg Biosphere .   Climate change is expected to bring considerable warming and drying to much of this already semi-arid region, with greater frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, flooding and drought. According to computer generated climate modelling produced by the South African National Biodiversity Institute [ 32 ]  parts of southern Africa will see an increase in temperature by about one degree Celsius along the coast to more than four degrees Celsius in the already hot hinterland such as the  Northern Cape  in late spring and summertime by 2050.   The Cape Floral Kingdom has been identified as one of the global  biodiversity hotspots  since it will be hit very hard by  climate change  and has such a great diversity of life. Drought, increased intensity and frequency of fire and climbing temperatures are expected to push many of these  rare species  towards  extinction .   South Africa houses many endemic species, among them the  critically endangered   Riverine Rabbit  ( Bunolagus monticullaris ) in the  Karoo .     Economy   Main article:  Economy of South Africa          The  Victoria & Alfred Waterfront  in  Cape Town  with  Table Mountain  in the background. Cape Town has become an important  retail  and  tourism  centre for the country, and attracts the largest number of foreign visitors in South Africa       By  UN  classification South Africa is a middle-income country with an abundant supply of resources, well-developed financial, legal, communications, energy, and transport sectors, a  stock exchange  (the  JSE Limited ), that ranks among the top twenty in the world, and a modern infrastructure supporting an efficient distribution of goods to major urban centres throughout the entire region. South Africa is ranked 25th in the world in terms of  GDP  (PPP) as of 2007.   Advanced development is significantly localised around four areas: Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Durban, and Pretoria/Johannesburg. Beyond these four economic centres, development is marginal and poverty is still prevalent despite government efforts. Consequently the vast majority of South Africans are poor. However, key marginal areas have experienced rapid growth recently. Such areas include Mossel Bay to Plettenberg Bay; Rustenburg area; Nelspruit area; Bloemfontein; Cape West Coast; and the KwaZulu-Natal North Coast.   Even though South Africa has the seventh highest per capita income in Africa, only behind  Libya ,  Mauritius  it suffers from large income gaps and a  dual economy  marking it as a  developing country . South Africa has one of the highest rates of  income inequality  in the world. A decade of continual economic growth has helped to lower unemployment, but daunting economic and social problems remain. The average South African household income decreased considerably between 1995 and 2000. As for racial inequality,  Statistics South Africa  reported that in 1995 the average white household earned four times as much as the average black household. In 2000 the average white household was earning six times more than the average black household. [ 33 ]  The  affirmative action  policies have seen a rise in black economic wealth and an emerging black middle class. [ 34 ]  Other problems are crime, corruption, and  HIV / AIDS .   At the start of 2000, then President Thabo Mbeki vowed to promote economic growth and foreign investment by relaxing restrictive labour laws, stepping up the pace of  privatisation , and cutting unneeded governmental spending. His policies face strong opposition from organised  labour . South Africa is also the largest energy producer and consumer on the continent. South Africa is a popular tourist destination, and a substantial amount of revenue comes from tourism. [ 35 ]  Among the main attractions are the diverse and picturesque culture, the game reserves and the highly regarded local wines.   The South African  rand  (ZAR), is the most actively traded emerging  market currency  in the world. It has joined an elite club of fifteen currencies, the  Continuous linked settlement  (CLS), where forex transactions are settled immediately, lowering the risks of transacting across  time zones . The rand was the best-performing currency against the  United States dollar  (USD) between 2002 and 2005, according to the  Bloomberg  Currency Scorecard.   The volatility of the  rand  has affected economic activity, falling sharply during 2001 and hitting a historic low of 13.85  ZAR  to the  USD , raising fears of inflation, and causing the Reserve Bank to increase  interest rates . The rand has since recovered, trading at 7.13 ZAR to the dollar as of January 2008. However, as exporters are put under considerable pressure from a stronger domestic currency, many call for government intervention to help soften the rand.   Refugees from poorer neighbouring countries include many immigrants from the DRC, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Malawi and others, representing a large portion of the informal sector. With high unemployment levels amongst poorer South Africans,  xenophobia  is prevalent and many people born in South Africa feel resentful of immigrants who are seen to be depriving the native population of jobs, a feeling which has been given credibility by the fact that many South African employers have employed migrants from other countries for lower pay than South African citizens, especially in the  construction ,  tourism ,  agriculture  and  domestic service  industries. Illegal immigrants are also heavily involved in informal trading. [ 36 ]  However, many immigrants to South Africa continue to live in poor conditions, and the South African immigration policy has become increasingly restrictive since 1994. [ 37 ]   Principal international trading partners of South Africa  besides other African countries  include  Germany , the  United States ,  China ,  Japan , the  United Kingdom  and  Spain .  [ 38 ]  Chief exports include  corn ,  diamonds ,  fruits ,  gold ,  metals  and  minerals ,  sugar , and  wool .  Machinery  and transportation equipment make up more than one-third of the value of the countrys imports. Other imports include  chemicals , manufactured goods, and  petroleum .     Electricity crisis   After unsuccessful attempts by the government to encourage private construction of electricity generation capacity, in 2007 the state-owned electricity supplier ( Eskom ) started experiencing a lack of capacity in the electrical generating and reticulation infrastructure. This led to an inability to meet the routine demands of industry and consumers, resulting in countrywide  rolling blackouts . Initially the lack of capacity was triggered by a failure at  Koeberg nuclear power station , but since then a general lack of capacity became evident. The supplier has been widely criticised for failing to adequately plan for and construct sufficient electrical generating capacity, [ 39 ]  although ultimately the government has admitted that it is at fault for refusing to approve funding for investment in infrastructure. [ 40 ]     Agriculture          Workers planting on a farm in the central area of  Mpumalanga .               Farm  workers.       South Africa has a large agricultural sector and is a net exporter of  farming  products. There are almost a thousand  agricultural cooperatives  and  agribusinesses  throughout the country, and agricultural exports have constituted 8% of South African total exports for the past five years. The agricultural industry contributes around 10% of formal employment, relatively low compared to other parts of Africa, as well as providing work for casual labourers and contributing around 2.6% of  GDP  for the nation. [ 41 ]  However, due to the  aridity  of the land, only 13.5% can be used for crop production, and only 3% is considered high potential land. [ 42 ]   Although the commercial farming sector is relatively well developed, people in some rural areas still survive on  subsistence agriculture . It is the eighth largest wine producer in the world, and the eleventh largest producer of sunflower seed. South Africa is a net exporter of agricultural products and foodstuffs, the largest number of exported items being  sugar ,  grapes ,  citrus ,  nectarines ,  wine  and  deciduous  fruit. The largest locally produced crop is  maize  (corn), and it has been estimated that 9 million tons are produced every year, with 7.4 million tons being consumed.  Livestock  are also popular on South African farms, with the country producing 85% of all meat consumed. The dairy industry consists of around 4,300 milk producers providing employment for 60,000 farm workers and contributing to the livelihoods of around 40,000 others. [ 43 ]   In recent years, the agricultural sector has introduced several reforms, some of which are controversial, such as  land reform  and the deregulation of the market for agricultural products. Land reform has been criticised both by farmers' groups and by landless workers, the latter alleging that the pace of change has not been fast enough, and the former alleging racist treatment and expressing concerns that a similar situation to  Zimbabwe's land reform policy  may develop, [ 44 ]  a fear exacerbated by comments made by  deputy president , the deputy president of South Africa. [ 45 ] [ 46 ]  The sector continues to face problems, with increased foreign competition and crime being two of the major challenges for the industry. The government has been accused of either putting in too much effort [ 47 ] , or not enough effort [ 48 ] , to tackle the problem of  farm attacks  as opposed to other forms of violent crime.   Another issue which affects South African agriculture is environmental damage caused by misuse of the land and global climate change. South Africa is unusually vulnerable to climate change and resultant diminution of surface waters. Some predictions show surface water supply could decrease by 60% by the year 2070 in parts of the Western Cape. [ 49 ]  To reverse the damage caused by land mismanagement, the government has supported a scheme which promotes  sustainable development  and the use of natural resources. [ 50 ]  Maize production, which contributes to a 36% majority of the gross value of South Africas field crops, has also experienced negative effects due to climate change. The estimated value of loss, which takes into consideration scenarios with and without the carbon dioxide fertilisation effect  [2]  ,ranges between 10s to 100s of millions of Rands.

South Africa is a nation of more than 48 million people of diverse origins,  cultures ,  languages , and  religions . The last  census  was held in 2001 and the next will be in 2011.  Statistics South Africa  provided five  racial  categories by which people could classify themselves, the last of which, ""unspecified/other"" drew negligible responses, and these results were omitted. [ 52 ]  The 2006 midyear estimated figures for the other categories were  Black African  at 79.5%,  White  at 9.2%,  Coloured  at 8.9%, and  Indian or Asian  at 2.5%. [ 53 ]  Even though the population of South Africa has increased in the past decade [ 52 ] [ 54 ]  (primarily due to immigration), the country had an annual population growth rate of 0.501% in 2008 (CIA est.), including immigration. [ 55 ]  South Africa is home to an estimated 5 million  illegal immigrants , including some 3 million  Zimbabweans . [ 56 ] [ 57 ] [ 58 ]  A series of  anti-immigrant riots  occurred in South Africa beginning on 11 May 2008. [ 59 ] [ 60 ]   By far the major part of the population classified itself as African or black, but it is not culturally or linguistically homogeneous. Major ethnic groups include the  Zulu ,  Xhosa ,  Basotho  (South Sotho),  Bapedi  (North Sotho),  Venda ,  Tswana ,  Tsonga ,  Swazi  and  Ndebele , all of which speak  Bantu languages  (see  Bantu peoples of South Africa ).   Some, such as the Zulu, Xhosa, Bapedi and Venda groups, are unique to South Africa. Other groups are distributed across the borders with neighbours of South Africa: The  Basotho  group is also the major ethnic group in  Lesotho . The  Tswana  ethnic group constitute the majority of the population of  Botswana . The  Swazi  ethnic group is the major ethnic group in  Swaziland . The  Ndebele  ethnic group is also found in  Matabeleland  in  Zimbabwe , where they are known as the  Matabele . These Ndebele people are the descendants of a Zulu faction under the warrior  Mzilikazi  that escaped persecution from  Shaka  by migrating to their current territory. The  Tsonga  ethnic group is also found in southern  Mozambique , where they are known as the Shangaan.   The white population is not ethnically homogeneous and descend from many ethnic groups:  Dutch ,  Flemish ,  Portuguese , German, French  Huguenot , English, Irish, Italian, Scottish and  Welsh . Culturally and linguistically, they are divided into the  Afrikaners , who speak  Afrikaans , and English-speaking groups, many of whom are descended from British and Irish immigrants (see  Anglo-African ). Many small communities that have immigrated over the last century retain the use of other languages. The  white population  is on the decrease due to a low birth rate and emigration; as a factor in their decision to emigrate, many cite the high  crime  rate and the  affirmative action  policies of the government. Since 1994, approximately 1 000 000 white South Africans have permanently emigrated. [ 61 ] [ 62 ] [ 63 ] [ 64 ]  Despite high emigration levels, a high level of non-South African white immigrants have settled in the country, in particular from countries such as  Britain  and  Zimbabwe . For example, by 2005, an estimated 212 000 British citizens were residing in South Africa. Since 2003, the numbers of British migrants coming to South Africa has risen by 50%. An estimated 20 000 British migrants moved to South Africa in 2007. There have also been a significant number of  white Zimbabwean  arrivals, fleeing their home country in light of the economic and political problems currently facing the country. As well as recent arrivals, a significant number of white Zimbabweans emigrated to South Africa in the wake of independence in Zimbabwe in 1980. Some of the more nostalgic members of the community are known in popular culture as "" Whenwes "", because of their nostalgia for their lives in  Rhodesia  ""when we were in Rhodesia"". [ 65 ]   The term  Coloured  is still largely used for the people of mixed race descended from slaves brought in from East and Central Africa, the indigenous  Khoisan  who lived in the  Cape  at the time, Bantus, Whites (mostly the  Dutch / Afrikaner  and British settlers) as well as an admixture of  Javanese ,  Malay , Indian,  Malagasy  and Asian blood (such as  Burmese ). The majority speak Afrikaans. Khoisan is a term used to describe two separate groups, physically similar: light-skinned and small in stature. The  Khoikhoi , who were called  Hottentots  by the Europeans, were pastoralists and were annihilated; the San, called  Bushmen  by the Europeans, were hunter-gatherers. Within the Coloured community, more recent immigrants will also be found: Coloureds from the former  Rhodesia  (now  Zimbabwe );  Namibia  and immigrants of mixed descent from India and  Burma  ( Anglo-Indians / Anglo-Burmese ) who were welcomed to the Cape when India and Burma received their Independence.   The major part of the South African  Asian  population is Indian in origin (see  Indian South Africans ); many of them descended from indentured workers brought in the nineteenth century to work on the  sugar   plantations  of the eastern coastal area then known as  Natal . There is also a significant group of  Chinese South Africans  (approximately 100,000 individuals) and  Vietnamese  South Africans (approximately 50,000 individuals). In 2008, the Pretoria High Court has ruled that Chinese South Africans who arrived before 1994 are to be reclassified as  Coloureds . As a result of this ruling, about 12,000 - 15,000  [ 66 ] ethnically Chinese citizens who arrived before 1994, numbering 3%-5% of the total Chinese population in the country, will be able to benefit from government  BEE  policies. [ 67 ]   South Africa hosts a sizeable refugee and asylum seeker population. According to the  World Refugee Survey 2008 , published by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, this population numbered approximately 144,700 in 2007. [ 68 ]  Groups of refugees and asylum seekers numbering over 10,000 included people from  Zimbabwe  (48,400), The  Democratic Republic of the Congo  (24,800), and  Somalia  (12,900). [ 68 ]  These populations mainly lived in Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban, Cape Town, and Port Elizabeth. [ 68 ]     Science and technology   Several important scientific and technological developments have originated in South Africa.  The first human to human heart transplant was performed by cardiac surgeon  Christiaan Barnard  at  Groote Schuur Hospital  in December 1967  .  Max Theiler  developed a vaccine against Yellow Fever,  Allan McLeod Cormack  pioneered x-ray  Computed tomography , and  Aaron Klug  developed crystallographic electron microscopy techniques. These advancements were all recognised with  Nobel Prizes .  Sydney Brenner  won most recently, in 2002, for his pioneering work in  molecular biology .   Mark Shuttleworth  founded an early Internet security company  Thawte , that was subsequently bought out by world-leader  VeriSign . Despite government efforts to encourage entrepreneurship in biotechnology, IT and other high technology fields, no other notable groundbreaking companies have been founded in South Africa. However, it is the expressed objective of the government to transition the economy to be more reliant on high technology, based on the realisation that South African cannot compete with Far Eastern economies in manufacturing, nor can the republic rely on its mineral wealth in perpetuity.   South Africa has cultivated a burgeoning astronomy community. It hosts the  Southern African Large Telescope , the largest optical telescope in the southern hemisphere. South Africa is currently building the  Karoo Array Telescope  as a pathfinder for the $20 billion  Square Kilometer Array  project. South Africa is a finalist, with Australia, to be the host of the SKA.     Society and culture   Main article:  Culture of South Africa          Decorated houses,  Drakensberg Mountains              Traditional  South African cuisine .       It may be argued that there is no ""single"" culture in South Africa because of its ethnic diversity. Today, the diversity in foods from many cultures is enjoyed by all and especially marketed to tourists who wish to sample the large variety of South African cuisine. In addition to  food ,  music  and  dance  feature prominently.   South African cuisine  is heavily  meat-based  and has spawned the distinctively South African social gathering known as a  braai , or barbecue. South Africa has also developed into a major  wine  producer, with some of the best  vineyards  lying in valleys around  Stellenbosch ,  Franschoek ,  Paarl  and  Barrydale . [ 69 ]   There is great diversity in music from South Africa. Many black musicians who sang in Afrikaans or English during apartheid have since begun to sing in traditional African languages, and have developed a unique style called  Kwaito . Of note is  Brenda Fassie , who launched to fame with her song ""Weekend Special"", which was sung in English. More famous traditional musicians include  Ladysmith Black Mambazo , while the  Soweto String Quartet  performs classic music with an African flavour. White and Coloured South African singers are historically influenced by European musical styles including such western metal bands such as  Seether  (formerly Saron Gas). South Africa has produced world-famous jazz musicians, notably  Hugh Masekela ,  Jonas Gwangwa ,  Abdullah Ibrahim ,  Miriam Makeba ,  Jonathan Butler ,  Chris McGregor , and  Sathima Bea Benjamin .  Afrikaans  music covers multiple genres, such as the  contemporary   Steve Hofmeyr  and the  punk rock  band  Fokofpolisiekar . Crossover artists such as  Johnny Clegg  and his bands  Juluka  and  Savuka  have enjoyed various success underground, publicly, and abroad.   The South African black majority still has a substantial number of rural inhabitants who lead largely impoverished lives. It is among these people, however, that cultural traditions survive most strongly; as blacks have become increasingly  urbanised  and  westernised , aspects of traditional culture have declined. Urban blacks usually speak English or  Afrikaans  in addition to their native tongue. There are smaller but still significant groups of speakers of  Khoisan languages  who are not included in the eleven official languages, but are one of the eight other officially recognised languages. There are small groups of speakers of  endangered languages , most of which are from the Khoi-San family, that receive no official status; however, some groups within South Africa are attempting to promote their use and revival.   The  middle class  lifestyle, predominantly of the white minority but with growing numbers of Black, Coloured and Indian people, [ 70 ]  is similar in many respects to that of people found in  Western Europe , North America and  Australasia . Members of the middle class often study and work abroad for greater exposure to the markets of the world.   Asians , predominantly of Indian origin, preserve their own cultural heritage, languages and religious beliefs, being either  Christian ,  Hindu  or  Sunni Muslim  and speaking English, with Indian languages like  Hindi ,  Telugu ,  Tamil  or  Gujarati  being spoken less frequently, but the majority of Indians being able to understand their mother tongue. The first Indians arrived on the famous  Truro ship  as  indentured labourers  in Natal to work the Sugar Cane Fields. There is a much smaller  Chinese  community in South Africa, although its numbers have increased due to immigration from  Republic of China  (Taiwan).   South Africa has also had a large influence in the  Scouting  movement, with many Scouting traditions and ceremonies coming from the experiences of  Robert Baden-Powell  (the founder of Scouting) during his time in South Africa as a military officer in the 1890s. The  South African Scout Association  was one of the first youth organisations to open its doors to youth and adults of all races in South Africa. This happened on 2 July 1977 at a conference known as  Quo Vadis . [ 71 ]   The South African music scene consists of  Kwaito , a new music genre that had developed in the mid 80s and has since developed to become the most popular social economical form of representation among the populous. Though some may argue that the political aspects of Kwaito has since diminished after  Apartheid , and the relative interest in politics has become a minor aspect of daily life. Some argue that in a sense,  Kwaito  is in fact a political force that shows activism in its apolitical actions. Today, major corporations like  Sony ,  BMG , and  EMI  have appeared on the South African scene to produce and distribute  Kwaito  music. Due to its overwhelming popularity, as well as the general influence of DJs, who are among the top 5 most influential types of people within the country,  Kwaito  has taken over radio, television, and magazines. [ 72 ]   Kwaito , much like most hip-hop has its own local flavor and originality. However, unlike when hip-hop first burst on the scene as a politically driven and rebellious underground movement, South Africans wanted to create a happier vibe. As the post-apartheid fog cleared, South African youth found their ""own voice in a style of music known as kwaito, spawning a new (and profitable) industry"". [ 73 ]  According to TIMEeurope magazine, ""The kwaito sound now regularly incorporates traditional African music, jazz, gospel, and even rock guitar, most notably on Mandoza's 2000 hit Nkalakatha, one of the few kwaito records to cross over onto traditionally white radio"". [ 74 ]  In the kwaito, the samples from old school  Jamaican dancehall , European house, etc.,  tempos  are changed, beats are added, and urban street slang is also incorporated. This local flavour of music more recently has been attacked for its lack of ingenuity and its betrayal of its roots. The melodies and the incorporation of sex and dance have since become very similar to the American standard. In addition Kwaito has been criticised for its absence of influential lyrical content. As Kwaito is still a developing genre, and since the South African population is only around 48 million, sales of only 25,000 CDs are required for ""gold"" certification in South Africa. [ 73 ]     Religion   Main article:  Religion in South Africa           St. Mark 's Anglican Cathedral.       According to the latest 2001 national census, Christians accounted for 79.7% of the population. This includes  Zion Christian  11.1%,  Pentecostal  ( Charismatic ) 8.2%,  Roman Catholic  7.1%,  Methodist  6.8%,  Dutch Reformed  6.7%,  Anglican  3.8%, and other Christian 36%.  Islam  accounted for 1.5% of the population,  Hinduism  about 1.3%, and  Judaism  0.2%. 15.1% had no religious affiliation, 2.3% were other and 1.4% were unspecified. [ 75 ] [ 76 ]   African Indigenous Churches were the largest of the  Christian  groups. It was believed that many of these persons who claimed no affiliation with any organised religion adhered to  traditional indigenous religions . Many peoples have  syncretic  religious practices combining Christian and indigenous influences. [ 77 ]   Islam in South Africa  itself is not known to pre-date the colonial period, despite the isolated contact neighbouring  Mozambique  had with  Arab  and  East African  traders. [ citation needed ]  There is no evidence that Islam was known to the  Zulu ,  Swazi , or  Xhosa  of the east coast prior to the colonial era. Many South African Muslims are described as  Coloureds , notably in the  Western Cape , especially those whose ancestors came as slaves from the Indonesian archipelago (the  Cape Malays ). Others are described as  Indians , notably in  KwaZulu-Natal , including those whose ancestors came as traders from  South Asia ; they have been joined by others from other parts of Africa as well as white or black South African converts. It is estimated that  Islam  is the fastest growing religion of conversion in the country, [ 78 ]  with the number of black  Muslims  growing sixfold, from 12,000 in 1991 to 74,700 in 2004. [ 79 ]   Hinduism  dates back to British Colonial period primarily but later waves of continuous immigrants from India have contributed to a sizeable Hindu population. Most Hindus are ethnically South Asian but there are many who come from mixed racial stock and many are converts with the efforts of Hindu missionaries such as ISKCON. Other religions in smaller numbers are  Sikhism ,  Jainism  and  Bah' Faith . [ 76 ]     Languages   Main article:  Languages of South Africa          Map showing principal South African languages by municipality. Lighter shades indicate a non-majority  plurality .             Afrikaans          Northern Sotho          Southern Sotho          Swati          Tsonga            Tswana          Venda          Xhosa          Zulu               South Africa has eleven  official languages : [ 80 ]   Sepedi ,  Sesotho ,  Setswana ,  siSwati ,  Tshivenda ,  Xitsonga ,  Afrikaans ,  English ,  isiNdebele ,  isiXhosa  and  isiZulu . In this regard it is  second only to India  in number. While each language is formally equal to every other, some languages are spoken more than others. According to the 2001 National Census, the three most spoken first home languages are Zulu (23.8%), Xhosa (17.6%) and Afrikaans (13.3%). [ 52 ]  Despite the fact that English is recognised as the language of commerce and science, it was spoken by only 8.2% of South Africans at home in 2001, an even lower percentage than in 1996 (8.6%). [ 52 ]   There are  eleven official names  for South Africa, one in each of the official national languages. The country also recognises eight non-official languages:  Fanagalo ,  Khoe ,  Lobedu ,  Nama ,  Northern Ndebele ,  Phuthi ,  San  and  South African Sign Language . [ citation needed ]  These non-official languages may be used in certain official uses in limited areas where it has been determined that these languages are prevalent. Nevertheless, their populations are not such that they require nationwide recognition.   Many of the ""unofficial languages"" of the  San  and  Khoikhoi  people contain regional  dialects  stretching northward into Namibia and Botswana, and elsewhere. These people, who are a physically distinct population from other Africans, have their own cultural identity based on their  hunter-gatherer  societies. They have been marginalised to a great extent, and many of their languages are in danger of becoming  extinct .   Many white South Africans also speak other European languages, such as  Portuguese  (also spoken by Angolan and Mozambican blacks), German, and  Greek , while some  Asians  and  Indians  in South Africa speak  South Asian  languages, such as  Tamil ,  Hindi ,  Gujarati ,  Urdu  and  Telugu .  French  is still widely spoken by French South Africans especially in places like  Franschhoek , where many South Africans are of French origin. South African French is spoken by less than 10,000 individuals. Congolese French is also spoken in South Africa by migrants.

Other sports with significant support are  swimming ,  golf  and  netball .  Basketball ,  surfing  and  skateboarding  are popular among the youth.   Famous boxing personalities include Baby Jake  Jacob Matlala ,  Vuyani Bungu ,  Welcome Ncita ,  Dingaan Thobela ,  Gerrie Coetzee  and  Brian Mitchell . Football players who have excelled in international clubs include  Lucas Radebe  of  Leeds United  and  Quinton Fortune , formerly of  Manchester United ,  Benni McCarthy  and  Aaron Mokoena  of  Blackburn Rovers  and  Steven Pienaar  of  Everton . South Africa produced  Formula 1  motor racing's 1979 world champion  Jody Scheckter .   South Africa hosted and won the  1995 Rugby World Cup  at their first attempt and again won the  2007 Rugby World Cup  in  France . South Africa was only allowed to participate from 1995 since the end of  Apartheid . It followed the 1995 Rugby World Cup by hosting and winning the  1996 African Cup of Nations  football tournament. It also hosted the  2003 Cricket World Cup  and the  2007 World Twenty20 Championship . South Africa will be the host nation for the  2010 FIFA World Cup , which will be the first time the tournament is held on the African continent.   In 2004, the swim team of  Roland Schoeman ,  Lyndon Ferns ,  Darian Townsend  and  Ryk Neethling  won the gold medal at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, simultaneously breaking the world record in the 4x100 freestyle relay.  Penny Heyns  won Olympic Gold in the 1996  Atlanta Olympic Games .   In golf,  Gary Player  is generally regarded as one of the greatest golfers of all time, having won the  Career Grand Slam , one of five golfers to have done so. Other South African golfers to have successfully won a major tournament include  Bobby Locke ,  Ernie Els ,  Retief Goosen  and  Trevor Immelman .     Current issues     HIV/AIDS   Main article:  HIV/AIDS in South Africa   The spread of  AIDS  (acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome) is an alarming problem in South Africa with up to 31% of pregnant women found to be HIV infected in 2005 and the infection rate among adults estimated at 20%. [ 81 ]  The link between HIV, a virus spread primarily by sexual contact, and AIDS was long denied by prior president  Thabo Mbeki  and then health minister  Manto Tshabalala-Msimang , who insisted that the many deaths in the country are due to malnutrition, and hence poverty, and not HIV. [ 82 ]  In 2007, in response to international pressure, the government made efforts to fight AIDS. [ 83 ]  In September 2008 Thabo Mbeki was ousted by the ANC and  Kgalema Motlanthe  was appointed for the interim. One of Mr. Motlanthe's first actions was to replace Mrs. Tshabalala-Msimang with the current minister,  Barbara Hogan .   AIDS affects mainly those who are sexually active and is far more prevalent in the black population. Most deaths are people who are also economically active, resulting in many families losing their primary wage earners. This has resulted in many 'AIDS orphans' who in many cases depend on the state for care and financial support. [ 84 ]  It is estimated that there are 1,200,000 orphans in South Africa. [ 84 ]  Many elderly people also lose the support from lost younger members of their family. Roughly 5 million people are infected with the disease. [ 83 ]     Crime   Main article:  Crime in South Africa           Prison  buildings on  Robben Island       According to a survey for the period 19982000 compiled by the  United Nations , South Africa was ranked second for  murder  and first for  assaults  and  rapes  per capita. [ 85 ]  Total crime per capita is 10th out of the 60 countries in the data set.   Crime  has had a pronounced effect on society: many middle-class South Africans moved into  gated communities , abandoning the central business districts of some cities for the relative security of suburbs. This effect is most pronounced in  Johannesburg , although the trend is noticeable in other cities as well. [ citation needed ]  Many emigrants from South Africa also state that crime was a big motivator for them to leave.  Crime against the farming community  has continued to be a major problem. [ 86 ]     Skills migration   Along with many African nations, South Africa has been experiencing a "" brain drain "" in the past 20 years. This is believed to be potentially damaging for the regional economy, [ 87 ]  and is almost certainly detrimental for the well-being of the majority of people reliant on the healthcare infrastructure, given the HIV/AIDS epidemic. [ 88 ]  The skills drain in South Africa tends to demonstrate racial contours (naturally given the skills distribution legacy of South Africa) and has thus resulted in large white South African communities abroad. [ 89 ]     Xenophobia   Main article:  Xenophobia in South Africa   In May 2008 long standing state hostility to African migrants exploded in a series of pogroms that left up to 100 people dead and 100,000 displaced.

Demographics of  Republic of India        Population of India, 1961-2003       Population:   1,147,995,904 (2008 est)       Growth rate:   1.578% (2008 est)       Birth rate:   22.22 births/1,000 population (2008 est)       Death rate:   6.4 deaths/1,000 population (2008 est)       Life expectancy:   69.25 years (2008 est)       male:   66.87 years (2008 est)       female:   71.9 years (2008 est)       Fertility rate:   2.76 children born/woman (NFHS-3, 2008)       Age structure:       0-14 years:   31.5% (male 189,238,487/female 172,168,306)(2008 est)       15-64 years:   63.3% (male 374,157,581/female 352,868,003) (2008 est)       65-over:   5.2% (male 28,285,796/female 31,277,725) (2008 est)       Sex ratio:       At birth:   1.12 male(s)/female (2008)       Under 15:   1.10 male(s)/female (2008)       15-64 years:   1.06 male(s)/female (2008)       Nationality:       Nationality:   noun : Indian  adjective : Indic       Major ethnic:   See  Ethnic Groups of India       Language:       Official:   See  Official languages of India       Spoken:   See  List of Indian languages by number of native speakers       The demographics of India is remarkably diverse. India's population of approximately 1.15 billion people (estimate for July, 2008) comprises approximately one-sixth of the world's population. India has more than two thousand  ethnic groups , and every major  religion  is represented, as are four major  families  of  languages  ( Indo-European ,  Dravidian ,  Austro-Asiatic  and  Tibeto-Burman languages ) as well as a  language isolate  (the  Nihali language [ 1 ]  spoken in parts of  Maharashtra ).   Further complexity is lent by the great variation that occurs across this population on social parameters such as income and education. Only the continent of  Africa  exceeds the linguistic, genetic and cultural diversity of the nation of India.

India has more  arable land  area than any country except the United States [ 3 ] , and  more water area  than any country except Canada and the United States. Indian life, therefore revolves mostly around agriculture and allied activities in small villages, where the overwhelming majority of Indians live. As per the 2001 census, 72.2% of the population [ 4 ]  lives in about 638,000 villages [ 5 ]  and the remaining 27.8% [ 6 ]  lives in over 5,100 towns and over 380 urban agglomerations. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Census       Main article:  List of states and territories of India by population       The most recent  census  of India was conducted in 2001 with the reference date of March 1 of that year. [ 8 ]  It was the 14th census in an unbroken series, and the 6th after  independence  in 1947 (with the exception that census could not be held for  Assam  in the 1981 and  Jammu & Kashmir  in 1951 and 1991). Eight censuses were performed under the  British Raj , the first one was carried out throughout the 1860s and completed in 1872 (The first non-synchronous census). After this, there has been a census every decade starting in 1881 (First synchronous census).   The total population as on 1 March 2001 was 1,027,015,247, making the 2001 census the first to count more than a billion Indians. [ 9 ]  The population had risen by 21.34% compared to the 1991 total. The proportion of female population had increased by 0.3 percentage points to 48.4% during 1991-2001. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Religious demographics       Main article:  Religion in India       80.5% of the Indians are  Hindus , with 13.4% of the population  Muslim , making India home to the third-largest  Muslim  population in the world after  Indonesia  and  Pakistan . India also contains the majority of the world's  Zoroastrians ,  Sikhs ,  Jains  and  Bah' . Other religious groups include  Christians  (2.3%),  Buddhists  (0.8%), Jains (0.4%), and  Jews .   Religious majorities vary greatly by state.  Jammu and Kashmir  and  Lakshadweep  are Muslim majority states;  Nagaland ,  Mizoram  and  Meghalaya  are Christian majority;  Punjab  is mostly Sikh;  Arunachal Pradesh  and  Sikkim  are mainly  Buddhist .   The table below summarizes the findings of the 2001 census with regards to religion in India:     All figures in %.

For example, an H under Gujarati implies a Hindu, Gujarati-speaking Indian of Indo-Aryan ancestry. However this is not a hard and fast rule. For example, in  South India  many members of the  Muslim  community are of  Arab ,  Iranians  or  Turks  origin, but have  Kannada  as their first language. This list excludes caste groups like the  Dalits  which is a socio-political identity across linguistic, religious and racial lines. Indeed, it should be noted that the terms ' Indo-Aryan ' and ' Dravidian ' refer more to the linguistic difference rather than racial differences.

27 ]  but recognizes many of the tribal groups as  Scheduled Castes and Tribes  (see  list of Scheduled Tribes in India ).   It should be noted that  Indo-Aryan ,  Dravidian ,  Tibeto-Burman  and  Austro-Asiatic  are mainly linguistic terms and denote speakers of these linguistic groups.

India's population of approximately 1.15 billion people (estimate for July, 2008) comprises approximately one-sixth of the world's population. India has more than two thousand  ethnic groups , and every major  religion  is represented, as are four major  families  of  languages  ( Indo-European ,  Dravidian ,  Austro-Asiatic  and  Tibeto-Burman languages ) as well as a  language isolate  (the  Nihali language [ 1 ]  spoken in parts of  Maharashtra ).   Further complexity is lent by the great variation that occurs across this population on social parameters such as income and education. Only the continent of  Africa  exceeds the linguistic, genetic and cultural diversity of the nation of India.

India has more  arable land  area than any country except the United States, [ 3 ]  and  more water area  than any country except Canada and the United States. Indian life, therefore revolves mostly around agriculture and allied activities in small villages, where the overwhelming majority of Indians live. As per the 2001 census, 72.2% of the population [ 4 ]  lives in about 638,000 villages [ 5 ]  and the remaining 27.8% [ 6 ]  lives in more than 5,100 towns and over 380 urban agglomerations. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Census   Main article:  List of states and territories of India by population   The most recent  census  of India was conducted in 2001 with the reference date of March 1 of that year. [ 8 ]  It was the 14th census in an unbroken series, and the 6th after  independence  in 1947 (with the exception that census could not be held for  Assam  in the 1981 and  Jammu & Kashmir  in 1951 and 1991). Eight censuses were performed under the  British Raj , the first one was carried out throughout the 1860s and completed in 1872 (The first non-synchronous census). After this, there has been a census every decade starting in 1881 (First synchronous census).   The total population as on 1 March 2001 was 1,027,015,247, making the 2001 census the first to count more than a billion Indians. [ 9 ]  The population had risen by 21.34% compared to the 1991 total. The proportion of female population had increased by 0.3 percentage points to 48.4% during 1991-2001. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Religious demographics   Main article:  Religion in India   80.5% of the Indians are  Hindus , with 13.4% of the population  Muslim , making India home to the third-largest  Muslim  population in the world after  Indonesia  and  Pakistan . India also contains the majority of the world's  Zoroastrians ,  Sikhs ,  Jains  and  Bah' . Other religious groups include  Christians  (2.3%),  Buddhists  (0.8%), Jains (0.4%), and  Jews .   Religious majorities vary greatly by state.  Jammu and Kashmir  and  Lakshadweep  are Muslim majority states;  Nagaland ,  Mizoram  and  Meghalaya  are Christian majority;  Punjab  is mostly Sikh;  Arunachal Pradesh  and  Sikkim  are mainly  Buddhist .   The table below summarizes the findings of the 2001 census with regards to religion in India:     All figures in %.

For example, an H under Gujarati implies a Hindu, Gujarati-speaking Indian of Indo-Aryan ancestry. However this is not a hard and fast rule. For example, in  South India  many members of the  Muslim  community are of  Arab ,  Iranians  or  Turks  origin, but have  Kannada  as their first language. This list excludes caste groups like the  Dalits  which is a socio-political identity across linguistic, religious and racial lines. Indeed, it should be noted that the terms ' Indo-Aryan ' and ' Dravidian ' refer more to the linguistic difference rather than racial differences.

Located at roughly 13 North of the  equator  and 59 West of the  prime meridian , it is considered a part of the  Lesser Antilles . Its closest island neighbours are  Saint Vincent & the Grenadines  and  Saint Lucia  to the west. To the south lies  Trinidad and Tobago with which Barbados now shares a fixed official maritime boundaryand also the  South American  mainland. Barbados's total land area is about 430 square kilometres (166 square miles), and is primarily low-lying, with some higher in the country's interior. The highest point in Barbados is  Mount Hillaby  in the parish of Saint Andrew. The geological composition of Barbados is of non-volcanic origin and is predominantly composed of  limestone - coral  formed by subduction of the South American plate colliding with the Caribbean plate. The island's climate is  tropical , with constant  trade winds  off the Atlantic Ocean serving to keep temperatures mild. Some less developed areas of the country contain tropical woodland and  mangroves . Other parts of the interior which contribute to the agriculture industry are dotted with large  sugarcane  estates and wide, gently sloping  pastures , with panoramic views down to the coast also.   Barbados's  human development index  ranking is consistently among the top 75 countries in the world. For example, in 2006, it was ranked 31st in the world, and third in the Americas, behind  Canada  and the  United States .

The origin of the name ""Barbados"" is controversial. The  Portuguese , en route to  Brazil  are credited as the first Europeans to discover and name the island. It is a matter of conjecture whether the word ""bearded"" refers to the long, hanging roots of the bearded fig-tree ( Ficus citrifolia ), indigenous to the island, to bearded  Caribs  inhabiting the island, or to the foam spraying over the outlying reefs giving the impression of a beard. In 1519, a map produced by the Genoese mapmaker Vesconte de Maggiola showed and named Barbados in its correct position southeast of the island of  Dominica .   Another name associated with Barbados or her people is ""Bim"" or ""Bimshire"". The origin is uncertain but several theories abound, the  National Cultural Foundation  of Barbados follows the Dr.  Richard Allsopp  theory, which is that ""Bim"" was a word commonly used by slaves and that it derives from the phrase ""bi mu"" [ 3 ]  or either (""bem"", ""Ndi bem"", ""Nwanyi ibem"" or ""Nwoke ibem"") [ 4 ]  from an  Igbo  phrase, meaning ""my people."" In colloquial or literary contexts, ""Bim"" can also take a more deific tone, referring to the ""goddess"" Barbados. [ citation needed ]  The word Bim and Bimshire are recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary and the Chamber's Twentieth Century Dictionaries. Another possible source for ""Bim"" is reported to be in the Agricultural Reporter of 25 April 1868, The Rev. N Greenidge (father of one of the island's most famous scholars, Abel Hendy Jones Greenidge) suggested the listing of Bimshire as a county of England. Expressly named were ""Wiltshire, Hampshire, Berkshire, and Bimshire"". [ 5 ]  Lastly in the Daily Argosy (of Demerara i.e. Guyana) of 1652 it referred to Bim as a possible corruption of the word "" Byam "", who was a Royalist leader against the Parliamentarians. That source suggested the followers of Byam became known as Bims and became a word for all Barbadians. [ 6 ]     [ edit ]   Early history   The first indigenous people are thought to be  Amerindians  who arrived from  Venezuela  around approximately 350-400 B.C. The  Arawak  people were the second wave of migrants, arriving from South America around 800. In the thirteenth century, the Caribs arrived from South America in the third wave, displacing both the Arawak and the Salodoid-Barrancoid culture. For the next few centuries, the Caribs  like the Arawak and the Salodoid-Barrancoid  lived in isolation on the island.   The  Portuguese  then briefly claimed Barbados from the mid-1500s to the 1600s; and may have seized the indigenous  Caribs  on Barbados and used them as  slave labour . Other Caribs are believed to have fled the island to neighbouring islands. Apart from possibly displacing the Caribs, the Portuguese left little impact and by the 1610s, they left for South America, leaving the island uninhabited.     [ edit ]   British colonial rule   British sailors who landed on Barbados in 1625 arrived at the site of present-day  Holetown . From the arrival of the first British settlers in 16271628 until independence in 1966, Barbados was under uninterrupted British control. Nevertheless, Barbados always enjoyed a large measure of local autonomy. Its  House of Assembly  began meeting in 1639. Among the initial important British figures was Sir  William Courten .   With the increased implementation of slave codes, which created differential treatment between Africans and the white workers and planters, the island became increasingly unattractive to  poor whites . Black or slave codes were implemented in 1661, 1676, 1682, and 1688. In response to these codes, several slave rebellions were attempted or planned during this time, but none succeeded. However, an increasingly repressive legal system caused the gap between the treatment of typically white indentured servants and black slaves to widen. Imported slaves became much more attractive for the rich planters who would increasingly dominate the island not only economically but also politically. Some have speculated that, because the Africans could withstand tropical diseases and the climate much better than the white slave population, the white population decreased. This is inconsistent with the fact that many poor whites simply migrated to neighbouring islands and remained in tropical climates. Nevertheless, poor whites who had or acquired the means to emigrate often did so. Planters expanded their importation of African slaves to cultivate sugar cane. The Barbados turned from mainly English and Scots-Irish in the seventeenth century to overwhelmingly black by the end of the 18th century.   Barbados eventually had one of the world's biggest sugar industries after Jews from Brazil introduced the sugarcane to the island in the mid 1600s. This quickly replaced  tobacco  plantations on the islands which were previously the main export. As the  sugar  industry developed into its main commercial enterprise, Barbados was divided into large plantation estates that replaced the smallholdings of the early British settlers. Some of the displaced farmers moved to other British colonies in the Americas, most notably  North  and  South Carolina , and  British Guiana , as well as  Panama . To work the plantations, planters imported enslaved West Africans to Barbados and other Caribbean islands.   The British abolished the  slave trade  in 1807 but not the institution itself. In 1816, slaves arose in the largest major slave rebellion in the island's history. Twenty thousand slaves from over seventy plantations rebelled. They drove whites off the plantations, but widespread killings did not take place. This was later termed Bussa's Rebellion after the slave ranger Bussa, who with his assistants hated slavery, found the treatment of slaves on Barbados to be intolerable, and believed the political climate in the UK made the time ripe to peacefully negotiate with planters for freedom (Davis, p. 211; Northrup, p. 191). Bussa's Rebellion failed. One hundred and twenty slaves died in combat or were immediately executed; another 144 were brought to trial and executed; remaining rebels were shipped off the island (Davis, pp. 212-213).   Slavery was finally abolished in the British Empire eighteen years later in 1834. In Barbados and the rest of the British West Indian colonies, full emancipation from slavery was preceded by an apprenticeship period that lasted four years.          Statue of  Lord Nelson  in  National Heroes Square  which predates the more famous  Nelson's Column  by some 27 years.       In 1884, the Barbados Agricultural Society sent a letter to  Sir Francis Hincks  requesting his private and public views on whether the Dominion of Canada would favourably entertain having the then colony of Barbados admitted as a member of the Canadian Confederation. Asked of  Canada  were the terms of the Canadian side to initiate discussions, and whether or not the island of Barbados could depend on the full influence of Canada in getting the change agreed to by the  United Kingdom . Then in 1952 the  Barbados Advocate  newspaper polled several prominent Barbadian politicians, lawyers, businessmen, the Speaker of the  Barbados House of Assembly  and later as first President of the  Senate , Sir Theodore Branker , Q.C. and found them to be in favour of immediate federation of Barbados along with the rest of the British  Caribbean  with complete Dominion Status within five years from the date of inauguration of the  West Indies Federation  with Canada.   However, plantation owners and merchants of British descent still dominated local politics, owing to the high income qualification required for voting. More than 70% of the population, many of them disenfranchised women, were excluded from the democratic process. It was not until the 1930s that the descendants of emancipated slaves began a movement for political rights. One of the leaders of this movement,  Sir Grantley Adams , founded the  Barbados Labour Party  in 1938, then known as the Barbados Progressive League. While being a staunch supporter of the monarchy, Adams and his party also demanded more rights for the poor and for the people. Progress toward a more democratic government in Barbados was made in 1942, when the exclusive income qualification was lowered and women were given the right to vote. By 1949 governmental control was wrested from the planters and, in 1958, Adams became Premier of Barbados.   From 1958 to 1962, Barbados was one of the ten members of the  West Indies Federation , an organisation doomed by nationalistic attitudes and by the fact that its members, as British colonies, held limited legislative power. Adams served as its first and only ""Premier"", but his leadership failed in attempts to form similar unions, and his continued defence of the monarchy was used by his opponents as evidence that he was no longer in touch with the needs of his country.  Errol Walton Barrow , a fervent reformer, became the new people's advocate. Barrow had left the BLP and formed the  Democratic Labour Party  as a liberal alternative to Adams' conservative government. Barrow instituted many progressive social programmes, such as free education for all Barbadians, and the School Meals system. By 1961, Barrow had replaced Adams as Premier and the DLP controlled the government.   With the Federation dissolved, Barbados had reverted to its former status, that of a  self-governing colony . The island negotiated its own independence at a constitutional conference with the United Kingdom in June 1966. After years of peaceful and democratic progress, Barbados finally became an independent state on 30 November 1966, with Errol Barrow its first Prime Minister. Upon independence Barbados maintained historical linkages with Britain by establishing membership to the  Commonwealth of Nations  grouping, a year later Barbados' International linkages were expanded by obtaining membership to the  United Nations  and the  Organization of American States .     [ edit ]   Government and politics          Parliamentary building.           Main articles:  Politics of Barbados  and  Monarchy of Barbados       Barbados has been an independent country since 30 November 1966. It functions as a  constitutional monarchy  and  parliamentary democracy , modeled on the British  Westminster system , with  Elizabeth II ,  Queen of Barbados , as  head of state  represented locally by the  Governor-General ,  Clifford Husbands  and the  Prime Minister  as the  head of the government . Its  Parliament  comprises thirty seats. It has been proposed that Barbados become a  republic  with a  president  replacing the  Barbadian sovereign ; this issue is still being debated, as the island has been stable and governmentally autonomous for decades.   Barbados is a full and participating member of the  Caribbean Community  (CARICOM), the  Caribbean (CARICOM) Single Market and Economy  (CSME), the  Caribbean Court of Justice  (CCJ), which pertains only to Barbados and  Guyana  but is expected to replace the UK  Privy Council  for the entire English-speaking Caribbean eventually, and the  Association of Caribbean States  (ACS). [ 7 ]   Barbados has a two party system, the two dominant parties being the ruling  Democratic Labour Party  and the  Barbados Labour Party . The Barbados Labour Party (BLP) had been in government for fifteen years, since 1993 until the 2008 general election. Under this administration, the Former Prime Minister, The Right Honourable Owen S. Arthur also acted as the Regional Leader of the CSM (Caribbean Single Market). The Right Honorable David Thompson is the Prime Minister of Barbados. [ 8 ]   On 11 April 2006, the 5-Member  UNCLOS  Annex VII Arbitral Tribunal, presided over by H.E. Judge  Stephen M. Schwebel , rendered after two years of international judicial proceedings, the landmark Barbados/Trinidad and Tobago Award, which resolved the maritime boundary delimitation (in the East, Central and West sectors) to satisfaction of both Parties and committed Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago to resolve their fisheries dispute by means of concluding a new Fisheries Agreement.     [ edit ]   Geography and climate of Barbados       Main article:  Geography and climate of Barbados              Map of Barbados              Beach near  Bridgetown , Barbados.       Barbados is extremely small for a Caribbean island. Relatively flat, it rises gently to the central highland region, the highest point being  Mount Hillaby , in the Scotland District, at 340 meters (1,100 ft) above sea level. The island is located in the Atlantic Ocean, to the east of the other Caribbean islands. The  climate  is tropical, with a rainy season from June to October.   Barbados is often spared the worst effects of the region's tropical storms and  hurricanes  during the rainy season as its far eastern location in the Atlantic Ocean puts it just outside the principal hurricane strike zone, and a hurricane hits about every 26 years. The last significant hit from a hurricane to cause severe damage to Barbados was  Hurricane Janet  in 1955.   In the parish of  Saint Michael  lies Barbados' capital and main city,  Bridgetown . Locally Bridgetown is sometimes referred to as ""The City"", but the most common reference is simply ""Town"". Other towns scattered across the island include  Holetown , in the parish of  Saint James ;  Oistins , in the parish of  Christ Church , and Speightstown, in the parish of  Saint Peter .   It is geologically composed of coral (90 m/300 ft thick). The land falls in a series of ""terraces"" in the west and goes into an incline in the east. Most of Barbados is circled by coral reefs.   The climate is moderate tropical with two seasons: dry and wet. The dry season (DecemberMay) and wet season (JuneNovember) gives an annual rainfall of 40-90 inches (1,0002,300 mm).     [ edit ]   Parishes       Main article:  Parishes of Barbados              Map of the parishes of Barbados       Barbados is  divided  into eleven administrative  parishes :     Christ Church   Saint Andrew   Saint George   Saint James   Saint John   Saint Joseph   Saint Lucy   Saint Michael   Saint Peter   Saint Philip   Saint Thomas       [ edit ]   Economy       Main article:  Economy of Barbados       Historically, the economy of Barbados had been dependent on  sugarcane  cultivation and related activities, but in recent years it has diversified into the  manufacturing  and  tourism  sectors. Offshore finance and information services have become important foreign exchange earners, and there is a healthy light manufacturing sector. In recent years the Government has been seen as business-friendly and economically sound. Since the late 1990s the island has seen a construction boom, with the development and redevelopment of hotels, office complexes, and homes.   The government continues its efforts to reduce  unemployment , encourage direct foreign investment, and privatize remaining state-owned enterprises. Unemployment has been reduced from around 14 percent in the past to under 10 percent.          Circulating  coins  2006       The economy contracted in 2001 and 2002 due to slowdowns in tourism, consumer spending and the impact of the  September 11, 2001 attacks , but rebounded in 2003 and has shown growth since 2004. Traditional trading partners include Canada, the  Caribbean Community  (especially  Trinidad and Tobago ), the United Kingdom and the United States.   Business links and investment flows have become substantial: as of 2003 the island saw from Canada  CA$  25 billion in investment holdings, placing it as one of Canada's top five destinations for Canadian  Foreign Direct Investment  (FDI). Businessman  Eugene Melnyk  of  Toronto , Canada, is said to be Barbados' richest permanent resident.   It was thought by key Barbadian industry sources that the year 2006 would have been one of the busiest years for building construction ever in Barbados, as the building-boom on the island entered the final stages for several multi-million dollar projects. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Transport       Main article:  Transport in Barbados       Transport on the island is good, with 'route taxis', called ""ZR's"" (pronounced "" Zed -Rs"" not ""Zee-Rs""), travelling to most points on the island. These small buses can at times be crowded, as passengers are generally never turned down, regardless of the number. However, they will usually take the more scenic routes to destinations. They generally depart from the capital  Bridgetown  or from  Speightstown  in the northern part of the island.          A  Mini Moke  at  Speightstown  beach       The island of Barbados's lone airport is the  Sir Grantley Adams International Airport (GAIA)  ( IATA  identifier  BGI ). It receives daily flights by several major airlines from points around the globe, as well as several smaller regional commercial airlines and charters. The airport serves as the main air-transportation hub for the Eastern Caribbean. It is undergoing a US$100 million upgrade and expansion.   There are three bus systems running seven days a week (though less frequently on Sundays), and a ride on any of them costs $1.50 BBD. The smaller buses from the two privately-owned systems (""ZRs"" and ""minibuses"") can give change; the larger blue and yellow buses from the government-operated  Barbados Transport Board  system cannot. Most routes require a connection in Bridgetown. Some drivers within the competitive privately owned systems are reluctant to advise persons to use competing services, even if those would be more suitable.   Some hotels also provide visitors with shuttles to points of interest on the island from outside the hotel lobby. There are several locally-owned and -operated vehicle rental agencies in Barbados but there are no multi-national car-rental agencies such as Avis, Europcar or Hertz.   There is also a helicopter shuttle service, which offers air taxi services to a number of sites around the island, mainly on the West Coast tourist belt. Air and water traffic is regulated by the  Barbados Port Authority .     [ edit ]   Tourist information   The island is well developed, and there are internationally known hotels offering world-class accommodation. Time-shares are available, and many of the smaller local hotels and private villas which dot the island have space available if booked in advance. The southern and western coasts of Barbados are popular, with the calm light blue Atlantic Ocean and their fine white and pinkish sandy beaches. Along the island's east coast the Atlantic Ocean side are tumbling waves which are perfect for light  surfing , but a little bit risky due to under-tow currents.   Shopping  districts are popular in Barbados, with ample duty-free shopping. There is also a festive night-life in mainly tourist areas such as the  Saint Lawrence Gap . Other attractions include wildlife reserves, jewelery stores,  scuba diving , helicopter rides,  golf ,  festivals  (the largest being the annual crop over festival July/Aug), sightseeing, cave exploration, exotic  drinks  and fine  clothes   shopping .     [ edit ]   Attractions, landmarks and points of interest   Tourism accounts for almost one half of the economy.

Close to 90% of all Barbadians (also known colloquially as  Bajan ) are of  African  descent (""Afro-Bajans""). A mix of many African ethnicities, notably the  Igbo ,  Akan  and  Yoruba people , they are mostly descendants of the  slave  labourers on the sugar plantations. The remainder of the population includes groups of Europeans (""Anglo-Bajans"" / ""Euro-Bajans"") mainly from the  United Kingdom , the  Republic of Ireland , Chinese locally known as Bajan-Chiney, Bajan Hindus from  India  and Muslims from  Bangladesh  and  Pakistan , and an influential ""Arab-Bajans"" group mainly of Christian  Syrians  and  Lebanese  descent. On the island are many people of  Creole  descent, a mixture of Afro-Caribbean and European descent (Primarily British, Irish and  Portuguese ).   Other groups in Barbados include people from the  United Kingdom ,  United States  and  Canada . Barbadians who return after years of residence in the U.S. are called ""Bajan Yankees""; this term is considered derogatory by some.   The country's official language is English, the local dialect of which is referred to as  Bajan , spoken by most. In religion, most Barbadians are  Christians  (67%), chiefly of the  Anglican Church , but there are Protestant,  Roman Catholic ,  Jehovah's Witness ,  Hindu ,  Muslim  and  Jewish  minorities. Barbados is a chief destination for emigrants from the South American nation of  Guyana . The biggest communities outside the Afro-Caribbean community are:     The  Indo-Guyanese , an important part of the economy due to the increase of immigrants from partner country  Guyana . There are reports of a growing Indo-Bajan diaspora originating from Guyana and  India . They introduced soca-chutney ,  roti  and many Indian dishes to Barbados' culture. Mostly from southern India and Hindu states, these 'Desi' peoples are growing in size but smaller than the equivalent communities in Trinidad & Guyana; Hinduism is one of Barbados' growing religions.   Euro-Bajans (4% of the population) [ 10 ]  have settled in Barbados since the 1500s, originating from  England , Portugal, Ireland and  Scotland . In 1643, there were 37,200 whites in Barbados (86% of the population). [ 11 ]  More commonly they are known as "" White Bajans "", although some carry Afro-Caribbean traces and vice-versa. Euro-Bajans introduced folk music, such as  Irish music  and Highland music, and certain place names, such as ""Scotland"", a mountainous region, and ""Trafalgar Square"" in Bridgetown, now renamed ""Heroes Square"". Among White Barbadians there exists an underclass known as  Redlegs ; the descendants of  indentured servants , and prisoners imported to the island. [ 12 ]   Chinese -Barbadians (or, as they are known on the island, ""Bajan-Chineys"") are a small portion of Barbados' Asian demographics, smaller than the equivalent communities of  Jamaica  and  Trinidad . Most if not all first arrived in the 1940s during the Second World War, originating mainly from the then British territory of  Hong Kong . Many Chinese-Bajans have the surnames Chin, Chynn or Lee, although other surnames prevail in certain areas of the island. Chinese food and culture is becoming part of everyday Bajan culture.   Lebanese and Syrians form the Middle Eastern community on the island and make up 89% of the Muslim population. Middle-Eastern Barbadians are often perceived to be the most successful group in business, along with the Chinese Bajans. During the  Arab Israeli Wars , many Syrians and Lebanese headed for the West Indies to escape conflict and poverty in the  Middle East . [ citation needed ]  Also Jewish people arrived in Barbados around the same time, creating the biggest synagogue in the West Indies.   Latin Americans have been migrating to the island since the 18th century, due to the close proximity of  South America , many  Venezuelans  had migrated to Barbados as labourers via Trinidad.  Brazilian Jews ,  Colombians  and  Panamanians  also live on the island. The Spanish language is now being encouraged to be taught as a second language in Barbadian schools over French.       [ edit ]   Culture          Banks beer at dusk           Main article:  Culture of Barbados     See also:  Music of Barbados     The influence of the English on Barbados is more noticeable than on other islands in the West Indies. A good example of this is the island's national sport:  cricket . Barbados has brought forth several great cricketers, including  Garfield Sobers  and  Frank Worrell .   Citizens are officially called Barbadians; Barbados' residents, however, colloquially refer to themselves or the products of the country as ""Bajan"". The term ""Bajan"" may have come from a localized pronunciation of the word Barbadian which at times can sound more like ""Bar-bajan"".   The largest  carnival -like cultural event which takes place on the island is the  Crop Over  festival. As in many other Caribbean and Latin American countries,  Crop Over  is an important event for many people on the island, as well as the thousands of tourists that flock to the island to participate in the annual events. The festival includes musical competitions and other traditional activities. It gets under way from the beginning of July, and ends with the costumed parade on Kadooment Day, held on the first Monday of August.   Barbados retains a strong British influence and is referred to by its neighbours as ""Little England"".     [ edit ]   Sports in Barbados     See also:  Cricket in the West Indies     As in other Caribbean countries of British descent,  cricket  is a favourite sport. In addition to several warm-up matches and six ""Super Eight"" matches, Barbados hosted the final of the  2007 Cricket World Cup .   In  golf , the  Barbados Open  is an annual stop on the  European Seniors Tour . In December 2006 the  WGC-World Cup  took place at the country's  Sandy Lane  resort on the Country Club course, an eighteen-hole course designed by  Tom Fazio .   Motorsports also play a role, with Rally Barbados occurring each summer and currently being listed on the FIA NACAM calendar.   Basketball  is a popular sport played at school or college and is increasing in popularity as is  volleyball , though volleyball is mainly played inside. At certain beaches such as Brandons beach in St. Michael people do get together to play  beach volleyball .   Other sports played include  hockey ,  table tennis ,  road tennis ,  football ,  rugby ,  polo  and  swimming .   Netball  is also popular with women in Barbados.     [ edit ]   National symbols     [ edit ]   Flower          A yellow and red Pride of Barbados ( Caesalpinia pulcherrima ).       The national flower is the Pride of Barbados or  Caesalpinia pulcherrima  (L.) Sw., which grows across the island.     [ edit ]   Flag   The tridented centered within the flag is a representation of the mythological Neptune, god of the sea. The trident in its original unbroken form was taken from the former colonial seal, which itself was replaced by the current coat of arms. Used within the national flag, the left and right shafts of the trident were then designed as 'broken' representing the nation of Barbados breaking away from its historical and constitutional ties as a former colony.   The three points of the  trident  represent in Barbados the three principles of  democracy  - ""government of, for and by the people."" The broken trident is set in a centered vertical band of gold representing the sands of Barbados' beaches. The gold band itself is surrounded on both sides by vertical bands of ultramarine (blue) representing the sea and sky of Barbados.   The design for the flag was created by Grantley W. Prescod and was chosen from an open competition arranged by the Barbados government. Over a thousand entries were received. [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   Golden Shield   The Golden Shield in the coat of arms carries two "" Pride of Barbados "" flowers and the ""bearded"" fig tree ( Ficus citrifolia  or  Ficus barbata ), which was common on the island at the time of its settlement by the British and may have contributed to Barbados being so named.     [ edit ]   Coat of arms   The  coat of arms  depicts two animals which are supporting the shield. On the left is a "" dolphin fish "", symbolic of the fishing industry and seagoing past of Barbados. On the right is a  pelican , symbolic of a small island named  Pelican Island  that once existed off the coast of Bridgetown. Above the shield is the helmet of Barbados with an extended arm clutching two  sugar-cane  stalks. The ""cross"" formation made by the cane stalks represents the saltire cross upon which  Saint Andrew  was crucified. On the base of the Coat of Arms reads ""Pride and Industry"" in reference to the country's motto.     [ edit ]   National heroes       Main article:  Barbadian national heroes       On April 1998, the Order of National Heroes Act was passed by the  Parliament of Barbados . According to the government, the act established that 28 April (the centenary of the birth of Sir Grantley Adams) would be celebrated as  National Heroes' Day . The act also declared that there are ten national heroes of Barbados. All of which would be elevated to the title of the The Right Excellent. [ 14 ]   The ten official National Heroes of Barbados are:-     Bussa  ( - 1816)   Sarah Ann Gill  (1795 - 1866)   Samuel Jackman Prescod  (1806 - 1871)   Dr. Charles Duncan ONeal  (1879 - 1936)   Clement Osbourne Payne  (1904 - 1941)   Sir Grantley Herbert Adams  (1898 - 1987)   Rt.

About forty-five million people live there.   South Africa is next to  Namibia ,  Botswana ,  Zimbabwe ,  Mozambique , and  Swaziland .   The largest city is  Johannesburg ; the  capitals  are  Cape Town ,  Pretoria , and  Bloemfontein . This is because the government is based in Pretoria, the  parliament  in Cape Town and the Supreme Court in Bloemfontein   There are 11 national  languages  or National Lexicography Units (NLUs):  Afrikaans ,  English , Ndebele, Xhosa, Zulu, Swati, Setswana, Sesotho, Sesotho sa Leboa, Venda and Tsonga. As a result, the country has an official name in each language.   One of South Africa's most notable people is  Nelson Mandela , who was its  President  from  1994  until  1999 .

In 1487,  Bartolomeu Dias  discovered the Cape of Good Hope. Dias wanted to call it ""Cape of Storms"", but the  King  of  Portugal  changed it to ""Cape of Good Hope"". He called it this because it gave them a new chance to find a sea route to  India .  In 1652  Jan van Riebeeck  colonized the Cape by starting a refresh station. He started the camp for the  Dutch East India Company  so that they could give fresh food to ships on their way to the south of  Asia . Since there were very few native people living in the Cape, slaves were brought from  Indonesia ,  Madagascar  and  India  to work at the  Colony . In 1795  Great Britain  took the Cape from the  Dutch East India Company  because it wanted to stop  France  from taking it. It was given back to them in 1803 but was then  annexed  in 1807 when the  Dutch East India Company  went  bankrupt .   Diamonds  were discovered in South Africa in 1867 and  gold  was discovered in 1884. This caused many people to come to South Africa from Europe hoping to make money. Not only was there gold and diamonds to find but people were needed to run shops, build houses and do many other jobs. The  First Boer War  happened in 1800-1881. The war was between the British, who controlled the Cape, and the  Boer Republics . The Boer Republics were established when  Dutch  settlers moved north in the  Great Trek .The British soldiers and their commanders underestimated the Boers and lost the war. They returned 8 years later in 1899 and won the war in 1902. The British brought many more soldiers this time, and the Boers had no chance of winning. At this time, the British made use of  concentration camps  which  demoralized  the Boers and helped the British stop the war from lasting any longer. on May 31, 1910 the Union of South Africa was created from the Cape and  Natal  colonies, as well as the  Orange Free State  and the  Transvaal , the two  Boer Republics .     [ change ]   Economy   South Africa's  economy  is split between  First World  and  Third World  standards. The developed part of the economy is similar to that of most wealthy nations, such as Britain or Australia. The rest of the economy is closer to that of poor nations, such as the  Democratic Republic of the Congo  or rural  India .   The main industries in South Africa are mining (mostly gold and diamonds), car making, and  service industries , such as  insurance .     [ change ]   Military   South Africa's military is the most powerful in southern Africa. South Africa spends more on its military than any of its neighbors, and as a result it has very advanced weapons. South Africa used to have  nuclear weapons , but they were taken apart in 1993.     [ change ]   Sports   In  2010 , South Africa will be the first African nation to host the  FIFA World Cup . It also tried to get the  2004 Olympic Games , but arrived in 3rd place, thus losing to  Athens .

The South African coast stretches 2,798 kilometres (1,739 mi) [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  and borders both the  Atlantic  and  Indian   oceans . [ 7 ]  To the north of South Africa lie  Namibia ,  Botswana  and  Zimbabwe , to the east are  Mozambique  and  Swaziland , while the  Kingdom of Lesotho  is an independent  enclave  surrounded by South African territory. [ 8 ]   Modern human beings have inhabited South Africa for more than 100,000 years. [ 9 ]  A century and a half after the discovery of the  Cape Sea Route , the  Dutch East India Company   founded  a refreshment station at what would become  Cape Town  in 1652. [ 10 ]  Cape Town became a British colony in 1806. European settlement expanded during the 1820s as the  Boers  (original  Dutch ,  Flemish ,  German  and  French  settlers) and the British  1820 Settlers  claimed land in the north and east of the country. Conflicts arose among the Xhosa, Zulu and Afrikaner groups. However, the discovery of diamonds and later gold triggered the conflict known as the  Anglo-Boer War  as the Boers and the British fought for the control of the South African mineral wealth. Although the Boers were defeated, limited independence was given to South Africa in 1910 as a British dominion. Anti-British policies focused on ultimate independence which was achieved in 1961 when South Africa was declared a  republic . The leading  National Party  legislated for a continuation of racial segregation begun under Dutch and British colonial rule, Boer republics, and subsequent South African governments (and which in 1948 became legally institutionalized  segregation  known as  apartheid ), despite opposition both in and outside of the country. In 1990 the then president  F.W. de Klerk  began to dismantle this legislation, and in 1994 the first democratic election was held in South Africa. This election brought  Nelson Mandela  and the current ruling party, the  African National Congress  to power, and the country rejoined the  Commonwealth of Nations .   South Africa is known for its diversity in cultures, languages, and religious beliefs, and eleven official languages are recognised in its  constitution . [ 7 ]  English is the most commonly spoken language in official and commercial public life, however it is only the fifth most spoken home language. [ 7 ]  South Africa is ethnically diverse, with the largest  Caucasian ,  Indian , and  racially mixed  communities in Africa. Although 79.6% of the South African population is  Black , [ 2 ]  this category is neither culturally nor linguistically homogenous, as people within this classification speak a number of different  Bantu languages , nine of which have official status. [ 7 ]  Midyear 2007, the South African population was estimated at 47.9 million.

(September 2008)           Main article:  History of South Africa       South Africa contains some of the oldest archaeological sites in the world. [ 11 ]   [ 12 ]  Extensive fossil remains at the  Sterkfontein ,  Kromdraai  and Makapansgat caves suggest that various  australopithecines  existed in South Africa from about three million years ago. [ 13 ]  These were succeeded by various species of  Homo , including  Homo habilis ,  Homo erectus  and modern humans,  Homo sapiens . Settlements of  Bantu -speaking peoples, who were  iron -using agriculturists and herdsmen, were already present south of the  Limpopo River  by the fourth or fifth century (see  Bantu expansion ) displacing and absorbing the original  KhoiSan  speakers. They slowly moved south and the earliest ironworks in modern-day  KwaZulu-Natal Province  are believed to date from around 1050. The southernmost group was the  Xhosa  people, whose language incorporates certain linguistic traits from the earlier KhoiSan people, reaching the  Fish River , in today's  Eastern Cape Province . These  Iron Age  populations displaced earlier people, who often had  hunter-gatherer  societies, as they migrated.     European colonisation          Painting of an account of the arrival of  Jan van Riebeeck , the first  European  to settle in South Africa, with  Devil's Peak  in the background       In 1487, the  Portuguese  explorer  Bartolomeu Dias  became the first European to reach the southernmost point of Africa. Initially named The Cape of Storms, The King of Portugal,  John II , renamed it the  Cabo da Boa Esperana  or  Cape of Good Hope  as it led to the riches of India. This great feat of navigation was later immortalized in  Cames ' epic Portuguese poem,  The Lusiads  (1572). In 1652, a refreshment station was established at the  Cape of Good Hope  by  Jan van Riebeeck  on behalf of the  Dutch East India Company .  Slaves  were brought from  Indonesia ,  Madagascar , and India as a labour source for the Dutch immigrants in  Cape Town . As they expanded east, the Dutch settlers eventually met the south-westerly expanding  Xhosa  people in the region of the  Fish River . A series of wars, called the  Cape Frontier Wars , ensued, mainly caused by conflicting land and livestock interests.   Great Britain  took over the  Cape of Good Hope  area in 1795 ostensibly to stop it falling into the hands of the Revolutionary French, but also seeking to use  Cape Town  in particular as a stop on the route to Australia and India. It was later returned to the Dutch in 1803, but soon afterwards the  Dutch East India Company  declared bankruptcy, and the British annexed the Cape Colony in 1806. The British continued the frontier wars against the Xhosa, pushing the eastern frontier eastward through a line of forts established along the Fish River and consolidating it by encouraging  British settlement . Due to pressure of  abolitionist  societies in Britain, the  British parliament  first stopped its global  slave trade  with the passage of the  Slave Trade Act 1807 , then abolished slavery in all its colonies with the  Slavery Abolition Act 1833 . During the 1830s, approximately 12 000  Boers  (later known as  Voortrekkers ), departed from the  Cape Colony , where they were subjected to British control, to the future Natal, Orange Free State and Transvaal regions. The Boers founded the  Boer Republics  - the  South African Republic  (Now  Gauteng ,  Limpopo ,  Mpumalanga  and  North West  provinces) and the  Orange Free State  ( Free State ).   The discovery of  diamonds  in 1867 and  gold  in 1884 in the interior encouraged economic growth and immigration, intensifying the subjugation of the indigenous people. These important economic resources did not only play a role between European and the indigenous population but also between the Boers and the British. [ 14 ]   The  Boer Republics  successfully resisted British encroachments during the  First Boer War  (18801881) using  guerrilla warfare  tactics, much better suited to local conditions. However, the British returned in greater numbers, more experience, and more suitable tactics in the  Second Boer War  (18991902). The Boers' attempt to ally themselves with  German South-West Africa  provided the British with yet another excuse to take control of the Boer Republics. [ citation needed ]           Boers  in combat (1881).         Independence   After four years of negotiating, the  Union of South Africa  was created from the  Cape  and  Natal  colonies, as well as the republics of  Orange Free State  and  Transvaal , on 31 May 1910, exactly eight years after the end of the Second Boer War. The newly created Union of South Africa was a  dominion . The  Natives' Land Act  of 1913 severely restricted the ownership of land by 'blacks', at that stage to a mere 7% of the country, although this amount was eventually increased marginally. [ 15 ]  The union was effectively granted independence from the United Kingdom with the passage of the  Statute of Westminster , which morphed the  British king's  position within South Africa into that of the distinct  King of South Africa . In 1934, the  South African Party  and  National Party  merged to form the  United Party , seeking reconciliation between Afrikaners and English-speaking ""Whites"", but split in 1939 over the entry of the Union into  World War II  as an ally of the United Kingdom, a move which the National Party strongly opposed.   In 1948, the  National Party  was elected to power, and intensified the implementation of racial segregation that had begun under Dutch and British colonial rule, and subsequent South African governments since the Union was formed. The Nationalist Government systematised existing segregationist laws, and the system of segregation became known collectively as  apartheid . Not surprisingly, this segregation also applied to the wealth acquired during rapid industrialisation of the 1950s, '60s, and '70s. While the White minority enjoyed the highest  standard of living  in all of Africa, often comparable to  First World  western nations, the Black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard, including income, education, housing, and life expectancy. On 31 May 1961, following a whites-only  referendum , the country became a  republic  and left the (British)  Commonwealth . The office of  Governor-General  was abolished and replaced with the position of  State President .   Apartheid became increasingly controversial, leading to widespread  sanctions ,  divestment  and growing unrest and oppression within South Africa.

A long period of harsh suppression by the government, and at times violent resistance,  strikes , marches, protests, and  sabotage  by bombing and other means, by various anti-apartheid movements, most notably the  African National Congress  (ANC), followed. In the late 1970s, South Africa began a programme of  nuclear weapons  development and in the following decade it produced six deliverable nuclear weapons. The rationale for the nuclear arsenal is disputed, but it is believed [ who? ]  that  Vorster  and  P.W. Botha  wanted to be able to catalyse American intervention in the event of a war between South Africa and the  Cuban -supported  MPLA  government of  Angola .     Democracy   In 1990 the  National Party  government took the first step towards negotiating itself out of power when it lifted the ban on the  African National Congress  and other  left-wing  political organisations, and released  Nelson Mandela  from prison after twenty-seven years' incarceration on a  sabotage  sentence. Apartheid legislation was gradually removed from the statute books, and South Africa also destroyed its nuclear arsenal and acceded to the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . The first  multi-racial elections  were held in 1994, which the ANC won by an overwhelming majority. It has been in power ever since.   In  post-apartheid South Africa , millions of South Africans, mostly black, continued to live in  poverty , though poverty among whites, previously rare, has increased greatly. [ 16 ]  While some have partly attributed this to the legacy of the apartheid system, increasingly many attribute it to the failure of the current government to tackle social issues, coupled with the monetary and fiscal discipline of the current government to ensure both redistribution of wealth and economic growth. Since the ANC-led government took power, the  United Nations   Human Development Index  of South Africa has fallen, while it was steadily rising until the mid-1990s. [ 17 ]  Some of this could possibly be attributed to the  AIDS   pandemic  and the failure of the government to take steps to address it, [ 18 ] some of it can also be pinpointed to a government policy of  redistribution of wealth . As a mitigating factor, the social housing policy of the current government has produced an improvement in living conditions.     Politics       Main articles:  Politics of South Africa ,  Government of South Africa , and  Law of South Africa              The  Union Buildings  in  Pretoria  is the home of the South African executive.       South Africa has three capital cities:  Cape Town , the largest of the three, is the  legislative  capital;  Pretoria  is the  administrative  capital; and  Bloemfontein  is the  judicial  capital. South Africa has a  bicameral   parliament : the  National Council of Provinces  (the  upper house ) has 90 members, while the  National Assembly  (the  lower house ) has 400 members. Members of the lower house are elected on a population basis by  proportional representation : half of the members are elected from national lists and the other half are elected from provincial lists. Ten members are elected to represent each province in the National Council of Provinces, regardless of the population of the province. Elections for both chambers are held every five years. The government is formed in the lower house, and the leader of the majority party in the National Assembly is the  President .   The primary sources of South Africa law are Roman-Dutch mercantile law and personal law with English Common law, as imports of Dutch settlements and  British colonialism . [ 19 ]  The first European based law in South Africa was brought by the  Dutch East India Company  and is called  Roman-Dutch law . It was imported before the  codification  of European law into the  Napoleonic Code  and is comparable in many ways to  Scots law . This was followed in the 19th century by  English law , both  common  and  statutory . Starting in 1910 with unification, South Africa had its own  parliament  which passed laws specific for South Africa, building on those previously passed for the individual member colonies.   Current South African politics are dominated by the  African National Congress  (ANC), which received 69.7% of the vote during the last  2004 general election  and 66.3% of the vote in the  2006 municipal election . The current  President of South Africa  is  Kgalema Motlanthe , who replaced  Thabo Mbeki  on 25 September 2008. Mbeki succeeded former President  Nelson Mandela  in 1999, and was re-elected for a second five year term in 2004, but announced his resignation on 20 September 2008.   The main challenger to the rule of the ANC is the  Democratic Alliance  party, which received 12.4% of the vote in the 2004 election and 14.8% in the 2006 election.  Helen Zille , (elected 6 May 2007), is the party leader; the previous leader was  Tony Leon . The formerly dominant  New National Party , which introduced apartheid through its predecessor, the  National Party , chose to merge with the ANC on 9 April 2005. Other major political parties represented in Parliament are the  Inkatha Freedom Party , which mainly represents  Zulu  voters, and the  Independent Democrats , who took 6.97% and 1.7% of the vote respectively, in the 2004 election.   Since 2004, the country has had many thousands of popular protests, some violent, making it, according to one academic, the ""most protest-rich country in the world"". [ 20 ]  Many of these protests have been organised from the growing  shanty towns  that surround South African cities.     Foreign relations and military       Main articles:  South African National Defence Force ,  Foreign relations of South Africa , and  South Africa and weapons of mass destruction       Since the end of apartheid, the South African foreign policy has focused on its African partners particularly in the  Southern African Development Community  (SADC) and the  African Union . South Africa has played a key role as a mediator in African conflicts over the last decade, such as in  Burundi , the  Democratic Republic of Congo , the  Comoros , and  Zimbabwe . After apartheid ended, South Africa was readmitted to the  Commonwealth of Nations . As the  Union of South Africa , South Africa was a founding member of the  United Nations  and the then Prime Minister  Jan Smuts  wrote the preamble to its constitution. South Africa is currently a non-permanent member of the  United Nations Security Council  and has attracted controversy by voting against a resolution criticising the  Burmese  government in 2006 and against the implementation of sanctions against  Zimbabwe  in 2008. South Africa is a member of the  Group of 77  and chaired the organisation in 2006. South Africa is a member of the  South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone ,  Southern African Customs Union ,  World Trade Organization ,  International Monetary Fund ,  G20  and  G8+5 .   The South African  armed forces , known as the  South African National Defence Force  (SANDF), was created in 1994. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  Previously known as the  South African Defence Force  (SADF), the new force is an all volunteer army and consists of the forces of the old SADF, as well as the forces of the African nationalist groups, namely  Umkhonto we Sizwe  (MK),  Azanian People's Liberation Army  (APLA), and the former  Bantustan  defence forces. [ 21 ]  The SANDF is subdivided into four branches, the  South African Army , the  South African Air Force , the  South African Navy , and the  South African Military Health Services . [ 23 ]   In recent years, the SANDF has become a major  peacekeeping  force in Africa, [ 24 ]  and has been involved in operations in  Lesotho , the  Democratic Republic of the Congo , [ 24 ]  and  Burundi , [ 24 ]  amongst others. It has also participated as a part of multi-national  UN  peacekeeping forces.   South Africa undertook a nuclear weapons programme in the 1970s [ 25 ]  and  may have conducted  a nuclear test over the  Atlantic  in 1979. [ 26 ]  It is the only African country to have successfully  developed nuclear weapons . It has become the first country (followed by Ukraine) with nuclear capability to voluntarily renounce and dismantle its programme and in the process signed the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty  in 1991. [ 25 ]     Provinces, districts and municipalities       Main articles:  Provinces of South Africa ,  Districts of South Africa , and  Municipalities of South Africa              Map showing the provinces and districts (numbered) of South Africa.             Northern Cape          North West          Gauteng          Limpopo          Mpumalanga            KwaZulu-Natal          Eastern Cape          Free State          Western Cape               When apartheid ended in 1994, the South African government had to integrate the formerly independent and semi-independent  Bantustans  into the political structure of South Africa. To this end, it abolished the four former provinces of South Africa ( Cape Province ,  Natal ,  Orange Free State , and  Transvaal ) and replaced them with nine fully integrated provinces. The new provinces are usually much smaller than the former provinces, which theoretically gives local governments more resources to distribute over smaller areas.   The nine provinces are further subdivided into  52 districts :  6 metropolitan  and  46 district municipalities . The 46 district municipalities are further subdivided into  231 local municipalities . The district municipalities also contain 20 district management areas (mostly game parks) that are directly governed by the district municipalities. The six metropolitan municipalities perform the functions of both district and local municipalities. The new provinces are:       Province   Former homelands and provinces   Capital   Area (km)   Area (sq mi)   Population (2001)       Eastern Cape   Cape Province ,  Transkei ,  Ciskei   Bhisho   169,580   65,475   6,436,761       Free State   Orange Free State ,  QwaQwa   Bloemfontein   129,480   49,992   2,706,776       Gauteng   Transvaal   Johannesburg   17,010   6,568   8,837,172       KwaZulu-Natal   Natal ,  KwaZulu   Pietermaritzburg   92,100   35,560   9,426,018       Limpopo   Transvaal ,  Venda ,  Lebowa ,  Gazankulu   Polokwane   123,900   47,838   5,273,637       Mpumalanga   Transvaal ,  KwaNdebele ,  KaNgwane ,  Bophuthatswana ,  Lebowa   Nelspruit   79,490   30,691   3,122,994       Northern Cape   Cape Province   Kimberley   361,830   139,703   822,726       North West   Transvaal ,  Cape Province ,  Bophuthatswana   Mafikeng   116,320   44,911   3,669,349       Western Cape   Cape Province   Cape Town   129,370   49,950   4,524,335       Total   1,219,080   470,688   44,819,768         Geography       Main article:  Geography of South Africa              Map of South Africa       South Africa is located at the southernmost region of Africa, with a long  coastline  that stretches more than 2,500 kilometres (1,550 mi) and across two  oceans  (the South  Atlantic  and the  Indian ). At 470,979  sq mi  (1,219,912 km), [ 27 ]  South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world (after  Mali ). It is comparable in size to  Colombia .  Njesuthi  in the  Drakensberg  at 3,408 m (11,424 ft) is the highest peak in South Africa.          View of the  Drakensberg mountains , the highest mountain range in South Africa.       South Africa has a generally  temperate climate , due in part to it being surrounded by the  Atlantic  and  Indian Oceans  on three sides, by its location in the climatically milder  southern hemisphere  and due to the average elevation rising steadily towards the north (towards the  equator ) and further inland. Due to this varied topography and oceanic influence, a great variety of climatic zones exist.   The climatic zones vary, from the extreme  desert  of the southern  Namib  in the farthest northwest to the lush  subtropical  climate in the east along the  Mozambique  border and the  Indian  ocean. From the east, the land quickly rises over a  mountainous   escarpment  towards the interior  plateau  known as the  Highveld . Even though South Africa is classified as  semi-arid , there is considerable variation in  climate  as well as  topography .   The interior of South Africa is a vast, rather flat, and sparsely populated  scrubland ,  Karoo , which is drier towards the northwest along the Namib desert. In contrast, the eastern coastline is lush and well-watered, which produces a climate similar to the tropics. The extreme southwest has a climate remarkably similar to that of the  Mediterranean  with wet winters and hot, dry summers, hosting the famous  Fynbos   Biome . This area also produces much of the  wine  in South Africa. This region is also particularly known for its wind, which blows intermittently almost all year. The severity of this wind made passing around the  Cape of Good Hope  particularly treacherous for sailors, causing many  shipwrecks . Further east on the south coast, rainfall is distributed more evenly throughout the year, producing a green landscape. This area is popularly known as the  Garden Route .          Satellite picture of South Africa       The  Free State  is particularly flat due to the fact that it lies centrally on the high plateau. North of the  Vaal River , the Highveld becomes better watered and does not experience subtropical extremes of heat.  Johannesburg , in the centre of the Highveld, is at 1,740 metres (5,709 ft) and receives an annual rainfall of 760 millimetres (30  in ). Winters in this region are cold, although  snow  is rare.   To the north of Johannesburg, the altitude drops beyond the escarpment of the Highveld, and turns into the lower lying Bushveld, an area of mixed dry forest and an abundance of wildlife. East of the Highveld, beyond the eastern escarpment, the Lowveld stretches towards the  Indian  ocean. It has particularly high temperatures, and is also the location of extended subtropical agriculture.   The high  Drakensberg mountains , which form the south-eastern escarpment of the Highveld, offer limited  skiing  opportunities in winter. The coldest place in South Africa is  Sutherland  in the western  Roggeveld Mountains , where midwinter temperatures can reach as low as 15 degrees  Celsius  (5  F ). The deep interior has the hottest temperatures: A temperature of 51.7 C (125 F) was recorded in 1948 in the  Northern Cape  Kalahari near  Upington . [ 28 ]   South Africa also has one possession, the small sub-Antarctic archipelago of the  Prince Edward Islands , consisting of  Marion Island  (290 km/112 sq mi) and Prince Edward Island (45 km/17.3 sq mi) (not to be confused with the  Canadian province of the same name ).           Weather averages for Cape Town, South Africa         Month   Jan   Feb   Mar   Apr   May   Jun   Jul   Aug   Sep   Oct   Nov   Dec   Year       Average high C (F)   27  (81)   28  (82)   26  (79)   24  (75)   20  (68)   18  (64)   17  (63)   18  (64)   19  (66)   22  (72)   24  (75)   26  (79)   28  (82)       Average low C (F)   16  (61)   16  (61)   15  (59)   13  (55)   10  (50)   8  (46)   8  (46)   8  (46)   9  (48)   11  (52)   14  (57)   15  (59)   8  (46)       Precipitation  mm (inches)   16.5  (0.65)   13  (0.51)   20  (0.79)   54  (2.13)   92  (3.62)   111  (4.37)   96  (3.78)   87  (3.43)   56  (2.2)   40  (1.57)   24  (0.94)   18  (0.71)   627  (24.69)       Source: EuroWEATHER [ 29 ]  2008-02-22         Flora and fauna     See also:  Wildlife of South Africa   See also:  Protected areas of South Africa             Fynbos , a  floral kingdom  unique to South Africa, is found near  Cape Town               Swartberg  mountains near the town of  Oudtshoorn              A field of flowers in Weskus National Park.       South Africa is one of only 17 countries worldwide considered  megadiverse . It has more than 20,000 different  plants , or about 10% of all the known  species  of plants on  Earth , making it particularly rich in plant biodiversity. South Africa is the 6th most biodiverse country, [ 30 ]  after  Brazil ,  Colombia ,  Indonesia ,  China , and  Mexico . The most prevalent biome in South Africa is the  grassland , particularly on the  Highveld , where the plant cover is dominated by different  grasses , low  shrubs , and  acacia trees , mainly camel-thorn and whitethorn.  Vegetation  becomes even more sparse towards the northwest due to low  rainfall . There are several species of water-storing  succulents  like  aloes  and euphorbias in the very hot and dry  Namaqualand  area. The grass and thorn  savannah  turns slowly into a bush savannah towards the north-east of the country, with denser growth. There are significant numbers of  baobab  trees in this area, near the northern end of  Kruger National Park . [ 31 ]   The  Fynbos   Biome , which makes up the majority of the area and plant life in the  Cape floristic region , one of the six  floral kingdoms , is located in a small region of the  Western Cape  and contains more than 9,000 of those species, making it among the richest regions on earth in terms of floral biodiversity. The majority of the plants are  evergreen  hard-leaf plants with fine, needle-like  leaves , such as the  sclerophyllous  plants. Another uniquely South African plant is the  protea  genus of flowering plants. There are around 130 different species of protea in South Africa.   While South Africa has a great wealth of flowering plants, it has few  forests . Only 1% of South Africa is forest, almost exclusively in the  humid   coastal plain  along the  Indian Ocean  in  KwaZulu-Natal  (see  KwaZulu-Cape coastal forest mosaic ). There are even smaller reserves of forests that are out of the reach of  fire , known as montane forests (see  Knysna-Amatole montane forests ).  Plantations  of imported tree species are predominant, particularly the non-native  eucalyptus  and  pine . South Africa has lost a large area of natural habitat in the last four decades, primarily due to  overpopulation , sprawling development patterns and  deforestation  during the nineteenth century. South Africa is one of the worst affected countries in the world when it comes to invasion by alien species with many (e.g.  Black Wattle ,  Port Jackson ,  Hakea ,  Lantana  and  Jacaranda ) posing a significant threat to the native  biodiversity  and the already scarce water resources. The original  temperate forest  that met the first European settlers to South Africa was exploited ruthlessly until only small patches remained. Currently, South African  hardwood  trees like  Real Yellowwood   (Podocarpus latifolius) ,  stinkwood   (Ocotea bullata) , and South African  Black Ironwood   (Olea laurifolia)  are under government protection.   Numerous  mammals  are found in the  bushveld  habitats including  lions ,  leopards ,  white rhinos ,  blue wildebeest ,  kudus ,  impalas ,  hyenas ,  hippopotamus  and  giraffes . A significant extent of the bushveld habitat exists in the north-east including  Kruger National Park  and the  Mala Mala  Reserve, as well as in the far north in the  Waterberg Biosphere .   Climate change is expected to bring considerable warming and drying to much of this already semi-arid region, with greater frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, flooding and drought. According to computer generated climate modelling produced by the South African National Biodiversity Institute [ 32 ]  parts of southern Africa will see an increase in temperature by about one degree Celsius along the coast to more than four degrees Celsius in the already hot hinterland such as the  Northern Cape  in late spring and summertime by 2050.   The Cape Floral Kingdom has been identified as one of the global  biodiversity hotspots  since it will be hit very hard by  climate change  and has such a great diversity of life. Drought, increased intensity and frequency of fire and climbing temperatures are expected to push many of these  rare species  towards  extinction .   South Africa houses many endemic species, among them the  critically endangered   Riverine Rabbit  ( Bunolagus monticullaris ) in the  Karoo .     Economy       Main article:  Economy of South Africa              The  Victoria & Alfred Waterfront  in  Cape Town  with  Table Mountain  in the background. Cape Town has become an important  retail  and  tourism  centre for the country, and attracts the largest number of foreign visitors in South Africa       By  UN  classification South Africa is a middle-income country with an abundant supply of resources, well-developed financial, legal, communications, energy, and transport sectors, a  stock exchange  (the  JSE Limited ), that ranks among the top twenty in the world, and a modern infrastructure supporting an efficient distribution of goods to major urban centres throughout the entire region. South Africa is ranked 25th in the world in terms of  GDP  (PPP) as of 2007.   Advanced development is significantly localised around four areas: Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Durban, and Pretoria/Johannesburg. Beyond these four economic centres, development is marginal and poverty is still prevalent despite government efforts. Consequently the vast majority of South Africans are poor. However, key marginal areas have experienced rapid growth recently. Such areas include Mossel Bay to Plettenberg Bay; Rustenburg area; Nelspruit area; Bloemfontein; Cape West Coast; and the KwaZulu-Natal North Coast.   Even though South Africa has the seventh highest per capita income in Africa, only behind  Libya ,  Mauritius  it suffers from large income gaps and a  dual economy  marking it as a  developing country . South Africa has one of the highest rates of  income inequality  in the world. A decade of continual economic growth has helped to lower unemployment, but daunting economic and social problems remain. The average South African household income decreased considerably between 1995 and 2000. As for racial inequality,  Statistics South Africa  reported that in 1995 the average white household earned four times as much as the average black household. In 2000 the average white household was earning six times more than the average black household. [ 33 ]  The  affirmative action  policies have seen a rise in black economic wealth and an emerging black middle class. [ 34 ]  Other problems are crime, corruption, and  HIV / AIDS .   At the start of 2000, then President Thabo Mbeki vowed to promote economic growth and foreign investment by relaxing restrictive labour laws, stepping up the pace of  privatisation , and cutting unneeded governmental spending. His policies face strong opposition from organised  labour . South Africa is also the largest energy producer and consumer on the continent. South Africa is a popular tourist destination, and a substantial amount of revenue comes from tourism. [ 35 ]  Among the main attractions are the diverse and picturesque culture, the game reserves and the highly regarded local wines.   The South African  rand  (ZAR), is the most actively traded emerging  market currency  in the world. It has joined an elite club of fifteen currencies, the  Continuous linked settlement  (CLS), where forex transactions are settled immediately, lowering the risks of transacting across  time zones . The rand was the best-performing currency against the  United States dollar  (USD) between 2002 and 2005, according to the  Bloomberg  Currency Scorecard.   The volatility of the  rand  has affected economic activity, falling sharply during 2001 and hitting a historic low of 13.85  ZAR  to the  USD , raising fears of inflation, and causing the Reserve Bank to increase  interest rates . The rand has since recovered, trading at 7.13 ZAR to the dollar as of January 2008. However, as exporters are put under considerable pressure from a stronger domestic currency, many call for government intervention to help soften the rand.   Refugees from poorer neighbouring countries include many immigrants from the DRC, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Malawi and others, representing a large portion of the informal sector. With high unemployment levels amongst poorer South Africans,  xenophobia  is prevalent and many people born in South Africa feel resentful of immigrants who are seen to be depriving the native population of jobs, a feeling which has been given credibility by the fact that many South African employers have employed migrants from other countries for lower pay than South African citizens, especially in the  construction ,  tourism ,  agriculture  and  domestic service  industries. Illegal immigrants are also heavily involved in informal trading. [ 36 ]  However, many immigrants to South Africa continue to live in poor conditions, and the South African immigration policy has become increasingly restrictive since 1994. [ 37 ]   Principal international trading partners of South Africa  besides other African countries  include  Germany ,  Japan ,  Switzerland , the  United Kingdom , and the  United States . Chief exports include  corn ,  diamonds ,  fruits ,  gold ,  metals  and  minerals ,  sugar , and  wool .  Machinery  and transportation equipment make up more than one-third of the value of the countrys imports. Other imports include  chemicals , manufactured goods, and  petroleum .     Electricity crisis   After unsuccessful attempts by the government to encourage private construction of electricity generation capacity, in 2007 the state-owned electricity supplier ( Eskom ) started experiencing a lack of capacity in the electrical generating and reticulation infrastructure. This led to an inability to meet the routine demands of industry and consumers, resulting in countrywide  rolling blackouts . Initially the lack of capacity was triggered by a failure at  Koeberg nuclear power station , but since then a general lack of capacity became evident. The supplier has been widely criticised for failing to adequately plan for and construct sufficient electrical generating capacity, [ 38 ]  although ultimately the government has admitted that it is at fault for refusing to approve funding for investment in infrastructure. [ 39 ]     Agriculture          Workers planting on a farm in the central area of  Mpumalanga .               Farm  workers.       South Africa has a large agricultural sector and is a net exporter of  farming  products. There are almost a thousand  agricultural cooperatives  and  agribusinesses  throughout the country, and agricultural exports have constituted 8% of South African total exports for the past five years. The agricultural industry contributes around 10% of formal employment, relatively low compared to other parts of Africa, as well as providing work for casual labourers and contributing around 2.6% of  GDP  for the nation. [ 40 ]  However, due to the  aridity  of the land, only 13.5% can be used for crop production, and only 3% is considered high potential land. [ 41 ]   Although the commercial farming sector is relatively well developed, people in some rural areas still survive on  subsistence agriculture . It is the eighth largest wine producer in the world, and the eleventh largest producer of sunflower seed. South Africa is a net exporter of agricultural products and foodstuffs, the largest number of exported items being  sugar ,  grapes ,  citrus ,  nectarines ,  wine  and  deciduous  fruit. The largest locally produced crop is  maize  (corn), and it has been estimated that 9 million tons are produced every year, with 7.4 million tons being consumed.  Livestock  are also popular on South African farms, with the country producing 85% of all meat consumed. The dairy industry consists of around 4,300 milk producers providing employment for 60,000 farm workers and contributing to the livelihoods of around 40,000 others. [ 42 ]   In recent years, the agricultural sector has introduced several reforms, some of which are controversial, such as  land reform  and the deregulation of the market for agricultural products. Land reform has been criticised both by farmers' groups and by landless workers, the latter alleging that the pace of change has not been fast enough, and the former alleging racist treatment and expressing concerns that a similar situation to  Zimbabwe's land reform policy  may develop, [ 43 ]  a fear exacerbated by comments made by  deputy president , the deputy president of South Africa. [ 44 ] [ 45 ]  The sector continues to face problems, with increased foreign competition and crime being two of the major challenges for the industry. The government has been accused of either putting in too much effort [ 46 ] , or not enough effort [ 47 ] , to tackle the problem of  farm attacks  as opposed to other forms of violent crime.   Another issue which affects South African agriculture is environmental damage caused by misuse of the land and global climate change. South Africa is unusually vulnerable to climate change and resultant diminution of surface waters. Some predictions show surface water supply could decrease by 60% by the year 2070 in parts of the Western Cape. [ 48 ]  To reverse the damage caused by land mismanagement, the government has supported a scheme which promotes  sustainable development  and the use of natural resources. [ 49 ]  Maize production, which contributes to a 36% majority of the gross value of South Africas field crops, has also experienced negative effects due to climate change. The estimated value of loss, which takes into consideration scenarios with and without the carbon dioxide fertilization effect [2]  ,ranges between 10s to 100s of millions of Rands.

The western half of South Africa is sparsely populated, while the eastern half has a high  population  concentration.              The many migrations that formed the modern  Rainbow Nation .       South Africa is a nation of more than 48 million people of diverse origins,  cultures ,  languages , and  religions . The last  census  was held in 2001 and the next will be in 2011.  Statistics South Africa  provided five  racial  categories by which people could classify themselves, the last of which, ""unspecified/other"" drew negligible responses, and these results were omitted. [ 51 ]  The 2006 midyear estimated figures for the other categories were  Black African  at 79.5%,  White  at 9.2%,  Coloured  at 8.9%, and  Indian or Asian  at 2.5%. [ 52 ]  Even though the population of South Africa has increased in the past decade [ 51 ] [ 53 ]  (primarily due to immigration), the country had an annual population growth rate of 0.501% in 2008 (CIA est.), including immigration. [ 54 ]  South Africa is home to an estimated 5 million  illegal immigrants , including some 3 million  Zimbabweans . [ 55 ] [ 56 ] [ 57 ]  A series of  anti-immigrant riots  occurred in South Africa beginning on 11 May 2008. [ 58 ] [ 59 ]   By far the major part of the population classified itself as African or black, but it is not culturally or linguistically homogeneous. Major ethnic groups include the  Zulu ,  Xhosa ,  Basotho  (South Sotho),  Bapedi  (North Sotho),  Venda ,  Tswana ,  Tsonga ,  Swazi  and  Ndebele , all of which speak  Bantu languages  (see  Bantu peoples of South Africa ).   Some, such as the Zulu, Xhosa, Bapedi and Venda groups, are unique to South Africa. Other groups are distributed across the borders with neighbours of South Africa: The  Basotho  group is also the major ethnic group in  Lesotho . The  Tswana  ethnic group constitute the majority of the population of  Botswana . The  Swazi  ethnic group is the major ethnic group in  Swaziland . The  Ndebele  ethnic group is also found in  Matabeleland  in  Zimbabwe , where they are known as the  Matabele . These Ndebele people are the descendants of a Zulu faction under the warrior  Mzilikazi  that escaped persecution from  Shaka  by migrating to their current territory. The  Tsonga  ethnic group is also found in southern  Mozambique , where they are known as the Shangaan.   The white population is not ethnically homogenous and descend from many ethnic groups:  Dutch ,  Flemish ,  Portuguese , German, French  Huguenot , English, Irish, Italian, Scottish and  Welsh . Culturally and linguistically, they are divided into the  Afrikaners , who speak  Afrikaans , and English-speaking groups, many of whom are descended from British and Irish immigrants (see  Anglo-African ). Many small communities that have immigrated over the last century retain the use of other languages. The  white population  is on the decrease due to a low birth rate and emigration; as a factor in their decision to emigrate, many cite the high  crime  rate and the  affirmative action  policies of the government. Since 1994, approximately 1 000 000 white South Africans have permanently emigrated. [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ] [ 63 ]  Despite high emigration levels, a high level of non-South African white immigrants have settled in the country, in particular from countries such as  Britain  and  Zimbabwe . For example, by 2005, an estimated 212 000 British citizens were residing in South Africa. Since 2003, the numbers of British migrants coming to South Africa has risen by 50%. An estimated 20 000 British migrants moved to South Africa in 2007. There have also been a significant number of  white Zimbabwean  arrivals, fleeing their home country in light of the economic and political problems currently facing the country. As well as recent arrivals, a significant number of white Zimbabweans emigrated to South Africa in the wake of independence in Zimbabwe in 1980. Some of the more nostalgic members of the community are known in popular culture as "" Whenwes "", because of their nostalgia for their lives in  Rhodesia  ""when we were in Rhodesia"". [ 64 ]   The term  Coloured  is still largely used for the people of mixed race descended from slaves brought in from East and Central Africa, the indigenous  Khoisan  who lived in the  Cape  at the time, Bantus, Whites (mostly the  Dutch / Afrikaner  and British settlers) as well as an admixture of  Javanese ,  Malay , Indian,  Malagasy  and Asian blood (such as  Burmese ). The majority speak Afrikaans. Khoisan is a term used to describe two separate groups, physically similar: light-skinned and small in stature. The  Khoikhoi , who were called  Hottentots  by the Europeans, were pastoralists and were annihilated; the San, called  Bushmen  by the Europeans, were hunter-gatherers. Within the Coloured community, more recent immigrants will also be found: Coloureds from the former  Rhodesia  (now  Zimbabwe );  Namibia  and immigrants of mixed descent from India and  Burma  ( Anglo-Indians / Anglo-Burmese ) who were welcomed to the Cape when India and Burma received their Independence.   The major part of the South African  Asian  population is Indian in origin (see  Indian South Africans ); many of them descended from indentured workers brought in the nineteenth century to work on the  sugar   plantations  of the eastern coastal area then known as  Natal . There is also a significant group of  Chinese South Africans  (approximately 100,000 individuals) and  Vietnamese  South Africans (approximately 50,000 individuals). In 2008, the Pretoria High Court has ruled that Chinese South Africans who arrived before 1994 are to be reclassified as  Coloureds . As a result of this ruling, about 12,000 - 15,000  [ 65 ] ethnically Chinese citizens who arrived before 1994, numbering 3%-5% of the total Chinese population in the country, will be able to benefit from government  BEE  policies. [ 66 ]   South Africa hosts a sizeable refugee and asylum seeker population. According to the  World Refugee Survey 2008 , published by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, this population numbered approximately 144,700 in 2007. [ 67 ]  Groups of refugees and asylum seekers numbering over 10,000 included people from  Zimbabwe  (48,400), The  Democratic Republic of the Congo  (24,800), and  Somalia  (12,900). [ 67 ]  These populations mainly lived in Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban, Cape Town, and Port Elizabeth. [ 67 ]     Science and technology   Several important scientific and technological developments have originated in South Africa.  The first human to human heart transplant was performed by cardiac surgeon  Christiaan Barnard  at  Groote Schuur Hospital  in December 1967  .  Max Theiler  developed a vaccine against Yellow Fever,  Allan McLeod Cormack  pioneered x-ray  Computed tomography , and  Aaron Klug  developed crystallographic electron microscopy techniques. These advancements were all recognized with  Nobel Prizes .  Sydney Brenner  won most recently, in 2002, for his pioneering work in  molecular biology .   Mark Shuttleworth  founded an early Internet security company  Thawte , that was subsequently bought out by world-leader  VeriSign . Despite government efforts to encourage entrepreneurship in biotechnology, IT and other high technology fields, no other notable groundbreaking companies have been founded in South Africa. However, it is the expressed objective of the government to transition the economy to be more reliant on high technology, based on the realization that South African cannot compete with Far Eastern economies in manufacturing, nor can the republic rely on its mineral wealth in perpetuity.   South Africa has cultivated a burgeoning astronomy community. It hosts the  Southern African Large Telescope , the largest optical telescope in the southern hemisphere. South Africa is currently building the  Karoo Array Telescope  as a pathfinder for the $20 billion  Square Kilometer Array  project. South Africa is a finalist, with Australia, to be the host of the SKA.     Society and culture       Main article:  Culture of South Africa              Decorated houses,  Drakensberg Mountains              Traditional  South African cuisine .       It may be argued that there is no ""single"" culture in South Africa because of its ethnic diversity. Today, the diversity in foods from many cultures is enjoyed by all and especially marketed to tourists who wish to sample the large variety of South African cuisine. In addition to  food ,  music  and  dance  feature prominently.   South African cuisine  is heavily  meat-based  and has spawned the distinctively South African social gathering known as a  braai , or barbecue. South Africa has also developed into a major  wine  producer, with some of the best  vineyards  lying in valleys around  Stellenbosch ,  Franschoek ,  Paarl  and  Barrydale . [ 68 ]   There is great diversity in music from South Africa. Many black musicians who sang in Afrikaans or English during apartheid have since begun to sing in traditional African languages, and have developed a unique style called  Kwaito . Of note is  Brenda Fassie , who launched to fame with her song ""Weekend Special"", which was sung in English. More famous traditional musicians include  Ladysmith Black Mambazo , while the  Soweto String Quartet  performs classic music with an African flavour. White and Coloured South African singers are historically influenced by European musical styles including such western metal bands such as  Seether  (formerly Saron Gas). South Africa has produced world-famous jazz musicians, notably  Hugh Masekela ,  Jonas Gwangwa ,  Abdullah Ibrahim ,  Miriam Makeba ,  Jonathan Butler ,  Chris McGregor , and  Sathima Bea Benjamin .  Afrikaans  music covers multiple genres, such as the  contemporary   Steve Hofmeyr  and the  punk rock  band  Fokofpolisiekar . Crossover artists such as  Johnny Clegg  and his bands  Juluka  and  Savuka  have enjoyed various success underground, publicly, and abroad.   The South African black majority still has a substantial number of rural inhabitants who lead largely impoverished lives. It is among these people, however, that cultural traditions survive most strongly; as blacks have become increasingly  urbanised  and  westernised , aspects of traditional culture have declined. Urban blacks usually speak English or  Afrikaans  in addition to their native tongue. There are smaller but still significant groups of speakers of  Khoisan languages  who are not included in the eleven official languages, but are one of the eight other officially recognised languages. There are small groups of speakers of  endangered languages , most of which are from the Khoi-San family, that receive no official status; however, some groups within South Africa are attempting to promote their use and revival.   The  middle class  lifestyle, predominantly of the white minority but with growing numbers of Black, Coloured and Indian people, [ 69 ]  is similar in many respects to that of people found in  Western Europe , North America and  Australasia . Members of the middle class often study and work abroad for greater exposure to the markets of the world.   Asians , predominantly of Indian origin, preserve their own cultural heritage, languages and religious beliefs, being either  Christian ,  Hindu  or  Sunni Muslim  and speaking English, with Indian languages like  Hindi ,  Telugu ,  Tamil  or  Gujarati  being spoken less frequently, but the majority of Indians being able to understand their mother tongue. The first Indians arrived on the famous  Truro ship  as  indentured labourers  in Natal to work the Sugar Cane Fields. There is a much smaller  Chinese  community in South Africa, although its numbers have increased due to immigration from  Republic of China  (Taiwan).   South Africa has also had a large influence in the  Scouting  movement, with many Scouting traditions and ceremonies coming from the experiences of  Robert Baden-Powell  (the founder of Scouting) during his time in South Africa as a military officer in the 1890s. The  South African Scout Association  was one of the first youth organisations to open its doors to youth and adults of all races in South Africa. This happened on 2 July 1977 at a conference known as  Quo Vadis . [ 70 ]   The South African music scene consists of  Kwaito , a new music genre that had developed in the mid 80s and has since developed to become the most popular social economical form of representation among the populous. Though some may argue that the political aspects of Kwaito has since diminished after  Apartheid , and the relative interest in politics has become a minor aspect of daily life. Some argue that in a sense,  Kwaito  is in fact a political force that shows activism in its apolitical actions. Today, major corporations like  Sony ,  BMG , and  EMI  have appeared on the South African scene to produce and distribute  Kwaito  music. Due to its overwhelming popularity, as well as the general influence of DJs, who are among the top 5 most influential types of people within the country,  Kwaito  has taken over radio, television, and magazines. [ 71 ]   Kwaito , much like most hip-hop has its own local flavor and originality. However, unlike when hip-hop first burst on the scene as a politically driven and rebellious underground movement, South Africans wanted to create a happier vibe. As the post-apartheid fog cleared, South African youth found their ""own voice in a style of music known as kwaito, spawning a new (and profitable) industry"". [ 72 ]  According to TIMEeurope magazine, ""The kwaito sound now regularly incorporates traditional African music, jazz, gospel, and even rock guitar, most notably on Mandoza's 2000 hit Nkalakatha, one of the few kwaito records to cross over onto traditionally white radio"". [ 73 ]  In the kwaito, the samples from old school  Jamaican dancehall , European house, etc.,  tempos  are changed, beats are added, and urban street slang is also incorporated. This local flavor of music more recently has been attacked for its lack of ingenuity and its betrayal of its roots. The melodies and the incorporation of sex and dance have since become very similar to the American standard. In addition Kwaito has been criticised for its absence of influential lyrical content. As Kwaito is still a developing genre, and since the South African population is only around 48 million, sales of only 25,000 CDs are required for ""gold"" certification in South Africa. [ 72 ]     Religion       Main article:  Religion in South Africa               St. Mark 's Anglican Cathedral.       According to the latest 2001 national census, Christians accounted for 79.7% of the population. This includes  Zion Christian  11.1%,  Pentecostal  ( Charismatic ) 8.2%,  Roman Catholic  7.1%,  Methodist  6.8%,  Dutch Reformed  6.7%,  Anglican  3.8%, and other Christian 36%.  Islam  accounted for 1.5% of the population,  Hinduism  about 1.3%, and  Judaism  0.2%. 15.1% had no religious affiliation, 2.3% were other and 1.4% were unspecified. [ 74 ] [ 75 ]   African Indigenous Churches were the largest of the  Christian  groups. It was believed that many of these persons who claimed no affiliation with any organised religion adhered to  traditional indigenous religions . Many peoples have  syncretic  religious practices combining Christian and indigenous influences. [ 76 ]   Islam in South Africa  itself is not known to pre-date the colonial period, despite the isolated contact neighbouring  Mozambique  had with  Arab  and  East African  traders. [ citation needed ]  There is no evidence that Islam was known to the  Zulu ,  Swazi , or  Xhosa  of the east coast prior to the colonial era. Many South African Muslims are described as  Coloureds , notably in the  Western Cape , especially those whose ancestors came as slaves from the Indonesian archipelago (the  Cape Malays ). Others are described as  Indians , notably in  KwaZulu-Natal , including those whose ancestors came as traders from  South Asia ; they have been joined by others from other parts of Africa as well as white or black South African converts. It is estimated that  Islam  is the fastest growing religion of conversion in the country, [ 77 ]  with the number of black  Muslims  growing sixfold, from 12,000 in 1991 to 74,700 in 2004. [ 78 ]   Hinduism  dates back to British Colonial period primarily but later waves of continuous immigrants from India have contributed to a sizable Hindu population. Most Hindus are ethnically South Asian but there are many who come from mixed racial stock and many are converts with the efforts of Hindu missionaries such as ISKCON. Other religions in smaller numbers are  Sikhism ,  Jainism  and  Bah' Faith . [ 75 ]     Languages       Main article:  Languages of South Africa              Map showing principal South African languages by municipality. Lighter shades indicate a non-majority  plurality .             Afrikaans          Northern Sotho          Southern Sotho          Swati          Tsonga            Tswana          Venda          Xhosa          Zulu               South Africa has eleven  official languages : [ 79 ]   Sepedi ,  Sesotho ,  Setswana ,  siSwati ,  Tshivenda ,  Xitsonga ,  Afrikaans ,  English ,  isiNdebele ,  isiXhosa  and  isiZulu . In this regard it is  second only to India  in number. While each language is formally equal to every other, some languages are spoken more than others. According to the 2001 National Census, the three most spoken first home languages are Zulu (23.8%), Xhosa (17.6%) and Afrikaans (13.3%). [ 51 ]  Despite the fact that English is recognised as the language of commerce and science, it was spoken by only 8.2% of South Africans at home in 2001, an even lower percentage than in 1996 (8.6%). [ 51 ]   There are  eleven official names  for South Africa, one in each of the official national languages. The country also recognises eight non-official languages:  Fanagalo ,  Khoe ,  Lobedu ,  Nama ,  Northern Ndebele ,  Phuthi ,  San  and  South African Sign Language . [ citation needed ]  These non-official languages may be used in certain official uses in limited areas where it has been determined that these languages are prevalent. Nevertheless, their populations are not such that they require nationwide recognition.   Many of the ""unofficial languages"" of the  San  and  Khoikhoi  people contain regional  dialects  stretching northward into Namibia and Botswana, and elsewhere. These people, who are a physically distinct population from other Africans, have their own cultural identity based on their  hunter-gatherer  societies. They have been marginalised to a great extent, and many of their languages are in danger of becoming  extinct .   Many white South Africans also speak other European languages, such as  Portuguese  (also spoken by Angolan and Mozambican blacks), German, and  Greek , while some  Asians  and  Indians  in South Africa speak  South Asian  languages, such as  Tamil ,  Hindi ,  Gujarati ,  Urdu  and  Telugu .  French  is still widely spoken by French South Africans especially in places like  Franschhoek , where many South Africans are of French origin. South African French is spoken by less than 10,000 individuals. Congolese French is also spoken in South Africa by migrants.

South Africa produced  Formula 1  motor racing's 1979 world champion  Jody Scheckter .   South Africa hosted and won the  1995 Rugby World Cup  at their first attempt and again won the  2007 Rugby World Cup  in  France . South Africa was only allowed to participate from 1995 since the end of  Apartheid . It followed the 1995 Rugby World Cup by hosting and winning the  1996 African Cup of Nations  football tournament. It also hosted the  2003 Cricket World Cup  and the  2007 World Twenty20 Championship . South Africa will be the host nation for the  2010 FIFA World Cup , which will be the first time the tournament is held on the African continent.   In 2004, the swim team of  Roland Schoeman ,  Lyndon Ferns ,  Darian Townsend  and  Ryk Neethling  won the gold medal at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, simultaneously breaking the world record in the 4x100 freestyle relay.  Penny Heyns  won Olympic Gold in the 1996  Atlanta Olympic Games .   In golf,  Gary Player  is generally regarded as one of the greatest golfers of all time, having won the  Career Grand Slam , one of five golfers to have done so. Other South African golfers to have successfully won a major tournament include  Bobby Locke ,  Ernie Els ,  Retief Goosen  and  Trevor Immelman .     Current issues     HIV/AIDS       Main article:  HIV/AIDS in South Africa       The spread of  AIDS  (acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome) is an alarming problem in South Africa with up to 31% of pregnant women found to be HIV infected in 2005 and the infection rate among adults estimated at 20%. [ 80 ]  The link between HIV, a virus spread primarily by sexual contact, and AIDS was long denied by prior president  Thabo Mbeki  and then health minister  Manto Tshabalala-Msimang , who insisted that the many deaths in the country are due to malnutrition, and hence poverty, and not HIV. [ 81 ]  In 2007, in response to international pressure, the government made efforts to fight AIDS. [ 82 ]  In September 2008 Thabo Mbeki was ousted by the ANC and  Kgalema Motlanthe  was appointed for the interim. One of Mr. Motlanthe's first actions was to replace Mrs. Tshabalala-Msimang with the current minister,  Barbara Hogan .   AIDS affects mainly those who are sexually active and is far more prevalent in the black population. Most deaths are people who are also economically active, resulting in many families losing their primary wage earners. This has resulted in many 'AIDS orphans' who in many cases depend on the state for care and financial support. [ 83 ]  It is estimated that there are 1,200,000 orphans in South Africa. [ 83 ]  Many elderly people also lose the support from lost younger members of their family. Roughly 5 million people are infected with the disease. [ 82 ]     Crime       Main article:  Crime in South Africa               Prison  buildings on  Robben Island       According to a survey for the period 19982000 compiled by the  United Nations , South Africa was ranked second for  murder  and first for  assaults  and  rapes  per capita. [ 84 ]  Total crime per capita is 10th out of the 60 countries in the data set.   Crime  has had a pronounced effect on society: many middle-class South Africans moved into  gated communities , abandoning the central business districts of some cities for the relative security of suburbs. This effect is most pronounced in  Johannesburg , although the trend is noticeable in other cities as well. [ citation needed ]  Many emigrants from South Africa also state that crime was a big motivator for them to leave.  Crime against the farming community  has continued to be a major problem. [ 85 ]     Skills migration   Along with many African nations, South Africa has been experiencing a "" brain drain "" in the past 20 years. This is believed to be potentially damaging for the regional economy, [ 86 ]  and is almost certainly detrimental for the well-being of the majority of people reliant on the healthcare infrastructure, given the HIV/AIDS epidemic. [ 87 ]  The skills drain in South Africa tends to demonstrate racial contours (naturally given the skills distribution legacy of South Africa) and has thus resulted in large white South African communities abroad. [ 88 ]     Xenophobia       Main article:  Xenophobia in South Africa       In May 2008 long standing state hostility to African migrants exploded in a series of pogroms that left up to 100 people dead and 100,000 displaced.

The Soviet  Union invaded in 1979, but was forced to withdraw 10 years later by anti-Communist  mujahidin forces supplied and trained by the US, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and others.    Fighting subsequently continued among the various mujahidin factions, giving rise  to a state of warlordism that eventually spawned the Taliban.   Backed by foreign sponsors, the Taliban developed as a political force and eventually  seized power. The Taliban were able to capture most of the country, aside from  Northern Alliance strongholds primarily in the northeast, until US and allied  military action in support of the opposition following the 11 September 2001 terrorist  attacks forced the group's downfall. In late 2001, major leaders from the Afghan  opposition groups and diaspora met in Bonn, Germany, and agreed on a plan for  the formulation of a new government structure that resulted in the inauguration  of Hamid KARZAI as Chairman of the Afghan Interim Authority (AIA) on 22 December  2001.   The AIA held a nationwide Loya Jirga (Grand Assembly) in June 2002, and KARZAI  was elected President by secret ballot of the Transitional Islamic State of Afghanistan  (TISA). The Transitional Authority has an 18-month mandate to hold a nationwide  Loya Jirga to adopt a constitution and a 24-month mandate to hold nationwide elections.  In December 2002, the TISA marked the one-year anniversary of the fall of the  Taliban.   In addition to occasionally violent political jockeying and ongoing military action  to root out remaining terrorists and Taliban elements, the country suffers from  enormous poverty, a crumbling infrastructure, and widespread land mines.
