(Other components, typically mandated and/or restricted by local governments, optionally include pumps, alarms,  sand filters , and clarified liquid effluent disposal means such as a  septic drain field , ponds, or  peat moss  beds.) Septic systems are a type of On-Site Sewage Facility ( OSSF ). In  North America  approximately 25% of the population relies on septic tanks; this can include  suburbs  and small towns as well as  rural  areas. ( Indianapolis  is an example of a large city where much of the city's neighborhoods are still on separate septic systems) In Europe they are generally limited to rural areas only.   The term ""septic"" refers to the  anaerobic bacterial  environment that develops in the tank and which decomposes or mineralizes the waste discharged into the tank. Adding a supplemental bacterial agent to the tank may accelerate the digestion of solids in the tank. Septic tanks can be coupled with other  on-site wastewater treatment  units such as  biofilters  or aerobic systems involving artificial forced  aeration . [ 1 ]   Periodic  preventive maintenance  is required to remove the irreducible solids which settle and gradually fill the tank, reducing its efficiency. In most jurisdictions this maintenance is required by law, yet often not enforced. Those who ignore the requirement will eventually be faced with extremely costly repairs when solids escape the tank and destroy the clarified liquid effluent disposal means. A properly cared-for system, on the other hand, can last for decades and possibly a lifetime.

These pipe connections are generally made via a T pipe which allows liquid entry and egress without disturbing any crust on the surface. Today the design of the tank usually incorporates two chambers (each of which is equipped with a manhole cover) which are separated by means of a dividing wall which has openings located about midway between the floor and roof of the tank.   Wastewater enters the first chamber of the tank, allowing solids to settle and scum to float. The settled solids are anaerobically digested reducing the volume of solids. The liquid component flows through the dividing wall into the second chamber where further settlement takes place with the excess liquid then draining in a relatively clear condition from the outlet into the  leach field , also referred to as a drain field, or seepage field, depending upon locality.          Septic tank lift pump alarm system located in a house.       The remaining impurities decompose in the soil, and the water is eliminated through  percolation  into the  soil , and eventually taken up through the  root  system of  plants  or added to the  groundwater . A piping network, often constructed in a stone filled trench (see  weeping tile ), distributes the wastewater throughout the field with multiple drainage holes in the network. The size of the  leach field  is proportional to the volume of wastewater and inversely proportional to the porosity of the drainage field. The entire septic system can operate by gravity alone, or where topographic considerations require, with inclusion of a lift  pump .   An  Imhoff tank  is a two-stage septic system where the sludge is digested in a separate tank. This avoids mixing digested sludge with incoming sewage. Also, some septic tank designs have a second stage where the  effluent  from the anaerobic first stage is aerated before it drains into the seepage field.   Waste that is not decomposed by the anaerobic digestion eventually has to be removed from the septic tank, or else the septic tank fills up and undecomposed wastewater discharges directly to the drainage field. Not only is this bad for the environment, but if the sludge overflows the septic tank into the leach field, it may clog the leach field piping or the soil porosity itself, requiring expensive repairs.   How often the septic tank has to be emptied depends on the volume of the tank relative to the input of solids, the amount of indigestible solids and the ambient temperature (as anaerobic digestion occurs more efficiently at higher temperatures). The required frequency varies greatly depending on jurisdiction, usage, and system characteristics. Some health authorities require tanks to be emptied at prescribed intervals, while others leave it up to the determination of the inspector. Some systems require pumping every few years or sooner, while others may be able to go 10-20 years between pumpings. Contrary to what many believe, there is no ""rule of thumb"" for how often tanks should be emptied. An older system with an undersized tank that is being used by a large family will require much more frequent pumping than a new system used by only a few people. Anaerobic decomposition is rapidly re-started when the tank re-fills.   A properly designed and normally operating septic system is odour free and, besides periodic inspection and pumping of the septic tank, should last for decades with no maintenance.   A well designed and maintained concrete, fibreglass or plastic tank should last about 50 years. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Potential problems     Excessive dumping of cooking oils and grease can fill up the upper portion of the septic tank and can cause the inlet drains to block. Oils and grease are often difficult to degrade and can cause odor problems and difficulties with the periodic emptying.   Flushing non-biodegradable hygiene products such as sanitary towels and cotton buds will rapidly fill or clog a septic tank; these materials should not be disposed of in this way.   The use of  waste macerators or grinders  for disposal of waste food can cause a rapid overload of the system and early failure.   Certain chemicals may damage the working of a septic tank, especially pesticides, herbicides, materials with high concentrations of bleach or caustic soda (lye) or any other inorganic materials such as paints or solvents.   Roots from trees and shrubbery growing above the tank or the drain field may clog and or rupture them.   Playgrounds and storage buildings may cause damage to a tank and the drainage field. In addition, covering the drainage field with an impervious surface, such as a driveway or parking area, will seriously affect its efficiency and possibly damage the tank and absorption system.   Excessive water entering the system will overload it and cause it to fail. Checking for plumbing leaks and practising water conservation will help the system's operation.   Even well maintained septic tanks release  mucus -producing anaerobic gut bacteria to the drainage field. The mucus ""slime"" will slowly clog the soil pores surrounding the drain pipe and percolation can slow to the point where backups or surfacing effluent can occur. This slime is called biomat and such a failure is referred to as ""Biomat failure"" [ 3 ] .   If the system is damaged or malfunctions, contact your local health or environmental authority before attempting any repairs. Improper repair can result in costly mistakes and potential health hazards.   Septic tanks by themselves are ineffective at removing  nitrogen  compounds that can cause  algae blooms  in receiving waters; this can be remedied by using a nitrogen-reducing technology. [1]       [ edit ]   Environmental issues   Some pollutants, especially  sulfates , under the anaerobic conditions of septic tanks, are reduced to  hydrogen sulfide , a  pungent  and  toxic  gas. Likewise,  nitrates  and  organic nitrogen compounds  are reduced to  ammonia . Because of the anaerobic conditions,  fermentation  processes take place, which ultimately generate  carbon dioxide  and  methane .   The fermentation processes cause the contents of a septic tank to be anoxic with a low  redox  potential, which keeps  phosphate  in a soluble and thus mobilized form. Because phosphate can be the limiting nutrient for plant growth in many ecosystems, the discharge from a septic tank into the environment can trigger prolific plant growth including algal blooms which can also include blooms of potentially toxic  cyanobacteria .   Soil capacity to retain phosphorus is large compared with the load through a normal residential septic tank. An exception occurs when  septic drain fields  are located in sandy or coarser soils on property adjoining a water body. Because of limited particle surface area, these soils can become saturated with phosphate. Phosphate will progress beyond the treatment area, posing a threat of  eutrophication  to surface waters. [ 4 ]   In areas with high population density, groundwater pollution levels often exceed acceptable limits. Some small towns are facing the costs of building very expensive centralized wastewater treatment systems because of this problem, owing to the high cost of extended collection systems.   To slow development, building moratoriums and limits on the  subdivision  of property are often imposed. Ensuring existing septic tanks are functioning properly can also be helpful for a limited time, but becomes less effective as a primary remediation strategy as population density increases.   Trees in the vicinity of a concrete septic tank have the potential to penetrate the tank as the system ages and the concrete begins to develop cracks and small leaks. Tree roots can cause serious flow problems due to plugging and blockage of drain pipes, but the trees themselves tend to grow extremely vigorously due to the continuous influx of nutrients into the septic system.

Package                      on Septic Systems                     Did                      you know about 25 percent of the U.S. population relies on                      decentralized—or onsite—wastewater treatment systems?                      About 95 percent of the onsite wastewater disposal systems                      are septic systems.                         What                      is a septic system?                       A                      septic system is a highly efficient, self-contained, underground                      wastewater treatment system. Because septic systems treat                      and dispose of household wastewater onsite, they are often                      more economical than centralized sewer systems in rural areas                      where lot sizes are larger and houses are spaced widely apart.                      Septic systems are also simple in design, which make them                      generally less expensive to install and maintain. And by using                      natural processes to treat the wastewater onsite, usually                      in a homeowner's backyard, septic systems don't require the                      installation of miles of sewer lines, making them less disruptive                      to the environment.                      A                      septic system consists of two main parts-a septic tank and                      a drainfield. The septic tank is a watertight box, usually                      made of concrete or fiberglass, with an inlet and outlet pipe.                      Wastewater flows from the home to the septic tank through                      the sewer pipe. The septic tank treats the wastewater naturally                      by holding it in the tank long enough for solids and liquids                      to separate. The wastewater forms three layers inside the                      tank. Solids lighter than water (such as greases and oils)                      float to the top forming a layer of scum. Solids heavier than                      water settle at the bottom of the tank forming a layer of                      sludge. This leaves a middle layer of partially clarified                      wastewater.                      The                      layers of sludge and scum remain in the septic tank where                      bacteria found naturally in the wastewater work to break the                      solids down. The sludge and scum that cannot be broken down                      are retained in the tank until the tank is pumped. The layer                      of clarified liquid flows from the septic tank to the drainfield                      or to a distribution device, which helps to uniformly distribute                      the wastewater in the drainfield. A standard drainfield (also                      known as a leachfield, disposal field, or a soil absorption                      system) is a series of trenches or a bed lined with gravel                      or course sand and buried one to three feet below the ground                      surface. Perforated pipes or drain tiles run through the trenches                      to distribute the wastewater. The drainfield treats the wastewater                      by allowing it to slowly trickle from the pipes out into the                      gravel and down through the soil. The gravel and soil act                      as biological filters.                      Top                       Septic                      System Maintenance                       If                      you own a septic system, it is important that it be properly                      maintained. How often you need to pump the solids out of your                      septic tank depends on three major factors:                                                                    the number of people in your household;                       the                        amount of wastewater generated (based on the number of people                        in the household and the amount of water used); and                        the                        volume of solids in the wastewater (e.g., using a garbage                        disposal will increase the amount of solids).                                          Although                      your septic tank absorption field generally does not require                      maintenance, you should adhere to the following rules to protect                      and prolong its functional life:                                            Do                        not drive over the absorption field with cars, trucks, or                        heavy equipment.                        Do                        not plant trees or shrubbery in the absorption field area,                        because the roots can get into the lines and plug them.                                               Do                        not cover the absorption field with hard surfaces, such                        as concrete or asphalt. Grass is the best cover, because                        it will help prevent erosion and help remove excess water.                                               Do                        divert surface runoff water from roofs, patios, driveways,                        and other areas away from the absorption field.                                          Homeowners                      wanting to take good care of their septic systems should make                      note of the following items that should never be flushed down                      the drain or toilet. These items can overtax or destroy the                      biological digestion taking place within the system or clog                      pumps and pipes.                      Take                      care not to flush the following:                                             hair                        combings                        coffee grounds                         dental floss                         disposable diapers                         kitty litter                         sanitary napkins                         tampons                         cigarette butts                         condoms                         gauze bandages                         fat, grease, or oil                         paper towels                                          and                        NEVER   flush                      chemicals that could contaminate surface and groundwater,                      such as:                                              paints                                                varnishes                         thinners                         waste oils                         photographic solutions                         pesticides                                          Top                       Septic                      System Brochures                     If                      you're looking for information on how to properly maintain                      your septic system, avoid potential system problems, or are                      planning on buying or selling a home with a septic system,                      look no further. The NSFC offers a series of three brochures                      about septic system operation and maintenance. These brochures                      describe how septic systems work and give some general guidelines                      to help protect the groundwater and prolong the life of your                      septic system.

Brown and M.V. Peart 2 Most homes in Florida are connected to a public sewage treatment system. However, over 1.3 million families (about 27% of Florida's housing units) live in rural and sparsely developed suburban areas not served with a public system. Properly sited, designed, constructed, and maintained septic systems can provide an efficient and economical wastewater treatment alternative to public sewer systems. People who have septic systems or who plan to buy property that has or will have a septic system should understand what the system does and how to use and maintain it.  WHAT DOES A SEPTIC SYSTEM DO?   Wastewater from homes is a by-product of most of the water-using processes carried on in the home. An average of 40 to 50 gallons of wastewater is produced per person per day. The purpose of on-site sewage systems is to dispose of these wastes and to treat the water so it will be safe when it reaches drinking water supplies or recreational waters. The septic system consists of more than just the septic tank itself. In fact, the largest part of the treatment of the wastewater actually takes place in the soil beneath the drainfield.  The Septic Tank   Wastewater flows through a pipe into the septic tank. Baffles or ""tees"" at the inlet and outlet of the tank slow the flow of water and prevent sewage from flowing directly through the tank ( Figure 1 ).     Figure 1.    A typical septic system.     Bacterial action within a septic tank helps to break down the solids in the wastewater that enter the tank. The tank must be large enough, and the rate of flow small enough, to ensure sufficient ""residence time"" of wastewater in the tank. Even when the tank is working properly and solids are being broken down at a rate sufficient to prevent their movement into the drainfield, partially digested solids and any materials that cannot be digested sink to the bottom of the tank and accumulate as sludge. Grease, foam, and lighter particles float to the surface and form a layer of scum. The exit baffle arrangement holds back sludge and scum while allowing a partially digested wastewater to flow out of the tank. It is important that sludge and scum not get out of the tank and into the drainfield as they can clog soil pores and cause the septic system to fail. If allowed to build up in the tank, the volume available to accommodate liquid is drastically reduced. Therefore, the tank must be pumped out periodically. Sizes of septic tanks that are required for different sizes of families and establishments are defined in Chapter 1OD-6 of the Florida Administrative Code, which sets the standards for on-site sewage disposal system design and installation in the state. With the exception of parts of extreme south Florida, the standards are uniform across the state. In addition, some counties have established rules that are more restrictive than state code. Information on state and county standards and their implications for individual systems may be obtained from the environmental health office of your county health unit.  The Distribution Box   Partially treated wastewater flows from the septic tank into a distribution box, or in some cases into a ""header pipe"". There, the wastewater is spread evenly into porous pipes arrayed in the absorption field. The distribution box may be attached directly to the septic tank or connected to it by a short length of pipe.  The Soil Absorption Field   The soil absorption field is the land area where the wastewater from the septic tank is spread into the soil. One of the most common types of soil absorption field has porous plastic pipe extending away from the distribution box in a series of two or more parallel trenches, usually 1-1/2 to 2 feet wide. In conventional, below ground systems, the trenches are 1-1/2 to 2 feet deep. The porous pipe is surrounded by gravel that fills the trench to within a foot or so of the ground surface. The gravel is covered by fabric material or building paper to prevent plugging. Some absorption fields must be placed at a shallower depth than this to compensate for some limiting soil condition such as a hardpan or high water table. In some cases they may even be placed partially or entirely in fill material that has been brought to the lot from elsewhere. Another type of drainfield consists of pipes that extend away from the distribution box not in trenches but in a single, gravel-filled bed that has several such porous pipes in it. As with trenches, the gravel in a bed is covered by fabric or other appropriate material. Usually the wastewater flows gradually downward into the gravel-filled trenches or bed. In some instances, however, as where the septic tank is lower than the drainfield, a pump must be installed in order to lift the wastewater up into the drainfield. Whether gravity flow or pumping is used to get wastewater into the drainfield, wastewater must be evenly distributed throughout the drainfield. It is important to ensure that the drainfield is installed with care to keep the porous pipe level, or at a very gradual downward slope away from the distribution box or pump chamber, according to specifications stipulated by local officials. Soil beneath the gravel-filled trenches or bed must be permeable so that wastewater and air can move through it and come in contact with each other. Good aeration is necessary to ensure that the proper chemical and microbiological processes will be occurring in the soil to cleanse the percolating wastewater of contaminants. A well-aerated soil also ensures slow travel and good contact between wastewater and soil.  SOIL CONSIDERATIONS   In former times the permeability of Florida soil was determined by a percolation test, or ""perk"" test. Such a test involved excavating a round hole in the soil at the site, filling the hole with water in a standard fashion, and measuring the subsequent rate of fall of the water level in the hole. However, the perk test has been de-emphasized as a site evaluation technique in Florida. Instead, Florida's septic system siting standards require that a site investigation be conducted. The site investigation includes examination of the soils for a variety of characteristics that will help to predict septic system performance during all seasons of the year. The two most important soil attributes that must be described and understood in such a site investigation are: (1) soil permeability; and (2) wet-season water table.  Soil Permeability   In assessing soil permeability, more than one auger boring must be made and the soil described down at least to the 5-foot depth. Features studied and described include: 1) soil texture (proportions of sand, silt, and clay); 2) potentially restrictive layers, such as claypans or chemically cemented layers; 3) layers of organic matter (muck) or gravel; 4) zones of contrasting soil materials; and 5) variation in these sorts of soil features across the site. If prohibited materials, such as hardpans, clay, muck, or gravel, are found in the 3-1/2 foot zone that will immediately underlie a proposed drainfield, then the unsuitable material must be excavated and replaced with appropriate fill material. Alternatively, depending on the water table and other conditions, the drainfield may be elevated above the unsuitable material by building a mound of permeable soil brought to the site from elsewhere. Or, where site conditions are extremely limiting, the permit may be denied altogether. Assuming that the soil is found to be suitable in the 3-1/2 foot zone under the proposed drainfield, or that suitable fill can be placed there, the suitability of these soil materials still must be known in order to determine the size of the drainfield. This is necessary to ensure that the drainfield will receive wastewater from the septic tank at a rate not exceeding the capacity of the soil to accept it. The permitting officer must: 1) estimate the daily flow of wastewater; 2) determine the size of septic tank needed; 3) estimate the permeability of the soil in the 3-1/2 foot zone under the drainfield; and 4) compute the required drainfield size from the estimated flow rate and the estimated soil permeability at the site. Generally, the more clayey soils will be found to have lower permeabilities and therefore will require larger drainfields. For example, a small home with sandy soils in its yard might be required to have only a 900-gallon tank and a drainfield with only 200 square feet of bottom. On the other hand, a large home (having greater wastewater flow) with more clayey (and therefore less permeable) soils might need a 1,200-gallon tank and a drainfield with 800 square feet of trench bottom.  Wet-Season Water Table Level   The other important soil feature that must be understood before a permit can be issued in Florida is the depth to which the water table rises in wet seasons. Once this is determined, the trench/bed bottom can be set at an elevation at least 2 feet above that wet-season water table level. The water table is the more-or-less horizontal boundary between unsaturated soil above and wet soil below. The depth to the water table varies greatly depending on location and on the nature of the soil and landscape at any given site. Another key factor controlling depth of the water table is the weather. After an extended rainy period, the water table is likely to be much higher in the soil than it would be in the same soil following a long drought. The behavior of the water table is further complicated by the presence or absence of water-using vegetation on a site. Ground that seems rather dry when investigated while natural vegetation is intact may become wetter after the trees are cleared for development. Site investigations need to proceed with the understanding that the depth to the water table is a dynamic feature of the soil. State septic system code requires that the depth to which the water table is likely to rise during wet seasons of most years be determined when site investigations are performed. Septic system design depends heavily on the depth of the wet-season water table. Code stipulates that the bottom of the gravel-filled trench or bed must be at least two feet above that depth. If the wet-season water table is estimated to be 24 inches below the ground surface, for example, then the drainfield must be designed so that its bottom is at or above the natural ground surface. In this case, fill material would have to be brought in to allow the burial of the drainfield with a 2-foot separation.  PERMITTING AND INSTALLING A SEPTIC SYSTEM   Since 1983, Florida's septic system siting standards have required a site investigation to be conducted that includes examination of the soils for a variety of characteristics. Knowing these characteristics will help to predict septic system performance during all seasons. Approval of the site also must take into consideration numerous other factors, including proximity of the site to surface waters and to drinking water supply wells. The system can only be located, sized, and otherwise designed when the characteristics of the site are known. The investigation must be conducted by a qualified person from the county health unit, or from another agency or firm approved by that county health unit. After the system is permitted and installed, but before it is covered with soil, it must receive final approval. Questions should be directed to your local county health unit.  MANAGING A HOME SEPTIC SYSTEM   The home septic system should have been originally designed and installed to meet the normal wastewater disposal needs of a certain size home, given the soil conditions on the site.  Controlling Volume of Wastewater   Sending wastewater to the tank too fast can cause solid materials to pass into the drainfield without undergoing gradual anaerobic digestion. Conservative water use should be practiced in the house to ensure slow movement of wastewater into the tank, reasonably complete digestion of solids, and slow trickling of wastewater from the tank to the drainfield. Try to avoid consecutive, extra-large loads of laundry, marathon showers, and other excessive uses that may send big surges of wastewater into the system. The brine solution and excess water from the backwash of a water softener probably will not harm most septic systems, although they could dictate the need for a slightly larger tank and drainfield. Water-saving devices available for toilets and shower heads are encouraged. Do not connect sump pump outlets or roof gutters to the system. It would be wise to make sure that any runoff from the roof, the driveway, and other impermeable surfaces is directed well away from the drainfield. Doing so will prevent extraordinary buildup of water in the drainfield. Using the system at or below its design capacity will help to ensure against failure that could cause backing up of wastewater into the house and/or environmental contamination of the yard, of nearby surface waters, or of underlying ground water.  Controlling Quality of Wastewater   The quality of wastewater — not just its quantity — is also important in ensuring proper septic system function. Fats and grease should never be poured down the drain. They can solidify in the lines and cause failure; they can cause excessive buildup of the floating scum layer in the septic tank itself; and they can get into the drainfield and surrounding soil and seal the system off altogether. Installation of garbage grinders is not encouraged in homes served by septic systems. If you have one, use it in moderation. Septic systems are intended to be used for the treatment and disposal of human wastes and wash waters that reasonably may be expected to come from the home. Allow household cleansers, disinfectants, and bleaches into the septic system only in moderation. Anything else does not belong in a septic system. Do not put any toxic or hazardous materials, such as paints, thinners, waste oils, photographic solutions, or poisons into a septic system; they will not be treated sufficiently to prevent contamination of water that returns to your local ground and/or surface waters. Other materials that cannot be decomposed in a septic system include coffee grounds, dental floss, disposable diapers, cat box litter, cigarette butts, sanitary napkins, tampons, plastics, facial tissues, and paper towels. Such materials merely increase the risk of plugging and necessitate more frequent cleaning.  Maintaining the Septic Tank   Slow buildups of sludge and scum are normal. Removal of these materials by periodic pumping and appropriate disposal is necessary to protect the absorption field from materials that will damage its effectiveness. Annual or biannual inspection of the septic tank is advisable to determine the thickness of the sludge and scum layers. A probe may be put into the tank from one of its access ports to make this determination. If the homeowner or other resident has any doubts about inspecting the septic tank, a private contractor who specializes in septic system cleaning and pumping should be contacted. Such a service will cost the homeowner some money, but it should be thought of as preventive maintenance. Additives that are marketed as septic tank cleaners, rejuvenators, or primers are not recommended. Strong chemicals can harm a septic system, and Florida's code prohibits the sale of organic chemical solvents for the purpose of degreasing or declogging septic systems.  Maintaining the Drainfield   Activities that help to maintain the septic tank itself will serve similarly to maintain the drainfield. If the tank is free of excessive sludge and if it is used well within its designed capacity, and if the quality of wastewater sent to it is proper, then the drainfield is likely to last for a long time without a major dig-out and repair. All this assumes that the wet-season water table is at least 2 feet below the bottom of the drainfield, and that the soil is adequately permeable. Additional measures that the homeowner can take include such things as: 1) do not allow vehicular traffic over the drainfield, which can compact the soil and possibly break drain lines; 2) try to position trees so that their roots will not enter the drainlines and plug them; and 3) keep a healthy grass cover over the system to prevent exposure of the soil and possible erosion around the drain lines.  REPAIRS TO YOUR SEPTIC SYSTEM   You may not know you have experienced a septic system failure until the first obvious signs show up in the yard, in the form of wet, smelly spots. Or, worse, the failure may cause the toilets and other drains to back up. Depending on the nature of the failure, repairs to a septic system can range widely in complexity and cost. One failure might turn out to require only a simple clearing of the household sewer lines to remove a stoppage. Another problem might be solved by having the septic tank pumped out. In other instances, significant repairs will be necessary to restore proper system function. These repairs may consist of enlarging the drainfield; rebuilding a broken distribution box; replacing the septic tank or drainfield; or splitting the wastewater stream so that ""black water"" (predominantly toilet wastes) goes to one septic system and ""gray water"" (predominantly laundry waste) goes to a separate septic system. Get price quotations from septic system contractors. Deal only with contractors who are duly registered by the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services. Check with your county health unit to verify that you are dealing with a properly registered contractor, to make sure that your repairs are being made according to standard, environmentally sound practices, and to ensure that county/state requirements are being followed.  CONCLUSION   We tend to think that our septic system is working as long as the plumbing seems to work and there's no smell in the yard or adjacent ditches. But is it? Environmental contamination may not be apparent and could go undetected for years until a drinking water supply is found to be contaminated — until water quality surveys show nearby lakes to be contaminated, or until other evidence of environmental contamination is assembled. The homeowner should be concerned not only with the hydraulic functioning of the system, but also with its environmental functioning. Ensure that your system is installed and operated in compliance with state and county codes. Have the tank inspected regularly, and pumped when necessary to avoid failure. Your attention to these concerns will help keep your system working properly and protect the environment at the same time. Septic system contractors are registered and regulated by the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services. If you have questions about who is properly registered in your area, direct your inquiries to your county health unit (listed in the phone book under County Government). Strive to understand the soils on your land. For information on the soils of your county, contact your Soil and Water Conservation District Office (usually listed under county government), the local office of the Cooperative Extension Service (also under county government), and the Natural Resources Conservation Service (listed under U.S. Department of Agriculture).

(Other components, typically mandated and/or restricted by local governments, optionally include pumps, alarms,  sand filters , and clarified liquid effluent disposal means such as a  septic drain field , ponds, or  peat moss  beds.) Septic systems are a type of On-Site Sewage Facility ( OSSF ). In  North America  approximately 25% of the population relies on septic tanks; this can include  suburbs  and small towns as well as  rural  areas. ( Indianapolis  is an example of a large city where much of the city's neighborhoods are still on separate septic systems) In Europe they are generally limited to rural areas only.   The term ""septic"" refers to the  anaerobic bacterial  environment that develops in the tank and which decomposes or mineralizes the waste discharged into the tank. Adding a supplemental bacterial agent to the tank may accelerate the digestion of solids in the tank. Septic tanks can be coupled with other  on-site wastewater treatment  units such as  biofilters  or aerobic systems involving artificial forced  aeration . [ 1 ]   Periodic  preventive maintenance  is required to remove the irreducible solids which settle and gradually fill the tank, reducing its efficiency. In most jurisdictions this maintenance is required by law, yet often not enforced. Those who ignore the requirement will eventually be faced with extremely costly repairs when solids escape the tank and destroy the clarified liquid effluent disposal means. A properly cared-for system, on the other hand, can last for decades and possibly a lifetime.

These pipe connections are generally made via a T pipe which allows liquid entry and egress without disturbing any crust on the surface. Today the design of the tank usually incorporates two chambers (each of which is equipped with a manhole cover) which are separated by means of a dividing wall which has openings located about midway between the floor and roof of the tank.   Wastewater enters the first chamber of the tank, allowing solids to settle and scum to float. The settled solids are anaerobically digested reducing the volume of solids. The liquid component flows through the dividing wall into the second chamber where further settlement takes place with the excess liquid then draining in a relatively clear condition from the outlet into the  leach field , also referred to as a drain field, or seepage field, depending upon locality.          Septic tank lift pump alarm system located in a house.       The remaining impurities decompose in the soil, and the water is eliminated through  percolation  into the  soil , and eventually taken up through the  root  system of  plants  or added to the  groundwater . A piping network, often constructed in a stone filled trench (see  weeping tile ), distributes the wastewater throughout the field with multiple drainage holes in the network. The size of the  leach field  is proportional to the volume of wastewater and inversely proportional to the porosity of the drainage field. The entire septic system can operate by gravity alone, or where topographic considerations require, with inclusion of a lift  pump .   An  Imhoff tank  is a two-stage septic system where the sludge is digested in a separate tank. This avoids mixing digested sludge with incoming sewage. Also, some septic tank designs have a second stage where the  effluent  from the anaerobic first stage is aerated before it drains into the seepage field.   Waste that is not decomposed by the anaerobic digestion eventually has to be removed from the septic tank, or else the septic tank fills up and undecomposed wastewater discharges directly to the drainage field. Not only is this bad for the environment, but if the sludge overflows the septic tank into the leach field, it may clog the leach field piping or the soil porosity itself, requiring expensive repairs.   How often the septic tank has to be emptied depends on the volume of the tank relative to the input of solids, the amount of indigestible solids and the ambient temperature (as anaerobic digestion occurs more efficiently at higher temperatures). The required frequency varies greatly depending on jurisdiction, usage, and system characteristics. Some health authorities require tanks to be emptied at prescribed intervals, while others leave it up to the determination of the inspector. Some systems require pumping every few years or sooner, while others may be able to go 10-20 years between pumpings. Contrary to what many believe, there is no ""rule of thumb"" for how often tanks should be emptied. An older system with an undersized tank that is being used by a large family will require much more frequent pumping than a new system used by only a few people. Anaerobic decomposition is rapidly re-started when the tank re-fills.   A properly designed and normally operating septic system is odour free and, besides periodic inspection and pumping of the septic tank, should last for decades with no maintenance.   A well designed and maintained concrete, fibreglass or plastic tank should last about 50 years. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Potential problems     Excessive dumping of cooking oils and grease can fill up the upper portion of the septic tank and can cause the inlet drains to block. Oils and grease are often difficult to degrade and can cause odor problems and difficulties with the periodic emptying.   Flushing non-biodegradable hygiene products such as sanitary towels and cotton buds will rapidly fill or clog a septic tank; these materials should not be disposed of in this way.   The use of  waste macerators or grinders  for disposal of waste food can cause a rapid overload of the system and early failure.   Certain chemicals may damage the working of a septic tank, especially pesticides, herbicides, materials with high concentrations of bleach or caustic soda (lye) or any other inorganic materials such as paints or solvents.   Roots from trees and shrubbery growing above the tank or the drain field may clog and or rupture them.   Playgrounds and storage buildings may cause damage to a tank and the drainage field. In addition, covering the drainage field with an impervious surface, such as a driveway or parking area, will seriously affect its efficiency and possibly damage the tank and absorption system.   Excessive water entering the system will overload it and cause it to fail. Checking for plumbing leaks and practising water conservation will help the system's operation.   Even well maintained septic tanks release  mucus -producing anaerobic gut bacteria to the drainage field. The mucus ""slime"" will slowly clog the soil pores surrounding the drain pipe and percolation can slow to the point where backups or surfacing effluent can occur. This slime is called biomat and such a failure is referred to as ""Biomat failure"" [ 3 ] .   If the system is damaged or malfunctions, contact your local health or environmental authority before attempting any repairs. Improper repair can result in costly mistakes and potential health hazards.   Septic tanks by themselves are ineffective at removing  nitrogen  compounds that can cause  algae blooms  in receiving waters; this can be remedied by using a nitrogen-reducing technology. [1]       [ edit ]   Environmental issues   Some pollutants, especially  sulfates , under the anaerobic conditions of septic tanks, are reduced to  hydrogen sulfide , a  pungent  and  toxic  gas. Likewise,  nitrates  and  organic nitrogen compounds  are reduced to  ammonia . Because of the anaerobic conditions,  fermentation  processes take place, which ultimately generate  carbon dioxide  and  methane .   The fermentation processes cause the contents of a septic tank to be anoxic with a low  redox  potential, which keeps  phosphate  in a soluble and thus mobilized form. Because phosphate can be the limiting nutrient for plant growth in many ecosystems, the discharge from a septic tank into the environment can trigger prolific plant growth including algal blooms which can also include blooms of potentially toxic  cyanobacteria .   Soil capacity to retain phosphorus is large compared with the load through a normal residential septic tank. An exception occurs when  septic drain fields  are located in sandy or coarser soils on property adjoining a water body. Because of limited particle surface area, these soils can become saturated with phosphate. Phosphate will progress beyond the treatment area, posing a threat of  eutrophication  to surface waters. [ 4 ]   In areas with high population density, groundwater pollution levels often exceed acceptable limits. Some small towns are facing the costs of building very expensive centralized wastewater treatment systems because of this problem, owing to the high cost of extended collection systems.   To slow development, building moratoriums and limits on the  subdivision  of property are often imposed. Ensuring existing septic tanks are functioning properly can also be helpful for a limited time, but becomes less effective as a primary remediation strategy as population density increases.   Trees in the vicinity of a concrete septic tank have the potential to penetrate the tank as the system ages and the concrete begins to develop cracks and small leaks. Tree roots can cause serious flow problems due to plugging and blockage of drain pipes, but the trees themselves tend to grow extremely vigorously due to the continuous influx of nutrients into the septic system.

In most jurisdictions this maintenance is required by law, yet often not enforced. Those who ignore the requirement will eventually be faced with extremely costly repairs when solids escape the tank and destroy the clarified liquid effluent disposal means. A properly cared-for system, on the other hand, can last for decades and possibly a lifetime.           Contents       1   Description   2   Potential problems   3   Environmental issues   4   See also   5   References   6   External links               [ edit ]   Description   A septic tank generally consists of tanks between the size of 1,000 and 2,000 gallons (4000 - 7500 litres) which is connected to an inlet wastewater pipe at one end and a  septic drain field  at the other. These pipe connections are generally made via a T pipe which allows liquid entry and egress without disturbing any crust on the surface. Today the design of the tank usually incorporates two chambers (each of which is equipped with a manhole cover) which are separated by means of a dividing wall which has openings located about midway between the floor and roof of the tank.   Wastewater enters the first chamber of the tank, allowing solids to settle and scum to float. The settled solids are anaerobically digested reducing the volume of solids. The liquid component flows through the dividing wall into the second chamber where further settlement takes place with the excess liquid then draining in a relatively clear condition from the outlet into the  leach field , also referred to as a drain field, or seepage field, depending upon locality.          Septic tank lift pump alarm system located in a house.       The remaining impurities decompose in the soil, and the water is eliminated through  percolation  into the  soil , and eventually taken up through the  root  system of  plants  or added to the  groundwater . A piping network, often constructed in a stone filled trench (see  weeping tile ), distributes the wastewater throughout the field with multiple drainage holes in the network. The size of the  leach field  is proportional to the volume of wastewater and inversely proportional to the porosity of the drainage field. The entire septic system can operate by gravity alone, or where topographic considerations require, with inclusion of a lift  pump .   An  Imhoff tank  is a two-stage septic system where the sludge is digested in a separate tank. This avoids mixing digested sludge with incoming sewage. Also, some septic tank designs have a second stage where the  effluent  from the anaerobic first stage is aerated before it drains into the seepage field.   Waste that is not decomposed by the anaerobic digestion eventually has to be removed from the septic tank, or else the septic tank fills up and undecomposed wastewater discharges directly to the drainage field. Not only is this bad for the environment, but if the sludge overflows the septic tank into the leach field, it may clog the leach field piping or the soil porosity itself, requiring expensive repairs.   How often the septic tank has to be emptied depends on the volume of the tank relative to the input of solids, the amount of indigestible solids and the ambient temperature (as anaerobic digestion occurs more efficiently at higher temperatures). The required frequency varies greatly depending on jurisdiction, usage, and system characteristics. Some health authorities require tanks to be emptied at prescribed intervals, while others leave it up to the determination of the inspector. Some systems require pumping every few years or sooner, while others may be able to go 10-20 years between pumpings. Contrary to what many believe, there is no ""rule of thumb"" for how often tanks should be emptied. An older system with an undersized tank that is being used by a large family will require much more frequent pumping than a new system used by only a few people. Anaerobic decomposition is rapidly re-started when the tank re-fills.   A properly designed and normally operating septic system is odour free and, besides periodic inspection and pumping of the septic tank, should last for decades with no maintenance.   A well designed and maintained concrete, fibreglass or plastic tank should last about 50 years. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Potential problems     Excessive dumping of cooking oils and grease can fill up the upper portion of the septic tank and can cause the inlet drains to block. Oils and grease are often difficult to degrade and can cause odor problems and difficulties with the periodic emptying.   Flushing non-biodegradable hygiene products such as sanitary towels and cotton buds will rapidly fill or clog a septic tank; these materials should not be disposed of in this way.   The use of  waste macerators or grinders  for disposal of waste food can cause a rapid overload of the system and early failure.   Certain chemicals may damage the working of a septic tank, especially pesticides, herbicides, materials with high concentrations of bleach or caustic soda (lye) or any other inorganic materials such as paints or solvents.   Roots from trees and shrubbery growing above the tank or the drain field may clog and or rupture them.   Playgrounds and storage buildings may cause damage to a tank and the drainage field. In addition, covering the drainage field with an impervious surface, such as a driveway or parking area, will seriously affect its efficiency and possibly damage the tank and absorption system.   Excessive water entering the system will overload it and cause it to fail. Checking for plumbing leaks and practising water conservation will help the system's operation.   Even well maintained septic tanks release  mucus -producing anaerobic gut bacteria to the drainage field. The mucus ""slime"" will slowly clog the soil pores surrounding the drain pipe and percolation can slow to the point where backups or surfacing effluent can occur. This slime is called biomat and such a failure is referred to as ""Biomat failure"" [ 3 ] .   If the system is damaged or malfunctions, contact your local health or environmental authority before attempting any repairs. Improper repair can result in costly mistakes and potential health hazards.   Septic tanks by themselves are ineffective at removing  nitrogen  compounds that can cause  algae blooms  in receiving waters; this can be remedied by using a nitrogen-reducing technology. [1]       [ edit ]   Environmental issues   Some pollutants, especially  sulfates , under the anaerobic conditions of septic tanks, are reduced to  hydrogen sulfide , a  pungent  and  toxic  gas. Likewise,  nitrates  and  organic nitrogen compounds  are reduced to  ammonia . Because of the anaerobic conditions,  fermentation  processes take place, which ultimately generate  carbon dioxide  and  methane .   The fermentation processes cause the contents of a septic tank to be anoxic with a low  redox  potential, which keeps  phosphate  in a soluble and thus mobilized form. Because phosphate can be the limiting nutrient for plant growth in many ecosystems, the discharge from a septic tank into the environment can trigger prolific plant growth including algal blooms which can also include blooms of potentially toxic  cyanobacteria .   Soil capacity to retain phosphorus is large compared with the load through a normal residential septic tank. An exception occurs when  septic drain fields  are located in sandy or coarser soils on property adjoining a water body. Because of limited particle surface area, these soils can become saturated with phosphate. Phosphate will progress beyond the treatment area, posing a threat of  eutrophication  to surface waters. [ 4 ]   In areas with high population density, groundwater pollution levels often exceed acceptable limits. Some small towns are facing the costs of building very expensive centralized wastewater treatment systems because of this problem, owing to the high cost of extended collection systems.   To slow development, building moratoriums and limits on the  subdivision  of property are often imposed. Ensuring existing septic tanks are functioning properly can also be helpful for a limited time, but becomes less effective as a primary remediation strategy as population density increases.   Trees in the vicinity of a concrete septic tank have the potential to penetrate the tank as the system ages and the concrete begins to develop cracks and small leaks. Tree roots can cause serious flow problems due to plugging and blockage of drain pipes, but the trees themselves tend to grow extremely vigorously due to the continuous influx of nutrients into the septic system.

SEPTIC TANK PUMPING SCHEDULE - A Guide to Septic Cleaning - How Often Do You Pump Out A Septic Tank?   Table I below lists the recommended septic tank pumping frequency  according to septic tank capacity and household size. The frequencies were calculated to provide a minimum of 24 hours of wastewater retention assuming 50 percent digestion of the retained solids.     In addition to our article on  HOW TO FIND A SEPTIC TANK , septic system maintenance and repair are discussed in a collection of detailed articles listed at  Septic Tank and Septic System Maintenance .    The removal of  septic waste  by cleaning the septic tank is a critical step in septic system care as it extends the life of the septic field. Even if you don't care   how septic systems work you need to know when to clean the septic tank by pumping out septic waste. Look up your tank size and number   of building occupants to see how often the septic tank should be cleaned.     Table I. Septic Tank Pumping Frequency in Years   .

(This data does not pertain to simple holding tanks which     retain all solid and liquid waste with no treatment no effluent disposal system.)     * These septic tank sizes are below the minimum size allowed  in Pennsylvania and other jurisdictions. Florida septic tank pumping rules and Ohio septic tank     cleaning rules may be more demanding.     Minimum septic tank sizes : Under current Pennsylvania law a 900 gallon septic tank is the minimum size that must be used for a home with     three bedrooms or less. If six people reside in a three-bedroom house, the tank should be pumped every 1.3 years.     If the same system serves a family of two, the tank would be ready for pumping every 5.2 years. Systems installed     before the current rules and regulations were implemented may need to be pumped more often, perhaps every year or less.     Garbage disposers  will increase the frequency of pumping. For example, if this same three bedroom house with six residents had a garbage disposal and was generally producing a higher volume of wastewater, the pumping frequency would be calculated as follows:     1.3 years - [(0.2) x 1.3 years] = 1.0 year. For more analysis of the effect of garbage disposers on septic systems see     Garbage Grinders or Garbage Disposes and Septic Tank Maintenance     Typical Septic Tank Pumping Costs : A typical fee to pump a septic tank is $200. to $300 to pump a septic tank up to 1000g in size, provided     that the tank pumping access port has been uncovered and is readily accessible. If the septic pumping contractor needs to find the septic tank     and then excavate the septic tank pumping access opening, expect to pay an additional $350. to $400. provided that no extraordinary measures     are needed. Prices vary somewhat by region. A part of the fee you're paying your septic pumping contractor is the cost to dispose of     the septage.     Onsite sewage disposal system holding tanks, where there is no septic field, will need to be pumped   more frequently based simply on the rate and volume of septic waste inflow.

clueweb09-enwp02-20-21547	"                     Septic tank          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search                       A septic tank before installation                      The same tank partially installed in the ground                      Septic tank and  septic drain field             A  septic tank , the key component of a  septic system , is a small scale  sewage treatment  system common in areas with no connection to main sewage pipes provided by private corporations or local governments. (Other components, typically mandated and/or restricted by local governments, optionally include pumps, alarms,  sand filters , and clarified liquid effluent disposal means such as a  septic drain field , ponds, or  peat moss  beds.) Septic systems are a type of On-Site Sewage Facility ( OSSF ). In  North America  approximately 25% of the population relies on septic tanks; this can include  suburbs  and small towns as well as  rural  areas. ( Indianapolis  is an example of a large city where much of the city's neighborhoods are still on separate septic systems) In Europe they are generally limited to rural areas only.   The term ""septic"" refers to the  anaerobic bacterial  environment that develops in the tank and which decomposes or mineralizes the waste discharged into the tank. Adding a supplemental bacterial agent to the tank may accelerate the digestion of solids in the tank. Septic tanks can be coupled with other  on-site wastewater treatment  units such as  biofilters  or aerobic systems involving artificial forced  aeration . [ 1 ]   Periodic  preventive maintenance  is required to remove the irreducible solids which settle and gradually fill the tank, reducing its efficiency. In most jurisdictions this maintenance is required by law, yet often not enforced. Those who ignore the requirement will eventually be faced with extremely costly repairs when solids escape the tank and destroy the clarified liquid effluent disposal means. A properly cared-for system, on the other hand, can last for decades and possibly a lifetime.

These pipe connections are generally made via a T pipe which allows liquid entry and egress without disturbing any crust on the surface. Today the design of the tank usually incorporates two chambers (each of which is equipped with a manhole cover) which are separated by means of a dividing wall which has openings located about midway between the floor and roof of the tank.   Wastewater enters the first chamber of the tank, allowing solids to settle and scum to float. The settled solids are anaerobically digested reducing the volume of solids. The liquid component flows through the dividing wall into the second chamber where further settlement takes place with the excess liquid then draining in a relatively clear condition from the outlet into the  leach field , also referred to as a drain field, or seepage field, depending upon locality.          Septic tank lift pump alarm system located in a house.       The remaining impurities decompose in the soil, and the water is eliminated through  percolation  into the  soil , and eventually taken up through the  root  system of  plants  or added to the  groundwater . A piping network, often constructed in a stone filled trench (see  weeping tile ), distributes the wastewater throughout the field with multiple drainage holes in the network. The size of the  leach field  is proportional to the volume of wastewater and inversely proportional to the porosity of the drainage field. The entire septic system can operate by gravity alone, or where topographic considerations require, with inclusion of a lift  pump .   An  Imhoff tank  is a two-stage septic system where the sludge is digested in a separate tank. This avoids mixing digested sludge with incoming sewage. Also, some septic tank designs have a second stage where the  effluent  from the anaerobic first stage is aerated before it drains into the seepage field.   Waste that is not decomposed by the anaerobic digestion eventually has to be removed from the septic tank, or else the septic tank fills up and undecomposed wastewater discharges directly to the drainage field. Not only is this bad for the environment, but if the sludge overflows the septic tank into the leach field, it may clog the leach field piping or the soil porosity itself, requiring expensive repairs.   How often the septic tank has to be emptied depends on the volume of the tank relative to the input of solids, the amount of indigestible solids and the ambient temperature (as anaerobic digestion occurs more efficiently at higher temperatures). The required frequency varies greatly depending on jurisdiction, usage, and system characteristics. Some health authorities require tanks to be emptied at prescribed intervals, while others leave it up to the determination of the inspector. Some systems require pumping every few years or sooner, while others may be able to go 10-20 years between pumpings. Contrary to what many believe, there is no ""rule of thumb"" for how often tanks should be emptied. An older system with an undersized tank that is being used by a large family will require much more frequent pumping than a new system used by only a few people. Anaerobic decomposition is rapidly re-started when the tank re-fills.   A properly designed and normally operating septic system is odour free and, besides periodic inspection and pumping of the septic tank, should last for decades with no maintenance.   A well designed and maintained concrete, fibreglass or plastic tank should last about 50 years. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Potential problems     Excessive dumping of cooking oils and grease can fill up the upper portion of the septic tank and can cause the inlet drains to block. Oils and grease are often difficult to degrade and can cause odor problems and difficulties with the periodic emptying.   Flushing non-biodegradable hygiene products such as sanitary towels and cotton buds will rapidly fill or clog a septic tank; these materials should not be disposed of in this way.   The use of  waste macerators or grinders  for disposal of waste food can cause a rapid overload of the system and early failure.   Certain chemicals may damage the working of a septic tank, especially pesticides, herbicides, materials with high concentrations of bleach or caustic soda (lye) or any other inorganic materials such as paints or solvents.   Roots from trees and shrubbery growing above the tank or the drain field may clog and or rupture them.   Playgrounds and storage buildings may cause damage to a tank and the drainage field. In addition, covering the drainage field with an impervious surface, such as a driveway or parking area, will seriously affect its efficiency and possibly damage the tank and absorption system.   Excessive water entering the system will overload it and cause it to fail. Checking for plumbing leaks and practising water conservation will help the system's operation.   Even well maintained septic tanks release  mucus -producing anaerobic gut bacteria to the drainage field. The mucus ""slime"" will slowly clog the soil pores surrounding the drain pipe and percolation can slow to the point where backups or surfacing effluent can occur. This slime is called biomat and such a failure is referred to as ""Biomat failure"" [ 3 ] .   If the system is damaged or malfunctions, contact your local health or environmental authority before attempting any repairs. Improper repair can result in costly mistakes and potential health hazards.   Septic tanks by themselves are ineffective at removing  nitrogen  compounds that can cause  algae blooms  in receiving waters; this can be remedied by using a nitrogen-reducing technology. [1]       [ edit ]   Environmental issues   Some pollutants, especially  sulfates , under the anaerobic conditions of septic tanks, are reduced to  hydrogen sulfide , a  pungent  and  toxic  gas. Likewise,  nitrates  and  organic nitrogen compounds  are reduced to  ammonia . Because of the anaerobic conditions,  fermentation  processes take place, which ultimately generate  carbon dioxide  and  methane .   The fermentation processes cause the contents of a septic tank to be anoxic with a low  redox  potential, which keeps  phosphate  in a soluble and thus mobilized form. Because phosphate can be the limiting nutrient for plant growth in many ecosystems, the discharge from a septic tank into the environment can trigger prolific plant growth including algal blooms which can also include blooms of potentially toxic  cyanobacteria .   Soil capacity to retain phosphorus is large compared with the load through a normal residential septic tank. An exception occurs when  septic drain fields  are located in sandy or coarser soils on property adjoining a water body. Because of limited particle surface area, these soils can become saturated with phosphate. Phosphate will progress beyond the treatment area, posing a threat of  eutrophication  to surface waters. [ 4 ]   In areas with high population density, groundwater pollution levels often exceed acceptable limits. Some small towns are facing the costs of building very expensive centralized wastewater treatment systems because of this problem, owing to the high cost of extended collection systems.   To slow development, building moratoriums and limits on the  subdivision  of property are often imposed. Ensuring existing septic tanks are functioning properly can also be helpful for a limited time, but becomes less effective as a primary remediation strategy as population density increases.   Trees in the vicinity of a concrete septic tank have the potential to penetrate the tank as the system ages and the concrete begins to develop cracks and small leaks. Tree roots can cause serious flow problems due to plugging and blockage of drain pipes, but the trees themselves tend to grow extremely vigorously due to the continuous influx of nutrients into the septic system.

SEPTIC INSPECTION WORK SHEETS - Septic System Inspection and Testing Worksheets   Here we provide a series of field worksheets  useful during the conduct of septic system inspections for investigations of the condition of a septic system using level 0, 1, and 2 septic inspections.   Worksheet for Septic Inspection Level 0 - Basic Information               A surprising amount of useful diagnostic information about the condition of a septic tank and drainfield can be developed by a thoughtful visual inspection of the property even before any steps to test the septic system have begun. The two photos above show a case in which an old home-made septic tank was located just a few feet from a public lake. You can see our septic test water pouring into the septic tank in the upper right part of the right hand photo. The jumble of stones visible just inside the septic ""tank"" indicate that this is a home-made system, perhaps simply a cesspool. With the nearby stream and lake just a few feet away, this system is unlikely to be acceptable by modern standards of sanitation and building code. Below we've printed our field data collection worksheets used for septic system inspection.

If a septic mound system or raised bed septic system is installed, a pump may be required to move effluent from a pumping chamber up to the mound treatment area. The presence of a septic mound will be quite obvious but the presence or absence of a pump serving the mound may be less apparent. Look for control boxes, pumping chamber access cover, and of course request whatever information a prior owner may be able to provide - but dont' rely on that data to be complete.

EXPLANATION: At the time of our inspection the sewage disposal system appeared to be working normally and adequately. There was no evidence of stopped main drains, no unusual septic odors. [If a loading/dye test was NOT performed:] By your instruction, we did not perform a system loading and dye test. Important additional information about system condition is available from this and other levels of septic inspection. [There was/was not evidence of recent excavation or repair - which suggests that additional questions to owner or investigation are in order.] [If a loading/dye test was performed:] Report details of dye test procedures (see below), and results.  SEPTIC SYSTEM LOADING AND DYE TEST ON-SITE DETAILS: WATER run at:______________________ for __________ minutes prior to introducing tracer dye.

The first photo shows water running across rock near the reported septic tank location before we began our septic loading test. The second or right-hand photo shows the increase in water running across this rock shortly after we began testing this septic system.

The photo at above left shows a concrete septic tank which has been opened at its inlet baffle to show the baffle top. Sewage on the baffle top tells us that this tank has been subjected to flooding, either because its outlet or absorption field are clogged, or because it has been flooded by excessive sudden inpput (or a blocked baffle). We traced this particular case to ground water entering and flooding the tank during heavy rain - a problem which was corrected quite easily and at low cost.     The second photograph above shows a home made septic tank which was in total  failure, discovered 24 hours after new owners moved into this home. An improper ""septic test"" had been performed by their home  inspector. Even a minimal test, had the inspector run water into the proper drain, would have been likely to discover this  condition as the tank was totally impacted with solid waste and roots. The buyers never had a  chance  to discover this problem  since no proper septic test was performed.    SEPTIC  TANK INSPECTION: (Tank is located and main access is opened if accessible.)

Such as the: American Standard Cadet; Crane Plumbing Economiser; Eljer AquaSaver; Gerber Ultra Flush; Kohler Pressure Lite; Mansfield Quantum; and the Universal-Rundle Corp. Powerflush.             WARNING:  When servicing or replacing components to the FLUSHMATE Flushometer Tank System, make certain that the water supply is turned OFF and the toilet is then flushed to relieve pressure in the vessel. NEVER use lubricants on any of the components unless otherwise noted in instructions.   NEVER use corrosive chemicals or household cleaners on FLUSHMATE products.                            CONDITION:  Water runs on and will not shut off.          A newly installed toilet that does not shut off may have an inadequate or low  water supply flow rate into the FLUSHMATE Vessel.  (NOTE:  The recommended static pressure range by code is 20 P.S.I. to 80 P.S.I.).  Check the water supply pressure as follows:      a)  Turn off the water supply and disconnect the line under the tank.     b)  Place the end of the supply tube into a bucket.     c)   Open the stop completely for 30 seconds.  Measure the amount of water in the bucket (it should be more than a gallon).  When sufficient supply pressure has been verified and the toilet continues to run, the following steps may be required:          Step 1       Make sure supply stop is fully open.              Step 2        Check the Supply Shank for any obstruction what would restrict the supply.                Step 3          Check the Actuator adjustment (see Installation Procedure).                Step 4            Check the Flush Valve Cartridge Assembly for proper installation.  Proceed as follows:     a)     Turn off the water supply and flush the toilet.    b)   Remove the Flush Valve Cartridge Assembly using pliers' handles as shown in fig. 2.   NOTE:  You may be required to disconnect the trip lever to remove the Flush Valve Cartridge Assembly.            Step 5         Reinstall the Flush Valve Cartridge Assembly.      NOTE:  First rotate the Cartridge Assembly counter-clockwise approx. 2 full turns (to avoid cross-threading), then screw into place (rotate clockwise) until Cartridge Assembly seats against the discaharge adapter at the bottom of the Tank.  This normally occurs when 2 to 3 Flush Valve Cartridge threads are still showing at the top of the black Vesel;   Do Not overtighten.  Keep the Tank Cover off and turn on the water supply.  Allow the Tank to refill ... total cycle should be 30 to 60 seconds.            Step 6        If the Tank continues to run-on, push down lightly on the Flush Valve Cartridge Stem.  If the water stops running, it is an indication that the Flush Vavle Cartridge still needs further adjustment downward.  If the water still continues to run-on after downward adjustment is made, then the Flush Valve Cartridge requires an upward adjustment.    NOTE:   Adjust the Flush Valve Cartridge Assembly in quarter to half turn increments until the water stops running.  Always turn the water supply off and restart the cycle after each adjustment to insure that proper adjustment has been made.          Step 7        If replacement of the Flush Valve Cartridge is necessary, follow the instructions in Step 5 above.         CONDITION:   Weak or Sluggish Flush               Step 1        Check the water pressure (20psi - 80psi recommended).  If OK, then check the Flush System by removing the Tank Cover and tripping the Actuator.  While the unit is flushing, gently raise the Actuator.  Water should flow freely and wash away any debris in the supply line and Vessel.             Step 2       Test the Air Inducer by tripping the Actuator.  At the end of the flush cycle, when the Vessel starts to refill, count the number os seconds between the Actuator dropping and the reseating of the Air Inducer.  Proper Air Refill requires a minimum of 3 seconds.   NOTE:   It is normal for the Air Inducer to expel a few drops of water with each flush.            To Clean Air Inducer (Figures 3 & 4)                            a)  Turn off the water supply and trip the Actuator.   b)  Unscrew the Air Inducer Cap and clean thoroughly removing any obstructions.  Reassemble.   c)  Turn on water supply.  Wait for the Vessel to refill (45 to 60 seconds).   Repeat ""Step 2) -  Test the Air Inducer"" above.  If the Air Inducer does not function properly, replace the Upper Supply Assembly.             Step 3        To check the Flush Valve Cartridge for leaks, turn the water supply off and drain the Vessel by tripping the Actuator and holding it down until completely drained.  Next, pour a cup of water onto the Cartridge Housing area as shown in Fig. 5.  Turn on the Water supply.  If a leakage is detected (a steady flow of bubbles from the center of the Cartridge Area) the Cartridge should be replaced.             Step 4       Turn the water off and relieve the Vessel pressure by flushing the Toilet.  Remove the supply line located outside the Tank at the bottom left-hand side.  Check for blockages inside the Supply Shank.                    Step 5       Check the main Drain Vent.  A stopped-up bowl, poor drain ventilation or a blocked main will create excessive back pressure, thereby creating a slow flush cycle.  If the drain and drain vent are clear, and the flush has not been improved, replace the Lower Supply Assembly.  Refer to Section: Replacement Procedure for Lower Supply (below).       CONDITION:  No Flush        Step 1          Check the water pressure (20 psi to 80 psi).              Step 2        Review all of Step 3 and 4 covered in ""Weak or Sluggish Flush"" Condition.            Step 3        Check for water in the System by pushing in on the Air Inducer Poppet.  If water comes out, go to Step 4 (next).  If no water comes out, then replace the Pressure Regulator Valve.  Refer to Section: Replacement Procedure or Lower Supply.           Step 4            Replace the Flush Valve Cartridge.  NEVER use lubricant on the ""O""-Ring (Arrow in figure 6)        CONDITION:  Relief  Valve Discharging         This is a sign that the Pressure Regulator Valve, located in the Lower Supply Group (figure 7), is not working properly and should be replaced.  Follow the procedure outlined below:           Steps 1-8            1.  Turn the water supply OFF.   2.  Flush the fixture to relieve pressure in the Vessel.   3.  Disconnect the water supply from the Shank.   4.  Unscrew the plastic locknut that holds the Shank to the bottom of the China Tank.   5.  Carefully pull the entire Lower Supply up and out of the Tank.    NOTE:  DO NOT FORCE  or place a bending load on the Upper Supply.   6.  Cut the Hose just above the Barbed Fitting on the Lower Supply.  Discard old Lower Supply.   7.  Insert new Lower Supply into Hose and secure with new Hose Clamp using pliers.   8.  Carefully replace the entire Supply Group Assembly into the Tank and tighten plastic locknut.

clueweb09-en0001-99-18624	"  Septic Systems and Their Maintenance       Thomas H. Miller         Proper design, installation, and maintenance of your septic system will maximize your system's life. It will prevent failures that can be unsightly, foul-smelling, and threatening to your family's health. Good maintenance reduces the risk of contaminating your well water, and may save you from costly repairs or system replacement.     Septic tank inspection may be required by lenders when you sell or refinance your home. The repair of a failing system is usually a cost to the seller. So, ignoring your septic system will not save money in the long term!       How Your System Works     A septic system has two major components: a septic tank and a drainfield.    Septic Tank : Waste water flows from the house to the septic tank. The tank is designed to retain waste water and allow heavy solids to settle to the bottom. These solids are partially decomposed by bacteria to form  sludge . Grease and light particles float, forming a layer of  scum  on top of the waste water. Baffles installed at the inlet and outlet of the tank to help prevent scum and solids from escaping. [See Figure 1.] Newer septic tanks can have a partial concrete dividing wall in the center, thus making two compartments. This helps ensure the sludge does not get forced out of the baffle into the drainfield. Newer tanks can also have two manhole covers, one above each baffle. [See Figure 1a.]                                                                                                              Newer style  2-compartment  septic tanks.                                                             Drainfield (Trench) : A solid pipe leads from the septic tank to a distribution box where the waste water is channeled into one or more perforated pipes set in trenches of gravel. Here the water slowly infiltrates (seeps) into the underlying soil. Dissolved wastes and bacteria in the water are trapped or adsorbed to soil particles or decomposed by microorganisms. This process removes disease-causing organisms, organic matter, and most nutrients (except nitrogen and some salts). The purified wastewater then either moves to the ground water or evaporates from the soil. Trench systems are the most common type of system used in new home construction.                                         An alternative to the common drain field is the Seepage Pit (Dry Well). In this type, liquid flows to a pre-cast tank with sidewall holes, surrounded by gravel. (Older versions usually consist of a pit with open-jointed brick or stone walls.) Liquid seeps through the holes or joints to the surrounding soil.                                                Another alternative is the Sand Mound System: These systems are used in areas where the site is not suitable for traditional septic systems. For instance, the soil may have too much clay to allow the water to seep through at the proper rate, or the water table may be too close to the ground surface. In these systems, the waste water flows from the septic tank to a storage tank. The liquid is then pumped from the tank to perforated plastic pipes buried in a mound of sand built on the original soil surface. This system provides a layer of suitable soil thick enough to ensure adequate time and distance for proper treatment of the waste water. Vegetation growing on the mound helps to evaporate some of the liquid. This is particularly important in areas with shallow water tables.                        Possible Signs of Trouble      The septic tank has not been pumped out in the past five years. Even if the system appears to be working well, sludge may have built up to the point where waste water is released without sufficient time in the tank for treatment and settling of particles. This situation may result in pollution of groundwater or cause eventual clogging of the drainfield.    A wet area or standing water occurs above the drainfield. This situation can develop when sludge particles clog the drainfield, when tree roots or broken pipes keep the waste water from dispersing through the entire drainfield, or when water use in the house regularly exceeds the design capacity of the system. When these conditions occur, waste water does not move through the soil as it should, and instead rises to the surface creating a serious health risk and odor problems.      Toilets run slowly or backup: in the worst cases, the basement is flooded with sewage. This can be the result of plugged sewer lines to the tank, a plugged inlet or outlet pipe, a full septic tank, or a failed drainfield.      Septic odors occur in the house, above the tank and drainfield, or escape from the vent pipe. If the system is operating properly, there should be no odors. If there are odors, it can be an early warning sign that the system is failing.         Septic System Location     Locating the components of your system can be difficult. Note where your drain pipe leaves the house; this will point you in the direction of the septic tank. A search in this area may reveal the septic tank inspection ports and shallow depressions marking the trenches. Unfortunately, the tank is usually unmarked. If you can not find any signs of your system, the local Health Department might have your building records on file.  [ Maryland County Health Departments numbers and addresses .]  (In winter months, the tile lines and septic tank are usually the last place frost forms, and the first place snow melts in your yard.) Once you locate an unmarked tank, place a marker in the ground above the inspection ports and clean out manhole cover. Or, measure their exact distances from at least two reference points (such as a tree and the corner of the house) so you can easily find them again.          Maintenance Tips     INSIDE      Conserve water. Fix leaks and drips. If you replace old fixtures, install new ""low flow"" types.    Do not overload the system -- this is the primary cause of system failures. Early morning and bedtime are peak water use times in the bathroom. Run dishwashers and washing machines at other times of the day. Don't do all the family laundry in one day.      Do not use a garbage disposal or dump coffee grounds in the sink. Increasing the load of solids into the tank decreases the capacity and shortens the interval between pumpings.      Do not pour fats and oils down the drain. They can build up and clog the septic tank pipes.      Put paper towels, tissue, cigarette butts, disposable diapers, sanitary napkins, tampons and other material in a trash can, not the toilet.      You do NOT need to add any commercial products or yeast to your system.  Additives do not improve how well your system works. There are always plenty of natural bacteria available to do the job. (They come from YOUR digestive system.) In fact, additives can damage your system by breaking up the sludge and scum layers, causing them to flush out of the tank and clog the infiltration bed. Additives that say ""Never worry about pumping your septic tank again"" are the worst!         Use normal amounts of detergents, bleaches, drain cleaners, household cleaners and other products. Avoid dumping solvents like dry cleaning fluid, pesticides, photographic chemicals, paint thinner, or auto products down the drain.     OUTSIDE    Direct down spouts and runoff away from the septic field to avoid saturating the area with excess water.    Dense grass cover and other shallow rooted plants are beneficial over a septic field. However, do not plant trees because large plant roots can clog or break the pipes.      Avoid compacting the soil over the infiltration area. Do not drive or park vehicles over the area and don't build a shed or driveway in this area. These activities can also crack pipes or cause the distribution box to settle unevenly, meaning that effluent will only flow into part of the drain field.      Tanks need to be pumped every two to five years, depending on use. If the tank gets too full, particles of scum or sludge will flush out of the tank. This material will clog the drain tiles and cause the septic system to fail.      Hire a licensed professional (listed in the phone book under ""septic tank cleaners"") to pump the waste out of your tank. The tank should be pumped out through the manhole, not the smaller inspection ports. The tank should be cleaned completely, leaving nothing in the tank. Make sure the baffles are inspected and that the tank is checked for leaks.           FAQ      I get a lot of similar questions concerning odors both inside and outside the house.

clueweb09-enwp03-37-18586	"                     Weatherstripping          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Weather Strip )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search          Weatherstripping  is the process of sealing openings such as doors, windows, and trunks from the elements. The goal of weatherstripping is to prevent rain and water from entering by either blocking it outright or by blocking most of it and returning or rerouting it. A secondary goal of weatherstripping is to keep interior air in, thus saving energy with heating and air conditioning.   The materials used in weatherstripping are thresholds, a piece of material, either a sweep or a  J-hook , to match the door to the threshold, and the actual weathstripping itself.   Every exterior door, or door to an uninsulated room such as an attic, must be weatherstripped as required by  code enforcement  in various states of U.S. Doors can usually be divided into private homes and commercial properties. Some of these doors receive custom weatherstripping at the factory.   Weatherstripping is needed on on all openings between interior and exterior locations. Automobiles have large amounts of weatherstripping. Consider a standard 4 door vehicle: the doors may require 20 feet or more per door depending on the size of the opening. Windows will require upwards of 10 feet. Trunks require large amounts. Automotive weatherstipping has added difficulties that must be considered in the engineering of the parts. For example, the weatherstrip must function equally at keeping rain out when the vehicle is parked as when it is screaming down the autobahn. Automotive weatherstripping must endure extreme temperatures (hot and cold); be resistant to automotive liquids such as oil, gasoline, and particularly windshield washerfluid; and must resist years of full sun exposure. Automobile designers wish to have design continuity: all weatherseals should appear the same. This is a problem as they will likely be manufactured of different materials by different manufacturers. Likely the most significant issue is that of noise. After paint quality, interior noise is the second most important factor in car quality as perceived by the consumer. When automobiles go over bumps the car flexs and vibrates causing relative motions between the relatively fixed body and movable parts like doors, windows, and sunroofs. This movement could allow water in the vehicle so the weatherstrip must compensate by filling the gap. What is worse, this relative movement can cause noises such as squeaks, rattles, and itches to be heard within the vehicle. Many of these issues can be alleviated if the weatherstrip manufacturer coats the weatherstrip with specialty coatings. These coatings bond to the weatherstrip, provide chemical and UV resistance, decrease the coefficient of friction reducing the force required to open or close doors, and reduce or eliminate noise associated with weatherstripping. Not all vehicles have coated weatherstripping which means the weatherstripping is much more likely to cause the above mentioned issues along with others such as premature failure of the paint causing rusting. This is a very surprising situation given that the cost of the coating is less than 1 to 3 dollars per vehicle whereas the rubber and steel is tens of dollars (an entire car set of weatherstripping may be worth 100 to 300 dollars in the total cost of the vehicle which includes all labour and costs of the manufacturing equipement).   Automotive weatherstripping is commonly made of EPDM, TPE, TPO. Sunroof weatherstripping can also be made of silicone due to the extreme heat that parts on automobile roofs commonly encounter. Coatings for weatherstripping must adhere to all of these weatherstrip materials. Such coatings are commonly available (silicone is very difficult to adhere to, however at least one coating is commercially available for this purpose), however, like other paints and coatings, a large variety coatings are available and these have a large variety of coating performances. Poorly performing weatherstripping should be reported to the car dealership if the vehicle is under warranty as fixes may be known.     [ edit ]   Custom Weatherstripping   Custom weatherstripping, contrary to pre-weatherstripped units, require much more time and is considered to be a specialized skill.   Weatherstrippers install a threshold, cut the door and install a sweep or J-hook to the bottom of the door, and nail spring-steel bronze into the door jamb to seal the gap.     [ edit ]   Pre-Weatherstripped doors   Pre-weatherstripped doors for private homes are usually made of fiberglass or a similar material and are shipped from the factory weatherstripped, hence the pre-weatherstripped. The doors have a kerf in the door stop so that a foam, rubber, or vinyl strip can be placed inside for the door to rest against when closed. These doors also have the threshold - usually a molded piece of plastic - nailed to the frame in the factory. These units are not difficult to install and require very little skill for a trim carpenter where a weather-stripper is required for custom weatherstripping.

[ citation needed ]  In terms of  revenue  generated, it is one of the most valuable products of the  chemical industry . Around the world, over 50% of PVC manufactured is used in construction. As a building material, PVC is cheap, durable, and easy to assemble. The PVC world market grew with an average rate of approximately 5% in the last years and will probably reach a volume of 40 million tons by the year 2016.   It can be made softer and more flexible by the addition of  plasticizers , the most widely-used being  phthalates . In this form, it is used in  clothing  and  upholstery , and to make flexible  hoses  and tubing,  flooring , to roofing membranes, and electrical cable insulation. It is also commonly used in figurines and in inflatable products such as  waterbeds ,  pool  toys or jump houses.

Since about 57% of its mass is  chlorine , creating a given mass of PVC requires less  petroleum  than many other polymers. [ citation needed ]         By far the most widely used production process is suspension polymerization. In this process, VCM and water are introduced into the polymerization reactor and a polymerization initiator, along with other chemical additives, are added to initiate the polymerization reaction. The contents of the reaction vessel are continually mixed to maintain the suspension and ensure a uniform particle size of the PVC resin. The reaction is  exothermic , and thus requires a cooling mechanism to maintain the reactor contents at the appropriate temperature. As the volumes also contract during the reaction (PVC is denser than VCM), water is continually added to the mixture to maintain the suspension.   Once the reaction has run its course, the resulting PVC slurry is degassed and stripped to remove excess VCM (which is recycled into the next batch) then passed though a centrifuge to remove most of the excess water. The slurry is then dried further in a hot air bed and the resulting powder sieved before storage or pelletization. In normal operations, the resulting PVC has a VCM content of less than 1  part per million .   Other production processes, such as micro-suspension polymerization and emulsion polymerization, produce PVC with smaller particle sizes (10m vs 120-150m for suspension PVC) with slightly different properties and with somewhat different sets of applications.     [ edit ]   History   Polyvinyl chloride was accidentally discovered on at least two different occasions in the 19th century, first in 1835 by  Henri Victor Regnault  and in 1872 by  Eugen Baumann . On both occasions, the  polymer  appeared as a white solid inside flasks of  vinyl chloride  that had been left exposed to sunlight. In the early 20th century, the Russian chemist  Ivan Ostromislensky  and  Fritz Klatte  of the German chemical company  Griesheim-Elektron  both attempted to use PVC (polyvinyl chloride) in commercial products, but difficulties in processing the rigid, sometimes brittle polymer blocked their efforts. In 1926,  Waldo Semon  and the  B.F. Goodrich  Company developed a method to  plasticize  PVC by blending it with various additives. The result was a more flexible and more easily-processed material that soon achieved widespread commercial use.     [ edit ]   Applications   PVC's intrinsic properties make it suitable for a wide variety of applications. It is biologically and chemically resistant, making it the plastic of choice for most household sewerage pipes and other pipe applications where corrosion would limit the use of metal.   With the addition of impact modifiers and stabilizers, it becomes a popular material for window and door frames. By adding plasticizers, it can become flexible enough to be used in cabling applications as a wire insulator.     [ edit ]   Clothing   PVC has become widely used in clothing either create a leather like material or at times simply for the effect of PVC. PVC clothing is common in Goth, Punk and other alternative fashions as well as in Fetish wear. PVC is cheaper than rubber, leather or latex and so it is more widely available and worn.   PVC fabric has a sheen to it and is waterproof. It is commonly used in coats, jackets, aprons and bags because of this.     [ edit ]   Electric wires   PVC is commonly used as the insulation on electric wires; the plastic used for this purpose needs to be  plasticized .   In a fire, PVC-coated wires can form  HCl  fumes; the chlorine serves to scavenge  free radicals  and is the source of the material's  fire retardance . While HCl fumes can also pose a health hazard in their own right, HCl dissolves in moisture and breaks down onto surfaces, particularly in areas where the air is cool enough to breathe, and is not available for inhalation. [ 3 ]  Frequently in applications where smoke is a major hazard (notably in tunnels) PVC-free  LSOH  (low-smoke, zero- halogen ) cable insulation is preferred.     [ edit ]   Pipes          PVC  pipes  in use with  intumescent   firestops  at Nortown Casitas,  North York, Ontario .       Polyvinyl chloride is also widely used for producing some forms of pipes. In the water distribution market it accounts for 66 percent of the market in the US, and in sanitary sewer pipe applications, it accounts for 75 percent. [ 4 ]  Its light weight, high strength, and low reactivity make it particularly well-suited to this purpose. In addition, PVC pipes can be fused together using various solvent cements, creating permanent joints that are virtually impervious to leakage. Despite PVC's many advantages, in cases where very high strength or ease of disassembly is necessary, metal pipes are still preferred.   In February 2007, the California Building Standards Code was updated to approve the use of  chlorinated polyvinyl chloride  (CPVC) pipe for use in residential water supply piping systems. CPVC has been a nationally-accepted material in the US since 1982; however, California has only permitted its use on a limited basis since 2001. The Department of Housing and Community Development prepared and certified an Environmental Impact Report resulting in a recommendation that the Commission adopt and approve the use of CPVC. The Commission's vote was unanimous and CPVC has been placed in the 2007 California Plumbing Code. [ 5 ]   In the United States and Canada, PVC pipes account for the largest majority of pipe materials used in buried municipal applications for drinking water distribution and wastewater mains. A detailed State-of-the-Art review of PVC pipes in North America can be found in an article titled Thermoplastics at Work: A Comprehensive Review of Municipal PVC Piping Products. [ 6 ]     [ edit ]   Portable Electronic Accessories   PVC is finding increased use as a composite for the production of accessories or housings for portable electronics. Through a fusing process, it can adopt cleaning properties possessed by materials such as wool or cotton which can absorb dust particles and bacteria. Its inherent ability to absorb particles from the LCD screen and its form fitting characteristics make it effective. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Signs   In flat sheet form, polyvinyl chloride is formed in a variety of thicknesses and colors. As flat sheets, PVC is often expanded to create voids in the interior of the material, providing additional thickness without additional weight and cost. Sheets are cut using saw and rotary cutting equipment. Plasticized PVC is also used to produce thin, colored, or clear, adhesive-backed films referred to simply as vinyl. These films are typically cut on a computer-controlled  plotter  or printed in a  wide-format printer . These sheets and films are used to produce a wide variety of  commercial signage  products and markings on vehicles.     [ edit ]   Unplasticized polyvinyl chloride (uPVC)          Modern "" Tudorbethan "" house with uPVC gutters and downpipes, fascia, decorative imitation "" half-timbering "", windows, and doors       uPVC or Rigid PVC is often used in the building industry as a low-maintenance material, particularly in the  UK , and in the  United States  where it is known as vinyl, or  vinyl siding . [ 7 ] [ 8 ]  The material comes in a range of colors and finishes, including a photo-effect wood finish, and is used as a substitute for painted wood, mostly for  window frames  and  sills  when installing  double glazing  in new buildings, or to replace older single glazed windows. It has many other uses including  fascia , and  siding  or  weatherboarding . The same material has almost entirely replaced the use of  cast iron  for  plumbing  and  drainage , being used for waste pipes, drainpipes,  gutters  and downpipes. [ 9 ]   Due to  environmental concerns  use of PVC is discouraged by some local authorities in countries such as  Germany  and  The Netherlands . [ 10 ] [ 11 ]  This concerns both flexible PVC and rigid uPVC as not only the plasticizers in PVC are seen as a problem but also the emissions from manufacturing and disposal. The use of modern impact modifiers offer great stability. The issues of migration and brittleness of the PVC compound are overcome. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Health and safety     [ edit ]   Phthalate plasticizers   Many vinyl products contain additional chemicals to change the chemical consistency of the product. Some of these additional chemicals called additives can leach out of vinyl products.  Plasticizers  that must be added to make PVC flexible have been an additive of particular concern.   Because soft PVC toys have been made for babies for years, there are concerns that these additives leach out of soft toys into the mouths of the children chewing on them. Additionally, adult  sex toys  have been demonstrated to contain high concentrations of the additives. [ 12 ]  In January 2006, the European Union placed a ban on six types of phthalate softeners, including DEHP ( diethylhexyl phthalate ), used in toys. [ 13 ]  In the U.S. most companies have voluntarily stopped manufacturing PVC toys with DEHP and in 2003 the US Consumer Product Safety Commission ( CPSC ) denied a petition for a ban on PVC toys made with an alternative plasticizer, DINP ( diisononyl phthalate ). [ 14 ]  In April 2006, the  European Chemicals Bureau  of the  European Commission  published an assessment of DINP which found risk ""unlikely"" for children and newborns. [ 15 ]   Vinyl  IV  bags used in neo-natal  intensive care  units have also been shown to leach DEHP. In a draft guidance paper published in September 2002, the US FDA recognizes that many medical devices with PVC containing DEHP are not used in ways that result in significant human exposure to the chemical. [1]  However, FDA is suggesting that manufacturers consider eliminating the use of DEHP in certain devices that can result in high aggregate exposures for sensitive patient populations such as neonates.   Other vinyl products, including car interiors, shower curtains, flooring, initially release chemical gases into the  air . Some studies indicate that this  outgassing  of additives may contribute to health complications, and have resulted in a call for banning the use of DEHP on shower curtains, among other uses. [ 16 ]  The Japanese car companies  Toyota ,  Nissan , and  Honda  have eliminated PVC in their car interiors starting in 2007.   In 2004, a joint Swedish-Danish research team found a statistical association between allergies in children and indoor air levels of DEHP and BBzP ( butyl benzyl phthalate ), which is used in vinyl flooring. [ 17 ]  In December 2006, the European Chemicals Bureau of the European Commission released a final draft risk assessment of BBzP which found ""no concern"" for consumer exposure including exposure to children. [ 18 ]   In November 2005, one of the largest hospital networks in the U.S.,  Catholic Healthcare West , signed a contract with  B.Braun  for vinyl-free  intravenous  bags and tubing. [ 19 ]  According to the  Center for Health, Environment & Justice  in  Falls Church, VA , which helps to coordinate a ""precautionary"" ""  PVC Campaign "", several major corporations including  Microsoft ,  Wal-Mart , and  Kaiser Permanente   announced efforts to eliminate PVC  from products and packaging in 2005. Even Target is reducing its sale of items with PVC. ( http://besafenet.com/pvc/newsreleases/target_to_reduce_use.htm )   The FDA Paper titled ""Safety Assessment of Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP)Released from PVC Medical Devices"" states that [3.2.1.3] Critically ill or injured patients may be at increased risk of developing adverse health effects from DEHP, not only by virtue of increased exposure, relative to the general population, but also because of the physiological and pharmacodynamic changes that occur in these patients, compared to healthy individuals. [ 20 ]   In 2008, The European Union's Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) reviewed the safety of DEHP in medical devices.  The SCENIHR report  states that certain medical procedures used in high risk patients result in a significant exposure to DEHP and concludes there is still a reason for having some concerns about the exposure of prematurely born male babies to medical devices containing DEHP. The Committee said there are some alternative plasticisers available for which there is sufficient toxicological data to indicate a lower hazard compared to DEHP but added that the functionality of these plasticisers should be assessed before they can be used as an alternative for DEHP in PVC medical devices.     [ edit ]   Vinyl chloride monomer   In the early 1970s, Dr. John Creech and Dr. Maurice Johnson were the first to clearly link and recognize the carcinogenicity of  vinyl chloride  monomer to humans when workers in the polyvinyl chloride polymerization section of a B.F. Goodrich plant near Louisville, Kentucky, were diagnosed with liver  angiosarcoma  also known as  hemangiosarcoma , a rare disease. [ 21 ]  Since that time, studies of PVC workers in Australia, Italy, Germany, and the UK have all associated certain types of occupational cancers with exposure to vinyl chloride. The link between angiosarcoma of the liver and long-term exposure to vinyl chloride is the only one that has been confirmed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. All the cases of angiosarcoma developed from exposure to vinyl chloride monomer, were in workers who were exposed to very high VCM levels, routinely, for many years. These workers cleaned accretions in reactors, a practice that has now been replaced by automated high pressure water jets.   A 1997 U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report concluded that the development and acceptance by the PVC industry of a closed loop polymerization process in the late 1970s ""almost completely eliminated worker exposures"" and that ""new cases of hepatic angiosarcoma in vinyl chloride polymerization workers have been virtually eliminated."" [ 22 ]   According to the EPA, ""vinyl chloride emissions from polyvinyl chloride (PVC),  ethylene dichloride  (EDC), and  vinyl chloride  monomer (VCM) plants cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to result in an increase in mortality or an increase in serious irreversible, or incapacitating reversible illness. Vinyl chloride is a known human carcinogen that causes a rare cancer of the liver."" [ 23 ]  EPA's 2001 updated Toxicological Profile and Summary Health Assessment for VCM in its Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) database lowers EPA's previous risk factor estimate by a factor of 20 and concludes that ""because of the consistent evidence for liver cancer in all the studies...and the weaker association for other sites, it is concluded that the liver is the most sensitive site, and protection against liver cancer will protect against possible  cancer induction  in other tissues."" [ 24 ]   A 1998 front-page series in the  Houston Chronicle  claimed the vinyl industry has manipulated vinyl chloride studies to avoid liability for worker exposure and to hide extensive and severe chemical spills into local communities. [ 25 ]  Retesting of community residents in 2001 by the U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) found dioxin levels similar to those in a comparison community in Louisiana and to the U.S. population. [ 26 ]  Cancer rates in the community were similar to Louisiana and US averages. [ 27 ]     [ edit ]   Dioxins   The environmentalist group  Greenpeace  has advocated the global phase-out of PVC because they claim  dioxin  is produced as a byproduct of  vinyl chloride  manufacture and from incineration of waste PVC in domestic garbage. The European Industry, however, asserts [ citation needed ]  that it has improved production processes to minimize dioxin emissions.   Also, scientific tests wherein municipal refuse containing several known concentrations of PVC was burned in a commercial-scale incinerator showed no relationship between the PVC content of the waste and dioxin emissions. [ 28 ]   [ 29 ]   PVC produces HCl upon combustion almost quantitatively related to its chlorine content. Extensive studies in Europe indicate that the chlorine found in emitted dioxins is not derived from HCl in the flue gases. Instead, most dioxins arise in the condensed solid phase by the reaction of inorganic chlorides with graphitic structures in char-containing ash particles. Copper acts as a catalyst for these reactions. [ 30 ]   Dioxins are a global health threat because they persist in the environment and can travel long distances. At very low levels, near those to which the general population is exposed, dioxins have been linked [ citation needed ]  to immune system suppression, reproductive disorders, a variety of cancers, and  endometriosis . According to a 1994 report by the British firm, ICI Chemicals & Polymers Ltd., ""It has been known since the publication of a paper in 1989 that these oxychlorination reactions [used to make vinyl chloride and some chlorinated solvents] generate polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs) and dibenzofurans (PCDFs). The reactions include all of the ingredients and conditions necessary to form PCDD/PCDFs.... It is difficult to see how any of these conditions could be modified so as to prevent PCDD/PCDF formation without seriously impairing the reaction for which the process is designed."" In other words, dioxins are an undesirable byproduct of producing vinyl chloride and eliminating the production of dioxins while maintaining the oxychlorination reaction may be difficult. Dioxins created by vinyl chloride production are released by on-site incinerators, flares, boilers, wastewater treatment systems and even in trace quantities in vinyl resins. [ 31 ]  The US EPA estimate of dioxin releases from the PVC industry was 13 grams TEQ in 1995, or less than 0.5% of the total dioxin emissions in the US; by 2002, PVC industry dioxin emissions had been further reduced by 23%. [ 32 ]   The largest well-quantified source of dioxin in the US EPA inventory of dioxin sources is barrel burning of household waste. [ 33 ]  Studies of household waste burning indicate consistent increases in dioxin generation with increasing PVC concentrations. [ 34 ]  According to the EPA dioxin inventory,  landfill fires  are likely to represent an even larger source of dioxin to the environment. A survey of international studies consistently identifies high dioxin concentrations in areas affected by open waste burning and a study that looked at the homologue pattern found the sample with the highest dioxin concentration was ""typical for the pyrolysis of PVC"". Other EU studies indicate that PVC likely ""accounts for the overwhelming majority of chlorine that is available for dioxin formation during landfill fires."" [ 35 ]   The next largest sources of dioxin in the EPA inventory are medical and municipal waste incinerators. [ 36 ]  Studies have shown a clear correlation between dioxin formation and chloride content and indicate that PVC is a significant contributor to the formation of both dioxin and PCB in incinerators. [ 37 ]   In February 2007, the Technical and Scientific Advisory Committee of the US Green Building Council (USGBC) released its report on a PVC avoidance related materials credit for the LEED Green Building Rating system. The report concludes that ""no single material shows up as the best across all the human health and environmental impact categories, nor as the worst"" but that the ""risk of dioxin emissions puts PVC consistently among the worst materials for human health impacts.""  [ 38 ]     [ edit ]   Bans   The State of California is currently considering a bill that would ban the use of PVC in consumer packaging due to the threats it poses to human and environmental health and its effect on the recycling stream. [ 39 ]  Specifically, the language of the bill analysis [ 40 ]  stipulates that EPA has listed PVC as a carcinogen. It is also further cites that there are concerns about the leaching of phthalates and lead from the PVC packaging.     [ edit ]   Recycling   The symbol, or ' SPI code ', for polyvinyl chloride developed by the  Society of the Plastics Industry  so that items can be labeled for easy recycling is:    The  Unicode  character for this symbol is U+2675 (HTML  character reference  &#9845;).   Post-consumer PVC is not typically recycled due to the prohibitive cost of regrinding and recompounding the resin compared to the cost of virgin (unrecycled) resin. [ citation needed ]   Some PVC manufacturers have placed vinyl recycling programs into action, recycling both manufacturing waste back into their products, as well as post consumer PVC construction materials to reduce the load on landfills. [ citation needed ]   The  thermal depolymerization  process can safely and efficiently convert PVC into fuel and minerals, according to the company that developed it. It is not yet in widespread use.   A new process of  PVC recycling  is being developed in Europe called Texiloop. [ 41 ]  This process is based on a technology already applied industrially in Europe and Japan, called Vinyloop, which consists of recovering PVC plastic from composite materials through dissolution and precipitation. It strives to be a closed loop system, recycling its key solvent and hopefully making PVC a future  technical nutrient .

[ citation needed ]  In terms of  revenue  generated, it is one of the most valuable products of the  chemical industry . Around the world, over 50% of PVC manufactured is used in construction. As a building material, PVC is cheap, durable, and easy to assemble. The PVC world market grew with an average rate of approximately 5% in the last years and will probably reach a volume of 40 million tons by the year 2016.   It can be made softer and more flexible by the addition of  plasticizers , the most widely-used being  phthalates . In this form, it is used in  clothing  and  upholstery , and to make flexible  hoses  and tubing,  flooring , to roofing membranes, and electrical cable insulation. It is also commonly used in figurines and in inflatable products such as  waterbeds ,  pool  toys or jump houses.

Since about 57% of its mass is  chlorine , creating a given mass of PVC requires less  petroleum  than many other polymers. [ citation needed ]         By far the most widely used production process is suspension polymerization. In this process, VCM and water are introduced into the polymerization reactor and a polymerization initiator, along with other chemical additives, are added to initiate the polymerization reaction. The contents of the reaction vessel are continually mixed to maintain the suspension and ensure a uniform particle size of the PVC resin. The reaction is  exothermic , and thus requires a cooling mechanism to maintain the reactor contents at the appropriate temperature. As the volumes also contract during the reaction (PVC is denser than VCM), water is continually added to the mixture to maintain the suspension.   Once the reaction has run its course, the resulting PVC slurry is degassed and stripped to remove excess VCM (which is recycled into the next batch) then passed though a centrifuge to remove most of the excess water. The slurry is then dried further in a hot air bed and the resulting powder sieved before storage or pelletization. In normal operations, the resulting PVC has a VCM content of less than 1  part per million .   Other production processes, such as micro-suspension polymerization and emulsion polymerization, produce PVC with smaller particle sizes (10m vs 120-150m for suspension PVC) with slightly different properties and with somewhat different sets of applications.     [ edit ]   History   Polyvinyl chloride was accidentally discovered on at least two different occasions in the 19th century, first in 1835 by  Henri Victor Regnault  and in 1872 by  Eugen Baumann . On both occasions, the  polymer  appeared as a white solid inside flasks of  vinyl chloride  that had been left exposed to sunlight. In the early 20th century, the Russian chemist  Ivan Ostromislensky  and  Fritz Klatte  of the German chemical company  Griesheim-Elektron  both attempted to use PVC (polyvinyl chloride) in commercial products, but difficulties in processing the rigid, sometimes brittle polymer blocked their efforts. In 1926,  Waldo Semon  and the  B.F. Goodrich  Company developed a method to  plasticize  PVC by blending it with various additives. The result was a more flexible and more easily-processed material that soon achieved widespread commercial use.     [ edit ]   Applications   PVC's intrinsic properties make it suitable for a wide variety of applications. It is biologically and chemically resistant, making it the plastic of choice for most household sewerage pipes and other pipe applications where corrosion would limit the use of metal.   With the addition of impact modifiers and stabilizers, it becomes a popular material for window and door frames. By adding plasticizers, it can become flexible enough to be used in cabling applications as a wire insulator.     [ edit ]   Clothing   PVC has become widely used in clothing either create a leather like material or at times simply for the effect of PVC. PVC clothing is common in Goth, Punk and other alternative fashions as well as in Fetish wear. PVC is cheaper than rubber, leather or latex and so it is more widely available and worn.   PVC fabric has a sheen to it and is waterproof. It is commonly used in coats, jackets, aprons and bags because of this.     [ edit ]   Electric wires   PVC is commonly used as the insulation on electric wires; the plastic used for this purpose needs to be  plasticized .   In a fire, PVC-coated wires can form  HCl  fumes; the chlorine serves to scavenge  free radicals  and is the source of the material's  fire retardance . While HCl fumes can also pose a health hazard in their own right, HCl dissolves in moisture and breaks down onto surfaces, particularly in areas where the air is cool enough to breathe, and is not available for inhalation. [ 3 ]  Frequently in applications where smoke is a major hazard (notably in tunnels) PVC-free  LSOH  (low-smoke, zero- halogen ) cable insulation is preferred.     [ edit ]   Pipes          PVC  pipes  in use with  intumescent   firestops  at Nortown Casitas,  North York, Ontario .       Polyvinyl chloride is also widely used for producing some forms of pipes. In the water distribution market it accounts for 66 percent of the market in the US, and in sanitary sewer pipe applications, it accounts for 75 percent. [ 4 ]  Its light weight, high strength, and low reactivity make it particularly well-suited to this purpose. In addition, PVC pipes can be fused together using various solvent cements, creating permanent joints that are virtually impervious to leakage. Despite PVC's many advantages, in cases where very high strength or ease of disassembly is necessary, metal pipes are still preferred.   In February 2007, the California Building Standards Code was updated to approve the use of  chlorinated polyvinyl chloride  (CPVC) pipe for use in residential water supply piping systems. CPVC has been a nationally-accepted material in the US since 1982; however, California has only permitted its use on a limited basis since 2001. The Department of Housing and Community Development prepared and certified an Environmental Impact Report resulting in a recommendation that the Commission adopt and approve the use of CPVC. The Commission's vote was unanimous and CPVC has been placed in the 2007 California Plumbing Code. [ 5 ]   In the United States and Canada, PVC pipes account for the largest majority of pipe materials used in buried municipal applications for drinking water distribution and wastewater mains. A detailed State-of-the-Art review of PVC pipes in North America can be found in an article titled Thermoplastics at Work: A Comprehensive Review of Municipal PVC Piping Products. [ 6 ]     [ edit ]   Portable Electronic Accessories   PVC is finding increased use as a composite for the production of accessories or housings for portable electronics. Through a fusing process, it can adopt cleaning properties possessed by materials such as wool or cotton which can absorb dust particles and bacteria. Its inherent ability to absorb particles from the LCD screen and its form fitting characteristics make it effective. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Signs   In flat sheet form, polyvinyl chloride is formed in a variety of thicknesses and colors. As flat sheets, PVC is often expanded to create voids in the interior of the material, providing additional thickness without additional weight and cost. Sheets are cut using saw and rotary cutting equipment. Plasticized PVC is also used to produce thin, colored, or clear, adhesive-backed films referred to simply as vinyl. These films are typically cut on a computer-controlled  plotter  or printed in a  wide-format printer . These sheets and films are used to produce a wide variety of  commercial signage  products and markings on vehicles.     [ edit ]   Unplasticized polyvinyl chloride (uPVC)          Modern "" Tudorbethan "" house with uPVC gutters and downpipes, fascia, decorative imitation "" half-timbering "", windows, and doors       uPVC or Rigid PVC is often used in the building industry as a low-maintenance material, particularly in the  UK , and in the  United States  where it is known as vinyl, or  vinyl siding . [ 7 ] [ 8 ]  The material comes in a range of colors and finishes, including a photo-effect wood finish, and is used as a substitute for painted wood, mostly for  window frames  and  sills  when installing  double glazing  in new buildings, or to replace older single glazed windows. It has many other uses including  fascia , and  siding  or  weatherboarding . The same material has almost entirely replaced the use of  cast iron  for  plumbing  and  drainage , being used for waste pipes, drainpipes,  gutters  and downpipes. [ 9 ]   Due to  environmental concerns  use of PVC is discouraged by some local authorities in countries such as  Germany  and  The Netherlands . [ 10 ] [ 11 ]  This concerns both flexible PVC and rigid uPVC as not only the plasticizers in PVC are seen as a problem but also the emissions from manufacturing and disposal. The use of modern impact modifiers offer great stability. The issues of migration and brittleness of the PVC compound are overcome. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Health and safety     [ edit ]   Phthalate plasticizers   Many vinyl products contain additional chemicals to change the chemical consistency of the product. Some of these additional chemicals called additives can leach out of vinyl products.  Plasticizers  that must be added to make PVC flexible have been an additive of particular concern.   Because soft PVC toys have been made for babies for years, there are concerns that these additives leach out of soft toys into the mouths of the children chewing on them. Additionally, adult  sex toys  have been demonstrated to contain high concentrations of the additives. [ 12 ]  In January 2006, the European Union placed a ban on six types of phthalate softeners, including DEHP ( diethylhexyl phthalate ), used in toys. [ 13 ]  In the U.S. most companies have voluntarily stopped manufacturing PVC toys with DEHP and in 2003 the US Consumer Product Safety Commission ( CPSC ) denied a petition for a ban on PVC toys made with an alternative plasticizer, DINP ( diisononyl phthalate ). [ 14 ]  In April 2006, the  European Chemicals Bureau  of the  European Commission  published an assessment of DINP which found risk ""unlikely"" for children and newborns. [ 15 ]   Vinyl  IV  bags used in neo-natal  intensive care  units have also been shown to leach DEHP. In a draft guidance paper published in September 2002, the US FDA recognizes that many medical devices with PVC containing DEHP are not used in ways that result in significant human exposure to the chemical. [1]  However, FDA is suggesting that manufacturers consider eliminating the use of DEHP in certain devices that can result in high aggregate exposures for sensitive patient populations such as neonates.   Other vinyl products, including car interiors, shower curtains, flooring, initially release chemical gases into the  air . Some studies indicate that this  outgassing  of additives may contribute to health complications, and have resulted in a call for banning the use of DEHP on shower curtains, among other uses. [ 16 ]  The Japanese car companies  Toyota ,  Nissan , and  Honda  have eliminated PVC in their car interiors starting in 2007.   In 2004, a joint Swedish-Danish research team found a statistical association between allergies in children and indoor air levels of DEHP and BBzP ( butyl benzyl phthalate ), which is used in vinyl flooring. [ 17 ]  In December 2006, the European Chemicals Bureau of the European Commission released a final draft risk assessment of BBzP which found ""no concern"" for consumer exposure including exposure to children. [ 18 ]   In November 2005, one of the largest hospital networks in the U.S.,  Catholic Healthcare West , signed a contract with  B.Braun  for vinyl-free  intravenous  bags and tubing. [ 19 ]  According to the  Center for Health, Environment & Justice  in  Falls Church, VA , which helps to coordinate a ""precautionary"" ""  PVC Campaign "", several major corporations including  Microsoft ,  Wal-Mart , and  Kaiser Permanente   announced efforts to eliminate PVC  from products and packaging in 2005. Even Target is reducing its sale of items with PVC. ( http://besafenet.com/pvc/newsreleases/target_to_reduce_use.htm )   The FDA Paper titled ""Safety Assessment of Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP)Released from PVC Medical Devices"" states that [3.2.1.3] Critically ill or injured patients may be at increased risk of developing adverse health effects from DEHP, not only by virtue of increased exposure, relative to the general population, but also because of the physiological and pharmacodynamic changes that occur in these patients, compared to healthy individuals. [ 20 ]   In 2008, The European Union's Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) reviewed the safety of DEHP in medical devices.  The SCENIHR report  states that certain medical procedures used in high risk patients result in a significant exposure to DEHP and concludes there is still a reason for having some concerns about the exposure of prematurely born male babies to medical devices containing DEHP. The Committee said there are some alternative plasticisers available for which there is sufficient toxicological data to indicate a lower hazard compared to DEHP but added that the functionality of these plasticisers should be assessed before they can be used as an alternative for DEHP in PVC medical devices.     [ edit ]   Vinyl chloride monomer   In the early 1970s, Dr. John Creech and Dr. Maurice Johnson were the first to clearly link and recognize the carcinogenicity of  vinyl chloride  monomer to humans when workers in the polyvinyl chloride polymerization section of a B.F. Goodrich plant near Louisville, Kentucky, were diagnosed with liver  angiosarcoma  also known as  hemangiosarcoma , a rare disease. [ 21 ]  Since that time, studies of PVC workers in Australia, Italy, Germany, and the UK have all associated certain types of occupational cancers with exposure to vinyl chloride. The link between angiosarcoma of the liver and long-term exposure to vinyl chloride is the only one that has been confirmed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. All the cases of angiosarcoma developed from exposure to vinyl chloride monomer, were in workers who were exposed to very high VCM levels, routinely, for many years. These workers cleaned accretions in reactors, a practice that has now been replaced by automated high pressure water jets.   A 1997 U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report concluded that the development and acceptance by the PVC industry of a closed loop polymerization process in the late 1970s ""almost completely eliminated worker exposures"" and that ""new cases of hepatic angiosarcoma in vinyl chloride polymerization workers have been virtually eliminated."" [ 22 ]   According to the EPA, ""vinyl chloride emissions from polyvinyl chloride (PVC),  ethylene dichloride  (EDC), and  vinyl chloride  monomer (VCM) plants cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to result in an increase in mortality or an increase in serious irreversible, or incapacitating reversible illness. Vinyl chloride is a known human carcinogen that causes a rare cancer of the liver."" [ 23 ]  EPA's 2001 updated Toxicological Profile and Summary Health Assessment for VCM in its Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) database lowers EPA's previous risk factor estimate by a factor of 20 and concludes that ""because of the consistent evidence for liver cancer in all the studies...and the weaker association for other sites, it is concluded that the liver is the most sensitive site, and protection against liver cancer will protect against possible  cancer induction  in other tissues."" [ 24 ]   A 1998 front-page series in the  Houston Chronicle  claimed the vinyl industry has manipulated vinyl chloride studies to avoid liability for worker exposure and to hide extensive and severe chemical spills into local communities. [ 25 ]  Retesting of community residents in 2001 by the U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) found dioxin levels similar to those in a comparison community in Louisiana and to the U.S. population. [ 26 ]  Cancer rates in the community were similar to Louisiana and US averages. [ 27 ]     [ edit ]   Dioxins   The environmentalist group  Greenpeace  has advocated the global phase-out of PVC because they claim  dioxin  is produced as a byproduct of  vinyl chloride  manufacture and from incineration of waste PVC in domestic garbage. The European Industry, however, asserts [ citation needed ]  that it has improved production processes to minimize dioxin emissions.   Also, scientific tests wherein municipal refuse containing several known concentrations of PVC was burned in a commercial-scale incinerator showed no relationship between the PVC content of the waste and dioxin emissions. [ 28 ]   [ 29 ]   PVC produces HCl upon combustion almost quantitatively related to its chlorine content. Extensive studies in Europe indicate that the chlorine found in emitted dioxins is not derived from HCl in the flue gases. Instead, most dioxins arise in the condensed solid phase by the reaction of inorganic chlorides with graphitic structures in char-containing ash particles. Copper acts as a catalyst for these reactions. [ 30 ]   Dioxins are a global health threat because they persist in the environment and can travel long distances. At very low levels, near those to which the general population is exposed, dioxins have been linked [ citation needed ]  to immune system suppression, reproductive disorders, a variety of cancers, and  endometriosis . According to a 1994 report by the British firm, ICI Chemicals & Polymers Ltd., ""It has been known since the publication of a paper in 1989 that these oxychlorination reactions [used to make vinyl chloride and some chlorinated solvents] generate polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs) and dibenzofurans (PCDFs). The reactions include all of the ingredients and conditions necessary to form PCDD/PCDFs.... It is difficult to see how any of these conditions could be modified so as to prevent PCDD/PCDF formation without seriously impairing the reaction for which the process is designed."" In other words, dioxins are an undesirable byproduct of producing vinyl chloride and eliminating the production of dioxins while maintaining the oxychlorination reaction may be difficult. Dioxins created by vinyl chloride production are released by on-site incinerators, flares, boilers, wastewater treatment systems and even in trace quantities in vinyl resins. [ 31 ]  The US EPA estimate of dioxin releases from the PVC industry was 13 grams TEQ in 1995, or less than 0.5% of the total dioxin emissions in the US; by 2002, PVC industry dioxin emissions had been further reduced by 23%. [ 32 ]   The largest well-quantified source of dioxin in the US EPA inventory of dioxin sources is barrel burning of household waste. [ 33 ]  Studies of household waste burning indicate consistent increases in dioxin generation with increasing PVC concentrations. [ 34 ]  According to the EPA dioxin inventory,  landfill fires  are likely to represent an even larger source of dioxin to the environment. A survey of international studies consistently identifies high dioxin concentrations in areas affected by open waste burning and a study that looked at the homologue pattern found the sample with the highest dioxin concentration was ""typical for the pyrolysis of PVC"". Other EU studies indicate that PVC likely ""accounts for the overwhelming majority of chlorine that is available for dioxin formation during landfill fires."" [ 35 ]   The next largest sources of dioxin in the EPA inventory are medical and municipal waste incinerators. [ 36 ]  Studies have shown a clear correlation between dioxin formation and chloride content and indicate that PVC is a significant contributor to the formation of both dioxin and PCB in incinerators. [ 37 ]   In February 2007, the Technical and Scientific Advisory Committee of the US Green Building Council (USGBC) released its report on a PVC avoidance related materials credit for the LEED Green Building Rating system. The report concludes that ""no single material shows up as the best across all the human health and environmental impact categories, nor as the worst"" but that the ""risk of dioxin emissions puts PVC consistently among the worst materials for human health impacts.""  [ 38 ]     [ edit ]   Bans   The State of California is currently considering a bill that would ban the use of PVC in consumer packaging due to the threats it poses to human and environmental health and its effect on the recycling stream. [ 39 ]  Specifically, the language of the bill analysis [ 40 ]  stipulates that EPA has listed PVC as a carcinogen. It is also further cites that there are concerns about the leaching of phthalates and lead from the PVC packaging.     [ edit ]   Recycling   The symbol, or ' SPI code ', for polyvinyl chloride developed by the  Society of the Plastics Industry  so that items can be labeled for easy recycling is:    The  Unicode  character for this symbol is U+2675 (HTML  character reference  &#9845;).   Post-consumer PVC is not typically recycled due to the prohibitive cost of regrinding and recompounding the resin compared to the cost of virgin (unrecycled) resin. [ citation needed ]   Some PVC manufacturers have placed vinyl recycling programs into action, recycling both manufacturing waste back into their products, as well as post consumer PVC construction materials to reduce the load on landfills. [ citation needed ]   The  thermal depolymerization  process can safely and efficiently convert PVC into fuel and minerals, according to the company that developed it. It is not yet in widespread use.   A new process of  PVC recycling  is being developed in Europe called Texiloop. [ 41 ]  This process is based on a technology already applied industrially in Europe and Japan, called Vinyloop, which consists of recovering PVC plastic from composite materials through dissolution and precipitation. It strives to be a closed loop system, recycling its key solvent and hopefully making PVC a future  technical nutrient .

clueweb09-enwp03-31-18387	"                     Weatherstripping          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Weather-stripping )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search          Weatherstripping  is the process of sealing openings such as doors, windows, and trunks from the elements. The goal of weatherstripping is to prevent rain and water from entering by either blocking it outright or by blocking most of it and returning or rerouting it. A secondary goal of weatherstripping is to keep interior air in, thus saving energy with heating and air conditioning.   The materials used in weatherstripping are thresholds, a piece of material, either a sweep or a  J-hook , to match the door to the threshold, and the actual weathstripping itself.   Every exterior door, or door to an uninsulated room such as an attic, must be weatherstripped as required by  code enforcement  in various states of U.S. Doors can usually be divided into private homes and commercial properties. Some of these doors receive custom weatherstripping at the factory.   Weatherstripping is needed on on all openings between interior and exterior locations. Automobiles have large amounts of weatherstripping. Consider a standard 4 door vehicle: the doors may require 20 feet or more per door depending on the size of the opening. Windows will require upwards of 10 feet. Trunks require large amounts. Automotive weatherstipping has added difficulties that must be considered in the engineering of the parts. For example, the weatherstrip must function equally at keeping rain out when the vehicle is parked as when it is screaming down the autobahn. Automotive weatherstripping must endure extreme temperatures (hot and cold); be resistant to automotive liquids such as oil, gasoline, and particularly windshield washerfluid; and must resist years of full sun exposure. Automobile designers wish to have design continuity: all weatherseals should appear the same. This is a problem as they will likely be manufactured of different materials by different manufacturers. Likely the most significant issue is that of noise. After paint quality, interior noise is the second most important factor in car quality as perceived by the consumer. When automobiles go over bumps the car flexs and vibrates causing relative motions between the relatively fixed body and movable parts like doors, windows, and sunroofs. This movement could allow water in the vehicle so the weatherstrip must compensate by filling the gap. What is worse, this relative movement can cause noises such as squeaks, rattles, and itches to be heard within the vehicle. Many of these issues can be alleviated if the weatherstrip manufacturer coats the weatherstrip with specialty coatings. These coatings bond to the weatherstrip, provide chemical and UV resistance, decrease the coefficient of friction reducing the force required to open or close doors, and reduce or eliminate noise associated with weatherstripping. Not all vehicles have coated weatherstripping which means the weatherstripping is much more likely to cause the above mentioned issues along with others such as premature failure of the paint causing rusting. This is a very surprising situation given that the cost of the coating is less than 1 to 3 dollars per vehicle whereas the rubber and steel is tens of dollars (an entire car set of weatherstripping may be worth 100 to 300 dollars in the total cost of the vehicle which includes all labour and costs of the manufacturing equipement).   Automotive weatherstripping is commonly made of EPDM, TPE, TPO. Sunroof weatherstripping can also be made of silicone due to the extreme heat that parts on automobile roofs commonly encounter. Coatings for weatherstripping must adhere to all of these weatherstrip materials. Such coatings are commonly available (silicone is very difficult to adhere to, however at least one coating is commercially available for this purpose), however, like other paints and coatings, a large variety coatings are available and these have a large variety of coating performances. Poorly performing weatherstripping should be reported to the car dealership if the vehicle is under warranty as fixes may be known.     [ edit ]   Custom Weatherstripping   Custom weatherstripping, contrary to pre-weatherstripped units, require much more time and is considered to be a specialized skill.   Weatherstrippers install a threshold, cut the door and install a sweep or J-hook to the bottom of the door, and nail spring-steel bronze into the door jamb to seal the gap.     [ edit ]   Pre-Weatherstripped doors   Pre-weatherstripped doors for private homes are usually made of fiberglass or a similar material and are shipped from the factory weatherstripped, hence the pre-weatherstripped. The doors have a kerf in the door stop so that a foam, rubber, or vinyl strip can be placed inside for the door to rest against when closed. These doors also have the threshold - usually a molded piece of plastic - nailed to the frame in the factory. These units are not difficult to install and require very little skill for a trim carpenter where a weather-stripper is required for custom weatherstripping.

The goal of weatherstripping is to prevent rain and water from entering by either blocking it outright or by blocking most of it and returning or rerouting it. A secondary goal of weatherstripping is to keep interior air in, thus saving energy with heating and air conditioning.   The materials used in weatherstripping are thresholds, a piece of material, either a sweep or a  J-hook , to match the door to the threshold, and the actual weathstripping itself.   Every exterior door, or door to an uninsulated room such as an attic, must be weatherstripped as required by  code enforcement  in various states of U.S. Doors can usually be divided into private homes and commercial properties. Some of these doors receive custom weatherstripping at the factory.   Weatherstripping is needed on on all openings between interior and exterior locations. Automobiles have large amounts of weatherstripping. Consider a standard 4 door vehicle: the doors may require 20 feet or more per door depending on the size of the opening. Windows will require upwards of 10 feet. Trunks require large amounts. Automotive weatherstipping has added difficulties that must be considered in the engineering of the parts. For example, the weatherstrip must function equally at keeping rain out when the vehicle is parked as when it is screaming down the autobahn. Automotive weatherstripping must endure extreme temperatures (hot and cold); be resistant to automotive liquids such as oil, gasoline, and particularly windshield washerfluid; and must resist years of full sun exposure. Automobile designers wish to have design continuity: all weatherseals should appear the same. This is a problem as they will likely be manufactured of different materials by different manufacturers. Likely the most significant issue is that of noise. After paint quality, interior noise is the second most important factor in car quality as perceived by the consumer. When automobiles go over bumps the car flexs and vibrates causing relative motions between the relatively fixed body and movable parts like doors, windows, and sunroofs. This movement could allow water in the vehicle so the weatherstrip must compensate by filling the gap. What is worse, this relative movement can cause noises such as squeaks, rattles, and itches to be heard within the vehicle. Many of these issues can be alleviated if the weatherstrip manufacturer coats the weatherstrip with specialty coatings. These coatings bond to the weatherstrip, provide chemical and UV resistance, decrease the coefficient of friction reducing the force required to open or close doors, and reduce or eliminate noise associated with weatherstripping. Not all vehicles have coated weatherstripping which means the weatherstripping is much more likely to cause the above mentioned issues along with others such as premature failure of the paint causing rusting. This is a very surprising situation given that the cost of the coating is less than 1 to 3 dollars per vehicle whereas the rubber and steel is tens of dollars (an entire car set of weatherstripping may be worth 100 to 300 dollars in the total cost of the vehicle which includes all labour and costs of the manufacturing equipement).   Automotive weatherstripping is commonly made of EPDM, TPE, TPO. Sunroof weatherstripping can also be made of silicone due to the extreme heat that parts on automobile roofs commonly encounter. Coatings for weatherstripping must adhere to all of these weatherstrip materials. Such coatings are commonly available (silicone is very difficult to adhere to, however at least one coating is commercially available for this purpose), however, like other paints and coatings, a large variety coatings are available and these have a large variety of coating performances. Poorly performing weatherstripping should be reported to the car dealership if the vehicle is under warranty as fixes may be known.     [ edit ]   Custom Weatherstripping   Custom weatherstripping, contrary to pre-weatherstripped units, require much more time and is considered to be a specialized skill.   Weatherstrippers install a threshold, cut the door and install a sweep or J-hook to the bottom of the door, and nail spring-steel bronze into the door jamb to seal the gap.     [ edit ]   Pre-Weatherstripped doors   Pre-weatherstripped doors for private homes are usually made of fiberglass or a similar material and are shipped from the factory weatherstripped, hence the pre-weatherstripped. The doors have a kerf in the door stop so that a foam, rubber, or vinyl strip can be placed inside for the door to rest against when closed. These doors also have the threshold - usually a molded piece of plastic - nailed to the frame in the factory. These units are not difficult to install and require very little skill for a trim carpenter where a weather-stripper is required for custom weatherstripping.

Has the personal property tax been phased out?                         Yes. Returns due in 2008 were the final returns for all general business taxpayers. No annual or new taxpayer returns, either form 920 or 945, are required to be filed for tax years 2009 and thereafter. This is a direct result of the listing percentage being reduced to zero as the final component of the phase-out.                         Return to Top                         2. Are there exceptions to the phase-out?                          Telephone and inter-exchange telecommunications companies, or entities leasing property to telephone and inter-exchange telecommunications companies, will continue to be subject to the tangible personal property tax.                         Return to Top                         3. Besides the types of companies named as exceptions, who does the information in the remaining FAQs pertain to?                         Any entities, who were subject to the tangible personal property tax in taxable year 2008 or any year before 2008,  who failed to file a return for the taxable year. The information also pertains to any formerly subject entities who may be assessed for the tax through an audit.                         Return to Top   4.  Are there any changes to be aware of when filing my 2008 personal property tax return?   Yes. As part of Ohios tax reform initiative, Am. Sub. H.B. 66, the tangible personal property tax on general business machinery and equipment, furniture and fixtures, and inventories is phased out over a four year period. The listing percentages  applicable to  all  property reported in Schedules 2, 3, 3A and 4 - for the phase-out period can be found in Ohio Revised Code (R.C.) 5711.22 and are as follows:                                Return Year            Listing %                           2006            18.75%                           2007            12.50%                           2008             6.25%                           2009             0.00%                           Additionally, all  manufacturing equipment  first placed in service in Ohio by a manufacturer  on or after Jan. 1, 2005 , is immediately exempt. Manufacturing equipment includes machinery, equipment, tools, implements and patterns, jigs dies & drawings used at a manufacturing facility by a manufacturer. A manufacturing facility is a facility or portion of a facility used for manufacturing, mining, refining, rectifying or combining different materials with a view to profit.    In addition to supplying new definitions for manufacturing equipment and manufacturing facility, R.C. 5711.16, as amended by Am. Sub. H.B. 66, provides definitions for manufacturer and manufacturing inventory. New manufacturing equipment meeting this definition should be listed at zero percent of its true value beginning with the 2006 return (R.C. 5711.22). A new schedule   Schedule 5  - has been added to the 920 and 945 tax forms to report only that manufacturing equipment that is exempt as a result of this law change.    All manufacturing equipment first used in business prior to Jan. 1, 2005 is required to be listed and assessed in Schedule 2. Note that the new manufacturing definitions apply to property required to be listed in Schedule 2. Only taxpayers meeting the new manufacturing definitions should report the value of manufacturing equipment placed in service prior to Jan. 1, 2005, in Schedule 2.

Does the incineration of PVC cause the emission of large amounts of dioxins?   Can rigid PVC pipes be recycled?   Does PVC pollute soil and groundwater when disposed of in landfills?       What is PVC?   Polyvinyl chloride or PVC and sometimes called Vinyl is the world's most versatile plastic , used to make everything from food wrap to auto body parts to water pipes. PVC is composed  of two simple building blocks: 60% chlorine, based on common salt and 40% ethylene from crude oil   The resulting compound, ethylene dichloride, is converted at very high temperatures to vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) gas. Through the chemical reaction known as polymerization, VCM becomes a chemically stable powder, polyvinyl chloride resin.     PVC resin can be combined with a wide range of other materials such as plasticisers, stabilisers, lubricants and colorants to produce rigid (i.e. pipes) or flexible (i.e. raincoats) products. Not all PVC products use the same combination of materials   PVC is the second largest-selling plastic and the most versatile one and is used in hundreds of consumer and industrial products everywhere in the world.     Is Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) hazardous?   Like many manufacturing processes, the production of PVC involves the use of materials that can be hazardous if improperly handled. The raw material vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) is the chief concern.    In the 1970s, the industry and scientists discovered a link between prolonged, high-level exposure to VCM among PVC production workers and a rare form of liver cancer called angiosarcoma. Radical changes to technology and processes were then rapidly introduced to protect the health of workers.    Today, the polyvinyl chloride production process is closed, with activities involving VCM taking place in sealed vessels. This minimises potential worker exposure, reduces environmental emissions and flammability risks. Exposure limits are now below one-thousandth of what they used to be, and no cases of the cancer have been detected in workers joining the industry since that time    The raw material polyvinyl chloride resin used in the production of PVC pipes is not manufactured in New Zealand but is all imported from Australia and Asia using certified manufacturing plants    No member of the general public is known to have suffered any harmful effect from VCM.     What are Dioxins?   'Dioxins' is a general term for polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs). These are created in small amounts in a variety of synthetic and natural chemical processes. Agricultural burning off, incineration, forest fires, metal smelting, and certain industrial processes involving chlorine and other organic compounds all have the potential to create dioxins.    Dioxins are toxic and carcinogenic to some animals. The International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified the dioxin 2,3,7,8-TCDD as a known human carcinogen.    The level of dioxins in the global environment peaked in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Japanese Government data shows that daily human intake of dioxins fell by 75 per cent between 1977 and 1998 1 . The US EPA has reported that dioxin emissions in the US fell by 80 per cent between 1987 and 1995 2 .    The principal societal sources of dioxins in most western nations are municipal and medical waste incinerators 3 . It is widely believed that the primary means of further reducing the emission of dioxins is through the control of incinerator operating practices. This is less applicable in Australia, where most medical waste incinerators are relatively modern, and where there is only one, very modern municipal waste incinerator (Wollongong).    A 1998 report for Environment Australia estimates that 60-80% of dioxin emissions to air in Australia arise from agricultural burning off, residential wood combustion and bushfires. Waste incinerators and halogen chemical manufacture (including chlorine and PVC production), together contribute less than 1% to the total. This report is available on-line at http://www.ea.gov.au/industry/chemicals/dioxins/pubs/dioxins.pdf .     Another Environment Australia review  (at  http://www.ea.gov.au/industry/chemicals/dioxins/pubs/review.pdf ) includes the following comment on PVC:    ""In general, the trend data (eg Alcock & Jones, 1996) support a conclusion that rates of dioxin emission and deposition are linked to a few specific chemical and industrial processes rather than to the additional production of chlorine and the increasing use of PVC.""    Global levels of dioxins in the environment have been falling for 20 years .   PVC resin production has trebled in the same period.    The Swedish EPA found that ""a reduction in the PVC content of waste will not change the amount of dioxin emissions in flue gases, or significantly reduce the dioxin content in residual products from flue-gas treatment plants."" 5     A similar, broader finding was reached in a major study in 1995 by Rigo et al. In an analysis of data from 31 medical waste incinerators, he found ""there is no statistically significant relationship between the composition or amount of (dioxin/furan) concentrations in the gases emitted from the MWIs and the amount of chlorine in the waste feed."" 6     Rigo reached a similar conclusion on data from 63 municipal waste combustors     Do Polyvinyl Chloride resin factories emit large amounts of dioxin into the environment?   No. Studies in Australia, the US, UK and the Netherlands have shown that only very small amounts of dioxin can be attributed to VCM or PVC production. Dioxin emissions in Europe and the US have halved in the last thirty years while PVC production has increased 300%. In Australia, it is estimated that 60-80% of dioxin emissions to air arise from agricultural burning off, residential wood combustion and bushfires. The manufacture in Australia of all chemicals based on chlorine (i.e. halogen chemicals) contributes less than 1% to the total.      Are dioxins present in the PVC resin that is used to make everyday products?   No. Dioxins have not been found in PVC resin at the limits of detection, even using today's highly advanced measurement techniques. PVC resins or polymer are chemically stable, neutral and non toxic       The role of Chlorine in today World    Chlorine is an element with the chemical symbol Cl. It does not naturally exist in a pure state but can be manufactured from a number of sources, most commonly salt, or sodium chloride. There are many naturally occurring, widely abundant chlorine compounds. Chlorine's chemical nature is closely related to fluorine, bromine and iodine, a group of chemicals known as halogens.    Chlorine is a highly reactive substance with the ability to combine directly with other elements. This is one of the reasons it has become such an important chemical in today's society.    Chlorine is used in the manufacture of many of the products today's society depends on, including medicine, water purification, building products, paints, paper and plastics.    For more information on chlorine visit   www.orica.com.au )      How much manufactured chlorine goes into the PVC industry?   Worldwide, about 35% of chlorine produced is used in the PVC industry. Chlorine is one of the most commonly occurring elements. Man-made chlorine is vital to many industries producing valuable modern products.     How does PVC Perform?    Because PVC resin can be combined with many additives and modifiers, PVC can meet the requirements for an exceedingly wide range of products in many industries.    PVC is often chosen over other materials because of its low cost, versatility and performance properties.    PVC is strong, durable, abrasion and moisture resistant; withstands rust and corrosion; is electrically non-conductive and has excellent fire performance properties.    PVC can be produced in almost any color, with end products ranging from opaque to crystal-clear.    Through a variety of processes, PVC can be modified to produce products as rigid as pipe or as flexible as upholstery and food wrap.    Because it contains less than half petroleum based material, PVC is the most energy-efficient plastic. And because it has been used for more than a half century, it is one of the world's most analysed and tested materials.      A major basic component of PVC is salt an inexpensive renewable resource.    PVC products consume less energy, generate fewer emissions and save more energy than many competitive products     Most PVC products are durable and long-lived with pipes having a design life of 100years    What impact do PVC Additives have?   Additives typically constitute a small part of the overall PVC formulation and their use is closely regulated. All additives used in food and drug applications must have specific regulatory clearance    Plasticisers  are used as softening agents and provide low temperature flexibility and weldability in flexible PVC products   Phthalate ester plasticizers have been safely used for more than 50 years and are some of the most studied compounds in the United States from a health and environmental viewpoint. These plasticizers are used in wire and cable products, medical devices, toys, flooring, shower curtains and synthetic leathers such as automotive upholstery, as well as in pharmaceuticals and personal care products such as cosmetics and lotions.   There have been no confirmed reports of adverse health from phthalate exposure. A full report on the safety of phthalates was published by the American Council on Science and Health and is available on  http://search.medscape.com/px/mscpsearch?QueryText=phthalate+safety&searchfor=Clinical&cid=med                      Plasticisers are not used in the manufacture of rigid PVC pipes    Stabilisers:  Many polymers, including PVC, require additives during the manufacturing process. Individual additives include heat and light stabilizers, colorants, impact modifiers, processing aids.    These include the metals tin, barium, zinc, calcium and, decreasingly, lead and cadmium. Most stabilisers are used in rigid PVC applications such as pipe and other construction products thanks to their processability and durability.    Lead-based stabilizers are used principally in PVC wire and cable insulation. No lead is used in PVC potable water pipes manufactured in New Zealand and nearly all other PVC rigid pipe products produced here are lead free now with total lead phase out planned for the end of 2006. .    Because the additives are firmly bound within a rigid PVC matrix, there is no mechanism by which these additives can escape into the environment at levels that pose a health risk to humans. The CSIRO (REFERENCE SITE) found that under normal use conditions of PVC pipe; its contribution to levels of lead in the environment is small relative to contributions from other sources.    New studies affirm that disposal of metal-stabilised PVC waste in landfills poses no appreciable risk to human health or the environment. In fact, PVC sheet is used as landfill liner to help prevent leachate from contaminating groundwater, specifically because PVC is so resistant to the aggressive conditions typically found there.    In short, the demonstrated performance and scientific facts about stabilizers confirm that they are the right choice for most rigid PVC processing. Extensive testing and review have shown that there is no risk to processors, consumers or the environment when these stabilisers are used as intende d     What happens when PVC products burn?   PVC has low flammability and rate of heat release due to its low organic/high chlorine content. Pure PVC will self-extinguish once the external heat or flame source is removed. Rigid PVC materials such as those used for pipe, vertical blinds and siding, are recognised for their excellent fire retardant properties. The fire properties of flexible PVC products depend on the quantity and composition of plasticiser added     Is PVC a danger to people when a building catches fire?   The toxicity of building fire emissions from PVC is neither better nor worse than for many other common materials. The most important products in any fire are heat, smoke and carbon monoxide. These are produced by all organic materials when they burn. Hydrogen chloride is produced when chlorine-containing materials, including PVC are burnt. It is a common irritant gas, and has a very pungent odour so is quickly detected as opposed to carbon monoxide. At the levels encountered in building fires, hydrogen chloride remains an irritant and is not lethal. To our knowledge, no building fire fatality has ever been attributed to PVC by building fire authorities.     Does the incineration of PVC cause the emission of large amounts of dioxins?   It has been demonstrated that PVC in the waste stream of properly operated incinerators has a negligible effect on the amount of dioxins emitted. Dioxin emissions are primarily the result of combustion temperature and efficiency of operation, both of which can be controlled with the use of modern incineration technology. In Australia, it is estimated that agricultural burning off, bush fires, cement production and residential wood combustion are among the most significant contributors to dioxin emissions to air. Municipal waste incineration and halogen chemical manufacture contribute less than 1% to the total.     Can rigid PVC pipes be recycled?   PVC being thermoplastic material means that pipes can readily be recycled and reused in useful alternative products.  Worldwide there are many PVC recycling schemes in place    Pre consumer PVC pipe waste is easy to separate as part of the production process. This results in high quality recyclate material and a high recycling ratio. Currently New Zealand pipe manufacturers recycle almost 100% of pre consumer waste PVC.       Post consumer waste recycling s more difficult to achieve because of:     The degree of contamination with other materials     Differences in the composition or specification of the PVC waste     A regular supply of consistent quality waste   Consequently the level of PVC pipe post consumer recycling in New Zealand is low        Although recycling of plastics generally has gathered momentum over the last ten years it is only recently that building products such as pipes have been identified as potential recycling materials. PVC pipes form high quality recyclate waste but in low quantities as there is a considerable time lag between PVC consumption and PVC waste creation (Long useful service life for pipes). Also much of this pipe will remain buried after its operational life is over. That leaves pipe off cuts and demolition materials as other sources of scrap excluding imported material.    In New Zealand PVC pipes have been in use for the last 35 years and have an expected lifespan of 100 years or more. Meanwhile PIPA New Zealand is putting pilot schemes in place to look at increasing the level of post consumer recycling of PVC pipe as part of an ongoing commitment to a sustainable environment      Does PVC pollute soil and groundwater when disposed of in landfills?   Studies have been done to test whether PVC pollutes groundwater and soil in landfill. Such studies show that PVC does not degrade in landfill and is not expected to add to the toxicity of leachate. Minute quantities of metal stabilisers may leach from PVC but the quantities are considered an insignificant contribution to heavy metal concentrations in landfill. Although vinyl chloride gas may be present in landfill, it is formed from the degradation of chlorinated hydrocarbons not from PVC, which does not degrade.

[ 1 ]              Polyvinyl chloride       Polyvinyl chloride , ( IUPAC  Polychloroethene) commonly abbreviated  PVC , is a widely used  thermoplastic   polymer . In terms of  revenue  generated, it is one of the most valuable products of the  chemical industry . Around the world, over 50% of PVC manufactured is used in construction. As a building material, PVC is cheap, durable, and easy to assemble. In recent years, PVC has been replacing traditional  building materials  such as  wood ,  concrete  and  clay  in many areas. The use of non-PVC materials has been on the rise due to concerns about the environmental and toxicity characteristics of PVC. [ citation needed ]  Nevertheless, the PVC world market grew with an average rate of approximately 5% in the last years and will probably reach a volume of 40 milion tons by the year 2016. [ 2 ]  PVC is commonly recycled, and has the number ""3"" as its  recycling symbol .   Polyvinyl chloride is used in a variety of applications. As a hard plastic, it is used as  vinyl siding ,  magnetic stripe cards , window profiles,  gramophone records  (which is the source of the term  vinyl records ),  pipe ,  plumbing  and  conduit  fixtures. The material is often used in  Plastic Pressure Pipe Systems  for  pipelines  in the  water  and  sewer  industries because of its inexpensive nature and flexibility. PVC pipe plumbing is typically white, as opposed to  ABS , which is commonly available in grey and black, as well as white.   It can be made softer and more flexible by the addition of  plasticizers , the most widely-used being  phthalates . In this form, it is used in  clothing  and  upholstery , and to make flexible  hoses  and tubing,  flooring , to roofing membranes, and electrical cable insulation. It is also commonly used in figurines and in inflatable products such as pool toys or jump houses.

Since about 57% of its mass is  chlorine , creating a given mass of PVC requires less  petroleum  than many other polymers. [ citation needed ]       Chemical structure             History   Polyvinyl chloride was accidentally discovered on at least two different occasions in the 19th century, first in 1835 by  Henri Victor Regnault  and in 1872 by  Eugen Baumann . On both occasions, the  polymer  appeared as a white solid inside flasks of  vinyl chloride  that had been left exposed to sunlight. In the early 20th century, the Russian chemist Ivan Ostromislensky and  Fritz Klatte  of the German chemical company Griesheim-Elektron both attempted to use PVC (polyvinyl chloride) in commercial products, but difficulties in processing the rigid, sometimes brittle polymer blocked their efforts. In 1926,  Waldo Semon  and the  B.F. Goodrich  Company developed a method to  plasticize  PVC by blending it with various additives. The result was a more flexible and more easily-processed material that soon achieved widespread commercial use.       Applications       Electric wires   PVC is commonly used as the insulation on electric wires; the plastic used for this purpose needs to be  plasticized .   In a fire, PVC-coated wires can form  HCl  fumes; the chlorine serves to scavenge  free radicals  and is the source of the material's  fire retardance . While HCl fumes can also pose a health hazard in their own right, HCl dissolves in moisture and breaks down onto surfaces, particularly in areas where the air is cool enough to breathe, and is not available for inhalation. [ 3 ]  Frequently in applications where smoke is a major hazard (notably in tunnels) PVC-free  LSOH  (low-smoke, zero- halogen ) cable insulation is preferred. PVC insulation may be eaten or degraded by mice, termites,  antechinus  and  cockatoos .       Pipes          PVC  pipes  in use with  intumescent   firestops  at Nortown Casitas,  North York, Ontario .       Polyvinyl chloride is also widely used for producing some forms of pipes. In the water distribution market it accounts for 66 percent of the market in the US, and in sanitary sewer pipe applications, it accounts for 75 percent. [ 4 ]  Its light weight, high strength, and low reactivity make it particularly well-suited to this purpose. In addition, PVC pipes can be fused together using various solvent cements, creating permanent joints that are virtually impervious to leakage. Despite PVC's many advantages, in cases where very high strength or ease of disassembly is necessary, metal pipes are still preferred.   In February 2007, the California Building Standards Code was updated to approve the use of  chlorinated polyvinyl chloride  (CPVC) pipe for use in residential water supply piping systems. CPVC has been a nationally-accepted material in the US since 1982; however, California has only permitted its use on a limited basis since 2001. The Department of Housing and Community Development prepared and certified an Environmental Impact Report resulting in a recommendation that the Commission adopt and approve the use of CPVC. The Commission's vote was unanimous and CPVC has been placed in the 2007 California Plumbing Code. [ 5 ]   In the United States and Canada, PVC pipes account for the largest majority of pipe materials used in buried municipal applications for drinking water distribution and wastewater mains. A detailed State-of-the-Art review of PVC pipes in North America can be found in an article titled Thermoplastics at Work: A Comprehensive Review of Municipal PVC Piping Products. [ 6 ]       Portable Electronic Accessories   PVC is finding increased use as a composite for the production of accessories or housings for portable electronics. Through a fusing process, it can adopt cleaning properties possessed by materials such as wool or cotton which can absorb dust particles and bacteria. Its inherent ability to absorb particles from the LCD screen and its form fitting characteristics make it effective. [ citation needed ]       Signs   In flat sheet form, polyvinyl chloride is formed in a variety of thicknesses and colors. As flat sheets, PVC is often expanded to create voids in the interior of the material, providing additional thickness without additional weight and cost. Sheets are cut using saw and rotary cutting equipment. Plasticized PVC is also used to produce thin, colored, or clear, adhesive-backed films referred to simply as vinyl. These films are typically cut on a computer-controlled  plotter  or printed in a  wide-format printer . These sheets and films are used to produce a wide variety of  commercial signage  products and markings on vehicles.       Unplasticized polyvinyl chloride (uPVC)          Modern "" Tudorbethan "" house with uPVC gutters and downpipes, fascia, decorative imitation "" half-timbering "", windows and doors.       uPVC or Rigid PVC is often used in the building industry as a low-maintenance material, particularly in the  UK , and in the  United States  where it is known as vinyl, or  vinyl siding . [ 7 ] [ 8 ] . The material comes in a range of colors and finishes, including a photo-effect wood finish, and is used as a substitute for painted wood, mostly for  window frames  and  sills  when installing  double glazing  in new buildings, or to replace older single glazed windows. It has many other uses including  fascia , and  siding  or  weatherboarding . The same material has almost entirely replaced the use of  cast iron  for  plumbing  and  drainage , being used for waste pipes, drainpipes,  gutters  and downpipes. [ 9 ]   Due to  environmental concerns [ 10 ]  use of PVC is discouraged by some local authorities [ 11 ]  in countries such as  Germany  and  The Netherlands . This concerns both flexible PVC and rigid uPVC as not only the plasticizers in PVC are seen as a problem but also the emissions from manufacturing and disposal. The use of modern impact modifiers offer great stability. The issues of migration and brittleness of the PVC compound are overcome. [ citation needed ]       Health and safety       Phthalate plasticizers   Many vinyl products contain additional chemicals to change the chemical consistency of the product. Some of these additional chemicals called  additives  can leach out of vinyl products.  Plasticizers  that must be added to make PVC flexible have been an additive of particular concern.   Because soft PVC toys have been made for babies for years, there are concerns that these additives leach out of soft toys into the mouths of the children chewing on them. Additionally, adult  sex toys  have been demonstrated to contain high concentrations of the additives. [ 12 ]  In January 2006, the European Union placed a ban on six types of phthalate softeners, including DEHP ( diethylhexyl phthalate ), used in toys. [ 13 ]  In the U.S. most companies have voluntarily stopped manufacturing PVC toys with DEHP and in 2003 the US Consumer Product Safety Commission ( CPSC ) denied a petition for a ban on PVC toys made with an alternative plasticizer, DINP ( diisononyl phthalate ). [ 14 ]  In April 2006, the  European Chemicals Bureau  of the  European Commission  published an assessment of DINP which found risk ""unlikely"" for children and newborns. [ 15 ]   Vinyl  IV  bags used in neo-natal  intensive care  units have also been shown to leach DEHP. In a draft guidance paper published in September 2002, the US FDA recognizes that many medical devices with PVC containing DEHP are not used in ways that result in significant human exposure to the chemical [1] . However, FDA is suggesting that manufacturers consider eliminating the use of DEHP in certain devices that can result in high aggregate exposures for sensitive patient populations such as neonates.   Other vinyl products, including car interiors, shower curtains, flooring, initially release chemical gases into the  air . Some studies indicate that this  outgassing  of additives may contribute to health complications, and have resulted in a call for banning the use of DEHP on shower curtains, among other uses. [ 16 ]  The Japanese car companies  Toyota ,  Nissan , and  Honda  have eliminated PVC in their car interiors starting in 2007.   In 2004, a joint Swedish-Danish research team found a statistical association between allergies in children and indoor air levels of DEHP and BBzP ( butyl benzyl phthalate ), which is used in vinyl flooring. [ 17 ]  In December 2006, the European Chemicals Bureau of the European Commission released a final draft risk assessment of BBzP which found ""no concern"" for consumer exposure including exposure to children. [ 18 ]   In November 2005, one of the largest hospital networks in the U.S.,  Catholic Healthcare West , signed a contract with B.Braun for vinyl-free  intravenous  bags and tubing. [ 19 ]  According to the  Center for Health, Environment & Justice  in  Falls Church, VA , which helps to coordinate a ""precautionary"" ""  PVC Campaign "", several major corporations including  Microsoft ,  Wal-Mart , and  Kaiser Permanente   announced efforts to eliminate PVC  from products and packaging in 2005. Even Target is reducing its sale of items with PVC. ( http://besafenet.com/pvc/newsreleases/target_to_reduce_use.htm )   The FDA Paper titled ""Safety Assessment of Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP)Released from PVC Medical Devices"" states that [3.2.1.3] Critically ill or injured patients may be at increased risk of developing adverse health effects from DEHP, not only by virtue of increased exposure, relative to the general population, but also because of the physiological and pharmacodynamic changes that occur in these patients, compared to healthy individuals. [ 20 ]   In 2008, The European Union's Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) reviewed the safety of DEHP in medical devices.  The SCENIHR report  states that certain medical procedures used in high risk patients result in a significant exposure to DEHP and concludes there is still a reason for having some concerns about the exposure of prematurely born male babies to medical devices containing DEHP. The Committee said there are some alternative plasticisers available for which there is sufficient toxicological data to indicate a lower hazard compared to DEHP but added that the functionality of these plasticisers should be assessed before they can be used as an alternative for DEHP in PVC medical devices.       Vinyl chloride monomer   In the early 1970s, Dr. John Creech and Dr. Maurice Johnson were the first to clearly link and recognize the carcinogenicity of  vinyl chloride  monomer to humans when workers in the polyvinyl chloride polymerization section of a B.F. Goodrich plant near Louisville, Kentucky, were diagnosed with liver  angiosarcoma  also known as  hemangiosarcoma , a rare disease. [ 21 ]  Since that time, studies of PVC workers in Australia, Italy, Germany, and the UK have all associated certain types of occupational cancers with exposure to vinyl chloride. The link between angiosarcoma of the liver and long-term exposure to vinyl chloride is the only one that has been confirmed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. All the cases of angiosarcoma developed from exposure to vinyl chloride monomer, were in workers who were exposed to very high VCM levels, routinely, for many years. These workers cleaned accretions in reactors, a practice that has now been replaced by automated high pressure water jets.   A 1997 U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report concluded that the development and acceptance by the PVC industry of a closed loop polymerization process in the late 1970s ""almost completely eliminated worker exposures"" and that ""new cases of hepatic angiosarcoma in vinyl chloride polymerization workers have been virtually eliminated."" [ 22 ]   According to the EPA, ""vinyl chloride emissions from polyvinyl chloride (PVC),  ethylene dichloride  (EDC), and  vinyl chloride  monomer (VCM) plants cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to result in an increase in mortality or an increase in serious irreversible, or incapacitating reversible illness. Vinyl chloride is a known human carcinogen that causes a rare cancer of the liver."" [ 23 ]  EPA's 2001 updated Toxicological Profile and Summary Health Assessment for VCM in its Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) database lowers EPA's previous risk factor estimate by a factor of 20 and concludes that ""because of the consistent evidence for liver cancer in all the studies...and the weaker association for other sites, it is concluded that the liver is the most sensitive site, and protection against liver cancer will protect against possible cancer induction in other tissues."" [ 24 ]   A 1998 front-page series in the  Houston Chronicle  claimed the vinyl industry has manipulated vinyl chloride studies to avoid liability for worker exposure and to hide extensive and severe chemical spills into local communities. [ 25 ]  Retesting of community residents in 2001 by the U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) found dioxin levels similar to those in a comparison community in Louisiana and to the U.S. population. [ 26 ]  Cancer rates in the community were similar to Louisiana and US averages. [ 27 ]       Dioxins   The environmentalist group  Greenpeace  has advocated the global phase-out of PVC because they claim  dioxin  is produced as a byproduct of  vinyl chloride  manufacture and from incineration of waste PVC in domestic garbage. The European Industry, however, asserts [ citation needed ]  that it has improved production processes to minimize dioxin emissions.   Also, scientific tests wherein municipal refuse containing several known concentrations of PVC was burned in a commercial-scale incinerator showed no relationship between the PVC content of the waste and dioxin emissions.

[ 1 ]              Polyvinyl chloride       Polyvinyl chloride , ( IUPAC  Poly(chloroethanediyl)) commonly abbreviated  PVC , is the third most widely used  thermoplastic   polymer  after  polyethylene  and  polypropylene . In terms of  revenue  generated, it is one of the most valuable products of the  chemical industry . Around the world, over 50% of PVC manufactured is used in construction. As a building material, PVC is cheap, durable, and easy to assemble. The PVC world market grew with an average rate of approximately 5% in the last years and will probably reach a volume of 40 million tons by the year 2016.   It can be made softer and more flexible by the addition of  plasticizers , the most widely-used being  phthalates . In this form, it is used in  clothing  and  upholstery , and to make flexible  hoses  and tubing,  flooring , to roofing membranes, and electrical cable insulation. It is also commonly used in figurines and in inflatable products such as  waterbeds ,  pool  toys or jump houses.

Since about 57% of its mass is  chlorine , creating a given mass of PVC requires less  petroleum  than many other polymers. [ citation needed ]         By far the most widely used production process is suspension polymerization. In this process, VCM and water are introduced into the polymerization reactor and a polymerization initiator, along with other chemical additives, are added to initiate the polymerization reaction. The contents of the reaction vessel are continually mixed to maintain the suspension and ensure a uniform particle size of the PVC resin. The reaction is  exothermic , and thus requires a cooling mechanism to maintain the reactor contents at the appropriate temperature. As the volumes also contract during the reaction (PVC is denser than VCM), water is continually added to the mixture to maintain the suspension.   Once the reaction has run its course, the resulting PVC slurry is degassed and stripped to remove excess VCM (which is recycled into the next batch) then passed though a centrifuge to remove most of the excess water. The slurry is then dried further in a hot air bed and the resulting powder sieved before storage or pelletization. In normal operations, the resulting PVC has a VCM content of less than 1  part per million .   Other production processes, such as micro-suspension polymerization and emulsion polymerization, produce PVC with smaller particle sizes (10m vs 120-150m for suspension PVC) with slightly different properties and with somewhat different sets of applications.     [ edit ]   History   Polyvinyl chloride was accidentally discovered on at least two different occasions in the 19th century, first in 1835 by  Henri Victor Regnault  and in 1872 by  Eugen Baumann . On both occasions, the  polymer  appeared as a white solid inside flasks of  vinyl chloride  that had been left exposed to sunlight. In the early 20th century, the Russian chemist  Ivan Ostromislensky  and  Fritz Klatte  of the German chemical company  Griesheim-Elektron  both attempted to use PVC (polyvinyl chloride) in commercial products, but difficulties in processing the rigid, sometimes brittle polymer blocked their efforts. In 1926,  Waldo Semon  and the  B.F. Goodrich  Company developed a method to  plasticize  PVC by blending it with various additives. The result was a more flexible and more easily-processed material that soon achieved widespread commercial use.     [ edit ]   Applications   PVC's intrinsic properties make it suitable for a wide variety of applications. It is biologically and chemically resistant, making it the plastic of choice for most household sewerage pipes and other pipe applications where corrosion would limit the use of metal.   With the addition of impact modifiers and stabilizers, it becomes a popular material for window and door frames. By adding plasticizers, it can become flexible enough to be used in cabling applications as a wire insulator.     [ edit ]   Clothing   PVC has become widely used in clothing either create a leather like material or at times simply for the effect of PVC. PVC clothing is common in Goth, Punk and other alternative fashions as well as in Fetish wear. PVC is cheaper than rubber, leather or latex and so it is more widely available and worn.   PVC fabric has a sheen to it and is waterproof. It is commonly used in coats, jackets, aprons and bags because of this.     [ edit ]   Electric wires   PVC is commonly used as the insulation on electric wires; the plastic used for this purpose needs to be  plasticized .   In a fire, PVC-coated wires can form  HCl  fumes; the chlorine serves to scavenge  free radicals  and is the source of the material's  fire retardance . While HCl fumes can also pose a health hazard in their own right, HCl dissolves in moisture and breaks down onto surfaces, particularly in areas where the air is cool enough to breathe, and is not available for inhalation. [ 2 ]  Frequently in applications where smoke is a major hazard (notably in tunnels) PVC-free  LSOH  (low-smoke, zero- halogen ) cable insulation is preferred.     [ edit ]   Pipes          PVC  pipes  in use with  intumescent   firestops  at Nortown Casitas,  North York, Ontario .       Polyvinyl chloride is also widely used for producing some forms of pipes. In the water distribution market it accounts for 66 percent of the market in the US, and in sanitary sewer pipe applications, it accounts for 75 percent. [ 3 ]  Its light weight, high strength, and low reactivity make it particularly well-suited to this purpose. In addition, PVC pipes can be fused together using various solvent cements, creating permanent joints that are virtually impervious to leakage. Despite PVC's many advantages, in cases where very high strength or ease of disassembly is necessary, metal pipes are still preferred.   In February 2007, the California Building Standards Code was updated to approve the use of  chlorinated polyvinyl chloride  (CPVC) pipe for use in residential water supply piping systems. CPVC has been a nationally-accepted material in the US since 1982; however, California has only permitted its use on a limited basis since 2001. The Department of Housing and Community Development prepared and certified an Environmental Impact Report resulting in a recommendation that the Commission adopt and approve the use of CPVC. The Commission's vote was unanimous and CPVC has been placed in the 2007 California Plumbing Code. [ 4 ]   In the United States and Canada, PVC pipes account for the largest majority of pipe materials used in buried municipal applications for drinking water distribution and wastewater mains. A detailed State-of-the-Art review of PVC pipes in North America can be found in an article titled Thermoplastics at Work: A Comprehensive Review of Municipal PVC Piping Products. [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Portable Electronic Accessories   PVC is finding increased use as a composite for the production of accessories or housings for portable electronics. Through a fusing process, it can adopt cleaning properties possessed by materials such as wool or cotton which can absorb dust particles and bacteria. Its inherent ability to absorb particles from the LCD screen and its form fitting characteristics make it effective. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Signs   In flat sheet form, polyvinyl chloride is formed in a variety of thicknesses and colors. As flat sheets, PVC is often expanded to create voids in the interior of the material, providing additional thickness without additional weight and cost. Sheets are cut using saw and rotary cutting equipment. Plasticized PVC is also used to produce thin, colored, or clear, adhesive-backed films referred to simply as vinyl. These films are typically cut on a computer-controlled  plotter  or printed in a  wide-format printer . These sheets and films are used to produce a wide variety of  commercial signage  products and markings on vehicles.     [ edit ]   Unplasticized polyvinyl chloride (uPVC)          Modern "" Tudorbethan "" house with uPVC gutters and downpipes, fascia, decorative imitation "" half-timbering "", windows, and doors       uPVC or Rigid PVC is often used in the building industry as a low-maintenance material, particularly in the  UK , and in the  United States  where it is known as vinyl, or  vinyl siding . [ 6 ] [ 7 ]  The material comes in a range of colors and finishes, including a photo-effect wood finish, and is used as a substitute for painted wood, mostly for  window frames  and  sills  when installing  double glazing  in new buildings, or to replace older single glazed windows. It has many other uses including  fascia , and  siding  or  weatherboarding . The same material has almost entirely replaced the use of  cast iron  for  plumbing  and  drainage , being used for waste pipes, drainpipes,  gutters  and downpipes. [ 8 ]   Due to  environmental concerns  use of PVC is discouraged by some local authorities in countries such as  Germany  and  The Netherlands . [ 9 ] [ 10 ]  This concerns both flexible PVC and rigid uPVC as not only the plasticizers in PVC are seen as a problem but also the emissions from manufacturing and disposal. The use of modern impact modifiers offer great stability. The issues of migration and brittleness of the PVC compound are overcome. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Health and safety     [ edit ]   Phthalate plasticizers   Many vinyl products contain additional chemicals to change the chemical consistency of the product. Some of these additional chemicals called additives can leach out of vinyl products.  Plasticizers  that must be added to make PVC flexible have been an additive of particular concern.   Because soft PVC toys have been made for babies for years, there are concerns that these additives leach out of soft toys into the mouths of the children chewing on them. Additionally, adult  sex toys  have been demonstrated to contain high concentrations of the additives. [ 11 ]  In January 2006, the European Union placed a ban on six types of phthalate softeners, including DEHP ( diethylhexyl phthalate ), used in toys. [ 12 ]  In the U.S. most companies have voluntarily stopped manufacturing PVC toys with DEHP and in 2003 the US Consumer Product Safety Commission ( CPSC ) denied a petition for a ban on PVC toys made with an alternative plasticizer, DINP ( diisononyl phthalate ). [ 13 ]  In April 2006, the  European Chemicals Bureau  of the  European Commission  published an assessment of DINP which found risk ""unlikely"" for children and newborns. [ 14 ]   Vinyl  IV  bags used in neo-natal  intensive care  units have also been shown to leach DEHP. In a draft guidance paper published in September 2002, the US FDA recognizes that many medical devices with PVC containing DEHP are not used in ways that result in significant human exposure to the chemical. [1]  However, FDA is suggesting that manufacturers consider eliminating the use of DEHP in certain devices that can result in high aggregate exposures for sensitive patient populations such as neonates.   Other vinyl products, including car interiors, shower curtains, flooring, initially release chemical gases into the  air . Some studies indicate that this  outgassing  of additives may contribute to health complications, and have resulted in a call for banning the use of DEHP on shower curtains, among other uses. [ 15 ]  The Japanese car companies  Toyota ,  Nissan , and  Honda  have eliminated PVC in their car interiors starting in 2007.   In 2004, a joint Swedish-Danish research team found a statistical association between allergies in children and indoor air levels of DEHP and BBzP ( butyl benzyl phthalate ), which is used in vinyl flooring. [ 16 ]  In December 2006, the European Chemicals Bureau of the European Commission released a final draft risk assessment of BBzP which found ""no concern"" for consumer exposure including exposure to children. [ 17 ]   In November 2005, one of the largest hospital networks in the U.S.,  Catholic Healthcare West , signed a contract with  B.Braun  for vinyl-free  intravenous  bags and tubing. [ 18 ]  According to the  Center for Health, Environment & Justice  in  Falls Church, VA , which helps to coordinate a ""precautionary"" ""  PVC Campaign "", several major corporations including  Microsoft ,  Wal-Mart , and  Kaiser Permanente   announced efforts to eliminate PVC  from products and packaging in 2005. Even Target is reducing its sale of items with PVC. ( http://besafenet.com/pvc/newsreleases/target_to_reduce_use.htm )   The FDA Paper titled ""Safety Assessment of Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP)Released from PVC Medical Devices"" states that [3.2.1.3] Critically ill or injured patients may be at increased risk of developing adverse health effects from DEHP, not only by virtue of increased exposure, relative to the general population, but also because of the physiological and pharmacodynamic changes that occur in these patients, compared to healthy individuals. [ 19 ]   In 2008, The European Union's Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) reviewed the safety of DEHP in medical devices.  The SCENIHR report  states that certain medical procedures used in high risk patients result in a significant exposure to DEHP and concludes there is still a reason for having some concerns about the exposure of prematurely born male babies to medical devices containing DEHP. The Committee said there are some alternative plasticisers available for which there is sufficient toxicological data to indicate a lower hazard compared to DEHP but added that the functionality of these plasticisers should be assessed before they can be used as an alternative for DEHP in PVC medical devices.     [ edit ]   Vinyl chloride monomer   In the early 1970s, Dr. John Creech and Dr. Maurice Johnson were the first to clearly link and recognize the carcinogenicity of  vinyl chloride  monomer to humans when workers in the polyvinyl chloride polymerization section of a B.F. Goodrich plant near Louisville, Kentucky, were diagnosed with liver  angiosarcoma  also known as  hemangiosarcoma , a rare disease. [ 20 ]  Since that time, studies of PVC workers in Australia, Italy, Germany, and the UK have all associated certain types of occupational cancers with exposure to vinyl chloride. The link between angiosarcoma of the liver and long-term exposure to vinyl chloride is the only one that has been confirmed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. All the cases of angiosarcoma developed from exposure to vinyl chloride monomer, were in workers who were exposed to very high VCM levels, routinely, for many years. These workers cleaned accretions in reactors, a practice that has now been replaced by automated high pressure water jets.   A 1997 U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report concluded that the development and acceptance by the PVC industry of a closed loop polymerization process in the late 1970s ""almost completely eliminated worker exposures"" and that ""new cases of hepatic angiosarcoma in vinyl chloride polymerization workers have been virtually eliminated."" [ 21 ]   According to the EPA, ""vinyl chloride emissions from polyvinyl chloride (PVC),  ethylene dichloride  (EDC), and  vinyl chloride  monomer (VCM) plants cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to result in an increase in mortality or an increase in serious irreversible, or incapacitating reversible illness. Vinyl chloride is a known human carcinogen that causes a rare cancer of the liver."" [ 22 ]  EPA's 2001 updated Toxicological Profile and Summary Health Assessment for VCM in its Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) database lowers EPA's previous risk factor estimate by a factor of 20 and concludes that ""because of the consistent evidence for liver cancer in all the studies...and the weaker association for other sites, it is concluded that the liver is the most sensitive site, and protection against liver cancer will protect against possible  cancer induction  in other tissues."" [ 23 ]   A 1998 front-page series in the  Houston Chronicle  claimed the vinyl industry has manipulated vinyl chloride studies to avoid liability for worker exposure and to hide extensive and severe chemical spills into local communities. [ 24 ]  Retesting of community residents in 2001 by the U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) found dioxin levels similar to those in a comparison community in Louisiana and to the U.S. population. [ 25 ]  Cancer rates in the community were similar to Louisiana and US averages. [ 26 ]     [ edit ]   Dioxins   The environmentalist group  Greenpeace  has advocated the global phase-out of PVC because they claim  dioxin  is produced as a byproduct of  vinyl chloride  manufacture and from incineration of waste PVC in domestic garbage. The European Industry, however, asserts [ citation needed ]  that it has improved production processes to minimize dioxin emissions.   Also, scientific tests wherein municipal refuse containing several known concentrations of PVC was burned in a commercial-scale incinerator showed no relationship between the PVC content of the waste and dioxin emissions. [ 27 ]   [ 28 ]   PVC produces HCl upon combustion almost quantitatively related to its chlorine content. Extensive studies in Europe indicate that the chlorine found in emitted dioxins is not derived from HCl in the flue gases. Instead, most dioxins arise in the condensed solid phase by the reaction of inorganic chlorides with graphitic structures in char-containing ash particles. Copper acts as a catalyst for these reactions. [ 29 ]   Dioxins are a global health threat because they persist in the environment and can travel long distances. At very low levels, near those to which the general population is exposed, dioxins have been linked [ citation needed ]  to immune system suppression, reproductive disorders, a variety of cancers, and  endometriosis . According to a 1994 report by the British firm, ICI Chemicals & Polymers Ltd., ""It has been known since the publication of a paper in 1989 that these oxychlorination reactions [used to make vinyl chloride and some chlorinated solvents] generate polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs) and dibenzofurans (PCDFs). The reactions include all of the ingredients and conditions necessary to form PCDD/PCDFs.... It is difficult to see how any of these conditions could be modified so as to prevent PCDD/PCDF formation without seriously impairing the reaction for which the process is designed."" In other words, dioxins are an undesirable byproduct of producing vinyl chloride and eliminating the production of dioxins while maintaining the oxychlorination reaction may be difficult. Dioxins created by vinyl chloride production are released by on-site incinerators, flares, boilers, wastewater treatment systems and even in trace quantities in vinyl resins. [ 30 ]  The US EPA estimate of dioxin releases from the PVC industry was 13 grams TEQ in 1995, or less than 0.5% of the total dioxin emissions in the US; by 2002, PVC industry dioxin emissions had been further reduced by 23%. [ 31 ]   The largest well-quantified source of dioxin in the US EPA inventory of dioxin sources is barrel burning of household waste. [ 32 ]  Studies of household waste burning indicate consistent increases in dioxin generation with increasing PVC concentrations. [ 33 ]  According to the EPA dioxin inventory,  landfill fires  are likely to represent an even larger source of dioxin to the environment. A survey of international studies consistently identifies high dioxin concentrations in areas affected by open waste burning and a study that looked at the homologue pattern found the sample with the highest dioxin concentration was ""typical for the pyrolysis of PVC"". Other EU studies indicate that PVC likely ""accounts for the overwhelming majority of chlorine that is available for dioxin formation during landfill fires."" [ 34 ]   The next largest sources of dioxin in the EPA inventory are medical and municipal waste incinerators. [ 35 ]  Studies have shown a clear correlation between dioxin formation and chloride content and indicate that PVC is a significant contributor to the formation of both dioxin and PCB in incinerators. [ 36 ]   In February 2007, the Technical and Scientific Advisory Committee of the US Green Building Council (USGBC) released its report on a PVC avoidance related materials credit for the LEED Green Building Rating system. The report concludes that ""no single material shows up as the best across all the human health and environmental impact categories, nor as the worst"" but that the ""risk of dioxin emissions puts PVC consistently among the worst materials for human health impacts.""  [ 37 ]     [ edit ]   Bans   The State of California is currently considering a bill that would ban the use of PVC in consumer packaging due to the threats it poses to human and environmental health and its effect on the recycling stream. [ 38 ]  Specifically, the language of the bill analysis [ 39 ]  stipulates that EPA has listed PVC as a carcinogen. It is also further cites that there are concerns about the leaching of phthalates and lead from the PVC packaging.     [ edit ]   Recycling   The symbol, or ' SPI code ', for polyvinyl chloride developed by the  Society of the Plastics Industry  so that items can be labeled for easy recycling is:    The  Unicode  character for this symbol is U+2675 (HTML  character reference  &#9845;).   Post-consumer PVC is not typically recycled due to the prohibitive cost of regrinding and recompounding the resin compared to the cost of virgin (unrecycled) resin. [ citation needed ]   Some PVC manufacturers have placed vinyl recycling programs into action, recycling both manufacturing waste back into their products, as well as post consumer PVC construction materials to reduce the load on landfills. [ citation needed ]   The  thermal depolymerization  process can safely and efficiently convert PVC into fuel and minerals, according to the company that developed it. It is not yet in widespread use.   A new process of  PVC recycling  is being developed in Europe called Texiloop. [ 40 ]  This process is based on a technology already applied industrially in Europe and Japan, called Vinyloop, which consists of recovering PVC plastic from composite materials through dissolution and precipitation. It strives to be a closed loop system, recycling its key solvent and hopefully making PVC a future  technical nutrient .

clueweb09-en0010-45-14729	"         Poly(vinyl chloride) is the  plastic  known at the hardware store as PVC. The plumbing in your house is probably PVC pipe, unless it's an older house.  PVC pipe is what rural high schools with small budgets use to make goal posts for their football fields. But there's more to PVC than just pipe.  The ""vinyl"" siding used on houses is made of poly(vinyl chloride).  Inside the house, PVC is used to make linoleum for the floor.          PVC is useful because it resists two things that hate each other: fire and water.  Because of it's water resistance it is used to make raincoats and shower curtains, and of course, water pipes.  It has flame resistance, too, because it contains chlorine.  When you try to burn PVC, chlorine atoms are released, and chlorine atoms inhibit combustion.  See the big green chlorine atoms in the 3-D model?         Structurally, PVC is a vinyl polymer, similar to  polyethylene , but on every other carbon in the backbone chain, one of the hydrogen atoms is replaced with a chlorine atom. You can see the monomer on the left.           PVC was one of those odd discoveries that actually had to be made twice. It seems around a hundred years ago, a few German business guys decided they were going to make loads of cash lighting people's homes with lamps fueled by acetylene gas.  Wouldn't you know it, right about the time they had produced tons of acetylene to sell to everyone who was going to buy their lamps, new efficient electric generators were developed which made the price of electric lighting drop so low that the acetylene lamp business was finished. That left a lot of acetylene lying around.           So in 1912 one German chemist, Fritz Klatte decided to try to do something with it, and reacted some acetylene with hydrochloric acid (HCl).  Now this reaction will produce vinyl chloride, but at that time no one knew what to do with it, so he put it on the shelf, where it polymerized over time.  Not knowing what to do with the PVC he had just invented, he told his bosses at his company, Greisheim Electron, who had the material patented in Germany.  They never figured out a use for PVC, and in 1925 their patent expired.      Wouldn't you know it, in 1926 the very next year, and American chemist, Waldo Semon was working at B.F. Goodrich when he independently invented PVC.  But unlike the earlier chemists, it dawned on him that this new material would make a perfect shower curtain.  He and his bosses at B.F. Goodrich patented PVC in the United States (Klatte's bosses apparently never filed for a patent outside Germany).  Tons of new uses for this wonderful waterproof material followed, and PVC was a smash hit the second time around.     Other polymers used as  plastics  include:      Polyethylene   Polypropylene   Polycarbonate   Polystyrene   Polyesters   Nylon   Poly(methyl methacrylate)            Sources:      Burke, James;  Connections , Little, Brown and Co., Boston, 1978.

Many Jax products are considered hazardous under 49 CFR  (Jax Products that are considered hazardous are denoted with an asterisk).           UPS charges $20 for each package containing hazardous materials, regardless of quantity, in addition to the normal UPS shipping rate. Therefore, the hazardous material charge is the same for one pint and one 5-gallon container. Larger orders may be shipped by a common carrier of the customer's choice. Hazardous materials cannot be shipped by the United States Postal Service and cannot be shipped to a post office box.

Many Jax products are considered hazardous under 49 CFR  (Jax Products that are considered hazardous are denoted with an asterisk).           UPS charges $20 for each package containing hazardous materials, regardless of quantity, in addition to the normal UPS shipping rate. Therefore, the hazardous material charge is the same for one pint and one 5-gallon container. Larger orders may be shipped by a common carrier of the customer's choice. Hazardous materials cannot be shipped by the United States Postal Service and cannot be shipped to a post office box.

Our contact info is at   inspect-ny.com/appointment.htm .                     This web page describes use of chemical toilets, how they work, and how they reduce wastewater  consumption. The photograph at page top is of the Thetford PortaPotti, a portable toilet which uses chemicals. Other common portable toilets include models from Sears, the Coleman, and Reliance toilets who provide a hassock model portable chemical toilet.   Chemical toilets with larger waste reservoirs are used in RV's and campers as well as for full-sized portable toilets or Porta-Johns used at construction sites and at outdoor festivals.

Chemical Toilets:  use a chemically treated reservoir located directly below the toilet seat. The chemicals reduce odors and perform partial (incomplete) disinfection of the waste. Chemical toilets have limited storage capacity and must be pumped and periodically cleaned by a septic company. Similar to simple chemical toilets but more sophisticated in design are recirculating toilets which separate the waste from the chemical and then recirculated the fluid through the toilet tank.    The following is from:  New York State Appendix 75-A.10 Other systems     (i) Chemical toilets  provide a toilet seat located directly above a vault containing a chemical to disinfect and remove odors from the wastewater.  Recirculating toilets use chemicals as the toilet flush fluid.  The wastes are separated from the fluid, wastes discharged to an internal holding tank, and the fluid reused.     (ii) The liquids used in these types of toilets do not completely disinfect the wastes; therefore, waste products from these units shall not be discharged to surface waters or to the ground surface.     (iii) The reduced volume wastewater from recirculating toilets may be discharged to a larger holding tank but not to a subsurface absorption system.   So are chemical toilets useful as a septic system design alternative or not?   While at least some manufacturers of the chemicals used in chemical toilets (to deodorize and to stop bacterial action in order to prevent dangerous production of potentially explosive methane gas inside the toilet) inform us that their products are environmentally friendly, New York State, as an example, does not want homeowners discharging chemical toilets into the environment. Further, as we have advised elsewhere about dumping RV toilets into the septic system, there is some risk that discharging these chemicals into a conventional septic system could cause it to stop working, depending on the frequency and volume of chemical waste to be disposed-of.   With this in mind, we use chemical toilets where there is  no onsite waste disposal system at all  such as in a weekend cabin without plumbing, or in RV's, but not as a permanent toilet facility in a permanently occupied building.  Chemical toilets are suitable for the ""pack it in, pack it out"" environment in which waste is removed from the site and dumped at an approved RV dumping facility.   Is it acceptable to ever dump an RV toilet into a home septic system tank?     The answer is, ... it depends.    See our detailed article explaining when it is probably ok and when it is probably not ok to dump a chemical toilet, a porta-potty, or an RV waste holding tank into a septic tank (rather than dumping these at a sanitary waste disposal station, for example, at a campground or marina).

Material reinforcement is uniformly placed in stress concentration areas for substantially improved    pressure handling capability. Resulting products are subjected to numerous verification tests to assure    obtaining the very best  PVC fittings  available.        Full 1/4"" Through 12"" Availability     Spearscomprehensive line of  injection molded PVC fittings  offers a variety of configurations in molded     Schedule 80 sizes 1/4"" through 12"" conforming to ASTM D 2467 and Spearsexclusive CL150 Flanges in sizes     1/2"" through 16"".          Higher Flow Capacity     Smooth interior walls result in lower pressure loss and higher volume than conventional metal fittings.               Exceptional Chemical & Corrosion Resistance     Unlike metal,  PVC fittings  never rust, scale, or pit, and will provide many years of maintenance-free     service and extended system life.          Additional Fabricated Configurations through 36""     Extra large, hard-to-find, and custom configurations are fabricated from NSF Certified pipe.     Fittings are engineered and tested to provide full pressure handling capabilities according to Spearsspecifications.          High Temperature Ratings     PVC thermoplastic can handle fluids at service temperatures up to 140F (60), allowing a wide     range of process applications, including corrosive fluids.

[ citation needed ]  In terms of  revenue  generated, it is one of the most valuable products of the  chemical industry . Around the world, over 50% of PVC manufactured is used in construction. As a building material, PVC is cheap, durable, and easy to assemble. The PVC world market grew with an average rate of approximately 5% in the last years and will probably reach a volume of 40 million tons by the year 2016.   It can be made softer and more flexible by the addition of  plasticizers , the most widely-used being  phthalates . In this form, it is used in  clothing  and  upholstery , and to make flexible  hoses  and tubing,  flooring , to roofing membranes, and electrical cable insulation. It is also commonly used in figurines and in inflatable products such as  waterbeds ,  pool  toys or jump houses.

Since about 57% of its mass is  chlorine , creating a given mass of PVC requires less  petroleum  than many other polymers. [ citation needed ]         By far the most widely used production process is suspension polymerization. In this process, VCM and water are introduced into the polymerization reactor and a polymerization initiator, along with other chemical additives, are added to initiate the polymerization reaction. The contents of the reaction vessel are continually mixed to maintain the suspension and ensure a uniform particle size of the PVC resin. The reaction is  exothermic , and thus requires a cooling mechanism to maintain the reactor contents at the appropriate temperature. As the volumes also contract during the reaction (PVC is denser than VCM), water is continually added to the mixture to maintain the suspension.   Once the reaction has run its course, the resulting PVC slurry is degassed and stripped to remove excess VCM (which is recycled into the next batch) then passed though a centrifuge to remove most of the excess water. The slurry is then dried further in a hot air bed and the resulting powder sieved before storage or pelletization. In normal operations, the resulting PVC has a VCM content of less than 1  part per million .   Other production processes, such as micro-suspension polymerization and emulsion polymerization, produce PVC with smaller particle sizes (10m vs 120-150m for suspension PVC) with slightly different properties and with somewhat different sets of applications.     [ edit ]   History   Polyvinyl chloride was accidentally discovered on at least two different occasions in the 19th century, first in 1835 by  Henri Victor Regnault  and in 1872 by  Eugen Baumann . On both occasions, the  polymer  appeared as a white solid inside flasks of  vinyl chloride  that had been left exposed to sunlight. In the early 20th century, the Russian chemist  Ivan Ostromislensky  and  Fritz Klatte  of the German chemical company  Griesheim-Elektron  both attempted to use PVC (polyvinyl chloride) in commercial products, but difficulties in processing the rigid, sometimes brittle polymer blocked their efforts. In 1926,  Waldo Semon  and the  B.F. Goodrich  Company developed a method to  plasticize  PVC by blending it with various additives. The result was a more flexible and more easily-processed material that soon achieved widespread commercial use.     [ edit ]   Applications   PVC's intrinsic properties make it suitable for a wide variety of applications. It is biologically and chemically resistant, making it the  plastic  of choice for most household  sewerage pipes  and other pipe applications where  corrosion  would limit the use of  metal .   With the addition of impact modifiers and stabilizers, it becomes a popular material for  window  and  door  frames. By adding  plasticizers , it can become flexible enough to be used in cabling applications as a  wire  insulator.     [ edit ]   Clothing   PVC has become widely used in  clothing  either create a  leather  like material or at times simply for the effect of  PVC . PVC clothing is common in  Goth ,  Punk  and other  alternative fashions  as well as in  Fetish wear . PVC is cheaper than  rubber , leather or  latex  and so it is more widely available and worn.   PVC fabric has a sheen to it and is  waterproof . It is commonly used in coats,  jackets ,  aprons  and bags because of this.     [ edit ]   Electric wires   PVC is commonly used as the  insulation  on  electric wires ; the plastic used for this purpose needs to be  plasticized .   In a  fire , PVC-coated wires can form  HCl  fumes; the chlorine serves to scavenge  free radicals  and is the source of the material's  fire retardance . While HCl fumes can also pose a  health hazard  in their own right, HCl dissolves in moisture and breaks down onto surfaces, particularly in areas where the air is cool enough to breathe, and is not available for inhalation. [ 3 ]  Frequently in applications where smoke is a major hazard (notably in tunnels) PVC-free  LSOH  (low-smoke, zero- halogen ) cable insulation is preferred.     [ edit ]   Pipes          PVC  pipes  in use with  intumescent   firestops  at Nortown Casitas,  North York, Ontario .       Roughly half of the world's polyvinyl chloride resin manufactured annually is used for producing pipes for various municipal and industrial applications. [ 4 ]  In the water distribution market it accounts for 66 percent of the market in the US, and in sanitary sewer pipe applications, it accounts for 75 percent. [ 5 ]  Its light weight, high strength, and low reactivity make it particularly well-suited to this purpose. In addition, PVC pipes can be fused together using various solvent cements, or heat-fused (butt-fusion process, similar to joining  HDPE  pipe), creating permanent joints that are virtually impervious to leakage.   In February  2007 , the California Building Standards Code was updated to approve the use of  chlorinated polyvinyl chloride  (CPVC) pipe for use in residential  water supply  piping systems. CPVC has been a nationally-accepted material in the US since  1982 ; however,  California  has only permitted its use on a limited basis since  2001 . The Department of Housing and Community Development prepared and certified an  Environmental Impact Report  resulting in a recommendation that the Commission adopt and approve the use of CPVC. The Commission's vote was unanimous and CPVC has been placed in the 2007 California Plumbing Code. [ 6 ]   In the  United States  and  Canada , PVC pipes account for the largest majority of pipe materials used in buried municipal applications for  drinking water  distribution and  wastewater  mains. A detailed State-of-the-Art review of PVC pipes in North America can be found in an article titled Thermoplastics at Work: A Comprehensive Review of Municipal PVC Piping Products. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Portable Electronic Accessories   PVC is finding increased use as a composite for the production of accessories or housings for portable electronics. Through a fusing process, it can adopt cleaning properties possessed by materials such as  wool  or  cotton  which can absorb  dust  particles and  bacteria . Its inherent ability to absorb particles from the  LCD  screen and its form fitting characteristics make it effective. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Signs   In flat sheet form, polyvinyl chloride is formed in a variety of thicknesses and colors. As flat sheets, PVC is often expanded to create voids in the interior of the material, providing additional thickness without additional weight and cost. Sheets are cut using  saw  and rotary cutting equipment. Plasticized PVC is also used to produce thin, colored, or clear,  adhesive -backed films referred to simply as vinyl. These films are typically cut on a  computer -controlled  plotter  or printed in a  wide-format printer . These sheets and films are used to produce a wide variety of  commercial signage  products and markings on vehicles.     [ edit ]   Unplasticized polyvinyl chloride (uPVC)          Modern "" Tudorbethan "" house with uPVC gutters and downpipes,  fascia , decorative imitation "" half-timbering "", windows, and doors       uPVC or Rigid PVC is often used in the building industry as a low-maintenance material, particularly in  Ireland  and the  UK , and in the  United States  where it is known as vinyl, or  vinyl siding . [ 8 ] [ 9 ]  The material comes in a range of colors and finishes, including a photo-effect wood finish, and is used as a substitute for painted wood, mostly for  window frames  and  sills  when installing  double glazing  in new buildings, or to replace older single glazed windows. It has many other uses including  fascia , and  siding  or  weatherboarding . The same material has almost entirely replaced the use of  cast iron  for  plumbing  and  drainage , being used for waste pipes, drainpipes,  gutters  and downpipes. [ 10 ]   Due to  environmental concerns  use of PVC is discouraged by some local authorities in countries such as  Germany  and  The Netherlands . [ 11 ] [ 12 ]  This concerns both flexible PVC and rigid uPVC as not only the plasticizers in PVC are seen as a problem but also the emissions from manufacturing and disposal. The use of modern impact modifiers offer great stability. The issues of migration and brittleness of the PVC compound are overcome. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Health and safety     [ edit ]   Phthalate plasticizers   Many vinyl products contain additional chemicals to change the chemical consistency of the product. Some of these additional chemicals called additives can leach out of vinyl products.  Plasticizers  that must be added to make PVC flexible have been an additive of particular concern.   Because soft PVC toys have been made for babies for years, there are concerns that these additives leach out of soft toys into the mouths of the children chewing on them. Additionally, adult  sex toys  have been demonstrated to contain high concentrations of the additives. [ 13 ]  In January 2006, the European Union placed a ban on six types of phthalate softeners, including DEHP ( diethylhexyl phthalate ), used in toys. [ 14 ]  In the U.S. most companies have voluntarily stopped manufacturing PVC toys with DEHP and in 2003 the US Consumer Product Safety Commission ( CPSC ) denied a petition for a ban on PVC toys made with an alternative plasticizer, DINP ( diisononyl phthalate ). [ 15 ]  In April 2006, the  European Chemicals Bureau  of the  European Commission  published an assessment of DINP which found risk ""unlikely"" for children and newborns. [ 16 ]   Vinyl  IV  bags used in neo-natal  intensive care  units have also been shown to leach DEHP. In a draft guidance paper published in September 2002, the US FDA recognizes that many medical devices with PVC containing DEHP are not used in ways that result in significant human exposure to the chemical. [1]  However, FDA is suggesting that manufacturers consider eliminating the use of DEHP in certain devices that can result in high aggregate exposures for sensitive patient populations such as neonates.   Other vinyl products, including car interiors, shower curtains, flooring, initially release chemical gases into the  air . Some studies indicate that this  outgassing  of additives may contribute to health complications, and have resulted in a call for banning the use of DEHP on shower curtains, among other uses. [ 17 ]  The Japanese car companies  Toyota ,  Nissan , and  Honda  have eliminated PVC in their car interiors starting in 2007.   In 2004, a joint Swedish-Danish research team found a statistical association between allergies in children and indoor air levels of DEHP and BBzP ( butyl benzyl phthalate ), which is used in vinyl flooring. [ 18 ]  In December 2006, the European Chemicals Bureau of the European Commission released a final draft risk assessment of BBzP which found ""no concern"" for consumer exposure including exposure to children. [ 19 ]   In November 2005, one of the largest hospital networks in the U.S.,  Catholic Healthcare West , signed a contract with  B.Braun  for vinyl-free  intravenous  bags and tubing. [ 20 ]  According to the  Center for Health, Environment & Justice  in  Falls Church, VA , which helps to coordinate a ""precautionary"" ""  PVC Campaign "", several major corporations including  Microsoft ,  Wal-Mart , and  Kaiser Permanente   announced efforts to eliminate PVC  from products and packaging in 2005. Even Target is reducing its sale of items with PVC. ( http://besafenet.com/pvc/newsreleases/target_to_reduce_use.htm )   The FDA Paper titled ""Safety Assessment of Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP)Released from PVC Medical Devices"" states that [3.2.1.3] Critically ill or injured patients may be at increased risk of developing adverse health effects from DEHP, not only by virtue of increased exposure, relative to the general population, but also because of the physiological and pharmacodynamic changes that occur in these patients, compared to healthy individuals. [ 21 ]   In 2008, The European Union's Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) reviewed the safety of DEHP in medical devices.  The SCENIHR report  states that certain medical procedures used in high risk patients result in a significant exposure to DEHP and concludes there is still a reason for having some concerns about the exposure of prematurely born male babies to medical devices containing DEHP. The Committee said there are some alternative plasticisers available for which there is sufficient toxicological data to indicate a lower hazard compared to DEHP but added that the functionality of these plasticisers should be assessed before they can be used as an alternative for DEHP in PVC medical devices.     [ edit ]   Vinyl chloride monomer   In the early 1970s, Dr. John Creech and Dr. Maurice Johnson were the first to clearly link and recognize the carcinogenicity of  vinyl chloride  monomer to humans when workers in the polyvinyl chloride polymerization section of a B.F. Goodrich plant near Louisville, Kentucky, were diagnosed with liver  angiosarcoma  also known as  hemangiosarcoma , a rare disease. [ 22 ]  Since that time, studies of PVC workers in Australia, Italy, Germany, and the UK have all associated certain types of occupational cancers with exposure to vinyl chloride. The link between angiosarcoma of the liver and long-term exposure to vinyl chloride is the only one that has been confirmed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. All the cases of angiosarcoma developed from exposure to vinyl chloride monomer, were in workers who were exposed to very high VCM levels, routinely, for many years. These workers cleaned accretions in reactors, a practice that has now been replaced by automated high pressure water jets.   A 1997 U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report concluded that the development and acceptance by the PVC industry of a closed loop polymerization process in the late 1970s ""almost completely eliminated worker exposures"" and that ""new cases of hepatic angiosarcoma in vinyl chloride polymerization workers have been virtually eliminated."" [ 23 ]   According to the EPA, ""vinyl chloride emissions from polyvinyl chloride (PVC),  ethylene dichloride  (EDC), and  vinyl chloride  monomer (VCM) plants cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to result in an increase in mortality or an increase in serious irreversible, or incapacitating reversible illness. Vinyl chloride is a known human carcinogen that causes a rare cancer of the liver."" [ 24 ]  EPA's 2001 updated Toxicological Profile and Summary Health Assessment for VCM in its Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) database lowers EPA's previous risk factor estimate by a factor of 20 and concludes that ""because of the consistent evidence for liver cancer in all the studies...and the weaker association for other sites, it is concluded that the liver is the most sensitive site, and protection against liver cancer will protect against possible  cancer induction  in other tissues."" [ 25 ]   A 1998 front-page series in the  Houston Chronicle  claimed the vinyl industry has manipulated vinyl chloride studies to avoid liability for worker exposure and to hide extensive and severe chemical spills into local communities. [ 26 ]  Retesting of community residents in 2001 by the U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) found dioxin levels similar to those in a comparison community in Louisiana and to the U.S. population. [ 27 ]  Cancer rates in the community were similar to Louisiana and US averages. [ 28 ]     [ edit ]   Dioxins   The environmentalist group  Greenpeace  has advocated the global phase-out of PVC because they claim  dioxin  is produced as a byproduct of  vinyl chloride  manufacture and from incineration of waste PVC in domestic garbage. The European Industry, however, asserts [ citation needed ]  that it has improved production processes to minimize dioxin emissions.   Also, scientific tests wherein municipal refuse containing several known concentrations of PVC was burned in a commercial-scale incinerator showed no relationship between the PVC content of the waste and dioxin emissions. [ 29 ]   [ 30 ]   PVC produces HCl upon combustion almost quantitatively related to its chlorine content. Extensive studies in Europe indicate that the chlorine found in emitted dioxins is not derived from HCl in the flue gases. Instead, most dioxins arise in the condensed solid phase by the reaction of inorganic chlorides with graphitic structures in char-containing ash particles. Copper acts as a catalyst for these reactions. [ 31 ]   Dioxins are a global health threat because they persist in the environment and can travel long distances. At very low levels, near those to which the general population is exposed, dioxins have been linked [ citation needed ]  to immune system suppression, reproductive disorders, a variety of cancers, and  endometriosis . According to a 1994 report by the British firm, ICI Chemicals & Polymers Ltd., ""It has been known since the publication of a paper in 1989 that these oxychlorination reactions [used to make vinyl chloride and some chlorinated solvents] generate polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs) and dibenzofurans (PCDFs). The reactions include all of the ingredients and conditions necessary to form PCDD/PCDFs.... It is difficult to see how any of these conditions could be modified so as to prevent PCDD/PCDF formation without seriously impairing the reaction for which the process is designed."" In other words, dioxins are an undesirable byproduct of producing vinyl chloride and eliminating the production of dioxins while maintaining the oxychlorination reaction may be difficult. Dioxins created by vinyl chloride production are released by on-site incinerators, flares, boilers, wastewater treatment systems and even in trace quantities in vinyl resins. [ 32 ]  The US EPA estimate of dioxin releases from the PVC industry was 13 grams TEQ in 1995, or less than 0.5% of the total dioxin emissions in the US; by 2002, PVC industry dioxin emissions had been further reduced by 23%. [ 33 ]   The largest well-quantified source of dioxin in the US EPA inventory of dioxin sources is barrel burning of household waste. [ 34 ]  Studies of household waste burning indicate consistent increases in dioxin generation with increasing PVC concentrations. [ 35 ]  According to the EPA dioxin inventory,  landfill fires  are likely to represent an even larger source of dioxin to the environment. A survey of international studies consistently identifies high dioxin concentrations in areas affected by open waste burning and a study that looked at the homologue pattern found the sample with the highest dioxin concentration was ""typical for the pyrolysis of PVC"". Other EU studies indicate that PVC likely ""accounts for the overwhelming majority of chlorine that is available for dioxin formation during landfill fires."" [ 36 ]   The next largest sources of dioxin in the EPA inventory are medical and municipal waste incinerators. [ 37 ]  Studies have shown a clear correlation between dioxin formation and chloride content and indicate that PVC is a significant contributor to the formation of both dioxin and PCB in incinerators. [ 38 ]   In February 2007, the Technical and Scientific Advisory Committee of the US Green Building Council (USGBC) released its report on a PVC avoidance related materials credit for the LEED Green Building Rating system. The report concludes that ""no single material shows up as the best across all the human health and environmental impact categories, nor as the worst"" but that the ""risk of dioxin emissions puts PVC consistently among the worst materials for human health impacts.""  [ 39 ]     [ edit ]   Bans   The State of California is currently considering a bill that would ban the use of PVC in consumer packaging due to the threats it poses to human and environmental health and its effect on the recycling stream. [ 40 ]  Specifically, the language of the bill analysis [ 41 ]  stipulates that EPA has listed PVC as a carcinogen. It is also further cites that there are concerns about the leaching of phthalates and lead from the PVC packaging.     [ edit ]   Recycling   The symbol, or ' SPI code ', for polyvinyl chloride developed by the  Society of the Plastics Industry  so that items can be labeled for easy recycling is:    The  Unicode  character for this symbol is U+2675 (HTML  character reference  &#9845;).   Post-consumer PVC is not typically recycled due to the prohibitive cost of regrinding and recompounding the resin compared to the cost of virgin (unrecycled) resin. [ citation needed ]   Some PVC manufacturers have placed vinyl recycling programs into action, recycling both manufacturing waste back into their products, as well as post consumer PVC construction materials to reduce the load on landfills. [ citation needed ]   The  thermal depolymerization  process can safely and efficiently convert PVC into fuel and minerals, according to the company that developed it. It is not yet in widespread use.   A new process of  PVC recycling  is being developed in Europe called Texiloop. [ 42 ]  This process is based on a technology already applied industrially in Europe and Japan, called Vinyloop, which consists of recovering PVC plastic from composite materials through dissolution and precipitation. It strives to be a closed loop system, recycling its key solvent and hopefully making PVC a future  technical nutrient .

[ citation needed ]  In terms of  revenue  generated, it is one of the most valuable products of the  chemical industry . Around the world, over 50% of PVC manufactured is used in construction. As a building material, PVC is cheap, durable, and easy to assemble. The PVC world market grew with an average rate of approximately 5% in the last years and will probably reach a volume of 40 million tons by the year 2016.   It can be made softer and more flexible by the addition of  plasticizers , the most widely-used being  phthalates . In this form, it is used in  clothing  and  upholstery , and to make flexible  hoses  and tubing,  flooring , to roofing membranes, and electrical cable insulation. It is also commonly used in figurines and in inflatable products such as  waterbeds ,  pool  toys or jump houses.

Since about 57% of its mass is  chlorine , creating a given mass of PVC requires less  petroleum  than many other polymers. [ citation needed ]         By far the most widely used production process is suspension polymerization. In this process, VCM and water are introduced into the polymerization reactor and a polymerization initiator, along with other chemical additives, are added to initiate the polymerization reaction. The contents of the reaction vessel are continually mixed to maintain the suspension and ensure a uniform particle size of the PVC resin. The reaction is  exothermic , and thus requires a cooling mechanism to maintain the reactor contents at the appropriate temperature. As the volumes also contract during the reaction (PVC is denser than VCM), water is continually added to the mixture to maintain the suspension.   Once the reaction has run its course, the resulting PVC slurry is degassed and stripped to remove excess VCM (which is recycled into the next batch) then passed though a centrifuge to remove most of the excess water. The slurry is then dried further in a hot air bed and the resulting powder sieved before storage or pelletization. In normal operations, the resulting PVC has a VCM content of less than 1  part per million .   Other production processes, such as micro-suspension polymerization and emulsion polymerization, produce PVC with smaller particle sizes (10m vs 120-150m for suspension PVC) with slightly different properties and with somewhat different sets of applications.     [ edit ]   History   Polyvinyl chloride was accidentally discovered on at least two different occasions in the 19th century, first in 1835 by  Henri Victor Regnault  and in 1872 by  Eugen Baumann . On both occasions, the  polymer  appeared as a white solid inside flasks of  vinyl chloride  that had been left exposed to sunlight. In the early 20th century, the Russian chemist  Ivan Ostromislensky  and  Fritz Klatte  of the German chemical company  Griesheim-Elektron  both attempted to use PVC (polyvinyl chloride) in commercial products, but difficulties in processing the rigid, sometimes brittle polymer blocked their efforts. In 1926,  Waldo Semon  and the  B.F. Goodrich  Company developed a method to  plasticize  PVC by blending it with various additives. The result was a more flexible and more easily-processed material that soon achieved widespread commercial use.     [ edit ]   Applications   PVC's intrinsic properties make it suitable for a wide variety of applications. It is biologically and chemically resistant, making it the plastic of choice for most household sewerage pipes and other pipe applications where corrosion would limit the use of metal.   With the addition of impact modifiers and stabilizers, it becomes a popular material for window and door frames. By adding plasticizers, it can become flexible enough to be used in cabling applications as a wire insulator.     [ edit ]   Clothing   PVC has become widely used in clothing either create a leather like material or at times simply for the effect of PVC. PVC clothing is common in Goth, Punk and other alternative fashions as well as in Fetish wear. PVC is cheaper than rubber, leather or latex and so it is more widely available and worn.   PVC fabric has a sheen to it and is waterproof. It is commonly used in coats, jackets, aprons and bags because of this.     [ edit ]   Electric wires   PVC is commonly used as the insulation on electric wires; the plastic used for this purpose needs to be  plasticized .   In a fire, PVC-coated wires can form  HCl  fumes; the chlorine serves to scavenge  free radicals  and is the source of the material's  fire retardance . While HCl fumes can also pose a health hazard in their own right, HCl dissolves in moisture and breaks down onto surfaces, particularly in areas where the air is cool enough to breathe, and is not available for inhalation. [ 3 ]  Frequently in applications where smoke is a major hazard (notably in tunnels) PVC-free  LSOH  (low-smoke, zero- halogen ) cable insulation is preferred.     [ edit ]   Pipes          PVC  pipes  in use with  intumescent   firestops  at Nortown Casitas,  North York, Ontario .       Roughly half of the world's polyvinyl chloride resin manufactured annually is used for producing pipes for various municipal and industrial applications. [ 4 ]  In the water distribution market it accounts for 66 percent of the market in the US, and in sanitary sewer pipe applications, it accounts for 75 percent. [ 5 ]  Its light weight, high strength, and low reactivity make it particularly well-suited to this purpose. In addition, PVC pipes can be fused together using various solvent cements, or heat-fused (butt-fusion process, similar to joining HDPE pipe), creating permanent joints that are virtually impervious to leakage.   In February 2007, the California Building Standards Code was updated to approve the use of  chlorinated polyvinyl chloride  (CPVC) pipe for use in residential water supply piping systems. CPVC has been a nationally-accepted material in the US since 1982; however, California has only permitted its use on a limited basis since 2001. The Department of Housing and Community Development prepared and certified an Environmental Impact Report resulting in a recommendation that the Commission adopt and approve the use of CPVC. The Commission's vote was unanimous and CPVC has been placed in the 2007 California Plumbing Code. [ 6 ]   In the United States and Canada, PVC pipes account for the largest majority of pipe materials used in buried municipal applications for drinking water distribution and wastewater mains. A detailed State-of-the-Art review of PVC pipes in North America can be found in an article titled Thermoplastics at Work: A Comprehensive Review of Municipal PVC Piping Products. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Portable Electronic Accessories   PVC is finding increased use as a composite for the production of accessories or housings for portable electronics. Through a fusing process, it can adopt cleaning properties possessed by materials such as wool or cotton which can absorb dust particles and bacteria. Its inherent ability to absorb particles from the LCD screen and its form fitting characteristics make it effective.

As flat sheets, PVC is often expanded to create voids in the interior of the material, providing additional thickness without additional weight and cost. Sheets are cut using saw and rotary cutting equipment. Plasticized PVC is also used to produce thin, colored, or clear, adhesive-backed films referred to simply as vinyl. These films are typically cut on a computer-controlled  plotter  or printed in a  wide-format printer . These sheets and films are used to produce a wide variety of  commercial signage  products and markings on vehicles.     [ edit ]   Unplasticized polyvinyl chloride (uPVC)          Modern "" Tudorbethan "" house with uPVC gutters and downpipes, fascia, decorative imitation "" half-timbering "", windows, and doors       uPVC or Rigid PVC is often used in the building industry as a low-maintenance material, particularly in  Ireland  and the  UK , and in the  United States  where it is known as vinyl, or  vinyl siding . [ 8 ] [ 9 ]  The material comes in a range of colors and finishes, including a photo-effect wood finish, and is used as a substitute for painted wood, mostly for  window frames  and  sills  when installing  double glazing  in new buildings, or to replace older single glazed windows. It has many other uses including  fascia , and  siding  or  weatherboarding . The same material has almost entirely replaced the use of  cast iron  for  plumbing  and  drainage , being used for waste pipes, drainpipes,  gutters  and downpipes. [ 10 ]   Due to  environmental concerns  use of PVC is discouraged by some local authorities in countries such as  Germany  and  The Netherlands . [ 11 ] [ 12 ]  This concerns both flexible PVC and rigid uPVC as not only the plasticizers in PVC are seen as a problem but also the emissions from manufacturing and disposal. The use of modern impact modifiers offer great stability. The issues of migration and brittleness of the PVC compound are overcome. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Health and safety     [ edit ]   Phthalate plasticizers   Many vinyl products contain additional chemicals to change the chemical consistency of the product. Some of these additional chemicals called additives can leach out of vinyl products.  Plasticizers  that must be added to make PVC flexible have been an additive of particular concern.   Because soft PVC toys have been made for babies for years, there are concerns that these additives leach out of soft toys into the mouths of the children chewing on them. Additionally, adult  sex toys  have been demonstrated to contain high concentrations of the additives. [ 13 ]  In January 2006, the European Union placed a ban on six types of phthalate softeners, including DEHP ( diethylhexyl phthalate ), used in toys. [ 14 ]  In the U.S. most companies have voluntarily stopped manufacturing PVC toys with DEHP and in 2003 the US Consumer Product Safety Commission ( CPSC ) denied a petition for a ban on PVC toys made with an alternative plasticizer, DINP ( diisononyl phthalate ). [ 15 ]  In April 2006, the  European Chemicals Bureau  of the  European Commission  published an assessment of DINP which found risk ""unlikely"" for children and newborns. [ 16 ]   Vinyl  IV  bags used in neo-natal  intensive care  units have also been shown to leach DEHP. In a draft guidance paper published in September 2002, the US FDA recognizes that many medical devices with PVC containing DEHP are not used in ways that result in significant human exposure to the chemical. [1]  However, FDA is suggesting that manufacturers consider eliminating the use of DEHP in certain devices that can result in high aggregate exposures for sensitive patient populations such as neonates.   Other vinyl products, including car interiors, shower curtains, flooring, initially release chemical gases into the  air . Some studies indicate that this  outgassing  of additives may contribute to health complications, and have resulted in a call for banning the use of DEHP on shower curtains, among other uses. [ 17 ]  The Japanese car companies  Toyota ,  Nissan , and  Honda  have eliminated PVC in their car interiors starting in 2007.   In 2004, a joint Swedish-Danish research team found a statistical association between allergies in children and indoor air levels of DEHP and BBzP ( butyl benzyl phthalate ), which is used in vinyl flooring. [ 18 ]  In December 2006, the European Chemicals Bureau of the European Commission released a final draft risk assessment of BBzP which found ""no concern"" for consumer exposure including exposure to children. [ 19 ]   In November 2005, one of the largest hospital networks in the U.S.,  Catholic Healthcare West , signed a contract with  B.Braun  for vinyl-free  intravenous  bags and tubing. [ 20 ]  According to the  Center for Health, Environment & Justice  in  Falls Church, VA , which helps to coordinate a ""precautionary"" ""  PVC Campaign "", several major corporations including  Microsoft ,  Wal-Mart , and  Kaiser Permanente   announced efforts to eliminate PVC  from products and packaging in 2005. Even Target is reducing its sale of items with PVC. ( http://besafenet.com/pvc/newsreleases/target_to_reduce_use.htm )   The FDA Paper titled ""Safety Assessment of Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP)Released from PVC Medical Devices"" states that [3.2.1.3] Critically ill or injured patients may be at increased risk of developing adverse health effects from DEHP, not only by virtue of increased exposure, relative to the general population, but also because of the physiological and pharmacodynamic changes that occur in these patients, compared to healthy individuals. [ 21 ]   In 2008, The European Union's Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) reviewed the safety of DEHP in medical devices.  The SCENIHR report  states that certain medical procedures used in high risk patients result in a significant exposure to DEHP and concludes there is still a reason for having some concerns about the exposure of prematurely born male babies to medical devices containing DEHP. The Committee said there are some alternative plasticisers available for which there is sufficient toxicological data to indicate a lower hazard compared to DEHP but added that the functionality of these plasticisers should be assessed before they can be used as an alternative for DEHP in PVC medical devices.     [ edit ]   Vinyl chloride monomer   In the early 1970s, Dr. John Creech and Dr. Maurice Johnson were the first to clearly link and recognize the carcinogenicity of  vinyl chloride  monomer to humans when workers in the polyvinyl chloride polymerization section of a B.F. Goodrich plant near Louisville, Kentucky, were diagnosed with liver  angiosarcoma  also known as  hemangiosarcoma , a rare disease. [ 22 ]  Since that time, studies of PVC workers in Australia, Italy, Germany, and the UK have all associated certain types of occupational cancers with exposure to vinyl chloride. The link between angiosarcoma of the liver and long-term exposure to vinyl chloride is the only one that has been confirmed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. All the cases of angiosarcoma developed from exposure to vinyl chloride monomer, were in workers who were exposed to very high VCM levels, routinely, for many years. These workers cleaned accretions in reactors, a practice that has now been replaced by automated high pressure water jets.   A 1997 U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report concluded that the development and acceptance by the PVC industry of a closed loop polymerization process in the late 1970s ""almost completely eliminated worker exposures"" and that ""new cases of hepatic angiosarcoma in vinyl chloride polymerization workers have been virtually eliminated."" [ 23 ]   According to the EPA, ""vinyl chloride emissions from polyvinyl chloride (PVC),  ethylene dichloride  (EDC), and  vinyl chloride  monomer (VCM) plants cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to result in an increase in mortality or an increase in serious irreversible, or incapacitating reversible illness. Vinyl chloride is a known human carcinogen that causes a rare cancer of the liver."" [ 24 ]  EPA's 2001 updated Toxicological Profile and Summary Health Assessment for VCM in its Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) database lowers EPA's previous risk factor estimate by a factor of 20 and concludes that ""because of the consistent evidence for liver cancer in all the studies...and the weaker association for other sites, it is concluded that the liver is the most sensitive site, and protection against liver cancer will protect against possible  cancer induction  in other tissues."" [ 25 ]   A 1998 front-page series in the  Houston Chronicle  claimed the vinyl industry has manipulated vinyl chloride studies to avoid liability for worker exposure and to hide extensive and severe chemical spills into local communities. [ 26 ]  Retesting of community residents in 2001 by the U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) found dioxin levels similar to those in a comparison community in Louisiana and to the U.S. population. [ 27 ]  Cancer rates in the community were similar to Louisiana and US averages. [ 28 ]     [ edit ]   Dioxins   The environmentalist group  Greenpeace  has advocated the global phase-out of PVC because they claim  dioxin  is produced as a byproduct of  vinyl chloride  manufacture and from incineration of waste PVC in domestic garbage. The European Industry, however, asserts [ citation needed ]  that it has improved production processes to minimize dioxin emissions.   Also, scientific tests wherein municipal refuse containing several known concentrations of PVC was burned in a commercial-scale incinerator showed no relationship between the PVC content of the waste and dioxin emissions. [ 29 ]   [ 30 ]   PVC produces HCl upon combustion almost quantitatively related to its chlorine content. Extensive studies in Europe indicate that the chlorine found in emitted dioxins is not derived from HCl in the flue gases. Instead, most dioxins arise in the condensed solid phase by the reaction of inorganic chlorides with graphitic structures in char-containing ash particles. Copper acts as a catalyst for these reactions. [ 31 ]   Dioxins are a global health threat because they persist in the environment and can travel long distances. At very low levels, near those to which the general population is exposed, dioxins have been linked [ citation needed ]  to immune system suppression, reproductive disorders, a variety of cancers, and  endometriosis . According to a 1994 report by the British firm, ICI Chemicals & Polymers Ltd., ""It has been known since the publication of a paper in 1989 that these oxychlorination reactions [used to make vinyl chloride and some chlorinated solvents] generate polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs) and dibenzofurans (PCDFs). The reactions include all of the ingredients and conditions necessary to form PCDD/PCDFs.... It is difficult to see how any of these conditions could be modified so as to prevent PCDD/PCDF formation without seriously impairing the reaction for which the process is designed."" In other words, dioxins are an undesirable byproduct of producing vinyl chloride and eliminating the production of dioxins while maintaining the oxychlorination reaction may be difficult. Dioxins created by vinyl chloride production are released by on-site incinerators, flares, boilers, wastewater treatment systems and even in trace quantities in vinyl resins. [ 32 ]  The US EPA estimate of dioxin releases from the PVC industry was 13 grams TEQ in 1995, or less than 0.5% of the total dioxin emissions in the US; by 2002, PVC industry dioxin emissions had been further reduced by 23%. [ 33 ]   The largest well-quantified source of dioxin in the US EPA inventory of dioxin sources is barrel burning of household waste. [ 34 ]  Studies of household waste burning indicate consistent increases in dioxin generation with increasing PVC concentrations. [ 35 ]  According to the EPA dioxin inventory,  landfill fires  are likely to represent an even larger source of dioxin to the environment. A survey of international studies consistently identifies high dioxin concentrations in areas affected by open waste burning and a study that looked at the homologue pattern found the sample with the highest dioxin concentration was ""typical for the pyrolysis of PVC"". Other EU studies indicate that PVC likely ""accounts for the overwhelming majority of chlorine that is available for dioxin formation during landfill fires."" [ 36 ]   The next largest sources of dioxin in the EPA inventory are medical and municipal waste incinerators. [ 37 ]  Studies have shown a clear correlation between dioxin formation and chloride content and indicate that PVC is a significant contributor to the formation of both dioxin and PCB in incinerators. [ 38 ]   In February 2007, the Technical and Scientific Advisory Committee of the US Green Building Council (USGBC) released its report on a PVC avoidance related materials credit for the LEED Green Building Rating system. The report concludes that ""no single material shows up as the best across all the human health and environmental impact categories, nor as the worst"" but that the ""risk of dioxin emissions puts PVC consistently among the worst materials for human health impacts.""  [ 39 ]     [ edit ]   Bans   The State of California is currently considering a bill that would ban the use of PVC in consumer packaging due to the threats it poses to human and environmental health and its effect on the recycling stream. [ 40 ]  Specifically, the language of the bill analysis [ 41 ]  stipulates that EPA has listed PVC as a carcinogen. It is also further cites that there are concerns about the leaching of phthalates and lead from the PVC packaging.     [ edit ]   Recycling   The symbol, or ' SPI code ', for polyvinyl chloride developed by the  Society of the Plastics Industry  so that items can be labeled for easy recycling is:    The  Unicode  character for this symbol is U+2675 (HTML  character reference  &#9845;).   Post-consumer PVC is not typically recycled due to the prohibitive cost of regrinding and recompounding the resin compared to the cost of virgin (unrecycled) resin. [ citation needed ]   Some PVC manufacturers have placed vinyl recycling programs into action, recycling both manufacturing waste back into their products, as well as post consumer PVC construction materials to reduce the load on landfills. [ citation needed ]   The  thermal depolymerization  process can safely and efficiently convert PVC into fuel and minerals, according to the company that developed it. It is not yet in widespread use.   A new process of  PVC recycling  is being developed in Europe called Texiloop. [ 42 ]  This process is based on a technology already applied industrially in Europe and Japan, called Vinyloop, which consists of recovering PVC plastic from composite materials through dissolution and precipitation. It strives to be a closed loop system, recycling its key solvent and hopefully making PVC a future  technical nutrient .

[ citation needed ]  In terms of  revenue  generated, it is one of the most valuable products of the  chemical industry . Around the world, over 50% of PVC manufactured is used in construction. As a building material, PVC is cheap, durable, and easy to assemble. The PVC world market grew with an average rate of approximately 5% in the last years and will probably reach a volume of 40 million tons by the year 2016.   It can be made softer and more flexible by the addition of  plasticizers , the most widely-used being  phthalates . In this form, it is used in  clothing  and  upholstery , and to make flexible  hoses  and tubing,  flooring , to roofing membranes, and electrical cable insulation. It is also commonly used in figurines and in inflatable products such as  waterbeds ,  pool  toys or jump houses.

Since about 57% of its mass is  chlorine , creating a given mass of PVC requires less  petroleum  than many other polymers. [ citation needed ]         By far the most widely used production process is suspension polymerization. In this process, VCM and water are introduced into the polymerization reactor and a polymerization initiator, along with other chemical additives, are added to initiate the polymerization reaction. The contents of the reaction vessel are continually mixed to maintain the suspension and ensure a uniform particle size of the PVC resin. The reaction is  exothermic , and thus requires a cooling mechanism to maintain the reactor contents at the appropriate temperature. As the volumes also contract during the reaction (PVC is denser than VCM), water is continually added to the mixture to maintain the suspension.   Once the reaction has run its course, the resulting PVC slurry is degassed and stripped to remove excess VCM (which is recycled into the next batch) then passed though a centrifuge to remove most of the excess water. The slurry is then dried further in a hot air bed and the resulting powder sieved before storage or pelletization. In normal operations, the resulting PVC has a VCM content of less than 1  part per million .   Other production processes, such as micro-suspension polymerization and emulsion polymerization, produce PVC with smaller particle sizes (10m vs 120-150m for suspension PVC) with slightly different properties and with somewhat different sets of applications.     [ edit ]   History   Polyvinyl chloride was accidentally discovered on at least two different occasions in the 19th century, first in 1835 by  Henri Victor Regnault  and in 1872 by  Eugen Baumann . On both occasions, the  polymer  appeared as a white solid inside flasks of  vinyl chloride  that had been left exposed to sunlight. In the early 20th century, the Russian chemist  Ivan Ostromislensky  and  Fritz Klatte  of the German chemical company  Griesheim-Elektron  both attempted to use PVC (polyvinyl chloride) in commercial products, but difficulties in processing the rigid, sometimes brittle polymer blocked their efforts. In 1926,  Waldo Semon  and the  B.F. Goodrich  Company developed a method to  plasticize  PVC by blending it with various additives. The result was a more flexible and more easily-processed material that soon achieved widespread commercial use.     [ edit ]   Applications   PVC's intrinsic properties make it suitable for a wide variety of applications. It is biologically and chemically resistant, making it the plastic of choice for most household sewerage pipes and other pipe applications where corrosion would limit the use of metal.   With the addition of impact modifiers and stabilizers, it becomes a popular material for window and door frames. By adding plasticizers, it can become flexible enough to be used in cabling applications as a wire insulator.     [ edit ]   Clothing   PVC has become widely used in clothing either create a leather like material or at times simply for the effect of PVC. PVC clothing is common in Goth, Punk and other alternative fashions as well as in Fetish wear. PVC is cheaper than rubber, leather or latex and so it is more widely available and worn.   PVC fabric has a sheen to it and is waterproof. It is commonly used in coats, jackets, aprons and bags because of this.     [ edit ]   Electric wires   PVC is commonly used as the insulation on electric wires; the plastic used for this purpose needs to be  plasticized .   In a fire, PVC-coated wires can form  HCl  fumes; the chlorine serves to scavenge  free radicals  and is the source of the material's  fire retardance . While HCl fumes can also pose a health hazard in their own right, HCl dissolves in moisture and breaks down onto surfaces, particularly in areas where the air is cool enough to breathe, and is not available for inhalation. [ 3 ]  Frequently in applications where smoke is a major hazard (notably in tunnels) PVC-free  LSOH  (low-smoke, zero- halogen ) cable insulation is preferred.     [ edit ]   Pipes          PVC  pipes  in use with  intumescent   firestops  at Nortown Casitas,  North York, Ontario .       Roughly half of the world's polyvinyl chloride resin manufactured annually is used for producing pipes for various municipal and industrial applications. [ 4 ]  In the water distribution market it accounts for 66 percent of the market in the US, and in sanitary sewer pipe applications, it accounts for 75 percent. [ 5 ]  Its light weight, high strength, and low reactivity make it particularly well-suited to this purpose. In addition, PVC pipes can be fused together using various solvent cements, or heat-fused (butt-fusion process, similar to joining HDPE pipe), creating permanent joints that are virtually impervious to leakage.   In February 2007, the California Building Standards Code was updated to approve the use of  chlorinated polyvinyl chloride  (CPVC) pipe for use in residential water supply piping systems. CPVC has been a nationally-accepted material in the US since 1982; however, California has only permitted its use on a limited basis since 2001. The Department of Housing and Community Development prepared and certified an Environmental Impact Report resulting in a recommendation that the Commission adopt and approve the use of CPVC. The Commission's vote was unanimous and CPVC has been placed in the 2007 California Plumbing Code. [ 6 ]   In the United States and Canada, PVC pipes account for the largest majority of pipe materials used in buried municipal applications for drinking water distribution and wastewater mains. A detailed State-of-the-Art review of PVC pipes in North America can be found in an article titled Thermoplastics at Work: A Comprehensive Review of Municipal PVC Piping Products. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Portable Electronic Accessories   PVC is finding increased use as a composite for the production of accessories or housings for portable electronics. Through a fusing process, it can adopt cleaning properties possessed by materials such as wool or cotton which can absorb dust particles and bacteria. Its inherent ability to absorb particles from the LCD screen and its form fitting characteristics make it effective. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Signs   In flat sheet form, polyvinyl chloride is formed in a variety of thicknesses and colors. As flat sheets, PVC is often expanded to create voids in the interior of the material, providing additional thickness without additional weight and cost. Sheets are cut using saw and rotary cutting equipment. Plasticized PVC is also used to produce thin, colored, or clear, adhesive-backed films referred to simply as vinyl. These films are typically cut on a computer-controlled  plotter  or printed in a  wide-format printer . These sheets and films are used to produce a wide variety of  commercial signage  products and markings on vehicles.     [ edit ]   Unplasticized polyvinyl chloride (uPVC)          Modern "" Tudorbethan "" house with uPVC gutters and downpipes, fascia, decorative imitation "" half-timbering "", windows, and doors       uPVC or Rigid PVC is often used in the building industry as a low-maintenance material, particularly in  Ireland  and the  UK , and in the  United States  where it is known as vinyl, or  vinyl siding . [ 8 ] [ 9 ]  The material comes in a range of colors and finishes, including a photo-effect wood finish, and is used as a substitute for painted wood, mostly for  window frames  and  sills  when installing  double glazing  in new buildings, or to replace older single glazed windows. It has many other uses including  fascia , and  siding  or  weatherboarding . The same material has almost entirely replaced the use of  cast iron  for  plumbing  and  drainage , being used for waste pipes, drainpipes,  gutters  and downpipes. [ 10 ]   Due to  environmental concerns  use of PVC is discouraged by some local authorities in countries such as  Germany  and  The Netherlands . [ 11 ] [ 12 ]  This concerns both flexible PVC and rigid uPVC as not only the plasticizers in PVC are seen as a problem but also the emissions from manufacturing and disposal. The use of modern impact modifiers offer great stability. The issues of migration and brittleness of the PVC compound are overcome. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Health and safety     [ edit ]   Phthalate plasticizers   Many vinyl products contain additional chemicals to change the chemical consistency of the product. Some of these additional chemicals called additives can leach out of vinyl products.  Plasticizers  that must be added to make PVC flexible have been an additive of particular concern.   Because soft PVC toys have been made for babies for years, there are concerns that these additives leach out of soft toys into the mouths of the children chewing on them. Additionally, adult  sex toys  have been demonstrated to contain high concentrations of the additives. [ 13 ]  In January 2006, the European Union placed a ban on six types of phthalate softeners, including DEHP ( diethylhexyl phthalate ), used in toys. [ 14 ]  In the U.S. most companies have voluntarily stopped manufacturing PVC toys with DEHP and in 2003 the US Consumer Product Safety Commission ( CPSC ) denied a petition for a ban on PVC toys made with an alternative plasticizer, DINP ( diisononyl phthalate ). [ 15 ]  In April 2006, the  European Chemicals Bureau  of the  European Commission  published an assessment of DINP which found risk ""unlikely"" for children and newborns. [ 16 ]   Vinyl  IV  bags used in neo-natal  intensive care  units have also been shown to leach DEHP. In a draft guidance paper published in September 2002, the US FDA recognizes that many medical devices with PVC containing DEHP are not used in ways that result in significant human exposure to the chemical. [1]  However, FDA is suggesting that manufacturers consider eliminating the use of DEHP in certain devices that can result in high aggregate exposures for sensitive patient populations such as neonates.   Other vinyl products, including car interiors, shower curtains, flooring, initially release chemical gases into the  air . Some studies indicate that this  outgassing  of additives may contribute to health complications, and have resulted in a call for banning the use of DEHP on shower curtains, among other uses. [ 17 ]  The Japanese car companies  Toyota ,  Nissan , and  Honda  have eliminated PVC in their car interiors starting in 2007.   In 2004, a joint Swedish-Danish research team found a statistical association between allergies in children and indoor air levels of DEHP and BBzP ( butyl benzyl phthalate ), which is used in vinyl flooring. [ 18 ]  In December 2006, the European Chemicals Bureau of the European Commission released a final draft risk assessment of BBzP which found ""no concern"" for consumer exposure including exposure to children. [ 19 ]   In November 2005, one of the largest hospital networks in the U.S.,  Catholic Healthcare West , signed a contract with  B.Braun  for vinyl-free  intravenous  bags and tubing. [ 20 ]  According to the  Center for Health, Environment & Justice  in  Falls Church, VA , which helps to coordinate a ""precautionary"" ""  PVC Campaign "", several major corporations including  Microsoft ,  Wal-Mart , and  Kaiser Permanente   announced efforts to eliminate PVC  from products and packaging in 2005. Even Target is reducing its sale of items with PVC. ( http://besafenet.com/pvc/newsreleases/target_to_reduce_use.htm )   The FDA Paper titled ""Safety Assessment of Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP)Released from PVC Medical Devices"" states that [3.2.1.3] Critically ill or injured patients may be at increased risk of developing adverse health effects from DEHP, not only by virtue of increased exposure, relative to the general population, but also because of the physiological and pharmacodynamic changes that occur in these patients, compared to healthy individuals. [ 21 ]   In 2008, The European Union's Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) reviewed the safety of DEHP in medical devices.  The SCENIHR report  states that certain medical procedures used in high risk patients result in a significant exposure to DEHP and concludes there is still a reason for having some concerns about the exposure of prematurely born male babies to medical devices containing DEHP. The Committee said there are some alternative plasticisers available for which there is sufficient toxicological data to indicate a lower hazard compared to DEHP but added that the functionality of these plasticisers should be assessed before they can be used as an alternative for DEHP in PVC medical devices.     [ edit ]   Vinyl chloride monomer   In the early 1970s, Dr. John Creech and Dr. Maurice Johnson were the first to clearly link and recognize the carcinogenicity of  vinyl chloride  monomer to humans when workers in the polyvinyl chloride polymerization section of a B.F. Goodrich plant near Louisville, Kentucky, were diagnosed with liver  angiosarcoma  also known as  hemangiosarcoma , a rare disease. [ 22 ]  Since that time, studies of PVC workers in Australia, Italy, Germany, and the UK have all associated certain types of occupational cancers with exposure to vinyl chloride. The link between angiosarcoma of the liver and long-term exposure to vinyl chloride is the only one that has been confirmed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. All the cases of angiosarcoma developed from exposure to vinyl chloride monomer, were in workers who were exposed to very high VCM levels, routinely, for many years. These workers cleaned accretions in reactors, a practice that has now been replaced by automated high pressure water jets.   A 1997 U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report concluded that the development and acceptance by the PVC industry of a closed loop polymerization process in the late 1970s ""almost completely eliminated worker exposures"" and that ""new cases of hepatic angiosarcoma in vinyl chloride polymerization workers have been virtually eliminated."" [ 23 ]   According to the EPA, ""vinyl chloride emissions from polyvinyl chloride (PVC),  ethylene dichloride  (EDC), and  vinyl chloride  monomer (VCM) plants cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to result in an increase in mortality or an increase in serious irreversible, or incapacitating reversible illness. Vinyl chloride is a known human carcinogen that causes a rare cancer of the liver."" [ 24 ]  EPA's 2001 updated Toxicological Profile and Summary Health Assessment for VCM in its Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) database lowers EPA's previous risk factor estimate by a factor of 20 and concludes that ""because of the consistent evidence for liver cancer in all the studies...and the weaker association for other sites, it is concluded that the liver is the most sensitive site, and protection against liver cancer will protect against possible  cancer induction  in other tissues."" [ 25 ]   A 1998 front-page series in the  Houston Chronicle  claimed the vinyl industry has manipulated vinyl chloride studies to avoid liability for worker exposure and to hide extensive and severe chemical spills into local communities. [ 26 ]  Retesting of community residents in 2001 by the U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) found dioxin levels similar to those in a comparison community in Louisiana and to the U.S. population. [ 27 ]  Cancer rates in the community were similar to Louisiana and US averages. [ 28 ]     [ edit ]   Dioxins   The environmentalist group  Greenpeace  has advocated the global phase-out of PVC because they claim  dioxin  is produced as a byproduct of  vinyl chloride  manufacture and from incineration of waste PVC in domestic garbage. The European Industry, however, asserts [ citation needed ]  that it has improved production processes to minimize dioxin emissions.   Also, scientific tests wherein municipal refuse containing several known concentrations of PVC was burned in a commercial-scale incinerator showed no relationship between the PVC content of the waste and dioxin emissions. [ 29 ]   [ 30 ]   PVC produces HCl upon combustion almost quantitatively related to its chlorine content. Extensive studies in Europe indicate that the chlorine found in emitted dioxins is not derived from HCl in the flue gases. Instead, most dioxins arise in the condensed solid phase by the reaction of inorganic chlorides with graphitic structures in char-containing ash particles. Copper acts as a catalyst for these reactions. [ 31 ]   Dioxins are a global health threat because they persist in the environment and can travel long distances. At very low levels, near those to which the general population is exposed, dioxins have been linked [ citation needed ]  to immune system suppression, reproductive disorders, a variety of cancers, and  endometriosis . According to a 1994 report by the British firm, ICI Chemicals & Polymers Ltd., ""It has been known since the publication of a paper in 1989 that these oxychlorination reactions [used to make vinyl chloride and some chlorinated solvents] generate polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs) and dibenzofurans (PCDFs). The reactions include all of the ingredients and conditions necessary to form PCDD/PCDFs.... It is difficult to see how any of these conditions could be modified so as to prevent PCDD/PCDF formation without seriously impairing the reaction for which the process is designed."" In other words, dioxins are an undesirable byproduct of producing vinyl chloride and eliminating the production of dioxins while maintaining the oxychlorination reaction may be difficult. Dioxins created by vinyl chloride production are released by on-site incinerators, flares, boilers, wastewater treatment systems and even in trace quantities in vinyl resins. [ 32 ]  The US EPA estimate of dioxin releases from the PVC industry was 13 grams TEQ in 1995, or less than 0.5% of the total dioxin emissions in the US; by 2002, PVC industry dioxin emissions had been further reduced by 23%. [ 33 ]   The largest well-quantified source of dioxin in the US EPA inventory of dioxin sources is barrel burning of household waste. [ 34 ]  Studies of household waste burning indicate consistent increases in dioxin generation with increasing PVC concentrations. [ 35 ]  According to the EPA dioxin inventory,  landfill fires  are likely to represent an even larger source of dioxin to the environment. A survey of international studies consistently identifies high dioxin concentrations in areas affected by open waste burning and a study that looked at the homologue pattern found the sample with the highest dioxin concentration was ""typical for the pyrolysis of PVC"". Other EU studies indicate that PVC likely ""accounts for the overwhelming majority of chlorine that is available for dioxin formation during landfill fires."" [ 36 ]   The next largest sources of dioxin in the EPA inventory are medical and municipal waste incinerators. [ 37 ]  Studies have shown a clear correlation between dioxin formation and chloride content and indicate that PVC is a significant contributor to the formation of both dioxin and PCB in incinerators. [ 38 ]   In February 2007, the Technical and Scientific Advisory Committee of the US Green Building Council (USGBC) released its report on a PVC avoidance related materials credit for the LEED Green Building Rating system. The report concludes that ""no single material shows up as the best across all the human health and environmental impact categories, nor as the worst"" but that the ""risk of dioxin emissions puts PVC consistently among the worst materials for human health impacts.""  [ 39 ]     [ edit ]   Bans   The State of California is currently considering a bill that would ban the use of PVC in consumer packaging due to the threats it poses to human and environmental health and its effect on the recycling stream. [ 40 ]  Specifically, the language of the bill analysis [ 41 ]  stipulates that EPA has listed PVC as a carcinogen. It is also further cites that there are concerns about the leaching of phthalates and lead from the PVC packaging.     [ edit ]   Recycling   The symbol, or ' SPI code ', for polyvinyl chloride developed by the  Society of the Plastics Industry  so that items can be labeled for easy recycling is:    The  Unicode  character for this symbol is U+2675 (HTML  character reference  &#9845;).   Post-consumer PVC is not typically recycled due to the prohibitive cost of regrinding and recompounding the resin compared to the cost of virgin (unrecycled) resin. [ citation needed ]   Some PVC manufacturers have placed vinyl recycling programs into action, recycling both manufacturing waste back into their products, as well as post consumer PVC construction materials to reduce the load on landfills. [ citation needed ]   The  thermal depolymerization  process can safely and efficiently convert PVC into fuel and minerals, according to the company that developed it. It is not yet in widespread use.   A new process of  PVC recycling  is being developed in Europe called Texiloop. [ 42 ]  This process is based on a technology already applied industrially in Europe and Japan, called Vinyloop, which consists of recovering PVC plastic from composite materials through dissolution and precipitation. It strives to be a closed loop system, recycling its key solvent and hopefully making PVC a future  technical nutrient .

Problems associated          with PVC stressed fabric are toxic emissions during welding and the release          of toxic fumes in the case of a fire. PVC geomembranes are also used as          linings in outdoor landscaping, for example in ponds.          Insulation                   The use of PVC profiles          in cavity closure insulation is increasing. Insulation bonded to polyethylene          profiles is an alternative. Sound barriers are also made of PVC, although          alternatives of EVA extruded sheet are also available.         top         Exteriors;          Siding, Cladding, Profiles & Coatings         PVC siding or cladding          is widely used in the USA and to a lesser extent elsewhere. There are          many alternatives on the market including solid wood, plywood, strand          board, wood-resin composites, stucco, fibre cement, masonite as well as          aluminium. Siding must withstand all types of weather, look attractive          and be affordable to buy and install.         If using wood, the          buyer should ensure that the product is from a certified sustainable source          ( Forest          Stewardship Council certified ).           top         Windows          and Doors           Despite          the claims made for PVC-u windows and doors (PVC-u stands for unplasticised          PVC) wooden window frames have advantages over PVC. PVC-u windows do degrade,          they are not maintenance free and worst of all they cannot be repaired          where necessary.         Developments in timber          window design and finishing products mean that modern, high performance          timber windows need minimal maintenance and potentially have a significantly          longer life than PVC-u. Though maintenance of high performance timber          windows is easy and minimal some may consider that they are not suitable          for high rise buildings. In this case aluminium and wood combination windows          should be considered in preference to PVC.         High performance,          double-glazed, timber windows need not cost more than PVC-u equivalents.          In the UK the National Housing Federation and some local authorities have          found PVC-u window frames to be more          expensive in terms of initial capital cost and more expensive or equal          to timber over the lifetime of the windows.         Reclaimed wood or          local timbers can be used. In general wooden windows can last for over          fifty years and even after that time can be renovated whereas PVC windows          have to be totally replaced after 20 - 25 years.          top         Look out for sustainable          timber         Timber is repairable,          adaptable and durable. From well managed sources it is a sustainable,          environmentally friendly resource. Independent certification by the  Forestry          Stewardship Council  should be sought as proof of acceptable forestry          practices. As long as care is also taken in the choice of preservatives,          paints and stains, timber windows are by far the best environmental choice.         Other Polymers           - In Berlin, where PVC restrictions on building are in force, new polyolefin          windows from were installed by the City Council in May 1996. In Austria          leading PVC window manufacturing company, Internorm, have developed a          VC/chlorine-free plastic window frame.         top         Interiors;          flooring         Alternatives          to PVC flooring are easy to find, are competitively priced and perform          as well as, if not better than PVC.          Natural materials.          Ceramic tiles and marble are highly durable. Stone and terrazos are also          traditional, durable materials. When a softer floor surface is required,          wood, cork and linoleum can be used. Cork is          indigenous to the Mediterranean region. It is hard- wearing, very sound          absorbent and popular because it is agreeable to walk on due to reflection          of warmth and its natural bounce. Cork floor coverings are available with          untreated or sealed surfaces. Types which are sealed with artificial resins          (polyurethane) or PVC should be          avoided.          Wood  - Wood          is a natural alternative to PVC flooring which is very durable and can          be renovated by planing or sanding. Increasingly, reclaimed wood floors          are available. If using new wood it is important to source wood from  certified          forests  where clear-cutting and other environmentally damaging practises          are banned.          Linoleum  once          dominated the market for elastic floorings before the 1950's trend for          synthetic materials. Linoleum is made of renewable materials and consists          mainly of vegetable linseed oil to which a natural resin is added. The          mixture is spread on hessian fabric and the surface treated with water-based          acrylic 'dispersion' paint. Linoleum          has very low flammability, is antistatic, light resistant, sound-absorbent,          resistant to fats and oils and has a natural          antibacterial effect.          Renovation:           Cork and wooden flooring can be renovated and for that reason, this flooring          has a longer durability which often justifies the higher costs of fitting.          Linoleum can also be partially renovated to repair normal wear and tear.         Synthetic materials          for special cases could be rubber and other polymers.          Rubber -  Several          companies produce rubber floor coverings. Particularly in situations such          as airports or sports stadiums where floor coverings have to met great          demands in durability, rubber floor coverings have proven effective. Rubber          flooring which contains chlorine-based ingredients should be avoided.          Ethylene propylene diene (EPDM) type rubber is recommended by the Danish          Environmental Protection Agency as an alternative to PVC.          Other polymers          -  Polyolefin floor coverings (PP and PE) are now offered by leading          flooring manufacturers such as the French company Tarkett Sommer and the          British company Amtico. The main application for polyolefin          flooring is for industrial use but flooring for domestic use is also available.          They are non-flammable, sound absorbent and resistant to wear and tear.         top         Interiors:          walls & decoration         Sheet-style vinyl          wall coverings are sought after by consumers who are looking for a lightweight,          durable, washable and easily installed material that can be applied to          standard wall systems. There are many alternatives that can offer the          same qualities, which are made of sustainably acquired materials, and          which do not present the health hazards inherent to PVC (vinyl).          top         Electrical          Equipment          All          the alternative cable types have better properties than PVC in the event          of a fire. They generate less smoke, do not release hydrochloric acid          or dioxins and have fire-resistant qualities which match or outstrip PVC.          All PVC-free cables cost more at present but will drop in price as consumer          and municipalities demand safer material use.          The use of PVC-free          electrical cables is growing, particularly in the transportation sector,          where safety is critical. Many underground railway systems in the USA          and Europe use PVC free cables (also known as low-smoke, zero-halogen          or LSOH cables); Vienna, Berlin, Dusseldorf, Bilbao and London all avoid          PVC cables underground. Similarly, Eurotunnel, Deutche Bahn, P & O          Cruises and the US Navy all specify PVC free cables.          Electrical cables          manufacturers have already developed and marketed several halogen-free          alternatives to PVC cable as a result of concern over PVC combustion emissions.          When cable is designated halogen-free this means it cannot contain PVC          or any other organo-chlorine based chemicals.          The main alternative          power cables use polyethylene as an insulation and sheathing material.          Rubber sheathed cables are also available. Also included in this section          are alternatives to PVC for fittings, duct, and trunking, for example,          polyethylene and steel are alternatives to PVC pipes for electricity cables.         top         Pipelines          and Accessories         One          of the largest uses of unplasticised PVC (known as u-PVC) is in rigid          pipes for above ground and underground drainage, gas pipes and electrical          cables (see the above Electrical equipment section).         There are a range          of traditional and new material alternative to PVC in above/below ground          and indoor/outdoor piping. Many alternatives offer the same or improved          qualities over PVC and do not pose the same lifecycle hazards.         For underground sewage          pipes vitrified clay pipes are suitable and are very durable. The expected          service life of a clay pipe is commonly given as 100 years - 5-4 times          longer than a PVC system. Clay pipes also have a high resistance to chemicals          in waste water. Alternative materials to PVC in sewage pipes may perform          better over time: the city of Nyborg in Denmark reported that the PVC          main sewage pipe had become extremely brittle and required frequent replacement.          In the UK, Anglian Water specify polyethylene or ductile iron pipes in          their mains renovation programme. Neither do they allow developers to          use PVC pipe in new sewage schemes for engineering reasons. High Density          Polyethylene (HDPE) pipes are more flexible and shock resistant.          For above ground drainage,          ie. soil and vent pipes and rainwater drainage, materials such as zinc,          cast iron, copper, galvanised steel or aluminium can be used as an alternative.          Metal guttering has a longer service life          although it may require some maintenance.          The UK gas industry          now only uses medium density polyethylene (MDPE) pipe because it is more          flexible than PVC pipe.         top                     More info:                    - Search and Browse the database by  country          or product category                                  links           |  disclaimer

This document discusses Inspection and Reporting the Condition of Private Residential Waste Disposal Systems - or - Where Does it Go When I Flush? and ... Will We Meet Again?   INSPECTING THE D-BOX - Inspecting the Septic System Distribution Box   The distribution box (more than one may be in use) connects a single effluent line from the septic tank to a network of absorption system components such as drainfield leach lines or to a network of seepage pits or galleys.    The photo (left) shows the adjustable weir outlets that permit balancing flow among drainfield lines. (Source EPA who used photo from Ayres Associates.) More sketches of D-box layouts and configurations are shown in this  EPA drawing.   Regulating effluent distribution : In good system design the outlet openings from the distribution box to each drainfield line can be adjusted to regulate the flow among the various absorption lines.    Elegantly simple, a plug with an eccentric hole is inserted into the end of each leach line fed from the D-box. By turning the plug in the end of the leach line pipe one can place the eccentric hole higher or lower with respect to the bottom of the distribution box, thus compensating for a slightly tipped box, differences in leach line length, or differences in leach line condition.   Uneven effluent distribution : If a distribution box becomes tipped (or clogged) effluent may be routed to only a portion of the absorption system, thus overloading it and leading to a ""breakout"" of effluent at the surface or to clogging and system backup.    An examination of the septic system distribution box interior  may show flood lines in the box if the drain field has been clogged or saturated in the past even if at the time of inspection the box is not flooded.   If the septic drainfields have been flooded  you should be pessimistic about the remaining life of the absorption system. If the box is tipped and/or effluent has not been uniformly distributed among the drainfield  lines (assuming they are of equal length and in equally good soils), only a simple adjustment of the outflow may be needed.  Round plugs with eccentric openings may be present or can be inserted in the D-box outlet openings to regulate flow  among the individual absorption lines.

This  condition can flood one or two lines leading to early field failure.   The Septic Systems Online Book - Where Are We?
