INTRODUCTION  Purpose of the Working Paper  Through House Bill 9951, the Maryland General Assembly has required that the Maryland Health Care Commission (""MHCC"" or the ""Commission"") examine the major policy issues of the Certificate of Need (""CON"") process. This is one in a series of working papers which the Commission will be releasing in 2000 and 2001, which will examine specific issues and implications of changes to the CON model of regulation. The purpose of this report is to examine the current CON policy and regulatory issues affecting nursing home services in Maryland, and to outline several alternative options for changes to the Certificate of Need program and their potential implications. Nursing home services is one of the services defined in health planning statute (Health General, Article 19-123(a)) that requires a Certificate of Need to establish, and in some cases, to expand. B. Invitation for Public Comment  The Commission invites all interested organizations and individuals to submit comments on the options presented in this working paper. Written comments should be submitted no later than close of business Monday, November 20, 2000 to: Barbara G. McLean, Acting Executive Director Maryland Health Care Commission 4201 Patterson Avenue; 5th Floor Baltimore, Maryland 21215-2299 Fax: 410-358-1311 Email: bmclean@mhcc.state.md.us C. Organization of the Working Paper  This paper is organized in five major sections. Following this introduction, Part II of the paper contains an overview of nursing home services, including a definition of the services, an inventory of existing providers, and data on utilization trends. This section of the paper also discusses alternatives to and the future of nursing homes, reimbursement issues facing nursing homes, quality of care issues, access to care, cost efficiency of nursing homes, and nursing home bed need projections and State Health Plan standards. Part III compares Maryland Certificate of Need regulation to what other states are doing with regard to regulating nursing homes. Part IV describes the functions of the state government agencies with an interest related to their authority over activities in nursing homes. Part V of the paper outlines alternative regulatory strategies for the Certificate of Need program that reflect different assumptions about the role of government regulatory 1  Chapter 702, Acts of 1999.  4   agencies and the role of the market place in protecting the public interest. The appendices to the working paper include a series of detailed data tables on nursing homes, a listing of licensed nursing homes, a listing of assisted living facilities, and the nursing home bed need methodology.  5   II.  MARYLAND NURSING HOMES: OVERVIEW  A. Definition of Nursing Homes For health planning purposes, a nursing home is defined as a facility licensed in accordance with COMAR 10.07.02 that admits patients suffering from diseases, disabilities, or advanced age who require medical service and nursing service rendered by or under the supervision of a registered nurse. As of October 1, 2000, Maryland had 275 nursing homes facilities (including other facilities or units with comprehensive care beds) with 31,004 licensed and operating beds. In addition, there were: 484 beds that are CON-approved but not yet licensed, and a total of 1,707 temporarily delicensed beds being maintained on the Commission's inventory. There were a combined total of 32,682 beds in Maryland's nursing home bed inventory as of October 1, 2000.2 Operating nursing home beds are those beds which have received and hold a ""comprehensive care facility"" (nursing home) license from the Office of Health Care Quality under COMAR 10.07.02. Such facilities have either received a Certificate of Need, or been grandfathered with successive changes to the health planning statute. Temporarily delicensed beds are those beds granted permission by the Commission to be taken off the license and out of service, pending plans to delicense or otherwise use the beds. To clarify its regulatory practice with regard to off-line capacity, the Commission has proposed regulations that establish conditions under which facilities may temporarily remove beds from their license, or close an entire facility on a temporary basis. CON-approved beds have received a Certificate of Need from the Commission (or its predecessor agency, the Maryland Health Resources Planning Commission) by meeting all of the appropriate standards under COMAR 10.24.08 (the State Health Plan chapter that addresses long term care services) as well as the general criteria applied to all Certificate of Need reviews at COMAR 10.24.01.08. Waiver beds are those beds approved under COMAR 10.24.01.02(A)(2)a., generally involving a change in capacity of 10 beds, or 10 percent, whichever is less. Table 2 below illustrates the number of the nursing home beds that have been approved between fiscal years 1990 and 2000, and the means by which each portion of the year's total was approved:    CON-approved bed need projected by the State Health Plan; Waiver beds; or CON-excluded beds at continuing care retirement communities.  The line traveling from the upper left of the chart to the lower right illustrates the drop in overall nursing home occupancy during the same period.  2  See Appendix C for an inventory of comprehensive care beds by county and health service area.  6   Figure 1 Nursing Home Beds Approved in Maryland: 1990 - 2000 900 800 700 Number of Bed s 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 1991 1992 1994 1997 2000 1990 1993 1995 1996 1998 1999 95% 94% 93% 92% 91% 90% 89% 88% 87% 86% 85% Occu pancy  CCRC-CON E xc lude d  Wa ive r Beds  Comp. Care Be ds  Oc cupancy  The types of beds licensed as comprehensive care facility, or nursing home, beds can be found at other kinds of facilities, as so-called ""subacute"" units in hospitals (or in separate units in regular nursing facilities) and within continuing care retirement communities, or CCRCs. Subacute care is not a licensure category; such care can be provided in hospitals or nursing homes. Subacute care beds may be licensed as special care (COMAR 10.07.02.14-1, 14.2) Subacute refers to care defined under COMAR 10.24.05 as follows:  Subacute care means comprehensive inpatient care that is designed for someone who has had an acute illness, injury, or exacerbation of a disease process whose treatment does not require to any significant degree, high technology monitoring or complex diagnostic procedures, and which has the following characteristics: It is goal-oriented treatment rendered immediately after, or instead of, acute hospitalization to treat one or more specific active complex conditions or to administer one or more technically-complex treatments in the context of a person's underlying long-term conditions and overall situation;    7     It requires the coordinated services of an interdisciplinary team including physicians, nurses, and other relevant professional disciplines, who are trained and knowledgeable to assess and manage these specific conditions and perform the necessary procedures; It is given as part of a specifically-defined program within a dedicated unit, regardless of site; It is generally more intensive than traditional comprehensive facility [nursing home] care and less intensive than acute care; It requires daily to weekly recurrent patient assessment and review of the clinical course and treatment plan for a limited period of several days to several months, until the patient's condition is stabilized or a predetermined treatment course is completed3; and Requires certification from the Office of Health Care Quality as a provider of special care in accordance with COMAR 10.07.02.14.1-14.2.        Continuing Care Retirement Communities (""CCRCs"") are communities, usually including independent living units, assisted living units, and nursing homes, regulated by the Maryland Department of Aging under Article 70B and COMAR 14.11.02. To distinguish such communities from senior housing complexes and other types of living arrangements for seniors, the Maryland Department of Aging (""MDoA"") requires a community to meet the following criteria for certification as a CCRC:   Its subscribers pay an entrance fee that is, at a minimum, three times the weighted average of the monthly service fees; Subscribers sign a contract for a period of more than one year, usually for life, that requires either a transfer of assets or payment of an entrance fee and monthly fees to live in a secure and protected environment; and The community provides, at a minimum, access to medical and nursing services or other health-related benefits.    The nursing home beds in CCRCs are also regulated under the Commission's Certificate of Need program (COMAR 10.24.01) and under planning regulations (COMAR 10.24.08). If a CCRC applies for, and successfully obtains, a CON for nursing home beds, it can serve both its own enrolled residents as well as the general public. However, CCRCs can also obtain nursing home beds through a CON exclusion under COMAR 10.24.01 B(11)(b)(ii). To qualify for this exclusion, a CCRC must satisfy three  3  Weiss, Cathy and Rebecca Rosenstein, Ph.D., Subacute Care Project: Preliminary Report. December, 1995.  8   criteria, two of which have been altered by legislation enacted during the 2000 legislative session.  Beds obtained through this exemption must not exceed the ratio of one bed for every five independent living units (or 20 percent). This year's legislation raises that ratio to 24 percent for those communities with fewer than 300 independent living units. The CCRC must serve exclusively its own residents in the nursing home beds; it cannot market directly to the general public. This was modified in 1999 to permit the admission of two spouses (or two persons having a long-term significant relationship) to a CCRC, where one is admitted to an independent or assisted living unit and one is admitted directly into a nursing home bed. The 2000 statutory changes provide for ""limited direct admission"" of persons directly into a nursing home bed who have a reasonable likelihood of eventual transfer to an independent or assisted living unit. These admissions cannot exceed 20 percent of the CCRC's nursing home beds and cannot cause occupancy to exceed 95 percent.4 It must provide nursing home care on the same campus as the independent living units.5 B. Supply and Distribution of Nursing Homes in Maryland In order to have some perspective on the changes in Maryland's nursing home bed capacity, it is useful to look at the changes in that bed capacity from 1990 to 2000.

Final Report. February, 1999.  9   While the number of licensed beds has increased, as discussed below, the rate of increase of licensed beds has slowed. Also, it should be noted, the count of 32,682 nursing home beds included 1,707 temporarily delicensed beds (plus another 684 beds from now-closed facilities acquired for re-development), which, in accordance with proposed regulations, will either be brought on line, or removed from the inventory.

Per COMAR 10.24.08.05L(2) and (3), waiver beds cannot be banked, or more beds cannot be obtained until these beds become licensed and operational.  6  Village Care Nursing Center, Willow Brook Nursing and Rehabilitation Center; Upper Marlboro Nursing and Rehabilitation Center relinquished its Certificate of Need in a withdrawal proceeding.  10   C. Trends in the Utilization of Maryland's Nursing Home Services In order to place the nursing home industry in context, it is necessary to examine the target population of nursing homes. Although nursing homes serve persons of all ages, about 90 percent of those residing in nursing homes are 65 and over. Therefore, the focus of this section will be those individuals in Maryland's population aged 65 and older. Nationally, it is well documented that the population is aging, due in large part to the aging of the large Baby Boom Generation, i.e. those born between 1946 and 1964. For example, in 1900, the 65 and older population nationally represented 4.1 percent of the total population. By 2040, it is estimated that the 65 and over age group in the U.S. will be 20.3 percent of the total population. Similarly in Maryland, the 65 and older population represents 11 percent of the total population in 2000. This is expected to rise to 16 percent in 2020.7 The development of an older population is due not only to the growing ranks of Baby Boomers, but also to the extension in life expectancy. A child born in 1997 could expect to live to 76.5 years, about 29 years longer than a child born in 1900. This is due primarily to reduced death rates for children and young adults. Life expectancy at age 65 increased by only 2.4 years between 1900 and 1960, but has increased by 3.3 years since 1960.8 Income for the elderly has also improved. Income for households headed by persons 65+ was reported at a median income nationally of $31,568 in 1998. Maryland residents fare better than the national average. For all ages, the median income per household in Maryland in 1998 was $50,016 compared to $38,233 nationally. In terms of the 65+ population, 8.9 percent were below the federal poverty limit in Maryland as compared to 10.6 percent for the U.S.9 With increasing age come increasing levels of disability. In 1990-1991, 9 percent of persons aged 65-69 needed assistance with everyday activities as compared to 50 percent of those 85 years and over.10 However, recent research findings indicate that previous levels of disability may actually be declining. According to analyses from the National Long-Term Care surveys, the percentage of both institutional and communitybased persons aged 65+ who were disabled declined between 1982 and 1994. For those persons in the community, the percentage disabled dropped from 18.0 percent in 1982 to 16.0 percent in 1994. For those individuals in institutions, the proportion declined from 5.7 percent to 5.1 percent for the same period. From 1982 to 1994, the proportion of the population 65+ who were not disabled rose from 76.3 percent to 78.9 percent. This Maryland Office of Planning, Population Projections, June 1999 revisions.

Alternatives to Nursing Home Care 1. Public Image of Nursing Homes In addition to the challenges of financial uncertainties and quality concerns, nursing homes continue to face a public relations problem. In public opinion polls, many Americans say that they will go ""anywhere but a nursing home."" The American Health Care Association (AHCA), recognizing this issue, launched an initiative called ""SecureCare"" in 1997. While aimed at finance reform, it also tried to address the public relations problems in America's nursing homes. Again for the Year 2000, an area of concentration identified by AHCA is ""the generation of positive news stories"".12 At a local level, the Mid-Atlantic Non-Profit Health and Housing Association announced in its June 2000 newsletter that it wants to emphasize the positive in a new section entitled ""Beyond the Call of Duty""; its purpose is to ""be a step in countering the negative publicity that providers have endured from the mainstream press.""13 When nursing homes first emerged in the 1960s, they were viewed by some as ""places to die"". As the nursing home industry developed more of a medical model, and as hospitals discharged patients ""sicker and quicker"", nursing homes were able to develop more consumer confidence as they approached being ""mini hospitals"". If former HCFA Commissioner Bruce Vladek's opinion is any indication, nursing homes have a long way to go to improve their image: ""[nursing home] residents live out the last of their days in an enclosed society without privacy, dignity, or pleasure, subsisting on minimally palatable diets, multiple sedatives, and large doses of television---eventually dying, one suspects at least partially of boredom.""14 Alan Solomont, former Finance Chairman of the Democratic National Committee (""DNC"") and Co-Chair and Co-Chief Executive Officer of Solomont Bailis Ventures, predicts: ""long term care is not going to shrink, but it isn't going to grow at the same rate at which it did in the mid 90s."" He foresees an industry shakedown over the next year or so as providers shed debt accumulated during their expansion phase and compensate for decreased Medicare revenue growth. ""The industry is going to move back a few steps and once again focus on its core Medicaid business.""15 In the past, nursing homes had become the focus of the long-term care industry. Now, with a tremendous growth of home health, development of adult day care, and proliferation of assisted living, consumers have a wide range of alternatives from which to choose. ""Growth in spending for nursing home care decelerated steadily from 13.3 11  Liu, Korbin, Kenneth G. Manton, Cynthia Aragon. Changes in Home Care Use by Older People with Disabilities: 1982-1994.

Much of the deceleration in growth since 1990 was the result of slowing growth in medical price increases and expanded use of alternative treatment settings such as home health care, assisted living facilities, and community-based day care.""16 2. Home Health Care Services The Medicare home health program was started in 1965 as a humane concept of providing care for persons in their home and aiding recovery in a familiar environment. There were many reasons for an interest in home care including: ""reducing the financial burden of Medicaid nursing home spending on federal and state governments, the impoverishing consequences of the use of nursing homes by older people with disabilities, and the general preference of older people for home care."" 17The concept was popular, and, based on the ready availability of Medicare funding, the growth of home health services has been phenomenal. However, there is now serious concern with the rate of growth and its effects on Medicare spending nationally. Home health care reimbursements have grown by 300 percent nationally in the past six years alone.18 The rapid growth of home health care and its impact on the Medicare budget made the industry a focus of federal investigation. In 1995, a comprehensive anti-fraud initiative, Operation Restore Trust, was initiated. During this time, the Department of Health and Human Services' Inspector General and the General Accounting Office conducted investigations of certain states' home health agencies, finding various instances of inappropriate payment and cases of fraudulent behavior. In response to this, one focus of the Balanced Budget Act (""BBA"") was on the home health program with the intention to slow the rate of expenditure growth, provide incentives for efficiency in the delivery of care, and ensure that Medicare pays appropriately for services.19 Questions have been raised on the degree to which home health substitutes for nursing home care. To the extent that nursing homes provide long-term custodial care, home health probably does not substitute. However, as nursing homes increasingly serve more short-stay, post-acute and subacute patients discharged from hospitals, there is probably more overlap in their populations.

Assisted Living A study by Christine Bishop notes that an increasing number of nursing home residents are moving into alternative placements, such as assisted living, and she sees 16 17  Levit, Katherine, et. al. ""Health Spending in 1998: Signals of Change"", Health Affairs 19(1):1124-1342. Liu, Korbin et. al., ""Changes in Home Care Use by Older People with Disabilities: 1982-1994"", Public Policy Institute, AARP, January, 2000. 18 Havemann, Judith. ""Fraud is Rife in Home Care for the Elderly"". Washington Post, April 29,1997. 19 MHCC, Maryland Home Health Agency Statistical Profile: FY 1998 and Trend Analysis: FY 19961998, June, 2000.  13   these trends continuing. Some of the shift is due to the falling prevalence of disability. However, a greater influence is the preference for less institutional placement. This has resulted in lower utilization rates for nursing homes. Comparing data from the National Nursing Home Surveys, Bishop found that the percent of Americans 65 and older, who lived in nursing homes, fell from 4.6 percent in 1985 to 4.2 percent in 1995. 20 For Maryland, using more recent data, the percentage of the population aged 65 and over, who were residents of nursing homes fell from 4.14 percent in 1990 to 3.78 percent in 1997.21 Assisted living is also a growth industry. It is difficult to get an exact count of assisted living facilities since there is no single definition that is applied consistently nationwide. Regulations and licensure vary by state, and such facilities are often classified as domiciliary care, residential care, or personal care, etc. The Assisted Living Federation of America estimates that there were 362,014 assisted living beds in 1991, compared to 777,801 in 1999, a growth rate of over 114 percent.22 In Maryland, Dianne Dorlester, Executive Director of Maryland Assisted Living Association (MALA) estimates that there are currently 13,000 to 15,000 persons in 2,500 assisted living facilities in Maryland.23 Previously in Maryland, there were many types of residential programs governed by different regulations under different state agencies. Programs previously licensed under the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (domiciliary care), the Department of Human Resources (Project HOME), and the Office on Aging, now the Department of Aging, (sheltered housing) are now combined under the assisted living classification. Under regulations developed in July, 1998 in response to legislation passed in 1996, the Office of Health Care Quality now inspects and licenses all assisted living programs in Maryland. For an inventory of assisted living programs licensed by the Office of Health Care Quality, See Appendix D. 4. Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services Waiver for Older Adults The Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and the Maryland Department of Aging (""MDoA"") implemented the Senior Assisted Housing Waiver in 1993. In 1999, the Maryland General Assembly passed SB 593, which directed DHMH to expand the Senior Assisted Housing Waiver to cover services in all types of licensed assisted living facilities, as well as supportive services for individuals living at home. Under Medicaid rules, states can apply to the federal government to allow coverage of long term care in the community for certain populations through waivers. Without a waiver, only general nursing home service is covered. 20 21  Assisted Living Executive Report, Vol, 4, No. 4, February 16, 2000. Maryland Health Care Commission long term care survey data.

""Assisted Living Facilities: a Fast-Growing Niche for Developers, Architects, Builders"". Daily Record, February, 2000.  14   In an effort to enhance home and community-based services for older adults, on March 28, 2000, the federal Health Care Financing Administration (""HCFA"") issued a partial approval for major expansion of Maryland's current Senior Assisted Housing Waiver to provide a package of 16 home and community-based services for qualified older adults (aged 50 and older) who need nursing home level of care, but live at home or in a licensed assisted living facility. The original waiver provided services to 135 older adults. In order to qualify, individuals had to receive services in Senior Assisted Housing group homes certified by MDoA, meet certain Medicaid financial requirements, be at least 62 years old, be eligible for MDoA housing subsidies and for Medicare, live in certain jurisdictions, and be medically qualified for nursing facility level of care under the Medicaid program. The details of the proposed waiver expansion were developed by a workgroup that included representatives from other State and local agencies, advocacy organizations, providers, and provider organizations. HCFA denied the State's request to expand the waiver's medical eligibility to include individuals determined to be at risk for needing nursing facility services. The amended waiver, which has been renamed the Waiver for Older Adults, will cover 1,135 individuals in its first year and will expand to 5,135 individuals after five years, depending on budget appropriations. Effective in July 2000, the existing waiver was expanded statewide and the number of slots was increased. At the same time, DHMH and MDoA began putting new operational systems and regulations in place for the expanded services. Beginning in the fall of 2000, the State of Maryland will have regional training sessions for potential providers of new waiver services, and in November 2000 it will begin to process applications for new providers to participate. The regulations will be effective on January 1, 2001. During the upcoming months, the MDoA will continue to develop its database of information on companies and individuals that are interested in enrolling as service providers for the Medicaid Waiver for Older Adults. On January 1, 2001, the target population of individuals who Waiver for Older Adults will expand from those individuals at least individuals at least 50 years of age. New services will become provider types will be able to participate. Eligible participants will services in their homes or in large or small assisted living facilities. are eligible for the 62 years of age to available and new be able to receive  Administered by the local Area Agencies on Aging either directly or through contract with the local department of social services or local health department, the Waiver for Older Adults will target low income adults if they live at home or in a licensed assisted living facility and are:    At least 50 years of age; Have a monthly income of no more than $1,536.00 (300% of the Supplemental Security Income level); Have assets that are no more than $2,000.00 to $2,500.00, depending on eligibility category; and  15         Qualified for nursing facility level of care at the time of entry into the waiver, and reassessed at least every 12 months to need this level of care; Not enrolled at the same time in another Medicaid 1915(c) waiver, Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE), Rare and Expensive Case Management (REM), or any future Medicaid capitated managed care program that includes long term care; Living in any jurisdiction within the State of Maryland; Freely choosing between waiver or nursing facility services.  The waiver program must be able to assure the individual's health and safety and meet the individual's needs in a community-based setting. Regarding needs allowance and client contributions, effective 1/1/2001, an individual living at home will retain all of his/her income for personal and living expenses and will not pay towards the cost of waiver services. Further, an individual receiving the waiver's assisted living services may retain $60/month for personal needs and, at most, $420/month to pay the assisted living provider for room and board. The remainder of the individual's income must be paid to the assisted living provider for assisted living services. Each waiver participant may cost Medicaid no more in the community than Medicaid's average costs for nursing facility residents over the course of a year. Moreover, a lien may not be placed on a waiver participant's home. However, the State of Maryland may recover from the estate of a person over 55 years of age, who does not have a surviving spouse, an amount no more than Medicaid's payments for that person.

Each waiver participant receives a home visit and multidisciplinary assessment from the Adult Evaluation and Review Services (""AERS"")(formerly Geriatric evaluation services) under the local health department. AERS completes an assessment which is reviewed and signed by a physician and submitted to the Delmarva Foundation for Medical Care (DHMH's contractual utilization control agent) to determine whether the individual needs nursing facility level of care. While Delmarva evaluates medical eligibility for the waiver, using the assessment tool (DHMH Form 3871), a Central Office waiver unit at the Department of Human Resources (rather than the local department of social services) determines financial and technical eligibility for Medicaid and the waiver, based on DHMH instructions. An individual's waiver plan of care is developed by a team which includes at least the participant or legal representative, the waiver case manager, and the AERS social worker and nurse. The waiver plan of care preauthorizes waiver services, and assures that the individual costs Medicaid no more in the waiver annually than the individual would have cost Medicaid as a nursing facility resident. MDoA (or the area agency on aging if it is a public agency) approves an individual's waiver plan of care and any subsequent revisions. At least every three months, the waiver case manager makes a home visit and reviews the participant's waiver plan of care. At least every 12 months, the participant's waiver eligibility is redetermined. AERS reassesses the participant, and  25  Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services Waiver for Older Adults, Fact Sheet, distributed by Maryland Medical Care Programs July 20, 2000  17   Delmarva re-evaluates medical eligibility. The waiver plan of care is reviewed by the multidisciplinary team and revised as necessary.26 With Medicaid funding for what is now largely a private pay service, it would be expected that use of these facilities would increase at an even faster rate. In the future, there will be a need to collect data and monitor the growth of assisted living in Maryland in order to monitor its impact on the long term care system. Regarding the Waiver for Older Adults, DHMH is developing specifications for computer programming changes to monitor the waiver's administration. The development and increasing popularity of assisted living has made a significant impact on the financial stability of the nursing home industry. Though some of the decrease in utilization in nursing homes may be due to the falling prevalence of disability as well as changes in Medicare reimbursement, it is believed that shifts in utilization to other settings is a more important factor. Comparing National Nursing Home Survey data, the number of Americans 65 and older who lived in nursing homes fell from 4.6 percent in 1985 to 4.2 percent in 1995.27 The current rates may be even lower. 5. Medicaid Home and Community Services Waiver for Adults with Physical Disabilities (Attendant Care Waiver) Another service currently provided by Maryland's Medical Assistance Program is its Personal Care Program. This program reimburses for personal care services provided to chronically ill or disabled recipients who are under the care of a physician and require assistance at home with activities of daily living. The objectives of the program are to prevent patient deterioration, to delay institutionalization, and to prevent inappropriate institutionalization. The Attendant Care Waiver, with its current working title: Living at Home: Maryland Community Choices, will be effective April 1, 2001. Its goal is to secure a more consumer-responsive Medical Assistance Personal Care Program, and to create a personal assistance system for Medical Assistance recipients that is responsive, flexible, offers quality services, and develops partnerships. The Attendant Care Waiver is currently capped at 400 participants, aged 21-59, with 150 participating in the first year, 300 in the second year, and 400 in the third year. The philosophical foundation on which this particular waiver rests has two components. The first is one of self-determination. The Medical Assistance recipient has the right and responsibility to make his or her own decisions; to decide where he or she is going to live; to determine the utilization of resources under this waiver; and to participate fully and equally in the community. Secondly, this waiver is consumer   26  Specifications for Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services waiver for Older Adults as Expansion of the Senior Assisted Housing Waiver Per Senate Bill 593 (September 15, 2000), pages 1-2, 7. 27 Bishop, Christine, cited in Assisted Living Executive Report, Vol 4, No. 4, February 16, 2000.  18   directed, i.e. the individual will make decisions regarding the type and the amount of assistance or services he or she receives. The services available in the Living at Home: Maryland Community Choices to those 21-59 year olds who are residents of a nursing home, or are at risk for entry into a nursing home, will include the following:             Attendant Care Services Case Management Assistive Technology Consumer Training Durable Medical Equipment /Supplies Environmental Accessibility Adaptations Family-Training Skilled Nursing Supervision of Attendants Occupational Therapy Personal Emergency Response Systems Speech/Language Services Transportation  Provision of these services could have a significant impact on the utilization of nursing homes, and therefore on the nursing home bed need projections. Under this waiver, the participant will be able to use either one of two attendant care service models: agency-employed or consumer-employed, to secure services. To be eligible for the waiver, the participant's cost of care should be equal to or less than the participant's cost of care in a nursing home. Additionally, the waiver will have available State funding for services including a security deposit for a waiver participant's apartment, the purchase of household items, transportation, respite, mental health services, and heavy chore services. Non-Waiver Services not included in computing the waiver cost of care are those for Administration, Case Management, and the Fiscal Intermediary. Administration of the waiver will be under the auspices of the Department of Human Resources' Office of Personal Assistance Services, Case Management will be done regionally by local health departments, and the Fiscal Intermediary functions will also be done on a regional basis. Case Management functions will include assessment, planning, and enrollment coordination; ongoing case management such as service coordination and monitoring; and reassessments. Fiscal Intermediary functions will include payment processing, fiscal accounting, and reporting. The impetus for the State of Maryland's action in moving forward with this waiver was the July 1999 Supreme Court decision, Olmstead v. L.C. The Court's decision in that case clearly challenges federal, state, and local governments to develop more opportunities for individuals with disabilities through more accessible systems of cost-effective, community-based services. The Olmstead decision interpreted Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (""ADA"") and its implementing regulation, requiring states to administer their services, programs, and activities ""in the most integrated setting  19   appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities."" Medicaid and the waiver process can be important resources to assist the State in meeting these goals.28 Communications from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (""HHS"") to state governments leave no doubt that the federal agency, of which the Health Care Financing Administration, which administers the Medicaid Program, is a part, is interpreting Olmstead v. L.C. as covering any individual with a disability who lives in an institution, including a nursing home.29 The Attendant Care Waiver is a means for the State to create a plan to find the least restrictive environment for disabled individuals whether they are in nursing homes or are at risk for entering nursing homes. Because of the impact of the array of alternatives, many nursing homes have recognized that they must broaden their services for a chance to survive in the future. Many are branching out into other types of care in order to continue in operation, be financially viable, and to meet the needs and demands of a growing number of sophisticated, elderly who want more alternative services. The extent to which nursing homes are attempting to meet those requirements is shown by a survey conducted in 1997 by the American Health Care Association (AHCA) which found that its members offered several alternative services as follows: contract rehabilitation (26.5 percent); assisted living (21.7 percent); subacute (12.7 percent); adult day care (5.4 percent) home care (3.0 percent).30 For many years, nursing homes have had to face increasing competition from other models of care. These models, too, are now becoming more prevalent and more widely accepted. A few examples will be reviewed here: continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs); the Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE); and Social Health Maintenance Organizations (S/HMOs). 6. Continuing Care Retirement Communities Continuing care retirement communities as a model have existed in Maryland since the 1970s. CCRCs have grown from 14 in 1980 to 30 today (a growth rate of 114 percent). Now, twelve counties in Maryland are served by CCRCs, with a total of 2,350 nursing home beds. One of the appeals of CCRCs is that they offer an insurance model; that is, at least for the original type of CCRC model, a subscriber pays an entrance fee and monthly fees that cover all long term care services in exchange for a promise to provide a full range of care. The early CCRCs involved a transfer of assets. Many were church-sponsored and a prospective resident would have to give up his or her assets in exchange for lifetime care. The model then changed to continuing care, where a person paid an entrance fee and monthly fees and was guaranteed a full range of social, personal, nursing, and medical services, including nursing home care when needed. In order to 28  Health Care Financing Administration website ,www.hcfa.gov/medicaid/olmstead/olmshome.htm, August 29, 2000 29 The Supreme Court cautioned, however, that ""nothing in the ADA condones termination of institutional settings for persons unable to handle or benefit from community settings."" HFAM Networks, July/august 2000, p. 8. 30 HCIA and Arthur Andersen, The Guide to the Nursing Home Industry, 1998, p. x.  20   keep prices more competitive, many CCRCs offer an ""a la carte"" model where the person pays an entrance fee, but pays lower monthly fees for lower levels of care. Thus, a person can pay for an independent living unit for many years before experiencing an increase in fees for assisted living, nursing home, or other special services. Although CCRCs were always potentially competing with nursing homes for the same patient pool, especially those with the financial resources to privately pay, for the most part, the two groups had distinct roles. Mainly, nursing homes provided ""traditional"" custodial care or post acute care, while CCRCs provided housing with some health services. CCRCs need to receive both certification from the Department of Aging, and their nursing home beds must be approved by MHCC in one of two ways. First, a CCRC could obtain a CON, in which case it could serve the general public in those particular nursing home beds without restriction, the same as any other nursing home. Second, a CCRC can obtain an exclusion from CON review, which permits it to establish a prescribed number of comprehensive care beds, and serve only its own residents who have signed contracts to live in independent and assisted living units in that particular CCRC community. Recent legislation, passed during the 2000 legislative session, modified the CON statute as it applies to CCRCs. First, SB 403 modified the number of CON-excluded nursing home beds that a community may obtain. Under this new legislation, a CCRC with fewer than 300 independent living units would be able to obtain nursing home beds at 24 percent of the number of independent living units31; for communities with more than 300 independent living units, the 20 percent figure remains unchanged. This bill became effective October 1, 2000. In addition, SB 146 permits limited direct admission of persons from the general community into nursing home beds at CCRCs under the following circumstances: 1. The entrance fees paid prior to entering the community must be at least equal to the lowest entrance fee charged for an independent living unit or an assisted living unit. 2. The CCRC may admit a subscriber directly into a comprehensive care bed only if, at the time of admission, the subscriber has the potential for an eventual transfer to an independent living unit or an assisted living unit. This must be determined by the subscriber's personal physician, who is not an owner or employee of the CCRC. 3. The total number of comprehensive care beds occupied by subscribers who have been directly admitted from the general public may not exceed 20 percent of the total number of comprehensive care beds at that CCRC. 4. The CCRC must not admit a subscriber directly from the general community into a comprehensive care bed if that admission would cause the occupancy of the comprehensive care beds to exceed 95 percent.  31  Note: This computation does not include the number of assisted living units.  21   It should be noted that SB 146 sunsets on June 30, 2002. The Commission intends to collect data and carefully monitor the impact of this legislation, and the resulting regulations on both the CCRC and nursing home industries. Statewide, there are currently 30 CCRCs operating in Maryland. Twenty-six (26) of the 30 CCRCs operate their own nursing home facilities as a component of their services available on the campus of the community. As of March 8, 2000, those CCRCs operated a total of 7,618 independent living units, 1,591 assisted living units, and 2,350 nursing home beds. Of the CCRCs with nursing home facilities, 12 have received a CON exclusion for nursing home beds. The remaining 14 CCRCs have CON approved or grandfathered nursing home beds. As shown in Table 2, the 12 CCRCs with CON exclusions operate a total of 938 nursing home beds. More than one-half of those CON exempt nursing home beds are located in two CCRCs (Charlestown and Oak Crest Village) operated by Erickson Retirement Communities. In addition to facilities currently in operation, data maintained by the Department of Aging indicate that four new CCRCs are currentl y under development with a total of 539 additional nursing home beds. The development of CCRC nursing home beds, particularly with the recent expansion of direct admission, will have an intensified impact on the utilization of nursing home beds.

This program, which exists in some other states, provides some of the benefits of CCRCs while allowing individuals to stay in their own home. Basic services to be provided include:        Care coordination; Home inspection by an occupational therapist; Assistance with activities of daily living at home; Skilled nursing services at home; Services in assisted living; Services in comprehensive care facility; Assistance with home maintenance.  An individual would pay an entrance fee for services, with regular, periodic charges, co-payment, or a combination of funding arrangements. Regulations for Continuing Care at Home went into effect in Maryland May 15, 2000. The Department of Aging, which will regulate Continuing Care at Home, does not expect a large number of providers. As of this writing, MDoA estimates that it will receive three applications from prospective providers to initiate this service during the first year. 7. Program for All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) PACE, the Program for All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly, is a capitated managed care benefit for the frail elderly provided by a not-for-profit or public entity. PACE features a comprehensive medical and social delivery system using a multidisciplinary team approach in an adult day health center, supplemented by in-home and referral services in accordance with the participants' needs. It was originally based on a program in 1971 called On Lok Senior Health Services in San Francisco. This model provided a range of both acute and long-term care services to an enrolled community. This type of care expanded in 1986 when the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation provided funding for PACE demonstration sites to test if the model could be applied on a broader scale to many types of populations.32 The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 established PACE as a permanent entity within the Medicare program and has enabled States to provide PACE services to Medicaid beneficiaries as a state option. PACE beneficiaries need to be frail enough to satisfy their state's requirements for nursing home level of care. The BBA limits annual growth of the PACE program. The number of PACE agreements in the first year is 60 nationally; the limit increases by 20 each year thereafter.33 In January 1996, Hopkins Elder Plus initiated a pre-PACE site, which received partial Medicaid capitation for dual eligibles aged 65 and over who were certified for nursing facility level of care. A dual waiver proposal for full capitation by Medicare and 32 33  PACE information from HCFA WEBSITE: http://www.hcfa.gov/ Ibid.  23   Medicaid was jointly submitted to HCFA in June 1998 by The Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center. In January 1999, HCFA approved the waiver proposal, which was implemented in March 1999.34 8. Social Health Maintenance Organizations (S/HMOs) Social Health Maintenance Organizations (S/HMOs) are also based on early models and HCFA demonstration projects. An S/HMO is an organization that provides the full range of Medicare benefits offered by standard HMOs plus additional services which include: care coordination, prescription drug benefits, chronic care benefits covering short term nursing home care, a full range of home and community based services, such as homemaker, personal care services, adult day care, respite care, and medical transportation. Other services that may be offered include: eyeglasses, hearing aids, and prescription benefits. There were four original S/HMOs : Portland, Oregon; Long Beach, California; Brooklyn, New York; and La Vegas, Nevada. Each site has different requirements for premiums; persons do have to pay co-pays for certain services.35 In March 1998, HCFA approved Maryland's proposal for a planning grant to build on a Medicare HMO, develop a Second Generation S/HMO (S/HMO II) for Medicare-only and dually eligible (Medicare and Medicaid) older adults, and add longterm care and other services. A framework conference is being planned for the fall of 2000. HCFA approved a no-cost extension of the planning project through June 2001.36 A recent study found that S/HMO membership does not offer savings as expected. When comparing the expenditures of enrollees in the Minneapolis S/HMO with those in a TEFRA (Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982) HMO, results showed that outpatient services common to both the S/HMO and the TEFRA HMO were about 16 percent higher for S/HMO enrollees, and expenditures for all services were about 20 to 22 percent higher for S/HMO enrollees. The report does not indicate how costs compare to traditional care. The researchers speculate that health care providers might have discovered health problems that would otherwise have gone undetected, recommended medical attention for chronic problems, and helped to link patients with other medical providers, thus causing higher expenditures. E. Reimbursement  1. Maryland Medical Assistance Program (Medicaid) Although national attention often focuses on Medicare, the principal payer for nursing homes, both nationally and in Maryland, is the Medical Assistance Program, (""Medicaid""). In fiscal year 1998, Medicaid paid for 62.8 percent of total patient days in Maryland nursing homes. Although Medicaid is the principal payer for nursing home 34 35 36  Information from DHMH WEBSITE: http://www.dhmh.state.md.us/hsaea/ S/HMO information from Medicare Website: http://www.medicare.gov/ Information from DHMH Website, op. cit.  24   care, it should be noted that Medicaid is the payer of last resort, and pays only when the resident cannot pay. Also, residents must spend down and contribute nearly all pensions and other ongoing income to the cost of their care; they can keep $40 per month as a personal needs allowance. Since Medicaid is a joint federal-state program, the method of reimbursement varies from state to state. In Maryland, payment for nursing home services is based on the level of care required by each resident. It is thus a case-mix adjusted form of reimbursement. Such a methodology is designed to provide a greater incentive for nursing homes in Maryland to serve sicker residents and, on average, Maryland nursing home residents are more dependent in their activities of daily living (""ADLs"") than the national average. The American Health Care Association reports that residents of Maryland nursing homes had an average of 3.94 ADL dependencies as compared to 3.67 for the U.S.37 The current Medicaid reimbursement system for nursing homes in Maryland has been in effect since 1983. At that time, the objectives were to develop a system that was cost-related and administratively efficient, provided increased access for Medicaid residents, and encouraged quality care. Additional goals were to recognize fair market value of assets used, to recognize factors causing cost differences, and to include incentives for cost containment. There have been adjustments to the system since it was originally designed, but the basic structure has remained unchanged. The overall system design consists of four cost centers: administrative and routine, nursing service, other patient care, and capital. There are cost ceilings, with reimbursement of costs up to the ceilings and efficiency payments to facilities with costs below the ceilings. The ceiling and efficiency payments are adjusted as needed over time. Reimbursement is based on geographic regions, and includes a small facility class for administrative and routine costs. As Figure 3 indicates, this method of reimbursement has allowed the State to keep the percentage spent by Medicaid on nursing home care at a fairly stable level, even as the population has aged. Although aggregate spending on nursing homes by Medicaid has increased from $272,790,198 in FY 1990 to $559,140,121 in FY 1999, such spending as a percentage of total Medicaid spending has stayed fairly constant over time and actually decreased slightly.  37  American Health Care Association Nursing Facility Sourcebook, 1998  25   Figure 3 Spending on Nursing Homes as a Percentage of Total Medicaid Spending 25 20 Percentage 15 10 5 0 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 Years Source: Medicaid Year in Review, 1990-1997  Following recent investigations by the federal General Accounting Office into quality of care in nursing facilities nationwide, more attention has been drawn to improving quality of care issues in Maryland nursing homes by seeking to stabilize the nursing home work force. As noted above, the current Medicaid rate setting system for nursing facility services in Maryland was implemented on January 1, 1983. The reimbursement approach was intended to provide sufficient payment to enable nursing homes to provide quality care, include incentives for cost efficiency, and create a healthy business climate for nursing home operators. Numerous modifications and updates have been adopted since that time, but the basic methodology is essentially unchanged. The Medicaid Program has also imposed adjustments to various parameters for cost containment purposed. Since 1992, a prescribed ""cycle-down"" method has been used to achieve specific amounts of payment reductions in order to meet budget constraints. Reductions have totaled as much as $35 million a year. Although funds have been made available to restore much of these cuts during recent years, reductions of $9.5 million remained in effect as late as Fiscal Year 1999, the latest data available.  26   In addition, the Medicaid Program's work measurement formula for nursing services in nursing homes, which is intended to ensure that payment for services accurately reflects the time and staff mix required to provide the services, has not been updated since Fiscal Year 1993. Medicaid Program regulations require that the formula be re-calibrated at least every five years, but due to lack of funding to adopt the results of the most recent work measurement study, amendments have been approved for each of the past two years to postpone this requirement. The Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (the ""Department"") had projected in its Nursing Home Reimbursement Study dated December 1, 1998, the latest available, that implementation of the study results would increase nursing service payments by $23 million in Fiscal Year 2000. The cumulative impact of the cost containment reductions from January 1991 through Fiscal Year 1999 was $188.5 million, and delay in implementation of the work measurement study results during the past two years has had an additional impact of $43 million. However, even with these cuts in effect, the Department noted that per diem reimbursement rates have increased by an average of 5.3 percent annually during this time. The Department also noted that the number of licensed nursing home beds had increased by 12.5 percent during this same period.38 In responding to the cost containment reductions made by the Department, the Health Facilities Association of Maryland (""HFAM""), estimated that the total lost revenue resulting from the State's failure to fund the work measurement study for five years was about $100 million, and the total impact of the reductions through restoration in FY 2000 was close to $300 million. In a letter to the Commission, HFAM noted that the 1994 work measurement study, which was conducted by the Department to determine the time and staff mix for nursing services, showed that nursing time had increased due to the more medically complex resident mix entering nursing homes. In the absence of increased Medicaid reimbursement, nursing homes were forced to postpone needed capital improvements. Additionally, lenders informed nursing homes that they were less willing to loan money due to the inadequate Medicaid reimbursement. According to HFAM, the payment reductions during most of the 1990s left Maryland nursing homes, particularly those with high percentages of Medicaid residents, ill prepared to weather the impact of managed care, the staffing crisis, loss of private pay patients, decreasing occupancies resulting from competition from assisted living facilities, and the cuts in Medicare reimbursement under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. 39 In response to these concerns raised by the State's nursing home industry, 2000 Maryland General Assembly adopted Senate Bill 794, which called for the convening of the Nursing Home Reimbursement Study Group. The bill requires that state budget include $10 million in General Funds for Fiscal Year 2002 (beginning J 1, 2001), and an additional $10 million in Fiscal Year 2003, to increase payments in 38 39  the rethe uly the  Nursing Home Reimbursement Study, December 1, 1998, pages 1-2 August 4, 2000 Letter to the Commission from Ann L.

The additional funds are to be used to enable nursing homes to address the recommendations of the Task Force on Quality of Care in Nursing Homes. The goals of the Study Group are to:    Review the existing reimbursement formula to ensure it reflects the current and planned requirements of the nursing home program under Medicaid and the care needs of the nursing home residents; Review the proposed funding appropriation for Fiscal Year 2002 and Fiscal Year 2003, and make recommendations for changes to the reimbursement formula to ensure that the intent of the law is achieved; and Report its findings to the General Assembly by December 1, 2000.  The Study Group operated with participation from representatives from the nursing home industry, the Service Employees International Union, and State agencies. The Study Group's principles and recommendations, none of which require new legislation or additional funding, are as follows: Study Group Principles:    Providers should retain flexibility to use funds for any combination of increased staffing or higher wages. Any changes to the reimbursement methodology should maximize the potential for providers to use the new funds in a fashion consistent with the legislation. All new funding should be acuity-based.  The recommended changes to the reimbursement formula are maximally consistent with the principals above. Study Group Recommendations:      Employ ""dual rate-setting"" to ensure that new funds are not used as profit. Revise the methodology for the calculation of FY 2003 rates. Delay work measurement survey until Summer, 2003. Alter the cost reporting schedule to avoid an ""average cost penalty."" Establish a one time, two year cost settlement period.40  2. Medicare Program Although a small proportion of nursing home care is reimbursed by Medicare, it is a major payer for short term and subacute care. Until the passage of the Balanced Budget Act, nursing homes enjoyed a system of reimbursement from Medicare which essentially reimbursed whatever they billed, usually a fee based on their costs of care (""reasonable costs""), subject to ceilings adjusted for urban or rural locations. Nursing homes were 40  Medicaid Nursing Home Reimbursement Study Group, Draft Report, September 29, 2000, p.2.  28   paid an interim rate, subject to final cost settlement. Although Medicare represents a fairly small proportion of care provided overall in nursing homes (9.3 percent nationally in 1998, as reported by the American Health Care Association), with an increasingly sick patient population, more facilities started to offer skilled nursing care. According to the Health Care Financing Administration (""HCFA""), the percentage of total nursing facility expenditure attributable to Medicare more than tripled from $2.8 billion in 1992 to $10.2 billion in 1997.41 Since Medicare focuses on paying for post acute care (following a hospitalization) with a limit of up to 100 days, facilities have tried to maximize their Medicare reimbursement by focusing on the provision of skilled care and by developing Medicare distinct part units. Several hospitals and nursing homes also started providing subacute (short-term, post-acute) care as a way of maximizing reimbursements from Medicare. As will be discussed in the next section, this reliance on this source of funding became a major problem for these facilities when Medicare changed its reimbursement methodology with the enactment of the Balanced Budget Act. In Maryland, as shown in Figure 4, payer source on admission attributable to Medicare grew from 10 percent of residents in 1990 to 29 percent in 1997.

Provider, November, 1999.  29   Nationally, Medicare spending in skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) grew from $578 million in 1986 to $13.6 billion in 1998.42 At the same time, Medicare costs for home health were increasing at an even faster rate. From 1987 to 1994, combined Medicare and Medicaid outlays for long-term care rose by 153 percent for nursing homes and 543 percent for home health care.43 As a result, the federal government felt that it needed to take drastic action to stop this spiral of increasing costs. 3. Balanced Budget Act of 1997 A significant change to the operation of nursing homes occurred with the enactment of the Balanced Budget Act (""BBA"") of 1997. As part of the overall effort to balance the federal budget, Congress passed and the President signed the BBA, which was intended to reduce Medicare payments in 1999 from $248 billion to $232 billion. However, the Congressional Budget office estimated that actual payments for 1999 were only $210 billion.44 HCFA began phasing in Medicare prospective payment for skilled nursing facilities over four years, beginning July 1, 1998; however, final rules governing the Medicare skilled nursing PPS were not available until July 30, 1999. During the first year, 75 percent of a facility's Medicare payment would be based on its maximum allowable 1995 costs, adjusted for inflation, with 25 percent based on the national PPS rate. Thereafter, the ratio changed to 50:50 for the second year, 25:75 in the third, and 100 percent PPS rate by the fourth year.45 Under the BBA, instead of a reimbursement rate based on ""reasonable"" costs, SNFs receive a set payment for each day of care provided to a Medicare beneficiary. The per diem rate was initially based on the average daily rate of providing all Medicarecovered skilled nursing services in 1995. Since not all patients require the same intensity of care, a case mix adjustment factor was incorporated, permitting some flexibility in the payment calculation. PPS is based on a case mix system of Resource Utilization Groups (""RUG""), which combines routine, ancillary, and capital costs into an all-inclusive case mix-adjusted rate. RUGs are based on data from the resident assessment instrument called the Minimum Data Set (MDS) 2.0. The rate also includes wage adjustments based on geographic variations, using the hospital wage index. Hospital swing beds and lowvolume skilled nursing facilities (with fewer than 1500 patient days per year) are not subject to these Medicare PPS rates until 2000.46  42 43  Salganik, M. William.

There was an equalization of rates between freestanding and hospital-based SNFs with rates all inclusive of routine, capital, and ancillary costs. Payment based on resource utilization groups (RUGs): RUGs have been tested and developed in several phases. These are called RUGs III, representing the third iteration of RUGs. The PPS system is based on 44 RUGs groupings. Therapy Services Caps: Beginning in 1999, the BBA caps Part B rehabilitation services. There is a cap of $1,500 per year on occupational therapy and a combined cap of $1,500 per year on speech therapy and physical therapy. * Transfer and discharge: By treating the movement of a patient from a PPS hospital to a SNF or home health agency as a transfer rather than a discharge, the BBA intended to save an estimated $1.3 billion. This reduces the DRG by paying a blended DRG/per diem rate if the patient is moved early from a group of the 10 most frequently used DRGs. Consolidated billing: SNFs will bill for all covered services provided to residents under Part B with payment being made to the SNF (except physician and physician-related services). * Repeal of the Boren Amendment: This amendment, enacted in 1980, required that states set Medicaid rates for nursing facilities that are reasonable and adequate to meet mandated federal standards for quality care. This provision of the BBA repealing the Boren Amendment was effective October 1, 1997 No Block Grants: All Medicaid services, including nursing facility services, remain as an entitlement for the poor and disabled. There are no block grants or per capita grants. Asset transfers: Those who provide legal counsel or assistance in helping a person to knowingly dispose of assets to become eligible for Medicaid can be prosecuted.47              After the enactment of the BBA, many nursing homes, subacute care providers, and others complained to HCFA that the cuts were too drastic. Several long term care companies declared bankruptcy. The American Health Care Association, the American Association of Homes and Services to the Aging, and others lobbied against provisions of the BBA with a major advertising and letter writing campaign. The final result was an adjustment to the BBA called the Medicare, Medicaid and State Children's Health Insurance Program Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999. This is often referred to as the ""BBA Refinement Act"".  47  American Health Care Association (AHCA) Briefing Room, ""1997 Federal Budget Act Will Change LTC"", August 27, 1997. WEBSITE: http://www.ahca.org/ * This item was modified under The Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999.  31   The Medicare, Medicaid and State Children's Health Insurance Program Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 Highlights  A 6 month add-on to the RUGs III categories: There would be a 20% add-on for six months (beginning April 12, 2000) to more accurately account for non-therapy ancillary costs for 12 RUGs categories.

The option for facilities to go directly to the full federal reimbursement rate, effective with a cost reporting period on or after January 1, 2000. Exclusions from the prospective payment system for certain prosthetics, certain chemotherapy, and for ambulance services for dialysis patients, starting April 1, 2000. Provisions for Part B add-ons for facilities participating in certain demonstration projects and for those who serve a high proportion of AIDS patients in 2000-2001. A 2-year moratorium on implementing the Part B therapy caps and revises the BBA mandated study to develop an alternative system for therapy services payments.48        Although these refinements attempt to modify the severity of the initial BBA, the concept of prospective payment and reduction in Medicare payments is still in place. The notion of retrospective payment to cover all or most expenses has been eliminated. This has resulted in, and will continue to require, a major shift in the mindset of long-term care providers. 4. Bankruptcy Among Nursing Home Chains Because of the major changes in nursing home reimbursement described above, many long-term care companies have merged, or declared bankruptcy, filing under Chapter 11 which gives a company the opportunity to negotiate better interest rates on its debt and streamline its operations by, among other things, shedding unprofitable businesses. Filing for bankruptcy protection provides a company with an automatic stay, preventing the company's creditors from taking any action to collect debt or foreclose on collateral.49 According to the American Health Care Association, (AHCA), 1,675 skilled nursing facilities out of 17,000 (or about 10 percent) nationally have declared bankruptcy. During the past six months, there were perhaps more bankruptcies among major longterm care providers than at any other time. The most notable of these are listed in Table 3.  48 49  Mid-Atlantic Nonprofit Health and Housing Association (MANPHA) Newsletter, December, 1999, p. 2. Vickery, Kathleen.

""Health Care Companies say Federal Cuts Hurt Industry"". The Baltimore Sun, February 3, 2000, p. D-1 and Provider, June, 2000.  Of those listed in Table 3, Vencor, Sun, and Mariner are large national chains. Lenox, Frontier, Newcare, and HMU are smaller, more localized firms. It should be noted that although Integrated Health Care had its headquarters in Maryland, it has no Maryland facilities. Integrated Health Services, which made numerous facility acquisitions in anticipation of less severe cuts, grew to 84,000 employees with $3.0 billion in annual revenue. The company just built a new headquarters in Maryland's Hunt Valley area of Baltimore County, financed in part by the State ($2.5 million) and Baltimore County ($800,000). It had $1.0 billion in equity and $3.0 billion in debt. Companies that have merged or declared bankruptcy have cited the changes in Medicare reimbursement as the source of their financial woes. Although it is true that the drastic changes in the form of a prospective payment system did cause serious downturns with these markets, this was an announced, anticipated change, which many other companies managed to weather. The ones that were the most severely impacted were heavily invested in Medicare post-acute products, had over expanded the number of their sites, and were also heavily in debt. Most of the losses were due to ""one-time transactions, including cost restructuring and the writing down of assets.""51 The bankruptcy woes seemed to hit the larger chains harder than some of the smaller nursing homes providing more ""traditional"" types of nursing care. ""Some nursing homes, particularly those that belong to large chains, had increased their profitability by expanding into ancillary services, thus increasing their volume of Medicare subacute patients. Adding these services often required borrowing capital, placing the homes in a debt situation that is hard to reverse when revenues decline. Also, the PPS system placed limits on reimbursement for ancillary services, for which these 51  Adams, ""Medicare: New Rules Make Nursing Home Admission Harder"". Wall Street Journal, December 23, 1999.  33   entities had signed contracts, so these homes are now being hit even harder than most. Indeed, the stock prices of some of the large chains demonstrate their strain--in 1998, the stock prices of the eight largest publicly traded subacute and long-term care companies fell by an average of 56.7 percent. The second worst year, historically was 1988, when the drop was only 10 to 15 percent.""52 So, it appears reasonable to assume that a combination of factors and actions caused the financial situation for these companies. Regardless of the root cause, the bankruptcies of nursing home chains may well have an impact not only on the nursing home system, but also on the broader health care system. If nursing homes, due to fears of BBA impact, refuse to take complex medical and rehabilitation patients, such patients will be backed up in hospitals. If home health agencies are undergoing a budget crisis at the same time, this will also put pressure on hospitals. Due to pressure from managed care organizations, hospitals are also more rapidly discharging patients at higher acuity levels; this is putting pressure on the entire health care system, and especially on the patients whom no one seems to consider. Although much has been written about the draconian effects of the BBA, Maryland appears to have been spared some of the negative consequences. This is due, in part, to the fact that it has long had a case-mix adjusted Medicaid reimbursement system. Such a system provides greater incentives for facilities to accept sicker Medicaid patients than a flat rate reimbursement system. Thus, in general, facilities are less dependent on Medicare here than elsewhere. To better gauge the impact of the BBA in Maryland, HCFA is currently participating with four other peer review organizations on the Skilled Nursing Facility Prospective Payment System Quality Medical Review Pilot Project. The Maryland team is comprised of The Delmarva Foundation for Medical Care (""Delmarva""), the Maryland Office of Health Care Quality, Maryland Medicare/Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Maryland, and the Medical Care Finance and Compliance Administration of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Delmarva developed a questionnaire that was distributed to consumers, providers, trade organizations and other interested organizations and returned with a 32 percent response rate. Results included the following findings:     52  54 percent responded that since the implementation of PPS, staffing in nursing homes has declined; there is a 45 percent increase in use of agency nurses. Skilled Nursing Facilities (""SNFs"") did not report any increase in patient falls, episodes of patient dehydration, or acquisition of pressure ulcers. SNFs noted a 67 percent increase in patient acuity and 68 percent have made admission requirements more stringent. 62 percent of the hospitals reported an increase in readmissions from SNFs.  HCIA Guide, 1999.  34     76 percent of hospitals report an increase in length of stay for patients awaiting SNF placement.53  It should be noted that these are preliminary findings and that replies represent only a 32 percent response rate. Further data and results from this study are expected later this year. 5. Nursing Home Mergers/Acquisitions in Maryland Mergers of long term care facilities in Maryland have occurred with increasing frequency in recent years. This may be due in part to the BBA, since mergers can consolidate billing and other administrative expenses, but it may also just be a sign of the times where it is much more difficult for smaller nursing homes to survive. The chains, both national and local, that operate more than one facility in Maryland, are listed in Table 4. As this table indicates, 10,839 beds out of the statewide total 30,300 (or 36 percent) are operated by owners of seven multi-facility chains in Maryland.

Some of it has been related to changes in ownership of the facility, changes in who owns the license, or both. More recently, mergers and acquisitions have been the result of corporate restructuring. These activities, which have increased from a total of 18 facilities in 1997 to 39 in 1999, are illustrated in Figure 5.  53  Rodgers, Roxanne, Delmarva Foundation.

Quality of Care 1. Federal Quality of Care Initiatives  Nursing homes have suffered in the past few years from the simultaneous cuts in reimbursement coinciding with increased scrutiny in areas of quality of care. For context and perspective on the impact of these changes, one needs to have a brief history of the quality of care initiatives that have been launched in this area.  36   Federal Quality of Care Initiatives:  1986: The Institute of Medicine conducted a study of nursing home regulations and reported prevalent problems regarding the quality of care and the need for stronger federal regulations. 1987: The General Accounting Office (GAO) reported that over one third of nursing homes are operating below federal minimum standards. This led to the passage of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA of 1987). Part of OBRA 1987 was the comprehensive Nursing Home Reform Act (PL 100-203), which included, among other things, the development of the minimum data set (MDS). 1991: HCFA's OSCAR (Online Survey Certification and Reporting System) came online in October 1991. It listed reports for 3 previous surveys. 1995: The Nursing Home Reform Act led to new enforcement provisions outlined in the State Operations Manual (SOM) in July 1, 1995. A new HCFA certification process also began in 1995. The Ombudsman Program, which was created in 1978 under the Older Americans Act, developed the NORS (National Ombudsman Reporting System) in 1995. 1997: In 1997, the Office of the Inspector General (OIG), in a report entitled ""Safeguarding Long Term Care Residents"", reported great diversity in ways that states investigate patient abuse. A more in-depth audit of Maryland facilities examined eight nursing homes and found that 5% of employees had criminal records. 1998: In March 1998, Charlene Harrington published a study entitled: ""The Regulation and Enforcement of Federal Nursing Home standards"". She challenged the declining State deficiency averages by raising the notion that the enforcement process may be weakening rather than nursing facilities improving their quality of care. In July 1998, President Clinton announced new nursing home initiatives to provide enhanced protections and to target needed improvements in nursing home care. He called on HCFA to impose penalties on nursing facilities without establishing a grace period, inspect facilities with poor records more frequently, and establish a national databank so consumers could compare facilities against one another. Following his recommendation, HCFA granted states greater latitude to impose fines as high as $10,000 per survey infraction, eliminated grace periods for facilities with repeated violations, and pushed states to begin criminal investigations of complaints about harm to residents within 10 days. Also, in 1998, the GAO report on quality of care in 1,370 California nursing homes revealed that 30% had violations that caused death or lifethreatening harm to residents, or had understated the frequency of poor care by falsifying medical records. This led to hearings held during the summer of 1998 by the Senate Special Committee on Aging. 1999: In March 1999, the OIG released a report entitled: ""Quality of Care in Nursing Homes: An Overview"". Among its findings: 13 out of 25 ""quality of care"" deficiencies have increased in recent years; ombudsman complaints have been steadily increasing; since 1995 the OIG has excluded 668 nursing home workers from participation in the Medicare/Medicaid program as a result of a conviction related to patient abuse or neglect. Recommendations include: enhance the survey and certification process; strengthen the ombudsman program; improve nursing home staffing levels; improve coordination between state survey agencies and ombudsman; a systematic assessment of OBRA 1987; and create periodic report cards on conditions in nursing homes. Also in March 1999, the GAO released a report entitled: ""Additional Steps Needed to Strengthen Enforcement of Federal Quality Standards."" They found that more than one fourth of the nursing homes studied had deficiencies that caused actual harm to residents, or placed them at risk of death or serious injury. Furthermore, sanctions initiated by HCFA were never implemented in a majority of cases, and generally there was no mechanism to ensure that the homes maintained compliance with standards. Recommendations include: improve the effectiveness of civil money penalties; strengthen the use of and effect of termination; improve the referral process (referral to HCFA for sanction); develop better management information systems. In the summer of 1999, HCFA added 24 quality indicators to its survey process for Medicare-certified facilities. Facilities receive a percentile rank for each indicator that shows how the facility compares with others in the state. Facilities with an unfavorable rank will face more scrutiny by state surveyors, particularly in the area of concern. Also, HCFA will now place immediate sanctions on any facility that receives two consecutive survey citations for isolated incidents that involve actual harm to at least one resident.54  Office of the Inspector General, Quality of Care in Nursing Homes: An Overview, March 1999 (OEI-02-99-00060). Also General Accounting Office, Nursing Homes: Additional Steps Needed to Strengthen Enforcement of Federal Quality Standards, March, 1999 (GAO/HEHS-99-46).  54   2.  State Quality of Care Initiatives  At the same time as these federal initiatives have occurred, the State of Maryland has also launched its own quality of care investigation. Senate Bill 740 and House Bill 791, passed during the 1999 General Assembly, required the creation of a Task Force on Quality of Care in Nursing Facilities. The bill also called for reform of Medicaid's reserve bed payment policy and establishment of a nursing home report card to be prepared by the Maryland Health Care Commission. This was done as a result of two developments: growing recognition that nursing homes were severely understaffed resulting in a decline of quality of care, and issues raised by the March 1999 federal General Accounting Office (""GAO"") report which severely criticized Maryland's regulatory oversight of the nursing home industry. Findings of the GAO Report include findings that Maryland:      dedicated fewer resources to investigating complaints than other states surveyed; recorded substantially fewer complaints than Michigan or Wisconsin, two other states surveyed by the GAO on this particular matter; generally classified similar complaints as needing less prompt investigation; did not meet the assigned time frames for investigating many complaints; and had a large backlog of uninvestigated cases and poor tracking of the status of investigations.  The GAO report found, ""as a consequence, serious complaints alleging that nursing home residents are being harmed can remain uninvestigated for weeks or months in Maryland. Such delays can prolong situations in which residents may be subject to abuse or neglect resulting in serious care problems like malnutrition and dehydration, preventable accidents, and medication errors.""55  General Accounting Office. Nursing Homes Complaint Investigation Processes in Maryland. June, 1999. (GAO/T-HEHS-99-146)  55   The Maryland Nursing Home Task Force met from July to December of 1999. It included public comments from all major stakeholders, and issued the following findings:        Nursing home residents have more complex and acute medical needs than in previous decades. Personal care needs of residents are not being met. There has been a decline in the quality of care in Maryland's nursing homes. Nursing Assistants, who provide most of the care in the homes, are in a position with little mobility, limited opportunity, and poor pay. The result is large turnover in these positions and continued staff shortages. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 reduced federal reimbursement to nursing homes. The 1998 federal nursing home initiatives (NHIs) have had a major resource impact on Maryland's regulatory system. This impact is compounded by the Office of Health Care Quality's (OHCQ) difficulty in recruiting qualified survey staff. In response to the GAO report and new directives from HCFA, OHCQ has made complaint investigation a higher priority. State licensure laws for enforcing action against nursing homes with poor quality of care are not effective. These laws do not lead to early intervention and the encouragement of nursing homes to achieve and maintain compliance with standards. At present, enforcement action for nursing homes with poor quality is dependent on federal regulations. Maryland nursing homes are not practicing internal health quality assurance and as a result are less proactive in dealing with issues. Advocacy efforts on behalf of nursing home residents are underfunded and need to be strengthened. In particular, the long-term care ombudsman program does not have the resources to do its job. Family Councils can be a valuable source of advocacy for residents, provided that they operate independently of nursing home administration.      Recommendations from the Maryland Nursing Home Task Force included:   Continue the Task Force as an oversight committee to monitor progress on the implementation of its recommendations. Increase minimum staffing standards for resident care in nursing homes to four hours per resident per day, with unlicensed direct care staffing set at a minimum of three hours per resident per day. Improve the quality of the nursing home workforce. Strengthen State regulation of nursing homes.     39      Improve quality assurance programs in nursing homes. Strengthen consumer advocacy, including the long-term care ombudsman program.  Another provision of SB 740 required that the Maryland Health Care Commission, in consultation with the DHMH and the Department of Aging, to ""develop and implement a system to comparatively evaluate the quality of care and performance of nursing facilities on an objective basis"". The Commission formed a Nursing Home Report Card Steering Committee to develop nursing home report cards. In May 2000, this Steering Committee issued a Request for Proposal (""RFP"") for bids on the development of a work plan for a conceptual model report card. An Evaluation Committee, a subcommittee of the Steering Committee with the addition members of Commission Staff, was formed to evaluate the bids. The Evaluation Committee agreed, by consensus, that the overall proposal submitted by ABT Associates, Inc. (""ABT"") provided the most advantageous offer to the State of Maryland. The Commission is required to make a progress report on the nursing home evaluation system to the General Assembly by January 1, 2001, and the evaluation system must be implemented on or before July 1, 2001. During the 2000 session of the General Assembly, quality of care in nursing homes was again a major focus of activity. Following the work of the Maryland Nursing Home Task Force, seven bills addressing quality concerns were considered, and six passed. Briefly described, these bills included the following provisions:56  HB 784/SB 794: $40 million added to the Medicaid budget over the next two years to support increased staffing in nursing homes. A provision increasing staffing requirements to 4.0 nursing hours per day was defeated. HB 747/SB 690: Requires nursing homes to create a quality assurance program, a quality assurance committee, a written quality assurance plan; requires facilities to post staffing ratios. HB 634/SB 689: Provides authority to the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to impose sanctions and penalties, including civil money penalties, instead of just relying on federal sanctions and penalties. HB 748/SB 698: Continues the Nursing Home Task Force as an oversight body. HB 749/SB 688: Requires DHMH to conduct two full inspections each year unless a facility has been deficiency-free in two consecutive surveys.         56  Appendix B contains a more detailed synopsis of these legislative measures.  40     HB 865: Authorizes a budget increase of $1.9 million over the next three years, to expand the State's long term care ombudsman program.  Another effort in the area of quality of care in nursing homes is a joint program of the Mid-Atlantic Non-Profit Health and Housing Association (MANPHA), the Maryland Medical Directors Association (MMDA) and the Health Facilities Association of Maryland (HFAM), to develop clinical practice guidelines for use in nursing homes. The Maryland Office of Health Care Quality will recognize use of these guidelines as an initiative under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (""OBRA"") regulations.  41   III.  GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT OF NURSING FACILITY SERVICES IN MARYLAND  Government oversight of nursing homes, including facilities, staff, and program operation, is principally the responsibility of six agencies: the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's Office of Health Care Quality and the Medical Care Programs (""Medicaid""), the Board of Physician Quality Assurance (""BPQA""), the Board of Nursing, and the Maryland Health Care Commission (""MHCC""), and the Maryland Department of Aging (""MDoA"") . Although this report focuses on the oversight responsibilities of the MHCC and the options for potential changes in regulation, for context and perspective, it is important to consider how nursing home services are regulated by other agencies of state government. The history of nursing homes in the United States has been one of constant change. Starting in the 1960s with the passage of Medicare and Medicaid as a source of reimbursement, nursing homes evolved from old age ""rest homes"" to major providers who offered an increasingly medical model of care. With the enactment of prospective payment for hospitals in the 1980s, nursing homes found themselves taking care of increasingly more medically complex patients as hospitals discharged patients ""sicker and quicker"". The development of alternatives to nursing homes in the 1980s and 1990s and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 further increased the turmoil for nursing homes as they struggled to redefine their mission. For more details on the evolution of government policy initiatives relating to nursing homes and the general long term care system in Maryland, see Appendix A. A. Department of Health and Mental Hygiene  Demographic, social, and economic changes have prompted the federal government and State of Maryland, through their agents noted below, to address issues related to nursing homes since the implementation of Medicaid, Medicare, and the Older Americans Act in 1965. 1. Office of Health Care Quality The Office of Health Care Quality (""OHCQ""), an administration within the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (""DHMH""), is responsible for overseeing the quality of care and compliance with both state and federal regulations in health-related institutions in Maryland, including nursing homes. The Long Term Care Unit of OHCQ is responsible for licensing all nursing homes and certifying them for participation in Medicare and/or Medicaid. COMAR 10.07.02.05A requires nursing homes to be open at all times for ""inspection by the Secretary of Health and Mental Hygiene, or by any agency designated by the Secretary."" OHCQ is also responsible for licensing Assisted Living facilities and Adult Day Care Centers. In addition, OHCQ investigates quality of  42   care complaints from the general public and those referred by the State's insurance commissioner. In a cooperative partnership with the Health Care Financing Administration (""HCFA""), the Medical Care Finance and Compliance Administration of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, Maryland Medicare/Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Maryland (the Medicare fiscal intermediary), and the Delmarva Foundation for Medial Care, the OLCQ has joined in the HCFA Skilled Nursing Facility Prospective Payment System Quality Medical Review Pilot Project (""SNF PPS QMR Pilot Project""). This project, which described in Part II, is testing a data driven and cooperative quality medical review approach to assess, monitor, and improve the quality of Medicare skilled nursing facility services under the Prospective Payment System. 2. Maryland Medical Care Program (Maryland Medicaid)  Under the Maryland Medical Assistance Program (""Medicaid""), nursing home services are covered for medically and financially eligible Medicaid recipients. A recipient must be certified by the Program's Utilization Control Agent, the Delmarva Foundation for Medical Care, as requiring health related services above the level of room and board which can be provided only through institutional services. In fiscal year 1998, the most recent date for which data are available, services were provided in 205 nursing facilities statewide. This represents approximately 77.07 percent of the 266 licensed nursing homes in Maryland in 1998.57 As noted above, nursing facility reimbursement rates are set by the Medicaid Program using a system originally developed in fiscal year 1983, but refined further since that time. Under this reimbursement methodology, separate rates are set for four cost centers and are based on the size, geographic location, and expenditures of each nursing facility. These cost centers are: administrative/routine services, nursing services, other patient care, and capital costs. Payment for nursing services is based on the level of care required by each patient. According to an analysis provided by DHMH, the Medicaid Program's average per diem payment for nursing home services was $85.72 in fiscal year 1998, the most recent date for which data are available. This average per diem represents an increase of 8.5 percent from the fiscal year 1997 average of $78.97. Payment from patients' own resources and collections in fiscal year 1998 accounted for an average of $20.90, 5.0 percent higher than the average of $19.91 in fiscal year 1997. Additional oversight of nursing home admissions is in the form of the Statewide Evaluation and Planning Services (""STEPS""), a pre-admission screening program for which Medical Assistance reimburses providers for conducting long term care evaluations. These comprehensive evaluations are conducted by licensed social workers and registered nurses working in Adult Evaluation and Review Services (""AERS""), 57  This figure represents comprehensive beds in both nursing homes and continuing care retirement centers.  43   formerly the Geriatric Evaluation Services (""GES""), located in local health departments and include medical/nursing, psychological and functional assessments. Following each evaluation, this multidisciplinary team develops an individualized plan of care which recommends services that could appropriately substitute for nursing facility care and enable the individual to remain in the least restrictive environment. The Medical Assistance Program pays for the STEPS evaluation and multidisciplinary assessment for an individual who is determined to be financially and medically eligible. Financial eligibility includes a Medical Assistance recipient or a person who would be able to establish financial eligibility for Medical Assistance within six months, if admitted to a nursing facility. Medical eligibility is for a person who is certified by the Department or its designee as requiring nursing facility level of care, or a person who is at risk of needing nursing home services. In fiscal year 1997, STEPS providers were reimbursed $275 per evaluation for 11,439 completed evaluations, totaling $3,145,725. In addition, in January 1989, the State was mandated to implement Pre-admission Screening and Annual Resident Review (""PASARR"") under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (""OBRA 87""). The act requires pre-admission screening and annual resident review of individuals with mental illness or mental retardation and related conditions who are applicants to, or residents of, Medicaid certified nursing homes. These individuals are evaluated by the AERS teams located in the local health departments. The teams are composed of nurses, social workers, psychiatrists and psychologists. If an individual's needs cannot be met in the community, the team evaluates whether the individual requires the level of services provided by a nursing home, and if specialized services are needed. A plan of care that recommends appropriate services for each individual is developed in a multidisciplinary setting. Upon review of the recommendations, the State Mental Hygiene Administration makes determinations for individuals with mental illness and the State Developmental Disabilities Administration makes determinations of individuals with mental retardation. Total payments for PASARR during fiscal year 1997, the most recent data available, were $1,006,605 for 2,409 claims.58 For further information on the State's efforts to place individuals in the least restrictive environment, see sections of this paper in Part II on the Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services Waiver for Older Adults and the Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services Waiver for Adults with Physical Disabilities. B. Board of Physician Quality Assurance and Board of Nursing  Health occupation regulatory boards associated with DHMH oversee the licensure of health professionals in Maryland. The Board of Physician Quality Assurance (""BPQA"") will accept and investigate complaints it receives regarding physicians. Additionally, the Board of Nursing oversees licensure of nurses and the certification of certified nursing assistants. 58  Maryland Medical Care Programs, The Year in Review: Fiscal Year 1997 and 1998, p. 10.  44   C.  Maryland Insurance Administration (""MIA"")  The Maryland Insurance Administration (""MIA"") provides for the licensure of insurers and agents, establishment of financial and capital standards for insurers of all types, requirements for rate making and disclosure, and for fair practices. Consumer complaints regarding coverage decisions and appeals of medical necessity decisions made by HMOs or insurers are handled through the MIA. The Administration's Division of Life and Health is responsible for regulating life, health (including long-term care), HMO, annuity, and dental plan insurance lines. In an effort to provide customer information in the area of health insurance, the Maryland Insurance Administration publishes a series of publications including, but not limited to the following: Health Insurance for Small Businesses--Rate Comparison Guide. This guide provides a comparison of premiums for the Comprehensive Standard Health Benefit Plan for all health insurance companies using a model group. Consumer's Guide to Health Insurance in Maryland This publication provides information about health care coverage, including an explanation of how health insurance works, types of health insurance available, shopping tips, options if consumers cannot afford health coverage, how to file a complaint and frequently asked questions.(To be available on-line Winter 2000) Additionally, the MIA distributes the following health insurance-related publications produced by federal agencies or the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (""NAIC""): NAIC Shoppers Guide to Long-Term Care which assists consumers in understanding long-term care and the insurance options that can help pay for long term care services. Guide to Health Insurance for People with Medicare which offers assistance in the purchase and use of Medicare supplemental or Medigap insurance. The guide also includes information on other kinds of health insurance (i.e. group insurance, retiree coverage, etc.) and long-term care insurance. This is produced annually by the U.S. Health Care Financing Administration. D. Maryland Department of Aging (""MDoA"")  In addition to its previously discussed role in the review and approval of CCRCs, the Maryland Department of Aging is responsible for taking the lead in the planning, coordination, and delivery of programs and services for older Marylanders to promote their health and well-being. These services are provided at the local level, through Maryland's nineteen Area Agencies on Aging. These Local Area Agencies either  45   provide services directly to older persons or contract with other public or private agencies to administer programs. To accomplish its mission, the Department receives state general funds and federal funds authorized through the Older Americans Act and other sources. One of the resources that the MDoA provides is Client and Advocacy Services. Among the activities this service affords to elderly persons are: Services to Frail Older Individuals, Elder Abuse Prevention, Senior Legal Assistance, Public Guardianship, Senior Health Insurance Counseling and Advocacy (Senior HICAP), Senior Care, and Long Term Care Ombudsman. Senior Care is a statewide long-term care service delivery system which coordinates community-based services to individuals 65 and older, according to their needs. In the Long Term Care Ombudsman Service, local ombudsmen receive, investigate, and seek to resolve complaints from, or on behalf of, residents of long term care facilities (nursing homes). During the course of the closure of a nursing home, the role of the local Long Term Care Ombudsman is to monitor the closure and respond to requests for assistance from nursing home residents or family members. The State Ombudsman is responsible for training local ombudsmen, providing technical assistance, and providing the overall leadership for the program. E. Office of the Attorney General of Maryland, Division of Health Education and Advocacy  This division within the Office of the Attorney General of Maryland provides a Consumer Hot Line which serves as a conduit to callers directing them to agencies within State government which could best help resolve concerns related to nursing homes, other health care billing, and provider questions. Additionally, this division may help a consumer who is involved in an appeal process related to a nursing home issue. Monitored by mediators with experience in both the insurance and provider industries, some two dozen volunteers answer consumer calls. In cooperation with the Maryland State Bar Association, the University of Maryland School of Law's Law and Health Care Program, the Maryland Department of Aging, and the Legal Aid Bureau, Inc., this part of the Consumer Protection Division of the Maryland Attorney General's Office also periodically publishes Nursing Homes: What You Need to Know. The latest revised edition was in 1998. The book is a compact compendium which presents what choices and alternatives one has when considering a nursing home, what to expect in nursing home care, consideration of planning one's finances and payment for nursing home care, as well as resources of where to get help with questions related to nursing homes. F. Maryland Health Care Commission (""MHCC"")  Through the health planning statute, the Maryland Health Care Commission (""MHCC"") is responsible for the administration of the State Health Plan, which guides decision making under the Certificate of Need program and the formulation of key health  46   care policies, and the administration of the Certificate of Need program, under which actions by certain health care facilities and services are subject to Commission review 59 Through the Certificate of Need program, the Commission regulates and approval. market entry and exit by the health care facilities and individual medical services covered by CON review requirements, as well as other actions they may propose, such as increases in bed or service capacity, capital expenditures, or expansion into new service areas. ""Certificate of Need"" as a regulatory tool has three levels, each initiated by a written notice or letter of intent to the Commission. For confirmation that a Certificate of Need is not required to establish a certain kind of health care facility or service, a person requests a ""determination of coverage"" by CON requirements. Staff and counsel analyze the proposal according to the Commission's statute and applicable regulations, and, if CON review and approval is not needed to undertake the project, the Executive Director issues a determination to that effect as the Commission's designee. Proposed new health care facilities and specified actions by existing facilities that do require CON approval come to the Commission either in response to a schedule regularly published in the Maryland Register, or, if no schedule has been published for a particular service, as an unscheduled review. Procedural rules dictate how unscheduled reviews must be administratively handled so as to permit a comparative review for the new service, if that is appropriate or practical. The CON review itself proceeds according to additional rules set forth at COMAR 10.24.01, evaluates an application against all applicable standards and need projections for the service in the State Health Plan, and applies six general review criteria related to the need for and the likely impact of the proposed project on the health care system. Statute requires that staff (or a Commissioner appointed as a reviewer in a comparative or competitive review) bring a recommendation on a proposed project to the 60 full Commission within 90 days of docketing. The first thirty days after docketing are set aside as a public comment period, in which interested members of the public, as well  The MHCC also establishes a comprehensive standard health benefit plan for small employers, and evaluates proposed mandated benefits for inclusion in the standard health benefit plan. In its annual evaluation of the small group market, the Commission considers the impact of any proposed new benefits on the mandated affordability cap of the small group market's benefit package, which is 12 percent of Maryland's average wage, and the impact of any premium increases on the small employers. With regard to nursing-home level care, Maryland's Comprehensive Standard Health Benefit Plan for Small Businesses currently includes a ""skilled nursing facility care"" benefit characterized as ""100 days as an alternative to otherwise covered care in a hospital or other related institution, i.e. nursing home,"" which carries ""a $20.00 co-payment or applicable coinsurance, whichever is greater."" 60  59  Docketing is the formal start of a CON review; the time period in which a recommendation is to come to the full Commission is 150 days, if an evidentiary hearing is held. However, 1995 legislation to streamline the CON review process mandated the adoption of regulations that restrict evidentiary hearing to those cases in which the ""magnitude of the impact"" of a potential new facility or service merit the additional time and transactional cost.  47   as ""interested parties"" in the legal sense, may comment on the proposal or, if they meet criteria in regulation, enter the review in opposition to the project. Since 1985, health planning statute has permitted the Commission to find, ""in its sole discretion,"" that certain actions by existing health care facilities -- if the facilities proposing them are merging, or have merged and are proposing to further consolidate or to reconfigure their bed capacity or services  may be exempted from the Certificate of Need requirement that would otherwise apply. This so-called ""exemption"" from the CON requirement may be granted through action by the Commission for several kinds of actions proposed ""pursuant to a consolidation or merger"" of two or more health care facilities, if the proposed action:    Is ""not inconsistent with"" the State Health Plan ; ""Will result in the delivery of more efficient and effective health care services""; and 62 Is ""in the public interest."" 61  A merged asset system seeking such a finding by the Commission must provide notice of its intent at least 45 days before it requests action on the proposal. Additional procedural regulations (at COMAR 10.24.01.04C) require the Commission to provide notice to the public, with the opportunity to comment on the proposed action. Market Entry: Certificate of Need Review of Proposed Nursing Home Projects Entry into the market for proposed new nursing homes, and for expansion of bed capacity at existing facilities, has been regulated through Certificate of Need since the creation of the former Health Resources Planning Commission in 1982, and had required CON approval under the HRPC's predecessor agency, since the inception of CON in Maryland. COMAR 10.24.08, the State Health Plan chapter governing review and approval of long term care services, permits the Commission to docket for review a CON application to establish or expand a nursing facility only if the bed need projection 63 currently in effect shows unmet need for new beds in the jurisdiction in question.  ""Or the institution-specific plan developed and adopted by the Commission,"" pursuant to its authority at Health-General Article 19-122, Annotated Code of Maryland. 62 63  61  Health-General 19-123(j)(2)(iv). COMAR 10.24.08.05C sets forth the docketing rules for nursing home CON applications. Although the Commission's need projection for the year 2000, currently being updated as part of the larger update of the entire Plan chapter, still shows bed need in both Harford County (137 beds) and on the Eastern Shore (aggregated by regulation for the region, at 139 beds), the former HRPC denied multiple applications in those two areas, in the last comparative reviews with evidentiary hearings, under the former procedural rules for CON review. Neither the Plan nor CON regulations obligate the Commission to approve previously-projected need if present occupancies or the proposed projects themselves do not warrant approval. The last new nursing facilities approved to meet projected need for 2000 were projects in Frederick County (11/95) and Carroll County (2/96). See Table XX below.  48   The analysis of applications for CON approval for new or expanded nursing homes evaluates how the proposed project meets the applicable standards, policies, and need projections in the State Health Plan, and how it addresses the six general review criteria found in the Certificate of Need procedural regulations at COMAR 64 The other element of CON review, the currently-applicable bed need 10.24.01.08G(3). projection, is derived through a set of assumptions about the State's available inventory of nursing home beds and about the use rates and origin of nursing home patients in different age groups, applied to population and demographics. A concise description of the Commission's nursing home bed need methodology is attached to this paper as Appendix E. The State Health Plan rules and standards that are applied to CON reviews of proposed new facilities or expansions (beyond the statutory ""waiver bed"" rule that permits increases of 10 beds or 10% of total beds, whichever is less, two years after the last change in licensed capacity) fall into several distinct categories. ""Program policies"" articulated in the Plan (at COMAR 10.24.08.05) establish rules governing the start and the basic categories of nursing home reviews, and also include rules that apply to other CON-related actions such as the creation and permitted use of waiver beds in nursing homes. The general categories of program policies include:    docketing standards, which determine whether applications for new facilities or expansions will be accepted and may be docketed for review; approval rules, which set baseline standards for the kinds of proposed projects that may be granted CON approval if otherwise consistent with service-specific standards and projected need; and preference standards, which give an edge in a comparative review to proposed projects that will achieve goals identified by the Plan as desirable (such as optimally-sized nursing units, increased geographic access, or conversions of former acute care hospitals.)  The Plan standards at COMAR 10.24.08.06, taken together, provide a composite description of what the Commission has established, through its staff research, deliberation, and the public adoption process that produce the goals and policies of the State Health Plan, a nursing home in Maryland should be and do for its residents. These standards require nursing homes to serve mentally-impaired residents, including those with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, to provide or support the provision of community-based services such as adult day care; and to address the needs of any nonelderly residents.  64  In brief, these criteria require an application to: (1) address the State Health Plan standards applicable to the proposed project; (2) demonstrate need for the proposed new facility or service; (3) demonstrate that the project represents the most cost-effective alternative for meeting the identified need; (4) demonstrate the viability of the project by documenting both financial and non-financial resources sufficient to initiate and sustain the service; (5) demonstrate the applicant's compliance with the terms and conditions of any previous CONs; and (6) ""provide information and analysis"" on the ""impact of the proposed project on existing health care providers in the service area.""  49   Another Plan standard applied to nursing home reviews is the requirement that every applicant ""for a new facility, or for renovation, replacement, or expansion of an existing facility"" agree to participate in the Medical Assistance program. This standard was established at a time when numerous nursing facilities did not accept residents who would be Medicaid recipients at admission or would spend down to Medicaid soon after admission. Although it was impossible to mandate these facilities to accept and admit Medicaid recipients, virtually nothing significant that a typical nursing home would seek to undertake  whether expansion, renovation, or a complete replacement facility  could be accomplished without CON approval, which would not happen absent a commitment to admit Medicaid-funded residents. The Plan requires that, as a condition of CON approval for any of the above actions by an existing facility as well as to construct a new facility, each applicant ""agree in writing to serve a proportion of Medicaid patients that is at least equal to the proportion of Medicaid patients in all other nursing home beds in the 65 jurisdiction or the health service area, whichever is lower . . . ."" This commitment is documented by the submission of a Memorandum of Understanding, executed between the applicant and the Medical Assistance program, which must be provided to the Commission before pre-licensure review. The Plan standard permits a new facility three years to achieve its agreed-upon Medicaid proportion, but requires a showing of ""good faith effort"" toward that goal during the first two years of operation. Additional review standards in this section of the State Health Plan require new facilities to be served by a public water system; prohibit a new facility from locating next to an existing facility; present architectural features designed for any ""special care needs"" among its intended residents; demonstrate ""ongoing compliance"" with all federal, State, and local safety regulations; and document ""awareness of and the ability to meet"" all of the ""facility and program requirements"" found in State licensure regulations. Prospective new nursing homes must also document transfer agreements with other health care facilities to provide any services required by residents that the facility itself cannot provide. Other standards delineate a baseline ""appropriate living environment,"" and require each applicant to agree to organize a ""formal grievance procedure, Resident and Family Council, or both"" to bring any resident issues to the facility. In addition to the Certificate of Need review for new or expanded nursing home capacity, owners of existing facilities, or persons who may have purchased the right to operate some number of nursing home beds from an existing or closed must, in most 66 circumstances , obtain CON approval to redevelop the existing beds at another site. (Because need for nursing home beds is calculated and projected on the county level, the 65 66  COMAR 10.24.08.06A(4). HB 994 (Ch. 678, Acts 1999) permits a merged asset system to relocate a health care facility (including a nursing home) within that facility's primary service area, as defined in the State Health Plan, through a notice letter to the Commission; the facility may be relocated within the larger primary service area of the entire system, through an exemption finding by the Commission. The capital expenditure necessary to construct the replacement facility would still require CON approval, pursuant to 19-123(k). One provision of HB 994 related to increases or decreases in bed capacity between member hospitals of a merged asset system, also by written notice, expressly excludes nursing home beds from that action. However, merged systems with two or more nursing facilities may reconfigure beds between facilities within the same jurisdiction, with an exemption finding by the Commission.  50   proposed relocation must be to another site in the same jurisdiction.) An examination of the Commission's Certificate of Need actions over the past three fiscal years shows that relocation of nursing home capacity has become a major activity of the CON program, as it relates to the nursing home industry. As shown in Table 5 below, the Commission has considered markedly different kinds of CON projects during the last three fiscal years than it typically received and reviewed through the mid-1990s. The Commission's review docket and its monthly report of CON actions (including responses to requests to temporarily delicense nursing home beds, acknowledgements of acquisitions of closed or bankrupt facilities, and of corporate restructuring among nursing home chains) clearly reflect the changed environment and the challenges that confront the nursing home industry, in Maryland as well as across the country. Table 5 lists all of the CON actions taken by the former HRPC and the Maryland Health Care Commission between July 1, 1997 and June 30, 2000. Five years have passed since the Commission received an application to construct a new facility, implementing new bed need projected by the State Health Plan. The last ""new-bed"" new facilities approved, as the note to the table indicates, were approved in late 1995 and early 1996, and the 17 beds awarded to Harford Memorial Hospital for its subacute care 67 unit in February 1997 were the last new nursing home beds to come into the system through CON approval. What has succeeded the traditional new-facility, new-beds CON application are CONs for capital expenditures to replace or renovate existing facilities; applications to relocate existing beds between existing facilities, or from an existing nursing home (or, more commonly, from a facility closed by bankruptcy proceeding) to a new site within the county; and, far more frequently, denials of new CONs and withdrawals of CONs from failed projects. Over the last three fiscal years, actions taken by the Commission include:    four replacement facilities and major renovation projects; a total of eight CON denials, in large comparative reviews in Harford County and on the eastern Shore; four extensions of performance requirements for CON projects under development, three of which were eventually relinquished, although the fourth, for an Anne Arundel facility, was built and opened during 1999; and one Commission action withdrawing a CON.    67  As indicated above, beds designated by hospitals or nursing homes as ""subacute"" are actually licensed by the Department as ""special"" comprehensive care facility beds.  51   Table 5 MHRPC/MHCC CON ACTIONS RELATED TO NURSING HOMES, FY 1998-FY 2000 Fiscal Year/Date FY 1998 July 1997  Action by Commission Modification approved to CON under development as Lorien-Taneytown, permitting 62 beds to be relocated and developed as Lorien LifeCenter-Mt.

Airy in southern Carroll County), and Carroll County General Hospital (15-bed subacute care unit-- later relinquished); November 1995: Glade Valley Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, Frederick County (124 beds)  52   Hospital subacute units, approved between 1995 and 199768, were hard-hit by HCFA's 1998 imposition of a prospective payment system for this Medicare benefit, since it assigned the lowest rates to units not licensed before October 1995. During the last two years, four CONs for hospital-based subacute units have been relinquished (Carroll County General Hospital, Howard County General Hospital, Dorchester General Hospital, and Memorial Hospital of Cumberland) and two that had begun operation were 69 closed by CON exemption (at University of Maryland and Bon Secours Hospitals.) Four approvals by the Commission  one a modification to an existing CON for 125 new nursing home beds in Carroll County, and three subsequent relocation CONs  signaled a willingness on the part of one nursing home corporation to reshape the traditional facility. Although the approval by the former HRPC of a proposal to split the 125 beds approved for the Lorien-Taneytown facility between the original and a second site in southern Carroll County was contested by an existing facility near the new Mt. Airy site, the HRPC's decision was eventually upheld in the Court of Appeals. In the meantime, the same parent company had brought three additional proposals to the Commission and obtained its approval for a new model of long term facility, with a smaller core of comprehensive care beds (and a still-smaller skilled or subacute-level unit), surrounded by a larger complement of assisted living beds, which are not regulated by CON. Market Exit: Closures Voluntary and Involuntary Statute requires that the Commission approve a ""change in type or scope"" of a health care service provided by a regulated health care facility; although expressed as a double negative, the law requires that before ""the elimination of an existing medical service"" (which includes ""comprehensive [nursing home] care"") a health care facility must obtain a Certificate of Need. This may seem counter-intuitive semantically, but what its law requires is that the Commission review the proposed closure of a nursing home. The purpose of this CON review is not to deny permission to close a nursing facility, but to pursue the Commission's ""due diligence"" in determining the impact on access to these services by the people that depended on the facility, as well as the impact on the remaining facilities in the affected area. In its essence, the review of a CON application to close a facility reverses the process and the questions that shape CON review for new capacity. The only instance to date of CON review in the voluntary closure of a nursing home is the closure by the MedStar system of the 121-bed Church Nursing Center in Baltimore City, which was located physically within Church Hospital, closed by MedStar  68  Included in the subacute beds approved during 1995 was a pool of 175 beds established by the former HRPC during deliberations on the Health Care Reform Act of 1995 (Ch. 499, Acts 1995) to respond to the hospital industry's perceived need to establish 69 The subacute unit at Doctors Community Hospital was temporarily closed for over a year, and Maryland General Hospital's unit remains closed until a decision is reached about its future.  53   between October and November of 1999. Commission staff focused its review of MedStar's application to close Church Nursing Center on an examination of where and how the patients in the facility were relocated; most were helped by the nursing home staff to find other nearby nursing homes, which increased their occupancies. Staff also examined the origin of Church's patients by zip code, to demonstrate that the facility's service area was well-served by existing, geographically accessible nursing homes. MedStar's analysis of the exigencies of attempting to keep open and operating two floors of a much larger, largely unoccupied building was another factor in the expedited review. Staff issued its report approximately thirty days after the end of the public comment period, and the Commission adopted staff's recommendation on April 20, 2000. The other closures of nursing homes in Maryland, over the industry's history in the state, have been involuntary: periodic events resulting from bankruptcy proceedings, decertification from Medicaid or Medicare and subsequent closure by the Department for poor quality care, or the occasional instance of an operator's conviction of Medicaid fraud. These closures are generally considered temporary, pending the acquisition of the facility (which requires only a written notice 30 days before completion of the sale, with disclosure of information listed in regulation) and a subsequent proposal for the redevelopment of the beds. In the early- to mid-90s era of high occupancy and a tight market for existing beds, the acquisition of these involuntarily closed facilities and their beds was a foregone conclusion. Five years later, regulations require that beds from CONs withdrawn by the Commission be removed from the inventory.  70  70  Church Hospital was the first facility to close under the provisions of 1999's HB 994, which permits hospitals in jurisdictions with three or more hospitals to close after a 45-day written notice to the Commission, if the hospital, in consultation with the Commission, holds a public informational hearing in the affected area.  54   IV.  MARYLAND CERTIFICATE OF NEED REGULATION COMPARED TO OTHER STATES  As it did with home health agency and hospice services, the MHCC commissioned a survey of all fifty states and the District of Columbia, to ascertain the status of Certificate of Need regulation of nursing home beds and facilities across the country, and, if possible, to determine the ""principal effects . . . of differing regulatory policies among the states."" The complete report based upon this survey by the Commission's contractor, the American health Planning Association, is available as a separate document to accompany this working paper.71 A central finding of the study, with regard to the regulation of nursing home beds and facilities by Certificate of Need, is a remarkable degree of consensus  even among states that ended their CON programs over a decade ago  that the supply of nursing home beds needs to be controlled. The mechanisms for limiting growth in capacity vary, but a concern for the impact on each state's Medicaid budget is virtually always the reason, since state Medicaid programs are the primary source of payment for long term nursing care. Figures cited in the AHPA study report for the national expenditures for nursing home care in 1998 show that, of a total outlay of $100 billion, 43% was paid by Medicaid. The next highest payer percentage was private pay, at 31%, followed at a distance by Medicare payments, at 14%, private insurance at 7%, with 5% of the expenditures from other sources.72 The AHPA report found the patterns of CON regulation of nursing homes across the states ""distinctive,"" because:     Fewer states have eliminated or reduced CON regulation of nursing home services than have eliminated or reduced CON regulation of any other service; The duration of CON regulation of these services is comparatively long, with many states beginning regulation of this service earlier and retaining it longer than for many other services; A surprisingly large number of states have augmented CON regulation of nursing home services with other forms of market entry or capacity management such as moratoria on development; and A majority of states that have formally dropped CON regulation have replaced it, at least temporarily, with equally or more stringent market entry and capacity management controls such as development moratoria and reimbursement limits.73  The report notes that, with the exception of three western states (Idaho, New Mexico, and Utah), all of the states regulated the development of nursing home beds and 71  Maryland Health Care Commission, Certificate of Need Regulation of Nursing Home Services in the United States, October 25, 2000. 72 Id., citing Feder, J., et.al., ""Long Term Care in the United States: An Overview,"" Health Affairs (May/June 2000), p. 43. 73 Id., p. 10.  55   facilities for a least a decade over the past 25 years. Initially, the federal health planning requirements mandated CON coverage for nursing home services, but some states had begun ending or at least cutting back their CON programs beginning in the early 1980s. A total of fourteen states have discontinued CON for nursing home services; of these, ten ended their programs between 1983and 1987, when the federal requirement  and funding -- for health planning and CON ended. Of the fourteen states without CON review of nursing homes, six currently have a moratorium in place, and several of the eight currently without a cap on beds or facilities have imposed a moratorium for some period of time in the past. Even though these states ended the limitation on capacity and bar to market entry enforced by the CON requirement, several ""effectively replaced [CON] regulation with other market barriers, including moratoria.74 Table 7 CON Regulatory Status By State, Nursing Home Services CON Status Number of States Number without Moratorium 21 8 29 Number with Moratorium 16 6 22  CON 37 No CON 14 Total* 51 *Including the District of Columbia  Consequently, while the trend  with regard to CON and most other regulatory tools  has been toward less regulation, and while many of the thirty-seven CON states have removed the CON requirement from some services, the AHPA report shows that ""there has been remarkably little actual deregulation of nursing home development."" Since, two-thirds of these services are reimbursed by public payers, the concern about the effect of excess capacity on utilization and hence on public program budgets has prompted even CON-free states (primarily in the west and Midwest) to retain some level of capacity control. With regard to the question of how the CON requirement has restricted the supply of nursing home beds, research from the early 1990s cited in the AHPA report found that ""the number of years a state had a CON program and imposed a moratorium on nursing home beds to be negatively correlated"" with both the percentage growth in nursing home beds, and a correspondingly positive correlation between average occupancy and the number of years under a CON requirement and moratorium. Other studies from about the same time found that low Medicaid reimbursement rates effectively controlled the supply of nursing home beds. The consensus of the research from that period concluded  74  Some Western states, such as Arizona, restrict the development of new facilities or capacity seeking reimbursement by the Medicaid program by requiring prior approval by the region's Medicaid managed care organization.  56   that these two mechanisms  CON and moratoria, and a state's Medicaid payment policies  had the most impact on the supply of nursing home beds.75 For more recent years, as occupancies have dropped, the relationships between CON (with or without a moratorium) and nursing home use and occupancy become less clear cut. This is partly because of factors by now familiar: the further development of home care and assisted living alternatives to nursing home placement, the spread of Medicaid waivers for long term care in the community, Medicaid policies that tighten eligibility and limit payment. One trend that does emerge clearly from the data presented in AHPA's report is that ""the rate of increase in Medicare- and Medicaid-certified facilities in states that eliminated CON regulation was several times [the rate in] those states that continued CON regulation."" 76 Hence, the application of CON and moratoria seems to limit supply of those beds whose creation and use has the greatest impact on public funds. Another interesting set of comparisons made possible by the data collected in AHPA's survey illustrates that, although quality of care issues have produced legislative remedies now being implemented in Maryland, the State's nursing facilities compare favorably to their counterparts in other states and as a national average. Using data reported by state licensure agencies and on the HCFA website, which compare the average performance on quality surveys by Maryland facilities to that of other CON states, to non-CON states with and without moratoria, and to a national average, Maryland has a much higher percentage of deficiency-free facilities (32%, against 16.3% nationally) and a lower average number of deficiencies (3.1 as compared to 5.4 deficiencies per facility, nationally.)77 The report concludes that, despite the elimination of Certificate of Need review in fourteen states, nursing homes remain the health service ""most frequently regulated"" by CON. From its intensive collection, review, and analysis of data provided by every state on its regulation of nursing home beds and facilities, the AHPA report concludes that ""CON regulation of nursing home development . . . appears to be associated with slower capacity growth, higher average occupancy levels, large [and therefore more efficientlyoperated] average facility size, lower nursing-home-to-[elderly at-risk]-population bed ratios, and lower age-specific nursing home use rates.""78  75  The studies cited include Harrington, Curtis, and DuNah's ""Trends in State Regulation of the Supply of Long Term Care Services"" (HCFA: San Francisco, 1994); Swan, Dewit, et.al.

The options discussed in this section represent potential alternative regulatory strategies to achieve the policies, goals, and objectives embodied in Maryland's Certificate of Need program, with regard to oversight of nursing homes. The role of government in these options describes a continuum varying from the current role (Option 1), to a more expanded role on one end of the continuum (Option 2), to an extremely limited role at the other end of the continuum (Option 6). The options discussed below, singly or in combination, suggest potential alternative strategies that could be considered in the context of the larger issue of the regulation of health care services in Maryland. This list of options is by no means an exhaustive one. It is through the public comment process that the Commission expects and encourages other options and ideas to be generated. Another ""option"" might apply to any of the alternatives for changing the government oversight of nursing homes in Maryland: a change could be phased-in, or approved with a delayed effect to allow for a period of transition. The questions suggested in the guiding principles in the Commission's An Analysis and Evaluation of Certificate of Need Regulation in Maryland: Study Overview provide a framework for the evaluation of these options. A. Option 1  Maintain Existing Certificate of Need Program Regulation  This option maintains the Certificate of Need program as currently designed, with the existing coverage and procedural rules. Under current law, as previously described, establishing a new nursing home service requires a Certificate of Need, based on the Commission's review of an applicant's consistency with the State Health Plan policies, standards, need projections, and other CON review criteria. Certain other actions also require CON review and approval, most notably the relocation of existing nursing homes or bed capacity within their jurisdiction, and the capital expenditure (in excess of the current $1.45 million review threshold) needed to replace or do major renovation of an existing nursing home. Voluntarily closing a nursing home also requires Certificate of Need review, which focuses on the impact on patient access and on other facilities in the same area as the facility to be closed. B. Option 2  Expanded Certificate of Need Program Regulation: Include Level 3 and 3+ Assisted Living Facilities  The question of procedural equity in Maryland between nursing homes and assisted living facilities was raised during the development of regulations governing the establishment and operation of assisted living facilities, in response to 1996 legislation intended to rationalize the patchwork regulation of assisted living programs by several  58   State agencies. The overall State policy goal of SB 545 was to promote the creation of a more residential, less medical model of long term care, that let individuals ""age in place"" and receive progressively more complex care as they became medically more fragile, and to reserve more expensive nursing home care (particularly when Medicaid would be the payer) for those needing skilled nursing care. SB 545 was crafted with a delayed effective date, to give time for the complex process of developing regulations, under the new authority given to the Office of Health Care Quality (then the Licensing and Certification Administration) to license and oversee assisted living facilities. The problem with the ""aging in place"" model, from the viewpoint of the nursing home industry, was that when assisted living residents eventually needed nursing-home level care, it would be delivered in a bed, and in a facility, not required to undergo CON review and obtain Commission approval, and also not subject to other kinds of regulatory oversight. The prospect of assisted living facilities admitting patients with skilled nursing needs without being subject to a bed need forecast or to CON review was a concern to the nursing home industry. Nursing home representatives argued for the inclusion of provisions that limit the number of skilled-nursing level residents a facility may house at a given time, that require the Office of Health Care Quality to issue a waiver each time a resident must progress to a more complex level of care, and that prohibit assisted living facilities from accepting any 80 person who qualifies for nursing-home level care at the time admission. The growth and the use by eligible seniors of assisted living facilities has a clear and direct impact on the use of nursing home beds -- in much the same way as the use of adult medical day care, which delays a person's entry into a nursing home, and is factored into the Commission's current bed need methodology. The development of Medicaid waivers to cover assisted living services could broaden this impact on nursing home occupancies across the State. Any factor that further compromises the level of utilization of nursing home beds and facilities intensifies the pressures already besetting this industry. In response to nursing homes, nine o CON approval for new to obtain Certificate of capacity dedicated to regulations. the effect assisted living has and will to continue to have on f the 37 states (including the District of Columbia) that require or expanded nursing facilities also require assisted living facilities Need approval. This option would extend CON review to the bed the highest levels of care permitted under assisted living  79  79 80  Ch. 147, Acts 1996. In practice, since the January 1, 1999 effective date of the Department's assisted living regulations, OHCQ had received fewer than ten requests for waivers to enable facilities to keep and care for patients who had progressed to Level 3+ or nursing-home level care. Only two had been granted, statewide, by mid-2000.  59   C.  Option 3  Impose Moratorium on New Nursing Home Beds  A significant number of states  among those that continue to require CON approval for nursing homes, as well as those that have ended their CON programs  have imposed a moratorium on new nursing homes and new beds, even on replacement projects, as a way of limiting the impact on their Medical Assistance budgets of nursing home reimbursements. As shown in the American Health Planning Association's study and survey of how state governments throughout the nation oversee and regulate nursing home capacity and construction, a total of nearly half of the states -- 22 in all -- have imposed a 81 moratorium on new nursing home capacity and projects. Sixteen states that continue to regulate nursing homes through CON have taken this action; six states that have repealed their programs have simultaneously imposed a moratorium on new capacity. The degree of consensus on this one issue is noteworthy: only eight of 50 states (and the District of Columbia) have no barrier to new nursing home capacity through CON or moratorium or both. The fact that state Medicaid reimbursement rates include allowances for capital and operating costs, a lingering concern that a new bed will generate its own demand, and the steady two-thirds of the patient population that spend down to Medicaid within a year of admission  all of these factors continue to provide compelling arguments to the states for controlling nursing home capacity and construction. The experience of the states that have imposed a moratorium may be instructive, and has been the subject of recent communications between states that retain their CON requirement along with the freeze on capacity, and still require CON review and approval for proposed replacement facilities and major capital renovations by existing facilities. Ohio has had a moratorium on nursing home beds since 1993, and since that year has 82 been ""prohibited from calculating a bed need."" Although Ohio's average occupancy is ""in the 80% range,"" some ""areas and providers with high occupancy could use additional 81  Once during the history of the former HRPC, the General Assembly imposed a one-year moratorium on that body's action on any proposal related to nursing home beds or facilities. This hiatus in an otherwise vigorous activity was mandated by Ch. 614, Acts 1989, in response to a December 1988 report by a special joint legislative oversight committee, which expressed great concern over the rapidly growing amount of the Medicaid budget dedicated to the ""costs and services supported by the program for long term care,"" and particularly over what was seen as a disproportionate share of those funds devoted to institutional, as opposed to community-based care. The purpose of the moratorium, which extended from June 1, 1989 to June 1, 1990, was to evaluate the effectiveness of the measures by which the HRPC exacted commitments from competing nursing home applicants to also provide community-based services, whether the HRPC's authority to require and enforce these commitments was sufficient, and whether the promised services ever materialized. The report issued after the one-year moratorium recommended ways in which the HRPC could better target and enforce its existing regulatory authority in this regard. It should be observed that much of the ""disproportionate"" allocation of Medicaid payment between facilities and community-based care was the result of federal-level law and policy; the State's eventual success in obtaining the home- and community-based waiver was a necessary step in seeking to change that balance. 82 Electronic mail communications from Christine Kenney of Ohio and Thomas Piper of Missouri, through an internet forum established by Piper with the encouragement and support of the American Health Planning Association.  60   beds."" The only source of these beds is the purchase of operating rights to existing beds from existing providers: but the absolute restriction on supply has inflated the purchase price of such beds, and these costs have been passed through to both Medicaid and Medicare. Missouri continues a strict moratorium, but has established a system in which facilities with high occupancy and no deficiencies for 18 consecutive months may seek CON approval to purchase and move beds from anywhere in the state. Many states are re-evaluating their moratorium measures, and the effect that a cap on supply has had on their industries. One problem with any form of limitation on supply and the potential for ""excess demand""  a situation that arguably existed in Maryland through the early and mid-1990s but no longer exists, with occupancy statewide in the 88% range  is that, historically, residents on Medical Assistance or soon to be Medicaid-eligible had the most difficulty in locating a bed. The Commission's requirement that a new, renovating, or expanding facility had to accept Medicaid recipients equal to the jurisdiction's average Medicaid occupancy as a condition for CON approval helped to prevent that circumstance. Concerns for access to nursing home care persist, however, leading 29 states (and the District) to choose against the use of a moratorium to control nursing home bed capacity. This option does not contemplate a moratorium without a regular, periodic calculation of bed need, in part because of the phenomenon experienced by Ohio, where certain areas and facilities continue to experience high occupancy despite the general downward trend. In addition, though the ""baby boom"" generation will not use nursing home care in sufficient numbers to ameliorate current low occupancies for some time to come, health care is such a dynamic environment that simple prudence would support continuing to monitor and interpret its changes. D. Option 4  Deregulation of Nursing Homes from Certificate of Need Review, With Creation of a Data Collection and Reporting Model to Encourage Quality of Care  Another option for nursing home regulation involves replacing the CON program's requirements governing market entry and exit with a program of mandatory data collection and reporting. Some of the same effects that could reasonably be anticipated under deregulation from CON with no alternative, additional means of oversight could also be expected to apply under this option: new supply could enter this already-stressed market with relative ease and rapidity, and further press existing providers. As discussed in Part II, the same 1999 legislation that created a Task Force on Quality of Care in Nursing Facilities in response to concerns about the State's role in monitoring nursing home care also required the Commission to develop a Nursing Home Report Card, in consultation with the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and the Maryland Department of Aging. As noted in the earlier discussion, the steering committee formed to guide its development has chosen a consulting firm to design a conceptual model of a nursing home report card, and this work continues; 1999's SB 740 requires the Commission to present a preliminary report to the General Assembly on the  61   development of the nursing home evaluation system by January 1, 2001, with final implementation no later than July 1, 2001. The ""report card"" model of performance report is intended to collect and interpret information on how providers rate in those measures of ""best practices"" chosen as markers of quality, to help guide the decision facing individuals who may require nursing home admission, and their families. Performance reports also provide benchmarks against which providers can measure themselves, and seek to improve quality in any areas found deficient. Consequently, report cards may both inform consumer choice, and also encourage improvement in the performance of nursing home providers. Once the report card is in place, nursing homes might eventually publicize good performance records identified in these regular evaluations, as one HMO has recently begun to do with the release of the Commission's latest HMO Report Card. Another form that a data reporting and dissemination model of government oversight can take is a ""provider feedback"" mechanism, targeted more explicitly to informing the providers of care of the areas in which they may be below certain agreedupon standards of care and efficient operation. It is arguable that such a mechanism already exists for nursing homes, and has far more force than would a gentle suggestion or good example: the Office of Health Care Quality's surveys of nursing homes, whether routine or in response to complaints, result in deficiency findings that operators must address. Failure to respond immediately to identified deficiencies, or to a finding that the extent of a facility's deficiencies has created a situation dangerous to its residents, results in a range of sanctions requiring an immediate plan of correction, and presents the possibility of decertification from Medicaid and Medicare and the end of those payments, and the forced closure of a facility. E. Option 5  Deregulation from Certificate of Need Review, with Approval by Medicaid Program of Any New Nursing Home Beds and Facilities Seeking Medicaid Reimbursement  Some states that discontinued their Certificate of Need programs in the early 1980s have, in effect, substituted a barrier to market entry for some kinds of nursing facilities  specifically, for any proposed new facility or proposed expansion in bed capacity at an existing facility, where the facility will seek (or already receives) reimbursement from the Medical Assistance program. Since the cost of nursing home capital construction as well as operating costs are factored in to the rates Medical Assistance pays nursing homes to care for its enrollees, the prospective impact on a state's Medicaid budget of new facilities or beds has created wide consensus, in CON and non-CON states, that controlling nursing home capacity is necessary and important. In Arizona, for example, health services for all Medicaid recipients are managed care, controlled by HMOs. A regional HMO has the authority to reject applications by proposed new facilities, whether hospitals or nursing homes, to become new Medicaid  62   providers. To the extent that a proposed new nursing home would depend on payments by Medical Assistance to support its patient base, its operations, and its initial construction, this mechanism could present a considerable barrier to entry into what is an already challenged market. Under this option, while the Medical Assistance program could assume the responsibility for conducting reviews for proposed new Medicaid providers, the need for objective standards by which to conduct such reviews  and the expertise in conducting quantitative analysis of the need for a new facility or bed capacity  would suggest that the Commission would continue as the reviewing authority, at least initially. F. Option 6  Deregulation of Nursing Homes From Certificate of Need  83  This option would remove Certificate of Need review and approval, and the barrier to market entry or exit. It would defer to the authority and rules of the State health department and its licensing agency, and particularly to those rules and conditions of participation in both Medicare and Medicaid that OHCQ administers on behalf of the federal government. Capacity of beds and facilities would not be limited by the demographically-and geographically-based formula of the Commission's bed need projections, nor subjected to the initial review of program, staffing levels, and reasonableness of construction costs that comprises much of the focus of CON review. The array of environmental factors that present challenges to the nursing home industry  the growth of assisted living and other alternative sites, the clinical and technological advances in home care capabilities, changes in Medicare reimbursement, the improved health status of older Americans  have reduced the incentive to build new nursing homes. Neither private lenders nor the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development are currently lending money or arranging mortgage loans for long term care projects. The bankruptcies and reorganizations previously described further document these difficulties. This fact, with the other problems facing nursing homes  including the general, serious shortages of nurses and other health care professionals at a time when quality legislation mandates higher staffing ratios and nursing hours -- might argue that no untoward impact will result if nursing homes are relieved of the statute's CON requirement. This view would cite the immense challenges facing the present providers as sufficient to discourage new providers, or those from out of state. An alternative view would suggest that when the volatile health care environment changes, there could be a push for overbuilding in the absence of CON, when market forces change. The Commission can decide to periodically re-evaluate any or all of its various roles in the regulatory oversight of nursing homes in Maryland  in limiting new capacity through CON review, in planning, in projecting future need, in collecting data and issuing report  83  Conversations with Paul Schafer of the Arizona office of Health Cost Control, mid-October 2000. Mr. Schafer noted that Medicaid HMOs in both the Tucson and the Phoenix area had recently denied newprovider requests by nursing homes.  63   cards  or it can decide to recommend that the General Assembly consider one of these alternative options (or a hybrid of these or additional options) for future implementation.  64   V.  SUMMARY  This report examines a range of current policy and regulatory issues affecting nursing homes, and outlines several alternative policy options for changes to the role of Certificate of Need in the regulation of nursing homes in Maryland, and some potential implications of those changes. Table 7 below summarizes the policy options discussed in this paper. The Commission expects that the public comment received on this options paper will identify additional policy options and approaches that also merit consideration, and is particularly interested in receiving comments on the financial impact that would result from changes to CON regulation of this service.

The funding increase is to enable nursing homes to :  Increase the hours of direct care to residents; Increase their nursing staff; and Increase wages, fringe benefits, and other forms of compensation to direct care personnel. Funds will be provided through increased payments in the Nursing Service Cost Center of the Medicaid reimbursement formula. The additional funds may not be used to provide an increase in the profit allowed in the Nursing Service Cost Center. This measure requires the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to reconvene the Medicaid Nursing Home Reimbursement Study Group to review the existing reimbursement formula and the proposed funding appropriation for FY02 and FY03 and report its findings to the Senate Finance and House Environmental Matters Committees on or before December 1, 2000. A provision increasing staffing requirements to 4.0 nursing hours per day was defeated.  HB 747/SB690 The Maryland Nursing Home Quality Assurance Act: measure requires nursing homes to do the following: This  Designate by September 1, 2000 a qualified individual to coordinate and manage the nursing home's quality assurance program; Establish a Quality Assurance Committee; Establish a written quality assurance plan; Employ a medical director responsible for monitoring physician services who shall report monthly to the quality assurance committee on the quality of the medical care at the nursing home; Establish a procedure to provide for the transfer of patients in the event of closure; Provide notice to residents and their families or guardians when the nursing home learns of probable closure or loss of public funding; Notify the resident's representative or guardian of any injury; and  71   Post their staffing ratios (licensed staff to residents and unlicensed staff to residents) in a visible location on each floor. Each quality assurance plan must include procedures for concurrent review for all residents, criteria for review of certain categories of care and specific incident reports, and methods to identify and correct problems. This plan must be available to residents and be submitted to DHMH by January 1, 2001. Additionally, each nursing home's quality assurance committee must be comprised of certain members, meet monthly, maintain records of all quality assurance activities, keep records of committee meetings that must be available to DHMH during any on-site visit; and review and approve the home's annual quality assurance plan. Moreover, the nursing home administrator must take appropriate remedial actions based on the recommendations of the committee.  HB 634/SB689 Sanctions and Penalties: Provides the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH) with the authority to impose sanctions and penalties instead of federal sanctions and penalties including civil money penalties against nursing homes when a deficiency or an ongoing pattern of deficiencies exists.  This measure specifies that penalties for potential harm deficiencies may not exceed $10,000 per instance or $1,000 per day until the nursing home is in compliance. Penalties for actual harm deficiencies may not exceed $10,000 per instance or $10,000 per day until the nursing home is in compliance. Calculation of the amount of the civil penalty will stop when DHMH verifies corrective action and sustained compliance on the part of the nursing home. If the nursing home appeals a civil money penalty, the funds are to be deposited in an interest bearing escrow account at the nursing home's expense. If the penalty is upheld, the monies must be released to DHMH within 15 days from the date of the decision. If the penalty is reversed, the funds held in escrow will be released to the nursing home within 15 days from the date of the decision. Funds retained by DHMH must be sued for training, grant awards, demonstration projects, or programs designed to improve quality of care. This was emergency legislation and took effect from the date it was enacted during the 2000 legislative session.  HB 748/SB 688: Requires DHMH to conduct an unannounced site visit and a full survey of each licensed nursing home twice each calendar year. If, in the two most recent surveys of the nursing home conducted after October 1, 2000, the nursing home has had no deficiencies that have the potential for minimum harm or greater, DHMH may waive the second annual survey.  72     HB 748/ SB 698 Quality of Care Oversight: Continues the Nursing Home Task Force as an oversight body. This measure Homes to monitor Force on Quality improving nursing creates an Oversight Committee on Quality of Care in Nursing and evaluate implementation of the recommendations of the Task of Care in Nursing Facilities and to evaluate the progress in home care quality, including:  quality of care standards for nursing homes; staffing patterns and staffing standards; policies for inspecting nursing homes and responding to complaints; a comparison of Maryland policies to those in other states; a labor pool available to fill nursing and nursing aide jobs; State funding mechanisms; and the regulation of nursing homes.  This legislation requires the Office of Health Care Quality (""OHCQ"") to submit a report to the Oversight Committee on March 1 and September 1 of each year on the implementation of the Task Force on Quality of Care in Nursing Facilities's recommendations and the status of quality of care in nursing homes. The Oversight Committee is to review these reports, develop recommendations to continue improvement in nursing home care, and report its recommendations to the Governor and the General Assembly on or before December 1 of each year. The bills sunset on December 31, 2005.  HB 865 Ombudsman Program: Required the Secretary of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to establish and submit a budget for minimum staffing ratios for the Ombudsman Program at the higher of one full-time ombudsman per 1,000 long term care beds, 20 hours of ombudsman time per week per Area Agency on Aging, or 10 hours of ombudsman time per week per nursing home. To fund this measure expanding the Ombudsman Program, the legislature approved a budget increase of an additional $1.9 million over the next three years.  In addition, SB 435, which would have created an awards program for nursing assistants financed by charging $750 for follow-up inspection visits, was defeated.  73   Appendix C MHCC Inventory of Comprehensive Care Beds  October 2000  74   MHCC INVENTORY of COMPREHENSIVE CARE BEDS - October 17, 2000 Maryland State Summary LHPA County Facility name Western Maryland Allegan y County Carroll County Frederick County Garrett County Washington County Western Maryland Montgomery County Montgomery County Montgomery County Southern Maryland Calvert County Charles County Prince George's County St. Mary's County Southern Maryland Central Maryland Anne Arundel County Baltimore County Harford County Howard County Baltimore City Central Maryland Eastern Shore Caroline County Cecil County Dorchester County Kent County Queen Anne's County Somerset County Talbot County Maryland State Summary LHPA County Facility name Wicomico County Worcester County Eastern Shore M ARYL AND STATE TOTAL 237 446 313 206 180 210 358 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 10 0 0 0 3 0 5 0 4 0 18 0 8 237 465 313 206 180 213 358 1837 5996 657 537 5552 14579 0 94 40 50 191 375 60 162 14 10 87 333 114 322 16 0 870 1322 1897 6377 711 597 6389 15971 294 377 2969 337 3977 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 21 0 23 0 0 63 20 83 296 377 2990 337 4000 4826 4826 8 8 90 90 76 76 4916 4916 931 822 1140 344 1293 4530 0 123 1 0 0 124 19 10 0 0 6 35 0 10 23 21 70 124 950 955 1141 344 1299 4689 Licensed Beds Certified Beds Waiver Beds Temp Delic Beds Total Beds  Licensed Beds 742 400 3092 31004  Certified Beds 0 2 11 518  Waiver Beds 0 0 13 494  Temp Delic Beds 40 12 87 1692  Total Beds 742 402 3116 32692  75   Appendix D Licensed Assisted Living Facilities by Jurisdiction: Maryland  76   Table D-1 Licensed Assisted Living Facilities by Jurisdiction: Maryland, 2000 County Allegany Anne Arundel Baltimore City Baltimore County Calvert County Caroline County Carroll County Cecil County Charles County Dorchester County Frederick County Garrett County Harford County Howard County Kent County Montgomery County Prince George's County Queen Anne's County St. Mary's County Somerset County Talbot County Washington County Wicomico County Worcester County Total All Jurisdictions84 Number of Licensed Facilities 12 103 563 247 12 17 42 26 26 21 17 9 50 93 14 139 199 14 5 1 5 27 13 7 1,662 Number of Beds 195 1,297 2,654 2,951 126 103 653 218 223 71 520 53 528 1,370 71 2,868 1,466 78 237 5 92 769 317 47 16,912  84  Source: Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, Office of Health Care Quality, Count of Assisted Living Beds by County, October 11, 2000.  77   Appendix E State Health Plan Nursing Home Bed Need Methodology  78   Nursing Home Bed Need Methodology The current nursing home bed need nursing home beds. It uses past patterns forward, with adjustments for migration, The current methodology can be described methodology is used to project future need for of age-adjusted utilization and projects them and utilization of community-based services. by the following steps:  1. Calculate the base year (1997) patient days, by age group (<65, 65-74, 75-84, 85+), area of origin, and jurisdiction of care. 2. Calculate the average use rate for each Maryland jurisdiction for each age group. 3. Calculate the target year (2004) patient days for each age group for each Maryland jurisdiction of residence by multiplying the average use rate for a given age group in the jurisdiction of residence by the target year projected population for the same age group in the jurisdiction, and dividing the result by 1000. 4. Calculate the target year patient days for each group for each jurisdiction of care, according to the following assumptions:   The need projection for nursing home beds reduces net out-migration from each area of origin by half and allocates the reduction back to the area of origin. Migration into Maryland from the adjacent sates of Delaware, the District of Columbia, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia is taken into account in estimating bed need, by assuming that the current pattern of migration from these adjacent states into Maryland will increase in the future at their projected rate of population growth. Migration into Maryland from other than adjacent states is not taken into account in estimating need. Out-migration from Maryland to adjacent and other states is assumed to remain constant.     5. Calculate the target year patient days for each jurisdiction of care by summing the target year patient days for each age group in the jurisdiction of care over all age groups. 6. Calculate the gross bed need for each jurisdiction of care by dividing the target patient days for the jurisdiction by the product of 365 and 0.95. 7. Calculate the net need for each jurisdiction of care by subtracting the inventory of beds from the gross bed need for the jurisdiction. 8. Calculate the number of nursing home beds for which adult day care slots will substitute in each jurisdiction of care by multiplying together the number of nursing home patient days appropriate for adult day care, by area of origin, the participation rate in adult day care by persons who would otherwise use nursing homes, and dividing the result by the product of 365 and 0.95. 9. Calculate the adjusted bed need for each jurisdiction of care by subtracting the number of nursing home beds for which adult day care slots will substitute from the net bed need for each jurisdiction of care.  79"

What is the difference between a senior center and senior center plus?              Our Senior Centers offer programs of interest to active and independent older people.  Seniors can choose to attend based on their interest in the offered programs and are expected to be able to attend the Center without supervision.  Small fees are requested to cover the costs of some activities and a lunch donation is requested.              Senior Center Plus serves seniors who need assistance with activities of daily living such as toileting and eating, and must be supervised during their attendance at the Center.  Activities are therapeutically structured to maintain functional independence and cognitive awareness.  Participants are screened for appropriateness for the program and pay a daily program fee, as well as a monthly activity fee.  High staff ratios maintain safe assistance to the participants.              How do I join a Senior/50+ Center?              When new participants visit a Center or arrive for their first Center program, they are requested to complete a Registration Form.  This one page form provides vital information for: 1) emergency contacts, 2) continued funding and programming for the County, and 3) Center mailings and newsletters.  There is no cost to register or become a member and participants receive an identification card.  Once registered, participants can select activities, join classes and register for lunch and trips.              How do I register for transportation in Howard County?

Is there help in reducing or paying for high prescription drug costs?              Yes, there is help.  Many pharmaceutical companies are now participating in Pharmaceutical Company Patient Assistance Programs.  These programs are privately administered by individual pharmaceutical companies, require an application process, and are often based on income eligibility.  The State of Maryland has implemented a free program called MEDBANK of MARYLAND, which assists healthcare providers and patients in completing the paperwork required to enroll in the Pharmaceutical Company Patient Assistance Programs.  To find out more about how these programs work, or to get the enrollment process started call MEDBANK of MARYLAND, INC. at (410) 821-9262.              For those people who have a limited monthly income, the Maryland Pharmacy Assistance Program is available to you with co-pays of $5.00 per prescription.  To find out more about this program and its guidelines call the Senior Information and Assistance Program,  (410) 313-7212, or email at  aging@co.ho.md.us .              Where can I find financial help for the in-home services I need to care for myself or my loved one?              There are many Federal, State, and local programs that offer some financial assistance to people who are income eligible.  These programs include the Medicaid Waiver Program for Older Adults, Senior Care, and Medical Assistance.  To find out if you may qualify for these programs, contact the Senior Information and Assistance Program at (410) 313-7212, or email at  aging@co.ho.md.us .              The Office on Aging has limited grant funds that can be applied to emergency situations, and on an individual, case by case basis to those seniors in need.  These funds can be used for eyeglasses, utility cut-offs, prescriptions, and some in-home care services.              What is a Medical Adult Day Care and are there any such programs located in Howard County?              Medical Adult Day Care is a term for on-site programs that offer supervision, health care management and social activities to adults who are frail or with special disabilities that require constant attention.  These services are provided in a protective setting by trained staff, who assist clients with socialization and activities of daily living, such as eating, exercise, and hygiene.              Currently, in Howard County there are two Medical Adult Day Care Programs.  For more information about these programs, contact the Howard County Office on Aging at (410) 313-7212, or email at  aging@co.ho.md.us .              What is the Medicaid Home and Community Based Waiver for Older Adults and who is eligible?              The Medicaid Waiver enables older adults to remain in a community setting even though their advanced age or disability would warrant placement in a long-term care facility.  The Waiver allows services that are typically covered by Medicaid only in long-term care facilities to be provided to eligible persons in their own homes or in assisted living facilities.  Under a Medicaid Waiver, the federal government ""waives"" certain requirements it imposes on states, such as the requirement that services be provided in a nursing facility.  For eligible clients, the State will pay for covered services to enable them to stay in the community.  Eligibility is based on three requirements:                            the clients need to be at least 50 years of age;               their income must not exceed $1,635 per month with assets at or below $2,500;               they must meet Medicaid's long-term care admission criteria.                          For more information about this program, or to get an application contact the Office on Aging at (410) 313-6495, or email at  aging@co.ho.md.us .              What is the difference between a nursing home and an assisted living facility?              A nursing home provides skilled nursing services as well as maintenance care. Individuals requiring only assistance with activities of daily living, but who do not require some level of medical care, and are not appropriate for nursing home placement.  Staff training requirements are much more stringent in nursing homes then in assisted living facilities, due to the high level of medical necessity. Medicare only pays for skilled nursing services, in long term care facilities, such as nursing homes.  Medicaid will pay for long term care for individuals in nursing homes, but they must qualify both financially and medically.              Assisted living facilities provide assistance with activities of daily living as well as medication management.  They normally do not provide skilled nursing functions.  Assisted living facilities are licensed by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH) and regulated under the Code of Maryland 10.07.14.  Small assisted living facilities, or group homes, while licensed by DHMH, are monitored by the Office on Aging Housing Program in their respective counties.  They all abide by the same standards of care and differ in the number of residents they can legally and successfully manage.  Generally, group homes care for between 1 and 16 residents, while the larger assisted living facilities care for any number above 16 residents.              What are the income guidelines for financial assistance for programs in Howard County?              (insert guidelines grid)              What is an ACES evaluation, who is eligible, and how can I get evaluated?              The State of Maryland has programs in each county to give information to help disabled and frail adults remain as independent as possible in a safe setting.  In Howard County, we talk with people by phone or make home visits to understand what is needed and to look at the resources available for appropriate care.  If a person is experiencing difficulty is maintaining themselves independently in their own home Adult Community Evaluation Services (ACES) may be able to help, by providing an in-home assessment and by making recommendations for helpful changes.  This is a free evaluation service and is available to any Howard County resident who is finding it difficult to remain independent in their own home without support.  To find out more about this service or to make an appointment for an evaluation call (410) 313-7212, or email at  aging@co.ho.md.us .              How do I get help for an older person who is neglected or in danger?              Adult Protective Services, a division of the Howard County Department of Social Services, assists in the recognition of the abuse or neglect of adults, aged 18 and older.  If you suspect that someone is being physically, emotionally, psychologically, or financially abused or neglected you can contact Adult Protective Services to have the incident investigated.  Callers may remain anonymous, or if you wish to be identified, notification will be sent to you that your concerns were addressed.  To contact Adult Protective Services call the Howard County Department of Social Services at (410) 872-4200.              I am new to Howard County.  How do I find out about the services and programs available to me?              The best place to find out about services and programs for seniors is at your local senior center.  Stop by and discover what the Howard County Office on Aging has to offer, as well as the surrounding community.  And if your local senior center cannot answer your questions, then they certainly know where to direct you.  If traveling to your local senior center is inconvenient for you, please call the Senior Information & Assistance Program at (410) 313-7212.  The knowledgeable and courteous Senior Information & Assistance staff will do their best to supply you with the information you need.  You can also use email to ask us a question at  aging@co.ho.md.us .

Forty to eighty percent of patients either fail to respond or only partially respond to conventional          antipsychotic agents. Secondary symptoms may be unimproved even in patients who respond to treatment. A variety of adverse          events occur in patients receiving currently available agents. The severity of these events contributes to the poor compliance          that is observed in this patient population. Olanzapine is a novel antipsychotic agent with a reduced incidence of extrapyramidal          symptoms. Other side effects are minimal.

Secondary Hypothesis: Secondary objectives include evaluation of clinical efficacy, safety, social and vocational functioning,             family burden, compliance and satisfaction for olanzapine relative to haloperidol.                                         Intervention: Olanzapine (5 mg to 20 mg/day), haloperidol (5 mg to 20 mg/day).                               Primary Outcomes: Total inpatient hospital care costs are the primary outcome. Other major outcomes are total social costs             (cost of VA health care, non-VA services and other specified social costs), efficacy measures (PANNS, BPRS, CGI Severity,             and neurocognitive battery scores) and safety measures (adverse events, ECG’s).                                         Study Abstract: Although currently marketed antipsychotic drugs are useful in the treatment of schizophrenia, efficacy and             safety profiles need to be improved. Forty to eighty percent of patients either fail to respond or only partially respond             to conventional antipsychotic agents. Secondary symptoms may be unimproved even in patients who respond to treatment. A variety             of adverse events occur in patients receiving currently available agents. The severity of these events contributes to the             poor compliance that is observed in this patient population. Olanzapine is a novel antipsychotic agent with a reduced incidence             of extrapyramidal symptoms. Other side effects are minimal.                                         Approximately 327 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups.             One treatment group was prescribed olanzapine with daily dosage ranging from 5 mg/day to 20 mg/day. The other treatment group             was prescribed haloperidol with daily dosage also ranging from 5 mg/day to 20 mg/day. A semi-structured psychosocial case             management treatment program is provided for all study patients. Patients were recruited from 18 VA medical centers over a             24-month period and will be followed for one year. The major objective of the study is to determine if olanzapine is more             cost effective than haloperidol. Secondary objectives include evaluation of clinical efficacy, safety, social and vocational             functioning, family burden, compliance and satisfaction for olanzapine relative to haloperidol.

From age 13, Marie Zakrzewska accompanied her mother, a midwife, on her rounds, and at age 20 she enrolled in midwifery studies at theRoyal Charité hospital in Berlin, where her mother had trained. Opportunities for women were scarce, but thanks to the support of Joseph Hermann Schmidt, professor of obstetrics and the director of the school of midwifery, Marie Zakrzewska was promoted to head midwife in 1852, despite the disapproval of other faculty and not long after she finished her own training. After six months as head of midwifery, she moved to the United States to study medicine.                                                                                    In 1862, Marie Zakrzewska, M.D., opened doors to women physicians who were excluded from clinical training opportunities at male-run hospitals, by establishing the first hospital in Boston—and the second hospital in America—run by women, the New England Hospital for Women and Children.    Marie Zakrzewska was born in Berlin in 1829, to Ludwig Martin Zakrzewski and Caroline Fredericke Wilhelmina Urban. Her father was a civil servant from a noble Polish family, who had lost their wealth and property to the Russians in 1793. Her grandmother was a veterinary surgeon, and her mother worked as a midwife. From age 13, Marie Zakrzewska accompanied her mother on her rounds, and at age 20 she enrolled in midwifery studies at the Royal Charité hospital in Berlin, where her mother had trained. Opportunities for women were scarce, but thanks to the support of Joseph Hermann Schmidt, professor of obstetrics and the director of the school of midwifery, Marie Zakrzewska was promoted to head midwife in 1852, despite the disapproval of other faculty and not long after she finished her own training. After six months as head of midwifery, she moved to the United States to study medicine.    Marie Zakrzewska emigrated to New York in March 1853. During her first year in America she found little support for a career in medicine among the male practitioners she met. Encouraged by Dr.  Elizabeth Blackwell , she enrolled at a traditionally all-male medical school, Cleveland's Western Reserve College, in 1854. She was one of only six women admitted to the school during the 1850s, and she graduated with a doctor of medicine degree in 1856. Like others in this first generation of women physicians, she struggled to find work. Dr. Blackwell and her sister Emily, who was also a doctor, were planning to open a small hospital to care for women and children that would also provide opportunities for work and training for women physicians. Dr. Zakrzewska joined their fundraising effort. On May 12, 1857, they opened the New York Infirmary for Women and Children, and Dr. Marie Zakrzewska served as resident physician there for the next two years.    In March of 1859, Dr. Zakrzewska moved to Boston to become a professor of obstetrics at the New England Female Medical College. Her students experienced the same difficulties that had prompted the founding of the New York Infirmary, and Dr. Zakrzewska struggled to find clinical experience for the new graduates. She also disagreed with Samuel Gregory, the founder of the New England Female Medical College, over the curriculum. She had proposed adding courses in dissection and microscopy, to enhance student training and keep up with the developing field of scientific medicine as it was taught at the best all-male medical schools, but Gregory was determined to confine women physicians to work in midwifery.    In 1862, Dr. Zakrzewska resigned from the New England Female Medical College and launched her own hospital, the New England Hospital for Women and Children. It was the first in Boston, and the second hospital in America, to be run by women physicians and surgeons. The hospital flourished under her direction, providing clinical experience for women physicians. Dr. Zakrzewska knew that the opportunity to work with large numbers of patients was vital if women physicians were to achieve the same levels of training and standards of practice as male physicians. The hospital became a primary training hospital for several generations of women physicians, and also trained nurses.    The New England Hospital for Women and Children grew rapidly, though budgets were always tight, and the hospital had to hold yearly fund-raising fairs. By the 1940s it occupied a large campus in south Boston, continuing to serve poorer populations and to train physicians and nurses. Dr. Zakrzewska's hospital continues to serve patients today, as the Dimock Community Health Center.

Medical Encyclopedia: Doctor of medicine profession (MD)     URL of this page:  http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001936.htm         Alternative names                            M.D. profession     Information                       The practice of medicine in the United States dates back to colonial times (early 1600s). At the beginning of the 17th century, medical practice in England was divided into three distinct groups: the physicians, the surgeons, and the apothecaries.       Physicians were viewed as elite and usually held a university degree. Surgeons, in contrast, were typically apprenticed and hospital trained and often served the dual role of barber-surgeon. Apothecaries also learned their roles prescribing, making, and selling medicines, through apprenticeships and sometimes within hospitals.       This distinction between medicine, surgery, and pharmacy did not survive in colonial America. University-prepared MDs from England, upon their arrival in America, were expected to also perform surgery and prepare medicines. The class distinctions and snobbishness associated with physicians over surgeons quickly became diluted.       The New Jersey Medical Society, chartered July 23, 1766, was the first organization of medical professionals in the colonies. It was developed to ""form a program embracing all the matters of highest concern to the profession: regulation of practice; educational standards for apprentices; fee schedules; and a code of ethics."" Later this organization became the Medical Society of New Jersey and, having survived numerous obstacles, remains the oldest medical society in the United States.       The regulation of medical practice, by examining and licensing practitioners, was initiated by professional societies through provincial legislatures as early as 1760. By the early 1800s, the establishment of regulations, standards of practice, and certification of doctors was firmly in the hands of the medical societies.       A natural next step was for such societies to develop their own training programs for doctors. These society-affiliated programs were called ""proprietary"" medical colleges.       The first of these proprietary programs was the medical school of the Medical Society of the County of New York, founded March 12, 1807. Proprietary programs began to spring up everywhere and attracted a large number of students because they eliminated two features of university-affiliated medical schools: a long general education and a long lecture term.       To address numerous abuses within medical education, a national convention was held in May 1846. Proposals from that convention included the following:                         The creation of a national medical association                           The adoption of uniform higher educational standards for MDs, including suitable courses of premedical education                           A standard code of ethics for the profession                     On May 5, 1847, nearly 200 delegates representing 40 medical societies and 28 colleges within 22 states and the District of Columbia convened and resolved themselves into the first session of the American Medical Association (AMA). Nathaniel Chapman (1780-1853) was elected as the first president of the association. The AMA was maintained and has grown to become a formidable organization capable of exerting a great deal of influence on issues related to health care within the United States.       Initial educational standards for MDs, set by the AMA, included the following:                         A liberal education in the arts and sciences                           A certificate of training completion from the preceptor over apprenticeship prior to medical-college entrance                           An MD degree that encompassed 3 years of study, including two 6-month lecture sessions, 3 months devoted to dissection, and a minimum of one 6-month session of hospital attendance                     In 1852 the standards were revised to incorporate additional requirements:                         Medical schools had to provide a 16-week course of instruction that included anatomy, medicine, surgery, midwifery, and chemistry.                           Graduates had to be at least 21 years of age.                           Students had to complete a minimum of 3 years of study, two of which were under an acceptable practitioner.                     Between 1802 and 1876, 62 fairly stable medical schools were established. In 1810, there were 650 students enrolled and 100 graduates from medical schools in the United States. By 1900, these numbers had risen to 25,000 students and 5,200 graduates. Nearly all of these graduates were white males.       Daniel Hale Williams (1856-1931) was one of the first black MDs. After graduating from Northwestern University in 1883, Dr. Williams practiced in Chicago and was later a primary force in establishing Provident Hospital, which still serves Chicago's South Side.       Elizabeth Blackwell (1821-1920), upon graduating from Geneva College of Medicine in upstate New York, became the first woman granted an MD degree in the United States.       The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine opened in 1893. It is cited as being the first medical school in America of ""genuine university-type, with adequate endowment, well-equipped laboratories, modern teachers devoted to medical investigation and instruction, and its own hospital in which the training of physicians and healing of sick persons combined to the optimal advantage of both."" Johns Hopkins Medical School served as a model for the reorganization of medical education.       By 1930, nearly all medical schools required a liberal arts degree for admission and provided a 3- to 4-year graded curriculum in medicine and surgery. In addition, many states also required candidates for medical licensure to have completed a 1-year internship in a hospital setting in addition to possessing a degree from a recognized medical school.       The emergence of specialization within American medicine did not take root until the middle of the 19th century. People who objected to specialization said that ""specialties operated unfairly toward the general practitioner, implying that he is incompetent to properly treat certain classes of diseases"" and that specialization tended ""to degrade the general practitioner in the view of the public."" However, as the base of knowledge within medicine continued to grow and many doctors chose to do more of what they were interested in and good at, specialization became inevitable.       Economics may have also played an important role as the specialists typically enjoyed higher incomes than did the generalist physicians. The debates between specialists and generalists continue and have recently been fueled by issues related to modern health care reform.       Medicine was the first of the professions to require licensure. State laws specific to the licensure of medicine outlined the activities of ""diagnosis"" and ""treatment"" of human conditions strictly within the domain of medicine. Any individual who professed to ""diagnose"" and/or ""treat"" as part of his/her profession could therefore be charged with ""practicing medicine without a license."" As a result of strict licensure laws that were promulgated by the various medical societies, conventional ""Western"" medicine was able to establish itself as a monopoly over the health care of the American populace.       SCOPE OF PRACTICE  The practice of medicine includes the diagnosis, treatment, correction, advisement, or prescription for any human disease, ailment, injury, infirmity, deformity, pain or other condition, physical or mental, real or imaginary.       PRACTICE SETTINGS  MDs may be found within a wide range of practice settings including private practices, group practices, hospitals, health maintenance organizations, teaching facilities, and public health organizations.       REGULATION OF THE PROFESSION  Medicine, like many other professions, is regulated at two different levels:                         Licensure is a process that takes place at the state level in accordance with specific state laws.                           Certification is established through a national organization(s) with requirements for minimal professional practice standards being consistent nationally.                     Licensure: All states require applicants for MD licensure to be graduates of an approved medical school and complete the USMLE (United States Medical Licensing Exam) Steps 1-3. Steps 1 and 2 are completed while in medical school and step 3 is completed after some medical training (usually between 12-18 months, depending on the state). People who obtained their medical degress in other countries also must satisfy these requirements before practicing medicine in the Unted States.       With the inception of telemedicine, there has been concern as to how to handle state licensure issues when medicine is being shared between states through telecommunications. Laws and guidelines are being addressed.       Certification: MDs who wish to specialize must complete an additional 3 to 4 years of postgraduate work within their area of specialty and then pass board certification examinations. Doctors who claim to practice within one of the specialties should therefore be ""board certified"" within that specific area of practice.       See also types of health care providers.

GX256-60-1024701	"Testimony Before the NCVHS subcommittee on Standards and Security Regarding Coding for Naturopathic Medical Services 1/29/03 Konrad Kail, P.A., N.D. Director Southwest College Research Institute Tempe, AZ (602) 363-9237 kkail@cox.net I would like to thank the Chairman and members of the subcommittee for the opportunity to bring testimony before you. I am a naturopathic physician and have a family practice in Phoenix, Arizona. I am a member of the Advisory Council to the NIH National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. I am also the liaison to the Cancer Advisory Panel for Complementary and Alternative Medicine at the National Institutes of Health. I am involved in several multispecialty health networks and co-manage patients with conventional physicians. I am here on behalf of the American Association of Naturopathic Medical Colleges (located here in Washington D.C.) and the Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine and Health Sciences located in Tempe, Arizona. This submission discusses the training, licensure, practice and insurance reimbursement of naturopathic physicians. Naturopathic physicians provide primary care for patients of all ages. We utilize conventional diagnostic techniques including physical examination, laboratory evaluation, diagnostic imaging and pathologic diagnosis. Assessment may include determination of nutritional status and toxic burden. Additionally, the patient's mental, emotional, social and spiritual status is evaluated. Traditional naturopathic therapeutics include lifestyle interventions, the prescription of natural medicines of animal, mineral and plant origin, therapeutic diet, homeopathy, physical modalities and counseling. Naturopathic physicians are also trained to provide in office minor surgical procedures, administer vaccinations and prescribe a range of drugs. We refer for evaluation and management   by specialists, using the same criteria as conventional primary care providers. Naturopathic physicians meet public health requirements and in utilizing a primary care model, work with a multi-specialty referral network of other providers. A natural evolution of naturopathic care models has resulted in the emergence of integrated clinics that include the full gamut of licensed provider types (ND, MD, DO, DC, LAc, ARNP, LM, ...). Naturopathic principles of care and philosophy serve as the bases for naturopathic practice and guide the practitioner in utilizing the least invasive, most efficacious and cost effective level of intervention. The goals of care include direct patient management, education in self-care, disease prevention and health promotion through restoration of normal physiology to the greatest extent possible. Evaluation and management, as well as procedure codes, ideally describe the actual service provided. It is hoped that an understanding of how naturopathic physicians practice will aid in the code development process undertaken here by the committee. Naturopathic Medicine Naturopathic Medicine is a unique and distinct system of health care that emphasizes the use of prevention and natural therapeutics. The doctors who practice naturopathic medicine, called naturopathic physicians (NDs), are trained to serve as primary care general practitioners who are experts in the prevention, diagnosis, management, and naturopathic treatment of both acute and chronic health conditions. In the United States, the naturopathic profession's infrastructure is based on accredited educational institutions, professional licensing by a growing number of states, national standards of practice and care, peer review, and an ongoing commitment to state-of-the-art scientific research. Modern American naturopathic physicians receive extensive training in and use therapies that are primarily natural and nontoxic, including clinical nutrition, homeopathy, botanical medicine, hydrotherapy, physical medicine, and counseling. Many NDs have   additional training and certification in acupuncture and childbirth. Naturopathic physicians practice medicine as health care providers and are increasingly acknowledged as in bringing about progressive changes in the nation's medical  natural primary leaders system.  Without exception, all laws that have licensed naturopathic physicians (both historically and currently) establish educational standards that are recognized as the highest available when the laws were enacted. Naturopathic physicians are trained at accredited, four-year, postgraduate, residential naturopathic medical programs. Today, the highest educational standard available for the naturopathic profession is graduation from a four-year, residential naturopathic medical school that has been accredited by the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education. The traditionally regulated scope of practice for a licensed naturopath has remained consistent since the profession's founding in the early 1900's although some changes have been made to reflect societal changes and scientific advances. The naturopathic physician's scope of practice continues to include diagnosis and treatment of patients by using light, air, water (hydrotherapy), botanical medicine, homeopathy, clinical nutrition, physical medicine, and lifestyle counseling. Naturopathic medicine is defined by its fundamental principles. Methods and modalities are selected and applied based upon these principles in relationship to the individual needs of each patient. Diagnostic and therapeutic methods are selected from various sources and systems, and will continue to evolve with the progress of knowledge.  The earliest doctors and healers worked with herbs, foods, water, fasting, and tissue manipulation - gentle treatments that do not obscure the body's own healing powers. Today's naturopathic physicians continue to use these therapies as their main tools and to advocate a healthy dose of primary prevention. In addition, NDs conduct and make practical use of the latest biochemical research   involving nutrition, botanicals, homeopathy, and other natural treatments. For many diseases and conditions (a few examples are ulcerative colitis, asthma, menopause, flu, obesity, and chronic fatigue), treatments used by naturopathic physicians can be primary and even curative. Naturopathic physicians also function within an integrated framework, for example referring patients to an appropriate medical specialist such as an oncologist or a surgeon. Naturopathic therapies can be employed within that context to complement the treatments used by conventionalphysicians. The result is a team-care approach that recognizes the best overall treatment most appropriate to the patient's specific medical condition. The current scope of naturopathic practice includes, but is not limited to: Clinical Nutrition       That food is the best medicine is a cornerstone of naturopathic practice. Many medical conditions can be treated more effectively with foods and nutritional supplements than they can by other means, with fewer complications and side effects. Naturopathic physicians use dietetics, natural hygiene, and nutritional supplementation in practice. The discovery of vitamins, minerals and deficiency diseases in the early part of the 20th century began to provide a scientific understanding of clinical nutrition. The realization that enzyme systems were dependent on essential nutrients provided the naturopathic profession with great insights into the importance of an organically grown, whole foods diet for health. Nutritional biochemist Roger Williams' formulation of the concept of biochemical individuality in l955 further developed insights into the unique nutritional needs of each individual, how to correct in-born errors of metabolism, and even how to treat specific diseases through the use of nutrient-rich foods or large dosages of specific nutrients. Linus Pauling, two-time Nobel Prize winner, coined the concept of orthomolecular medicine,       and provided further theoretical substantiation for the use of nutrients as therapeutic agents."" Naturopathic physicians are the only health care professionals that meet and exceed the recommendations of formerUS Surgeon General Koop for education in nutrition. Naturopathic physicians frequently use nutritional supplements as part of a patient's treatment. The dietary approach to prevention and treatment of chronic degenerative disease, championed for more than a century by naturopathic physicians, has recently gained the attention of conventional medicine. Each of the seven dietary guidelines in the 1988 U.S. Surgeon General's report on nutrition and health is a traditional part of naturopathic practice. More than 40 scientific journals worldwide are devoted to clinical nutrition, and articles on the therapeutic use of diet or supplements also appear regularly in conventional medical journals.  Botanical Medicine         Many plant substances are powerful medicines. Where single chemically derived drugs may only address a specific problem, botanical medicines are able to address a variety of problems simultaneously. Their organic nature makes botanicals compatible with the body's own chemistry; hence, they can be gently effective with few toxic side effects. Naturopathic physicians use plant material for food, medicine and health promotion. Formal training includes plant identification, preparation, storage, therapeutic indications, contraindications and dosing. There is extensive contemporary medical literature on medicinal and healing plants. Nothing in naturopathic licensing laws prevents the use of plant medicines by any other individual or group. Most European countries recognize the effectiveness of medicinal plants, include them in their official pharmacopoeias and regulate them as drugs or over-the-counter remedies. At least 14 scientific journals worldwide are devoted to the study of botanical medicine. Naturopathic Formulary: Naturopathic formulary is usually a part of rules and regulations rather than law that list those prescriptive substances which naturopathic physicians use in     practice. Much of the prescriptive pharmacy is based on naturally derived substances. Further, giving naturopathic physicians prescriptive rights saves patients money and time by not requiring a visit to another physician when a simple prescription is indicated. Giving a regulatory board the ability to create the list, the formulary, clarifies to legislators, pharmacists, naturopathic physicians and other practitioners the legal scope of naturopathic prescribing. The list is composed of those substances that are in the traditional pharmacopoeia of naturopathic medicine. The curriculum of naturopathic medical schools includes extensive training in clinical pharmacology. Courses cover the use of legend drugs as well as nonprescription agents, botanicals, antibiotics, hormones, vitamins and minerals.  Homeopathic Medicine         Homeopathic medicine is based on the principle of ""like cures like."" It works on a subtle yet powerful electromagnetic level, gently acting to strengthen the body's healing and immune response. Homeopathic medicines are made from natural substancesand stimulate the body's immune and defense system to initiate the healing process. Naturopathic medical schools teach homeopathic therapeutics as a standard part of the curriculum. Naturopathic schools offer training in homeopathy to the same high standard of Canadian or European schools. Homeopathy is a system of medicine more than two hundred years old and there are more than one hundred homeopathic medical colleges worldwide. A recent review article in the British Medical Journal performed a meta-analysis of 107 controlled clinical trials of homeopathic substances, and found positive evidence supporting their effectiveness (Kleijnen; see also: Alibeu; Ferley; Gassinger; Gibson; Maiwald; Reilly; Vozianov; Weisenauer). In the most significant and comprehensive review of homeopathic research ever conducted, The Lancet published a meta-analysis of 89 blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials and concluded that the homeopathic medicines in the studies had a 2.45 times greater effect than placebo. The authors of the research include Klaus Linde, MD, and Wayne Jonas, MD, former director of the NIH Office   of Alternative Medicine.  (The Lancet, September 20, 1997 Various other in vitro or animal studies have also demonstrated the effectiveness of homeopathic preparations (Bildet; Poitevin; Sukul; Wagner).  Physical Medicine           Naturopathic Medicine has its own methods of therapeutic manipulation of muscles, bones, and spine. NDs also use ultrasound, diathermy, exercise, massage, water, heat and cold, air, and gentle electrical pulses. Naturopathic Manipulative Therapy (NMT) has been an integral part of the practice of naturopathic medicine since the founding of the naturopathic profession, and throughout its existence. It is part of every current naturopathic licensing law. Manipulative therapy is a large, international, interdisciplinary science practiced by a multitude of professions. This is important to understand because some systems of medicine want to co-opt manipulative therapy for their exclusive use. The chiropractic system of spinal adjustment is only one of many systems of spinal manipulation, as is NMT. Naturopathic manipulative therapy is performed and prescribed as a ""therapy"". That is, it is used for a specified therapeutic effect and is not conceived of as the final act of anatomical approximation of a displaced bone. Rather, it is conceived of as dynamic process having specific therapeutic benefits. The training of naturopathic physicians in NMT and related fields is extensive. Students receive approximately 348 hours of instruction in NMT. Of these, 132 hours are devoted strictly to the hands-on learning of technique. In addition, elective course work is available for students wishing greater expertise in this area. Naturopathic manipulation of the muscles, bones and soft tissues is collectively known as Naturopathic Manipulative Therapy (NMT). Physical medicine also includes exercise therapy, physiotherapy using heat and cold, electrical pulsation, ultrasound, diathermy and hydrotherapy. Such techniques are regularly evaluated in journals such as the Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapies. A recent study in England found manipulative treatment to be more effective than orthodox medical treatment for certain kinds of back injuries   (Meade). The value of such treatments is recognized in other licensed professions such as physical therapy, osteopathy, chiropractic, and massage therapy. Hydrotherapy       Hydrotherapy is the use of hot and cold water for the maintenance of health and treatment of disease. These are therapies that stimulate circulation and healing, often with the only other effect being cleanliness. Naturopathic medicine is in part rooted in the European hydrotherapy movement, centuries old and still thriving. The best-known American hydropath was John Harvey Kellogg, a medical doctor who approached hydrotherapy scientifically and performed many experiments to determine the physiological effects of hot and cold water. His book, Rational Hydrotherapy, is considered one of the definitive texts on the therapeutic effects of water. It also has an extensive discussion of the actual techniques. The value of water treatments, fasting and rest in treatment for chronic disease is recognized throughout the developed countries in Europe. About a half million French citizens each year receive insurance reimbursement for medically prescribed spa therapy.  Acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine   Acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) are complimentary healing philosophy to naturopathic medicine. Meridian theory offers an important understanding of the unity of the body and mind, and adds to the Western understanding of physiology. Acupuncture provides a method of treatment, which can unify and harmonize the imbalances present in disease conditions, which, if untreated, can result in illness. The eclectic base of the modern naturopathic practices offers simple, effective acupuncture treatments for a wide variety of health problems. NDs are trained with entry-level acupuncture competency. Many continue studies that certify them as specialists.       An individual naturopathic physician may or may not have the same in-depth training as an acupuncturist, who is the kind of specialist to which referrals are made. Every ND receives appropriate training to utilize acupuncture in an eclectic practice. An ND wanting to specialize in acupuncture will have training similar to any other acupuncturists at the level required for certification by the National Commission on the Certification of Acupuncturists. All naturopathic physicians are trained at an introductory level in the basics of Oriental medicine, and about one in five receives further training and specializes in it. Oriental medicine has been developed continuously for more than three thousand years in Asia and coexists along with conventional medicine today in China and Japan as a primary form of medicine. Dozens of peer-reviewed journals are devoted to the scientific evaluation of Oriental methods, including both acupuncture and botanical medicine.  Naturopathic Obstetrics     Naturopathic physicians provide natural childbirth care in an out-of-hospital setting. They offer prenatal and postnatal care using modern diagnostic techniques. The naturopathic approach strengthens healthy body functions so that complications associated with pregnancy may be prevented. Naturopathic physicians have a long history in safe at home childbirth. Those naturopathic physicians certified in the specialty of naturopathic obstetrics (natural childbirth) are trained to perform the following: Episiotomy, including its repair Repair of current obstetric laceration of cervix Repair of other current obstetric laceration (includes only repair of perineum, vagina, and vulva) Circumcision, in newborns only  Mind-Body Medicine   Mental attitudes and emotional states may influence, or even cause, physical illness. Counseling, nutritional balancing, stress       management, hypnotherapy, biofeedback, and other therapies are used to help patients heal on the psychological level. The training of naturopathic physicians includes counseling. The ND must be able to talk with patients in a constructive way about lifestyle, stresses, and habits. As a rule, naturopathic physicians spend one half to one and a half hours with a patient on the first visit. They gather a medical history, as well as a family history. They get data on lifestyle and stress, means of relaxation, diet, and exercise. They ask the patient when each symptom began and what was happening in his or her life at the time. They try to uncover the cause or causes of the symptoms or imbalance and to discover the blocks that keep the patient from necessary change. Again, nothing in any naturopathic licensing bill interferes with the scope of any other practitioner. Naturopathic physicians are trained in various psychological techniques, including basic counseling, stress management, hypnotherapy, biofeedback, and methods of lifestyle modification. A large body of scientific literature points to the importance of treatment for psychological and somatic factors and coping mechanisms in many illnesses and complaints.  Minor Surgery     As general practitioners, NDs do in office-minor surgery including repair of superficial wounds, removal of foreign bodies, cysts, and other superficial masses. Naturopathic physicians are primary care doctors and need the limited authority to remove foreign objects (excepting from areas that are higher risk and require specialty training). We take slivers out of kid's hands. When trained in obstetrics stitching episiotomies are necessary. Most naturopathic physicians refer most minor surgery.  The following represents the general scope of naturopathic minor surgery. All licensable naturopathic physicians are trained to perform the following:   A. Operations on skin and subcutaneous tissue            1. Incision of the skin and subcutaneous tissue (example: Aspiration of abscesses, hematomas, and seromas of the nail, skin or subcutaneous tissue; incision of pilonidal sinus or cyst; other incision with drainage of skin and subcutaneous tissue [excludes fascial compartments of face and mouth, palmer and thenar space]; incision with removal of foreign body form skin and subcutaneous; other incision of skin and subcutaneous tissue [exploration of sinus tracts, skin, subficial fossa and the undercutting of hair follicles; excludes fascial compartments of face and mouth, palmer and thenar space]). 2. Excision or destruction of lesion or tissue of skin and subcutaneous tissue (example: Debridement of wound, infection, or burn [includes only minor wounds, infections or burns]; removal of nail, nailed, or nail fold; ligation of dermal appendage). 3. Other local excision or destruction of lesion or tissue of skin and subcutaneous tissue (example includes the removal of moles, warts, and cysts; and the destruction of tissue by cauterization, cryosurgery, fulguration, or laser beam. Excludes Z- plasty]). 4. Suture of skin and subcutaneous tissue (example: replantation of scalp, including suturing of incisions, excisions, and minor wounds of the scalp; suture of skin and subcutaneous tissue of other sites, including suturing of incision, excisions, and minor wounds). B. Lingual frenotomy, excluding lingual frenectomy. C. Labial frenotomy, excluding labial frenectomy. D. Excision or destruction of lesion or tissue of scrotum (includes only the treatments of benign lesions such as warts). E. Local excision or destruction of lesion of penis (includes only treatment of benign lesion such as warts). F. Destruction of lesion of cervix by cryosurgery (includes only treatment of benign lesions). G. Hymenotomy H. Excision or destruction of lesion of vagina (includes only treatment of benign lesion such as warts). I. Excision or destruction of vulva and perineum (includes only treatment of benign lesions such as warts).       J. Incision or excision of perianal tissue 1. Incision of perianal abscess; 2. Excision of perianal skin tags; 3. Other excision of perianal tissue (includes only treatment of benign lesions such as warts). K. Procedures on hemorrhoids 1. Injection of hemorrhoids; 2. Cauterization of hemorrhoids; 3. Destruction of hemorrhoids by cryotherapy; 4. Ligation of hemorrhoids; 5. Evacuation of thrombosed hemorrhoids.  Diagnostic Imaging       As primary care practitioners Naturopathic physicians have the need access to diagnostic tools used routinely in general practice. These include x-ray, ultrasound, mammography, etc. Often naturopathic physicians do not perform these tests, but need the flexibility to order them. For example: Naturopaths routinely do breast exams, pelvic exams and pap smears. Inability to order a routine mammogram results in additional cost to a patient if she must pay an MD for the visit so that a test can be ordered. It can result in late diagnosis if the patient refuses to see an MD which some do. Naturopathic physicians are trained to follow the reports and refer appropriately as would any primary care physician. The training and testing of naturopathic physicians cover all these procedures. Naturopathic Medicine Education  The degree of Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine requires four years of graduate level study in the basic sciences and clinical medicine, and clinical training. Naturopathic medical colleges are four-year postgraduate schools with admissions requirements comparable to those of conventional medical schools. A minimum of three years of undergraduate premedical study is prerequisite for entry to a naturopathic medical school. The course of study is an intensive   four-year graduate program including approximately 4,500 hours of academic and clinical training. The program leads to licensure as a Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine (ND or NMD in Arizona). It is important to distinguish certified naturopathic physicians from noncertified who have completed just a short-term course-work mostly by correspondence. Naturopathic medicine is at the forefront of the alternative and complementary healthcare movement as it evolves today, and naturopathic physicians are the most comprehensively trained doctors of natural medicine.

Comparing Training in Nutrition Training in nutrition and lifestyle modification, in both classroom and clinical settings, has been part of the core curriculum of naturopathic physicians since the profession was organized in the United States in 1902.

Nursing Doctorate program Licensure of Naturopathic Physicians Naturopathic physicians are licensed in Alaska, Arizona, Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, New Hampshire, Oregon, Utah, Vermont, Washington, and Puerto Rico and have a legal right to practice in Kansas, Idaho and the District of Columbia. Naturopaths also practice in other states without official government sanction; however, without licensing standards individuals with little or no formal education may proclaim themselves naturopathic physicians without medical school education or board testing. The Council of Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME) serves as the programmatic accrediting agency for naturopathic medical programs. Graduates of four-year programs that lead to the Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine degree from accredited or pre-accredited (candidacy) by CNME are eligible to apply for the naturopathic licensing examinations administered by the North American Board of Naturopathic Examiners. A licensed naturopathic physician (ND) attends a four-year graduate level naturopathic medical school and is educated in all of the same basic sciences as an MD but also studies holistic and nontoxic approaches to therapy with a strong emphasis on disease prevention and optimizing wellness. In addition to a standard medical curriculum, the naturopathic physician is required to complete four years of training in clinical nutrition, acupuncture, homeopathic medicine, botanical medicine, psychology, and counseling (to encourage people to make lifestyle changes in support of their personal health). A naturopathic physician takes rigorous professional board exams so that he or she may be licensed by a state or jurisdiction as a primary care general practice physician. Twelve states, and Puerto Rico, license naturopathic physicians. Five of these states have continuously licensed NDs since the early   twentieth century. All the state licensing laws include title protection, exam requirements, general qualification requirements, scope of practice definitions, integration into the public health system through reporting requirements, and creation of peer review mechanisms. An evaluation by an independent body of medical school examiners from the Oregon Office of Educational Policy and Planning drew this conclusion: Naturopathic medical college prepares a ND with biological and biomedical education of the same breadth and depth that prepares a MD to be primary care physician. In states that license naturopathic manage cases with conventional integrating into the established Complaints are few. Malpractice awar medicine, NDs refer and coproviders, and are rapidly healthcare delivery system. ds almost non-existent  In every state that licenses naturopathic doctors, the safety record of the naturopathic profession is superior to that of the allopathic medical profession. Since naturopathic medicine is less invasive therapeutically, it inherently puts the patient at less risk. Further, licensing actually protects the public safety by creating a defined scope of practice, authorizing regulatory oversight and providing recourse for complaints. Licensed NDs can be held to the same public health and OSHA standards as other licensed health care providers. Licensing NDs is consistent with the current practice of licensing other primary care providers, including medical doctors, doctors of chiropractic, osteopathic physicians, and licensed acupuncturists, as well as all other health care providers including dentists, optometrists, nurses, etc. The American Association of Naturopathic Physicians (AANP) is the only national professional association in the U.S. for licensed and licensable NDs. The AANP strongly believes in and advocates for state licensing of naturopathic physicians in all 50 states. Insurance Coverage for Naturopathic Physicians State and provincial government audits, insurance company rate policies, and measures of utilization all find naturopathic medicine to   be cost-effective when compared with orthodox medicine and high hospital fees. In 1989, the state of Hawaii audited health costs associated with naturopathic medicine and concluded that there was no evidence that naturopathic medicine increased health care costs. (""Study of proposed mandatory health insurance for naturopathic care"", Legislative Auditor of the State of Hawaii. Report # 89-25, December 1989.) The British Columbia government Medical Services Plan audited naturopathic practice in that province in 1988 (MSP). The audit showed naturopathic medicine to be cost-effective and, Minister of Finance Mel Couveleir concluded: ""The government will attempt to control health-care costs by emphasizing holistic and preventive medicine.""   Most people (67%) believe the availability of alternative care is an important selection criterion in their choice of a health plan. Landmark Report on Public Perceptions of Alternative Care, 1998, Landmark Healthcare, Inc. Nearly one-half of adults in the US say they would be willing to increase their monthly health care expenses in order to have access to alternative care. Landmark Report on Public Perceptions of Alternative Care, 1998, Landmark Healthcare, Inc. Audits of naturopathic services and surveys of insurance companies have indicated that naturopathic medicine is less expensive than conventional care, perhaps by as much as half. The actual savings may be much higher, because none of the audits measured the long-term effect of the naturopathic preventive approach in reducing costs associated with serious chronic disease. Naturopathic Medicine: Contribution to Health Care Reform, 1993 American Association of Naturopathic Physicians. Over 70 companies, unions and state organizations have health plans that cover naturopathic medical services.        Naturopathic medicine offers inexpensive therapeutic options to over utilized expensive conventional procedures. Hysterectomy, prostate   surgery, tonsillectomy, myringotomy, and many other procedures have been found by insurance reviewers and other cost-control experts to be frequently overused (Califano; EBRI; Ellwood; Rand). An article in a 1991 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association suggests that medical costs could be reduced by up to 20% by reducing the rate of interventional medicine and unnecessary surgery (Gleicher). 1. At American Western Life, which grosses 54 million a year, insiders say they are already making money with the plan that covers naturopathic services but expect the biggest savings occur in the future because preventive care will help stave off high priced claims. 2. The inclusion of naturopathic medical services, supported by appropriate state and federal laws and regulations, in the array of medical services offered to consumers, may lower overall health costs through increased competition. 3. More than 90 insurance carriers cover naturopathic medicine in the United States and Canada. Also, state legislatures in Connecticut, Hawaii, and Alaska have mandated insurance reimbursement for naturopathic medical services. 4. The Hawaii state Auditor's office hired actuarial firm, the Wyatt Company, to survey 24 underwriters of indemnity medical plans. Wyatt found that most companies do not raise their rates in states where naturopathic physicians are included. Those companies that do raise their rates typically charge an extra one to three cents a month on private plans, and nothing extra on group plans. 5. There is no evidence that NDs drive up utilization inappropriately. Patients who utilize naturopathic services in North American see their physicians about three times per year (AANP). The national average for patients who use M.D.S. is between five and six visits per year, and for a chiropractor about eight visits (HCFA). Patients' visits remain about the same in states without mandatory insurance reimbursement: 3.5 visits per patient in Washington state; 2.5 per patient in Arizona; and 3.6 per patient in North Carolina (AANP).   6. Malpractice suits against naturopathic physicians are extremely rare. Master Insurance Trust reports that in a four-year history involving 50 licensed naturopathic physicians only 4 incidents were reported and nothing was paid in judgment or settlements. 7. Federal commission studying medical malpractice estimated malpractice costs passed from doctor to patient increased 10 fold during the 1970s. These cost have continued to rise with the present 28 billion a year in malpractice representing $400,00 per MD in indirect costs. Medicaid Coverage The majority of state Medicaid programs provide some coverage of alternative therapies for children in low-income families, according to a new study from the University of Michigan. Medicaid representatives from 46 states were interviewed in the study, which reveals that chiropractic is reimbursed in 74 percent of the states, biofeedback in 22 percent, acupuncture in 15 percent, hypnosis in 13 percent, and naturopathy in 11 percent. The states, on average, currently spend less than $500,000 per year on alternative therapies for Medicaid recipients; seven states plan to expand alternative medicine coverage in the next 3 years.

We want you to understand clearly that this is a licensing bill and NOT a bill asking for insurance third party reimbursement. Insurance issues include those of liability insurance for the practitioner and consumer access to insured naturopathic care. Washington State is being watched by the nation following the directive from its insurance commissioner to cover every category of licensed provider. The states of Hawaii, Arizona and Connecticut require insurance parity for naturopathic physicians. In the state of Montana the insurance commissioner's policy is that if coverage for primary care is provided, naturopathic physicians must be covered as the law defines them as practicing a primary care system of medicine. It is important in this time of great concern over health care to remember that ""conventional"" medicine is not a health care system. It is at best an early detection and ""disease management"" system. Because of this, our health care costs get higher and yet we as a population get sicker. This is why one out of every three Americans is seeking an alternative approach to medicine (Eisenburg, NEJM l993). A naturopathic physician is a primary care physician who focuses on wellness and disease prevention.     making naturopathic medicine a service with cost effectiveness making their patients good insurance risks (coverage) because they are concerned with prevention; making naturopaths good risks for professional liability insurance because they have close relationships with patients, use safe therapies and are not performing invasive procedures;     and making naturopathic physicians an obvious part of any managed care system that seeks to assure quality services while limiting costs.  Professional Liability Insurance Naturopathic physicians cannot purchase malpractice insurance in unlicensed states. Wouldn't it protect your constituents for this coverage to be available? Two U.S. insurance companies provide coverage designed for naturopathic physicians. Master Administrative Services, Inc. administers policies for naturopathic physicians located in states that provide licensure to naturopathic physicians. The MGIS Companies administered medical -professional liability insurance designed specifically for naturopathic physicians for eight years. They found the loss experience for naturopathic physicians compares extremely favorably with that of other health care professional classes. Malpractice insurance rates are generally less than $4000.00 per year, indicating the safety of naturopathic treatment as assessed by insurance companies. Master Insurance Trust reports that of the naturopathic physicians for whom MIT provides liability insurance, there have been only four incidents reported to the company for follow-up. However, nothing has been paid in either settlements or judgments on any of these items. ""While this pooling of physicians is much too small to base actuarial considerations, this claims experience is clearly superior."" (Jeffrey D. Brunken, Program Manager, MIT, Letter dated May 21, 1990.) Jury Verdicts Northwest, a legal database which records court cases in Washington and Oregon, the area of the country with the largest number of naturopathic physicians, shows no judgments for malpractice against N.D.s since the database was started in 1983. One in five M.D.s is sued each year in the US (AMA). Naturopathic methods are less likely to cause injury than orthodox methods. Prudent dietary and lifestyle changes, for instance, are unlikely to cause harm. Naturopathic physicians by philosophy and   training use the least invasive means to treat and prevent disease. This results in less injury to patients. Naturopathic physicians also have excellent diagnostic and referral skills. There is no significant history of complaints against naturopathic physicians resulting from a missed diagnosis, the most common cause for suits in a general practice. From insurance data, it appears that naturopathic physicians as a group know the limits of their methods and refer patients to other practitioners or specialists when appropriate.

Medical Encyclopedia: Certified Nurse Midwife profession (CNM)     URL of this page:  http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002000.htm         Alternative names                            Nurse midwife profession     Information                       HISTORY OF THE PROFESSION Nurse-Midwifery in the U.S. dates back to 1925. At that time, Mary Breckenridge developed the Frontier Nursing Service in Kentucky. The program utilized public health registered nurses, who had received additional nurse-midwifery education in England, to staff nursing centers in the Appalachian mountains. The centers offered family health care services in addition to childbearing and delivery care to residents within the region. The first nurse-midwifery education program in the United States was founded in 1932 at the Maternity Center Association of New York City. The program enrolled public health nurses and awarded a certificate in nurse-midwifery to its graduates.   Today, all nurse-midwifery programs are within institutions of higher education. Approximately 70% of nurse-midwives graduate at the Master's degree level. These programs must be accredited by the American College of Nurse-Midwives (ACNM) in order for graduates to be eligible to take the National Certification Examination. There are 47 ACNM accredited nurse-midwifery programs in the United States. Applicants for nurse-midwife programs must be registered nurses and have at least one to two years of nursing experience. As with the nursing profession in general, most CNMs are women. However, in recent years more male nurses have chosen to become nurse-midwives.   Primary health care services for women within underserved populations have been greatly enhanced through the services of nurse-midwives. The National Institute of Medicine has recommended that more reliance be placed upon nurse-midwives for the delivery of women's health care. Numerous studies over the past 20 to 30 years have documented the ability of nurse-midwives to independently manage about 80% of all perinatal (including prenatal, delivery, and postpartum) care and up to 85% of the family planning and gynecological needs of women of all ages. Nurse-midwives work in a collaborative role with OB/GYN physicians and either consult with or refer to other health care providers on cases outside their scope of practice (for example, high-risk pregnancies, women with concurrent chronic disease). See types of health care providers.   SCOPE OF PRACTICE The nurse-midwife is prepared both academically and clinically to provide a broad range of health care services for women and newborns. CNM functions include diagnostic services (history taking, physical assessment, ordering appropriate laboratory test/procedures), therapeutic management (outlining care, providing prescriptions, coordinating consultations and referrals), and health promotion/risk reduction activities. Although the majority of CNM practice may focus on childbearing, family planning, and gynecological care for well women, CNMs may also assess and manage common acute, episodic illnesses in adults. All services are performed in collaboration with the client. As with the nurse practitioner profession (NP), current prescriptive practice privileges for CNMs varies from state to state. Health care management by CNMs includes independent management, consultation or co-management, and referral services.   PRACTICE SETTINGS Certified nurse-midwives may be found in a variety of settings including private outpatient practices (either by themselves or in collaboration with a physician), health maintenance organizations, hospitals, health departments, and freestanding birthing centers. Traditionally, CNMs have provided care to underserved populations in rural areas or inner-city settings.   REGULATION OF THE PROFESSION As with many other professions, certified nurse midwives are regulated at two different levels. Licensure is a process that takes place at the state level in accordance with specific state laws. In contrast, certification is established through a national organization and requirements for minimal professional practice standards are consistent across all states.   Licensure: Much like other advanced practice nurses (such as nurse practitioners), licensure requirements for CNMs may vary somewhat from state to state. The current trend is moving toward requiring master's degree preparation and national certification.   Certification: National certification is required in some states for CNMs to be licensed to practice. Only graduates of nurse-midwifery programs accredited by the American College of Nurse-Midwives (ACNM) are eligible to take the certification exam administered by the ACNM Certification Council, Inc.

Interview Strategy   This study focused on identifying and interviewing individuals from a variety of organizations or programs represented by the following perspectives:    Pharmaceutical companies;  Managed behavioral health care companies;  Health maintenance organizations;  Pharmacy benefit managers;  Employer-provided insurance plans;  Publicly-funded insurance (Medicaid, Veteran's Administration, CHAMPUS);  State Mental Health systems;  Corrections system;  Provider associations; and  Consumer and advocacy groups.      In order to determine which entities or groups should be interviewed under each perspective, a qualitative approach was utilized.  Moreover, the project officers and The Lewin Group team identified specific criteria that were used to select each interview target.  From this criteria, a possible pool of candidates for each type of respondent was generated based on expert recommendations, data collected from the literature and other trade press articles, and personal contacts at the respective entity.  Many of the final interview respondents were self-selected, as interviews with some companies or organizations proved particularly challenging and the project team resorted to alternate candidates.    The information that follows lists the specific criteria for each respondent type and consequently, the final list of candidates.  No delineation is made as to whether the interview respondent was a first, second, or third choice.     A. Pharmaceutical Companies    Pharmaceutical manufacturers were selected based on the following criteria:  1) medium to large size company; and 2) company has current products and products in development in the area of newer atypical antidepressants and/or antipsychotics.  As a result, Janssen, AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly, and GlaxoWellcome (GW) were selected. (1)  GW and Eli Lilly are both large companies with current pharmaceuticals directed toward treating depression.  Eli Lilly also has an atypical antipsychotic on the market to treat schizophrenia.  Medium-sized firms include AstraZeneca and Janssen, both of which offer atypical antipsychotics to treat schizophrenia.  Specialized neuropharmaceutical companies (e.g., Neurogen) do not have products in development beyond Phase I, and were excluded for this reason.   1      1  One pharmaceutical company is not listed for confidentiality reasons.

Managed Behavioral Health Care Organizations   The criteria used to select three managed behavioral health care organizations (MBHCOs) for this study included:      Number of covered lives;  Geographic proximity (in order to fulfill the required two site visits);   Client make-up; and   Involvement in other social service sectors.      As a result, Magellan and Value/Options were selected as they represent the two largest MBHCOs and are located in the Washington, DC metropolitan area which is in close proximity to The Lewin Group offices.  Additionally, Magellan and Value/Options are involved in other sectors, such as the prison system, welfare, and state Medicaid programs.    The third MBHCO, United Behavioral Health, was selected for its client make-up, which favors the private sector (off-setting the large public sector client make-up of Magellan and Value/Options) and because The Lewin Group has an excellent relationship with UBH.      Organization   (Covered Lives)   Reason For Inclusion     Magellan  (65 million)   Largest BHMCO in terms of covered lives   Involvement in States, Welfare, etc.     Value/Options  (22 million)   #2 in terms of covered lives  Involvement with Prison System     United Behavioral Health (UBH)  (16 million)   #3 in terms of covered lives   Higher proportion of private sector clients than others          C. Large Integrated HMOs   In order to examine a more typical arrangement, The Lewin Group decided to focus on integrated health maintenance organizations (HMOs) for this study.  Consequently, The Lewin Group identified participants based on the following criteria:    Receive favorable NCQA ratings;  Offer nationally-recognized behavioral health programs;  Cover over 500,000 lives;   Operate under at least one of the following models: group, staff, network, PPO; and   Operate in geographically diverse regions.    Additionally, the pool of HMOs interviewed were required to represent a variety of financing mechanisms and risk-sharing arrangements (i.e., fee-for-service, capitation) as well as pharmacy management models (i.e., in-house, carve-out).  The final HMOs selected included:  FirstOption, Harvard Pilgrim, HealthPartners, Group Health, and Kaiser Permanente.       HMO   Reason For Inclusion     First Option  (New Jersey)  (250,000, consolidated w/Physicians Health Services as of 1/2000)   Reputation for providing comprehensive coverage and quality care.   Good reputation for substance abuse coverage  Contacts at The Lewin Group   Well-liked in behavioral health community   Reputation for good benefits   Group model and PPO   Carve-out pharmacy benefit     Harvard Pilgrim  (1.6 million)   New England    Group model and PPO   Provide continuum of behavioral health care   Depression screening program for enrollees and non-enrollees   Internally manage pharmacy benefit     HealthPartners (Minnesota)  (800,000)   Midwest   Staff and network models   Provide continuum of behavioral health care   Established collaborative program between behavioral health specialists and primary care physicians   Internally manage pharmacy benefit     Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound  (Washington) (600,000)   Pacific Northwest   Staff and network models   Internally manage pharmacy benefit     Kaiser Permanente Mid-Atlantic (540,000)   Mid-Atlantic   Staff model   Carve-out 10% of pharmacy benefit; remainder is managed internally         D. Pharmaceutical Benefits Managers    The following criteria were used to select the pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) interviewed:      National or regional market presence;  Independently operated or carved out from other entity; and  Linked to other interview respondent type (i.e., employer, Medicaid program).     As a result, five PBMs were identified and interviewed:  Value Rx/Express Scripts, PCS Health System, Rx Innovations, Prescription Solutions, and Advance Paradigm.       Company (Covered Lives)   Reason for Inclusion     Value Rx/Express Scripts  (38.5 million)   National   Independent     PCS Health System  (>50 million)   National     Rx Innovations  (~5,000)   Regional   Carve-out of Value/Options     Prescription Solutions  (>3 million)   Regional   Carve-out of PacifiCare     Advance Paradigm  (27 million)   National   Independent          E. Employers   In order to gain an industry-wide perspective on the approach to behavioral health and pharmacy benefits, The Lewin Group interviewed the William Mercer Corporation.  As a result, the following criteria were identified as necessary characteristics of the employers selected for this study:      Place a high priority on behavioral health;  Provide a range of innovative and flexible benefits (e.g., offer multiple levels of care beyond inpatient and outpatient treatment);  Encourage employees to access behavioral health care;  Represent a geographically diverse group;   Operate national lines of business; and   Self-insure.    From this established criteria, two employers were named:  Motorola and Delta Airlines.  Motorola and Delta were identified as large Fortune 500 employers who self-insure, and with whom The Lewin Group has established contacts.  Motorola presents an interesting perspective as it customized a behavioral health specialist provider network based on employee preferences and past claims data in order to ensure that its employees requiring mental health or substance abuse treatment receive the highest possible quality of care.  On the other hand, Delta Airlines, as a member of the airline industry, faces a variety of challenges specific to pilots.  Namely, federal regulations ground pilots taking psychoactive medications, including standard antidepressants, and often make pilots fearful of seeking any behavioral health treatment.  Delta recognized the special needs of this unique population and has attempted to structure its benefits plan accordingly.        Company  (Covered Lives)   Reason for Inclusion     Motorola  (58,800 employees)   Large employer   Staff at Lewin have worked with Randy Johnson, benefits manager   Reputation for comprehensive and innovative programs   Built its own network for mental health services based on employee input   Pharmacy benefit managed by PBM   Self insure     Delta Airlines (200,000)   Large employer   Network model HMO and FFS   Tailors benefits to specific needs of employees   Pharmacy benefit managed by HMO        F. Federal and State Programs (HCFA(now known as CMS), IHS, CHAMPUS, VA, Medicaid)    The Health Care Financing Administration(now known as Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services(CMS)) (HCFA(now known as CMS)) and the Indian Health Service (IHS) were automatically selected without the use of specific criteria in order to provide a necessary background behind federally-operated and state- or tribally-administered public insurance programs.  More specifically, HCFA(now known as CMS) handles the administration of the publicly funded programs, Medicaid and Medicare.  The IHS is responsible for the Native American population which has a documented prevalence of behavioral health disorders in its communities.  The Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) and the Veteran's Administration (VA) were selected as additional federal interviews, but ones that provide more narrow perspectives, largely dictated by the specific populations served under each program.  Under CHAMPUS, active duty individuals and their dependents along with retirees are covered, while the VA covers those individuals who were in active duty but retired due to a service-related disability or are a dependent of a veteran.  These two perspectives present unique snapshots as Federal programs instituted on an individual basis through treatment facilities (CHAMPUS) or networks (VA).  Additionally, the CHAMPUS viewpoint provides and interesting perspective into the social and cultural issues associated with serving in the military with a diagnosed mental illness.   On the state level, four Medicaid programs were selected based on the following criteria:    Represent geographic diversity;  Offer range of benefits from generous to less comprehensive;   Utilize a variety of reimbursement mechanisms (i.e., managed care, fee-for-service); and   Structure behavioral health and pharmaceutical services in different ways (i.e., integrated, carve-out).       As such, California, Georgia, Texas, and Wisconsin were selected.  Each state handles the administration of its behavioral health and pharmacy benefit in a slightly different manner and  each state has different restrictions attached to its formulary and/or prescription coverage.         Program  (Covered Lives)   Reason for Inclusion     Federal   HCFA(now known as CMS)    Essential     Indian Health Service, Navajo Region (201,583)   Covers a special needs population   Pharmacist involvement is progressive   Navajo nation is large     Department of Defense (8 million)   Offers variety of managed care products   National formulary as well as individual military treatment facility formularies     Veteran's Administration  (10-11 million)   National formulary as well as individual formularies     State   California  (4.9 million)   Largest state program   Reputation for restrictive formularies   Combination of FFS and MC for behavioral health     Texas  (2.5 million)   Moving Houston and Dallas behavioral health into MC   Has a reputation for poor coverage for behavioral health (BH)    State-approved treatment algorithms for mental illness (TMAP) have drawn attention for being progressive     Georgia  (1.2 million)   Mental health still in fee-for-service     Restrictions of number of prescriptions allowed per patient per month (5)   Legislature considering bill to mandate coverage for all FDA-approved drugs by all insurance providers     Wisconsin  (390,000)   Uses an integrated Medicaid MC program   Five BH carve-outs for special needs programs     Considered a leader in innovative, comprehensive programs          G. State Mental Health Systems    The following criteria were used to identify four public sector mental health systems to be interviewed:      Complement the state Medicaid programs that were selected to be interviewed;  Represent geographic diversity (Southwest, Mid-Atlantic, New England, and Midwest); and   Operate a system either closely tied to or completely separate from its state Medicaid program.       As a result, Arizona, Maryland, Massachusetts, and Ohio were selected to be interviewed.  More specifically, Arizona, Ohio, and Maryland operate separate public sector mental health systems from their state Medicaid programs.  However, Arizona uses the same infrastructure as its Medicaid program and Maryland consistently collaborates with its Medicaid program.  Massachusetts integrates its Medicaid and state mental health systems under a managed care framework.       State  (Covered Lives, Reported by Respondent)   Reason for Inclusion     Ohio  (250,000)   Marked separation between Medicaid and state mental health system     Massachusetts (24,500)   Integrated Medicaid and State Mental Health System:  all managed care     Arizona  (102,000)   Marked separation between Medicaid and state mental health system in theory, but they use the same infrastructure     Maryland (Not Reported)    Separate state mental health system and Medicaid (managed care, but FFS), that cooperate extensively.     Disparity between behavioral health carve-out and physical health Medicaid managed care pharmacy coverage        H. Corrections System   The corrections system was selected as an interview type because of the documented mental illness of the population it serves.  More specifically, New York's correctional system was identified through expert recommendations as an appropriate interview target because it is well-known for instituting a progressive and innovative prison system statewide.    I. Professional Associations   Two professional associations, the American Psychiatric Association (APA), which represents psychiatrists, and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), which represents family physicians, were identified to participate in this study.  Since psychiatrists primarily prescribe antipsychotics and antidepressants and primary care physicians (often family practice physicians) can prescribe antidepressants and/or make referrals to a psychiatrist for such a prescription, these two professional associations were selected as the most appropriate to present the desired perspectives of physician prescribing practices around the use of newer atypical antipsychotics and antidepressants.       Association   Reason for Inclusion     American Psychiatric Association   Leading association for prescribing providers (psychiatrists)     American Academy of Family Physicians   Provides relevant policy statements          J. Consumer Advocay Associations    Two consumer associations, the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI) and the National Mental Health Association (NMHA), were selected because of their national presence in the mental health field.  Additionally, NAMI specializes in advocating for consumers who suffer from schizophrenia and their families.  These two organizations' perspectives were essential in understanding the consumers' point-of-view and gaining a more balanced picture of the access and utilization issues associated with newer atypical antidepressants and antipsychotics.       Association   Reason for Inclusion     National Alliance for the Mentally Ill   Leading consumer advocacy organization     Special interest in schizophrenia     National Mental Health Association   Leading consumer advocacy organization             Appendix C.

The Board is composed of six podiatric physicians and       three consumer members. Each of the Board Members are appointed to the       Board by the Governor of Texas, for a term of six-years         History         Official recognition of podiatry as       a profession occurred with the enactment of the first state regulation by       New York in 1895. Nationally, there were only a few colleges teaching       podiatric medicine, with none in Texas. In 1917, those who had set up       practice in Texas had their earliest recorded meeting. They called the       group the  Texas Chiropodist Society . In 1919, the Texas legislature       first considered laws to regulate the practice. This bill was defeated in       1919, and again in 1921. Two years later, in 1923, legislation adding       podiatric medicine to the Texas Medical Act was passed as HB 487 of the 38 th        Legislature. Texas began licensing podiatric physicians in 1923, with the       creation of a regulatory board under the jurisdiction of the State Board       of Medical Examiners. Legislation passed in 1939, established an       independent board comprised of licensed podiatric physicians who would, in       turn, license other podiatric physicians and regulate podiatric medicine       in Texas. The new board was named the Texas State Board of Chiropody       Examiners. Governor W. Lee (Pappy) O’Daniel appointed the first Board       Members.         In 1967, the name was changed to the       Texas State Board of Podiatry Examiners, and in 1996, underwent an       additional name change to its present form; the Texas State Board of       Podiatric Medical Examiners.         Operations of the Board, are       supported entirely by yearly fees collected by the Board from each       licensee.         Board Members         Bradford W.

Health    and Homelessness                  Poor    health and lack of access to health care are among the causes of homelessness.       For people struggling to pay for    housing and other needs of daily living, the onset of a serious illness or    disability can easily result in homelessness following the depletion of    financial resources.                  Homelessness    is a health hazard.    The    experience of homelessness causes poor health, exacerbates existing illness,    and seriously complicates treatment.    Conditions such as frostbite, leg ulcers, and respiratory    infections are a direct result of living on the street.       Homelessness precludes good nutrition, good personal hygiene, and basic    first aid.    People without a    regular place to stay are also at great risk of emotional trauma due to    familial estrangement, multiple losses, and the chaos of an itinerant    lifestyle.    Children and youth are    particularly affected by the chaos of homelessness with greater risk of    childhood depression, malnutrition, immunization delay, repeated infections,    developmental delay, and discontinuity of school/learning experiences.       People without a regular place to stay are also at greater risk of    physical and emotional trauma resulting from muggings, beatings, and rape.       Conditions that require regular, uninterrupted treatment, such as    tuberculosis, HIV, diabetes, hypertension, addiction, mental illness, and    pregnancy are extremely difficult to treat or manage in the absence of a    stable residence.                  The    consequences of restricted access to comprehensive health care are reflected    in extremely high rates of both chronic and acute health problems among people    experiencing homelessness.       The Institute of Medicine has determined that those without a regular    place to stay are far more likely to suffer from most categories of chronic    health problems in comparison to the general population. [1]       Research also demonstrates that the cost of acute care for people    experiencing homelessness is significantly higher than for the general    population. [2]                  Access    to appropriate treatment and care is hindered dramatically by a lack of a    national health care system.     National    data gathered by the HCH program [3]     reveals that 73 percent of HCH patients have no source of health insurance.        Inaccessible public transportation, inflexible clinic hours, fees and    payments, and residency and documentation requirements may also present    barriers to health care.           Health    Care for the Homeless Program                  Origins    and Current Status                  The    first federal response to the crisis of homelessness was the passage of the    Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act of 1987.       Recognizing    that homelessness restricts access to mainstream health care services,    Congress established through the McKinney Act a health services program    specifically designed to circumvent these barriersHealth Care for the    Homeless (HCH) .    The    federal program extended the success of an earlier Robert Wood Johnson/Pew    Charitable Trusts program, which demonstrated that health care services    specifically targeted to people experiencing homelessness could dramatically    improve access to care for this vulnerable population.                  Congress    last reauthorized the HCH program in 1996 via the Health Centers Consolidation    Act.       That law consolidated community health centers, migrant health centers,    public housing primary care centers, and HCH projects under a single,    five-year authorization, but retained each of the four programs as a distinct    activity.    Authorization of the    consolidated health centers account expires in September 2001.                  Program    Summary                  The    HCH program (Section 330(h) of the Public Health Service Act [PHSA]) makes    grants to community-based organizations (referred to as ""projects""    or ""grantees"") in order to assist them in planning and delivering    high-quality, accessible health care to people experiencing homelessness.       HCH    projects assure access to primary care and related services through integrated    systems of care.    Projects    provide primary health, mental health, addiction, and social services with    intensive outreach and case management to link clients with appropriate    services.                  Formal    evaluations of the HCH program, including a 1995 evaluation conducted for the    Department of Health and Human Services, indicate that the projects are    meeting the health care and support service needs of people experiencing    homelessnessat levels that are unprecedented in the mainstream indigent    health care and public health insurance systems.                  Eligible    Population                  Projects    are required to use their HCH funds to serve people experiencing homelessness ,    who are defined in the PHSA as an individual who lacks housing (without    regard to whether the individual is a member of a family), including an    individual whose primary residence during the night is a supervised public or    private facility that provides temporary living accommodations and an    individual who is a resident in transitional housing.                  In    1999, HCH projects served nearly 500,000 patients.       59 percent of patients were male; 41 percent female.       60 percent were people of color.    15    percent were children and youth under age 19.                  Eligible    Projects                  HCH    projects are initiated, designed, and managed at the community level.       Any local public or private, nonprofit entity is eligible to apply for    HCH funds, including freestanding nonprofit community-based and faith-based    organizations, community health centers, hospitals, local health departments,    shelters, and homeless coalitions.                  The    HCH program currently funds 137 grantees in all states, the District of    Columbia, and Puerto Rico.    50    percent of projects are sponsored by community health centers.       Public health departments sponsor 19 percent.       25 percent are sponsored by private, nonprofit organizations, and the    remaining six percent are sponsored by hospitals.                  Required    Services                  HCH    projects, like other health centers, are required to provide the following    health and enabling services:                      basic        health services related to family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics,        obstetrics, and gynecology;                 diagnostic        laboratory and radiologic services;                 preventive        health services, including prenatal and perinatal screening; screening for        breast and cervical cancer; well child services; immunizations against        vaccine-preventable diseases; screenings for elevated blood lead levels,        communicable diseases, and cholesterol; pediatric eye, ear, and dental        screenings to determine the need for vision and hearing correction and        dental care; voluntary family planning services; and preventive dental        services;                 emergency        medical services;                 pharmaceutical        services;                 referrals        to providers of medical services and other health-related services;                 patient        case management services (including counseling, referral and follow-up)        and other services designed to assist health center patients in        establishing eligibility for and gaining access to Federal, State, and        local programs that provide or financially support the provision of        medical, social, educational, or other related services;                 services        that enable individuals to use the services of the health center        (including outreach, transportation, and translation);                 education        of patients and the general population served by the health center        regarding the availability and proper use of health services; and,                 addiction        services. [4]                               In    addition, most HCH projects surpass this scope of services .       For example, many HCH projects offer mental health services to their    patients.    Others have secured    resources from other federal programs, state and local government, and the    nonprofit and private sectors to develop housing for their patients.                  Service    Delivery Locations                  HCH    service delivery sites vary by project, but include fixed-site health clinics,    services provided at homeless shelters and soup kitchens, mobile medical    units, and street outreach teams.       Services are provided either directly, by contract with other    organizations, or by referral to another organization.                  Award    Process                  HCH    funds, like funds for other health center programs, are distributed via a    competitive award process.    Applications    for HCH funds are reviewed by an independent expert panel consisting of HRSA    staff and outside experts.    The    applicant must:                      describe        the target population;                 demonstrate        the target population's health services need;                 outline        a plan to provide the health services required by the Consolidated Health        Centers law; and,                 agree        to a number of requirements that are a condition for receiving funds.                               Those    conditions include:                      establishing        a governance body that includes significant participation from consumers        of the health services offered by the project, including people who are        experiencing or who have experienced homelessness;                 making        the statutorily-required primary health services available and accessible        promptly, as appropriate, and in a manner which assures continuity;                 establishing        and maintaining relationships with other health care providers;                 developing        an ongoing relationship with at least one hospital;                 having        an arrangement with the State Medicaid agency to be reimbursed for health        services provided to Medicaid beneficiaries;                 making        every reasonable effort to collect appropriate reimbursement for health        services provided to people entitled to public or private health        insurance;                 establishing        a schedule of fees or payments for the provision of services and a        schedule of discounts based on a participant's ability to pay;                 having        an ongoing quality improvement system; and                 developing        a plan, budget, and data collection system.                               Appropriations                  In    FY 2001, Congress appropriated $1.169 billion for the consolidated health    center account, which amounted to $100 million for the HCH program. [5]                  Challenges    Facing HCH Projects                  The    fundamental challenge facing HCH projectsas well as all health centers and    other health care safety net providersis one of insufficient resources to    sustain and expand services to people with limited or no means to pay for    health care.                  The    failure to appropriately invest in the nation's health care safety net    prevents HCH projects from fully responding to the following dynamics among    and needs of people without stable housing.                  Increasing    Homelessness As an    increasing number of people have incomes that fall below federal poverty    guidelines and find themselves living with friends, relatives, in shelters and    the streets, more people are seeking services from HCH projects.       Among the new patients of HCH services are families with children    exiting the welfare system, people with disabling addictions who have been    denied access to Medicaid and Supplemental Security Income, working poor    individuals whose earnings are insufficient to afford housing or health    insurance, emancipated and unaccompanied youth, and veterans unable to obtain    Department of Veterans Affairs health services.    HCH projects do not receive sufficient    funds to adequately serve their current caseloads, much less address the    increased demand for services from these emerging homeless subpopulations.                  Financial    Distress of HCH Projects  Many    HCH projects report decreasing revenues, especially from Medicaid.       The enrollment of Medicaid beneficiaries in managed care organizations    has resulted in a dramatic decrease not in the number of Medicaid    beneficiaries served by HCH providers, but in the reimbursements received from    Medicaid.    Consequently, HCH    projects have been forced to use federal grant and other funds now designated    for services to uninsured patients to balance the cost of care for Medicaid    patients, thereby reducing or eliminating services for patients who lack    health insurance.    HCH    projects do not receive sufficient funds to adequately serve both their    Medicaid and uninsured patients.        Untreated    Addiction and Mental Illness HCH    projects are required by statute to provide access to addiction services.       Many also provide mental health services.       Regrettably,    inadequate funding levels have prevented many projects from providing such    services at more than an elemental level,  even though projects    report that that addictions and mental illnesses are among the most prevalent    diagnoses of their patients.    Mainstream addiction and mental health services programs are    also underfunded and oversubscribed, and are also not designed appropriately    for people in homeless situations, further restraining willing homeless    patients from accessing treatment for these chronic conditions.       HCH    projects do not receive sufficient funds to adequately meet their patients    comprehensive health services needs.               Lack    of Supervised Medical Care for People in Recuperation In      the absence of a safe place in which to recuperate from    illness, medical interventions often prove ineffective for people experiencing    homelessness.    The unavailability    of appropriate accommodations for those requiring supervised medical care, but    not ill enough to remain hospitalized, makes it difficult for individuals to    recover from illness and resolve their homelessness.       Several HCH projects have pioneered responses to this service gap in    the form of medically-supervised recuperative care.       HCH projects do not receive sufficient    funds to develop or expand recuperative care arrangements for patients in    desperate need of such services.    In most communities, there is no other source of funding to    pay for recuperative care services to people experiencing homelessness.      Reauthorize    and Strengthen Health Care for the Homeless Program                  The    HCH program, the statutory authority of which expires September 30, 2001, is    still needed to ensure access to health services for people experiencing    homelessness.    We    urge Congress and the Administration to reauthorize HCH for a five-year period    as a distinct program within the Consolidated Health Centers account.                  In    addition, we urge Congress and the Administration to amend the HCH statute as    follows:                                  Establish        an authorization level of at least $172 million in FY 2002 as part of a $2        billion FY 2002 authorization level for the Consolidated Health Centers        account.                                   Maintain        current distribution of Consolidated Health Centers appropriations among        component programs within the account.                                   Restore        ability of HCH grantees to temporarily continue to provide services to        their formerly homeless patients.                                   Expand        range of addiction services that HCH grantees may provide to include harm        reduction, outpatient treatment, complementary modalities, and        rehabilitation, in addition to detoxification and residential treatment.                                   Explicitly        identify homeless youth as an eligible target subpopulation for innovative        homeless children outreach and comprehensive primary health services        grants.                             Reauthorize    and Strengthen Community Health Center Program                  Mainstream    indigent health care programs have historically underserved the homeless    population.    Congress recognized    this reality and established the HCH program.       Due to funding limitations, however, the HCH program is able to serve    only about 1/7 of the population estimated to experience homelessness each    year.    Consequently,    a majority of people experiencing homelessness relies on mainstream indigent    health care providers, including community health centers, for their health    care.                  Just    as they do in other mainstream indigent health care systems, people    experiencing homelessness face multiple challenges in accessing and utilizing    community health centers.       For example, the General Accounting Office, in a 2000 report ( Homelessness:    Barriers to    Using Mainstream Programs , GAO/RCED-00-184), found that community    health centers:    1) may not be    organized to make some of the special accommodations homeless people may    require, such as walk-in appointments; 2) may not thoroughly address other    needs that are inextricably linked to a patients health care needs, such as    housing, food, clothing, and other services; 3) do not tend to outstation    health services at locations and settings where homeless people congregate.       Denials of or delays in service based on inability to pay have also    been reported.                  To    redress the barriers that people experiencing homelessness are facing in    accessing and using community health center services, we urge Congress and the    Administration to amend the health centers statute as follows:                                  Require        community health centers to develop outreach and services plans for the        homeless population  to   ensure        that community health centers factor the complex medical and social needs        of people experiencing homelessness into their service system design and        implementation in anticipation of the inevitability that people without        housing will be seeking care from them.                 Ensure        access to health center services regardless of ability to pay  by          codifying in statute the long-standing principle that health center        services are to be available to patients regardless of their ability to        pay and by restoring provisions of prior law that assured that extremely        poor people would not have fees or payments imposed on them.                 Ensure        that health centers provide assistance in obtaining housing  in parity        with current law requirements that they assist their patients in obtaining        other public benefits (e.g., Medicaid, Food Stamps).                 Add        addiction and mental health services as optional additional services  to        encourage all health centers to expand their scope of services to include        treatment for these chronic conditions to the extent practicable.                 Add        recuperative care as an optional additional service  to encourage all        health centers to expand their scope of services to include this service        to the extent practicable.                               Reauthorize    and Strengthen National Health Service Corps Program                  The    National Health Service Corps (NHSC) program, the statutory authority of which    has expired, is still needed to ensure that Health Care for the Homeless    projects and other safety net providers are able to recruit and retain the    health services professionals necessary to operate their programs.       We    urge Congress and the Administration to reauthorize the NHSC for a five-year    period.                  In    addition, we urge Congress and the Administration to amend the NHSC statute as    follows:                                  Establish        an authorization level of at least $232 million in FY 2002 for NHSC.                                   Automatically        designate all federally-qualified health centers ,        including Health Care for the Homeless projects,  as        Health Professional Shortage Area facilities         for placement of Corps personnel.                                   Ensure        access to health services provided by NHSC professionals regardless of the        patients ability to pay  by   codifying        in statute that services provided by entities with NHSC placements and        NHSC private practice option placements are to be available to patients        regardless of their ability to pay and by waiving or reducing charges for        people who are unable to pay.           Recommendations    on Community Access Program                  Health    Care for the Homeless projects share the common belief among health care    safety net providers and public officials that patients derive improved health    and other benefits and that the health care safety net system operates more    efficiently when collaboration occurs among disparate providers serving the    same people.    As the principal health care safety net    providers to people with the most complex and interrelated medical and social    conditions possible, HCH projects have  had to     foster collaboration among health, housing, and support service providers in    their communities.    For HCH    projects, collaboration and linkages are intuitive processes.                  The    National Council has neither supports nor opposes authorization of the    Community Access Program or equivalent initiatives.       Our members views on this topic differ.       Some HCH projects believe that  new    federal safety net health care resources should be directed to the support of    services rather than to interactive functions.       Other HCH projects have reported positive collaborative experiences    that are occurring in their communities as a result of CAP projects.                    Should    Congress choose to authorize CAP or an equivalent health care safety net    collaboration program, we recommend that the following principles guide the    program's development.                                       The        program should facilitate improved and expanded access to a full range of        health and support services for all people without health insurance, with        a focus on those hardest to ensure or hardest to serve.                 Funds        should be directed to health and support service access improvement and        expansion rather than to the establishment of planning and collaboration        infrastructure.                 Applicants        should be permitted to propose population-focused projects (e.g.,        improving access to targeted, disproportionately affected and historically        underserved groups, such as homeless, migrant, or youth) as well as        geography-based projects (e.g., improving access to all people in a given        service area).                 Funds        should be permitted for both individual level and system level service        interventions.    Examples of        individual level interventions include outreach and engagement, public        health insurance assistance and advocacy, patient case management, and        direct payment for services.    Examples        of system level interventions include system integration, care        coordination, and patient record exchange.                 Grantees        should be the community-based primary health provider or network of        providers that is most closely connected to the intended beneficiaries.           Primary health providers are the most appropriate, and most common,        gateways to other health and support services.           They are also key players in treating patients and addressing their        basic health needs before they present at emergency and specialty care        providers.                 As        a condition for receiving funds, grantees should be expected to        demonstrate collaboration with other health care safety net providers in        the community, such as community, migrant, homeless, and public housing        health centers, public and charitable hospitals, local public health        departments with service delivery components, free clinics, academic        health centers providing uncompensated care, addiction service providers,        mental health service providers, HIV/AIDS service providers, and family        planning clinics.                 The        scope of health systems, programs, and providers that should be involved        in community collaboration include primary, addiction, mental, HIV/AIDS,        maternal and child, oral, vision, emergency, and other secondary and        tertiary health services.                 Community        collaborations resulting from the initiative should include support        systems, programs, and providers (such as housing providers) that are        essential to the effective delivery of health services to intended        beneficiaries.                 Representatives        of intended beneficiaries should be involved at the community level in        need identification, project design, and implementation monitoring.                                         Statement  for the Record                                       [1]       Institute of Medicine.    ""Homelessness,      Health and Human Needs.""    1988.

Pharmacy refers to the preparation and dispensing of drugs as well as the counseling of patients in the proper use of these drugs.    How does my pharmacist ensure the safety and accuracy of my prescription?    New York pharmacists must store medications under controlled environments. This includes protection from heat, light, and tampering.    Pharmacists use systems to ensure that....      each prescription is filled accurately and safely    the dispensed drugs do not interact poorly with other drugs, foods, or dietary supplements    each individual is screened for known allergies to medications      What preparation is required before someone can be licensed as a New York pharmacist?    To become a New York pharmacist, an applicant must have a minimum of a five-year Bachelor of Science degree in pharmacy, including courses in anatomy, biology, chemistry, physiology, and pharmacology. Beginning June 2004, all pharmacy students will be required to complete a six-year Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) program to be licensed in New York State. Applicants for the license must also complete an internship and pass written and practical licensing examinations.    To keep current in their profession, all practicing New York State licensed pharmacists are required to complete continuing education regularly, including a course on strategies and techniques to reduce medication and prescription errors.    Do pharmacies need to be registered in New York State to provide services to customers in New York?    Yes,  all pharmacies serving customers in New York --including those located in New York State and those that dispense through mail order, the Internet, or other delivery service-- must register with the New York State Education Department . You can use our Web site to  verify that a pharmacy is registered  or contact us at 518-474-3817.    To avoid harmful drug reactions or interactions, what should I be sure to tell my health care provider and pharmacist?      the names of all prescription and nonprescription (""over the counter"") medicines you take, including the conditions for which you take them-- remember , many ""over the counter"" medications were prescription drugs at one time, and many contain the same active ingredients as prescription drugs    if you are allergic to any medications    if you have any problems with any medicines    if you are, or could be, pregnant    if you are a smoker      Always  let your health care provider or pharmacist know if you have an unexpected reaction to a medication, and  always  take your medications as prescribed. Obtain all of your prescriptions at the same pharmacy, or keep careful records of medications you are taking.    When can I expect to receive counseling from a pharmacist or pharmacy intern?    Pharmacists or pharmacy interns  must  provide counseling:      before dispensing a medication for the first time to a new patient    before dispensing a new medication to an existing patient    if the dose, strength, route of administration, or directions for use have changed for an existing prescription previously dispensed to an existing patient      Registered pharmacies that deliver prescription drugs through the mail or by common carrier, including Internet pharmacies, must notify you in writing that counseling is available and provide a toll-free number where the pharmacist or pharmacy intern can be readily reached. A pharmacist or pharmacy intern must be available to provide counseling.    If the pharmacist or pharmacy intern determines that there are potential drug therapy problems that could endanger your health, he or she should contact you before filling your prescription or contact your prescriber for permission to dispense an alternative drug. If your prescriber approves an alternative drug, the pharmacist must include a notice of the change with your order and make two attempts to contact you by telephone to inform you of the change within 48 hours of mailing or delivery.    If you are having a prescription re-filled or you are having a prescription filled for a drug or medication you have been treated with previously, pharmacy staff must  offer  to provide counseling in keeping with the processes described above.    What information should I expect to receive when I am counseled by a pharmacist or pharmacy intern?    When your pharmacist counsels you about your prescription, the pharmacist may discuss the following information:      the medicine's name    what it is supposed to do    when the medicine should be taken and for how long    how the medicine should be taken    common side effects    foods, drinks, other medicines, or activities you should avoid while taking the medicine    what you should do if you miss a dose    how you should store the medicine    if there are any refills of the prescription      If you have trouble remembering or understanding the directions for a medication's use, call your pharmacist for the information you need. You have the right to decline counseling. If you decline counseling, your decision to decline will be documented in the pharmacy's records.    If I have a prescription that has authorized refills remaining, can I refill it at a pharmacy other than the one at which the prescription was first filled?    Yes, pharmacists may transfer refills from one pharmacy to another. This service will be provided only when a patient asks a pharmacist to send the prescription to another pharmacy.    May a prescription be sent electronically from the prescriber's office directly to a pharmacist?    Yes, if the prescriber and pharmacist have a secure system for electronic transmission--from computer to computer, or by fax--that assures accuracy and prevents unauthorized access to confidential information. You have the right to ask your prescriber for a written prescription and the right to choose your pharmacy, whether you deliver the prescription personally or it is sent verbally or electronically.    Where can I find the prices of frequently prescribed drugs?    All registered pharmacies in New York State  must make drug price lists available  with prices of the 150 most frequently prescribed drugs. The list should be updated weekly. You may request a computer-generated list in person or call the toll-free number provided on a pharmacy's Web site or mail order material.    What questions should individuals with disabilities ask about accessing services?    Ask such questions as whether the service location is physically accessible (curb cuts, ramps, restrooms, etc.) as well as whether there is a Telecommunication Device for the Deaf (TDD) and parking for people with disabilities. You may also ask if a delivery service is available.    Verifying a New York license:    New York pharmacists must display a current New York registration certificate; this certificate lists the professional's name, address, and dates of the registration period. Pharmacists must reregister every three years to practice in New York. Some professionals also display their original New York license, diploma, licenses from other states, and membership certificates.

GX024-84-11541715	HOME     ,  NHTSA Home Page       STATE REPORTING PRACTICES           Overview    To understand the legal and practical context in which family and friends intervene with older problem drivers, a study was undertaken of state laws and regulations for reporting high–risk drivers to state authorities and how these requirements are actually implemented. Research on reporting of problem drivers has been limited. Most states lack age–based policies for handling unsafe drivers and according to Anapolle (1992) apply their “impaired populations policies” to screen and process older drivers. In some states (including California) provisions specifically prohibit special tests from being administered based on the driver's age alone.     A 1992 study of driver licensing programs in 7 states (Petrucelli & Malinowski, 1992) found that reports by physicians are considered confidential in 34 states; and in 27 states, laws provide immunity to physicians for reporting. Hawley and Tannenhill's 1989 summary of driver licensing programs, identified other sources that assist in the detection of problem drivers, including law enforcement, courts, insurance companies, and family members, but suggest that their reports are largely spontaneous and typically do not result from a systematic and structured reporting process.     A state driver safety advisory committee was appointed by the Governor of Illinois in 1992. The committee studied state reporting regulations to help assess the merits of implementing a state law allowing family reporting of unsafe drivers.     Twenty–eight states automatically keep the reporter's identity confidential; an additional 2 states (Wisconsin and Alaska) do so only if requested by the reporter; and one state (Ohio) maintains confidentiality only for reports submitted by law enforcement. However, in most states, the reporter's identity is released if required by court order.     Three states provided statistics on reporting frequencies by source. Family members account for 5% (Iowa) to 10% (Michigan) of requests submitted for reexamination in these states. Law enforcement officials are by far the most common reporting source, reporting 70% (Wisconsin) to 91% (Iowa). Over 80% of referrals in Florida are submitted by driver licensing personnel; less than 10% originate from medical providers. In Oregon, 4% of referrals come from the licensing administration and medical specialists account for 37% of referrals and are the primary reporting source.     Physicians represent a significant reporting source in Pennsylvania, which requires that physicians report to the transportation department all patients over age 15 diagnosed as having any condition that could impair driving ability. Before 1990, the department received about 10,000 medical reports annually. About half of the reports submitted are for patients over age 45. Seizure disorders and other neurological disorders account for 67% of the license recalls. About 9% of physician reports result in driving restrictions, generally for vehicle modifications.     McKnight and Urquijo (1993) analyzed reporting by law enforcement officials in five states (California, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan and Oregon). Triggers differed by age of driver with sensory deficiencies increasing and medical conditions decreasing as a basis for referral among drivers in the advanced ages.         Method      A 33–item questionnaire was developed to evaluate reporting regulations and procedures, provisions for confidentiality and immunity, reporting frequencies by source, medical and functional conditions triggering reports, background characteristics of reported drivers, and follow–up activities including licensing outcomes and relicensing procedures.     The questionnaire was mailed to nine state driver license agencies and one provincial driver license agency: California, Connecticut, Florida, Massachusetts, Michigan, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, Wisconsin and Ontario, Canada. States selected for participation were considered to have licensing departments that would cooperate with the study, model driver safety programs and/or data relevant to this project.         Summary    of State Reporting Requirements and Practices     Health Care Provider Reporting Laws and Regulations      Seven states and one Canadian province returned questionnaires on their reporting regulations and practices: California, Connecticut, Florida, Michigan, Oregon, Texas, Wisconsin, and Ontario, Canada.     Of the states and province that responded, three—California, Oregon and Ontario—have laws mandating physicians to report potentially unsafe drivers. The remaining 5 states have laws permitting reporting by health professions, including physicians, psychologists, occupational and physical therapists, chiropractors and nurses.     Since 1939, California law has required physicians and surgeons to report patients aged 14 and above with disorders characterized by loss or lapse of consciousness that may recur. In 1988, the law was amended to specifically include Alzheimer's Disease and related dementia among conditions that physicians are required to report (California is the only state in the U.S. that requires referrals for Alzheimer's and related disorders).     In states with laws that permit reporting, referrals are accepted for all conditions that may adversely impact driving. Seven of the responding states require health providers to submit reports directly to the licensing department. In Ontario, reports are submitted to the ministry of transportation, medical review section/registrar of motor vehicles.     In Ontario, health providers who report potentially unsafe drivers are immune from both civil and criminal lawsuits. In Oregon, health care providers who report have no immunity from civil and criminal lawsuits. Of 5 states with reporting laws, 2 (Florida and Texas) provide health providers who report with immunity from civil and criminal lawsuits; one state (Wisconsin) provides immunity from a civil lawsuit; and one (Connecticut) provides no immunity.     Two jurisdictions require reports from sources other than health providers. In Ontario, reports are required from law enforcement; in Texas, law enforcement, court officials and DMV staff are required to report. Opportunities arise for law enforcement to identify problem drivers during normal traffic surveillance and during collision investigations. Results of license screenings can also alert DMV staff to possible medical or functional problems. Other potential reporting sources include family and friends, insurance companies, and drivers themselves.     Most states have special forms for reporting problem drivers. Oregon, Wisconsin, and Ontario presented the most comprehensive profiles. Data for Oregon for the year 1993 suggest that close to 5,300 reports are submitted annually. About 60% of the reports refer to drivers aged 56 and above; about 55% are drivers aged 65 and above; an estimated 35% are over 75 years; and about 5% are 87 years plus.     Approximately 36% of reports submitted in Oregon are self–referrals (largely from accident reports); among older drivers, self–reports drop to 29%. Health providers also represent an important source of referrals, accounting for 37% of all reports and 31% of reports of drivers aged 56 and over.     While the proportion of self–reports and reports by health providers drops among older drivers, law enforcement staff are a more significant reporting source, accounting for 17% of all reports as compared to 24% of reports for older drivers. DMV staff also are important, representing 3% of all reports and 4% of reports of older drivers. Family and friends account for 6% of all reports and 10% of reports for older drivers. Close to 90% of reports submitted by law enforcement, DMV staff, and even family and friends are for older drivers.     In 1995, Wisconsin received about 2,400 referrals. About two–thirds (68%) of these reports were submitted by law enforcement. While Wisconsin does not mandate physician reporting, about 22% of its reports originate from this source. About 3% are submitted by DMV staff. Michigan receives about 5,000 referrals annually. Physicians and law enforcement are the two primary reporting sources, followed by family members.     What are the medical conditions that prompt reports to state authorities? In Oregon, reported drivers investigated by the licensing department are most likely to be referred for either a seizure disorder (19%) or stroke (15%) (Data are not separately available for medical conditions of older reported drivers). Data on medical conditions of reported drivers are also available for Ontario. In 1995, there were 25,990 reported drivers with medical conditions and impairments. The three top ranking conditions were epilepsy (24%); neurological disorders, including stroke, Alzheimer's disease and other dementia (19%); and cardiovascular conditions (15%). Age breakdowns of reported drivers are also available for Ontario, and show that close to 7% of the reported drivers are aged 65 or older.     A typical scenario is that when the report is received, the DMV checks the license status and driving record of the referred driver. The reexamination differs depending upon the person's medical or functional condition. A drive test may also be required. Three of the seven states participating in the survey (California, Connecticut, and Wisconsin) have special road tests they may administer. These tests are longer in length (45–60 minutes versus 15 minutes for the standard test) to help evaluate the driver's endurance, and use routes designed especially for the driver's condition. If the driver has dementia, the examiner tests the driver's ability to follow multiple instructions, concentrate, recall information, and perform divided attention tasks. Some states also rely on other testing procedures. In Oregon, California, and Connecticut, a personal interview may also be conducted with the driver. In more serious cases, a license revocation or suspension may occur which prohibits driving. License suspensions are temporary and are typically issued if the medical condition is expected to improve.     Licensing Actions     Limited data are available on licensing actions that result for reported drivers following their reexamination. In Florida and Oregon it is equally likely for drivers to require a license suspension as to receive no license action at all. In Florida, 11.7% of reported drivers had licenses suspended, and 11.9% had no change in licensure status. License restrictions rarely occur in Oregon (4 in 1994 and 5 in 1995). Data for Ontario, by contrast, indicate that most reported drivers (92%) experience no change in license status; about 7% of reported drivers have their license suspended.     Data on licensing actions are not available by driver age. However, California reports that when license restrictions occur for older drivers, they commonly involve the use of corrective lenses, followed by daylight driving only; geographic restrictions rarely occur.     Age–Based License Procedures    In California, license renewals are prohibited by mail after age 69. Beyond that age, drivers must pass vision and knowledge tests every four years. A road test may be required if the driver demonstrates confusion, tremors, or other symptoms that may seriously jeopardize driving.     In Oregon, drivers aged 50 and above must pass a vision screening every eight years. Respondents were sometimes uncertain about their state laws and regulations. Although limited, the data from the questionnaire corroborate other research findings (e.g., Illinois study, 1991) which suggest family and friends rarely report potentially unsafe drivers to state authorities. In Oregon, about 300 reports were submitted by family and friends (in 1993), accounting for about 6% of all referrals and 10% of referrals of older drivers. In Oregon, where physicians are mandated to report, health providers accounted for 37% of all referrals (and 31% of referrals of older drivers). The large share of these referrals are actually submitted by nurse practitioners and physician assistants; physicians account for up to 10% of referrals. In Oregon, about 8.5 of every 10,000 licensed drivers are reported by health providers to state authorities; in Wisconsin the rate of reporting by health providers is 1.6 per 10,000 licensed drivers. Considering health provider reporting of older drivers, the rate climbs to 16 of every 10,000 licensed drivers aged 56 and above in Oregon. (Corresponding data are unavailable for other states.)     In Oregon, about 23.1 of every 10,000 licensed drivers (and as many as 51 of    10,000 licensed drivers aged 56 plus) were reported (in 1993). The corresponding    rate for all drivers in Wisconsin is 6.6 (in 1995). Currently, states mandating    reporting by health care providers only include physicians under this requirement.    Other health care professionals are also well–positioned to detect and    intervene with problem drivers.    BACK     -  TABLE OF CONTENTS  -  FORWARD

potentially fatal outcomes, CONREP programs with clozapine patients shall comply with all policies and procedures specified in Section 1520. All requirements stipulated by the pharmaceutical companies and the Statewide Clozapine Patient Manager (listed in following pages) must be implemented. Clozapine is the generic name for a unique antipsychotic drug. Clozapine is dispensed under the brand name Clozaril by Novartis. Clozaril may also be dispensed as Clozapine unless the prescribing physician states brand name only. Clozapine is available in a generic form from Zenith Goldline Pharmaceuticals. Information utilizing either name refers to the same drug. Clozapine is particularly successful for some treatment-resistant schizophrenic patients who have been unresponsive to standard antipsychotic drug treatment. It has done so with a markedly reduced incidence of extrapyramidal reactions and has yet to be implicated in the production of tardive dyskinesia. Approximately 3% of patients receiving this drug will experience leukopenia and 1% will experience agranulocytosis, which is potentially life-threatening. Due to this potential risk of toxicity, Novartis has stipulated a number of conditions that govern the dispensing of this drug. These conditions will be described later in this section. There is a significant cost associated with the distribution of this drug which limit its use. In addition to the high cost of the drug itself, there are specific procedures for prescribing physicians, dispensing pharmacies and the patient to follow, including regular blood tests.  Background Description  Usage  Toxicity  Cost and Additional Procedures  CONREP POLICY AND PROCEDURE MANUAL July 2001  1520.1   RELATED MEDICAL ISSUES: 1520 CLOZAPINE TREATMENT INTRODUCTION Purposes of Policy The policy regarding the use of clozapine for CONREP patients has been developed to: * Provide programs with basic information regarding the availability and conditions associated with the distribution of this drug; * Detail the procedures and system established to enable the drug to be administered to CONREP patients for whom it is most likely to be beneficial in a manner which minimizes risk from potential side effects; * Establish the necessary coordination of treatment and discharge planning between state hospitals and CONREP programs in order to prevent interruptions in clozapine treatment for patients who are discharged from state hospitals while receiving the drug; and * Enable CONREP programs to provide this medication and its associated requirements in the most effective manner. Medi-Cal Coverage Clozapine is available through Fee-for-Service Medi-Cal. A Treatment Authorization Request (TAR) is no longer necessary. Medi-Cal will cover the costs of the medication and laboratory work. CONREP programs should encourage eligible patients to utilize this Medi-Cal benefit.  CONREP POLICY AND PROCEDURE MANUAL 1520.2 July 2001   RELATED MEDICAL ISSUES: 1520 CLOZAPINE TREATMENT CRITERIA FOR USE Current Patients If a patient the time of it can be criteria for is under going clozapine treatment at discharge from a state hospital, then assumed that he or she meets the administration of this drug.  New Patients  If a CONREP director determines that a patient already in community placement would be appropriate for clozapine treatment, the patient must meet the clinical indicators listed below which reflect the current State Hospital Clozapine Protocol (Special Order 105.03, 1/1/2000). The following clinical indicators must be present: * The patient must have an adequately documented diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder according to current DSM criteria; * Patients with other diagnosis may be eligible if they have tardive dyskinesia and require antipsychotic medications; * Patients with treatment resistant bipolar disorder may all qualify; * The patient must have at least one of the following conditions documented: 1. Tardive dyskinesia when antipsychotic medications are required; and/or 2. Treatment resistance for schizophrenic or schizoaffective patients, as defined below.  Clinical Indicators  Treatment Resistance  Treatment resistance for schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder is defined as treatment failures in two previous neuroleptics trial, each of which must be at least 6 weeks in duration, and which included at least one different atypical neuroleptic.  CONREP POLICY AND PROCEDURE MANUAL July 2001  1520.3   RELATED MEDICAL ISSUES: 1520 CLOZAPINE TREATMENT CRITERIA FOR USE Treatment Resistance (cont.) Patients unable to complete a full trial due to adverse reactions will qualify if the specific adverse reaction is documented and another neuroleptic of a different class less likely to cause that adverse reaction has been tried. For the treatment of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, an ""adequate dose"" of a typical/conventional antipsychotic drug needed to qualify for treatment failure is defined as a minimum of 600mg per day of chlorpromazine or its equivalent. The chlorpromazine equivalents of several typical antipsychotics are listed below. Chlorpromazine Equivalents Drug Chlorpromazine Thioridazine Mesoridazine Perphenazine Loxapine Molindone Thiothixene Trifluoperazine Fluphenazine Haloperidol Risperidone Olanzapine Quetiapine Contraindications Equivalence 600 600 300 60 60 60 30 30 12 12 6 20 400  There are numerous specific contraindications and cautions in prescribing this drug which are described in the insert provided by Novartis, the Physician Desk Reference (PDR) and/or other recent literature. Any physician prescribing this drug is responsible for becoming knowledgeable about this material.  CONREP POLICY AND PROCEDURE MANUAL 1520.4 July 2001   RELATED MEDICAL ISSUES: 1520 CLOZAPINE TREATMENT CONDITIONS FOR USE Novartis and Zenith Requirements Before either of the pharmaceutical companies (Novartis and Zenith) will authorize clozapine for individual patients, there are several conditions which must be met. These are described below and include both initial and ongoing responsibilities. Any physician intending to prescribe clozapine and the pharmacy which will dispense it, must provide the distributing pharmaceutical company with specific information via a ""compliance"" form agreeing to follow the required procedures. This process establishes them as a registered Clozapine Treatment System (CTS). All patients must be registered with either the Novartis or Zenith National Registry and approval received prior to beginning treatment. Approval will be in the form of ""Rechallenged Clearance Authorization Numbers"" that will be assigned to patients. Zenith will have 24 hour access to the Novartis Registry Master File, so that either company will be able to cross check patients' registry files. If there are any changes to the Clozapine Treatment System, (e.g. patient is returned to the state hospital, or a change in the prescribing M.D. or pharmacy), then re-registration with the National Registry is required.  Clozapine Treatment System (CTS)  Patient Registration  Changes in CTS  Blood Monitoring Weekly Initial and weekly blood tests to monitor white blood cell (WBC) counts, that include a differential, are required for the first six months. These laboratory results are to be reviewed by both the physician and pharmacist before the drug is dispensed.  CONREP POLICY AND PROCEDURE MANUAL July 2001  1520.5   RELATED MEDICAL ISSUES: 1520 CLOZAPINE TREATMENT CONDITIONS FOR USE Blood Monitoring Every Other Week (cont.) When there has been continuous clozapine therapy and no abnormal WBC counts for six months, a clinical decision may be made by the treating physician for every-other-week blood testing. Acceptable WBC counts consist of a WBC greater than or equal to 3,000/mm3 and an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1,5000/mm3. Physician knowledge of the patient for these 6 months is imperative. The information from the blood draws are to be provided to the Novartis National Registry each time a patient's blood is tested. Blood monitoring must also be performed for a minimum of four weeks after discontinuing the medication. In addition to the blood test indicated above, the following tests are recommended, to be ordered at the physician's discretion: * Full liver function panel every 6 months; and * A KUB (abdominal plate X-ray) quarterly. Drug Dispensing Prescriptions for Clozapine can only be filled at a pharmacy registered as part of a Clozapine Treatment System. Patients receive no more than a weekly supply of medication at each dispensing, if they are having weekly blood tests. Pharmacists may dispense a two week supply of clozapine if the physician has authorized the blood draws be performed on a biweekly basis. Pharmacists are allowed to provide one or two week supply of the drug only after verification of an appropriate WBC count in the patient's blood test. If there is no blood test result or an unacceptable WBC count, no drug is dispensed.  Upon Discontinuance of Drug  Other Tests  CONREP POLICY AND PROCEDURE MANUAL 1520.6 July 2001   RELATED MEDICAL ISSUES: 1520 CLOZAPINE TREATMENT COORDINATION OF STATE HOSPITAL DISCHARGE State Hospital Responsibilities Department Policies All of the state hospital responsibilities regarding clozapine described in this section have been issued as policies in Long Term Care Services, Special Orders No. 109, Procedures for Transitioning Patients Receiving Clozapine Treatment (4/3/95) and No. 105.03, Psychotropic Medication Guidelines and Clozapine Protocol (1/1/2000). State hospitals are to provide CONREP programs with the current listing of all CONREP patients who are receiving clozapine in the state hospitals. The transfer of this information shall occur on a quarterly basis, or sooner if indicated. CONREP programs will be notified whenever clozapine treatment has been initiated or discontinued for any specific patient. State hospital staff are responsible for coordinating discharge planning with CONREP liaison staff. CONREP will be notified and given opportunity to participate in the final 90 day treatment planning conference prior to discharge. The following information will be provided to CONREP programs for all patients receiving clozapine treatment: * Assistance in ascertaining the patient's MediCal eligibility status; * Each patient's progress and response to the medication (Form MH 5765 Clozapine Data Report); and * Anticipated date of discharge. Enrollment in another Clozapine Treatment System must be in place prior to discharge to the community.  Notification of Clozapine Treatment  Coordinated Discharge Planning  CONREP POLICY AND PROCEDURE MANUAL July 2001  1520.7   RELATED MEDICAL ISSUES: 1520 CLOZAPINE TREATMENT COORDINATION OF STATE HOSPITAL DISCHARGE State Hospital Responsibilities (cont.) Trust Office Notification State hospital staff will notify the Trust Office within 90 days prior to the patient's discharge in order to establish Medi-Cal eligibility at the time of discharge. On the day of discharge or earlier if possible, the state hospitals will transmit Patient Discharge Information to CONREP programs (Form MH 5765) via FAX or overnight mail. This information should contain the following: * Discharge date or anticipated discharge date; * Last WBC results and date drawn; * Current dose of clozapine; * Quantity and number of days supply of clozapine to be dispensed as take-home medication; * Name and dosage of at least two other antipsychotic medications that have been treatment failures, reasons for failure and the duration of drug trials; and * Other medications the patient is currently taking. Discharge Day Discharge will occur early in the week, soon after the last blood count has been drawn to expedite the transfer of these functions to the community by the following week.  Clozapine Discharge Information  CONREP POLICY AND PROCEDURE MANUAL 1520.8 July 2001   RELATED MEDICAL ISSUES: 1520 CLOZAPINE TREATMENT COORDINATION OF STATE HOSPITAL DISCHARGE CONREP Responsibilities Contact With Hospital Trust Office Upon notification that a patient has been started on clozapine, CONREP liaison staff need to establish contact with the Trust Office in the state hospital in order to assist in their patient's Medi-Cal eligibility determination process.  Referral to Clozapine Treatment System  In order to maintain continuity of drug services for state hospital patients currently receiving clozapine, the CONREP program should refer the patient to the appropriate local or statewide CONREP Clozapine Treatment System prior to or immediately at the point of discharge to the community (see following pages for details).  Release of Information  Because information must regularly be sent to Novartis, patient consent for the release of information must be obtained. This release of information consent is in addition to the usual informed consent regarding medication. Programs may use form MH 5671, Authorization for Release of Patient Information or a comparable local program form.  Terms & Conditions of Outpatient Treatment  Procedures and requirements for clozapine treatment services are to be incorporated into each patient's Terms and Conditions of Outpatient Treatment.  CONREP POLICY AND PROCEDURE MANUAL July 2001  1520.9   RELATED MEDICAL ISSUES: 1520 CLOZAPINE TREATMENT CONREP CLOZAPINE TREATMENT SYSTEMS (CTS) CTS Services The variety of services required in order to maintain a patient on clozapine have been termed a Clozapine Treatment System (CTS). A CTS should incorporate the following services: * Patient registration in the appropriate National Registry; * Arrangement and coordination of pharmacy and laboratory services; * Patient compliance monitoring; * Quality assurance monitoring; * Reports to the appropriate national registry and prescribing physician; * Notification to physician, pharmacy and case manager if any problems develop with compliance or lab results; and * Coordination of services during vacation and travel away from home area. Prescribing Physician Responsibilities  All clozapine prescriptions for CONREP patients must be prescribed by the CONREP staff (or county CTS) physician. The physician is also responsible for reviewing weekly lab results and coordinating with the pharmacy regarding weekly dispensing of the medication. The physician is also responsible for notifying the primary therapist and the appropriate CTS manager whenever there is any change in any of the patient's medications.  CONREP POLICY AND PROCEDURE MANUAL 1520.10 July 2001   RELATED MEDICAL ISSUES: 1520 CLOZAPINE TREATMENT CONREP CLOZAPINE TREATMENT SYSTEMS (CTS) CONREP Options Local CTS Where available, all CONREP programs (both county and private contractors) are encouraged to utilize the county mental health program for Medi-Cal enrollment, provision of medication, lab work and all other aspects of a CTS for both Medi-Cal and non-Medi-Cal patients. The State Department of Mental Health has established a statewide CTS for those CONREP programs which are unable to obtain these services through county mental health programs. The statewide CONREP CTS is available to provide all non-physician clozapine related services including the provision of medication and all other aspects of CTS for Medi-Cal and non-Medi-Cal patients. If a CONREP program is unable to utilize the CTS services available within its local mental health system, approval for using the statewide CTS must be received in advance from the program's DMH CONREP Operations liaison. Such a choice must be based on compelling reasons related to fiscal factors and/or program effectiveness.  Statewide CONREP CTS  DMH Approval  Statewide CONREP CTS Services Statewide CTS Manager The State has contracted with Peter B. Perrin, R.Ph., FASCP to be the statewide CONREP CTS manager.

The statewide CONREP CTS manager will coordinate all clozapine related services for referred patients. All prescription, pharmacy and lab information will be forwarded to the contractor. In addition to all CTS services listed earlier in this section, the statewide CONREP CTS manager will issue clozapine patient identification cards and provide clinical pharmacist consultation. Hospital Discharge Referral Process In order to begin coordinating discharge plans with the CTS Statewide Manager, a written referral utilizing DMH form MH 7007, Clozapine Referral Information Sheet should be initiated by CONREP within 30 days of an anticipated admission date for any clozapine patient requiring these services. At the same time, the discharging state hospital should also forward DMH form MH 5765, Clozapine Data Report. Both referral forms should be forwarded to the statewide CONREP CTS manager (see address on previous page). The written referral prior to hospital discharge should contain the following information: * * * * Patient name; State hospital or location of patient; Expected date of discharge to community; Location of planned residence and phone number, if known; and * Identification and phone number of primary therapist.  Initial Referral Information  CONREP POLICY AND PROCEDURE MANUAL 1520.12 July 2001   RELATED MEDICAL ISSUES: 1520 CLOZAPINE TREATMENT CONREP CLOZAPINE TREATMENT SYSTEMS (CTS) Statewide CONREP CTS Services Notification of Discharge or Transfer from CONREP (cont.)  CONREP programs are to notify the statewide CTS manager of the pending discharge from CONREP or transfer to another CONREP program of any patient receiving clozapine whom the manager has been monitoring. Within 30 days prior to the anticipated date of discharge, forward the following information to the statewide CTS manager via FAX: * Patient's name; * Expected date of discharge; * Name and phone number of CONREP contact person coordinating the discharge; * Name, contact person and phone number of new program, if clozapine treatment is to continue. Also, FAX the final date of discharge and any relevant discharge information. The CTS manager will coordinate the transition of clozapine monitoring functions to the new program.  Clozapine Services Plan  Each CONREP program must file a plan with the Forensic Services, CONREP Operations Office describing how clozapine services will be provided to its patients. The plan should include identification of: * Which CTS (local or statewide CONREP) will be utilized; * The CTS manager; * Who will perform the duties and functions identified under CTS Services (see page 1520.10); and * The jail contact person with the assigned responsibilities.  CONREP POLICY AND PROCEDURE MANUAL July 2001  1520.13   RELATED MEDICAL ISSUES: 1520 CLOZAPINE TREATMENT PROGRAM CONCERNS Patient Support The patient's primary therapist should incorporate the requirements for weekly lab work and pharmacy visits to the patient's individual treatment plan and help coordinate and support the patient's ability to make these weekly appointments. All CONREP staff should monitor the and response to the are to be reported to involved with the patient patient's behavior, progress medication. Any concerns the physician on staff.  Observation  Patient Compliance  All CONREP staff involved with the patient shall report any information concerning the patient's non-compliance with clozapine requirements (e.g. failure to take medication and/or failure to appear for laboratory work) to the primary therapist, who is then responsible for the contacting the CTS manager. In the event that a clozapine patient is traveling or on vacation, the CONREP program staff physician or primary therapist must notify their CTS manager. The CTS manager will then make arrangements with a registered Clozapine Treatment System in the travel destination and provide the patient with specific instructions on procedures to maintain necessary lab work and pharmacy services. A current list of all registered Clozapine Treatment Systems is available through the Novartis National Registry: 1-800-448-5938. The Statewide CTS Manager, Peter Perrin, R.Ph, FASCP of ICPS can assist programs with vacation, travel and relocation concerns related to clozapine. (Please see earlier pages.)  Vacation and Travel  CONREP POLICY AND PROCEDURE MANUAL 1520.14 July 2001   RELATED MEDICAL ISSUES: 1520 CLOZAPINE TREATMENT PROGRAM CONCERNS Notification of Status Change If a CONREP patient receiving clozapine has been rehospitalized, jailed or placed in any institution, it is the CONREP program's responsibility to promptly notify the CTS manager. For rehospitalizations, it is important to also indicate a timeline for the patient's return to the community.  Jailed Patients CTS Notice When a CONREP patient receiving clozapine has been jailed, the name of the appropriate contact within the jail system must also be identified for the CTS manager. The jail contact will be responsible for providing the CTS manager access to the patient and/or the administration of the medication. If the patient is under the management of the statewide CONREP CTS manager, the Community Program Director or designee shall notify the jail contact. This notification will identify the CONREP statewide clozapine patient manager and indicate his need to have access to the patient and all relevant information in order to assure that the patient continues to receive the medication and all lab work. Problems If any problems arise concerning access to the patient in jail, the provision of medication or clozapine related treatment services, the CTS manager will notify the Community Program Director. It is the responsibility of the Community Program Director or designee to attempt to resolve those problems in concert with jail authorities so that clozapine treatment can be maintained. CONREP is only responsible for providing this liaison function for patients already admitted to its program. CONREP is not responsible for those state hospital patients on court leave status.  Non-CONREP Patients  CONREP POLICY AND PROCEDURE MANUAL July 2001  1520.15   RELATED MEDICAL ISSUES: 1520 CLOZAPINE TREATMENT MEDI-CAL PROCEDURES Eligibility Determination of eligibility and enrollment in the Medi-Cal program must be made by the state hospital trust office prior to seeking authorization for Medi-Cal to fund clozapine and its related laboratory services. (See prior sub-section on Coordination of State Hospital Discharge.)  Medi-Cal Guidelines for Clozapine  Medi-Cal guidelines require the following: * Evidence of a diagnosis of severe schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder; * Demonstrated history of treatment failure on two conventional neuroleptics (antipsychotic drugs) in separate trials.

In diagnosing ailments, naturopathic physicians take medical histories, order laboratory tests, and perform physical examinations. Treatment methods include nutritional advice, the use of homeopathic remedies, herbs and botanical medicines, vitamin and mineral therapy, physiotherapy, hydrotherapy, and stress management. There are currently 34 naturopathic physicians in Colorado who have graduated from a naturopathic medical college accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the U. S. Department of Education. There are other persons practicing naturopathy in Colorado who call themselves N.D., naturopathic doctor, Doctor of Naturopathy, and N.M.D. (naturopathic medical doctor). Currently, the public has no reliable means of determining the education or training of someone who practices naturopathy. It is reasonable to believe that there is a vast difference in the knowledge and abilities of someone who has graduated from a fouryear college program in naturopathic medicine and someone who has taken a six-week correspondence course. Although the sunrise review conducted in 1993 recommended against regulation, a bill for full regulation and licensure of naturopathic physicians was introduced in the General Assembly, indicating that the Joint Sunrise/Sunset Committee found that regulation was necessary. While it is not clear whether the sunrise criteria for regulation have been satisfied, there are reasons to consider regulation of naturopathic physicians: it is possible that the public is confused by the common use of the various forms of the term ""naturopath""; it is possible that the practice of some naturopaths who refer to themselves as ""doctors"" is in violation of the Colorado Consumer Protection Act; and the use of naturopathic and alternative medicine is becoming increasingly mainstream, thus requiring some level of regulatory oversight. If the General Assembly determines that regulation of naturopathic physicians is warranted, two alternative regulatory models should be considered: title protection or a licensure program. Further discussion of the two models appear in the conclusion of this report.  1   Introduction Sunrise Process The Department of Regulatory Agencies has completed its evaluation of the application for regulation of naturopathic physicians submitted by the Colorado Association of Naturopathic Physicians. The applicants seek state regulation of naturopathic physicians. Pursuant to the Colorado Sunrise Act, 24-34-104.1, C.R.S., the applicant must prove the benefit to the public of the proposal for regulation according to the following criteria: 1) Whether the unregulated practice of the occupation or profession clearly harms or endangers the health, safety or welfare of the public, and whether the potential for harm is easily recognizable and not remote or dependent on tenuous argument; Whether the public needs, and can reasonably be expected to benefit from, an assurance of initial and continuing professional or occupational competence; and Whether the public can be adequately protected by other means in a more cost-effective manner.  2) 3)  Overview of Application for Regulation The Colorado Association of Naturopathic Physicians (CANP) submitted a sunrise application for licensure on behalf of its 34 members in Colorado. To be eligible for membership in the CANP, one must have a degree from a naturopathic medical curriculum accredited by the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME). This occupation is also known as naturopathic doctors, Doctors of Naturopathy, N.D., naturopaths, naturopathic practitioners, Doctors of Naturopathic Medicine, and Naturopathic Medical Doctors. For the purpose of this report, the term ""naturopathic physician"" refers to those persons with a degree from a CNME-accredited naturopathic medical college. The applicant argues that the state should license naturopathic physicians because naturopathic medicine is an autonomous profession and may be considered a form of the practice of medicine and needs to have independent regulation and the accompanying individual responsibility.  2   Introduction Methodology The scope of this review was comprehensive in nature. As part of this sunrise review process, the Department of Regulatory Agencies interviewed the applicant, naturopathic physicians in private practice and their patients. The Department performed a literature search, contacted pertinent professional associations, and reviewed other states' statutes regarding naturopathic licensure. Numerous articles in medical and health-related journals and magazines were reviewed, as well as other literature. Curriculum for both onsite and correspondence courses in naturopathy were obtained. The program administrator for the Colorado Board of Medical Examiners was interviewed and inquiries regarding complaints against naturopathic physicians were made of the Colorado Attorney General's Consumer Protection Office. Historical Perspective Naturopathic medicine grew out of the nature cure healing systems of the 18th and 19th centuries, but traces its philosophical roots to the Hippocratic school of medicine (circa 400 B.C.). Many of the therapies used in natural medicine have a long history of used in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Conventional medicine and naturopathy were at one time quite similar in their use of medicinal plants, diet therapies, and hydrotherapy treatments to help heal the sick. The naturopathic profession has a 100-year history in North America. Naturopathy evolved in the late nineteenth century through the work of Dr. Benjamin Lust, a German physician who came to the United States in 1892 to spread the practice of hydrotherapy, or the use of water cures to treat illness. The practice grew to include all natural methods of healing, including the use of botanical medicines, homeopathy, nutritional therapy, and manipulative therapies. In 1895, Dr. John Scheel of New York City coined the term ""naturopathy"" to describe a method of health care that includes an evolving system of natural therapies. Naturopathy and other forms of ""alternative"" treatment were more popular and more accepted throughout the U.S. in the early 1900's. There were numerous naturopathic colleges, doctors, and hospitals. Due to economic and political pressure, the practice of naturopathic medicine almost ceased. It was revitalized in the 1950's by a small naturopathic school in the Northwest and has seen a dramatic increase in popularity during the last ten years.  3   Introduction Who are Naturopathic Physicians? Naturopathic physicians are primary health care providers who exercise independent judgment in diagnosing and treating illnesses. They are trained to see patients for general health care, for preventive health care, for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic conditions, and for initial evaluations before referral to medical specialists. They also serve those whose treatment by conventional means has not met their needs and who seek naturopathic care as an alternative. Naturopathy is a system of health care based on the philosophy that the human body has the power to heal itself by restoring its natural balance. The current scope of naturopathic practice may include, but is not limited to: clinical nutrition, botanical medicine, homeopathic medicine, physical medicine, oriental medicine, naturopathic obstetrics, hydrotherapy, spinal manipulation, psychological medicine and minor surgery. Naturopathic practice excludes the use of most synthetic drugs and major surgery. The majority of naturopathic physicians are in private practice, either solo practice or in group practice with other professionals such as chiropractors, osteopaths, or other naturopathic physicians. Some naturopathic physicians may concentrate on particular fields such as pediatrics, allergies, or cardiology. The practice of naturopathy is based on the philosophy that can be summarized most simply as helping the body heal itself in the least invasive, most fundamentally curative manner possible. This approach is not tied to any particular therapy or modality, but rather is oriented to a rational blend of vitalistic and mechanistic principles working with the whole person, and educating the patient in the ways of health. There are six principles that naturopathic physicians consider to be fundamental in defining naturopathic medicine. They are: a. The Healing Power of Nature: Naturopathic medicine recognizes an inherent healing process in the person that is ordered and intelligent. The body is capable of healing itself. The role of the naturopathic physician is to identify and remove obstacles to healing and recovery and to facilitate and augment this inherent natural tendency of the body. Identify and Treat the Cause: Naturopathic physicians seek to identify and remove the underlying causes of illness, not merely eliminate or suppress symptoms.  b.  4   Introduction c. First Do No Harm: Naturopathic physicians follow three guidelines to avoid harming patients: 1. Utilize methods and medicinal substances which minimize risks of side effects, using the least force needed to diagnose and treat. 2. Avoid, when possible, the harmful suppression of symptoms. 3. Acknowledge and work with the individual's self-healing process. Doctor as Teacher: Naturopathic physicians recall that the origin of the word ""doctor"" is the Latin word, ""to teach."" A fundamental emphasis in naturopathic medicine is patient education. Treat the Whole Person: Naturopathic physicians attempt to take into consideration all the factors that make up patients' lives and affect their health and well being. Prevention: Naturopathic medicine emphasizes the prevention of disease, assesses risk factors, and makes appropriate interventions with patients to prevent illness.  d.  e.  f.  Scope of Practice Naturopathic physicians believe that health results from the harmonious functioning of all parts of a person. Therapy is directed at the whole person and at the underlying cause of illness, such as the patient's lifestyle, diet habits, and emotional state. Naturopaths take a holistic approach to healing. In diagnosing ailments, naturopathic physicians take medical histories, order laboratory tests, and perform physical examinations. Treatment methods include nutritional advice, the use of homeopathic remedies, herbs and botanical medicines, vitamin and mineral therapy, physiotherapy, hydrotherapy, psychological counseling, stress management, and spinal manipulation. In regard to spinal manipulation, naturopathic physicians differ from chiropractors in that chiropractors may specialize in one therapeutic approach while naturopathic practice usually includes a broad range of drugless therapies. One treatment method, homeopathy, based on the principle that ""like cures like,"" is a treatment in which the patient receives tiny dosages of natural substances that in larger dosages would cause the same symptoms as the ailment. It is based upon the observed relationship between a remedy's ability to produce signs and symptoms in a healthy individual and the same remedy's ability to cure a sick patient with similar signs and symptoms. Homeopathic remedies are derived from a wide variety of plant, mineral, and chemical substances. The 1938 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act gave legal status to homeopathic remedies. These remedies are recognized as drugs in the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States. Homeopathic remedies are available from practitioners, pharmacists, and health food stores, as well as manufacturers who sell directly to the public.  5   Introduction Hydrotherapy, another method of treatment used by naturopathic physicians, is defined as the use of water in any of its forms for the maintenance of health or the treatment of disease. Water at various temperatures is used for therapeutic purposes. For example, the physiotherapy departments of many hospitals have heated hydrotherapy pools for treatment. In addition, alternate treatments with hot and cold water are used to stimulate the circulation of the blood. Naturopathic physicians may also recommend hydrotherapy for its revitalizing properties during convalescence. Education and Training There are a range of alternative care providers currently practicing in Colorado using the titles: naturopathy, naturopathic medicine, Doctor of Naturopathy, Naturopathic Medical Doctor, and Naturopathic Physician. Their training varies from ten-lesson correspondence courses requiring little or no previous education to the four-year postgraduate medical education of CANP members. Naturopathic Medical Colleges There are presently three naturopathic medical colleges in the United States: Bastyr University (Bastyr) in Seattle, Washington; National College of Naturopathic Medicine (NCNM) in Portland, Oregon; and the Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine & Health Sciences (SCNM) in Scottsdale, Arizona. The U.S. Department of Education recognizes the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME) as the national agency for accreditation of naturopathic medical curriculum. For accreditation, the CNME requires four years of graduate level study in medical sciences and naturopathic therapeutics. Both the Naturopathic Medicine Program at Bastyr and the NCNM are accredited by the CNME. SCNM is a candidate for accreditation from the Commission on Accreditation of the CNME. A minimum of three years of undergraduate premedical study from an accredited college or university is a prerequisite for entry to a naturopathic medical school. The naturopathic medical college program is a four-year post-graduate curriculum. The first two years of study focus on the standard medical sciences (e.g., anatomy, physiology, pathology, biochemistry, immunology, embryology, and related areas), with specialty courses required in pediatrics, obstetrics, cardiology, dermatology, neurology, urology, and other clinical sciences.  6   Introduction The second two years focus on clinical skills and the range of natural therapeutics. Naturopathic physicians are trained in naturopathic therapeutics including botanical medicine, homeopathy, natural childbirth, acupuncture, hydrotherapy, naturopathic manipulative therapy, and therapeutic nutrition. Along with natural therapies, one full year of training is required in physical diagnosis, as well as laboratory and x-ray diagnosis. Pharmacology is also taught as naturopathic physicians have limited prescriptive authority in some states where they are licensed. For this reason, they need to be aware of the effects of drugs and their side effects. The Clinical Internship consists of 1500 hours of treating patients under the supervision of licensed naturopathic and conventional medical physicians. Bastyr University was founded in 1978 to train naturopathic physicians with a scientific approach. Since then, degree programs in nutrition, acupuncture and oriental medicine, and psychology have been added. In addition to accreditation by CNME, Bastyr is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Northwest Association of Schools and Colleges. Bastyr was awarded funding by the National Institutes of Health, Office of Alternative Medicine to establish the AIDS Research Center. Bastyr is conducting a nation-wide study on the use of alternative/complementary therapies for the treatment of HIV/AIDS. Founded in 1956, the National College of Naturopathic Medicine is the oldest naturopathic medical school in North America. The Naturopathic Physician (N.D.) degree is an intensive four-year graduate program that prepares graduates for licensure and the general practice of naturopathic medicine. At NCNM, for example, clinical training hours comprise 1,974 of the total 4,824 hours of instruction. These hours consist of externships at an on-campus clinic where students work under the supervision of a licensed naturopathic physician in private practice and at numerous off-campus clinics serving the general population. In addition, students must demonstrate competence in specific skills, knowledge, judgment, professional and ethical behavior, and communication skills. NCNM has a post-graduate program for training in a specialty area, but opportunities are limited. The Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine program began at the Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine & Health Sciences in 1993. The SCNM is approved by the Arizona Naturopathic Physicians Board of Medical Examiners and the Arizona Board for Private Postsecondary Education. The graduate medical-degree program takes four academic years to complete. Upon completion of the graduation requirements, the student is awarded a Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine, N.D. or N.M.D. degree. The Residency Program at SCNM, under the direction of the Dean of Postgraduate Medical Education, provides for a limited number of openings each calendar year. Residencies are based on one- or two-year experiences. The charts on pages 10 & 11 illustrate course requirements, hours required, cost of program, and accreditation information for both the correspondence schools and naturopathic medical colleges offering degrees in naturopathy or naturopathic medicine.  7   Introduction Correspondence Schools There are a variety of correspondence schools that offer N.D., Doctor of Naturopathy and Ph.D. degrees for a fee after completing correspondence courses. Many of these correspondence schools proclaim accreditation. However, the U.S. Department of Education has not recognized these accreditation agencies. The prerequisites to participate in these programs vary greatly. Students graduating from correspondence schools would not qualify for licensure as an naturopathic physician in states that require licensure to practice. The following school descriptions are taken from school brochures and Internet sites: The Clayton College of Natural Health offers three different degree programs in Naturopathy from the School of Natural Health: a single degree program for a Doctor of Naturopathy; a two-degree combination program for a M.S./Doctor of Naturopathy; and a three-degree combination program for a B.S./M.S./Doctor of Naturopathy. In addition, the School of Naturopathic Medical Education offers a Naturopathic Medical Degree to licensed M.D.'s and D.O.'s. Clayton College is accredited by the World Association of Universities and Colleges (WAUC). The U.S. Department of Education does not recognize WAUC as an official accreditation agency. The Hallmark School of Natural Healing offers a basic naturopath program and upon completion of the program, students receive a ""certified naturopath"" diploma. A period of not more than two years from enrollment date is allowed for the completion of the Basic Naturopath Program. The Herbal Healer Academy (HHA) is a private membership organization, offering alternative natural medicines, herbs, homeopathic remedies, tinctures, health books, videos, flower essences, essential oils, soap kits, hair analysis, private N.D. correspondence consultations, ear coning, herbal teas, and more. In addition, HHA offers natural medicine correspondence courses to acquire an N.D. (naturopathic doctor) diploma. The curriculum is approved for board certification by the American Naturopathic Medical Certification & Accreditation Board (ANMCAB). The ANMCAB is an incorporated entity that issues accreditation to correspondence schools for a fee. The U.S. Department of Education does not recognize ANMCAB as an official accreditation agency. The Progressive Universal Life Church offers degree, diploma and ordination programs by correspondence. In addition to a Ph.D. in naturopathy, they offer degrees and diplomas in Healing, Tarot, Astrology, Psychic, Herbology, Dreams, Clairvoyant, Exorcisms, Ufology, and Dowsing. Certificates may be awarded for life, work, or educational experience. The Progressive Universal Life Church is accredited by the World Accrediting Association which is not recognized by the U.S. Department of Education as an official accreditation agency.  8   Introduction The School of Natural Medicine was founded in Cambridge, England and is now based in Boulder, Colorado. The school offers home study courses in naturopathy. Qualifications are met by completing the home study as well as attending summer school in Boulder during August for three weeks. The School of Natural Medicine ""seeks worthy students who love health and healing and who are willing to become living examples and guides for others."" The Trinity School of Natural Health offers a Doctor of Naturopathy (N.D.). The Trinity School is not designed to provide a vocational curriculum that meets the requirement of any particular state where a license is required. Programs are for personal enrichment, selfimprovement and focus on a pure, unadulterated lifestyle. The Westbrook University, College of Natural Health Sciences offers a Doctor of Naturopathy (N.D.). The University offers diplomas, certificates, and Associate, Bachelor, Master and Doctorate degrees through distance learning. The courses offered for various degrees have a foundation of spiritual healing that will assist a student in entering a professional healing ministry. Incoming credits for life/work experiences may be applied to fulfill many of the requirements. Westbrook is licensed by the New Mexico Commission on Higher Education. It is accredited by the American Naturopathic Medical Certification and Accreditation Board, Inc. and the International Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities; neither of which are recognized by the U.S. Department of Education as an official accreditation agency. The charts on the following pages offer a more detailed comparison among selected correspondence and onsite naturopathic programs in the United States. These schools are representative of the spectrum of schools offering naturopathic degrees.  9   Introduction Comparison of Selected Schools Offering Naturopathic Degrees Year Began Herbal Healer Academy 1988  Degree Offered N.D. certificate  Onsite or Correspondence Correspondence  Required Courses Herbology Nutrition & Chemistry Anatomy & Physiology Reflexology Acupuncture Homeopathy Massage Psychology of Healing Chronic Diseases, Plagues and Death & Dying Basic Business & Practice of Naturopathy Final exam Total Nutritional Healing Basic Nutrition Reflexology Self Esteem & Peak Performance Parasites Basic Anatomy Basic Chemistry Herbology  Hours Required no time limit  Cost of Program 22 lessons/$396 $300 $125 $95 $110 $250 $200 $175 $200 $180 $50 $2,081 $300 $300 $275 $250 $100 $500 $800 $125 $2,650 Total $592.93 - Total Materials $624.55 $100 $100 $168 $89.50 $1,082.05 Total Materials $3,877.05 - Tuition costs $295  Accreditation American Naturopathic Medical Certification & Accreditation Board, Inc.

To date, the sole purpose of NPLEX has been to prepare an examination which may be administered by licensing jurisdictions to qualified applicants with the objective of identifying those individuals who have the knowledge and the skills necessary to be licensed as naturopathic physicians. NPLEX contracted with the National Assessment Institute for the initial development of the examination. A questionnaire was sent to Licensed Naturopathic Physicians nationwide to determine which functions of diagnosis and treatment were being encountered in practice, and to assess the level of frequency and criticality associated with each aspect. A set of seven clinical examination blueprints were developed, on which NPLEX is based. Two ""add-on"" exams (in Homeopathy and Minor Surgery) were also made available to jurisdictions that required demonstrated competence in these areas. NPLEX completed a second criterion-related validity study in 1995 and implemented a new procedure for verifying the passing score. The National Assessment Institute set standards for test development, administration, item review, and scoring; all of which are followed today. NPLEX has contracted with other organizations (including Columbia Assessment Services and the Washington State Department of Health) to provide the exam production and scoring services. Gradually NPLEX has taken over more of the responsibility for this process. For the purposes of the naturopathic physicians' request for licensure, the Department of Regulatory Agencies, Division of Registrations' testing expert reviewed the examination development, scoring and security of NPLEX. The review included such specific questions as: * * * What topics are covered on the test? Do they represent knowledge or ability areas that are most important to safe, effective public practice? Who in terms of professional position, writes the test questions; who reviews and edits them; who has final approval of the questions; and who assembles the test? Are test questions administered experimentally before they are included on a test for official scoring?  The conclusion of the review was that the NPLEX satisfies the standards applicable to credentialing tests. Please see Appendix A for the findings and conclusions of this report.  12   Proposal for Regulation Request for Licensure The Department of Regulatory Agencies (DORA) has evaluated the proposal for state licensure of naturopathic physicians submitted by the Colorado Association of Naturopathic Physicians (CANP). The applicant argues that the state should license naturopathic physicians because naturopathic medicine is an autonomous profession and is considered by some to be a form of the practice of medicine. This profession needs to have independent regulation and the accompanying individual responsibility. CANP asserts that there are a range of alternative care providers currently practicing in Colorado using the name naturopathy and naturopathic medicine. Their training varies from ten-lesson correspondence courses requiring little or no previous education to the four-year postgraduate medical education of CANP members. The applicant contends that the general public cannot determine the competence of these practitioners without licensure. The applicant further argues that licensure would:       Protect the public by establishing acceptable standards of practice with which naturopathic physicians would be required to comply, and to maintain credentials; Allow for discipline or restrictions of practice of those naturopathic physicians participating in unethical or dangerous practice; Provide a place within Colorado for consumers to make complaints; Establish mechanisms to investigate claims of qualifications and to prevent false credentials from being used; Define a scope of practice that will be enforced; Provide the public with means to easily and clearly recognize the difference in education between different types of naturopathic practitioners who all call themselves N.D., naturopathic doctor; or N.M.D. (naturopathic medical doctor). Give the public freedom of choice in health care and provide access to natural health care. At the same time, guarantee the public that they are being treated by well trained, qualified practitioners.    13   Proposal for Regulation The regulatory scheme is envisioned as being similar to existing legislation in other states. The following components would characterize the program:    Licensing program administered by the Division of Registrations located within the Department of Regulatory Agencies; Establishment of minimum education standards, including a degree from an accredited naturopathic medical college; and Passing scores on the NPLEX and local jurisprudence examinations.  The applicant maintains that licensing will likely cause an increase in the number of practitioners in Colorado. The profession is growing rapidly as evidenced in a study done by the Health Policy Institute, Medical College of Wisconsin. This study projects that the per capita supply of alternative medicine clinicians (chiropractors, naturopaths, and practitioners of oriental medicine) will increase by 88% by the year 2010, while the supply of traditional physicians will grow by only 16%.1 The study projects that the number of naturopaths will approximately triple by the year 2010. Most new graduates of CNME accredited naturopathic programs prefer to open practices in states which license the profession. Without licensing, their legal status as health care practitioners is unclear, the ability to establish and maintain good referral networks with other health care practitioners is hindered, and their access to laboratory diagnostic services may be limited. In 1997, a survey conducted at the Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine revealed that of the 43 graduating students only three planned to practice in Colorado. When asked how many would move to Colorado if there was a licensing law, 13 responded that they would open a practice here.  Cooper R.A. and S.J. Stoflet. ""Trends in the Education and Practice of Alternative Medicine Clinicians."" Health Affairs, Fall 1996, 15 (3): 226-38.  1  14   Opposition to Regulation Not everyone agrees that naturopathy represents an appropriate form of health care. To some, many of the therapies used by naturopaths represent unscientific treatments that may at best be benign and at worst be harmful. The argument made against naturopathy is that if these therapies were to be proven scientifically valid, they would be adopted by medical doctors and would become mainstream. During the Sunset Review process, DORA made every effort to elicit information and comments from all interested parties. Several opponents of licensure for naturopathic physicians responded to the sunrise application by submitting opposition papers and letters to DORA. The Coalition for Natural Health, the National Council Against Health Fraud, and the Colorado Medical Society oppose regulation. Coalition for Natural Health The mission of the Coalition for Natural Health (CNH) is to ""educate the public as to the true meaning and benefits of naturopathy, educate legislators on the difference between true naturopathy and naturopathic medicine, prevent legislation that would prohibit true naturopaths from practicing now and in the future, and keep true naturopathy in the public domain. It is CNH's goal to prevent a small special interest group from controlling naturopathy and natural health."" CNH submitted a 68-page document to DORA in response to the naturopathic physician's sunrise application. DORA met with CNH to discuss their various concerns. The following comments are from this document: Traditional naturopathy and AANP-style naturopathic medicine are two distinctly different approaches to healthcare. Naturopathy as practiced by traditional naturopaths, is inherently safe and is not in need of regulation. Conversely, there are definite health safety issues involved in the practice of AANP-style naturopathic medicine and that Colorado should not authorize or license it. The American Association of Naturopathic Physicians (AANP) attempts to redefine naturopathy into naturopathic medicine. ... Part of the redefinition of naturopathy, by the AANP is the push to pass licensure statutes in every state that creates a monopoly of the field of naturopathic medicine. The problem with this monopolistic policy initiative is the purposeful exclusion of a much larger population of practicing naturopaths.  15   Opposition to Regulation Colorado Association of Naturopathic Physicians' Response to the Coalition for Natural Health: The naturopathic profession in this country was founded by Dr. Benedict Lust one hundred years ago. He established a college to provide education for this new type of practitioner. The naturopathic licensing laws from that era included the broadest scope of practice possible, because the profession was seen as medical practice. The profession was conceived and still exists as a medical practice. States that regulate naturopathy through licensing have developed their laws over the years to make the naturopathic scope of practice reflective of modern scientific and educational standards, and to require the profession to meet the same kinds of public accountability measures required of health professions. ... Naturopathic Physicians are trained to diagnose and treat disease -- the untrained or superficially trained ""traditional naturopath"" is not -- and this is completely consistent with the profession's history and development. ... The CANP does not support legislation that would affect what nonlicensed naturopaths would do with regard to their clients. They would remain unregulated, with the exception of title usage. They would be precluded from using the terms naturopath, naturopathic doctor or naturopathic physician. There are far better descriptors such as natural health advisor or health consultant. National Council Against Health Fraud The National Council Against Health Fraud (NCAHF) is a non-profit, tax-exempt voluntary health agency whose leadership appears to be comprised of medical doctors and other mainstream medical personnel. The organization's membership is also comprised of nurses, educators, researchers, attorneys and concerned citizens. NCAHF focuses its attention upon health fraud, misinformation, and quackery as public health problems. The Colorado Area Coordinator of the NCAHF submitted a letter to DORA urging the denial of licensure for naturopathic physicians for the following reasons. They did not submit any supporting documentation with their letter.  Naturopaths are insufficiently educated to diagnose and treat - Naturopaths are schooled in ""conversational medicine"" and learn a medieval philosophy of medicine along with a plethora of non-scientific practices. Naturopaths are a public health risk, particularly to children - Naturopaths condemn fluoridation, pasteurization and immunization.    16   Opposition to Regulation  Naturopathy has no standards - Absolutely anything is permissible as a treatment, and patients therefore become guinea pigs. Naturopaths prescribe mostly worthless treatments. All divert patients away from evidence-based care. Naturopaths prey on the weak, vulnerable, mentally ill, and uneducated - They foster life-long dependence on their care and thereby violate the principle of ""do no harm."" Naturopaths are also renowned for scaring patients away from modern medicine. The CANP should reasonably be expected to speak more fully about the financial impact of licensure to Colorado health consumers. CANP has not resolved the problem of the cost of setting up a regulatory board for a handful of practitioners. CANP seeks to eliminate less educated naturopathic competitors and gain third party and Medicare reimbursement. The difference between more and less educated Naturopaths is not worthy of discussion -- it's like comparing more and less educated witch doctors. It could actually be argued that less schooled Naturopaths are safer because they may have a smaller bag of tricks and, because they don't consider themselves `primary health physicians' are more apt to refer patients to M.D.s for additional care.        Colorado Medical Society The Colorado Medical Society (CMS) submitted a letter opposing the regulation of the practice of Naturopathic Medicine. The reasons for their opposition are repeated below: The CMS believes that those who request licensure for alternative practitioners must prove by appropriately controlled peer reviewed trials that the naturopathic remedies are effective and safe for the purposes for which they are used. These natural treatments must be subjected to various scientific examinations, be systematically replicated, subjected to double blind controlled studies and not based on anecdotal evidence of efficacy if the public health is to be protected. This has not been done. Naturopaths lack appropriate education and training to be granted the full practice of medicine excluding major surgery and the use of most prescriptive drugs. The educational requirements for graduation from a school of naturopathic medicine are significantly substandard to those requirements for graduation from a school of medicine or osteopathic medicine. In addition, naturopathic licensure requires no residency training. This difference between the education of naturopaths and that of medical doctors forces CMS to vigorously oppose the regulation of naturopaths.  17   Opposition to Regulation National Medical Journals and Consumer Health Journals Dispute Some Opposition's Claims The National Council Against Health Fraud argues that alternative therapies can delay the application of conventional medical treatments, thus leading to reduced health status and increased medical expenditures. Although the NCAHF raises legitimate concerns, research conducted for this review found studies published in professional medical journals and federal and state government reports that does not support all of the above-mentioned beliefs. Published studies in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) and The New England Journal of Medicine do not support the theory that individuals who choose alternative therapies avoid traditional western medical care. Rather they utilize a combination of both. Dr. David M. Eisenberg's article, ""Unconventional Medicine in the United States: Prevalence, Costs, and Patterns of Use,"" in The New England Journal of Medicine found that more than 50% of those patients who reported that they sought treatment from alternative medicine practitioners were concurrently under the care of a conventional physician. The article reported that the use of unconventional therapy was significantly more common among persons 25 to 49 years of age and among persons with some college education than among those with no college education. In addition, the Eisenberg article reports the following: Unconventional therapies are generally used as adjuncts to conventional therapy, rather than as replacements for it. Users of unconventional therapy were more likely to see a medical doctor than a provider of unconventional therapy, and visits to providers for serious medical conditions in the absence of contact with a medical doctor were rare. Moreover, in contrast to previous reports of research involving patients with cancer, no respondents in this national survey who identified cancer as a principal medical problem reported seeing a provider of unconventional therapy without also seeing a medical doctor for this condition.2  2  Eisenberg, David M. et al. ""Unconventional Medicine in the United States: Prevalence, Costs, and Patterns of Use."" The New England Journal of Medicine, January 28, 1993, p.251.  18   Opposition to Regulation An article published in the May 20, 1998 issue of JAMA reports the results of a study on why patients use alternative medicine. A survey was designed to examine use of alternative health care, health status, values, and attitudes toward conventional medicine. The survey concluded the following: Dissatisfaction with conventional medicine did not predict use of alternative medicine. Only 4.4% of those surveyed reported relying primarily on alternative therapies. Along with being more educated and reporting poorer health status, the majority of alternative medicine users appear to be doing so not so much as a result of being dissatisfied with conventional medicine but largely because they find these health care alternatives to be more congruent with their own values, beliefs, and philosophical orientations toward health and life.3 The July/August 1998 issue of Rx Remedy, a consumer journal providing health information, reported on naturopathic doctors and their use of herbal medicine. The article noted that scientific studies are underway, financed by the National Institutes of Health's Office of Alternative Medicine. For example, at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, Chinese herbs are being tested for menopausal hot flashes. At Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, the effectiveness of Indian herbs against Parkinson's disease is being researched.  Astin, John A.

In states that do not have naturopathy practice acts, the use of naturopathy may be considered to be the practice of medicine for which a medical license is required. In some jurisdictions, the scope of practice for naturopathy includes alternative modalities such as acupuncture, biofeedback, homeopathy, hypnotherapy or massage. A few statutes permit naturopaths to perform minor surgery and naturopathic or natural childbirth. In general, the practice acts allow naturopaths to utilize an extensive array of adjunctive therapies and procedures. Of the eleven jurisdictions with naturopathy practice acts, six states have established independent boards to regulate this profession. Three states regulate naturopathy at the department level, with assistance from advisory committees. In two states, boards of alternative health care regulate naturopathic physicians. All the practice acts authorize naturopaths through licensure. In several states, licensees must also have a special certificate to practice natural childbirth, acupuncture, or to dispense natural substances or devices. The legal status of naturopathic physicians varies from state to state. The charts on the following pages summarize the regulation of naturopathic physicians in other states including: type of law, regulatory agency, number of licensees, complaint activity, examination requirements, education requirements, and scope of practice.  20   Regulation in Other States STATE Alaska Arizona YEAR LAW ENACTED 1986 1935 TYPE OF LAW Licensure Licensure TITLE Naturopathic Doctor May not use term ""physician"".

The Coalition for Natural Health estimates that there are several hundred naturopaths practicing in Colorado. A recent memo from the Coalition states the following: Training to become a traditional naturopath may be obtained from several different sources such as: distance education programs that lead to an N.D. degree, apprenticeships, from community/family members, institutions that specialize in teaching a particular type of therapy, specific courses, seminars, conference workshop, and in some cases, formal education of required duration in an accredited institution. In arriving at the conservative figure of several hundred, CNH surveyed its members and pledges in your state, which alone exceeds a hundred, contacted several educational institutions that have degree programs in naturopathy, and contacted some related trade and professional organizations. The total figure arrived at from this informal survey was 621 individuals. CNH realizes that there is probably overlap between its members, the various educational institutions, and other trade and professional organizations. The 34 Colorado naturopathic physicians belonging to the Colorado Association of Naturopathic Physicians (CANP) estimate an average patient load of 2,000 patients per naturopathic physician. The CANP was formed in 1985 and recognized by the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians (AANP) in Fall 1987. This professional association of naturopathic physicians was formed to promote the merits of naturopathic medicine in Colorado and to work towards a law which would enable qualified naturopathic physicians to practice. Active members in the CANP must hold either a valid license to practice naturopathic medicine in a state with a board of examiners recognized by the AANP or hold a degree of Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine from a naturopathic medical college approved by the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education. The CANP establishes and maintains basic levels of competence in its membership in order to better serve and protect the public. Currently, the practice of naturopathic medicine has an uncertain status in the state of Colorado. There are no laws to regulate its practice or establish standards for its scope of practice. Naturopathic physicians are not on the list of exempted professions from the Medical Practice Act, and since the practice of naturopathic medicine involves activities described as the practice of medicine, it can be concluded that persons practicing naturopathic medicine could be in violation of the law. Sloans Lake Health Plan is the first HMO in Colorado to develop credentialing standards for alternative care providers. This HMO offers alternative care in homeopathy, naturopathy, and Ayurveda to their customers. The Sloans Lake plan requires naturopathic physicians to be graduates from a CNME accredited college or university. Customers of this HMO may purchase a rider to their plan, in order to utilize the services of alternative health care practitioners.  23   Conclusions and Recommendations Sunrise Analysis The sunrise process requires the Department of Regulatory Agencies to evaluate whether regulation of naturopathic physicians is necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare; whether the public will benefit from the professional competence imposed by the proposed regulation; and whether public protection can be achieved by other, more costeffective means. Public Harm Currently, the public has no reliable way of determining the education or training of someone who practices naturopathy. It is reasonable to conclude that there is a vast difference in the knowledge and abilities of someone who has graduated from a four-year college program in naturopathic medicine and someone who has taken a three-week correspondence course. The applicants have submitted information demonstrating that harm to the public has occurred, or the public was endangered by the threat of potential harm from the unregulated practice of naturopathy. A review of these cases reveals that some naturopaths are alleged to have caused significant harm, while others are alleged to have engaged in inappropriate conduct, which did not result in health-related harm. Following are illustrations of harm that have been provided by the applicant seeking regulation. Case 1: Naturopathic physician in Idaho sentenced to four years probation for mail fraud and mislabeling a controlled substance. (Idaho Falls Post Register, November 10, 1995) Charged with distributing diazepam, the active ingredient in the tranquilizer Valium, without proper labeling. In Idaho, naturopathic physicians are not licensed, and no state regulatory agencies monitor them. Case 2: New Hampshire resident suffering from intense pain was mistreated by three unlicensed naturopathic practitioners. (testimony before the New Hampshire General Assembly regarding the practice of naturopathic physicians). The first practitioner prescribed a supplement that caused a severe allergic reaction and the second practitioner performed a procedure specifically against the patient's wishes. The third practitioner, who consistently canceled appointments, prescribed supplements that were ineffective.  24   Conclusions and Recommendations Case 3: Patient in Colorado was misdiagnosed by a naturopathic practitioner as having a hiatal hernia. (Durango Herald, June 30, 1996) In reality, the patient was suffering from gallstones and had emergency surgery to remove a large gallstone that was infected, enlarged and threatened other nearby organs. The naturopathic practitioner did not have a degree from a CNME accredited naturopathic medical college. Case 4: Naturopathic physician practicing in Colorado with other alternative medicine providers behaved sexually inappropriately with patients and practiced unsafe hazardous waste disposal procedures. (letter dated June 24, 1997 received from an alternative health care practitioner) A naturopathic physician offered inappropriate sexual comments and procedures to his patients. In addition, the naturopath did not dispose of biohazard material safely. Case 5: A naturopathic practitioner in Colorado used ""Bioenergentic Screening"" to diagnose a parasite in a patient. (letter dated July 18, 1996 from an M.D. to the Colorado State Board of Medical Examiners). A medical doctor treated a patient who was previously diagnosed by a naturopath as having a parasite. The patient was charged $100 by the naturopath for the diagnosis and $45 for the remedies. The treatment was not successful. Case 6: Colorado resident offered cure for cancer. (letter dated September 5, 1998 from the patient to the Department of Regulatory Agencies) A naturopath offered an herbal ""cure for cancer"" to a Colorado resident who has leukemia. The naturopath knew little about the formula and was only interested in selling it to the Colorado resident. Case 7: California naturopath arrested for sexually molesting women. (article in the Los Angeles Times, November 4, 1996). A naturopath was arrested and held on $500,000 bail for sexually molesting women while performing vaginal ozone treatments. The practicing naturopath had a doctorate in naturopathy from a non-accredited correspondence school in Arizona that no longer exists. A majority of these illustrations of physical and financial harm were caused by individuals who identified themselves as naturopaths, but had not graduated from CNME-accredited institutions. While there are examples of such harm, it is subject to debate whether or not the seriousness or frequency of such harm rises to the level of requiring regulation or, whether regulation would have prevented them from occurring. Benefits of Regulation 25   Conclusions and Recommendations There are currently 34 naturopathic physicians practicing in Colorado who have graduated from a CNME accredited naturopathic medical college. Since they are unregulated, they cannot perform the full range of services that they are trained to perform, because some services could be interpreted as the practice of medicine. There are other problems for the practitioner and the patient in the current system. Without licensure, naturopathic physicians cannot secure malpractice insurance that would provide additional safeguards to the public. Nor can they be reimbursed under most insurance plans. Lack of licensing presently inhibits full cooperation between naturopathic medicine and other health care systems. As the system currently operates, if a referral is necessary, the naturopathic physician may find the medical doctor reluctant to consult on that referral, since the naturopathic physician lacks legal authority to practice. The current lack of regulation restricts naturopathic physicians' ability to consult with other health professionals and to make use of community diagnostic and treatment services, such as laboratory work and diagnostic x-rays. Naturopathic physicians focus on prevention as the key to better health. Regulation of naturopathic physicians would increase access to primary health care practitioners and encourage wellness and preventive care. Few people have the time or expertise to investigate any health care practitioner's education or credentials. One of the purposes of regulation is to assure a level of education and competency. Often, consumers cannot reasonably determine the level of competency of a naturopath. Regulation may assist the consumer in choosing a provider with appropriate training and skills. Other Issues Although the sunrise review conducted in 1993 recommended against regulation, a bill for full regulation and licensure of naturopathic physicians was introduced in the General Assembly, indicating that the Joint Sunrise/Sunset Committee found that regulation was necessary. While it is not clear whether the sunrise criteria for regulation have been satisfied, there are reasons to consider regulation of naturopathic physicians: it is possible that the public is confused by the common use of the various forms of the term ""naturopath""; it is possible that the practice of some naturopaths who refer to themselves as ""doctors"" is in violation of the Colorado Consumer Protection Act; and the use of naturopathic and alternative medicine is becoming increasingly mainstream, thus requiring some level of regulatory oversight.  26   Conclusions and Recommendations Public Confusion Since 1993 (the date of the last sunrise review), the demand for, and use of, alternative and complementary medical treatments appear to be increasing. In addition, there has been a proliferation of correspondence schools easily accessible on the Internet that offer a Doctor of Naturopathy degree. These schools all have different standards and graduation/certification requirements. Adding to this confusion, naturopaths often refer to themselves by varying titles, such as:     Naturopathic physician; Naturopathic medical doctor; Doctor of Naturopathy; and N.D.  In addition, the distinction between other forms of alternative medicine is not necessarily known or fully understood by the public. For example, many members of the public do not know the difference between a homeopath and a naturopath. Regulation of naturopaths may help to increase public awareness and assist the public in determining which qualifications to look for in a practitioner. Colorado Consumer Protection Act According to the Colorado Office of the Attorney General, there are currently persons using the title Ph.D. in Naturopathy in Colorado who violate the Consumer Protection Act (CPA),  6-1-105 (1)(dd)(I), C.R.S. The CPA states that persons engage in deceptive trade practices when they claim, either orally or in writing, to possess an academic degree or an honorary degree of the title associated with that degree, unless the person has been awarded the degree from an institution that is: 1. accredited by a regional or professional accrediting agency recognized by the U.S. Department of Education or the Council on Post-secondary Accreditation; 2. a school, institute, college, or university chartered outside the United States, the academic degree has been validated by an accrediting agency approved by the U.S. Department of Education; or 3. a religious seminary, institute, college, or university which prepares students for a religious, vocation, career, occupation, profession, or lifework.  27   Conclusions and Recommendations In addition, the CPA states that persons may not use ""Dr."", ""Ph.D."", ""Ed.D."", ""D.N."", or ""D.Th"" or any other title that signifies they have a doctorate degree, unless their degree falls under the auspices of the three previously mentioned criteria. None of the doctorate degrees from the correspondence schools satisfy these criteria. The education, training, and philosophy of correspondence school graduates are substantially different from that of the CNME graduates. There is potential for confusion for the Colorado resident trying to differentiate among the various persons calling themselves naturopaths, naturopathic physicians, doctor of naturopathy, N.D., Ph.D in naturopathy, or naturopathic medical doctors. While the CPA offers some protection to the public against the illegal use of degree titles, a formal regulatory program would offer greater protection and more consistent and thorough oversight. Mainstreaming Alternative Medicine Research both in the United States and abroad suggests that significant numbers of people are receiving various forms of complementary alternative medicine treatments. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) of the United Nations, between 65% and 80% of the world's health services currently would fall under the rubric of complementary and alternative medicine. Pharmacists and medical doctors recognize that herbs and medicinal plants have been used to treat disease for a long period of time. An estimated 500 million people in the world are treated with homeopathic remedies. The WHO has listed homeopathy as one of the traditional complementary alternative medicine treatments that, if integrated with modern medicine, will provide adequate health care across the globe in the future. Dr. David Eisenberg's (professor at Harvard Medical School) study published in the January 1993 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, reported that one-third of Americans had - on their own initiative - used at least one alternative healing method within the previous year. One-third of these had gone to alternative practitioners (such as chiropractors, acupuncturists, naturopaths), with the remainder using natural self-care methods like nutritional supplements and meditation/relaxation techniques. The same study also found that the number of visits to alternative health care practitioners exceeded the number of visits to medical doctors.  28   Conclusions and Recommendations A few health insurance companies responding to customer demand include coverage for alternative therapies in their plans. Sloans Lake HMO Health Plan in Colorado offers their customers a rider to their policy that provides for alternative care providers. American West Life and Presbyterian Health Plan of New Mexico offer members access to alternative care through a point-of-service plan by covering it on an out-of-plan basis. For its patients in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, Oxford Health Plans, Inc., offers a policy rider for an additional 3% that covers visits to chiropractors, acupuncturists, naturopaths, and massage therapists included on Oxford's list of 1,000 alternative health care providers. The March 4, 1998 issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association reported on alternative medicine and the conventional practitioner. Recognizing the increasing importance of complementary and alternative medicine in modern health care, more than 80% of medical students expressed the desire for further training in these areas.4 Currently, over 40 medical schools in the U.S. offer introductory elective courses in alternative medicine and almost one third of family practice residences provide some type of instruction about alternative medical practices.5 Regulatory Models If the General Assembly determines that further regulation of naturopathy is warranted, two regulatory models would be reasonable to consider further protecting the title beyond that found in the Consumer Protection Act, or licensing of naturopaths. Title Protection A title protection program could be modeled after the dietitian provisions of the Colorado Consumer Protection Act, 6-1-105(1)(ee.5), C.R.S. Following this model, the term ""naturopath"" would be reserved for those persons who have graduated from an approved naturopathic medical college accredited by the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME). CNME is recognized by the U.S. Department of Education as the national agency for accreditation of naturopathic medical curriculum. Such a regulatory scheme possesses the advantage of offering the public a certain degree of protection and is less restrictive than a licensing program. Under a title protection scheme, enforcement would be taken pursuant to the Colorado Consumer Protection Act.  Furnham, A., Hanna, D., Vincent C.A., ""Medical Students' Attitude to Complementary Medical Therapies. Comp Ther Med 1995, 3:212-219.. 5 Carlston, M., Stuart M., Jonas, W. ""Alternative Medicine Instruction in Medical Schools and Family Medicine Residency Programs."" Fam Med., 1997. 29:559-562.  4  29   Conclusions and Recommendations Licensure Program Should the General Assembly determine that regulation of naturopathic physicians is necessary, a licensing scheme administered by the Director of the Division of Registrations could provide adequate public protection. Such a regulatory program should include provisions addressing the following issues:  Title Protection for ""Licensed Naturopaths."" Title protection will assist the public in identifying those individuals the state has determined to be qualified naturopaths. Individuals who satisfy the educational requirements established by the state would be permitted to use the titles ""Licensed Naturopath"", ""Naturopath"" or any derivative thereof. The protected titles would be reserved for those persons with the following credentials: (1) Graduated from an approved naturopathic medical college accredited by or with a curriculum equivalent to the accreditation standards of the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME). CNME is recognized by the U.S. Department of Education as the national agency for accreditation of naturopathic medical curriculum.; and (2) Passed a licensure exam which conforms to the standards approved by the Director of the Division of Registrations.  A definition of the practice of naturopathy. By defining the practice of naturopathy, it will be clear which practitioners fall within the scope of the licensing program. The practice of naturopathy could be defined as: A system of primary health care practiced by ""licensed naturopaths"" for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of human health conditions, injury and disease. Its purpose is to promote or restore health by the support and stimulation of the individual's inherent self-healing process. This is accomplished through education of the patient by a ""licensed naturopath"" and through the use of natural therapies and therapeutic substances.  30   Conclusions and Recommendations  Restricting the practice of Licensed Naturopaths. The restrictions on the practice of ""Licensed Naturopaths"" could prohibit:         Prescribing or giving a prescription drug or a controlled substance Engaging in minor surgery Practicing obstetrics  The program could be cash-funded and located within the Director's Office of the Division of Registrations, Department of Regulatory Agencies. Licensed Naturopaths could be exempted from the Medical Practice Act to allow them to practice the full range of their profession (with the restrictions above). Full range of disciplinary actions against Licensed Naturopaths, including civil penalties, could be available. The Director of the Division of Registrations could be granted the authority to convene a Naturopathic Advisory Committee. An exemption clause could be included, similar to the one in Montana's Naturopathic Licensing Act: This chapter recognizes that many of the therapies used by naturopathic physicians, such as the use of nutritional supplements, herbs, foods, homeopathic preparations, and such physical forces as heat, cold, water, touch, and light, are not the exclusive privilege of naturopathic physicians, and their use, practice, prescription, or administration by persons not licensed to practice naturopathic medicine is not prohibited by this chapter. This chapter does not restrict or apply to the scope of practice of any other professional licensed, certified, or registered under the laws of this state.  A licensing scheme would offer the public the greatest level of regulatory protection.

For the purposes of this subdivision, a physician shall be deemed to  be convicted of a felony if the physician pleaded guilty or was found or adjudged guilty  by a court of competent jurisdiction or has been convicted of a felony by the entry of a  plea of nolo contendere; and  (14) To the extent available, and consistent with the provisions of subsection (c)  of this section, all medical malpractice court judgments and all medical malpractice  arbitration awards against the physician in which a payment was awarded to a complaining party during the last ten years, and all settlements of medical malpractice claims  against the physician in which a payment was made to a complaining party within the  last ten years.

Information concerning all settlements shall  be accompanied by the following statement: ""Settlement of a claim may occur for a  variety of reasons that do not necessarily reflect negatively on the professional competence or conduct of the physician. A payment in settlement of a medical malpractice  action or claim should not be construed as creating a presumption that medical malpractice has occurred.""

A physician shall have sixty days from the date the department  mails or delivers the prepublication copy to dispute the accuracy of any information  that the department proposes to include in such profile and to submit a written statement  setting forth the basis for such dispute. If a physician does not notify the department that  the physician disputes the accuracy of such information within such sixty-day period, the  department shall make the profile available to the public and the physician shall be  deemed to have approved the profile and all information contained therein. If a physician  notifies the department that the physician disputes the accuracy of such information in  accordance with this subsection, the physician's profile shall be released to the public  without the disputed information, but with a statement to the effect that information in  the identified category is currently the subject of a dispute and is therefore not currently  available. Not later than thirty days after the department's receipt of notice of a dispute,  the department shall review any information submitted by the physician in support of  such dispute and determine whether to amend the information contained in the profile.  In the event that the department determines not to amend the disputed information,  the disputed information shall be included in the profile with a statement that such  information is disputed by the physician.  (f) A physician may elect to have the physician's profile omit information provided  pursuant to subdivisions (9) to (11), inclusive, of subsection (b) of this section. In collecting information for such profiles and in the dissemination of such profiles, the department shall inform physicians that they may choose not to provide the information described in said subdivisions (9) to (11), inclusive.

This profile should not, however, be your sole basis for selecting a physician.""  (h) The department shall maintain a web site on the Internet for use by the public  in obtaining profiles of physicians.  (i) No state law that would otherwise prohibit, limit or penalize disclosure of information about a physician shall apply to disclosure of information required by this section.  (j) All information provided by a physician pursuant to this section shall be subject  to the penalties of false statement, pursuant to section 53a-157b.

GX247-01-2908874	Office of the Attorney General  State of Texas               December 19, 1978                    Honorable Max C. Butler, President  Texas State Board of Medical Examiners  Southewest Tower Building, Suite 900  211 East Seventh Street  Austin, Texas 78701          Opinion No. H-1293     Re: What services may a midwife or nurse midwife perform?                       Dear Dr. Butler:     You ask several questions about the services which midwives may legally provide in Texas. Articles 4510, 4510a, and 4510b, V.T.C.S., prohibit the practice of medicine by persons who are not licensed by the Board of Medical Examiners. 'Practicing medicine' is defined as follows:      Any person shall be regarded as practicing medicine within the meaning of this Chapter:     1. Who shall publicly profess to be a physician or surgeon and shall diagnose, treat or offer to treat any disease or disorder, mental or physical, or any physical deformity or injury, by any system or method, or to effect cures thereof.     2. Who shall diagnose, treat or offer to treat any disease or disorder, mental or physical, or any physical deformity or injury, by any system or method, or to effect cures thereof and charge therefor. . . .    V.T.C.S. art. 4510a.     The Court of Criminal Appeals held in Banti v. State, 289 S.W.2d 244 (Tex. Crim. App. 1956), that a midwife who assisted a woman in parturition was not practicing medicine within the statutes. It found no reason why the Legislature could not distinguish in the statutes between the work of a midwife and the practice of medicine. Since childbirth is a normal function of womanhood, the defendant had not treated her client 'for a disease, deformity or injury or effect a cure thereof.' 289 S.W.2d at 247. The court stated as follows:      Not only has the Legislature failed to include within the definition of 'practicing medicine' the branch of medical science which has to do with the care of women during pregnancy and parturition called 'obstetrics' but has in a number of statutes recognized practical obstetrics or midwifery as outside the realm of the medical practice act.    Id. at 247. See V.T.C.S. art. 4441 (doctors, midwives, nurses, or those in attendance at childbirth shall put drops in child's eyes); art. 4477, Rule 46a (physician, midwife, or person acting as midwife shall file birth certificate). The court distinguished two prior opinions upholding convictions for the unauthorized practice of medicine where the patient was a pregnant woman. See Vlassis v. State, 286 S.W.2d 934 (Tex. Crim. App. 1956); DeHay v. State, 254 S.W.2d 513 (Tex. Crim. App. 1953). In each case, the defendant held himself out as a practitioner of medicine and treated others for diseases and disorders. Neither defendant was a midwife and the services rendered to the pregnant woman were not confined to her care at childbirth. Finally, the court noted that pregnancy would not prevent a woman from having a disease, disorder, deformity or injury for which she would require the services of a practitioner of medicine.     You do not question that legal authority exists for a midwife to assist a woman in chidbirth. See also V.T.C.S art. 4445a, s 1 (physician or other person permitted by law to attend a pregnant woman shall have blood sample tested for syphilis); V.T.C.S. art. 4477, Rule 22 (nurse or midwife shall report inflammation of newborn's eyes); Rule 49a (midwives shall register with local registrar of vital statistics). However, you have asked five specific questions about the range of services which a midwife may provide without engaging in the practice of medicine.     We believe that some of your questions cannot be answered without the investigation and resolution of fact questions. See, e.g., Green v. State, 305 S.W.2d 609 (Tex. Crim. App. 1957) (expert testimony that application of coagulating needle constituted the practice of medicine). We do not resolve fact questions in the opinion process; however, we can answer the legal questions you present.     Your first two questions are as follows:      1. May a midwife perform an episiotomy [incision to prevent tearing]?      2. Is the midwife authorized to repair the episiotomy or a laceration of the birth canal by suturing the wound following delivery of the child?     We believe your first two questions cannot be fully answered without the resolution of fact questions. Whether or not a midwife may perform and repair an episiotomy or suture lacerations would depend on whether these services are generally provided in connection with normal childbirth. In Banti, the midwife gave her client an injection. The court did not single out that particular act as the practice of medicine, apparently viewing it as one aspect of assistance at childbirth. If the facts show that these services are incident to normal childbirth, as briefs submitted to us suggest, then we believe the courts would hold that a midwife may provide them.     Your third question is as follows:      3. Is a midwife authorized to possess and administer drugs or medication which are classified as either 'dangerous drugs' under the provisions of article 4476-14, V.T.C.S., or as 'controlled substances' under article 4476- 15, V.T.C.S.?    Article 4476-14, V.T.C.S., regulates the sale and distribution of 'dangerous drugs,' defined to include certain specific substances and any drug or device bearing the legend: 'Caution: federal law prohibits dispensing without prescription.' Sec. 2(3). It makes several exceptions to its prohibitions and regulations regarding the delivery of dangerous drugs. Thus a 'practitioner,' defined to include a licensed physician, may dispense dangerous drugs in the course of his practice. Secs. 2(e), 3(a)(2). Such drugs may be delivered to or possessed by the agents and employees of a practitioner for use in the usual course of business. Sec. 4(a), (b). Thus, a midwife may possess such drugs as a physician's agent.     Article 4476-15, V.T.C.S., regulates the manufacture, delivery, possession, and administration of certain 'controlled substances,' which are listed by name in Schedules I through V of the act. Secs. 2.01-2.07. The Commissioner of Health may add substances to the schedules or delete or reschedule substances enumerated in the act. Sec. 2.09(a). Any person who dispenses a controlled substance must possess a valid registration from the Director of the Texas Department of Public Safety. Sec. 3.01(a); see s 1.02(9). A licensed physician may receive a registration to dispense substances in Schedules II through V upon application and payment of a fee. No provision is made for registration of midwives. However, the agent or employee of a registered dispenser of any controlled substance may possess controlled substances in the usual course of business without also registering. Sec. 3.01(e)(1). A registered physician is a 'dispenser' within the terms of the act. Sec. 1.02(10), (11). In addition, a hospital or other institution may be registered to administer a controlled substance. Sec. 1.02(24). Thus a midwife acting as the agent or employee of a registered physician or hospital is not subject to the registration requirement found in section 3.01(a). In addition a practitioner 'or a person acting under his direction' is excepted from the penalty provision for possession of a hypodermic containing a controlled substance with intent to inject it in a human being. Sec. 4.07(a).     Your fourth question is as follows:      4. Is a midwife authorized to make a diagnosis of disease or obstetrical complication?    It is clear that the diagnosis of a 'disease or disorder, . . . physical deformity or injury' constitutes the practice of medicine. V.T.C.S. arts. 4510, 4510a, 4510b. Consequently, midwives may not make such diagnoses unless they are licensed by the Board of Medical Examiners.     Your final question is as follows:      5. Do the statutes of this state recognize any difference in the authority for the delivery of midwife services by a 'lay midwife,' a 'nurse midwife,' or a 'certified nurse midwife?'    In our opinion, the statutes do recognize differences. Nurse midwives and certified nurse midwives are persons who have been licensed by the Board of Nurse Examiners as professional nurses. Thus the statutes defining 'professional nursing' are relevant to their authority to perform midwife services. 'Professional nursing' is defined in part to include      the performance for compensation of any nursing act (a) in the observation, care and counsel of the ill, injured or infirm; (b) in the maintenance of health or prevention of illness of others; (c) in the administration of medications or treatments as prescribed by a licensed physician or dentist. . . .    V.T.C.S. art. 4518, s 5. This statute provides independent authority for a registered nurse to perform some of the services you inquire about. For example, a nurse may administer treatments prescribed by a physician. Thus, even if performing an episiotomy or making sutures were held to constitute medical treatment, a registered nurse could provide these services at the doctor's direction. See also Attorney General Opinion WW-1403 (1962) (duty of nurse to carry out medical treatment prescribed by a doctor). Nurses also have authority under article 4518, section 5(c) to administer dangerous drugs or controlled substances prescribed by a licensed physician. See Attorney General Opinion H-737 (1975). The authority to observe the ill, injured or infirm given by section 5(a) of article 4518 would in our opinion include the authority to watch for and recognize abnormal symptoms of pregnancy which might lead to a diagnosis of disease or obstetrical complication by the physician.     In each instance, the registered nurse performs services at the instruction or with the supervision of a licensed physician. The appropriate degree of instruction or supervision by the physician will vary with the nurse's experience and qualifications. See generally Attorney General Opinions H-395 (1974); H-27 (1973); Annot., 63 A.L.R.3d 1020 (1975). A certified nurse midwife has completed advanced training in midwifery and has been certified by the American College of Nurse-Midwives, a private body. These qualifications are relevant to a determination of the appropriate degree of instruction and supervision to be provided by a physician.      SUMMARY               The Court of Criminal Appeals has held that midwifery is not the practice of medicine. If it can be shown that performing and repairing an episiotomy or suturing lacerations are services generally performed in connection with normal childbirth, then a midwife may legally perform such services. A midwife may possess and administer statutorily regulated drugs as the agent of a licensed physician. Midwives may not diagnose a disease or obstetrical complication. Registered nurses who are nurse midwives or certified nurse midwives have authority under article 4518, section 5 to perform the services inquired about.        Very truly yours,       John L.

The board may grant waivers of the minimum continuing education requirements for physical disability or illness for any period of time not to exceed one renewal period. In the event that the physical disability or illness upon which a waiver has been granted continues beyond the period of the waiver, the licensee must reapply for an extension of the waiver.

The order to show cause shall also contain a statement of the legal basis for such hearing and for the denial, revocation, or suspension of registration and a summary of the matters of fact and law asserted. If the order to show cause involves the possible denial of registration renewal, the order shall be served not later than 30 days before the expiration of the registration. Proceedings to refuse renewal of registration shall not abate the existing registration, which shall remain in effect pending the outcome of the administrative hearing unless the board issues an order of immediate suspension pursuant to subrule 10.12(9). 10.12(6) Hearing requested. If an applicant or registrant who has received an order to show cause desires a hearing on the matter, the applicant or registrant shall file a request for a hearing within 30 days after the date of service of the order to show cause. If a hearing is requested, the board shall hold a hearing pursuant to 657--Chapter 35 at the time and place stated in the order and without regard to any criminal prosecution or other proceeding.

If an applicant or registrant entitled to a hearing waives or is deemed to have waived the opportunity for a hearing, the executive secretary/director of the board may cancel the hearing and issue, on behalf of the board, the board's final order on the order to show cause. 10.12(9) Order of immediate suspension.

GX267-17-16650491	"Newsletter www.tsbp.state.tx.us Fall 2003  PRESIDENT'S COLUMN by Roger W. Anderson, Dr.P.H., R.Ph.  BUDGET WOES I'm sure all of you have read about the budget crisis faced by Texas during the 2003 regular session of the Texas Legislature. The Legislature's task has always been to make spending and income balance . The difference during this session was that the state of Texas started out $9 billion in the red for the remainder of FY2003 and all of FY2004-2005. Because of this shortfall, the Legislatur e made the decision to cut expenditures for all state agencies. The first cut was ordered in January 2003 and r equir ed all agencies to decr ease spending by 7% by August 31, 2003. This cut w as necessary to mak e up for an approximate $2 billion shortfall during the current fiscal year (9/1/02-8/31/03). For the Texas State Board of Pharmacy (TSBP), this cut amounted to $208,538. The agency had to make some tough decisions to achieve this 7% reduction. After careful deliberation, we chose to:  delay hiring personnel for two vacant positions;  reduce the number of TSBP Newsletters from four to two;  outsource the publication of the TSBP Lawbook; and  reduce staff and Board member conference travel. The second cut the agency had to absorb was a 12.5% reduction in spending for all agencies o v er the amount the y w e r e budgeted for the last biennium. This cut was to cover a $7 billion shortfall for the FY2004-2005 (9/1/03-8/31/05) biennium. For T S B P, the 12.5% cut amounted to $789,696. This reduction forced the agency to continue all of the cuts listed above in addition to the following:  eliminating two positions within the agency;  eliminating the paper edition of the TSBP Newsletter;  delaying replacement of agency vehicles;  reducing the purchase of replacement computer hardware by 48% over the biennium; and  reducing expenditures for staff training.    Now, the good news is that the agency w as giv en an additional $726,269 to implement a pharmacy technician registration program. The net result of all of these actions is that the agency has been budgeted approx imately $246,210 more than it was during the last biennium. H o w e v e r, the agenc y will double the number of registrants/licensees with the addition of approximately 25,000 pharmacy technicians. What this means for you is that you may see some changes in services offered by the agency. For example, this is the last paper edition of the T SBP Ne wsletter. F utur e ne w sletter s will be distributed online. We ar e w orking to offer some alternatives to the electronic copy and will notify you if this becomes available. We are working smarter to maximize use of the r educed funds a v ailable to the agency. One method that allows us to work smarter is the agency's Web site. In the near future you will be able to go online to update y our addr ess and emplo yment information. Despite the budget woes, we remain committed to providing quality services to our licensees and the public.

Flores  (Effective Date: 9/1/03) This is a bill that deals with homeland security. One portion of the bill amends the Pharmacy Act to require a pharmacist to report to the Texas Department of Health(TDH) ""any unusual or increased prescription rates; unusual types of prescriptions, or unusual trends in pharmacy visits that may be caused by bioterrorism, epidemic or pandemic disease, or novel and highly fatal infectious agents or biological toxins that might pose a substantial risk of a significant number of human fatalities or incidents of permanent or long-term disability."" The bill further specifies that pharmacists must report an unusual increase in the number of:  Rxs to treat respiratory or gastrointestinal complaints or fever;  Rxs for antibiotics; and  requests for information on OTCs to treat respiratory or gastrointestinal complaints or fever; and  any Rx that treats a disease that is relatively uncommon and has bioterrorism potential. We will notify you of more specifics about the bill when TDH has the program in place.  H.B. 1095 by Rep. Capelo (Effective Date: 5/20/03) This bill amends the Medical Practices Act to give a physician the authority to delegate to advanced practice nurses (APN) and physician assistants (PA) the authority to administer, provide, and carry out or sign a prescription drug order for a controlled substance. The bill specifies that a physician may delegate to an APN or PA, the authority to carry out a Rx for a controlled substance only if:  the Rx is for a Schedule 3-5 controlled substance;  the Rx is for a period not to exceed 30 days;  refills are authorized only after consultation with the delegating physician and the consultation is noted in the patient's chart; and  Rxs for a child under two, are issued only after consultation with the delegating physician and the consultation is noted in the patient's chart. APNs and PAs who have this authority will be assigned mid-level practitioner DEA numbers and those numbers must be on the prescriptions.  H.B. 1614 by Rep. Truitt  (Effective Date: 6/20/03) This bill establishes a program to promote public accountability through the detection of statewide trends in the occurrences of certain medical errors by:  requiring hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers, and mental hospitals to report errors;  providing the public with statewide summaries of the reports; and  requiring hospitals to implement risk reduction strategies.  The bill also directs the Texas Department of Health to establish a patient safety program that encourages hospitals to share best practices and safety measures that are effective in improving patient safety.  H.B. 1686 by Rep. Chisum (Effective Date: 6/20/03) This bill amends the Pharmacy Act to allow a Class E (Non-Resident) Pharmacy to maintain drugs in an emergency medication kit in a nursing home in Texas provided the pharmacy is located not more than 20 miles from the nursing home. H.B. 2292 by Rep. Wohlgemuth/Sen. Nelson (Effective Date: 9/1/03) This very large bill deals with state policy relating to the financing of state health and human services programs. One section of the bill amends the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Pharmacy Act to allow the return of unused drugs from nursing homes. The bill specifies that a consultant pharmacist in a nursing home may return to a pharmacy see LEGISLATIVE UPDATE on page 6  After the Board obtains evidence of alleged violations, a licensee is sent a preliminary notice letter of the Board's intent to institute disciplinary action. The licensee then has an opportunity to show compliance with the law in an informal conference with a Board Member the Board staff (Executive Director/Secretary, Board Legal Counsel, and other staff at the discretion of the Executive Director and Board Legal Counsel). If the licensee cannot sho w compliance with the law and desires to dispose of any pending allegations, the licensee may consent to the entry of an ""Agreed Board Order."" The licensee must agree to the terms of the order and the order must be approved by the Board. It should be noted that while there is agreement on the part of the licensee to the entry of an ""Agreed Board Order,"" there is neither admission nor denial of guilt with respect to any matters that have come to the attention of the Board. If a licensee, or the Board does not agree to terms of the ""Agreed Board Order"" or if the licensee does not wish to attend an informal conference, a disciplinary hearing is scheduled before an Administrative Law Judge from the Office of Administrative Hearings. The Administrative Law Judge, after hearing all evidence in the matter, will make a recommendation to the Board for action to be taken. The Board then makes a decision in the case, which is documented by the entry of a ""Board Order."" On the finding of the existence of grounds for discipline of a licensee, the Board may suspend, revoke, restrict, fine, refuse to issue or renew, probate, reprimand, or retire a license. The Board has directed that ""Agreed Board Orders"" and ""Board Orders"" be published in the NEWSLETTER. Although every effort is made to assure that the following information is correct, you should contact the Board's office to confirm the accuracy of the listing before making any decision based upon this information. Copies of specific orders may be obtained for a fee, upon written request.  Pius Ayodele Aboloye, License No. 28921, Grand Prairie, TX.

Assistant Director of Enforcement  During FY2003, the Texas State Board of Pharmacy entered 82 disciplinary orders alleging that at least one error had occurred. This represents a 116% increase in this type of orders when compared to the prior year (FY2002). Information regarding these types of disciplinary orders is depicted in the chart below:  Total # of Disciplinary Orders  Total # of Disciplinary Orders Involving Alleged Dispensing Errors  Total # of Alleged Errors  % of Disciplinary Orders Involving More Than One Alleged Error  % of Alleged Errors Resulting in Negative Patient Outcomes  % of Alleged Errors Involving Pediatric Prescriptions  FY2000 FY2001 FY2002 FY2003  126 145 181 213  43 22 38 82  71 36 45 85  37% 18% 8% 7%  37% 61% 62% 92%  25% 31% 13% 44%  FY2003 disciplinary orders included the following types of errors:  TYPE OF ERROR WRONG DRUG  PRESCRIPTION ISSUED FOR Tussi-Organidin liquid Zantac syrup Atarax 25 mg tablets Zestril 20 mg tablets Amitriptyline 10 mg tablets Coumadin 2.5 mg tablets Prednisone 1 mg tablets Atenolol 50 mg tablets  INCORRECTLY DISPENSED AS Tussionex suspension Zyrtec syrup Hydralazine 25 mg tablets Zocor 20 mg tablets Amitriptyline 100 mg tablets Coumadin 5 mg tablets Prednisone 10 mg tablets Atenolol 25 mg tablets  WRONG STRENGTH  WRONG DIRECTIONS Acetaminophen with Codeine Elixir Crixivan 400 mg capsules Zantac syrup  1 - 2 ml every 4 hours 2 capsules three times daily 1 ml three times daily  1 - 2 tsp every 4 hours 1 capsule three times daily 1 tsp three times daily  Approximately 85% of the 85 errors that resulted in disciplinary orders may have been detected (and thus prevented) if a pharmacist had verbally counseled a patient or patient's agent and/or conducted a drug utilization review. In addition, approximately 27% of the 85 errors may have been detected if the dispensing or consulting pharmacist had looked inside the prescription container and compared the contents to the drug name on the prescription label, before giving the prescription container to the patient or patient's agent. Accordingly, the Board encourages pharmacists to read the drug name on the label and look inside the prescription container, before giving the medication to the patient or patient's agent. Pharmacists are also encouraged to review errors that may have occurred in the pharmacy, evaluate their practice setting, and then make any changes necessary to prevent errors from occurring in the future. ""  4  Texas State Board of Pharmacy NEWSLETTER  Fall 2003   COMPLIANCE REMINDERS LAW BOOK The 2003 edition of the TEXAS PHARMACY LAWS is now available to order direct from the publisher LexisNexis at (800) 833-9844 or on the TSBP Web site at www.tsbp.state.tx.us/rules. All Pharmacies must maintain current law references. ELECTRONIC LIBRARY REFERENCES Electronic library references can be maintained in the pharmacy's computer system provided the information is available for immediate retrieval and use. Failure to gain access to the required reference material during a compliance inspection is the same as not having the reference. Electronic references must also be current and updated. NOTIFICATIONS TO THE TSBP All required notifications must be submitted to the TSBP in writing. This information may not be submitted verbally over the telephone. It is especially important that you notify the TSBP of address changes. Forms are available at the TSBP Web site at www.tsbp.state.tx.us. You may fax your changes to the TSBP at (512) 305-8075. CONSUMER ALERT The members of the Texas State Board of Pharmacy are aware that Texans are purchasing prescription drugs from foreign countries including Mexico and Canada. Because this practice could have a negative impact on the health of the citizens of Texas, the TSBP believes that Texans should be informed about the potential dangers of buying foreign drugs. A ""Consumer Alert"" is now available at the TSBP Web site at www.tsbp.state.tx.us, under Consumer Information. CONTINUING EDUCATION REMINDER Pharmacists must now complete and report 30 hours of approved CE during a two-year license period. FAX PRESCRIPTIONS All faxed prescription drug orders must include a statement from the physician's office that the prescription drug order has been electronically transmitted. Designated agents who transmit faxed prescription drug orders must include their full name on the fax. PRESCRIPTION ISSUE DATE Pharmacists are advised to check the prescription issue date and the date entered into the computer with the first initial fill. The issue date is the date the prescription was written and may be different from the date defaulted as the date of fill. Failure to enter the correct issue date will corrupt data in the computer for proper refill time limits on the new order.

Noriega  S.B. 1315 by Sen. Van de Putte/Rep. Capelo  S.B. 1356 by Nelson/Capelo (Effective Date: 6/20/03) During the 1999 Legislative Session, S.B. 1235 was passed making the use of a practitioner's DEA number for any purpose other than that specified by DEA, a third degree felony. Enforcement of this bill was set for September 1, 2003. The intent of this legislation was to require insurance carriers to switch from using the DEA number as a physician identifier to using a federal universal provider number. However, the federal government has not implemented a federal universal provider number. Therefore, in this session, the Legislature has passed S.B. 1356 which amends the Controlled Substances Act to extend the date DPS is required to adopt rules prohibiting the use of the DEA number to:  not earlier than the 180th day after; and  not later than the first anniversary of, the date on which compliance with a rule adopted by the United States Department of Health and Human Services creating a universal provider numbering system is required.

GX266-45-2115262	"This pamphlet has been developed to explain the requirements and the license renewal process for every Pharmacist licensed to practice in Michigan. The Michigan Public Health Code and board administrative rules requires every Pharmacist who has held their license for a full two-year period, to complete, during the 2-year period prior to the expiration date of the license, not less than 30 hours of continuing education in courses or programs approved by the Board. Pursuant to this requirement, the Board of Pharmacy has promulgated rules to establish specific criteria for the Board's approval of continuing education courses and programs. REQUIREMENTS FOR RENEWAL The continuing education requirements apply to every Pharmacist renewing a Michigan license that held the license for more than 1 year immediately preceding the date of the license renewal. The requirements apply whether or not the Pharmacist is actively engaged in the practice of Pharmacy. No one is exempt from this requirement. Each pharmacist who was originally licensed in Michigan more than 1 year but less than 2 years before the renewal date shall have accumulated 15 hours of continuing education. Each Pharmacist who held their license for a full two years before the application for renewal is required to complete 30 hours of continuing education in courses or programs approved by the Board. A  contact hour is equivalent to 50 to 60 minutes. Every Pharmacist who is renewing his/her license should retain records documenting the completion of continuing education. Those documents should be retained for a period of 4 years after the renewal of the license. DO NOT SEND THE CONTINUING EDUCATION DOCUMENTS along with the license renewal application. The Department of Community Health, Bureau of Health Professions will conduct an audit, at the conclusion of the renewal period. Pharmacists chosen for audit through an automated random selection process will be contacted by letter to submit documented evidence of the completion of 15 or 30 hours of continuing education credit. DO NOT RENEW YOUR LICENSE IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE REQUIRED 15 OR 30 HOURS OF CONTINUING EDUCATION CREDITS. A Pharmacist who is unable to provide evidence of completion of the continuing education requirements, when requested, is in violation of the Michigan Public Health Code and subject to one or more of the following possible license sanctions: reprimand, probation, denial, suspension, revocation, limitation, restitution, and fine. Accredited sponsors are required to provide attendance certificates that indicate name of licensee, program dates and number of designated  hours. Further information about programs with accredited sponsorship may be obtained by contacting the accredited sponsor. ""Contact hour"" is the same as one 5060 minute or (1) credit hour. REQUIREMENT FOR RELICENSURE ""Relicensure"" means the granting of a license to a person whose license has lapsed for failure to renew the license within 60 days after the expiration date. Pharmacists applying for relicensure pursuant to R338.477b (1) (b)  COMPLETION OF 30 HOURS OF CONTINUING EDUCATION THAT HAS BEEN EARNED WITHIN THE 2-YEAR PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE APPLICATION FOR RELICENSURE. R 338.3044 COMPUTATION OF CREDIT HOURS. Rule 4 (1) If an organized continuing education course or program is offered in segments of 50 to 60 minutes each, 1 hour of credit shall be given for each such segment. A pharmacist shall not be granted multiple credit for the same program of continuing education in the same licensure renewal period. If audited, the licensee must submit a copy of a letter or certificate showing his/her name, hours earned and the date.   (2) A pharmacist may earn 1 hour of continuing education credit for each hour devoted to an approved self-instructional program. If audited, the licensee must submit a copy of a letter or certificate showing his/her name, hours earned and the date. (3) Two hours of continuing education may be earned for each hour spent actually presenting a course or program, which has been approved for continuing education credit. A presenter shall not be granted multiple credit for the same program of continuing education in the same licensure period. If audited, the licensee must submit a copy of the presentation notice or advertisement showing the date and his/her name listed as a presenter. (4) Twelve hours of continuing education credit may be earned for each 1 academic quarter hour of postgraduate study of a course approved for continuing education credit given by an academic institution approved by the Board. If audited, the licensee must submit a transcript showing credit hours of the academic courses related to Pharmacy. (5) Eighteen hours of continuing education credit may be earned for each 1 academic semester hour of postgraduate study of a course approved for continuing education credit given by an academic institution approved by the board.  If audited, the licensee must submit a copy of the transcript showing credit hours of the academic courses related to Pharmacy. R338.3043 EDUCATION COURSES AND PROGRAMS (4) The American Council on Pharmaceutical Education may certify a sponsor whose course or program was developed and presented in compliance with R338.3042 sub-rule (3). The Board may accept such certification as prima facie proof that a course meets the standards as set forth in R338.3042 sub-rule (3). (5) A sponsor of a course or program that does not fall within sub-rule (4) may submit an application for approval. R338.3045 EQUIVALENTS: PHARMACISTS RESIDING OR PRACTICING IN OTHER STATES. Rule 5 (1) An applicant for renewal who resided or practiced in another state that required substantially equivalent continuing education for renewal may obtain renewal of the Michigan license upon verification of licensure in the other state. (2) An applicant for renewal who resided or practiced in another state that does not fall within sub-rule (1) may obtain renewal of the Michigan license upon proof that the applicant acquired continuing education substantially equivalent to that, which is otherwise required by these rules.  If audited, the licensee must submit a copy of current license that was renewed in another state, proof of continuing education requirements that were met to renew that license, proof of practicing and residing in said state. Completion of the required continuing education activities must be independently verified by an official source other than the licensee. RENEWAL PROCEDURES Pharmacy licenses are renewed every 2 years by June 30. Although a 60-day late renewal period is allowed, the 30 or 15 hour continuing education requirement must be completed by June 30. Submission of the renewal application form certifies that the requirements are met. If the renewal requirements have not been completed, the renewal application should not be submitted. If a waiver is necessary, an application should be made after the licensee receives the renewal application in early May, but before the license expires on June 30. Licensees who have not been granted waivers should allow their licenses to expire. Application for relicensure may be made upon completion of the 30-hour requirement within the 2-year period immediately preceding the date of the application for relicensure if license has been expired for no more than 3 years. Information, forms and instructions for obtaining board approval can be obtained from the Continuing Education Section of the   Department of Community Health' Bureau of Health Professions. CONTINUING EDUCATION WAIVERS The Michigan Public Health Code authorizes the Board of Pharmacy to waive the continuing education requirements for a license renewal applicant if, upon written application, the board finds the failure of the licensee to attend the required boardapproved courses or programs was due to the licensee's disability, military service, absence from the continental United States, or a circumstance beyond the control of the licensee which the board considers good and sufficient. Pursuant to this authority, the board has promulgated guidelines that set forth the policy the board will follow in granting a waiver. The guidelines provide for the following: DISABILITY: The licensee's disability shall have been temporary in nature and the licensee's physician shall attest on the application that the disability no longer prevents the licensee from attending educational programs and engaging in the practice of Pharmacy without limitation. MILITARY SERVICE: The licensee shall have been practicing Pharmacy while in active service of the United States, shall have been licensed at the time of induction or entering into service, and shall have requested that his or her license be placed in military status to continue in effect without payment of the license renewal fee pursuant to Section 16196 of the Public Health Code.  ABSENCE FROM THE UNITED STATES: The licensee shall establish that board-approved educational programs were not available within a reasonable distance from which the licensee was located and the licensee shall provide evidence of attendance at educational programs that substantially meet the requirements for approval by the board. OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND LICENSEE'S CONTROL: For circumstances, other than disability, military service, or absence from the continental United States, the licensee shall submit compelling evidence that the circumstances were good and sufficient for a waiver of the requirements. If the board finds that any of the conditions for waiving the requirements have been met, the number of hours waived shall be proportional to the length of time the licensee was temporarily disabled, in active military service, outside the continental United States, or involved in circumstances beyond the licensee's control. The board will not waive the requirements prospectively, nor will the requirements be waived for a licensee whose circumstances changed in time to reasonably allow the licensee to complete all or part of the requirements before license renewal. To summarize: * Each pharmacists who was originally licensed in Michigan more than 1 year but less than 2 years before the renewal date shall have accumulated  15 hours of continuing Each Pharmacist who license for a full two years application for renewal is complete 30 hours of education in courses or approved by the board. *  education. held their before the required to continuing programs  Submission of the renewal application and fee is considered a statement that the CE requirement has been met.

The Maryland Board of Pharmacy sets standards that ensure safety and quality health care for the citizens of Maryland.  M  Maryland Board of Pharmacy 4201 Patterson Ave. Baltimore MD 21215-2299 410-764-4755 www.mdbop.org  aryland pharmacy law requires the Board to notify all Maryland pharmacists when the terms of Board of Pharmacy members will expire so that eligible pharmacists have an opportunity to seek a Board appointment. The Board of Pharmacy is comprised of 10 pharmacists and two consumer members that are appointed by the Governor. A Board member may serve a total of two, consecutive, four-year terms. The terms are staggered so that three four-year terms expire each year. Maryland law designates specific categories of representation for the 12 Board seats: Two Acute Care Hospital Pharmacists - usually selected from a list submitted by Maryland Society of Health-System Pharmacists; Two Independent Pharmacists - usually selected from a lists submitted by the Maryland Pharmacist Association and the Maryland Pharmaceutical Society; Two Chain Store Pharmacists - usually selected from a lists submitted by the Maryland Pharmacist Association and the Maryland Pharmaceutical Society; One Home Care Infusion Pharmacist - usually selected from a lists submitted by the Maryland Pharmacist Association and the Maryland Pharmaceutical Society; One Long Term Care Pharmacist - usually selected from a lists submitted by the Maryland Chapter of the American Society of Consultant Pharmacists; Two At Large Pharmacists - usually selected from a list of all interested pharmacists who have submitted their names to the Maryland Pharmacist Association; and Two Non-pharmacist Consumers - appointed to the Board with advice of the secretary and the consent of the senate. Designated Board seats that will be open for nominations in 2002 are one (1) Home Care Infusion Seat, one (1) Independent Seat, and one (1) Consumer seat. Currently, the appointees holding the pharmacist seats are eligible for reappointment in 2002.

(www.mdbop.org).  H  appy New Year! The past year and quarter has been filled with Board activities of which many are discussed in this issue. One very important event was the completion and receipt of the Board's Sunset Review. A Sunset Review is performed on most of the state health boards and commissions every ten years to determine if they should be re-authorized. That's right, the Board would have actually terminated on July 1, 2003, had the evaluation determined there was not a continued need for regulation of pharmacy in Maryland! Fortunately, the State Department of Legislative Services found the Board to be on the right track in terms of its operations and the manner in which it has addressed issues over the past ten years and recommended that it continue to function ~~ at least through July 1, 2013. The Board initiated two new task forces. The Bio-Terrorism Task Force was appointed to address pharmacy's roles in state emergency preparedness. The group was formed following the September 11th terrorist attack to ensure that Maryland pharmacists are not only prepared, but also equipped to meet a state emergency. Over four hundred pharmacists responded to the Board's request for volunteers in case of a state emergency. THANK YOU! It's not too late to send in the volunteer response form. We still need more volunteers. The second task force, the Shortage of Pharmacists Workgroup, held its initial meeting on December 3rd. Its assignment is to identify the magnitude of the pharmacist shortage in Maryland and develop methods to address related issues. The Medication Errors Task Force presented its final report to a joint legislative committee in November. Special thanks to Bruce Gordon who voluntarily facilitated Task Force deliberations for close to two years. Board staff persons, James Slade and Michelle Andoll are to be commended for their work in preparing the report that was very well received in Annapolis. The Joint Committee expressed pleasure with the presentation because the Task Force presented solid recommendations that could be implemented. Board member, Jeanne Furman also presented an overview of the Medication Errors Task Force Report at the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy's (NABP) District II meeting in early November. Over the last quarter, the Board and/or staff also participated in the NABP Executive Officers Training, the Citizens Advocacy Center's 2001 Annual Meeting, an Invitational Conference on Patient Safety sponsored by the University of Maryland Pharmacy School and Maryland Office of Health Care Quality, the Council of Boards and several other collaborative meeting that were germane to issues that the Board is presently addressing. Board Staff also reviewed several online licensing systems and I am pleased to report that the Board is close to testing an on-line system provided through NABP, with augmentation (necessary to ensure security, appropriate data collection, and a user-friendly system) through one or more additional contracts. In addition to the regularly featured information in this issue, is the Board's proposal to increase user fees. Increases are proposed to continue to meet Board operational costs and enhance services. continued on page 6  Mercy Medical Center Mercy Medical Center celebrated Pharmacy Week by having pharmacists and pharmacy students host a booth in the Main Lobby. The display highlighted the important role of the hospital pharmacist in the delivery of quality care in the institutional setting as well as describing steps patients and caregivers can take to ensure the safe and appropriate use of their medications.

The Institute of Medicine (IOMJ) published a report in December 1999 titled ""To Err is Human,"" which indicated that 44,000 to 98,000 Americans die of medical errors each year in hospitals. Medication errors alone are estimated to account for more than 7,000 deaths annually. The number may even be greater when including other health care establishments such as retail pharmacies, nursing homes, clinics, physician offices, and other ambulatory settings. The National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention (NCCMERP) defines a medication error as ""any preventable  event that may cause or lead to inappropriate medication use or patient harm while the medication is in the control of the healthcare professional, patient, or consumer."" Medication errors can occur anywhere in the medication delivery system including prescribing, transcribing, dispensing, administering, and monitoring the medical products. Often, similar strengths, similar sounding/ looking names, and similar labeling/packaging contribute to medication errors that occur in the medication delivery system. Changes to the design, the name, or labeling/packaging of the product can prevent medication errors. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) encourages the reporting of medication errors  to the agency so they can evaluate errors related to the naming, labeling, and/or packaging of drug products. The FDA receives reports of potential and actual medication errors through it s voluntary and confidential Medical Products Reporting Program (MedWatch), pharmaceutical manufacturers, and through the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Practioners' Reporting Network (operated in conjunction with the Institute for Safe Medication Practices). MedWatch is designed to receive reports from patients, consumers, and health care professionals concerning adverse events and problems associated with medical products such as prescription and nonprescription drugs, biologics, medical devices, and special  nutritional products that are regulated by the FDA. Product problems including product performance, quality, or safety on any medication or device (including medication errors) can be reported to MedWatch by mail using the postage-paid MedWatch form at http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/safety/350.pdf; by phone at 1-800-FDA-1088; by fax at 1-800-FDA-0178; or via the internet at http://www.fda.gov/ medwatch/. Consult the Maryland Board of Pharmacy if you have any questions about what is permissible. This is an excerpt from NAPB's article ""Medication Errors and the FDA,"" October 2001. Submitted by Jerry Phillips, David Diwa, Jennifer Fan, Hye-Joo Kim, and Alina Mahmud from the US Food and Drug Administration.  Earn a Degree with CE  T  he University of Maryland School of Pharmacy is accepting applications for the Nontraditional PharmD (NTPD) Pathway for Fall 2002 admission. The NTPD Pathway is a thirty-credit program for licensed pharmacists who already have a BS in pharmacy to earn the Doctor of Pharmacy degree. The goal of the program is to equip pharmacists to provide exemplary pharmaceutical care to improve the health and well-being of their patients. Maryland pharmacists can take advantage of in-state tuition rates. Many companies and institutions cover some of the tuition for their pharmacists. The program, which includes twelve required courses and five credits of electives, can be accomplished in three years.  Through the Prior Learning Assessment elective, students may earn academic credit for documented non-sponsored learning. Students may adjust their course load, as long as they enroll in a course each fall and spring semester. The NTPD program is designed for practicing pharmacists and does not require a leave of absence from work. Courses are offered at the University of Maryland campus in downtown Baltimore, and select course content may be offered via the internet and through distance education facilities elsewhere in Maryland. For more information, please access the website at www.pharmacy.umaryland.edu/nontradpharmd or call the director, Cynthia Boyle, at 410-706-1495.  New Website Format Unveiled The Board's new website format will go into effect on January 15th. Come visit the site to see all of our new features.  http://www.mdbop.org  3   Regulations Updates Fees Emergency regulations are anticipated to become effective on February 1, 2002, which will increase certain fees relating to pharmacists. Effective July 1, 2002, standard regulations are expected to become effective. The Board has decreased fees in the past, but proposes to increase them to maintain Board operations. (See article in this issue) things, that unlicensed personnel maintain proper sanitation, hygiene, biohazard precautions, and infection control while performing tasks in the prescription process. The effective date of adoption of the amendments was December 10, 2001. The purpose of the proposed regulations is to address pharmacies' and pharmacists' responsibilities when prescription medications are sent to patients via the United States Postal Service, common carrier, or other delivery system, in order to protect the public health. were published for comment in the Maryland Register. The proposed chapter will define the parameters under which a permit holder may allow the use of an automated medication system for the distribution of medication.  Record of Drug Inventory Acquisition Effective September 17, 2001, pharmacy permit holders that acquire drug inventory from any source must maintain certain minimum records relating to the acquisition, including ""the name and principal address of the source of the drugs...the identity and quantity of the drugs received; and ...the date the drugs were received."" The new regulations also require the pharmacy permit holder to produce the drug inventory acquisition records within 72 hours of a request from a governmental entity. An exception from the record-keeping requirement for drugs that are replaced within 7 days is established.  Patient Safety Improvement Proposed regulations relating to patient safety improvement were published in the November 16, 2001 Maryland Register. This new chapter is intended to address medication errors. The proposed chapter will address error reduction in three ways. Pharmacy permit holders will be required to provide patients with certain information. Pharmacy permit holders will be required to ensure that pharmacy staff receives annual training relating to medication errors. Finally, pharmacy permit holders will be required to maintain quality assurance programs.  Compelling Public Purpose It is expected that the Board's Disclosure for Compelling Public Purpose regulations will become effective shortly. Please track these regulations in the Maryland Register. This proposed chapter will allow the Board, upon finding that there is a compelling public purpose, to disclose certification, licensing or investigative information to certain entities, regardless of whether there is a request for the information.  Pharmacist Code of Conduct Effective November 12, 2001, the Pharmacist Code of Conduct was amended to require pharmacists to ""maintain proper sanitation, hygiene, biohazard precautions, and infection control when performing tasks in the prescription process."" COMAR 10.34.10.01. This regulation was also amended to make unprofessional conduct grounds for discipline.  HB 418 (Impoundment Regulations) The Board is developing regulations that are required by House Bill 418, Drugs and Prescription Records- Impounding and Disposing, which was passed during the 2001 Maryland legislative session.  Standard of Practice for Unlicensed Personnel Existing regulations, entitled Standard of Practice for Unlicensed Personnel, were amended to require that permit holders ensure, among other  Delivery of Prescriptions The Board's Delivery of Prescriptions regulations became effective December 10, 2001.  Automated Medication Systems Proposed regulations relating to automated medication systems  Sanitation  E  ffective June 1, 2001, COMAR 10.34.10 Pharmacist Code of Conduct, was amended to include the following language: ""A pharmacist shall maintain proper sanitation, hygiene, biohazard precautions, and infection control when performing tasks in the prescription process."" In part, this amendment was prompted by several complaints filed with the Board alleging that a pharmacist may have failed to engage in proper hygiene and cleanliness while 4  preparing prescriptions. The regulation is intended to make clear the Board's expectation that pharmacists will prepare and dispense medications only under appropriate sanitary conditions and not engage in any activity that would compromise or question the integrity of medications provided to the patient. The regulation is also intended to prohibit any activity that may result in exposure to a patient or pharmacy personnel to bio-hazardous conditions.  For instance, it was brought to the Board's attention that some nuclear pharmacies may be using contaminated lead containers to transport radiopharmaceuticals from the pharmacy to the patient. Without the use of a disposable plastic liner, the lead container may become contaminated with biological waste when the container is used to return the radioactive syringe and blood contaminated administration materials to the pharmacy. Reuse of a container contaminated with  infectious waste is one example of a lapse in infection control that may be a violation of this regulation. As health care professionals, pharmacists must be aware of the prevailing standards of sanitation, hygiene, biohazard precautions, and infection control related to their practice. Failure to adhere to these standards may constitute grounds for disciplinary action under this regulation.  4   Professional Practice Corner How to Stop Drug Diversion and Protect Your Pharmacy This guide summarizes tips from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and other sources designed to ensure that prescription drugs continue to be available where medically indicated, while preventing their diversion into the illicit market. As the DEA states, it is not their role ""to reduce or deny the use of controlled substances where medically indicated."" Nevertheless, according to the DEA, the pharmacist has a personal responsibility to protect his/her practice from becoming an easy target for drug diversion. ""The dispensing pharmacists must maintain constant vigilance against forged or altered prescriptions.""  Board Proposes Increasing Licensing and Permit Fees  M  ost Board licensees and permit holders benefited in 1997 when the Board of Pharmacy reduced fees. Since that time, the Board has used surplus funds to supplement total budgeted expenditures (which have exceeded actual Board income up to $300,000 annually). At the end of the current fiscal year (June 20, 2002), the Board anticipates having depleted its surplus to a point that it would face a deficit if fees were not increased. Therefore, the Board approved increases in certain fees at its October 2001 public meeting in order to meet FY 2003 and subsequent projected budgets over the next five years. LaVerne Naesea, Executive Director stated, ""in addition to anticipated increases in the Board's general operating expenses (e.g., strategic planning, the new web site, E-Gov on-line licensing, and additional staff), the Board experienced unanticipated increases related to indirect costs, such as increased rent, attorney fees, and other administrative assessments. The Board carefully weighed proposed increases to insure that they are limited to meeting projected expenditures over the next five years."" Emergency regulations have been proposed to increase certain fees, effective February 1, 2002. Proposed increases are as follows: Pharmacists New (Exam) Renewal Reciprocity Pharmacies New Renewal Late Other Establishments Distributors New Distributors Renew Distributors Late Manufacturers New Manufacturers Renew Manufacturers Late Current $ 50.00 $ 95.00 $200.00 $150.00 $150.00 $ 75.00 $250.00 $250.00 $ 75.00 $300.00 $250.00 $ 75.00 New $100.00 $150.00 $250.00 $300.00 $250.00 $150.00 $500.00 $500.00 $150.00 $500.00 $500.00 $150.00  Types of Fraudulent Prescriptions Diverter steals prescription pads from doctor's offices and writes prescriptions for fictitious patients. Diverter alters a prescription to obtain larger quantities of drugs; for example, diverter changes the number 10 to become 40, 70 or 100. Diverter changes telephone number on legitimate pads so an accomplice can ""verify"" the fraudulent prescription when you call. Diverter calls in prescription and vies his/her own telephone number for the call back confirmation. Diverter uses computer and/or copier to create prescription pads for nonexistent doctors or to copy legitimate doctors' prescriptions. Diverter ""rinses"" the prescription blank with acetone (nail polish remover) to remove the original writing for a non-controlled substance (e.g., an antibiotic) and writes in a controlled substance. Presented as an educational service by Purdue Pharma L.P. More to come in April's issue.  (in addition to other examination fees) (in addition to MHCC fee of $34.00)  When approved, graduating students, licensees and permit holders will receive notice of the increases with their next new/renewal application packets.  New Information on Website Regarding Non-Renewed Pharmacists At the end of each month, those pharmacists who have not renewed prior to the expiration of their licenses will be listed on the website. This new initiative is intended to help establishments insure that their employees are properly credentialed to practice pharmacy in Maryland. Pharmacists are required to renew their licenses every two years by the end of their birth month.  Legislative Updates Drug Therapy Management and Cooperative Procedures: The Board of Pharmacy sponsored a work group to resolve issues raised by Senate Bill 772 (2001 Legislative Session), Drug Therapy Management and Cooperative Procedures. It is expected that a bill will be introduced during the 2002 Maryland legislative session relating to drug therapy management, which will reflect the discussions of the work group.  Revisions of Regulations Pertaining to Late Renewals and Reinstatement The Board's Licensing Committee is currently reviewing 12-308 310 and Regulation 10.34.13 for possible changes in renewal and reinstatement requirements. Most or all of the changes being considered are not substantive, but will be made to clarify certain related requirements. Check the Board's website and newsletter, as well as the Maryland Register for updates and future proposed changes.  5   FAQs In day-to-day pharmacy practice, unusual situations sometime occur, generating questions. So to help our licensees, ""Frequently Asked Questions"" will be featured in each issue of the Board's newsletter. If you have a question you would like to see answered in this column, please fax your question to 410-358-6207 or e-mail to Joan Lawrence at jlawrence@dhmh.state.md.us. Compliance Q1. May unlicensed pharmacy personnel receive refill authorizations from the prescriber? The standards of practice for unlicensed personnel are found at COMAR 10.34.21. This regulation delineates tasks that may be performed by unlicensed pharmacy staff. It also establishes certain other requirements concerning the supervision and utilization of unlicensed pharmacy staff. Unlicensed pharmacy staff that have been properly trained may receive refill authorizations from the prescriber provided that the prescription is NOT for a controlled dangerous substance, and no change is made in the original prescription order other than the number of refills allowed. Q2. Who may legally enter the pharmacy prescription area when the pharmacy is closed? Except in an emergency as defined by law, such as fire or flood, an individual may not be in the prescription area unless a pharmacist is immediately available on the premises to provide pharmacy services. COMAR 10.34.05. This applies to all pharmacy practice settings, including institutional and inpatient. 1. Contact the Board for a reinstatement application. 2. Complete an oral English exam. 3. Take the Multi-state Jurisprudence Exam (MPJE). 4. Show proof of pharmacy experience for the past two (2) years. 5. Complete and submit a reinstatement application to the Board. Q2. I have not received my pharmacist license renewal application yet and I usually renew this month. Will you send a duplicate renewal form to me? Following the initial renewal period, pharmacists' licenses expire every two years, at the end of their birth month. The Board mails pharmacist renewal applications sixty days prior to when the current license will expire. If you think it is time for your license to be renewed, first check the expiration date on your current license. Contact the Board for a duplicate application only if your license is due to expire within seven weeks and you have not received a renewal application packet from the Board. Pharmacists should get in the habit of periodically checking their licenses to ensure that they have not forgotten to renew. Remember, when engaged in pharmacy practice, it is the responsibility of the pharmacist to ensure she/he is properly licensed at all times.  Disciplinary Actions Maria Johnson, (#08123) Effective September 12, 2001, license to practice pharmacy is placed on probation, a reprimand issued and a monetary penalty assessed.

John Riley, (#09173) Effective October 31, 2001, license to practice pharmacy is reinstated and placed on probation  Executive Director's Report (continued from Page 2) The Board has come a long way in defining how it can best protect and educate consumers. It has shared the many initiatives undertaken to support and serve licensees and permit holders better while meeting this mission. The proposed increases are absolutely necessary and reasonable when compared to other states' fees. A list of the proposed increases, expected to become effective February 2002, is provided inside this issue.

This is a highly prestigious honor, for which I would not have been selected without the good fortune of working with wonderful staff at the Board and throughout my state career and a highly proactive and supportive Board of Pharmacy.  Licensing Q1. If my license lapses, what is the procedure to reactivate my license? You would need to reinstate your license. To reinstate, the following process must be followed: 6   Fast Bytes Bio-terrorism CE In order to help pharmacists respond to questions from patients about the threat of bioterrorist agents, the Professional Education Services Group has developed a two-hour CE program that will address issues such as recognizing signs and symptoms of various bio-terrorist agents, initiating appropriate therapy, and key points to discuss when counseling patients. The CE is available as an Internet PowerPoint presentation, through www.biologicalterrorismmeded.com, and costs $25.00. National Community Pharmacist Association (NCPA) members enter the code: BA2697 when prompted on the website to receive the discounted rate of $18.00.  Board Involved in Bioterrorism Readiness The Board would like to thank the pharmacists and unlicensed personnel who have answered the call for volunteers to date. With this information, the State will be able to rapidly contact pharmacists who are willing to help in specified areas of the State. Plans are being made which will allow pharmacists to provide required counseling, to rapidly dispense medication to persons who can take the drug of choice, and to have appropriate personnel assess those with special needs. The Board of Pharmacy members, and other pharmacists are involved in on-going meetings at several levels in the State  to coordinate plans for the total effort. The Maryland Board of Pharmacy is represented by Stanton G. Ades, President, on the Bio-terrorism Task Force formed by the Secretary of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH). Also, represented on the Task Force are Bart Regan and Phil Cogan as technical advisors. The Board voted to create a short-term workgroup to develop a plan for mass distribution of medications and inoculations of Maryland citizens in the event of a bioterrorist attack or other catastrophic events requiring largescale pharmacists assistance. President, Ades and volunteer pharmacist Bart Ryan co-chair  this committee, which members include, Commissioners Love, Rubin, Schneider and Balch and volunteer pharmacist Phil Cogan. One key concern of this group is to ensure that the efforts of all of the groups working on emergency plans are coordinated. The Board of Pharmacy website (http://www.mdbop.org/alert/ind ex.htm) has links to programs which can help you to better understand the potential biologic threats and to help allay concerns of patients. The Board web site also has the volunteer forms that can be processed online or downloaded and fax to the Board. Go to www.mdbop.org.  HIV/AIDS Seminar - A Special Thanks from the Maryland Board of Pharmacy  L  ast Spring, the Maryland Board of Pharmacy performed a sample survey of pharmacists who called into the office, to determine if they would be interested in receiving training on HIV/AIDS related issues. A high majority of respondents indicated that they would. In a first effort of its kind, the Board solicited assistance from Associated Black Charities' Greater Baltimore HIV Health Services Planning Council and the Maryland Pharmacists Association (MPhA). These two organizations forged a partnership to present an exciting and successful continuing education (CE) seminar on ""HIV/AIDS Therapy, Drug Interaction and Adherence: A Guide for Pharmacists,"" on November 7, 2001, at The Marriott Waterfront, Baltimore City, Maryland. Seating was limited and the event was over-subscribed by more than 230 pharmacists from the Maryland and Washington DC areas. Attendees at the event, which was strongly endorsed by the Board, were served cocktails while they visited exhibit booths. During the serving of dinner, Board President Stanton G. Ades, welcomed guests and introduced guest speaker Peter Beilenson, M.D., MPH, Commissioner of Health, Baltimore City Health Department. Dr. Beilenson provided information about a new pilot that the Baltimore City Department of Health will introduce using teams of physicians, pharmacists and other health professionals to track patients in the community. Following Dr. Beilenson, the continuing education seminar was presented by three dynamic speakers: Beulah Perdue Sabundayo, Pharm.D, MPH, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,  who spoke on the technical aspects and trends of drug therapy regimens; Michelle Forrest-Smith, Pharm.D, Curascript Pharmacy, Johns Hopkins Hospital who discussed various interactions and problems related to the numerous medications that HIV/AIDS patients may be prescribed; and Shivaun A. Celano, Pharm. D., MBA, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, who provided valuable information about patients' adherence to treatment regimens, methods for tracking and the consequences of non-adherence. Chief supporters of the event included Associated Black Charities (ABC), the Maryland Pharmacists Association (MPhA), Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and the Pennsylvania Mid-Atlantic AIDS Education and Training Center. The Board thanks all of those who participated in making this event a success and especially acknowledges Associated Black Charities (ABC), Maryland Pharmacists Association (MPhA), Board Members, Barbara Faltz-Jackson (Public Relations Chairperson) Jeanne Furman, Wayne Dyke, Joan Lawrence (Public Education Officer), and Board Executive Secretary, Angela Hamlin for their support and promotion of this event. The Board may endorse future seminars that interest pharmacists.

The Board now returned to its open session. The Board next turned its attention to the performance of candidates for licensure by examination that have now completed all parts of the January 2003 Board Examination. For Full Board Examination candidates, the Board determined that, in grading the examinations, the NAPLEX portion of the exam would be weighted at 65% of the total, the Board's Practical Examination weighted at 20% of the total, the Multistate Pharmacy Jurisprudence Examination weighted at 15% of the total, and that the minimum passing score on each of those parts, as well as the minimum overall score, would be 75. With the passing level thus established, Mr. Vern Kassekert moved and Mr. Gary Schneider seconded that the following candidates be granted licensure as pharmacists: NAME Joy R. Bhardwaj Shawn M.

NAME Scott Peter Knishka Lida R. Etemad Christina Marie Sorrentino  Mr. Holmstrom next presented the Board with a list of Continuing Education Programs submitted to and reviewed by the Continuing Education Advisory Task Force between the dates of November 12, 2002 and January 21, 2003, and between the dates of January 21, 2003 and February 11, 2003. After reviewing the list of programs submitted to and reviewed by the Continuing Education Advisory Task Force, Ms. Carol Peterson moved and Mr. Vern Kassekert seconded that those programs recommended for approval be so approved and that those programs for which denial of approval was recommended be denied. The motion passed. Mr. Holmstrom next presented the Board with information relating to issues of interest to the Rules/Legislation Committee. The first such issue involved requests being received by individual pharmacists to compound certain drugs that are no longer available commercially, and the extent to which pharmacists can prepare and distribute those products as pharmacies rather than becoming licensed as drug manufacturers. No formal action was taken by the Board regarding this issue. The second item discussed by the Board relating to Rules/Legislation was the Governor's recommendation regarding the Board's biennial budget submission for the FY 2004-2005 biennium. No formal action was taken by the Board on this issue. Mr. Holmstrom next presented the Board with the report of the Variance Committee. Mr. Holmstrom also presented the Board with additional information regarding a variance request from Care Alliance Pharmacy relating to the Omnicell Dispensing Unit. After discussing the Variance Committee report and the additional information received from Care Alliance Pharmacy, Mr. Vern Kassekert moved and Mr. Tom Dickson seconded that the Care Alliance Pharmacy request relating to the automated medication dispensing system be approved for a one-year period of time and, with that amendment, the Variance Committee report be adopted. The motion passed. Mr. Holmstrom next presented the Board with a letter from Mr. John Christopher Stepaniuk, a pharmacist from Canada, who is applying to sit for the Board exam in Minnesota this coming June. Mr. Stepaniuk is requesting that the Board consider his experience as a pharmacist in Canada as meeting the Board's 1,600-hour internship requirement. After reviewing the information provided by Mr. Stepaniuk, Mr. Vern Kassekert moved and Mr. Gary Schneider seconded that the Board accept Mr. Stepaniuk's experience as a pharmacist in Canada as meeting the entire 1,600-hour internship requirement for Minnesota. The motion passed.   MINNESOTA BOARD OF PHARMACY - 753 Meeting, February 26, 2003 Page 5 Mr. Holmstrom next presented the Board with a letter from Mr. Harold Sadoff, who is seeking to reactivate his license to practice pharmacy. Mr. Sadoff is proposing that he be required to complete 75 hours of continuing education and to take and successfully pass the Multistate Pharmacy Jurisprudence Examination in order to reinstate his license to practice, Mr. Vern Kassekert moved and Ms. Carol Peterson seconded that the Board accept this proposal by Mr. Sadoff. The motion passed. Mr. Holmstrom next presented the Board with a letter from Mr. Ronald M. Rogers, who currently resides in Washington state and is licensed and in good standing in North Dakota and Washington and is licensed in Minnesota as an emeritus status pharmacist. Mr. Rogers is now requesting that the Board allow him to reactivate his emeritus status license and is requesting guidance from the Board on how he should proceed. After reviewing the fact that Mr. Rogers originally reciprocated to Minnesota based on a license to practice pharmacy in North Dakota, and since his North Dakota license is still active and in good standing, Mr. Rogers could again reciprocate to Minnesota or the Board determined that Mr. Rogers emeritus status license could be converted back to active status through the payment of back fees, providing evidence of being current on continuing education, and successful completion of the Multistate Pharmacy Jurisprudence Examination. The Board then proceeded to direct Mr. Holmstrom to provide these two options to Mr. Rogers. There being no further business to come before the Board at this time, President Johnson adjourned the meeting at approximately 2:00 p.m.  _______________________________ PRESIDENT ___________________________________ EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

COURSE OF PROCEEDINGS On October 29,2001 Dean Sams filed a Petition for Waiver on behalf of NCS Healthcare requesting a waiver of 657 IAC 6.8, which requires pharmacies to keep inventory and other records at the location where the pharmacy is licensed for `atleast two years. The Board considered the Petition for Waiver at its January 23,2002 meeting.  2.  ALLEGED FACTS 3.  In its Petition, NCS Healthcare alleges: ""We would like to keep records off site at a storage facility until the required amount of time expired at which time the records would then be destroyed . . ."" Petition Para. 4. NCS further asserts: ""This would allow us to better comply with IAC Chapter 6, Rule 6.5(2). We would be better able to maintain orderliness in the Pharmacy if older patient records and wholesale receiving records were stored off the Pharmacy premises."" Petition Para. 5. SUMMARY OF LAW  4.  Iowa Code chapter 155A grants authority regarding the licensing of Iowa Code sections 155A.13, 155A.13A, pharmaciesto the Board. and 155A.15. 657 IAC 6.8 provides:  5.   -2-  Every inventory or other record required to be kept under Iowa Code chapters 124 and 155A or 657--Chapter 6 shall be kept at the licensed location of the phannacy and be available for inspection and copying by the board or its representative for at least two years fi-om the date of the inventory or record except as otherwise required in this rule. Controlled substance records shall be maintained in a readily retrievable manner in accordance with federal requirements. Those requirements, in summary, are as follows: [11/12/97] 6.8(1) Controlled substance records shall be maintained in a manner to establish receipt and distribution of all controlled substances; [ 11/12/97] 6.8(2) Records of controlled substances in Schedule I1 shall be maintained separately fi-om records of controlled substances in Schedules III, IV,and V and all other records; [11/12/97] 6.8(3) A Schedule V nonprescription registry book shall be maintained in accordance with 657--subrule 10.13(13). [11/12/97] 6.8(4) Invoices involving the distribution of Schedule 111, IV,or V controlled substances to another pharmacy or practitioner must show the actual date of distribution; the name, strength, and quantity of controlled substances distributed; the name, address, and DEA registration number of the distributing pharmacy and of the practitioner or pharmacy receiving the controlled substances; [11/12/97] 6.8(5) Copy 1 of DEA order form 222, furnished by the pharmacy or practitioner to whom Schedule II controlled substances are distributed, shall be maintained by the distributing pharmacy and shall show the quantity of controlled substances distributed and the actual date of distribution; 6.8(6) Copy 3 of DEA order form 222 shall be properly dated, initialed, and filed and shall include all copies of each unaccepted or defective order form and any attached statements ox other documents; [11/12/97] 6.8(7) If controlled substances, prescription drugs, or nonprescription drug items are listed on the same record, the controlled substances shall be asterisked, red-lined, or in some other manner readily identifiable fi-om all other items appearing on the records; [ 11/12/97] 6.8(8) Suppliers' invoices of prescription drugs and controlled substances shall clearly record the actual date of receipt by the pharmacist or other responsible individual; [11/12/97] 6.8(9) Suppliers' credit memos for controlled substances and prescription drugs shall be maintained; [11/12/97] 6.8(10) A biennial inventory of controlled substances shall be maintained for a minimum of four years from the date of the inventory; [ 11/12/97]   -3-  6.8(11) Reports of theft or significant loss of controlled substances shall be maintained; [11/12/97] 6.8(12) Reports of surrender or destruction of controlled substances shall be maintained. [11/12/97] 6.8(13) Records, except when specifically required to be maintained in original or hard-copy form, may be maintained in an alternative data retention system, such as a data processing system or direct imaging system provided: a. The records maintained in the alternative system contain all of the information required on the manual record; and b. The data processing system is capable of producing a hard copy of the record upon the request of the board, its representative, or other authorized local, state, or federal law enforcement or regulatory agencies. [11/12/97] 6. The Board may in its sole discretion issue an order waiving in whole or in part the requirements of a rule if the Board finds, based upon clear and convincing evidence, all of the following: a. b. c. d. The application of the rule would pose an undue hardship on the person for whom the waiver is requested; The waiver from the requirements of the rule in the specific case would not prejudice the substantial legal rights of any person; The provisions of the rule subject to the petition for a waiver are not specifically mandated by statute or another provision of law; and Substantially equal protection of public health, safety, and welfare will be afforded by a means other than that prescribed in the particular rule for which the waiver is requested.  657 IAC 34.4. 7. The Board's rules provide that ""the burden of persuasion rests with the petitioner to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the Board should exercise its discretion to grant a waiver from a rule."" 657 IAC 34.4. CRITERIA FOR WAIVER  The application of the rule would create an undue hardship on the person for whom the waiver is requested:  8.  According to the facts as presented by NCH Healthcare, it would be better able to comply with the Board's requirements to maintain a clean and orderly pharmacy if it does not have to maintain all of the required records on site. In light of these circumstances, requiring NCS Healthcare to   -4-  maintain all relevant records on site for 2 years would create an undue hardship on the hospital. The waiver from the requirements of the rule in the specific case would not preiudice the substantial legal right s of any person:  9.  Because the circumstances supporting granting this waiver are individualized in nature, the Board's decision to grant the waiver in this case would not prejudice the substantial legal rights of any other person.  The provisions of the rule subiect to the petition for waiver are not specifically mandated bv another provision of law: 10.  The Code vests the Board with discretion to determine the standards for pharmacies. $ee Iowa Code sections 155A.7 & 155A.12. Pursuant to this discretion, the Board has promulgated rules and standards for pharmacies. $ee 657 IAC chapter 6. Except as provided below, the rules and standards that NCH Healthcare requests a waiver for, however, are not specifically mandated by statute or other provisions of law and accordingly may be waived by the Board.  Substantially equal protection of public health, safety, and welfare will be afforded bv a means other than that prescribed in the particular rule for which the waiver is requested: 11. The public health, safety, and welfare will not be compromised or otherwise placed at risk as a result of the Board's granting a wavier in this case. Pursuant to the limitations place on the waiver, NCS Healthcare will be required to be able to access its records within 48 hours. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED:  12.  The requirement of 657 IAC 6.8 that requires pharmacies to maintain all of the relevant records at the pharmacy's licensed location for a period of two years is waived for NCS Healthcare subject to the following limitations: (1) NCS Healthcare shall keep all relevant records on site at its licensed location for six months; (2) NCS Healthcare shall maintain any and all records that the United States Drug Enforcement Agency requires to be kept on site at its licensed location for the entire length of time required by the DEA; (3) NCS Healthcare must document the location of any records stored off-site pursuant to this waiver and ensure the records' security; (4) NCS Healthcare must be able to retrieve any records stored off site within 48 hours. The waiver is valid for two years from the date this order is signed. If NCS Healthcare wishes to extend the waiver, it shall apply for a renewal of this waiver before the 2-year waiver period has expired.   -5-  Dated this  day of  2002.

COURSE OF PROCEEDINGS 1.  On November 30,2001, Alan Albert0 filed a Petition for Waiver on behalf of the Syncor International Corporation (Petitioner). The Petition for Waiver requested a waiver of 657 IAC 17.7(2). The Board considered the Petition for Waiver at its January 23,2002 meeting. ALLEGED FACTS  2.  3.  In its Petition, Syncor International Corporation alleges the following facts: The security of the wholesaling area to unauthorized entry by an individual or individuals is the intent of this rule. . . . I am requesting that we be exempt from the requirement to have an alarm system on our facility fkom the current date through 12-31-02. . . . We operate this facility as a licensed nuclear pharmacy. With this in mind, we do not allow unauthorized access to the facility by individuals without the consent and knowledge of the pharmacists present. Our wholesaling area consists of a refrigerator/freezer that have keyed locks on both compartments. For this reason, the wholesale drugs are adequately secured. Our building has doors that lock from the outside. This happens as the doors close upon exit. We do anticipate that we will move our entire pharmacy and wholesaling business sometime during 2002. On the new facility, an alarm system will be required. The financial burden of installing a system for only 7-12 months use is not something that would be beneficial to the business we operate. We feel that we have taken   -2-  adequate and appropriate steps to secure the wholesale drugs at the current time. SUMMARY OF LAW  4. 5.  Iowa Code chapter 155A grants authority regarding the licensing of wholesale drug distributors to the Board. See Iowa Code 155A.17. 657 IAC 17.7(2) provides that ""All facilities [for wholesale drug distribution] shall be equipped with an alarm system to deter entry after hours."" The Board may in its sole discretion issue an order waiving in whole or in part the requirements of a rule if the Board finds, based upon clear and convincing evidence, all of the following: a. b. c. d. The application of the rule would pose an undue hardship on the person for whom the waiver is requested; The waiver &om the requirements of the rule in the specific case would not prejudice the substantial legal rights of any person; The provisions of the rule subject to the petition for a waiver are not specificallymandated by statute or another provision of law; and Substantially equal protection of public health, safety, and welfare will be afforded by a means other than that prescribed in the particular rule for which the waiver is requested.  6.  657 IAC 34.4. 7. The Board's rules provide that ""the burden of persuasion rests with the petitioner to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the Board should exercise its discretion to grant a waiver from a rule."" 657 IAC 34.4. CRITERIA FOR WAIVER Whether the application of the rule would create an undue hardship on the person for whom the waiver is requested: 8.  The Petitioner alleges that the financial burden of installing an alarm system in its facility would not be in the best interest of the business because the Petitioner asserts that the business is considering relocating sometime during 2002. The Petitioner does not, however, provide any information regarding the cost of installing an alarm system that would comply with the rule, any information about whether the alarm system could be transferable, or evidence regarding the likelihood that the Petitioner will, in fact, relocate within the near kme.  2   -3-  Whether the waiver from the requirements of the rule in the specific case would preiudice the substantial legal rights of any person:  9.  The Petitioner does not address this element in its Petition for a waiver.  Whether thegrovisions of the rule subiect to the petition for waiver are specifically mandated by another provision of law: 10. The Iowa Code vests the Board with discretion to determine the standards for drug wholesalers. See Iowa Code sections 155A.17. Pursuant to this discretion, the Board has promulgated rules regarding security at wholesaling drug distribution facilities. The rule for which Syncor requests a waiver, however, is not specifically mandated by statute or other provisions of law and accordingly may be waived by the Board.  Whether substantially equal protection of public health, safety, and welfare will be afforded by a means other than that prescribed in the particular rule for which the waiver is requested: -  11.  The Petitioner has not provided sufficient information from which the Board can assess this element. The Board further notes that the rule 657 IAC 17.7(2) is not intended to address access to the facility during normal operating hours when pharmacists are on site. The rule seeks to prevent break-ins and other unauthorized entry into the wholesaling facility after hours. The system for security described by the Petitioner does not address this issue. The Board further notes that, as a nuclear pharmacy and wholesaler, the Petitioner's business raises security issues that do, in fact, have the potential to negatively impact public health, safety, and welfare if security at the facility is breached. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED:  12.  The Petitioner has not met its burden of persuading the Board that it should grant the requested waiver. The Petitioner has not provided evidence establishing the four criteria the Board must find to enable the Board to grant a waiver. The Board hrther notes that the Petitioner's request for a waiver is not in the best interest of protecting the public health, safety, and welfare. As a result, even if the Petitioner had provided additional information, the Board would have exercised its discretion against granting a waiver under these circumstances. For all of the foregoing reasons, the Petitioner's request for a waiver of 657 IAC 17.7(2) is hereby DENIED.  3   -4-  Dated this  day o  2002.  WTTHEW C.

COURSE OF PROCEEDINGS  1.  On January 1,2002, the Western Iowa Compounding Solutions (hereafter ""Western?) filed a Petition for Waiver requesting a waiver of 657 LAC 6.5(4), which requires general pharmacies to contain an area which is suitable for confidential patient counseling. The Board considered the Petition for Waiver at its January 12,2002 meeting. ALLEGED FACTS  2.  3.  In its Petition, Western alleges the following facts: Western Iowa Compounding Solutions is constructed within the building housing Maier Family Pharmacy (IA Pharmacy License No. 1) The Petition would be for a waiver allowing Western Iowa Compounding Solutions for as long as it occupies joint building to share the . . . counseling area of Maier Family Pharmacy. There would be unneeded costs and time involved in construction a new counseling area . - .. Because the new pharmacy is located within the same building as an existing pharmacy these assets already exist and patients can use them equally. (Petition for Waiver).  ...  1   SUMMARY OF LAW 4. Iowa Code chapter 155A grants authority regarding the licensing of pharmacies to the Board. See Iowa Code sections 155A.13, 155A.l3A, and 155A.15. 657 IAC 6.5(4) provides: A pharmacy shall contain an area which is suitable for confidential patient counseling. Such area shall: a. Be easily accessible to both patient and pharmacists and not allow patient access to prescription drugs; b. Be designed to maintain the confidentiality and privacy of the pharmacistlpatient communication. 6. The Board may in its sole discretion issue an order waiving in whole or in part the requirements of a rule if the Board finds, based upon clear and convincing evidence, all of the following: a. b. c. d. The application of the rule would pose an undue hardship on the person for whom the waiver is requested; The waiver f?om the requirements of the rule in the specific case would not prejudice the substantial legal rights of any person; The provisions of the rule subject to the petition for a waiver are not specifically mandated by statute or another provision of law; and Substantially equal protection of public health, safety, and welfare will be afforded by a means other than that prescribed in the particular rule for which the waiver is requested.  5.  657 IAC 34.4. 7.  The Board's rules provide that ""the burden of persuasion rests with the petitioner to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the Board should exercise its discretion to grant a waiver from a rule."" 657 IAC 34.4. CRITERIA FOR W m R  The application of the rule would create an undue hardship on the person for whom the waiver is requested: 8.  According to the facts presented by Western, the cost of purchasing and maintaining a duplicative counseling area is unnecessary and therefore would create an undue hardship under these circumstances.  2   The waiver from the requirements of the rule in the specific case would not preiudice the substantial legal right s of any person:  9.  Because the circumstances supporting granting this waiver are individualized in nature, the Board's decision to grant the waiver in this case would not prejudice the substantial legal rights of any other person.  The provisions of the rule subiect to the petition for waiver are not specifically mandated by another provision of law:  10.  The Code vests the Board with discretion to determine the standards for pharmacies. See Iowa Code sections 155A.13 & 155A.15. Pursuant to this discretion, the Board has promulgated rules and standards for pharmacies. See 657 IAC chapter 6. The rule and standard that Western requests a waiver for, however, is not specifically mandated by statute or other provisions of law and accordingly may be waived by the Board.  Substantially equal protection of public health, safetv, and welfare will be afforded by a means other than that prescribed in the particular rule for which the waiver is requested:  11.  The public health, safety, and welfare will not be compromised or otherwise place at risk as a result of the Board's granting a waiver in this case. The counseling area library at the licensed pharmacy in which the Petitioner's pharmacy is located will be readily accessible to Western and its patients. The Board regularly grants licenses under these types of circumstances. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED:  12.

The meeting was called to order by Chairperson Poston. Robert Parrado, R.Ph., Tampa   John Rimes, Assistant Attorney General   Deborah Loucks, Senior Attorney   Lucy Gee, Acting Executive Director   Garnet Keller, Regulatory Supervisor   Fritz Hayes, Caremark Pharmacy  Danielle Carroll, Prosecution Services Unit    ROLL CALL Rebecca Poston, R.Ph., Orlando Arnold Barad, R.Ph., Boynton Beach Helen Fong, R.Ph., Orlando James Powers, R.Ph., Tallahassee Gene Motley, St. Augustine Michael Stamitoles, R.Ph., Pensacola Gail Smith, Pharm. D., Tierra Verde  COURT REPORTER: Connie Butler, For The Record, 106 W. 5th Ave., Tallahassee, Fl, 32301 TAB 1 Dept. of Health vs. RxNetwork of South Florida, LLC. and Dept. of Health vs. Gwyneth Gordon, R.Ph.- Consideration of DRAFT Final Order  Mr. Rimes reminded Ms. Poston and Mr. Motley that they were recused from discussion of the case because they served on probable cause, however, Ms. Poston could serve as board chair. Mr. Rimes presented the draft final order and indicated that there were minor corrections to paragraph 24 and Footnote 1. The first sentence of Paragraph 24 was amended to read, ""The Board has reviewed the Department's motion to assess costs as provided in Section 456.072(4), Fla. Stat., the attachments to the motion, and the objections thereto, and has heard arguments of counsel."" Footnote 1 was corrected to delete FEC and insert ""Board."" Mr. Barad indicated the rule cites in paragraphs 15 and 16 should be 64B16-64.140 instead of 64B16-64.130. Ms. Fong expressed her concerns regarding paragraph 14. She felt it gave the impression that the board was satisfied with the determination of the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) concerning Ms. Gordon's responsibility as a prescription department manager, when, in fact, they did not. Minutes   Board of Pharmacy  General Board Meeting Teleconference   March 31, 2003  Page 1 of 9     Mr. Rimes explained that there are 2 matters: one has to do with the charging document and the charges against the prescription department manager, and the second is the board's acceptance of the ALJ's determination. The ALJ made the determination that the evidence was less than clear and convincing to find that she was personally responsible for dispensing the medications, not as a prescription department manager, but as a pharmacist. The board accepted the ALJ's determination, recognizing the fact that that determination was made based upon the testimony and the evidence presented at the hearing. The purpose of paragraph 14 is to limit the finding to only this matter based upon the presentation that was made at this particular hearing. In the future, if the board has a DOAH case where a prescription log is involved, the judge will read the other part of the Board's order that speaks to the Board's position that if the prescription department manager signs the log, as required by Board rule, they are responsible. Mr. Powers agreed with board member concerns about paragraph 14, however, he felt Mr. Rimes made the board's position clear in paragraphs 15 and 16. Ms. Fong recommended and board members concurred that paragraph 22 regarding the penalty should be modified to specify that the pharmacy inspector should be approved by the Executive Director and Mr. Powers. Ms. Fong recommended and board members concurred that the community service requirement should be imposed upon the President or CEO of Rx Network, rather than the prescription department manager. Mr. Stamitoles recommended and board members concurred that the Boards of Medicine and Osteopathic Medicine rules regarding standards for prescribing obesity drugs should be included in paragraph 18. Mr. Stamitoles and board members complimented Mr. Rimes on the language of the final order and the rapid turn around time in which it was completed. MOTION: by Barad and second by Fong to adopt the final order as amended with no further review by the board. Motion carried unanimously. TAB 2 A. Rules Development 64B16  26.100, F.A.C.

After reviewing the list of programs submitted to and reviewed by the Continuing Education Advisory Task Force, Ms. Betty Johnson moved and Ms. Jean Lemberg seconded that those programs recommended for approval be so approved, and that those programs for which denial of approval was recommended be denied. The motion passed. Mr. Holmstrom next presented to the Board two letters from Mr. Earl John Poirier regarding the reinstatement of his license to practice pharmacy. Mr. Poirier did not complete his continuing education that was due October 1, 1996, and his license to practice pharmacy then lapsed on March 1st of 1997. Mr. Poirier has been out of pharmacy since that time. Mr. Poirier is now exploring the possibility of reinstating his license to practice pharmacy, and is petitioning the Board to grant him an exception to the Board's requirement of successful passing of the Board's practical examination and completion of 400 hours of practice experienced under the direction of a Minnesota licensed pharmacist before renewal of his license to practice pharmacy. After discussing Mr. Poirier's request, and observing that pharmacy practice has changed dramatically with many new drugs and new technologies being developed in the past five years, Mr. Chuck Cooper moved and Mr. Vern Kassekert seconded that Mr. Poirier's request be denied and that he be required to fulfill all of the Board's requirements for reinstatement of a lapsed license. The motion passed. Mr. Holmstrom next presented to the Board a letter from Pharmacist Sharon Lichter. Ms. Lichter is requesting a variance from the Board that would allow her to register as a pharmacist preceptor, even though she is two months short of the two-year practice requirement for becoming a pharmacist preceptor. Ms. Lichter was licensed to practice pharmacy in July of 1999, and her two-year practice requirement would extend to July of 2001. Ms. Lichter is requesting the opportunity to act as a pharmacist preceptor for an intern beginning in May of 2001. After discussing options available to Ms. Lichter, Ms. Betty Johnson moved and Mr. Vern Kassekert seconded that the Board approve Ms. Lichter as a registered preceptor and grant the variance she requested. The motion passed. The Board next turned its attention to the review of variance requests that have been submitted to the Board since its last meeting. The Board first addressed itself to new variance requests receiving their first reading. The first variance request to be considered by the Board was submitted on behalf of Bridges Medical Center Pharmacy, in Ada, Minnesota, by Mr. Gary Rosenau, Pharmacist-in-charge. Mr. Rosenau is seeking a variance to MN Rule 6800.7400, subp. 2, regarding the amount of time a pharmacist must spend at a small hospital location that has a parttime licensed pharmacy. Mr. Rosenau is requesting a variance to the five days per week service requirement, due to the patient volume at the hospital. Currently, if a patient is admitted, the patient medications are put on a patient profile system and faxed to the local pharmacy. The medications that the patient will receive are prepared and dispensed from that site. The only medications that are prepared at the hospital site are IV or perenteral medications. In keeping with its established policy of requiring two readings for all variance requests, the Board took this request under consideration and will give it the second reading at the Board's meeting of June 14, 2001.   MINNESOTA BOARD OF PHARMACY  737 Meeting, April 25, 2001 Page 3 The next request for a variance to receive its first reading was submitted on behalf of the Woodbury HealthPartners Pharmacy, in Woodbury, Minnesota, by Mr. Brian Demuth, Pharmacist Operations Administrator for HealthPartners.

The next request for a variance to be considered by the Board was submitted on behalf of High Pointe Pharmacy, in Lake Elmo, Minnesota, by Mr. Greg Schad, Pharmacist-in-charge. Mr. Schad is requesting a variance that would allow High Pointe Pharmacy to accept returns of medications dispensed in unit dose packaging to inmates at the Washington County Jail, in Stillwater, Minnesota. The medications sent to the jail are stored in a secured area under supervision of nurses employed by Washington County, and the drug storage area at the jail is inspected monthly by Mr. Schad for outdated drugs, proper storage, and proper refrigerator of those items that require refrigeration. In keeping with its established policy of requiring two readings for all variance requests, the Board took this request under consideration and will give it the second reading at the Board's meeting of June 14, 2001. The next request for a variance receiving its first reading was submitted on behalf of St. Luke's Hospital Pharmacy, in Duluth, Minnesota, by Mr. Mike Dudzik, Director of Pharmacy. Mr. Dudzik is requesting a variance that would allow the pharmacy at St. Luke's Hospital to expand a tech-check-tech program to include the stocking and checking of automated medication dispensing units at the hospital. In keeping with its established policy of requiring two readings for all variance requests, the Board took this request under consideration and will give it the second reading at the Board's meeting of June 14, 2001. In the meantime, the Board directed Mr. Holmstrom to try to obtain more information on the type and operation of the automated distribution system used at St. Luke's Hospital. The next request for a variance to be considered by the Board was actually three identical variances requested on behalf of Fairview Hiawatha Pharmacy, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Fairview Northland Pharmacy, in Princeton, Minnesota, and Fairview Southdale Medical Pharmacy, in Edina, Minnesota. All three variances were submitted by Ms. Lisa Ganske, Regional Manager for Fairview Pharmacy Services. Ms. Ganske is requesting a variance for each of the pharmacies that would allow the pharmacy to store some pharmacy records in a dedicated pharmacy storage cabinet within the larger storage area at the clinic located outside of the current licensed pharmacy area. The space would be used only for record retention for the pharmacy and would be accessible only by limited clinic staff, with keys, which use the area for other storage such as medical records. Mr. Vern Kassekert moved and Ms. Betty Johnson seconded that the Board suspend its policy of requiring two readings for all variance requests and consider these three requests immediately. The motion passed. Mr. Vern Kassekert then moved and Ms. Betty Johnson seconded that the variances requested by Ms. Ganske for the three Fairview Clinics be approved for an indefinite period of time. The motion passed.   MINNESOTA BOARD OF PHARMACY  737 Meeting, April 25, 2001 Page 4 The next request for a variance receiving its first reading was submitted on behalf of Alliance Clinic Pharmacy (a Methadone treatment program pharmacy that is not yet opened), by Ms. Kathleen Wickstrom, Clinic Director.

Ms. Stern is requesting extensions of two previously granted variances. The first variance would allow her to continue as temporary pharmacist-in-charge at both the Rice County District One Hospital Pharmacy and at District One Community Pharmacy, while the second request would allow the use of pharmacy technicians in a ratio of three technicians to one pharmacist without any of the three technicians being certified. Mr. Chuck Cooper then moved and Ms. Betty Johnson seconded that the Board suspend its policy of requiring two readings for all variance requests and act on this request immediately. The motion passed.   MINNESOTA BOARD OF PHARMACY  737 Meeting, April 25, 2001 Page 5 Mr. Chuck Cooper moved and Mr. Vern Kassekert seconded that the variances requested by Ms. Stern be approved for a three-month period of time.

As part of this procedure, a variance is necessary for the operation of the new automated system. The variance would be to allow the pharmacy to fill these prescriptions without having the original manufacturer's container follow along to the final pharmacist check. The OptiFill II system accomplishes this for the pharmacy by comparing a digital photo taken of the medication in each vial filled by the machine and comparing it to a database photo of the same medication selected via NDC number controls. In keeping with its   MINNESOTA BOARD OF PHARMACY  737 Meeting, April 25, 2001 Page 8 policy of requiring two readings for variance requests, the Board took this request under consideration and will give it the second reading at the Board's meeting of June 14, 2001.

GX265-76-2127989	"maryland January 2004  Board of Pharmacy  The mission of the Maryland Board of Pharmacy is to protect Maryland consumers and to promote quality health care in the field of pharmacy through licensing pharmacists and issuing permits to pharmacies and distributors; setting standards for the practice of pharmacy through regulations and legislation; receiving and resolving complaints and educating consumers. The Maryland Board of Pharmacy sets standards that ensure safety and quality health care for the citizens of Maryland.  Online License Renewal for Pharmacist  I  n November 2003, the Board successfully tested and launched an online license renewal system for pharmacists. The Board of Pharmacy licenses 7,200 pharmacists. The system, created by David Mitchell, Programmer/Analyst for the Maryland Health Care Commission (MHCC) will allow pharmacists to renew their license online prior to the license expiration date. MHCC Deputy Director of Data Systems and Analysis, Ben Steffen, began developing the process two years ago in an effort to reduce data entry costs for MHCC processing Board of Physicians data. At no additional cost to the Board of Pharmacy or its licensees, the system is now available to all renewing Maryland pharmacists. Pharmacists renew their licenses every two years, by the end of their month of birth. Initially, notification was only mailed to 100 pharmacists renewing in November 2003, giving the Board Licensing and Information Services Staff an opportunity to ensure that it was operating properly. Vladimir Konstantinov, Board of Pharmacy Database Specialist, working with Sandra Jones, Information Resources Management Administration (IRMA) for the Department of Health and  L. Naesea presents Ben Steffen and David Mitchell with Certificate of Appreciation from the Board of Pharmacy  Mental Hygiene (DHMH) created additional internal processes to help ensure that renewal information is updated in 1-2 days after the pharmacist completes the renewal online. The Online Renewal system currently accepts Visa and Master Card payments online. Board Fiscal Officer, Shirley Costley worked with Karen Johnson, Senior Business Analyst at Bank of America's Electronic Payment Services division to implement the credit card payments. Pharmacists also have the option of mailing in their payment by check; however, the license will not be issued until payment is received by the Board. The Board hopes to accept electronic checks soon.  Maryland Board of Pharmacy 4201 Patterson Ave. Baltimore, MD 21215-2299 410-764-4755 www.mdbop.org  The system may not be used to obtain a new Maryland pharmacist license. Newly licensed pharmacists will be able to use the system when it is time for them to renew. The system will only allow pharmacists to renew 60 days prior to their renewal expiration date. A paper renewal application, along with online instructions, will be mailed to all pharmacists eligible for renewal. For more information, visit the Board's web site at www.mdbop.org, and click on Renew Online, or contact Tamarra Banks, Information Services Manager, at (410)764-4701.  1   President's Address  Dear Colleagues, Happy New Year to each of you! On the occasion of the New Year, I wanted to summarize a few of the many accomplishments by Board committees and staff units in 2003. The Board bid farewell to consumer member Barbara Faltz-Jackson and at-large pharmacist member/Board Secretary, Irving Lottier, and welcomed three new Board members, appointed by Governor Ehrlich: Joseph DeMino, representing chain pharmacy, Christiaan Blake, representing consumers and Mark Levi, appointed as the at-large member. The Public Information Unit continued emergency preparedness efforts, with over 500 volunteers receiving Phase I training and pharmacist liaisons and local health department representatives participating in an initial training session. The Long Term Care Task Force has remained committed to reviewing and refining related regulations. The Information and Technology Unit successfully implemented the online renewal system for establishments (pharmacies and distributors), and the online renewal system for pharmacists was also enabled in November 2003. The Maryland Health Care Commission worked with the Board's staff at no charge to design the system. Estimates for similar systems ranged from $70,000 to well over  $100,000, which should make the $34.00 fee paid to MHCC a bit more palatable, in addition to the bi-annual pharmacist license fee. The Practice and Licensing committees worked on several regulations during 2003, including: 10.34.02 Examination for Licensure and Professional Experience Programs, which repealed the requirement for pharmacy school graduates and reinstating pharmacists to pass the Maryland laboratory exam; 10.34.09 Fees, which decreased the pharmacists reciprocity fee from $250.00 to $120.00 to offset the cost of the Maryland Law Exam given by NABP; 10.34.13 Reinstatement of Expired Licenses for Pharmacists, which delineated Board response to various circumstances under which a pharmacist may be reinstated, and eliminated the requirement for reinstating pharmacists to pass the lab exam; 10.34.01 Formal Hearings procedures revised; and 10.34.29 Drug Therapy Management, which established regulations pursuant to the statutory language passed in 2003. Working closely with the Compliance Unit, the Disciplinary committee streamlined the complaint process in order to ensure standardized reviews  Stanton G. Ades, President  ""I am proud that I had an opportunity to work and lead a most energetic and thought-provoking Board, that performed outstandingly despite a year fraught with budget cuts and staff deficits.""  and facilitate a systems approach to medication errors. In addition, the committee is developing guidelines for responding to persons engaged in unlicensed practice. In meeting its strategic plan objective to keep pace with the everchanging trends in the field of pharmacy, the Licensing committee reviewed several requirements during 2003 and eliminated those that were no longer useful to meeting its mission. The requirement for new licensure candidates to mail MPJE and NAPLEX scantron applications to the Board for preliminary review is one example of an eliminated requirement. As my tenure with the Board comes to an end in FY 2004, I am proud that I had an opportunity to work and lead a most energetic and thoughtprovoking Board, that performed outstandingly despite a year fraught with budget cuts and staff deficits. I conclude by thanking each Board member, Board staff, as well as all Maryland pharmacists, for making my job as president over the past eight years thoroughly satisfying. The Board I leave behind is infinitely strong, well balanced and in capable hands. Sincerely,  Stanton G. Ades, President  2   Pediatric Dosing Errors  T  he Board of Pharmacy's Disciplinary Committee continues to receive medication error complaints from consumers dealing with pediatric medications. Using the wrong concentration of oral liquids when medications are available in different formulations is a recurring problem. Some recent examples are: A prescriber ordered Ferrous Sulfate Syrup for a small child, to be given as 5ml t.i.d. along with a notation that the dose was 54 mg of elemental Fe/day. The pharmacist dispensed Fer-In-Sol drops with instructions to give 5ml three times a day. Because the drops are much more concentrated, this would be equivalent to 250mg of elemental Fe/day--Five times the correct dose! Fortunately,  the mother questioned the dose and the prescription was corrected before it was given to the child. A child was prescribed Decadron Liquid, 1mg/ml, with directions to give 1ml q 6h. Despite the inclusion of the concentration by the prescriber on the order, the pharmacist dispensed the oral liquid with the concentration of 0.5mg/5ml, which resulted in a dramatic under dosage. The error led to an exacerbation of the illness and a prolonged treatment time. These are just two examples that highlight the problems in choosing the wrong concentration of an oral liquid. To help avoid errors with oral solutions, we offer the following recommendations:    Encourage prescribers to write prescriptions in terms of total mg per dose rather than volume to be given Request the age and weight on pediatric prescriptions Recalculate dosages to catch any errors prior to dispensing Be aware that oral liquids often come in more than one concentration. What you currently carry in your pharmacy may not be what the prescriber intended Change computer descriptions so that ""Pediatric"" appears as part of the drug name during medication selection when entering an order and on the label Set weight-based dose limits on oral liquids to alert staff  when the order exceeds a safe dose.         Once filled, place all oral liquids in a separate place or otherwise mark them, to alert the staff to call for a pharmacist when the prescription is picked up to have the directions and the instructions for accurate measuring explained to the parent or caregiver      The Board is aware that pharmacists are diligent about dispensing the correct medication to their patients. However, with increased volumes and various distractions, errors can occur. Examine your current practice to determine what you can do to prevent errors like these from happening in your pharmacy.  Three Board of Pharmacy Commissioners to be Appointed in 2004 Maryland Pharmacy Law requires that all Maryland pharmacists be notified when the terms of Board of Pharmacy members will expire to permit eligible pharmacists to seek appointments as Commissioners. The Board consists of ten pharmacists and two consumer members. In 2004, three Board members will have completed their second consecutive terms on the Board and none will be eligible for re-appointment. Seats will be open for: Chain Pharmacist. A pharmacist who is, at the time of appointment, practicing primarily in chain store pharmacies. Long Term Care Pharmacist. The person who is appointed to this position must, at the time of appointment, be practicing primarily in a pharmacy that provides services to a long-term care facility. Consumer Member.

Deadline for applications to be received by NACDS and MDASCP is February 15, 2004. Appointments take place after the terms of the incumbents expire on April 30, 2004. Commissioners' whose terms have expired, serve until a replacement is sworn in.  3   Regulations Updates COMAR 10.34.26 Patient Safety Improvement Patient Safety Improvement regulations went into effect on October 27, 2003, which will require pharmacy permit holders to: 1. Provide certain information to patients, 2. Provide certain annual education of pharmacy staff, and 3. Institute an ongoing quality assurance program. The regulations are aimed at reducing medication errors. The specific requirements of the regulations can be reviewed on COMAR 10.34.26 on the Division of State Documents' website at www.dsd.state.md.us. The records of the ongoing quality assurance program are protected from discoverability in civil proceedings. Please review Health Occupations Article 1-401, Annotated Code of Maryland. This section may be reviewed on the Maryland General Assembly's website at www.mlis.state.md.us.  COMAR 10.34.30 Name Change-Pharmacy or Distribution Permit Holder Effective November 10, 2003, a pharmacy or distributor permit holder that wants to change only the name of the pharmacy or distributor on its permit may do so for  free within 30 days of the actual name change. If there are changes beyond that of the name, the permit holder will have to file an application for a new permit. If the permit holder does not submit the request for a name change within 30 days, before or after the actual name change, a fee of $100 will be charged.  Legislative Updates Consumer Information Information on Generic Drug Option Exceptions The information is only required to be given to retail consumers. The pharmacist or the person working with the pharmacist is not required to relay the availability and cost-difference information to the consumer under the following circumstances: 1. When a prescription is specifically written for a generic drug; 2. When the authorized prescriber writes that the prescription should be dispensed as written; 3. When the pharmacist works in a pharmacy that primarily serves institutional or hospitalized patients; or 4. When the prescription is reimbursed by third party payers.  Notice of Availability of Generically Equivalent Drug and Approximate Cost Difference. Effective October 1, 2003, if a prescription is written for a brand name drug, the pharmacist or the pharmacist's designee must inform retail consumers to the best of the pharmacist or pharmacist designee's knowledge: 1. Whether there is a generically equivalent drug available, and 2. If there is a generically equivalent drug available, what the approximate cost difference is between the cost of the brand name drug and the generic drug.  4   Emergency Preparedness Pharmacist LHD Liaison Training  T  he Board of Pharmacy conducted training for Pharmacists selected to serve as liaisons between the Board of Pharmacy and Local Health Departments (LHD) in Columbia, Maryland on November 1, 2003. The liaisons are key to the Board's ability to ensure that volunteer pharmacist and technician activities carried out during a state emergency are coordinated between the state and local heath departments. Of the twenty-eight (28) ""Pharmacists LHD Liaisons"" recruited to date, twenty-one (21) participated in the training. Also, in attendance were representatives from the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH), Maryland Emergency Management Agency (MEMA), Board of Pharmacy, and Local Health Departments (LHD) representatives from Baltimore City, Frederick, Montgomery, Charles, Garrett, Prince Georges, St. Mary's, Harford, Queen Anne's, Howard, Anne Arundel, Baltimore and Allegany Counties. Stanton G. Ades, Board President and Chair of the Emergency Preparedness Committee, gave the welcome address and the training objectives. A detailed presentation on the Incident Command System (ICS) was presented by Donald M. Lumpkins, Director,  Domestic Preparedness Division, MEMA, followed by Melvin Rubin, Board Member and LaVerne Naesea, Executive Director, outlining the liaisons' roles, responsibilities and administration duties. Following the break was a 60-minute interactive panel discussion/Q & A, facilitated by Stanton Ades. The panel consisted of Donald Lumpkins, MEMA; Gail Wowk, Emergency Management Coordinator, Office of the Deputy Secretary for Public Heath Services; Percina Curtis, Director, Office of Emergency Preparedness & Response, Anne Arundel County Health Department; Bill Kelly, Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) Coordinator, Montgomery County Health Department; Barbara Rosvold, Program Supervisor, Homeland Defense, Frederick County Health Department, and Dr. Raymond Love, Board of Pharmacy Member, and Professor & Vice-Chair, Department of Pharmacy Practice & Science, University of Maryland School of Pharmacy. The participants at the training provided very positive feedback about the half-day session. Pharmacists LHD liaisons will subsequently become involved with the planning and other activities conducted by local health departments.  Pharmacist LHD Liaisons on Alert for ""Possible"" Anthrax Outbreak The Board of Pharmacy and LHD liaisons from Prince Georges and Montgomery counties were on full alert in response to the ""possible"" anthrax outbreak reported on November 7, 2003. The Board worked with DHMH, MEMA and the local health departments of Prince Georges and Montgomery counties to provide pharmacist volunteers at the treatment centers for dispensing of medications and counseling. Later that afternoon, all tested samples were proven to be negative for harmful products and the alert was canceled. The Board of Pharmacy thanks the pharmacist LHD liaisons and volunteers for promptly responding in this ""possible"" emergency in Prince Georges and Montgomery counties. The following pharmacist LHD liaisons were on alert: Dwight Roberson, Aki Hirayama, Joe DeMino, Michael Hoopes, and Stan Smith, including volunteers Phil Cogan, Mel Lessing, Melvin Rubin, Dr. Raymond Love, Donald Yee, and Herb Kwash. Pharmacists can play an important role in responding to state catastrophic events, especially those involving biological agents.

Can I come and show my new product or system to the Practice Committee? A. The Board of Pharmacy Practice Committee receives frequent requests to endorse products, systems or services. Neither the Committee nor the Board have the time to accommodate all of these requests or receive presentations. The Practice Committee and Board of Pharmacy have developed the following statement regarding this type of request: ""THE BOARD AND ITS COMMITTEES WILL NOT ENDORSE ACTIVITIES, PRODUCTS, SYSTEMS OR SERVICES. Entities are welcome to share information with the Board regarding its activities, products, systems and/or services. However, receipt of the information by the Board does not represent the Board's approval or endorsement of the product, system or service. If a stakeholder has a specific question relating to a pharmacy or licensing issue, please forward the specific question, along with contact information, to the Executive Director."" We are a pharmacy associated with an office-based dispensing prescriber. Can a pharmacist review the prescription orders of the dispensing, prescriber for appropriateness, interactions, allergies, duplications, et cetera as a service to the dispensing prescriber? A. The Practice Committee does not endorse specific systems relating to prescriber dispensing as the Board does not have jurisdiction over prescriber dispensing. However, the Committee felt that pharmacist review of a medication regimen was well within the scope of pharmacy practice. A specialty pharmacy dispenses a highcost, limited availability agent in an FDA approved, program, that requires manufacturer approval of the prescription and patient. Can we have the physician send the prescription to the manufacturer and have the manufacturer send us the prescription? A. The Committee is concerned that the integrity of the prescription becomes suspect when it does not arrive directly from the prescriber or patient. For instance, the manufacturer might alter the prescription to meet its guidelines without informing the prescriber. Since the manufacturer is not an agent of the prescriber or the patient, this would not be proper. Instead, the physician should forward prescriptions to both the pharmacy and manufacturer. Once the approval is received from the manufacturer, the specialty pharmacy could fill from the prescription received directly from the physician.  International and Internet Drug Sales THE BOARD IS COMMITTED TO PROTECTING the health, safety, and welfare of Marylanders. Although the cost of some medications and devices from sources not regulated by the United States government or the Board may be less, neither a federal regulatory body nor the Board can ensure that these medications or devices are safe for use by the citizens of Maryland. Strategies to ensure the safety of the public health include the promotion of cooperation between state and federal regulatory authorities, and educating of consumers. The Board is currently deliberating on these recommendations from the Task Force on International and Internet Drug Sales:  Educate consumers, policymakers and health care professionals on issues relating to Internet pharmacies and purchasing prescription drugs and devices from foreign sources.  Provide information to consumers, policy makers and health care professionals on ways to obtain legitimate medications and devices safely and cost-effectively.  Work closely with other state and federal agencies to ensure the safety of Marylanders.  Monitor legislative and industry activity on related issues and take appropriate action.  Investigate and respond to alleged violations of Maryland and Federal law.  Refer cases not under Board of Pharmacy jurisdiction to the appropriate agency.  7   Maryland Board of Pharmacy Board Members Stanton G. Ades-President Melvin N. Rubin-Secretary Jeanne G.

The board adopted the following regulations: 1. 12 AAC 52.020 FACILITY LICENSE, amended to alter the application requirements for a facility license. On a motion duly made by Ms. Knasiak, seconded by Mr. Bohrer, and approved unanimously, having considered public comment and any cost to private persons, it was  BR/dgl479br   ALASKA STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY MINUTES OF MEETING JULY 25, 2003 PAGE 4 OF 21 RESOLVED to adopt regulation 12 AAC 52.020(a)(3) as amended in the May 9, 2003 ""Supplemental Notice of Proposed Changes in the Regulations of the Board of Pharmacy"". 2. 12 AAC 52.030 CHANGE OF PHARMACY LOCATION OR NAME, amended to alter the requirements for changing a pharmacy location or name.

Ms. Soden summarized the history of this generic labeling regulation and the pending parallel HB 51. She noted that changes in rules on labeling requirements would be more appropriate in 12 AAC 52.480, the labeling regulation section. The board discussed the public comments received regarding changes in labeling regulations and noted the following concerns: The proposed regulation is inflexible in requiring generic labeling even if there is no generic drug available. Changes in pharmacy software systems to accommodate changes in labeling requirements would be costly, especially to small pharmacies.  BR/dgl479br   ALASKA STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY MINUTES OF MEETING JULY 25, 2003 PAGE 6 OF 21 Concern was expressed that the regulation may cause patient confusion when the drug is a multi-ingredient, compounded medication. How would the regulation apply to generic drugs with multiple ingredients? How would this regulation be enforced? Concern was expressed that the board has not communicated clearly to the HB 51 sponsors their concerns with the wording of the bill introduced in the last legislative session.  On a motion duly made by Ms. Bueler, seconded by Mr. Bohrer, and approved unanimously, having considered public comment and any cost to private persons, it was RESOLVED to table discussion of regulation 12 AAC 52.480 as amended in the May 9, 2003 ""Supplemental Notice of Proposed Changes in the Regulations of the Board of Pharmacy"" and to address this at the next meeting. Mr. Altland, who suggested that the National Association of Software Vendors could provide information and guidance, volunteered to contact the Association and report back at the next meeting. The licensing examiner will post a question through the NABP pharmacy board's web mail asking about other state's regulations for generic labeling. Senator Dyson commented that the board should clearly communicate its position to HB 51 sponsors. Senator Dyson suggested that board has two strategies for addressing the problems in HB 51: the board could make a recommendation to him so that he could request that the rules committee and senate president refer the bill back to Senator Dyson's committee for further changes, or Senator Dyson could present the board's suggested amendments on the Senate floor.

SB 156  Senator Dyson noted that Alaska leads the nation in cases prenatal alcohol poisoning of children and that SB 156 would require labeling of pregnancy related products and requires posted warnings in locations where pregnancy related products are sold. Senator Dyson asked the board for their input and support of SB 156. SB 138 Annulling Collaborative Practice - The Alaska State Medical Association (ASMA) has expressed concerns to Senator Dyson that the Pharmacy Collaborative Practice regulations have allowed for a collaboration that breaks the link between a specific patient and a specific physician. Senator Dyson presented an example of emergency contraception dispensed at a pharmacy involving minimal communication with the physician. He expressed concern that without the physician in the loop, there is a potential danger to the patient. Senator Dyson noted that he does not want SB 138 to go forward as currently written, but the bill needs to address the concerns of the medical profession and the pharmacy board without dismantling the entire collaborative practice regulation. He wants the bill to BR/dgl479br   ALASKA STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY MINUTES OF MEETING JULY 25, 2003 PAGE 13 OF 21 preserve the relationship between a specific physician and a specific patient; to protect patient safety; and preserve the good aspects of collaborative practice. Nancy Davis, Alaska Pharmacist Association, joined the meeting at 11:35 a.m. and noted that the Association has been meeting with physicians and discussing collaborative practice concerns. Ms. Bueler thanked Senator Dyson for clearly presenting his position, and noted that the Board of Pharmacy needs to be actively working with physicians to come up with wording that will be satisfactory to physicians, preserve collaborative practice, and protect the patient. Nancy Davis, Alaska Pharmacist Association asked Senator Dyson if he would withdraw SB 138. Senator Dyson replied that HB 138 is a club to force the issue of correcting the problems with current collaborative practice. Senator Dyson stressed that he would go forward with HB 138 as currently written, only if the parties are unwilling or unable to fix the problem. Senator Dyson noted that his goal is to have this resolved by beginning of the next session in February, and he requested that the board keep him in the loop as to progress on fixing current collaborative practice regulations. He noted that the board could contact him or Jason Hooley, his Legislative Aide. Senator Dyson left the meeting at 11:45 a.m. SCOTT TAGUE, TELEPHARMACY SOLUTIONS: Mr. Tague reported that there continues to be a great deal of interest across the state in telepharmacy. His company, Telepharmacy Solutions, has actively pursued providing the telepharmacy technology, but that regulations are needed. Mr. Tague offered his support to the board and noted that he could provide model telepharmacy regulations from other states. Ms. Soden noted that the regulation process can be lengthy and that the board wants to avoid prolonging the regulation cycle with multiple redrafts of regulations. Further discussion of telepharmacy is scheduled under ""New Business"" Agenda Item 18. Agenda Item 8 Report by AK Pharmacists Association SB 138 -Collaborative Practice. Nancy Davis, Association Executive Director, requested direction from the board in establishing legislative priorities, including establishing a clear position on collaborative practice. BR/dgl479br   ALASKA STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY MINUTES OF MEETING JULY 25, 2003 PAGE 14 OF 21 Ms. Bueler noted that the wording of the pharmacy regulations needs to be crystal clear on maintaining the patient  physician relationship. It was stressed that the overwhelming consideration for the board is patient safety. In order to proceed with collaborative practice relationships between pharmacists and physicians, the regulations need to be clarified and the board needs to inform and educate the medical community. In addition, it was suggested that the pharmacy regulations need to include wording on ""oversight"" that would require Medical Board approval of collaborative protocols before they are presented to the Board of Pharmacy for approval. Ms. Davis proposed that a pharmacy board member meet with Jim Jordon, AMA Director. Ms Davis requested a written statement from the board that could be presented at discussions with the AMA. Mr. Bohrer and Ms. Bueler volunteered to write the letter and email a draft to other board members. The final letter would be sent to the AK Pharmacists Association and to Senator Dyson. HB 270 Licensing of Pharmacists. Ms. Davis reported that she was present at the signing of HB 270 and thanked Representative Dahlstrom for her support on the bill. AK Pharmacists Association News .

GX269-22-15213843	"BEFORE THE WYOMING BOARD OF PHARMACY IN THE MATTER OF THE REVISION AND ADOPTION OF CERTAIN RULES OF THE WYOMING BOARD OF PHARMACY ) ) )  Case No. 00-1  ORDER ADOPTING RULES This matter came before the Wyoming Board of Pharmacy (Board) at its October 26, 2000 meeting to consider a revision of various rules of the Board, and the adoption of some new rules. Notice of the intended rule making and where to send comments was given to the Wyoming Governor, the Legislative Service Office, the Wyoming Secretary of State, the Wyoming Attorney General, those on the mailing list for the board of pharmacy's newsletter, all resident and non-resident pharmacies registered with the Board, all Wyoming hospitals, and all others who had asked to receive such notice, on or before September 11, 2000. The ""Notice of Intent to Adopt Rules and Regulations"" was published in the Casper Star Tribune on September 8 and was placed on the Board of Pharmacy's web page (http://pharmacyboard.state.wy.us).  FINDINGS OF FACT AND STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR ADOPTING RULES 1. The Board is amending Chapter 1, Section 2(k) of its rules. This is the definition of  the term ""State Board"" as used in W.S. 33-24-136(b). The amendment limits the validity of prescriptions issued by out of state practitioners to, that which could be prescribed by a similar Wyoming practitioner. Out of state practitioners should not have greater prescribing authority in Wyoming than their Wyoming counterparts have. The amendment would also move this definition from the procedural rules in Chapter 1 to the substantive rules in Chapter 2, as a housekeeping measure. The Board received a comment that the part of the definition about out 1   of state practitioners should not be part of the definition. We agree and are making this Chapter 2, section 19(c) of our rules. 2. The Board is amending Chapter 1, Section 7 of its rules to provide that a contestee in a disciplinary matter must file an answer to a complaint of the Board Staff within thirty days of mailing, instead of three working days before the hearing. The amendment also provides the answer must state what portions of the complaint the contestee admits and denies, set forth any defenses he has to the complaint, and that any portions of the complaint not so denied are deemed admitted. This is necessary so that the Board Staff can have greater advance notice from the contestee as to what contentions will be raised at the hearing. 3. The Board is adopting Chapter 2, Section 4(ii) to define the term ""patient confidences"" as it appears in W.S. 33-24-101(c)(iii). It will include information transmitted by the patient or the practitioner to the pharmacist for purposes of treatment. The amendment would allow the release of this confidential information to a minor patient's parent or guardian, and to a patient's agent or third party payor. W.S. 33-24-102(c)(iii) makes it unprofessional conduct and grounds to discipline a pharmacist who willfully betrays ""patient confidences."" However the term has not been defined. The term needs to be defined so people will know what it means and what actions are prohibited. 4. The Board is amending Chapter 2, Section 5 of its rules, pertaining to licensing of pharmacists by examination. The amendment will provide that applicants for a pharmacist license by examination must take standardized tests administered by the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, including the North American Pharmacist Licensing Examination (NAPLEX) and the Multistate Pharmacy Jurisprudence Examination (MPJE). It will establish a score of 75 as passing for both examinations. The amendment will limit an applicant who fails 2   the NAPLEX to two retakes, but place no limit on retakes of the MPJE. It will require the applicant to pay the fees the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy charges to take these examinations and to complete all requirements for licensing, including practical training, within two years of the date of his application or start the application process over. The amendment will also provide that applicants for licensing by score transfer will be considered licensed by examination and provides similar requirements to those just noted for doing so. All requirements will have to be met within one year of the date of the applicant taking the NAPLEX examination. The amendment allows the Board to require an interview of an applicant and to charge a fee to cover the administrative costs the Board involved. This amendment is necessary to specify the examinations that will be used, specify the passing score, specify how many times they may be retaken if failed, and when. It is also needed to put a time limit on the application process. Since these examinations are given nationally, it is desirable to allow applicants to take the application in another state, be licensed in that state, and transfer the test results to Wyoming and be licensed here. Occasionally, it is desirable to personally interview an applicant, as the amendment allows the Board to do. 5. Chapter 2, Section 8(b) is amended. The amendment will delete the provision that only pharmacists may have keys to the pharmacy and substitute that the pharmacist in charge may designate which employees may have keys. We believe it is better to leave this decision and the responsibility that goes with making it to the pharmacist in charge. 6. Chapter 2, Section 8(c) provides that there shall be an inventory of the controlled substances whenever there is a change in the pharmacist in charge. The amendment to this section will require the outgoing and incoming pharmacist in charge to sign the inventory. If both pharmacists in charge can not conduct the inventory together, the incoming one shall do it. 3   A copy of the inventory shall be sent to the Board office within fifteen days of completing it. The amendment requires a pharmacist and intern to report any change in places of address or employment to the Board within fifteen days of the change. It is desirable to get the incoming and outgoing pharmacist to agree on the inventory so that neither will be in a position to blame record keeping irregularities on the other one. The inventory should be sent to the board so that it will be promptly made aware of any irregularities. A change in address or employment by a pharmacist should be reported promptly to the Board so that the Board can find him when necessary and to facilitate communication and the transaction of Board business. 7. Chapter 2, Section 9 provides the pharmacist in charge shall be in full actual charge of the pharmacy and shall be present a sufficient amount of time to provide supervision and control. The proposed amendment specifies the pharmacist shall be present in the pharmacy a minimum of thirty-two hours per week or eighty percent of the time if the store is open less than forty hours per week. Since the pharmacist in charge is the person ultimately responsible for what goes on in a pharmacy, he should be there a stated minimum amount of time. If not, someone else should be the pharmacist in charge. The Board received a comment that the word ""personally"", as in the the pharmacist must be personally in full and actual charge of the pharmacy should be removed from Subsection (c)(ix), instead of deleting subsection (c)(ix). We agree. Also, the intent of this rule is to make the pharmacist in charge the person ultimately responsible for whatever goes on in his pharmacy. We believe this should be more clearly stated in the rule and are modifying Subsection (c)(ix) accordingly. The Board received comments of a housekeeping nature; that it should substitute ""at"" for ""on"" the discretion of the pharmacist and to add the word that the technician""may"" perform the following functions in Subsection (d). We agree and the rule is modified accordingly. 4   8. The Board is amending Chapter 2, Section (d) of its rules to allow a pharmacist to leave the pharmacy, but not the building, up to thirty minutes and leave a technician or technician in training on duty. The technician or technician in training may receive refill requests and receive and assemble prescriptions to be checked by the pharmacist when he returns. While the pharmacist is absent from the pharmacy, the pharmacy must be locked and a closed sign posted. New Chapter 10, Section 4(d) is adopted. This similarly allows a technician or technician in training to perform technical duties during the pharmacist's thirty-minute absence, but may not deliver prescription products to the patient or his agent during the absence. It is reasonable that a pharmacist should be allowed to leave the pharmacy, but not the building, for a short period of time and the technician to perform certain tasks in his absence. The rule spells out these tasks and the circumstances under which it is reasonable for this to occur. The Board received various comments to the effect the technician should be allowed to perform more duties in the pharmacist's absence and the pharmacist should be allowed to leave the building, as well as the pharmacy, and for a greater length of time and allow the technician to continue to work in his absence. All this may well be. However, the statutes provide the technician must work under the ""direct supervision"" of the pharmacist. The rule we are adopting allows the pharmacist to leave the pharmacy, but not the building, for up to thirty minutes and requires him to check on the technician's work before the assembled prescription drugs, label, and container are given to the patient. To go further than this, as the commenters request, creates a danger of violating the ""direct supervision"" requirement of the statute. 9. Chapter 2, Section 10(a) of the Board's rules allows prescriptions to be transferred from one pharmacy to another. The proposed amendment specifies that when this is done electronically, the requirements of W.S. 33-24-136(a) must still be met. This is necessary to 5   impose reasonable requirements for transfer of prescriptions by computer. 10. The amendment to Chapter 2, Section 19 of the Board's rules requires that oral prescriptions be recorded in writing by the pharmacist and filed according to W.S. 33-24136(a). Also, if the oral prescription is transmitted by an agent of the prescriber, the name of the agent must be recorded. It is necessary to clarify that the requirements of W.S.S 33-24-136(a) apply to oral prescriptions, as well as written ones. If the prescriber does not phone in the oral prescription, but an agent does so, the name of the agent should be recorded to minimize fraudulent prescriptions. 11. Currently Chapter 2, Section 22 of the Board's rules provide that use of fax machines in hospitals to facilitate dispensing to inpatients is not governed by Chapter 2, Sections 19(b), 20, 21, and 22. The amendment repeals this provision. Use of fax machines in hospitals will be regulated in Chapter 12. 12. Currently Chapter 4, Section 2(e) of the Board's rules provides a pharmacists may seek only fair and reasonable remuneration for his services and not charge exorbitant prices or sell below cost. The proposed amendment repeals this as it is vague and unenforceable and too many variables are involved. 13. The proposed amendment adds Chapter 4, Section 2 (m and n) to the code of ethics in the Board's rules. This will make it unprofessional conduct for a pharmacist to dispense a prescription drug without a valid prescription and will prohibit a pharmacist from working in an unlicensed pharmacy. Surprisingly, it is not as clear as it should be under the existing regulations and statutes that a pharmacist can not dispense without a prescription. If a pharmacy is not licensed, no licensed pharmacist should be working in it. The Board received a comment that this would prohibit a pharmacist from doing various tasks, such as collaborative practice, or 6   consulting with a nursing home. However, these are things that do not involve filling prescriptions and do not have to be done in and are not necessarily done in a pharmacy. Therefore, the amendment would not prohibit a pharmacist from doing this kind of work. However, if a pharmacist is filling prescriptions or otherwise working in a pharmacy, it should be a licensed pharmacy. 14. Currently Chapter 7, Section 3 (b)(ii) allows automated data processing systems for pharmacists' record keeping. The proposed amendment requires that, if this is done, the records kept shall include those required by State and Federal regulations. This is needed to specify that the State and Federal regulations apply to automated record keeping. 15. Chapter 10, Section 3(e) of the Board's rules currently provides that the pharmacist, not the technician, may counsel the patient. The proposed amendment allows a pharmacy intern, under the supervision of the pharmacist, to counsel as well. An intern has the necessary education to be a pharmacist and counsel the patient. Also, counseling is part of the necessary training an intern should be receiving as an intern. The Board received a comment that Subsection 3(e) should be amended by adding that the pharmacist is to counsel the patient ""upon determining the amount of counseling that will be necessary to promote safe and effective administration of the medication."" We reject this, as it would give the pharmacist discretion to determine the amount of counseling to be none and thereby avoid counseling at all. 16. Chapter 10, Section 4(c) of the Board's current rules require a pharmacist to draft written procedures for technicians to follow and to file a copy with the Board. The proposed amendment repeals this and eliminates unneeded paper work . 17. Chapter 10, Section 5 of the Board's current rules allows a pharmacist to supervise one technician in a non-institutional setting or two in an institutional setting. It also provides a 7   procedure and criteria whereby a non-institutional pharmacy may apply to increase the ration from one to two technicians per pharmacist. The proposed amendment repeals this and simply says a pharmacist may supervise two technicians and/or technicians in training. It specifies that technicians include registered pharmacy technicians and pharmacy technicians-in-training who are licensed or registered with the Board, but does exclude those students enrolled in the pharmacy technician program at Casper College and possessing a valid technician in training permit from the ratio. We believe a pharmacist may safely and adequately supervise two technicians and/or technicians-in-training. The Board did receive comments concerning the exclusion from the technician/pharmacist ratio of students enrolled in the Casper College pharmacy technician program as being unfair, possibly jeopardizing patient safety due to multiple students being assigned to a pharmacy, and giving an unfair economic advantage over those pharmacies who do not have students from Casper College. The Board's staff works closely with the technician training program at Casper College. This program is directed by a pharmacist licensed by this Board, and she limits numbers and length of rotation in local pharmacies so as not to place an undue burden on the pharmacy. In the retail pharmacy setting students are limited to no more than one student per pharmacy. Regarding the economic advantage, students from Casper College require extra time from preceptors, and generally do not increase the efficiency of operation of a pharmacy to which they are assigned. The Board feels without this exception these students would not be able to gain any practical experience in our state. The Casper College program is the only program in Wyoming and by allowing this exception, students from Wyoming may gain both classroom and practical experience in preparation for seeking licensure with the Board as a registered pharmacy technician. The Board feels the Casper College program is safe and presents no increased risk to Wyoming residents, 8   but rather offers a unique opportunity to train students in both a classroom and practical experience setting, which results in a technician better qualified to compete in the marketplace. 18. Chapter 10, Section 8(b) of the Board's current rules provides that a person who wants to be a pharmacy technician shall take an examination provided by the Board. Now there is a Pharmacy Technician Certification Board that examines and certifies pharmacy technicians. The amendment eliminates this Board's examination and substitutes that the applicant provides evidence of certification from the Pharmacy Technician Certification Board. It also provides the Board may interview an applicant prior to granting him a license. Since there is now a national certification board that examines and certifies technicians, it is no longer necessary for this Board to do much of the work involved. However, at times, it is still a good idea for the Board to personally interview an applicant for a license. 19. Chapter 10, Section 8(c) of the Board's current rules provide a procedure whereby a pharmacy technician can apply to reinstate an expired license; and that, if the license has been expired for more than two years, he must apply for a license and take the examination, as a new applicant would have to do. The amendment eliminates the both the ""expired for two years"" and ""examination"" requirement. It provides that an expired pharmacy technician license may be reinstated upon payment of the licensing fees, including late fees for all the years of expiration, provide proof of current certification by the Pharmacy Technician Certification Board and provide proof of continuing pharmacy education for the years of expiration, up to five years. This will be sufficient to ensure the technician has kept his skills current. The Board received a comment that the Board should recognize other certification of technicians. However, the commenter did not state what other certification should be recognized or who would do the certification. The Pharmacy Technician Certification Board is made up of representatives of the 9   National Association of Board's of Pharmacy and other disinterested nonprofit organizations. It has the skills and is adequate for the task. We do not know about other certification. In the event other certification boards, as qualified as the Pharmacy Technician Certification Board arise, the rule can be amended to recognize them. 20. Chapter 2, Section 25 of the Board's rules pertains to a situation where a manufacturer of a drug distributes the drug under its brand name and its generic name. The Board is repealing this rule, as it is obsolete and the matter is regulated by the United States Food and Drug Administration. 21. W.S. 33-24-113(a) at one time provided that hospitals, nursing homes, and homes for the elderly that dispense only to residents and inpatients were exempt from the pharmacy licensing requirement, though they were still subject to the Controlled Substance Act. Recently, the Wyoming Legislature removed this exemption. As a result, it is necessary for the Board to adopt Chapter 12 of its regulations, pertaining to institutional pharmacy practice. To the extent the Board currently has rules applying to institutional pharmacy practice, they are in Chapter 2, Section 26. This section is repealed, but some of the provisions that the Board wishes to retain are incorporated in Chapter 12. Current Chapter 2, Section 29 of the Board's rules is amended to establish an annual fee for an institutional pharmacy license, and a late fee to be assessed if the application to renew the license is not filed by a June 30 deadline. The annual fee is necessary to pay the expenses incurred by the Board in connection with this licensing. Additional expenses are incurred when the application is late. 22. Sections 1, 2, and 3 of Chapter 12 state the authority, purpose, and scope of the Chapter. Section 4 of Chapter 12 establishes definitions of the following terms that will appear in Chapter 12institutional pharmacy, institutional facility, drug room, floor stock, formulary, 10   medication order, emergency drug cart (or crash cart), and clean room. It is necessary to spell out the applicability of the chapter. Stating the purpose will be helpful when it is necessary to interpret the chapter. Certain terms of art are used in the chapter and should be defined. 23. Section 5 of Chapter 12, requires institutional pharmacies to register, renew their license annually, and pays the required fees. If they intend to provide outpatient pharmacy services, they must be licensed as a retail pharmacy too. These fees are necessary to pay the additional expenses of the Board. Section 6 requires a new registration and license in the event of a change in ownership of the institutional pharmacy and specifies what will constitute a change of ownership. This is necessary to keep track of ownership. 24. Section 7, provides that a pharmacist in charge shall direct the activities of the institutional pharmacy and what his responsibilities shall be. It also establishes minimum hours of operation for the pharmacy, requires it to establish written policies and procedures pertaining to the pharmaceutical services it provides, and establishes a ratio of technicians and technicians in training to supervising pharmacists of 2 to 1. This is necessary to establish the roles of pharmacist and technicians. As proposed, the rule required the pharmacist to be present in the institutional pharmacy a greater or lesser number of hours per week, based on number of beds in the facility. Number of beds is not as important as the number of beds for acute care patients. The rule we are adopting is modified accordingly to reflect this. 25. Sections 8, 10, and 11 establish minimum requirements for security, facilities, equipment, and drug storage in an institutional pharmacy. Section 9 establishes minimum requirements for a reference library in an institutional pharmacy. All this is necessary for a properly functioning pharmacy. A comment was received concerning Section 10 (iii), which addresses computers and software. The commenter expressed concerns that small hospitals do 11   not have computers available and this would place a burden on the facility. The rule does not require computers be available for institutional pharmacies, but that if computers and software are used, they be appropriate for the institutional facility. 26. Section 12 establishes procedures whereby institution personnel may obtain access to prescription drugs when the pharmacist and pharmacist in charge are not available. This includes requirements for storage, record keeping, and which personnel may have access. This is needed to ensure security of the drugs. The proposed rule provided that only ""supervisory nurses"" may have access to the pharmacy. The Board received a comment that this should be supervisory and ""charge nurses."" Since the title of the head nurse may vary from hospital to hospital, we believe this change should be made to the rule. 27. Section 13 allows hospitals to administer and distribute a small emergency supply of medication to outpatients and inpatients when pharmacy services are not available. Existing Chapter 2, Section 26(b) allows this. It is incorporated into proposed Section 13 with additional labeling and record keeping requirements. The adopted rule allows the administration and distribution of greater than a seventy-two hour supply in the case of drugs whose packaging does not break down to a seventy-two hour supply, such as those in a metered dose inhaler. As proposed, Section 13 provided that a ""logbook"" should be maintained for recording medication administered from the hospital emergency room. We received a comment that, while a record should be maintained, there should be alternatives to a logbook. The Board agrees and the rule, as adopted, says simply that a ""record"" must be maintained. 28. Section 14 allows hospitals to maintain drugs in and administer drugs from emergency drug carts, also known as crash carts. The adopted rule imposes necessary and  reasonable security, labeling, and record keeping requirements necessary for doing this. 12   Section 15 does the same for automated dispensing devices. A comment was received concerning Section 15, the commenter felt small hospitals are not able to procure automated dispensing devices and requiring such would place a hardship on these facilities. This rule (Section 15) does not require the use of automated dispensing devices, but does impose certain requirements if automated dispensing devices are utilized. 29. Section 16 makes the institutional pharmacist in charge responsible for preparing, labeling, and dispensing parenteral medications within the facility. It imposes necessary and reasonable requirements for adequate facilities and equipment for doing so, and for labeling. 30. Section 17 mandates the form and contents of practitioner's orders for prescription drugs and how they may be transmitted to the institutional pharmacy. It requires the institutional pharmacist to verify that the drugs dispensed are what were ordered. This is necessary for proper record keeping and to insure the correct drug is dispensed. 31. Section 18 provides how drugs are to be dispensed in an institutional facility, It includes necessary and reasonable record keeping requirements and packaging recommendations. 32. Section 19 imposes reasonable requirements for investigational drugs in an institutional facility. It requires basic information, such as that about administration, dosage form, toxicity and side effects of the drugs be maintained in the pharmacy, and imposes labeling requirements. Section 19 also requires copies of investigational drug protocols to be on file at the pharmacy. This is necessary to insure the safe use of investigational drugs. 33. Section 20, requires the pharmacist in charge or his agent in an institutional pharmacy to make a monthly inspection of the pharmacy and document and maintain records of the results. It lists specific items or matters to be inspected or determined. This is necessary to 13   insure the necessary equipment is present, drugs properly are stored, and appropriate records are kept. As proposed, Section 20 provided for a monthly inspection. We received a comment that a quarterly inspection should be sufficient. There are times when it may be. Therefore, the rule we are adopting provides that the inspection shall be done ""at least quarterly."" 34. Section 21 imposes requirements for administration of drugs that a patient brings into an institutional facility. It provides for the manner of return of the drugs to the patient or a family member if they are not administered. When a patient brings his own drugs into the facility, it is necessary to account for them and make institution personnel aware of them. 35. Section 22 imposes requirements for labeling and record keeping of controlled substances dispensed by the institutional pharmacy. It requires that outdated controlled substances are destroyed by a method approved by the pharmacist in charge and that the destruction be proper documented. This includes controlled substances applied by transdermal patches. Section 22 is needed to help prevent diversion of controlled substances. As proposed, Section 22(b) provided that ""It is recommended that at the end of each shift an inventory of all controlled substances be taken"" for each department in the hospital with a controlled substance stock. The Board received a comment that a weekly inventory should be sufficient. Also, we recognize these are rules with requirements, not ""recommendations"", though some flexibility is necessary. Therefore, the rule, as we are adopting it provides that the pharmacist in charge and the director of nursing are to get together and establish the frequency of the inventory in writing. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 1. W.S.  33-24-102(c) provides that this Board shall adopt, amend or rescind rules to administer the Wyoming Pharmacy Act in accordance with the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act. The rules herein adopted meet this requirement. 14   2. On or before September 11, 2000, the Board sent notice of this rulemaking proceeding, including a draft of the proposed rules, to the Wyoming Governor, Legislative Service Office, the Wyoming Attorney General, the Wyoming Secretary of State, those on the mailing list for the board of pharmacy's newsletter, all resident and non-resident pharmacies, all hospitals in Wyoming, and others who had previously asked to receive notice of rulemaking proceedings. Additionally, the ""Notice of Intent to Adopt Rules and Regulations"" was published in the Casper Star Tribune on September 8, 2000 and the notice was placed on the board of pharmacy's web page (http://pharmacyboard.state.wy.us). This meets the requirement of W.S.  16-3-103, 28-9-103, and 33-24-131. 3. W.S.  35-7-1053 provides the Board will administer the registration requirements of the Wyoming Controlled Substance Act and may adopt rules relating to the manufacture, distribution, and dispensing of controlled substances. 4. The rules herein adopted and attached hereto as Appendix A are necessary for the administration of the Wyoming Pharmacy Act and are in conformity with it. 5. Chapters 1, 2, 4, 7, and 10 of the Board's Rules now on file in the office of the Wyoming Secretary of State should be amended as provided herein and in Appendix A attached hereto. 6. Chapter 12 of the Board's Rules as reflected in Appendix A should be adopted. 7. Chapter 2, Sections 25 and 26, Chapter 4, Section 2(e), and Chapter 10, Section 4(c) of the Board's rules should be repealed. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that Chapters 1,2,4,7, and 10 of the rules of the Wyoming Board of Pharmacy now on file with the Registrar of Rules of the Wyoming Secretary of State be and hereby are amended as provided herein and in attached Appendix A. 15   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Chapter 12 of the Board's Rules as set forth in Appendix A attached hereto be and hereby is adopted as part of this Board's Rules. IT IS FURTHER ORDERD that Chapter 2, Section 25 and 26, Chapter 4, Section 2(e), and Chapter 10, Section 4(c) of the Board's rules be and hereby are repealed. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that deletions from rules are shown in Appendix A, by a strike-through line and additions are underlined. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the rules adopted herein are severable, and that any problems, constitutional or otherwise, that arise with respect to one or more of these rules does not affect the validity of other rules. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that consideration of the proposed amendments to Chapter 2, Sections 6,7,13, and 15, as well as the adoption of definitions of the terms ""unit dose package"", ""unit of issue package"", ""unit dose dispensing system"", ""traditional dispensing system"", ""prepackage"", ""repackage"", ""pharmacy"", ""remodeled pharmacy"" and ""active pharmacy practice"", is continued to the January 18, 2001 meeting of this Board to be held in Cheyenne, Wyoming at the Nagle-Warren Mansion, 222 East 17th Street, beginning at 9:00 am in the meeting room located in the basement.

HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT (HIPAA) The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) provides for privacy and security of an individual's health care information. The Board of Pharmacy did not implement these requirements and enforcement of the provisions of HIPAA is not the 1   responsibility of the Board. The portion affecting pharmacies becomes effective April 14, 2003. Information concerning HIPAA compliance and regulations is available at  www.cms.hhs.gov/hipaa under ""HIPAA Administration Simplification"" or contact your professional association. EXAM NOTICE - The OKLAHOMA PHARMACY LAW EXAM will be given to Graduating Pharmacy Students on APRIL 28, 2003. The Board is offering the law exam to students prior to graduation so that they may be eligible to practice as a pharmacist sooner. BOARD MEETING - JANUARY 29-30, 2003 Disciplinary Action Dale Behnke, D.Ph. #12809 - Case 650: License suspended. Charges: (1) failed to conduct himself in a manner which entitles him to the respect and confidence of the community in which he practices, (2) convicted of a felony. Harrold Lee Champlin, D.Ph. #10449 - Case 651: Received Letter of Reprimand and must view ""Error Correction Video"" and complete the accompanying course within 90 days. Charge: receive d two or more warning notices within a 12 month period. William Newton Cornwell, D.Ph. #7322 - Case 652: Received Letter of Reprimand; must view ""Error Correction Video"" and complete the accompanying course within 90 days; assessed a $500 Fine. Charge: received two or more warning notices within a 12 month period. Miral H. Parker, D.Ph. #8619 - Case 653: Assessed a $1,000 Fine; agrees to attend an approved one -day Law Seminar in the year 2003 over and above the fifteen hours of required  2   continuing education. Charges: (1) filling prescriptions that were not signed by a physician, (2) failing to conduct business as a pharmacist in conformity with all federal, state and municipal laws. The Board also took action in seven (7) impaired cases: Case 471-D.Ph. #9090 had the probation of his license removed and was returned to good standing; Case 630-D.Ph. #11157 had the restriction of his license regarding controlled dangerous substances removed; Case 594-D.Ph. #11972, Case 613-D.Ph. #12640, Case 655-D.Ph. #9588, Case 657-D.Ph. #8193 and Case 659-D.Ph. #10221 received suspension and/or probation subject to certain terms and were assessed a total of $ 7,500 in fines. FROM THE INSPECTORS:  Reminder: Bureau of Narcotics Rule 475:30-1-15 states ""pharmacists are required to obtain positive identification if they are unsure of the identity of a person picking up a prescription for any controlled dangerous substance."" We have had several patients reporting that they did not receive their medication. I.D. with a log may be a good solution.  DEA 222. Please review the requirements on completing DEA 222 forms properly. Not only when ordering. Be sure to record the items received.  Separate Files. Please set up separate files for your invoices on C -II's and C -III thru C V.  Inspectors must be able to read posted licenses and permits. Please make sure that licenses and permits are posted at a readable distance and that all license and permit numbers are clearly visible. We have found several technician permits that do not have a visible permit number because the photo is too large. 3   LONG-TERM CARE vs. ASSISTED LIVING Long -term care facilities and assisted living facilities are fundamentally different and prescriptions called in by nursing personnel from these facilities ne ed to be treated differently. Long -term care facilities provide the care and services of an intermediate care facility, a nursing facility or a skilled nursing facility. These services include mental care, nursing care or rehabilitation services as well as shelter and food. Prescriptions are written or transcribed in the patient's chart and may be called or faxed into the pharmacy by nursing personnel who are acting as agents of the prescriber. These prescriptions may be filled without further verification. Assisted living facilities provide shelter, food and care for persons who require or request such services due to age, illness or physical disability. Nursing personnel who call in a prescription are acting as an agent of the patient and these prescriptions need to be verified by the pharmacist. INTERNS MUST POST ORIGINAL CERTIFICATE! OAC 535:10-5-2 states that ""interns shall conspicuously display in their training area the intern certificate provided by the Board"". Inspectors have been finding copies of intern certificates posted in pharmacies. Interns are issued one certificate by the Board and must post that certificate. FOREIGN PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION ILLEGAL IN U.S. The FDA has testified before Congress that it is illegal to obtain prescripti on medications from a foreign country. Citizens of the U.S. cannot be assured of the quality and safety of foreign drugs. The law requires prescription medications be FDA approved. Canadian operations shipping prescriptions into Oklahoma are illegal. A lthough the FDA has 4   been working to prevent large shipments of foreign drugs from entering the United States and have not yet pursued individuals who purchase foreign medications for their personal use, both practices are illegal. There are many counterfe it medications in foreign countries. Canadian pharmacy operations require the patients to pay in advance and sign a ""Hold Harmless"" statement for the pharmacy, leaving the patient no recourse for an error. BPO (Bryan Potter's Opinion): At some point, a number of our citizens are going to be hurt. The cause of the problem and the question that should be asked is ""Why are the manufacturers of these drugs charging 50-80% less to the Canadians?"" TECHNICIAN PERMITS CANCELED The Board has canceled the permits of pharmacy technicians who failed to renew their permits for the year February 1, 2003 through January 31, 2004. Please make sure that all of your technicians have a current permit posted. ATTENTION PHARMACISTS, INTERNS & TECHNICIANS! The Oklahoma Tax Commission has notified the Board of over 40 registrants who are not in compliance with state income tax laws. If you are one of these registrants, the Tax Commission has already contacted you and a ""tax hold"" has been placed on your license. The Board cannot process any application that has a hold until this issue is resolved. Don't wait until you cannot work, contact the Oklahoma Tax Commission at 405-522-6800 and get your hold released! NEW PHARMACISTS New pharmacists licensed by the Board may be viewed on our website www.pharmacy.state.ok.us under ""Announcements"". The list is updated quarterly.

GX268-42-6962384	"Newsletter www.tsbp.state.tx.us Winter 2004  PRESIDENT'S COLUMN by Doyle E. High, R.Ph.  Pharmacy Technician Registration During the 1999 Legislative Session, the 76th Legislature gave the Board the authority to register pharmacy technicians beginning in September 2001. However, the Legislature did not give the Board any funds to implement the registration since it would not actually start until the next biennium. Therefore, the Board asked the 77th Legislature (2 001) to fund this new progr am. During this session, the pharmacy professional associations ex p ressed concerns about the law that passed in 1999. The profession was not convinced that the law should be implemented as passed. Therefore, again, the legislature did not give the Board funds to implement the r egistr ation of pharmacy technicians. After the 2001 session, the Board established a Task Force on Pharmacy Technician Registration to study the issue. In August 2002, the Task Force presented its recommendations to the Board. The first recommendation was that ""registration of pharmacy technicians should proceed in the manner outlined in S.B. 730, Acts of the 76th Legislature, including authority for the TSBP to discipline a pharmacy technician."" Finally, during the 78 th Legislative Session (2003), the Board receiv ed the necessary funding to implement the registration program.  A t the Boar d' s No v ember 2 0 0 3 meeting, rules were approved to begin the pharmacy technician registration process (see Rule Summary on page 10). The approved rules were based on the recommendations of the Task Force. Pharmacy technician registration is finally a reality. The rules specify, that beginning June 1, 2004, all individuals employed as pharmacy technicians must be either registered pharmacy technicians or pharmac y technician tr ainees , as follows: (1) All persons who have passed the required pharmacy technician certification examination must be registered with the board. (2) All persons who have not taken and passed the required pharmacy certification examination will be designated pharmacy technician trainees. With the adoption of these rules, the r egistr ation pr ocess has started. Because there are approximately 27,000 pharmacy technicians in Texa s, the Board has decided to phase in the r egistration. We ar e doing this by working with employers of pharmacy technicians. The Board is contacting employers and notifying them of the online link for their technicians to begin the registration process. The registration will be a two-step process. The first step is a Preliminary Application for Pharmacy Technician Registration. This application collects the information needed for registration. After the Preliminary Application has been pr ocessed and the pharmacy technician has been appr o ved for registration, they will be notified by  mail to go online and pay the licensing fee to complete the final step to become a registered pharmacy technician. For more information on pharmacy technician registration, see the Q & A article on page 8 of this Newsletter. Technicians have become and will continue to be an important part of the practice of pharmacy. The Board is excited to be registering pharmacy technicians and sees this as an opportunity to increase protection of the public, as well as improving the practice of pharmacy. ""  DEA FEE INCREASE Effective December 1, 2003, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) raised controlled substance registration fees for pharmacies, from $210 to $390 for a three-year registration. The fees were last adjusted in 1993. The new fees provide funding for congressionally approved enhancements, including gr eater diversion investigation capabilities, electronic commerce initiatives, and improvements to the Diversion Control Program system and services. More information on the Diversion Control Program can be found at the web site: www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov.

Methotrexate Dosing Errors May Cause DEATH! rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowe l disease, the drug is administered as a WEEKLY dose. Because relatively few medications are dosed at weekly intervals, pharmacists and pharmacy technicians may not detect prescribing erro rs and data entry/labeling erro rs of methotrexate before dispensing this drug to a patient. Methotrexate erro rs described in disciplinary cases include the following: LABELED DOSE Take 4 tablets (10 mg) orally daily. Should have been prescribed/labeled as: Take 2 tablets each week as directed. Take ten (methotrexate 2.5mg) tablets weekly.  TSBP is alarmed about the reports of fatalities or near fatalities of patients who ha v e r eceiv ed methotrexate in pr escription container s that we re mislabeled with the wrong directions for use. Patient deaths are due to methotrexate toxicity. When methotrexate is prescribed as a cytotoxic agent in oncology cases, the drug is generally prescribed as a daily dose. However, when methotrexate is used for immunomodulation in such disease states as PRESCRIBED DOSE 10 mg q week two tablets ever y day as directed (prescriber error) 7.5 mg q week 2 tabs (methotrexate 2.5 mg) twice -- 12 hours apar t (prescriber intended instructions to be inter preted as: ""Take 2 tablets weekly -- 12 hours apar t."")  Take two tablets twice daily 12 hours apar t.  PHARMACISTS MUST TAKE EXTRA PRECAUTIONS WHEN DISPENSING METHOTREXATE to include the following: (1) Pharmacists should train pharmacy technicians to treat all methotrexate prescriptions as a ""red flag"" situation (i.e., pharmacy technicians should doublecheck with the dispensing pharmacist on all methotrexate prescriptions before the prescription is entered into the pharmacy's computer system); (2) Pharmacy computer systems should be programmed to implement a ""hard stop"" on prescriptions calling for methotrexate, so that a pharmacist's oversight/ intervention is required before the methotrexate prescription can be initially data entered. In addition, computer systems should be programmed so that they never ""default"" to a daily dosing schedule. (3) Pharmacists should conduct a prospective drug regimen review to determine the intended use of the drug, verify pr oper dosing, and monitor appropriate use of the drug. (4) Pharmacists should implement a system so that patients receive verbal counseling when picking up new prescriptions and refills (e.g., ""flag"" any prescription bag containing methotrexate medications with a ""MUST COUNSEL"" sticker and take disciplinary actions against pharmacy staff who ignore such flags). (5) Pharmacists should provide clear written and verbal instructions to patients and make sure that patients understand the weekly dosing schedule. In the event that a patient has cognitive or sensory difficulties, pharmacists should ensure that the patient's agent is warned about the dangers of taking extra doses and misuse of methotrexate.  TSBP encourages all pharmacists to take steps to prevent a tragedy from occurring. ""  4  Texas State Board of Pharmacy NEWSLETTER  Winter 2004   After the Board obtains evidence of alleged violations, a licensee is sent a p reliminary notice letter of the Board's intent to institute disciplinary action. The licensee then has an opportunity to sho w compliance with the la w in an informal conference with a Board Member the Boar d staff (Ex ecutiv e Dir ector/ Secretary, Board Legal Counsel, and other staff at the discretion of the Executive Director and Board Legal Counsel). If the licensee cannot show compliance with the law and desires to dispose of any pending allegations, the licensee may consent to the entry of an ""Ag reed Board Order."" The licensee must agree to the terms of the order and the order must be approved by the Board. It should be noted that while there is agreement on the part of the licensee to the entry of an ""Agreed Board Order,"" there is neither admission nor denial of guilt with respect to any matters that have come to the attention of the Board. If a licensee, or the Board does not agree to terms of the ""Agreed Board Order"" or if the licensee does not wish to attend an informal conference, a disciplinary hearing is scheduled before an Administrative Law Judge from the Office of Administrative Hearings. The Administrative Law Judge, after hearing all evidence in the matter, will make a recommendation to the Board for action to be taken. The Board then makes a decision in the case, which is documented by the entry of a ""Board Order."" On the finding of the e xistence of grounds for discipline of a licensee, the Board may suspend, revoke, restrict, fine, refuse to issue or renew, probate, reprimand, or retire a license. The Board has directed that ""Agreed Board Orders"" and ""Board Order s"" be published in the NEWSLETTER. Although every effort is made to assure that the following information is correct, you should contact the Board's office to confirm the accuracy of the listing before making an y decision based upon this information.

In accordance with H.B. 1095 (effective May 20, 2003), advanced practice nurses and physician assistants are now included under the definition of Practitioners in the Texas Controlled Substances Act. Therefore, these professionals may seek registration from DEA and DPS. As DEA registrants, advanced practice nurses and physician assistants are categorized as Mid-Level Practitioners, and accordingly will be issued a DEA number which begins with the letter M. As is always the case, if a pharmacist questions the accuracy or authenticity of a prescription drug order, he/she must verify the order with the practitioner prior to dispensing.  Practitioner's Information on an Electronic Prescription Contrary to what may be currently understood about practitioner's signatures on electronic prescription drug orders (i.e., faxed prescriptions), an electronic prescription drug order does NOT require a practitioner's manual or electronic signature. Electronic prescription drug orders are considered the same as verbal prescription drug orders. Practitioners must furnish their name, and if for a controlled substance, their address and DEA registration number on all electronic prescription drug orders. For a complete list of all the required information that must be on an electronic prescription see Section 291.34 (b)(6)(B), of the current Board Rules. If a pharmacist questions the accuracy or authenticity of a prescription drug order, he/she must verify the order with the practitioner prior to dispensing.  Delivery of Prescriptions During the Absence of a Pharmacist In the absence of a pharmacist, the operation of a pharmacy (i.e., receiving, processing, preparing, prescriptions, etc.) by pharmacy technicians or other non-pharmacist personnel is prohibited. Therefore, pharmacy technicians may not carry out pharmacy technician duties (i.e., initiating and receiving refill authorization requests, entering prescription data into a data processing system, taking stock bottles from the shelf for prescription, preparing and packaging prescription drug orders, affixing prescription labels, reconstituting medication, prepackaging, compounding, etc.) unless a pharmacist is present in the prescription department, or unless the pharmacist is on the premises in accordance with the temporary absence of pharmacist rules (i.e. ""lunch break rules"") outlined under Section 291.33 (b) (4) of the Board Rules. However, an agent of the pharmacist may deliver a completed prescription (i.e., hands the completed prescription to the patient and rings up the sale) during short periods of time when a pharmacist is absent from the pharmacy, provided that the short periods of time do not exceed two hours, and in accordance with additional record keeping and delivery requirements outlined under Section 291.33(c)(1)(E) of the Board Rules.  Medications Linked in Pharmacy Computer Systems Computer programs often link two products indicating that a generic equivalent is available. Don't assume that products linked on a pharmacy's computer system are generically equivalent or ""A"" rated. In Texas, a pharmacist may substitute only when the two drugs involved are listed as ""A"" rated products in the federal Food and Drug Administration's publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly called the ""Orange Book."" If a drug is not listed in the Orange Book, pharmacists may not substitute without the practitioner's authorization. For example, Hemocyte Plus is not listed in the Orange Book. Accordingly, there is no generic equivalent recognized in Texas for this drug and a pharmacist must either dispense the actual product prescribed or contact the prescriber for authorization to substitute another manufacturer's drug product. The Orange Book is available online at: www.fda.gov/cder/ob to verify generically equivalent medications.

All other corrections must be sent to TSBP in writing. Written changes may be faxed to (512) 305-8075 attention: Technician Registration Specialist. (7) Are Registered Pharmacy Technicians required to obtain Continuing Education (CE)? YES. TSBP rules require 20 hours of CE be obtained during the renewal period. The TSBP requirements are the same as those required by the Pharmacy Technician Certification Board. Pharmacy technicians who are certified by PTCB and maintain this certification will meet continuing education requirements of TSBP and are not subject to audit by the Board. (8) Where should Pharmacy Technicians send CE hours? Do not send CE hours to TSBP. Pharmacy technicians must maintain proof of CE. TSBP will conduct random audits. If you are subject to an audit, you will be instructed to submit proof. (Please note that PTCB CE requirements are separate from the TSBP requirements.) (9) I have a felony drug charge. Will I still be able to pursue a career as a Pharmacy Technician? According to the Texas Pharmacy Act, a conviction for a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude or a felony is g rounds for the Board to refuse to issue a Pharmacy Technician registration. Additionally, a violation of the Texas Controlled Substances Act or Dangerous Drug Act is also grounds for refusal. A criminal history is not an absolute bar to receiving a registration, but each case will be evaluated individually based on the nature and seriousness of the crime, length of time since the conviction, past criminal history and rehabilitation of the applicant, and other relevant facts. You will be notified if any problems are encountered. (10) Are Pharmacy Technicians required to attend a special training course or obtain a formal education? Individuals need to gain some training before attempting the PTCB exam. This can be accomplished through a technician-training course, but a course is not required. TSBP rules outline the training requirements. Training can be completed on-the-job while working as a technician trainee. TSBP rules allow an individual to be designated as a technician trainee for up to one year while preparing for and taking the PTCB exam. TSBP recommends you review the recently adopted rules regarding pharmacy technicians on page 13 of this Newsletter. see Q&A: Pharmacy Technician Registration on page 9  (1) I would like to work as a Pharmacy Technician in Texas. What are the requirements of the Texas State Board of Pharmacy (TSBP)? Currently, TSBP requires technicians to be certified. In order to be certified, technicians must take and pass the Pharmacy Technician Certification Exam given by the Pharmac y Technician Certification Boar d (PTCB). Information concerning the Pharmac y Te chnician Certification Exam can be obtained from PTCB's website at http://www.ptcb.org or by calling (202) 429-7576. Beginning June 1, 2004, Pharmacy Technicians must also be registered with TSBP. (2) How do I get registered? The registration process is a two-step online process. TSBP is currently working with pharmacy employers in order to phase in the initial registration process. Your employer will notify you when it is time for you to begin. Your employer will also provide you with information on how to register. If you have not been notified, please check this web page in March 2004 for more information. If you are an employer, and you have not been contacted by TSBP, have your technicians check our web page in March 2004. (3) Will a Registered Pharmacy Technician have more responsibility? The duties of a technician have not changed. Please refer to the chart at the end of this document for information on duties that can be performed by pharmacy technicians. (4) Are Pharmacy Technicians required to maintain their PTCB cer tification and registration? The rules state that you must have a current certification for initial registration. Once you are registered with TSBP, you may choose whether or not to maintain your PTCB certification. One advantage of maintaining your PTCB certification is that you will not be subject to CE audits by TSBP. Howeve r, PTCB conducts random CE audits of certified pharmacy technicians. (5) When will my technician registration expire? Renewal dates will be based on your birth month and will expire on the last day of the month in which you were born. As technicians register, the year of expiration will be staggered, which means some registrations will expire during the first year following initial registration while others will expire during the second year from initial registration. After the ""stagger in"" period, registrations will renew biennially (every two years). (6) After I am registered, how do I change or correct my information? TSBP Rules require you to keep your name, address and place of employment current (within 10 days of a change). Once the system is in place, you will be able to make  8  Texas State Board of Pharmacy NEWSLETTER  Winter 2004   Q&A: Pharmacy Technician Registration continued from page 8  WHO MAY PERFORM THE FOLLOWING DUTIES UNTIL JUNE 1, 2004 Duties may be performed only after in-store training Registered Technician (includes registered exempt technicians) YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES Technicianin-Training (includes exempt technicians not yet registered) YES YES YES YES NO YES YES YES YES  Pharmacy Technician Duties (all tasks must be under the direct super vision of a pharmacist)  Certified Technician (not registered)  Initiate and receive refill authorization requests Enter prescription data into a data processing system Take a stock bottle from the shelf for a prescription Prepare and package drug orders (i.e., count tablets/capsules, measure liquids and place them in the container) Affix label to the prescription container Reconstitute medications Prepackage and label prepackaged drugs Load bulk unlabeled drugs into an automated dispensing system Compound non-sterile prescriptions  YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES  WHO MAY PERFORM THE FOLLOWING DUTIES AFTER JUNE 1, 2004 Duties may be performed only after in-store training Registered Technician (includes registered exempt technicians) YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES Technicianin-Training (includes Cer tified Technicians not yet registered) YES YES YES YES NO YES YES YES YES  Pharmacy Technician Duties (all tasks must be performed under the direct super vision of a pharmacist)  Initiate and receive refill authorization requests Enter prescription data into a data processing system Take a stock bottle from the shelf for a prescription Prepare and package drug orders (i.e., count tablets/capsules, measure liquids and place them in the container) Affix label to the prescription container Reconstitute medications Prepackage and label prepackaged drugs Load bulk unlabeled drugs into an automated dispensing Compound non-sterile prescriptions  Texas State Board of Pharmacy NEWSLETTER  Winter 2004  9   ADOPTED RULES !!! RULE SUMMARY !!! 291.1. Pharmacy License Application. The adopted amendment specifies that the Board may waive a pre-inspection prior to issuing a pharmacy license for good cause shown by the applicant. The amendment adds this waiver authority to the current authority which specifies that the Board may waive a pre-inspection if the applicant holds an active pharmacy license in Texas on the date of application. 291.6.

The repeal and simultaneous adoption of the new rule increases the initial licensing fee by $5 and the renewal fee by $2 to fund the Office of Patient Protection as authorized by H.B. 2985 passed by the 78th Texas Legislature. 291.8. Return of Prescription Drugs. The repeal and simultaneous adoption of the new rule implements the provisions of section 2.126, of H.B. 2292 passed by the 78th Legislative Session by establishing procedures: (1) for a consultant pharmacist in health care facilities to return unused drugs to pharmacies; and (2) for pharmacies to handle the returned drugs. 291.29.

The $1 fee increase for the issuance of a new license is a result of a $2 decrease in the licensing fee, a $2 decrease in the surcharge to fund a program to aid impaired pharmacists, and a $5 increase for the initial licensing fee to fund the Office of Patient Protection as authorized by H.B. 2985 passed by the 78th Texas Legislature. 297.1 - 297.9 The new rules establish a system for the registration of pharmacy technicians.  !!!

GX268-70-5137376	"March 2001  Kentucky Board of Pharmacy 23 Millcreek Park Frankfort, KY 40601-9230  New Board Appointee Governor Paul Patton appointed C. Joe Carr to serve on the Board, effective January 1, 2001. The appointment shall be effective through Janaury 1, 2004. Mr Carr practices as a hospital pharmacist at Methodist Hospital in Henderson. He is a 1981 graduate of the University of Kentucky College of Pharmacy and served as president of the Kentucky Pharmacists Association in 1997. Mr Carr 's appointment succeeds the appointment of David L. Jaquith, who served two terms and was president of the Board in 2000. The Board members and staff wish to extend their most sincere appreciation to Mr Jaquith for his dedication and service to the citizens of the Commonwealth. Mr Carr joins the following members of the Kentucky Board of Pharmacy for 2001: William A. Conyers III, president, Glasgow; Thomas S. Foster, Nicholasville; Georgina K. Jones, Louisville; Melinda C. Joyce, Bowling Green; and Becky M. Cooper, Georgetown.  Under the PPPA, the general rule is that child-resistant prescription containers cannot be reused when a refill request is processed for patients who return the empty prescription vial. A limited exception to this rule exists when the container is glass. In this instance, only the child-resistant cap must be replaced. The pharmacist must exercise professional judgment as to whether the glass containers should be refilled and redispensed. Although not required by law, it is recommended that a pharmacist document a patient's request for nonsafety closures in the pharmacy's computer system or on the original prescription. Pharmacists may obtain blanket authorizations from patients requesting nonsafety closures. Pharmacists should routinely verify this request with the patient to determine if conditions have changed.  Physicians Prescribing Methadone for Detoxification Physicians should refrain from prescribing and/or dispensing methadone to patients for purposes of detoxifying or maintaining a narcotic addict unless licensed by the Department for Mental Health and Retardation and registered with the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Methadone may be used in the treatment of pain experienced by a patient with a terminal illness or chronic disorder. Questions regarding any part of the Narcotic Addict Treatment Act of 1974 should contact DEA at 502/582-5908 or the State Methadone Authority at 502/564-4448.  Notifications to the Board Office Pharmacists-in-charge and/or pharmacists are required to notify the Board in writing if any of the following occur: 1. Change in the pharmacist-in-charge or staff pharmacist; 2. Change of employment; 3. Schedule of hours for the pharmacy; 4. Change of mailing address; and 5. Change of name. Changes of name must be accompanied by a copy of the legal document that authorized the name change (eg, marriage license or divorce decree). Numbers 1, 2, and 3 shall be submitted within fourteen (14) calendar days of changes pursuant to 201 KAR 2:205.  Pill Splitting Pharmacy and drug inspectors have been noticing an increase of tablets being split for different reasons. Pharmacists have expressed that more physicians are prescribing doses typically not available from manufacturers, which requires pharmacists to split the tablets to obtain the prescribed dose. Other reasons included requests from third-party payers and occasionally requests from patients. Inaccuracies in pill splitting, the lack of testing on the effectiveness of split pills, and the potential for an overdose are the primary issues of concern. Pharmacists should utilize professional judgment to determine what is in the best interest of the patient when deciding whether to split tablets. The pharmacist should make sure the patient understands the inexactness of pill splitting and the possible effects that may occur from an inexact dose. Additionally, pharmacists should be concerned with proper labeling of the dispensed product.  2001 Pharmacist License Renewals License renewals for 2001 were mailed to all Kentucky licensed pharmacists in early January. Pharmacists continuing to practice after the February 28, 2001 licensure expiration deadline without a renewal and pocket card are in violation of statute. Pharmacists should have proof of general continuing education and Cabinet for Health Services-approved HIV/AIDS continuing education completed and certified by December 31, 2000, at their primary place of practice for review by the pharmacy and drug inspectors.  Child-Resistant Prescription Containers The Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970 (PPPA) mandates that prescription drugs be placed in special containers designed to be difficult for children to open.  Generic Substitution Kentucky law requires pharmacists to substitute and dispense US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved generic drugs  Continued on page 4  KY Vol. 20, No. 3  Page 1   Continued from page 1 when presented with a prescription for a brand name drug, unless otherwise instructed by the patient or his/her practitioner. Although a few exceptions to this regulation exist, it generally applies to the great majority of prescriptions for brand name drugs. Either the prescriber or patient may direct the pharmacist to forego the substitution regulation and dispense brand name medication. The prescriber generally directs the pharmacist through a designation written on the prescription such as ""do not substitute"" or ""dispense as written."" The patient generally does so by oral direction. The pharmacist is required to dispense brand medication when so directed. Adverse ramifications for reimbursement to patients by insurance companies or health care plans for out-of-pocket prescription payments may exist if the prescriber or patient directs the pharmacist to dispense brand name medication. A patient should receive full and customary reimbursement when the prescriber directs that only a brand name drug be dispensed. However, a patient may be required to forego full reimbursement or pay a higher co-payment to the pharmacist if the patient directs the pharmacist to dispense a brand name when the prescriber has not so indicated. Under Kentucky Medicaid Assistance Program (KMAP) regulations, the prescriber must write in his/her own handwriting ""brand name medically necessary"" when a generic product is available and the prescriber wishes the brand name product be dispensed. KMAP Maximum Allowable Cost (MAC) overrides regulations that permit pharmacists 45 days to secure a written ""brand name medically necessary"" override on any prescription for which reimbursement greater than MAC is requested. Whether oral or written, a pharmacist may dispense an innovator product and secure the ""brand name medically necessary"" override, after the fact, within the 45-day period. ""Generic substitution"" should not be confused with ""therapeutic interchange."" Kentucky does not currently have laws permitting therapeutic interchange, as this term applies to substitution of one therapeutic entity for another in the same or similar drug class (ie, Motrin for Naprosyn). In the absence of such laws, pharmacists and pharmacies providing care to patients must prepare and dispense prescription orders consistent with the original written or oral prescription.  Pharmacy computers that print ""Dr"" or ""MD"" on the prescription label should contact their software vendors to have this deficiency corrected. The prescription label should reflect the correct designation of the prescriber.  Common Questions Regarding Continuing Education Q1: How do I report proof of continuing education (CE) completed? A1: Each pharmacist on his/her pharmacist license renewal application should check the appropriate checkoff box. Certificates of completion are not required to be forwarded to the Board office unless requested or in compliance with an Agreed Order. Continuing education must be completed and certified between Janaury through December 31st of each year. Q2: When two different dates appear on my certificate of completion, which one do I use? A2: If you participated in a home study course, the course is not considered complete until you receive a certificate of completion from the provider with a dated certifying signature. If you attended a live program, the completion date and credit date for the program is the day that you attended the program. Q3: How long do I maintain my continuing education certificates on file at my primary place of practice? A3: You should maintain your certificates of completion for three (3) years after you report the hours on your pharmacist renewal application. Q4: I recently relocated, and I cannot find all of my CE certificates. How do I get replacements? A4: You should contact the continuing education providers. They are required to maintain CE records of completion on file for four (4) years.

Significant Points Employment will grow faster than the average, but the number of job openings created will be low, because the occupation is small. Job prospects will be good due to an aging population and increased need for vascular technology and sonography as an alternative for more costly and invasive heart surgery. About 7 out of 10 jobs are in hospitals, in both inpatient and outpatient settings.  Nature of the Work Cardiovascular technologists and technicians assist physicians in diagnosing and treating cardiac (heart) and peripheral vascular (blood vessel) ailments. Cardiovascular technologists may specialize in three areas of practice: Invasive cardiology, echocardiography, and vascular technology. Cardiovascular technicians who specialize in electrocardiograms (EKGs), stress testing, and Holter monitors are known as cardiographic or EKG technicians. Cardiovascular technologists specializing in invasive procedures are called cardiology technologists. They assist physicians with cardiac catheterization procedures in which a small tube, or catheter, is wound through a patient's blood vessel from a spot on the patient's leg into the heart. The procedure can determine if a blockage exists in the blood vessels that supply the heart muscle and help diagnose other problems. Part of the procedure may involve balloon angioplasty, which can be used to treat blockages of blood vessels or heart valves, without the need for heart surgery. Cardiology technologists assist physicians as they insert a catheter with a balloon on the end to the point of the obstruction. Technologists prepare patients for cardiac catheterization and balloon angioplasty by first positioning them on an examining table and then shaving, cleaning, and administering anesthesia to the top of the patient's leg near the groin. During the procedures, they monitor patients' blood pressure and heart rate using EKG equipment and notify the physician if something appears wrong. Technologists also may prepare and monitor patients during open-heart surgery and the implantation of pacemakers. Cardiovascular technologists who specialize in echocardiography or vascular technology often run noninvasive tests using ultrasound instrumentation, such as doppler ultrasound. Tests are called ""noninvasive"" if they do not require the insertion of probes or other instruments into the patient's body. The ultrasound instrumentation transmits high frequency sound waves into areas of the patient's body and then processes reflected echoes of the sound waves to form an image. Technologists view the ultrasound image on a screen that may be recorded on videotape or photographed for interpretation and diagnosis by a physician. While performing the scan, technologists check the image on the screen for subtle differences between healthy and diseased areas, decide which images to include, and judge if the images are satisfactory for diagnostic purposes. They also explain the procedure to patients, record additional medical history, select appropriate equipment settings, and change the patient's position as necessary. (See the statement on diagnostic medical sonographers elsewhere in the Handbook to learn more about other sonographers.) 2  Those who assist physicians in the diagnosis of disorders affecting circulation are known as vascular technologists or vascular sonographers. They perform a medical history and evaluate pulses by listening to the sounds of the arteries for abnormalities. Then they perform a noninvasive procedure using ultrasound instrumentation to record vascular information, such as vascular blood flow, blood pressure, limb volume changes, oxygen saturation, cerebral circulation, peripheral circulation, and abdominal circulation. Many of these tests are performed during or immediately after surgery. Technologists who use ultrasound to examine the heart chambers, valves, and vessels are referred to as cardiac sonographers, or echocardiographers. They use ultrasound instrumentation to create images called echocardiograms. This may be done while the patient is either resting or physically active. Technologists may administer medication to a physically active patient to assess their heart function. Cardiac sonographers may also assist physicians who perform transesophageal echocardiography, which involves placing a tube in the patient's esophagus to obtain ultrasound images. Cardiovascular technicians who obtain EKGs are known as electrocardiograph (or EKG) technicians. To take a basic EKG, which traces electrical impulses transmitted by the heart, technicians attach electrodes to the patient's chest, arms, and legs, and then manipulate switches on an EKG machine to obtain a reading. A printout is made for interpretation by the physician. This test is done before most kinds of surgery and as part of a routine physical examination, especially for persons who have reached middle age or have a history of cardiovascular problems.  About 7 out of 10 cardiovascular technologists and technicians work in hospitals.   EKG technicians with advanced training perform Holter monitor and stress testing. For Holter monitoring, technicians place electrodes on the patient's chest and attach a portable EKG monitor to the patient's belt. Following 24 or more hours of normal activity for the patient, the technician removes a tape from the monitor and places it in a scanner. After checking the quality of the recorded impulses on an electronic screen, the technician usually prints the information from the tape so that a physician can interpret it later. Physicians use the output from the scanner to diagnose heart ailments, such as heart rhythm abnormalities or problems with pacemakers. For a treadmill stress test, EKG technicians document the patient's medical history, explain the procedure, connect the patient to an EKG monitor, and obtain a baseline reading and resting blood pressure. Next, they monitor the heart's performance while the patient is walking on a treadmill, gradually increasing the treadmill's speed to observe the effect of increased exertion. Like vascular technologists and cardiac sonographers, cardiographic technicians who perform EKG, Holter monitor, and stress tests are known as ""noninvasive"" technicians. Some cardiovascular technologists and technicians schedule appointments, type doctor interpretations, maintain patient files, and care for equipment. Working Conditions Technologists and technicians generally work a 5-day, 40-hour week that may include weekends. Those in catheterization labs tend to work longer hours and may work evenings. They also may be on call during the night and on weekends. Cardiovascular technologists and technicians spend a lot of time walking and standing. Those who work in catheterization labs may face stressful working conditions, because they are in close contact with patients with serious heart ailments. Some patients, for example, may encounter complications from time to time that have life or death implications. Employment Cardiovascular technologists and technicians held about 39,000 jobs in 2000. Most worked in hospital cardiology departments, whereas some worked in offices of cardiologists or other physicians, cardiac rehabilitation centers, or ambulatory surgery centers. Training, Other Qualifications, and Advancement Although a few cardiovascular technologists, vascular technologists, and cardiac sonographers are currently trained on the job, most receive training in 2- to 4-year programs. Cardiovascular technologists, vascular technologists, and cardiac sonographers normally complete a 2-year junior or community college program. One year is dedicated to core courses followed by a year of specialized instruction in either invasive, noninvasive cardiovascular, or noninvasive vascular technology. Those who are qualified in a related allied health profession only need to complete the year of specialized instruction. Graduates from the 23 programs accredited by the Joint Review Committee on Education in Cardiovascular Technology are eligible to obtain professional certification through Cardiovascular Credentialing International in cardiac catheterization, echocardiography, vascular ultrasound, and cardiographic techniques. Cardiac sonographers and vascular technologists may also obtain certification with the American Registry of Diagnostic Medical Sonographers. For basic EKGs, Holter monitoring, and stress testing, 1-year certificate programs exist; but most EKG technicians are still trained on the job by an EKG supervisor or a cardiologist. On-the-job  training usually lasts about 8 to 16 weeks. Most employers prefer to train people already in the health care field--nursing aides, for example. Some EKG technicians are students enrolled in 2-year programs to become technologists, working part-time to gain experience and make contact with employers. Cardiovascular technologists and technicians must be reliable, have mechanical aptitude, and be able to follow detailed instructions. A pleasant, relaxed manner for putting patients at ease is an asset. Job Outlook Employment of cardiovascular technologists and technicians is expected to grow faster than the average for all occupations through the year 2010. Growth will occur as the population ages, because older people have a higher incidence of heart problems. Employment of vascular technologists and echocardiographers will grow as advances in vascular technology and sonography reduce the need for more costly and invasive procedures. Employment of EKG technicians is expected to decline, as hospitals train nursing aides and others to perform basic EKG procedures. Individuals trained in Holter monitoring and stress testing are expected to have more favorable job prospects than those who can only perform a basic EKG. Some job openings for cardiovascular technologists and technicians will arise from replacement needs, as individuals transfer to other jobs or leave the labor force. Relatively few job openings, due to both growth and replacement needs are expected, however, because the occupation is small. Earnings Median annual earnings of cardiovascular technologists and technicians were $33,350 in 2000. The middle 50 percent earned between $24,590 and $43,450. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $19,540, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $52,930. Median annual earnings of cardiovascular technologists and technicians in 2000 were $33,100 in offices and clinics of medical doctors and $32,860 in hospitals. Related Occupations Cardiovascular technologists and technicians operate sophisticated equipment that helps physicians and other health practitioners diagnose and treat patients. So do diagnostic medical sonographers, nuclear medicine technologists, radiation therapists, radiologic technologists and technicians, and respiratory therapists.

Significant Points Clinical laboratory technologists usually have a bachelor 's degree with a major in medical technology or in one of the life sciences; clinical laboratory technicians need either an associate's degree or a certificate. Employment is expected to grow as fast as average as the volume of laboratory tests increases with population growth and the development of new types of tests.  Nature of the Work Clinical laboratory testing plays a crucial role in the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of disease. Clinical laboratory technologists, also referred to as clinical laboratory scientists or medical technologists, and clinical laboratory technicians, also known as medical technicians or medical laboratory technicians, perform most of these tests. Clinical laboratory personnel examine and analyze body fluids, tissues, and cells. They look for bacteria, parasites, and other microorganisms; analyze the chemical content of fluids; match blood for transfusions; and test for drug levels in the blood to show how a patient is responding to treatment. These technologists also prepare specimens for examination, count cells, and look for abnormal cells. They use automated equipment and instruments capable of performing a number of tests simultaneously, as well as microscopes, cell counters, and other sophisticated laboratory equipment. Then, they analyze the results and relay them to physicians. With increasing automation and the use of computer technology, the work of technologists and technicians has become less hands-on and more analytical. The complexity of tests performed, the level of judgment needed, and the amount of responsibility workers assume depend largely on the amount of education and experience they have. Medical and clinical laboratory technologists generally have a bachelor 's degree in medical technology or in one of the life sciences, or they have a combination of formal training and work experience. They perform complex chemical, biological, hematological, immunologic, microscopic, and bacteriological tests. Technologists microscopically examine blood, tissue, and other body substances. They make cultures of body fluid and tissue samples, to determine the presence of bacteria, fungi, parasites, or other microorganisms. They analyze samples for chemical content or reaction and determine blood glucose and cholesterol levels. They also type and cross match blood samples for transfusions. Medical and clinical laboratory technologists evaluate test results, develop and modify procedures, and establish and monitor programs, to ensure the accuracy of tests. Some medical and clinical laboratory technologists supervise medical and clinical laboratory technicians. Technologists in small laboratories perform many types of tests, whereas those in large laboratories generally specialize. Technologists who prepare specimens and analyze the chemical and hormonal 4  Laboratory technologists and technicians examine and analyze body fluids, tissues, and cells. contents of body fluids are clinical chemistry technologists. Those who examine and identify bacteria and other microorganisms are microbiology technologists. Blood bank technologists, or immunohematology technologists, collect, type, and prepare blood and its components for transfusions. Immunology technologists examine elements and responses of the human immune system to foreign bodies. Cytotechnologists prepare slides of body cells and microscopically examine these cells for abnormalities that may signal the beginning of a cancerous growth. Molecular biology technologists perform complex genetic testing on cell samples. Medical and clinical laboratory technicians perform less complex tests and laboratory procedures than technologists. Technicians may prepare specimens and operate automated analyzers, for example, or they may perform manual tests following detailed instructions. Like technologists, they may work in several areas of the clinical laboratory or specialize in just one. Histology technicians cut and stain tissue specimens for microscopic examination by pathologists, and phlebotomists collect blood samples. They usually work under the supervision of medical and clinical laboratory technologists or laboratory managers. Working Conditions Hours and other working conditions of clinical laboratory technologists and technicians vary, according to the size and type of employment setting. In large hospitals or in independent laboratories that operate continuously, personnel usually work the day, evening,   or night shift and may work weekends and holidays. Laboratory personnel in small facilities may work on rotating shifts, rather than on a regular shift. In some facilities, laboratory personnel are on call several nights a week or on weekends, in case of an emergency. Clinical laboratory personnel are trained to work with infectious specimens. When proper methods of infection control and sterilization are followed, few hazards exist. Protective masks, gloves, and goggles are often necessary to ensure the safety of laboratory personnel. Laboratories usually are well-lighted and clean; however, specimens, solutions, and reagents used in the laboratory sometimes produce fumes. Laboratory workers may spend a great deal of time on their feet. Employment Clinical laboratory technologists and technicians held about 295,000 jobs in 2000. About half worked in hospitals. Most of the remaining jobs were found in medical laboratories or offices and clinics of physicians. A small number were in blood banks, research and testing laboratories, and in the Federal Government--at U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals and U.S. Public Health Service facilities. Training, Other Qualifications, and Advancement The usual requirement for an entry-level position as a medical or clinical laboratory technologist is a bachelor 's degree with a major in medical technology or in one of the life sciences. Universities and hospitals offer medical technology programs. It also is possible to qualify through a combination of education, on-the-job, and specialized training. Bachelor 's degree programs in medical technology include courses in chemistry, biological sciences, microbiology, mathematics, statistics, and specialized courses devoted to knowledge and skills used in the clinical laboratory. Many programs also offer or require courses in management, business, and computer applications. The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA) requires technologists who perform certain highly complex tests to have at least an associate's degree. Medical and clinical laboratory technicians generally have either an associate's degree from a community or junior college or a certificate from a hospital, vocational or technical school, or from one of the U.S. Armed Forces. A few technicians learn their skills on the job. The National Accrediting Agency for Clinical Laboratory Sciences (NAACLS) fully accredits 503 programs for medical and clinical laboratory technologists, medical and clinical laboratory technicians, histologic technologists and technicians, and pathologists' assistants. NAACLS also approves 70 programs in phlebotomy, cytogenetic technology, molecular biology, and clinical assisting. Other nationally recognized accrediting agencies include the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs (CAAHEP) and the Accrediting Bureau of Health Education Schools (ABHES). Some States require laboratory personnel to be licensed or registered. Information on licensure is available from State departments of health or boards of occupational licensing. Certification is a voluntary process by which a nongovernmental organization, such as a professional society or certifying agency, grants recognition to an individual whose professional competence meets prescribed standards. Widely accepted by employers in the health industry, certification is a prerequisite for most jobs and often is necessary for advancement. Agencies certifying medical and clinical laboratory technologists and technicians include the Board of Registry of the American Society for Clinical Pathology, the American  Medical Technologists, the National Credentialing Agency for Laboratory Personnel, and the Board of Registry of the American Association of Bioanalysts. These agencies have different requirements for certification and different organizational sponsors. Clinical laboratory personnel need good analytical judgment and the ability to work under pressure. Close attention to detail is essential, because small differences or changes in test substances or numerical readouts can be crucial for patient care. Manual dexterity and normal color vision are highly desirable. With the widespread use of automated laboratory equipment, computer skills are important. In addition, technologists in particular are expected to be good at problem solving. Technologists may advance to supervisory positions in laboratory work or become chief medical or clinical laboratory technologists or laboratory managers in hospitals. Manufacturers of home diagnostic testing kits and laboratory equipment and supplies seek experienced technologists to work in product development, marketing, and sales. Graduate education in medical technology, one of the biological sciences, chemistry, management, or education usually speeds advancement. A doctorate is needed to become a laboratory director. However, federal regulation allows directors of moderate complexity laboratories to have either a master 's degree or a bachelor 's degree combined with the appropriate amount of training and experience. Technicians can become technologists through additional education and experience. Job Outlook Employment of clinical laboratory workers is expected to grow about as fast as the average for all occupations through the year 2010, as the volume of laboratory tests increases with population growth and the development of new types of tests. Technological advances will continue to have two opposing effects on employment through 2010. New, increasingly powerful diagnostic tests will encourage additional testing and spur employment. On the other hand, research and development efforts targeted at simplifying routine testing procedures may enhance the ability of nonlaboratory personnel, physicians and patients, in particular, to perform tests now done in laboratories. Although significant, growth will not be the only source of opportunities. As in most occupations, many openings will result from the need to replace workers who transfer to other occupations, retire, or stop working for some other reason. Earnings Median annual earnings of medical and clinical laboratory technologists were $40,510 in 2000. The middle 50 percent earned between $34,220 and $47,460. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $29,240, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $55,560.

Internet: http://www.naacls.org  Nature of the Work Dental assistants perform a variety of patient care, office, and laboratory duties. They work chairside as dentists examine and treat patients. They make patients as comfortable as possible in the dental chair, prepare them for treatment, and obtain dental records. Assistants hand instruments and materials to dentists, and keep patients' mouths dry and clear by using suction or other devices. Assistants also sterilize and disinfect instruments and equipment, prepare tray setups for dental procedures, and instruct patients on postoperative and general oral health care. Some dental assistants prepare materials for making impressions and restorations, expose radiographs, and process dental x-ray film as directed by a dentist. They also may remove sutures, apply anesthetics to gums or cavity-preventive agents to teeth, remove excess cement used in the filling process, and place rubber dams on the teeth to isolate them for individual treatment. Those with laboratory duties make casts of the teeth and mouth from impressions taken by dentists, clean and polish removable appliances, and make temporary crowns. Dental assistants with office duties schedule and confirm appointments, receive patients, keep treatment records, send bills, receive payments, and order dental supplies and materials. Dental assistants should not be confused with dental hygienists, who are licensed to perform different clinical tasks. (See the statement on dental hygienists elsewhere in the Handbook.)

Significant Points Rapid employment growth and substantial replacement needs should result in good job opportunities. Dentists are expected to hire more assistants to perform routine tasks so that they may devote their own time to more profitable procedures. Infection control is a crucial responsibility of dental assistants. Proper infection control protects patients and members of the dental health team.  Dental assistants hand instruments and materials to dentists and keep patients' mouths dry and clear.  6   Working Conditions Dental assistants work in a well-lighted, clean environment. Their work area usually is near the dental chair so that they can arrange instruments, materials, and medication and hand them to the dentist when needed. Dental assistants wear gloves, masks, eyewear, and protective clothing to protect themselves and their patients from infectious diseases. Following safety procedures also minimizes the risks associated with the use of radiographic equipment. Almost half of dental assistants have a 35- to 40-hour workweek, which may include work on Saturdays or evenings. Employment Dental assistants held about 247,000 jobs in 2000. Almost 2 out of 5 worked part time, sometimes in more than one dental office. Virtually all dental assistants work in a private dental office. A small number work in dental schools, private and government hospitals, State and local public health departments, or clinics. Training, Other Qualifications, and Advancement Most assistants learn their skills on the job, though some are trained in dental assisting programs offered by community and junior colleges, trade schools, technical institutes, or the Armed Forces. Assistants must be a dentist's ""third hand""; therefore, dentists look for people who are reliable, can work well with others, and have good manual dexterity. High school students interested in a career as a dental assistant should take courses in biology, chemistry, health, and office practices. The American Dental Association's Commission on Dental Accreditation approved 248 dental assisting training programs in 2000. Programs include classroom, laboratory, and preclinical instruction in dental assisting skills and related theory. In addition, students gain practical experience in dental schools, clinics, or dental offices. Most programs take 1 year or less to complete and lead to a certificate or diploma. Two-year programs offered in community and junior colleges lead to an associate degree. All programs require a high school diploma or its equivalent, and some require a typing or science course for admission. Some private vocational schools offer 4- to 6-month courses in dental assisting, but the Commission on Dental Accreditation does not accredit these. Some States regulate the duties dental assistants may complete through licensure or registration. Licensure or registration may require passing a written or practical examination. States offering licensure or registration have a variety of schools offering courses-- approximately 10 to 12 months in length--that meet their State's requirements. Some States require continuing education to maintain licensure or registration. A few States allow dental assistants to perform any function delegated to them by the dentist. Individual States have adopted different standards for dental assistants who perform certain medical duties, such as radiological procedures. Completion of the Radiation Health and Safety examination offered by the Dental Assisting National Board, Inc. (DANB) meets those standards in 31 States. Some States require the completion of a State-approved course in radiology as well. Certification is available through DANB and is recognized or required in 20 States. Other organizations offer registration, most often at the State level. Certification is an acknowledgment of an assistant's qualifications and professional competence, and may be an asset when seeking employment. Candidates may qualify to take the DANB certification examination by graduating from an accredited training program or by having 2 years of full-time, or 4 years of part-time, experience as a dental assistant. In addition, applicants  must have current certification in cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Recertification is offered annually for applicants who have earned continuing education credits. Without further education, advancement opportunities are limited. Some dental assistants become office managers, dental assisting instructors, or dental product sales representatives. Others go back to school to become dental hygienists. For many, this entry-level occupation provides basic training and experience and serves as a steppingstone to more highly skilled and higher paying jobs. Job Outlook Job prospects for dental assistants should be good. Employment is expected to grow much faster than the average for all occupations through the year 2010. In addition, numerous job openings will occur due to the need to replace assistants who transfer to other occupations, retire, or leave the labor force for other reasons. Many opportunities are for entry-level positions offering on-thejob training. Population growth and greater retention of natural teeth by middle-aged and older people will fuel demand for dental services. Older dentists, who are less likely to employ assistants, will leave and be replaced by recent graduates, who are more likely to use one, or even two. In addition, as dentists' workloads increase, they are expected to hire more assistants to perform routine tasks, so that they may devote their own time to more profitable procedures. Earnings Median hourly earnings of dental assistants were $12.49 in 2000. The middle 50 percent earned between $9.99 and $15.51 an hour. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $8.26, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $18.57 an hour. Benefits vary substantially by practice setting and may be contingent upon full-time employment. According to the American Dental Association's 1999 Workforce Needs Assessment Survey, almost all full-time dental assistants employed by private practitioners received paid vacation. The survey also found that 9 out of 10 full- and part-time dental assistants received dental coverage. Related Occupations Workers in other occupations supporting health practitioners include medical assistants, occupational therapist assistants and aides, pharmacy aides, pharmacy technicians, physical therapist assistants and aides, and veterinary technologists, technicians, and assistants.

Significant Points Dental hygienists are projected to be one of the 30 fastest growing occupations. Population growth and greater retention of natural teeth will stimulate demand for dental hygienists. Opportunities for part-time work and flexible schedules are common.  Dental hygienists work in clean, well-lighted offices. Important health safeguards include strict adherence to proper radiological procedures, and use of appropriate protective devices when administering anesthetic gas. Dental hygienists also wear safety glasses, surgical masks, and gloves to protect themselves from infectious diseases. Employment Dental hygienists held about 147,000 jobs in 2000. Because multiple jobholding is common in this field, the number of jobs exceeds the number of hygienists. More than half of all dental hygienists worked part time--less than 35 hours a week. Almost all dental hygienists work in private dental offices. Some work in public health agencies, hospitals, and clinics. Training, Other Qualifications, and Advancement Dental hygienists must be licensed by the State in which they practice. To qualify for licensure, a candidate must graduate from an accredited dental hygiene school and pass both a written and clinical examination. The American Dental Association Joint Commission on National Dental Examinations administers the written examination accepted by all States and the District of Columbia. State or regional testing agencies administer the clinical examination. In addition, most States require an examination on legal aspects of dental hygiene practice. Alabama allows candidates to take its examinations if they have been trained through a State-regulated on-the-job program in a dentist's office. In 2000, the Commission on Dental Accreditation accredited about 256 programs in dental hygiene. Although some programs lead to a bachelor 's degree, most grant an associate degree. A dozen universities offer master 's degree programs in dental hygiene or a related area. An associate degree is sufficient for practice in a private dental office. A bachelor 's or master 's degree usually is required for research, teaching, or clinical practice in public or school health programs. About half of the dental hygiene programs prefer applicants who have completed at least 1 year of college. However, requirements vary from one school to another. Schools offer laboratory, clinical, and classroom instruction in subjects such as anatomy, physiology, chemistry, microbiology, pharmacology, nutrition, radiography, histology (the study of tissue structure), periodontology (the study of gum diseases), pathology, dental materials, clinical dental hygiene, and social and behavioral sciences. Dental hygienists should work well with others and must have good manual dexterity because they use dental instruments within a patient's mouth, with little room for error. High school students interested in becoming a dental hygienist should take courses in biology, chemistry, and mathematics. Job Outlook Employment of dental hygienists is expected to grow much faster than the average for all occupations through 2010, in response to increasing demand for dental care and the greater substitution of the services of hygienists for those previously performed by dentists. Job prospects are expected to remain very good unless the number of dental hygienist program graduates grows much faster than during the last decade, and results in a much larger pool of qualified applicants. Population growth and greater retention of natural teeth will stimulate demand for dental hygienists. Older dentists, who are less likely to employ dental hygienists, will leave and be replaced by recent graduates, who are more likely to do so. In addition, as dentists' workloads increase, they are expected to hire more hygienists to  Nature of the Work Dental hygienists remove soft and hard deposits from teeth, teach patients how to practice good oral hygiene, and provide other preventive dental care. Hygienists examine patients' teeth and gums, recording the presence of diseases or abnormalities. They remove calculus, stains, and plaque from teeth; take and develop dental x rays; and apply cavity-preventive agents such as fluorides and pit and fissure sealants. In some States, hygienists administer anesthetics; place and carve filling materials, temporary fillings, and periodontal dressings; remove sutures; perform root-planing as a periodontal therapy; and smooth and polish metal restorations. Although hygienists may not diagnose diseases, they can prepare clinical and laboratory diagnostic tests for the dentist to interpret. Hygienists sometimes work chairside with the dentist during treatment. Dental hygienists also help patients develop and maintain good oral health. For example, they may explain the relationship between diet and oral health, or even the link between oral health and such serious conditions as heart disease and stroke. They also inform patients how to select toothbrushes and show them how to brush and floss their teeth. Dental hygienists use hand and rotary instruments and ultrasonics to clean and polish teeth, x-ray machines to take dental pictures, syringes with needles to administer local anesthetics, and models of teeth to explain oral hygiene. Working Conditions Flexible scheduling is a distinctive feature of this job. Full-time, part-time, evening, and weekend schedules are widely available. Dentists frequently hire hygienists to work only 2 or 3 days a week, so hygienists may hold jobs in more than one dental office.  Hygienists clean and examine teeth and gums, noting the presence of diseases or abnormalities. 8   perform preventive dental care such as cleaning, so that they may devote their own time to more profitable procedures. Earnings Median hourly earnings of dental hygienists were $24.68 in 2000. The middle 50 percent earned between $20.46 and $29.72 an hour. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $15.53, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $35.39 an hour. Earnings vary by geographic location, employment setting, and years of experience. Dental hygienists who work in private dental offices may be paid on an hourly, daily, salary, or commission basis. Benefits vary substantially by practice setting, and may be contingent upon full-time employment. According to the American Dental Association's 1999 Workforce Needs Assessment Survey, almost all full-time dental hygienists employed by private practitioners received paid vacation. The survey also found that 9 out of 10 full- and parttime dental hygienists received dental coverage. Dental hygienists who work for school systems, public health agencies, the Federal Government, or State agencies usually have substantial benefits. Related Occupations Workers in other occupations supporting health practitioners in an office setting include dental assistants, medical assistants, occupational therapist assistants and aides, physical therapist assistants and aides, physician assistants, and registered nurses.

Based upon these observations and the dentist's specifications, technicians build and shape a wax tooth or teeth model, using small hand instruments called wax spatulas and wax carvers. They use this wax model to cast the metal framework for the prosthetic device. After the wax tooth has been formed, dental technicians pour the cast and form the metal and, using small hand-held tools, prepare the surface to allow the metal and porcelain to bond. They then apply porcelain in layers, to arrive at the precise shape and color of a tooth. Technicians place the tooth in a porcelain furnace to bake the porcelain onto the metal framework, and then adjust the shape and color, with subsequent grinding and addition of porcelain to achieve a sealed finish. The final product is a nearly exact replica of the lost tooth or teeth. In some laboratories, technicians perform all stages of the work, whereas in other labs, each technician does only a few. Dental laboratory technicians can specialize in one of five areas: Orthodontic appliances, crowns and bridges, complete dentures, partial dentures, or ceramics. Job titles can reflect specialization in these areas. For example, technicians who make porcelain and acrylic restorations are called dental ceramists. Working Conditions Dental laboratory technicians generally work in clean, well-lighted, and well-ventilated areas. Technicians usually have their own work-  For information about accredited programs and educational requirements, contact: ! Commission on Dental Accreditation, American Dental Association, 211 E.

Dental Laboratory Technicians (O*NET 51-9081.00)  !  !  Significant Points Employment should increase slowly, as the public's improving dental health requires fewer dentures but more bridges and crowns. Dental laboratory technicians need artistic aptitude for detailed and precise work, a high degree of manual dexterity, and good vision.  Nature of the Work Dental laboratory technicians fill prescriptions from dentists for crowns, bridges, dentures, and other dental prosthetics. First, dentists send a specification of the item to be fabricated, along with an impression (mold) of the patient's mouth or teeth. Then, dental laboratory technicians, also called dental technicians, create a model of the patient's mouth by pouring plaster into the impression and allowing it to set. Next, they place the model on an apparatus that mimics the bite and movement of the patient's jaw. The model serves as the basis of the prosthetic device. Technicians examine  Dental laboratory technicians use molds of patients' teeth to design crowns, bridges, dentures, and other dental prosthetics. 9   benches, which can be equipped with Bunsen burners, grinding and polishing equipment, and hand instruments, such as wax spatulas and wax carvers. The work is extremely delicate and time consuming. Salaried technicians usually work 40 hours a week, but self-employed technicians frequently work longer hours. Employment Dental laboratory technicians held about 43,000 jobs in 2000. Most jobs were in commercial dental laboratories, which usually are small, privately owned businesses with fewer than five employees. However, some laboratories are large; a few employ more than 50 technicians. Some dental laboratory technicians work in dentists' offices. Others work for hospitals providing dental services, including U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs' hospitals. Some technicians work in dental laboratories in their homes, in addition to their regular job. Training, Other Qualifications, and Advancement Most dental laboratory technicians learn their craft on the job. They begin with simple tasks, such as pouring plaster into an impression, and progress to more complex procedures, such as making porcelain crowns and bridges. Becoming a fully trained technician requires an average of 3 to 4 years, depending upon the individual's aptitude and ambition, but it may take a few years more to become an accomplished technician. Training in dental laboratory technology also is available through community and junior colleges, vocational-technical institutes, and the Armed Forces. Formal training programs vary greatly both in length and in the level of skill they impart. In 2000, 30 programs in dental laboratory technology were approved (accredited) by the Commission on Dental Accreditation in conjunction with the American Dental Association (ADA). These programs provide classroom instruction in dental materials science, oral anatomy, fabrication procedures, ethics, and related subjects. In addition, each student is given supervised practical experience in a school or an associated dental laboratory. Accredited programs normally take 2 years to complete and lead to an associate degree. Graduates of 2-year training programs need additional hands-on experience to become fully qualified. Each dental laboratory owner operates in a different way, and classroom instruction does not necessarily expose students to techniques and procedures favored by individual laboratory owners. Students who have taken enough courses to learn the basics of the craft usually are considered good candidates for training, regardless of whether they have completed a formal program. Many employers will train someone without any classroom experience. The National Board for Certification, an independent board established by the National Association of Dental Laboratories, offers certification in dental laboratory technology. Certification, which is voluntary, can be obtained in five specialty areas: crowns and bridges, ceramics, partial dentures, complete dentures, and orthodontic appliances. In large dental laboratories, technicians may become supervisors or managers. Experienced technicians may teach or may take jobs with dental suppliers in such areas as product development, marketing, and sales. Still, for most technicians, opening one's own laboratory is the way toward advancement and higher earnings. A high degree of manual dexterity, good vision, and the ability to recognize very fine color shadings and variations in shape are 10  necessary. An artistic aptitude for detailed and precise work also is important. High school students interested in becoming dental laboratory technicians should take courses in art, metal and wood shop, drafting, and sciences. Courses in management and business may help those wishing to operate their own laboratories. Job Outlook Job opportunities for dental laboratory technicians should be favorable, despite very slow growth in the occupation. Employers have difficulty filling trainee positions, probably because entry-level salaries are relatively low and because the public is not familiar with the occupation. Although job opportunities are favorable, slower-than-average growth in the employment of dental laboratory technicians is expected through the year 2010, due to changes in dental care. The overall dental health of the population has improved because of fluoridation of drinking water, which has reduced the incidence of dental cavities, and greater emphasis on preventive dental care since the early 1960s. As a result, full dentures will be less common, as most people will need only a bridge or crown. However, during the last few years, demand has arisen from an aging public that is growing increasingly interested in cosmetic prostheses. For example, many dental laboratories are filling orders for composite fillings that are the same shade of white as natural teeth to replace older, less attractive fillings. Earnings Median hourly earnings of dental laboratory technicians were $12.94 in 2000. The middle 50 percent earned between $9.83 and $16.82 an hour. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $7.78, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $21.47 an hour. Median hourly earnings of dental laboratory technicians in 2000 were $12.88 in offices and clinics of dentists and $12.87 in medical and dental laboratories. Technicians in large laboratories tend to specialize in a few procedures, and, therefore, tend to be paid a lower wage than those employed in small laboratories that perform a variety of tasks. Related Occupations Dental laboratory technicians fabricate artificial teeth, crowns and bridges, and orthodontic appliances, following specifications and instructions provided by dentists. Other workers who make and repair medical devices include dispensing opticians, ophthalmic laboratory technicians, orthotists and prosthetists, and precision instrument and equipment repairers.

Significant Points Sonographers should experience favorable job opportunities as ultrasound becomes an increasingly attractive alternative to radiologic procedures. More than half of all sonographers are employed by hospitals, and most of the remainder work in physicians' offices and clinics, including diagnostic imaging centers. Beginning in 2005, an associate or higher degree from an accredited program will be required for registration.  Nature of the Work Diagnostic imaging embraces several procedures that aid in diagnosing ailments, the most familiar being the x ray. Another increasingly common diagnostic imaging method, called magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), uses giant magnets and radio waves rather than radiation to create an image. Not all imaging technologies use ionizing radiation or radio waves, however. Sonography, or ultrasonography, is the use of sound waves to generate an image used for assessment and diagnosis of various medical conditions. Many people associate sonography with obstetrics and the viewing of the fetus in the womb. But this technology has many other applications in the diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions. Diagnostic medical sonographers, also known as ultrasonographers, use special equipment to direct nonionizing, high frequency sound waves into areas of the patient's body. Sonographers operate the equipment, which collects reflected echoes and forms an image that may be videotaped, transmitted, or photographed for interpretation and diagnosis by a physician. Sonographers begin by explaining the procedure to the patient and recording any additional medical history that may be relevant to the condition being viewed. They then select appropriate equipment settings and direct the patient to move into positions that will provide the best view. To perform the exam, sonographers use a transducer, which transmits sound waves in a cone- or rectangleshaped beam. Although techniques vary based on the area being examined, sonographers usually spread a special gel on the skin to aid the transmission of sound waves. Viewing the screen during the scan, sonographers look for subtle visual cues that contrast healthy areas from unhealthy ones. They decide whether the images are satisfactory for diagnostic purposes and select which ones to show to the physician. Diagnostic medical sonographers may specialize in obstetric and gynecologic sonography (the female reproductive system), abdominal sonography (the liver, kidneys, gallbladder, spleen, and pancreas), neurosonography (the brain), or ophthalmologic sonography (the eyes). In addition, sonographers also may specialize in vascular technology or echocardiography. (Vascular technologists and echocardiographers are covered in the Handbook statement on cardiovascular technologists and technicians.) Obstetric and gynecologic sonographers specialize in the study of the female reproductive system. This includes one of the more well known uses of sonography: examining the fetus of a pregnant woman to track its growth and health. Abdominal sonographers inspect a patient's abdominal cavity to help diagnose and treat conditions involving primarily the gallbladder, bile ducts, kidneys, liver, pancreas, and spleen. Abdominal sonographers also are able to scan parts of the heart, although  A diagnostic medical sonographer examines a patient using a transducer, creating images with sound waves.  diagnosis of the heart using ultrasound usually is done by echocardiographers. Neurosonographers use ultrasound technology to focus on the nervous system, including the brain. In neonatal care, neurosonographers study and diagnose neurological and nervous system disorders in premature infants. They also may scan blood vessels to check for abnormalities indicating a stroke in infants diagnosed with sickle cell anemia. Like other sonographers, neurosonographers operate transducers to perform the ultrasound, but use different frequencies and beam shapes than obstetric and abdominal sonographers. Ophthalmologic sonographers use ultrasound to study the eyes. Ultrasound aids in the insertion of prosthetic lenses by allowing accurate measurement of the eyes. Ophthalmologic ultrasound also helps diagnose and track tumors, blood supply conditions, separated retinas, and other ailments of the eye and the surrounding tissue. Ophthalmologic sonographers use high frequency transducers made exclusively to study the eyes, which are much smaller than those used in other specialties. In addition to working directly with patients, diagnostic medical sonographers keep patient records and adjust and maintain equipment. They also may prepare work schedules, evaluate equipment purchases, or manage a sonography or diagnostic imaging department. 11   Working Conditions Most full-time sonographers work about 40 hours a week; they may have evening weekend hours and times when they are on call and must be ready to report to work on short notice. Sonographers typically work in healthcare facilities that are clean and well lit. Some travel to patients in large vans equipped with sophisticated diagnostic equipment. Sonographers are on their feet for long periods and may have to lift or turn disabled patients. They work at diagnostic imaging machines but may also do some procedures at patients' bedsides. Employment Diagnostic medical sonographers held about 33,000 jobs in 2000. More than half of all sonographer jobs are in hospitals. Most of the rest are in physicians' offices and clinics, primarily in offices specializing in obstetrics and in diagnostic imaging centers. According to the 2000 Sonography Benchmark Survey conducted by the Society of Diagnostic Medical Sonographers (SDMS), about three out of four sonographers worked in urban areas. Training, Other Qualifications, and Advancement There are several avenues for entry into the field of diagnostic medical sonography. Sonographers may train in hospitals, vocationaltechnical institutions, colleges and universities, and the Armed Forces. Some training programs prefer applicants with a background in science or experience in other health professions, but also will consider high school graduates with courses in math and science, as well as applicants with liberal arts backgrounds. Colleges and universities offer formal training in both 2- and 4year programs, culminating in an associate or bachelor 's degree. Two-year programs are most prevalent. Course work includes classes in anatomy, physiology, instrumentation, basic physics, patient care, and medical ethics. The Joint Review Committee on Education for Diagnostic Medical Sonography accredits most formal training programs--76 programs in 1999. Some health workers, such as obstetric nurses and radiologic technologists, seek to increase their marketability by cross-training in fields such as sonography. Many take 1-year programs resulting in a certificate. Additionally, sonographers specializing in one discipline often seek competency in others; for example, obstetric sonographers might seek training in and exposure to abdominal sonography to broaden their opportunities. While no State requires licensure in diagnostic medical sonography, the American Registry of Diagnostic Medical Sonographers (ARDMS) certifies the competency of sonographers through registration. Because registration provides an independent, objective measure of an individual's professional standing, many employers prefer to hire registered sonographers. Registration with ARDMS requires passing a general physics and instrumentation examination, in addition to passing an exam in a specialty such as obstetrics/gynecology, abdominal, or neurosonography. While formal education is not necessary to take the exams, an associate or bachelor 's degree from an accredited program is preferred. Beginning in 2005, ARDMS will consider for registration only those holding an associate or higher degree. To keep their registration current, sonographers must complete 30 hours of continuing education every 3 years to stay abreast of advances in the occupation and in technology. Sonographers need good communication and interpersonal skills because they must be able to explain technical procedures and results to their patients, some of whom may be nervous about the exam or the problems it may reveal. They also should have 12  some background in math and science, especially when they must perform mathematical and scientific calculations in analyses for diagnosis.  Job Outlook Employment of diagnostic medical sonographers is expected to grow faster than the average for all occupations through 2010 as the population grows and ages, increasing the demand for diagnostic imaging and therapeutic technology. Some job openings also will arise from the need to replace sonographers who leave the occupation. Ultrasound is becoming an increasingly attractive alternative to radiologic procedures as patients seek safer treatment methods. Because ultrasound--unlike most diagnostic imaging methods--does not involve radiation, harmful side effects and complications from repeated use are rarer for both the patient and the sonographer. Sonographic technology is expected to evolve rapidly and to spawn many new ultrasound procedures, such as 3D-ultrasonography for use in obstetric and ophthalmologic diagnosis. However, high costs may limit the rate at which some promising new technologies are adopted. Hospitals will remain the principal employer of diagnostic medical sonographers. However, employment is expected to grow more rapidly in offices and clinics of physicians, including diagnostic imaging centers. Health facilities such as these are expected to grow very rapidly through 2010 due to the strong shift toward outpatient care, encouraged by third-party payers and made possible by technological advances that permit more procedures to be performed outside the hospital.  Earnings Median annual earnings of diagnostic medical sonographers were $44,820 in 2000. The middle 50 percent earned between $38,390 and $52,750 a year. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $32,470, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $59,310. Median annual earnings of diagnostic medical sonographers in 2000 were $43,950 in hospitals and $46,190 in offices and clinics of medical doctors.  Related Occupations Diagnostic medical sonographers operate sophisticated equipment to help physicians and other health practitioners diagnose and treat patients. Workers in related occupations include cardiovascular technologists and technicians, clinical laboratory technologists and technicians, nuclear medicine technologists, radiologic technologists and technicians, and respiratory therapists.

Significant Points Job stress is common due to irregular hours and treating patients in life-or-death situations. Formal training and certification are required but State requirements vary. Employment is projected to grow faster than average as paid emergency medical technician positions replace unpaid volunteers.  Nature of the Work People's lives often depend on the quick reaction and competent care of emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and paramedics, EMTs with additional advanced training to perform more difficult pre-hospital medical procedures. Incidents as varied as automobile accidents, heart attacks, drownings, childbirth, and gunshot wounds all require immediate medical attention. EMTs and paramedics provide this vital attention as they care for and transport the sick or injured to a medical facility. Depending on the nature of the emergency, EMTs and paramedics typically are dispatched to the scene by a 911 operator and often work with police and fire department personnel. (Police and detectives and firefighting occupations appear elsewhere in the Handbook.) Once they arrive, they determine the nature and extent of the patient's condition while trying to ascertain whether the patient has preexisting medical problems. Following strict rules and guidelines, they give appropriate emergency care and, when necessary, transport the patient. Some paramedics are trained to treat patients with minor injuries on the scene of an accident or at their home without transporting them to a medical facility. Emergency treatments for more complicated problems are carried out under the direction of medical doctors by radio preceding or during transport. EMTs and paramedics may use special equipment such as backboards to immobilize patients before placing them on stretchers and securing them in the ambulance for transport to a medical facility. Usually, one EMT or paramedic drives while the other monitors the patient's vital signs and gives additional care as needed. Some EMTs work as part of the flight crew of helicopters that transport critically ill or injured patients to hospital trauma centers. At the medical facility, EMTs and paramedics help transfer patients to the emergency department, report their observations and actions to staff, and may provide additional emergency treatment. After each run, EMTs and paramedics replace used supplies and check equipment. If a transported patient had a contagious disease, EMTs and paramedics decontaminate the interior of the ambulance and report cases to the proper authorities. Beyond these general duties, the specific responsibilities of EMTs and paramedics depend on their level of qualification and training. To determine this, the National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians (NREMT) registers emergency medical service (EMS) providers at four levels: First Responder, EMT-Basic, EMT-Intermediate, and EMT-Paramedic. Some States, however, do their own certification and use numeric ratings from 1 to 4 to distinguish levels of proficiency. The lowest level--First Responders--are trained to provide basic emergency medical care because they tend to be the first persons to arrive at the scene of an incident. Many firefighters, police  Emergency medical technicians and paramedics often are the first to examine a patient during an emergency.  officers, and other emergency workers have this level of training. The EMT-Basic, also known as EMT-1, represents the first component of the emergency medical technician system. An EMT-1 is trained to care for patients on accident scenes and on transport by ambulance to the hospital under medical direction. The EMT-1 has the emergency skills to assess a patient's condition and manage respiratory, cardiac, and trauma emergencies. The EMT-Intermediate (EMT-2 and EMT-3) has more advanced training that allows administration of intravenous fluids, use of manual defibrillators to give lifesaving shocks to a stopped heart, and use of advanced airway techniques and equipment to assist patients experiencing respiratory emergencies. EMT-Paramedics (EMT-4) provide the most extensive pre-hospital care. In addition to the procedures already described, paramedics may administer drugs orally and intravenously, interpret electrocardiograms (EKGs), perform endotracheal intubations, and use monitors and other complex equipment. Working Conditions EMTs and paramedics work both indoors and outdoors, in all types of weather. They are required to do considerable kneeling, bending, and heavy lifting. These workers risk noise-induced hearing loss from sirens and back injuries from lifting patients. In addition, EMTs and paramedics may be exposed to diseases such as Hepatitis-B and AIDS, as well as violence from drug overdose victims or 13   mentally unstable patients. The work is not only physically strenuous, but also stressful, involving life-or-death situations and suffering patients. Nonetheless, many people find the work exciting and challenging and enjoy the opportunity to help others. EMTs and paramedics employed by fire departments work about 50 hours a week. Those employed by hospitals frequently work between 45 and 60 hours a week, and those in private ambulance services, between 45 and 50 hours. Some of these workers, especially those in police and fire departments, are on call for extended periods. Because emergency services function 24 hours a day, EMTs and paramedics have irregular working hours that add to job stress. Employment EMTs and paramedics held about 172,000 jobs in 2000. Most career EMTs and paramedics work in metropolitan areas. There are many more volunteer EMTs and paramedics, especially in smaller cities, towns, and rural areas. They volunteer for fire departments, emergency medical services (EMS), or hospitals and may respond to only a few calls for service per month, or may answer the majority of calls, especially in smaller communities. EMTs and paramedics work closely with firefighters, who often are certified as EMTs as well and act as first responders. Full- and part-time paid EMTs and paramedics were employed in a number of industries. About 4 out of 10 worked in local and suburban transportation, as employees of private ambulance services. About 3 out of 10 worked in local government for fire departments, public ambulance services and EMS. Another 2 out 10 were found in hospitals, where they worked full time within the medical facility or responded to calls in ambulances or helicopters to transport critically ill or injured patients. The remainder worked in various industries providing emergency services. Training, Other Qualifications, and Advancement Formal training and certification is needed to become an EMT or paramedic. All 50 States possess a certification procedure. In 38 States and the District of Columbia, registration with the National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians (NREMT) is required at some or all levels of certification. Other States administer their own certification examination or provide the option of taking the NRMET examination. To maintain certification, EMTs and paramedics must reregister, usually every 2 years. In order to re-register, an individual must be working as an EMT or paramedic and meet a continuing education requirement. Training is offered at progressive levels: EMT-Basic, also known as EMT-1; EMT-Intermediate, or EMT-2 and EMT-3; and EMTparamedic, or EMT-4. The EMT-Basic represents the first level of skills required to work in the emergency medical system. Coursework typically emphasizes emergency skills such as managing respiratory, trauma, and cardiac emergencies and patient assessment. Formal courses are often combined with time in an emergency room or ambulance. The program also provides instruction and practice in dealing with bleeding, fractures, airway obstruction, cardiac arrest, and emergency childbirth. Students learn to use and maintain common emergency equipment, such as backboards, suction devices, splints, oxygen delivery systems, and stretchers. Graduates of approved EMT basic training programs who pass a written and practical examination administered by the State certifying agency or the NREMT earn the title of Registered EMT-Basic. The course also is a prerequisite for EMT-Intermediate and EMT-Paramedic training. EMT-Intermediate training requirements vary from State to State. Applicants can opt to receive training in EMT-Shock Trauma, where the caregiver learns to start intravenous fluids and give certain medications, or in EMT-Cardiac, which includes learning heart rhythms 14  and administering advanced medications. Training commonly includes 35 to 55 hours of additional instruction beyond EMT-Basic coursework and covers patient assessment, as well as the use of advanced airway devices and intravenous fluids. Prerequisites for taking the EMT-Intermediate examination include registration as an EMT-Basic, required classroom work, and a specified amount of clinical experience. The most advanced level of training for this occupation is EMTParamedic. At this level, the caregiver receives additional training in body function and more advanced skills. The Paramedic Technology program usually lasts up to 2 years and results in an associate degree in applied science. Such education prepares the graduate to take the NREMT examination and become certified as an EMTParamedic. Extensive related coursework and clinical and field experience is required. Due to the longer training requirement, almost all EMT-Paramedics are in paid positions. Refresher courses and continuing education are available for EMTs and paramedics at all levels. EMTs and paramedics should be emotionally stable, have good dexterity, agility, and physical coordination, and be able to lift and carry heavy loads. They also need good eyesight (corrective lenses may be used) with accurate color vision. Advancement beyond the EMT-Paramedic level usually means leaving fieldwork. An EMT-Paramedic can become a supervisor, operations manager, administrative director, or executive director of emergency services. Some EMTs and paramedics become instructors, dispatchers, or physician assistants, while others move into sales or marketing of emergency medical equipment. A number of people become EMTs and paramedics to assess their interest in healthcare and then decide to return to school and become registered nurses, physicians, or other health workers. Job Outlook Employment of emergency medical technicians and paramedics is expected to grow faster than the average for all occupations through 2010. Population growth and urbanization will increase the demand for full-time paid EMTs and paramedics rather than for volunteers. In addition, a large segment of the population--the aging baby boomers--will further spur demand for EMT services, as they become more likely to have medical emergencies. There will still be demand for part-time, volunteer EMTs and paramedics in rural areas and smaller metropolitan areas. In addition to job growth, openings will occur because of replacement needs; some workers leave because of stressful working conditions, limited advancement potential, and the modest pay and benefits in the private sector. Most opportunities for EMTs and paramedics are expected to arise in hospitals and private ambulance services. Competition will be greater for jobs in local government, including fire, police, and independent third service rescue squad departments, where salaries and benefits tend to be slightly better. Opportunities will be best for those who have advanced certifications, such as EMT-Intermediate and EMT-Paramedic, as clients and patients demand higher levels of care before arriving at the hospital. Earnings Earnings of EMTs and paramedics depend on the employment setting and geographic location as well as the individual's training and experience. Median annual earnings of EMTs and paramedics were $22,460 in 2000. The middle 50 percent earned between $17,930 and $29,270. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $14,660, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $37,760. Median annual earnings in the industries employing the largest numbers of EMTs and paramedics in 2000 were:   Local government ....................................................................... $24,800 Hospitals ..................................................................................... 23,590 Local and suburban transportation .............................................. 20,950  Those in emergency medical services who are part of fire or police departments receive the same benefits as firefighters or police officers. For example, many are covered by pension plans that provide retirement at half pay after 20 or 25 years of service or if disabled in the line of duty. Related Occupations Other workers in occupations that require quick and level-headed reactions to life-or-death situations are air traffic controllers, firefighting occupations, physician assistants, police and detectives, and registered nurses.

LPNs who work in private homes also may prepare meals and teach family members simple nursing tasks. Working Conditions Most licensed practical nurses in hospitals and nursing homes work a 40-hour week, but because patients need around-the-clock care, some work nights, weekends, and holidays. They often stand for long periods and help patients move in bed, stand, or walk. LPNs may face hazards from caustic chemicals, radiation, and infectious diseases such as hepatitis. They are subject to back injuries when moving patients and shock from electrical equipment. They often must deal with the stress of heavy workloads. In addition, the patients they care for may be confused, irrational, agitated, or uncooperative. Employment Licensed practical nurses held about 700,000 jobs in 2000. Twentynine percent of LPNs worked in nursing homes, 28 percent worked in hospitals, and 14 percent in physicians' offices and clinics. Others worked for home healthcare services, residential care facilities, schools, temporary help agencies, or government agencies; about 1 in 5 worked part time. Training, Other Qualifications, and Advancement All States and the District of Columbia require LPNs to pass a licensing examination after completing a State-approved practical nursing program. A high school diploma, or equivalent, usually is required for entry, although some programs accept candidates without a diploma or are designed as part of a high school curriculum. In 2000, approximately 1,100 State-approved programs provided practical nursing training. Almost 6 out of 10 students were enrolled in technical or vocational schools, while 3 out of 10 were in community and junior colleges. Others were in high schools, hospitals, and colleges and universities. Most practical nursing programs last about 1 year and include both classroom study and supervised clinical practice (patient care). Classroom study covers basic nursing concepts and patient-care related subjects, including anatomy, physiology, medical-surgical nursing, pediatrics, obstetrics, psychiatric nursing, administration of drugs, nutrition, and first aid. Clinical practice usually is in a hospital, but sometimes includes other settings. 15  Licensed Practical and Licensed Vocational Nurses (O*NET 29-2061.00)  !  ! !  Significant Points Training lasting about 1 year is available in about 1,100 State-approved programs, mostly in vocational or technical schools. Nursing homes will offer the most new jobs. Job seekers in hospitals may face competition as the number of hospital jobs for LPNs declines.  Nature of the Work Licensed practical nurses (LPNs), or licensed vocational nurses (LVNs) as they are called in Texas and California, care for the sick, injured, convalescent, and disabled under the direction of physicians and registered nurses. (The work of physicians and surgeons and registered nurses is described elsewhere in the Handbook.) Most LPNs provide basic bedside care. They take vital signs such as temperature, blood pressure, pulse, and respiration. They also treat bedsores, prepare and give injections and enemas, apply dressings, give alcohol rubs and massages, apply ice packs and hot water bottles, and monitor catheters. LPNs observe patients and report adverse reactions to medications or treatments. They collect samples for testing, perform routine laboratory tests, feed patients, and record food and fluid intake and output. They help patients with bathing, dressing, and personal hygiene, keep them comfortable, and care for their emotional needs. In States where the law allows, they may administer prescribed medicines or start intravenous fluids. Some LPNs help deliver, care for, and feed infants. Experienced LPNs may supervise nursing assistants and aides. LPNs in nursing homes provide routine bedside care, help evaluate residents' needs, develop care plans, and supervise the care provided by nursing aides. In doctors' offices and clinics, they also   LPNs should have a caring, sympathetic nature. They should be emotionally stable because work with the sick and injured can be stressful. They also should have keen observational, decision making, and communication skills. As part of a healthcare team, they must be able to follow orders and work under close supervision. Job Outlook Employment of LPNs is expected to grow about as fast as the average for all occupations through 2010 in response to the long-term care needs of a rapidly growing elderly population and the general growth of healthcare. Replacement needs will be a major source of job openings, as many workers leave the occupation permanently. Employment of LPNs in nursing homes is expected to grow faster than the average. Nursing homes will offer the most new jobs for LPNs as the number of aged and disabled persons in need of longterm care rises. In addition to caring for the aged and disabled, nursing homes will be called on to care for the increasing number of patients who have been discharged from the hospital but who have not recovered enough to return home. LPNs seeking positions in hospitals may face competition, as the number of hospital jobs for LPNs declines. An increasing proportion of sophisticated procedures, which once were performed only in hospitals, are being performed in physicians' offices and clinics, including ambulatory surgicenters and emergency medical centers, due largely to advances in technology. As a result, employment of LPNs is projected to grow much faster than average in these places as healthcare expands outside the traditional hospital setting. Employment of LPNs is expected to grow much faster than average in home healthcare services. This is in response to a growing number of older persons with functional disabilities, consumer preference for care in the home, and technological advances, which make it possible to bring increasingly complex treatments into the home. Earnings Median annual earnings of licensed practical nurses were $29,440 in 2000. The middle 50 percent earned between $24,920 and $34,800. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $21,520, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $41,800. Median annual earnings in the industries employing the largest numbers of licensed practical nurses in 2000 were as follows: Personnel supply services ........................................................... $35,750 Home health care services .......................................................... 31,220 Nursing and personal care facilities ............................................ 29,980 Hospitals ..................................................................................... 28,450 Offices and clinics of medical doctors ........................................ 27,520  Medical Assistants (O*NET 31-9092.00)  ! !  Significant Points Medical assistants is expected to be one of the fastest growing occupations through the year 2010. Job prospects should be best for medical assistants with formal training or experience.  Nature of the Work Medical assistants perform routine administrative and clinical tasks to keep the offices and clinics of physicians, podiatrists, chiropractors, and optometrists running smoothly. They should not be confused with physician assistants who examine, diagnose, and treat patients under the direct supervision of a physician. (Physician assistants are discussed elsewhere in the Handbook.) The duties of medical assistants vary from office to office, depending on office location, size, and specialty. In small practices, medical assistants usually are ""generalists,"" handling both administrative and clinical duties and reporting directly to an office manager, physician, or other health practitioner. Those in large practices tend to specialize in a particular area under the supervision of department administrators. Medical assistants perform many administrative duties. They answer telephones, greet patients, update and file patient medical records, fill out insurance forms, handle correspondence, schedule appointments, arrange for hospital admission and laboratory services, and handle billing and bookkeeping. Clinical duties vary according to State law and include taking medical histories and recording vital signs, explaining treatment procedures to patients, preparing patients for examination, and assisting the physician during the examination. Medical assistants collect and prepare laboratory specimens or perform basic laboratory tests on the premises, dispose of contaminated supplies, and sterilize medical instruments. They instruct patients about medication and special diets, prepare and administer medications as directed by a physician, authorize drug refills as directed, telephone prescriptions to a pharmacy, draw blood, prepare patients for x rays, take electrocardiograms, remove sutures, and change dressings. Medical assistants also may arrange examining room instruments and equipment, purchase and maintain supplies and equipment, and keep waiting and examining rooms neat and clean.  Related Occupations LPNs work closely with people while helping them. So do emergency medical technicians and paramedics, social and human service assistants, surgical technologists, and teacher assistants.

The duties of medical assistants vary from office to office, depending on office location, size, and specialty.  16   Assistants who specialize have additional duties. Podiatric medical assistants make castings of feet, expose and develop x rays, and assist podiatrists in surgery. Ophthalmic medical assistants help ophthalmologists provide medical eye care. They conduct diagnostic tests, measure and record vision, and test eye muscle function. They also show patients how to insert, remove, and care for contact lenses; and they apply eye dressings. Under the direction of the physician, they may administer eye medications. They also maintain optical and surgical instruments and may assist the ophthalmologist in surgery. Working Conditions Medical assistants work in well-lighted, clean environments. They constantly interact with other people, and may have to handle several responsibilities at once. Most full-time medical assistants work a regular 40-hour week. Some work part-time, evenings, or weekends. Employment Medical assistants held about 329,000 jobs in 2000. Sixty percent were in physicians' offices, and about 15 percent were in hospitals, including inpatient and outpatient facilities. The rest were in nursing homes, offices of other health practitioners, and other health care facilities. Training, Other Qualifications, and Advancement Most employers prefer graduates of formal programs in medical assisting. Such programs are offered in vocational-technical high schools, postsecondary vocational schools, community and junior colleges, and in colleges and universities. Postsecondary programs usually last either 1 year, resulting in a certificate or diploma, or 2 years, resulting in an associate degree. Courses cover anatomy, physiology, and medical terminology as well as typing, transcription, recordkeeping, accounting, and insurance processing. Students learn laboratory techniques, clinical and diagnostic procedures, pharmaceutical principles, medication administration, and first aid. They study office practices, patient relations, medical law, and ethics. Accredited programs include an internship that provides practical experience in physicians' offices, hospitals, or other healthcare facilities. Two agencies recognized by the U.S. Department of Education accredit programs in medical assisting: the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs (CAAHEP) and the Accrediting Bureau of Health Education Schools (ABHES). In 2001, there were about 500 medical assisting programs accredited by CAAHEP and about 170 accredited by ABHES. The Committee on Accreditation for Ophthalmic Medical Personnel approved 14 programs in ophthalmic medical assisting. Formal training in medical assisting, while generally preferred, is not always required. Some medical assistants are trained on the job, although this is less common than in the past. Applicants usually need a high school diploma or the equivalent. Recommended high school courses include mathematics, health, biology, typing, bookkeeping, computers, and office skills. Volunteer experience in the healthcare field also is helpful. Although there is no licensing for medical assistants, some States require them to take a test or a course before they can perform certain tasks, such as taking x rays. Employers prefer to hire experienced workers or certified applicants who have passed a national examination, indicating that the medical assistant meets certain standards of competence. The American Association of Medical Assistants awards the Certified Medical Assistant credential; the American Medical Technologists awards the Registered Medical Assistant credential; the American Society of Podiatric Medical  Assistants awards the Podiatric Medical Assistant Certified credential; and the Joint Commission on Allied Health Personnel in Ophthalmology awards credentials at three levels--Certified Ophthalmic Assistant, Certified Ophthalmic Technician, and Certified Ophthalmic Medical Technologist. Medical assistants may be able to advance to office manager. They may qualify for a variety of administrative support occupations, or may teach medical assisting. Some, with additional education, enter other health occupations such as nursing and medical technology. Medical assistants deal with the public; therefore, they must be neat and well-groomed and have a courteous, pleasant manner. Medical assistants must be able to put patients at ease and explain physicians' instructions. They must respect the confidential nature of medical information. Clinical duties require a reasonable level of manual dexterity and visual acuity. Job Outlook Employment of medical assistants is expected to grow much faster than the average for all occupations through the year 2010 as the health services industry expands because of technological advances in medicine, and a growing and aging population. It is one of the fastest growing occupations. Employment growth will be driven by the increase in the number of group practices, clinics, and other healthcare facilities that need a high proportion of support personnel, particularly the flexible medical assistant who can handle both administrative and clinical duties. Medical assistants primarily work in outpatient settings, where much faster than average growth is expected. In view of the preference of many health care employers for trained personnel, job prospects should be best for medical assistants with formal training or experience, particularly those with certification. Earnings The earnings of medical assistants vary, depending on experience, skill level, and location. Median annual earnings of medical assistants were $23,000 in 2000. The middle 50 percent earned between $19,460 and $27,460 a year. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $16,700, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $32,850 a year. Median annual earnings in the industries employing the largest number of medical assistants in 2000 were as follows: Offices and clinics of medical doctors ........................................ $23,610 Hospitals ..................................................................................... 22,950 Health and allied services, not elsewhere classified ................... 22,860 Offices of osteopathic physicians ............................................... 21,420 Offices of other health practitioners ........................................... 20,860  Related Occupations Workers in other medical support occupations include dental assistants, medical records and health information technicians, medical secretaries, occupational therapist assistants and aides, pharmacy aides, and physical therapist assistants and aides.

Medical Records and Health Information Technicians (O*NET 29-2071.00)  ! !  !  Significant Points Medical records and health information technicians are projected to be one of the fastest growing occupations. High school students can improve chances of acceptance into a medical record and health information education program by taking anatomy, physiology, medical terminology, and computer courses. Most technicians will be employed by hospitals, but job growth will be faster in offices and clinics of physicians, nursing homes, and home health agencies.  The duties of medical records and health information technicians vary with the size of the facility. statement on medical and health services managers elsewhere in the Handbook.) In small facilities, a credentialed medical records and health information technician sometimes manages the department. Working Conditions Medical records and health information technicians usually work a 40-hour week. Some overtime may be required. In hospitals-- where health information departments often are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week--technicians may work day, evening, and night shifts. Medical records and health information technicians work in pleasant and comfortable offices. This is one of the few health occupations in which there is little or no physical contact with patients. Because accuracy is essential, technicians must pay close attention to detail. Technicians who work at computer monitors for prolonged periods must guard against eyestrain and muscle pain. Employment Medical records and health information technicians held about 136,000 jobs in 2000. About 4 out of 10 jobs were in hospitals. The rest were mostly in nursing homes, medical group practices, clinics, and home health agencies. Insurance firms that deal in health matters employ a small number of health information technicians to tabulate and analyze health information. Public health departments also hire technicians to supervise data collection from health care institutions and to assist in research. Training, Other Qualifications, and Advancement Medical records and health information technicians entering the field usually have an associate degree from a community or junior college. In addition to general education, coursework includes medical terminology, anatomy and physiology, legal aspects of health information, coding and abstraction of data, statistics, database management, quality improvement methods, and computer training. Applicants can improve their chances of admission into a program by taking biology, chemistry, health, and computer courses in high school. Hospitals sometimes advance promising health information clerks to jobs as medical records and health information technicians, although this practice may be less common in the future. Advancement usually requires 2 to 4 years of job experience and completion of a hospital's in-house training program. Most employers prefer to hire Registered Health Information Technicians (RHIT), who must pass a written examination offered  Nature of the Work Every time health care personnel treat a patient, they record what they observed, and how the patient was treated medically. This record includes information the patient provides concerning their symptoms and medical history, the results of examinations, reports of x rays and laboratory tests, diagnoses, and treatment plans. Medical records and health information technicians organize and evaluate these records for completeness and accuracy. Medical records and health information technicians begin to assemble patients' health information by first making sure their initial medical charts are complete. They ensure all forms are completed and properly identified and signed, and all necessary information is in the computer. Sometimes, they communicate with physicians or others to clarify diagnoses or get additional information. Technicians assign a code to each diagnosis and procedure. They consult classification manuals and rely, also, on their knowledge of disease processes. Technicians then use a software program to assign the patient to one of several hundred ""diagnosis-related groups,"" or DRG's. The DRG determines the amount the hospital will be reimbursed if the patient is covered by Medicare or other insurance programs using the DRG system. Technicians who specialize in coding are called health information coders, medical record coders, coder/ abstractors, or coding specialists. In addition to the DRG system, coders use other coding systems, such as those geared towards ambulatory settings. Technicians also use computer programs to tabulate and analyze data to help improve patient care, control costs, for use in legal actions, in response to surveys, or for use in research studies. Tumor registrars compile and maintain records of patients who have cancer to provide information to physicians and for research studies. Medical records and health information technicians' duties vary with the size of the facility. In large to medium facilities, technicians may specialize in one aspect of health information, or supervise health information clerks and transcriptionists while a medical records and health information administrator manages the department. (See the 18   by AHIMA. To take the examination, a person must graduate from a 2-year associate degree program accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs (CAAHEP) of the American Medical Association. Technicians trained in nonCAAHEP accredited programs, or on the job, are not eligible to take the examination. In 2001, CAAHEP accredited 177 programs for health information technicians. Technicians who specialize in coding may also obtain voluntary certification. Experienced medical records and health information technicians usually advance in one of two ways--by specializing or managing. Many senior technicians specialize in coding, particularly Medicare coding, or in tumor registry. In large medical records and health information departments, experienced technicians may advance to section supervisor, overseeing the work of the coding, correspondence, or discharge sections, for example. Senior technicians with RHIT credentials may become director or assistant director of a medical records and health information department in a small facility. However, in larger institutions, the director is usually an administrator, with a bachelor 's degree in medical records and health information administration. (See the statement on health services managers elsewhere in the Handbook.) Job Outlook Job prospects for formally trained technicians should be very good. Employment of medical records and health information technicians is expected to grow much faster than the average for all occupations through 2010, due to rapid growth in the number of medical tests, treatments, and procedures which will be increasingly scrutinized by third-party payers, regulators, courts, and consumers. Hospitals will continue to employ a large percentage of health information technicians, but growth will not be as fast as in other areas. Increasing demand for detailed records in offices and clinics of physicians should result in fast employment growth, especially in large group practices. Rapid growth is also expected in nursing homes and home health agencies. Earnings Median annual earnings of medical records and health information technicians were $22,750 in 2000. The middle 50 percent earned between $18,700 and $28,590. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $15,710, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $35,170. Median annual earnings in the industries employing the largest numbers of medical records and health information technicians in 2000 were as follows: Nursing and personal care facilities ............................................ $23,760 Hospitals ..................................................................................... 23,540 Offices and clinics of medical doctors ........................................ 21,090  Medical Transcriptionists (O*NET 31-9094.00)  Significant Points ! Employers prefer medical transcriptionists who have completed a vocational school or community college program. Employment is projected to grow faster than average due to increasing demand for medical transcription services. Some medical transcriptionists enjoy the flexibility of working at home, especially those with previous experience in a hospital or clinic setting.  !  !  Related Occupations Medical records and health information technicians need a strong clinical background to analyze the contents of medical records. Workers in other occupations requiring knowledge of medical terminology, anatomy, and physiology without physical contact with the patient are medical secretaries and medical transcriptionists.

American Health Information Management Association, 233 N. Michigan Ave., Suite 2150, Chicago, IL 60601-5800. Internet: http://www.ahima.org  Nature of the Work Medical transcriptionists, also called medical transcribers and medical stenographers, listen to dictated recordings made by physicians and other healthcare professionals and transcribe them into medical reports, correspondence, and other administrative material. They generally listen to recordings on a special headset, using a foot pedal to pause the recording when necessary, and key the text into a personal computer or word processor, editing as necessary for grammar and clarity. The documents they produce include discharge summaries, history and physical examination reports, operating room reports, consultation reports, autopsy reports, diagnostic imaging studies, and referral letters. Medical transcriptionists return transcribed documents to the dictator for review and signature, or correction. These documents eventually become part of patients' permanent files. To understand and accurately transcribe dictated reports into a format that is clear and comprehensible for the reader, medical transcriptionists must understand medical terminology, anatomy and physiology, diagnostic procedures, and treatment. They also must be able to translate medical jargon and abbreviations into their expanded forms. To help identify terms appropriately, transcriptionists refer to standard medical reference materials--both printed and electronic; some of these are available over the Internet. Medical transcriptionists must comply with specific standards that apply to the style of medical records, in addition to the legal and ethical requirements involved with keeping patient records confidential. Experienced transcriptionists spot mistakes or inconsistencies in a medical report and check back with the dictator to correct the information. Their ability to understand and correctly transcribe patient assessments and treatments reduces the chance of patients receiving ineffective or even harmful treatments and ensures high quality patient care. Currently, most healthcare providers transmit dictation to medical transcriptionists using either digital or analog dictating equipment. With the emergence of the Internet, some transcriptionists receive dictation over the Internet and are able to quickly return transcribed documents to clients for approval. As confidentiality concerns are resolved, this practice will become more prevalent. Another emerging trend is the implementation of speech recognition technology, which electronically translates sound into text and creates drafts of reports. Reports are then formatted; edited for mistakes in translation, punctuation, or grammar; and checked for consistency and possible medical errors. Transcriptionists working in specialized areas with more standard terminology, such as radiology or pathology, are more likely to encounter speech recognition technology. However, use of speech recognition technology will become more widespread as the technology becomes more sophisticated. 19   Employment Medical transcriptionists held about 102,000 jobs in 2000. About 2 out of 5 worked in hospitals and about another 2 out of 5 in physicians' offices and clinics. Others worked for laboratories, colleges and universities, transcription services, and temporary help agencies. Training, Other Qualifications, and Advancement Employers prefer to hire transcriptionists who have completed postsecondary training in medical transcription, offered by many vocational schools, community colleges, and distance-learning programs. Completion of a 2-year associate degree or 1-year certificate program--including coursework in anatomy, medical terminology, medicolegal issues, and English grammar and punctuation--is highly recommended, but not always required. Many of these programs include supervised on-the-job experience. Some transcriptionists, especially those already familiar with medical terminology due to previous experience as a nurse or medical secretary, become proficient through on-the-job training. The American Association for Medical Transcription (AAMT) awards the voluntary designation, Certified Medical Transcriptionist (CMT), to those who earn passing scores on written and practical examinations. As in many other fields, certification is recognized as a sign of competence. Because medical terminology is constantly evolving, medical transcriptionists are encouraged to regularly update their skills. Every 3 years, CMTs must earn continuing education credits to be recertified. In addition to understanding medical terminology, transcriptionists must have good English grammar and punctuation skills, as well as familiarity with personal computers and word processing software. Normal hearing acuity and good listening skills also are necessary. Employers often require applicants to take pre-employment tests. With experience, medical transcriptionists can advance to supervisory positions, home-based work, consulting, or teaching. With additional education or training, some become medical records and health information technicians, medical coders, or medical records and health information administrators. Job Outlook Employment of medical transcriptionists is projected to grow faster than the average for all occupations through 2010. Demand for medical transcription services will be spurred by a growing and aging population. Older age groups receive proportionately greater numbers of medical tests, treatments, and procedures that require documentation. A high level of demand for transcription services also will be sustained by the continued need for electronic documentation that can be easily shared among providers, third-party payers, regulators, and consumers. Growing numbers of medical transcriptionists will be needed to amend patients' records, edit for grammar, and discover discrepancies in medical records. Advancements in speech recognition technology are not projected to significantly reduce the need for medical transcriptionists because these workers will continue to be needed to review and edit drafts for accuracy. In spite of the advances in this technology, it has been difficult for the software to grasp and analyze the human voice and the English language with all its diversity. There will continue to be a need for skilled medical transcriptionists to identify and appropriately edit the inevitable errors created by speech recognition systems, and create a final document. Hospitals will continue to employ a large percentage of medical transcriptionists, but job growth will not be as fast as in other areas. Increasing demand for standardized records in offices and clinics of physicians should result in rapid employment growth, especially in large group practices. Job opportunities should be the best for  Transcriptionists use medical reference materials to ensure that medical terms are correctly identified. Medical transcriptionists who work in physicians' offices and clinics may have other office duties, such as receiving patients, scheduling appointments, answering the telephone, and handling incoming and outgoing mail. Medical secretaries, discussed elsewhere in the Handbook, may also transcribe as part of their jobs. Court reporters, also discussed elsewhere in the Handbook, have similar duties, but with a different focus. They take verbatim reports of speeches, conversations, legal proceedings, meetings, and other events when written accounts of spoken words are necessary for correspondence, records, or legal proof. Working Conditions The majority of these workers are employed in comfortable settings, such as hospitals, physicians' offices, clinics, laboratories, medical libraries, government medical facilities, or at home. An increasing number of medical transcriptionists telecommute from home-based offices as employees or subcontractors for hospitals and transcription services or as self-employed independent contractors. Work in this occupation presents few hazards, although sitting in the same position for long periods can be tiring, and workers can suffer wrist, back, neck, or eye problems due to strain and risk repetitive motion injuries such as carpal tunnel syndrome. The pressure to be accurate and fast also can be stressful. Many medical transcriptionists work a standard 40-hour week. Self-employed medical transcriptionists are more likely to work irregular hours--including part time, evenings, weekends, or on an on-call basis. 20   those who earn an associate degree or certification from the American Association for Medical Transcription.

Hospitals ..................................................................................... Mailing, reproduction, and stenographic services ....................... $12.25 12.14 11.47  Compensation methods for medical transcriptionists vary. Some are paid based on the number of hours they work or on the number of lines they transcribe. Others receive a base pay per hour with incentives for extra production. Large hospitals and healthcare organizations usually prefer to pay for the time an employee works. Independent contractors and employees of transcription services almost always receive production-based pay. According to a 1999 study conducted by Hay Management Consultants for the American Association for Medical Transcription, entry-level medical transcriptionists had median hourly earnings of $10.32 and the most experienced transcriptionists had median hourly earnings of $13.00. Earnings were highest in organizations employing 1,000 or more workers. Transcriptionists receiving production-based pay earned about 7 to 8.5 cents per Standardized Line (based on a 65-character line, counting all keystrokes). However, independent contractors--who have higher expenses than their corporate counterparts, receive no benefits, and face higher risk of termination than employed transcriptionists--typically charge about 12 to 13 cents per Standardized Line. Related Occupations A number of other workers type, record information, and process paperwork. Among these are court reporters, secretaries and administrative assistants, receptionists and information clerks, and human resources assistants, except payroll and timekeeping. Other workers who provide medical support include medical assistants and medical records and health information technicians.

Internet: http://www.aamt.org  Nature of the Work In nuclear medicine, radionuclides--unstable atoms that emit radiation spontaneously--are used to diagnose and treat disease. Radionuclides are purified and compounded like other drugs to form radiopharmaceuticals. Nuclear medicine technologists administer these radiopharmaceuticals to patients, then monitor the characteristics and functions of tissues or organs in which they localize. Abnormal areas show higher or lower concentrations of radioactivity than normal. Nuclear medicine technologists operate cameras that detect and map the radioactive drug in the patient's body to create an image on photographic film or a computer monitor. Radiologic technologists and technicians also operate diagnostic imaging equipment, but their equipment creates an image by projecting an x ray through the patient. (See the statement on radiologic technologists and technicians elsewhere in the Handbook.) Nuclear medicine technologists explain test procedures to patients. They prepare a dosage of the radiopharmaceutical and administer it by mouth, injection, or other means. When preparing radiopharmaceuticals, technologists adhere to safety standards that keep the radiation dose to workers and patients as low as possible. Technologists position patients and start a gamma scintillation camera, or ""scanner,"" which creates images of the distribution of a radiopharmaceutical as it localizes in and emits signals from the patient's body. Technologists produce the images on a computer screen or on film for a physician to interpret. Some nuclear medicine studies, such as cardiac function studies, are processed with the aid of a computer. Nuclear medicine technologists also perform radioimmunoassay studies that assess the behavior of a radioactive substance inside the body. For example, technologists may add radioactive substances to blood or serum to determine levels of hormones or therapeutic drug content. Technologists keep patient records and record the amount and type of radionuclides received, used, and disposed of.  State employment service offices can provide information about job openings for medical transcriptionists.  Nuclear Medicine Technologists (O*NET 29-2033.00)  !  !  Significant Points Faster-than-average growth will arise from an increase in the number of middle-aged and elderly persons, who are the primary users of diagnostic procedures. Technologists with cross training in radiologic technology or other modalities will have the best prospects.  A nuclear medical technologist can view images of tissues or organs on a computer monitor. 21   Working Conditions Nuclear medicine technologists generally work a 40-hour week. This may include evening or weekend hours in departments that operate on an extended schedule. Opportunities for part-time and shift work are also available. In addition, technologists in hospitals may have on-call duty on a rotational basis. Because technologists are on their feet much of the day, and may lift or turn disabled patients, physical stamina is important. Although there is potential for radiation exposure in this field, it is kept to a minimum by the use of shielded syringes, gloves, and other protective devices and adherence to strict radiation safety guidelines. Technologists also wear badges that measure radiation levels. Because of safety programs, however, badge measurements rarely exceed established safety levels. Employment Nuclear medicine technologists held about 18,000 jobs in 2000. About two-thirds of all jobs were in hospitals. The rest were in physicians' offices and clinics, including diagnostic imaging centers. Training, Other Qualifications, and Advancement Nuclear medicine technology programs range in length from 1 to 4 years and lead to a certificate, associate's degree, or bachelor 's degree. Generally, certificate programs are offered in hospitals, associate programs in community colleges, and bachelor 's programs in 4-year colleges and in universities. Courses cover physical sciences, the biological effects of radiation exposure, radiation protection and procedures, the use of radiopharmaceuticals, imaging techniques, and computer applications. One-year certificate programs are for health professionals, especially radiologic technologists and diagnostic medical sonographers, who wish to specialize in nuclear medicine. They also attract medical technologists, registered nurses, and others who wish to change fields or specialize. Others interested in the nuclear medicine technology field have three options: A 2-year certificate program, a 2-year associate program, or a 4-year bachelor 's program. The Joint Review Committee on Education Programs in Nuclear Medicine Technology accredits most formal training programs in nuclear medicine technology. In 2000, there were 95 accredited programs in the continental United States and Puerto Rico. All nuclear medicine technologists must meet the minimum Federal standards on the administration of radioactive drugs and the operation of radiation detection equipment. In addition, about half of all States require technologists to be licensed. Technologists also may obtain voluntary professional certification or registration. Registration or certification is available from the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists and from the Nuclear Medicine Technology Certification Board. Most employers prefer to hire certified or registered technologists. Nuclear medicine technologists should be sensitive to patients' physical and psychological needs. They must pay attention to detail, follow instructions, and work as part of a team. In addition, operating complicated equipment requires mechanical ability and manual dexterity. Technologists may advance to supervisor, then to chief technologist, and to department administrator or director. Some technologists specialize in a clinical area such as nuclear cardiology or computer analysis or leave patient care to take positions in research laboratories. Some become instructors or directors in nuclear medicine technology programs, a step that usually requires a bachelor 's degree or a master 's in nuclear medicine technology. Others leave the occupation to work as sales or training 22  representatives for medical equipment and radiopharmaceutical manufacturing firms, or as radiation safety officers in regulatory agencies or hospitals. Job Outlook Employment of nuclear medicine technologists is expected to grow faster than the average for all occupations through the year 2010. The number of openings each year will be very low because the occupation is small. Growth will arise from an increase in the number of middle-aged and older persons who are the primary users of diagnostic procedures, including nuclear medicine tests. Technological innovations may increase the diagnostic uses of nuclear medicine. One example is the use of radiopharmaceuticals in combination with monoclonal antibodies to detect cancer at far earlier stages than is customary today, and without resorting to surgery. Another is the use of radionuclides to examine the heart's ability to pump blood. Wider use of nuclear medical imaging to observe metabolic and biochemical changes for neurology, cardiology, and oncology procedures, also will spur some demand for nuclear medicine technologists. On the other hand, cost considerations will affect the speed with which new applications of nuclear medicine grow. Some promising nuclear medicine procedures, such as positron emission tomography (PET), are extremely costly, and hospitals contemplating them will have to consider equipment costs, reimbursement policies, and the number of potential users. Earnings Median annual earnings of nuclear medicine technologists were $44,130 in 2000. The middle 50 percent earned between $38,150 and $52,190. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $31,910, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $58,500. Median annual earnings of nuclear medicine technologists in 2000 were $44,000 in hospitals. Related Occupations Nuclear medical technologists operate sophisticated equipment to help physicians and other health practitioners diagnose and treat patients. Cardiovascular technologists and technicians, clinical laboratory technologists and technicians, diagnostic medical sonographers, radiation therapists, radiologic technologists and technicians, and respiratory therapists also perform similar functions.

Significant Points Job prospects for nursing and home health aides will be very good because of fast growth and high replacement needs in these large occupations. Minimum education or training is generally required for entry-level jobs, but earnings are low.  Nature of the Work Nursing and psychiatric aides help care for physically or mentally ill, injured, disabled, or infirm individuals confined to hospitals, nursing and personal care facilities, and mental health settings. Home health aides duties are similar, but they work in patients' homes or residential care facilities. Nursing aides, also known as nursing assistants, geriatric aides, unlicensed assistive personnel, or hospital attendants, perform routine tasks under the supervision of nursing and medical staff. They answer patients' call bells, deliver messages, serve meals, make beds, and help patients eat, dress, and bathe. Aides also may provide skin care to patients; take temperatures, pulse, respiration, and blood pressure; and help patients get in and out of bed and walk. They also may escort patients to operating and examining rooms, keep patients' rooms neat, set up equipment, store and move supplies, or assist with some procedures. Aides observe patients' physical, mental, and emotional conditions and report any change to the nursing or medical staff. Nursing aides employed in nursing homes often are the principal caregivers, having far more contact with residents than other members of the staff. Because some residents may stay in a nursing home for months or even years, aides develop ongoing relationships with them and interact with them in a positive, caring way. Psychiatric aides, also known as mental health assistants or psychiatric nursing assistants, care for mentally impaired or emotionally disturbed individuals. They work under a team that may include psychiatrists, psychologists, psychiatric nurses, social workers, and therapists. In addition to helping patients dress, bathe, groom, and eat, psychiatric aides socialize with them and lead them in educational and recreational activities. Psychiatric aides may play games such as cards with the patients, watch television with them, or participate in group activities such as sports or field trips. They observe patients and report any physical or behavioral signs that might be important for the professional staff to know. They accompany patients to and from examinations and treatments. Because they have such close contact with patients, psychiatric aides can have a great deal of influence on their outlook and treatment. Home health aides help elderly, convalescent, or disabled persons live in their own homes instead of in a health facility. Under the direction of nursing or medical staff, they provide healthrelated services, such as administering oral medications. (Personal and home care aides, who provide mainly housekeeping and routine personal care services, are discussed elsewhere in the Handbook.) Like nursing aides, home health aides may check pulse, temperature, and respiration; help with simple prescribed exercises; keep patients' rooms neat; and help patients move from bed, bathe, dress, and groom. Occasionally, they change nonsterile dressings, give massages and alcohol rubs, or assist with braces and artificial limbs. Experienced home health aides also may assist with medical equipment such as ventilators, which help patients breathe.  Aides help care for physically or mentally ill, injured, disabled, or infirm individuals.  Most home health aides work with elderly or disabled persons who need more extensive care than family or friends can provide. Some help discharged hospital patients who have relatively shortterm needs. In home healthcare agencies, a registered nurse, physical therapist, or social worker usually assigns specific duties and supervises home health aides. Aides keep records of services performed and patients' condition and progress. They report changes in patients' conditions to the supervisor or case manager. Working Conditions Most full-time aides work about 40 hours a week, but because patients need care 24 hours a day, some aides work evenings, nights, weekends, and holidays. Many work part time. Aides spend many hours standing and walking, and they often face heavy workloads. Because they may have to move patients in and out of bed or help them stand or walk, aides must guard against back injury. Aides also may face hazards from minor infections and major diseases, such as hepatitis, but can avoid infections by following proper procedures. Aides often have unpleasant duties, such as emptying bedpans and changing soiled bed linens. The patients they care for may be disoriented, irritable, or uncooperative. Psychiatric aides must be prepared to care for patients whose illness may cause violent behavior. While their work can be emotionally demanding, many aides gain satisfaction from assisting those in need. Home health aides may go to the same patient's home for months or even years. However, most aides work with a number of different patients, each job lasting a few hours, days, or weeks. Home health aides often visit multiple patients on the same day. Home health aides generally work alone, with periodic visits by their supervisor. They receive detailed instructions explaining when to visit patients and what services to perform. Aides are individually responsible for getting to patients' homes, and they may spend a good portion of the working day traveling from one patient to another. Because mechanical lifting devices available in institutional settings are seldom available in patients' homes, home health aides are particularly susceptible to injuries resulting from overexertion when assisting patients. Employment Nursing, psychiatric, and home health aides held about 2.1 million jobs in 2000. Nursing aides held about 1.4 million jobs, home 23   health aides held roughly 615,000 jobs, and psychiatric aides held about 65,000 jobs. About one-half of nursing aides worked in nursing homes, and about one-fourth worked in hospitals. Most home health aides were employed by home health agencies, visiting nurse associations, social services agencies, residential care facilities, and temporary-help firms. Others worked for home health departments of hospitals and nursing facilities, public health agencies, and community volunteer agencies. Most psychiatric aides worked in psychiatric units of general hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, State and county mental institutions, homes for mentally retarded and psychiatric patients, and community mental health centers. Training, Other Qualifications, and Advancement In many cases, neither a high school diploma nor previous work experience is necessary for a job as a nursing, psychiatric, or home health aide. A few employers, however, require some training or experience. Hospitals may require experience as a nursing aide or home health aide. Nursing homes often hire inexperienced workers who must complete a minimum of 75 hours of mandatory training and pass a competency evaluation program within 4 months of employment. Aides who complete the program are certified and placed on the State registry of nursing aides. Some States require psychiatric aides to complete a formal training program. The Federal Government has enacted guidelines for home health aides whose employers receive reimbursement from Medicare. Federal law requires home health aides to pass a competency test covering 12 areas: Communication skills; documentation of patient status and care provided; reading and recording vital signs; basic infection control procedures; basic body functions; maintenance of a healthy environment; emergency procedures; physical, emotional, and developmental characteristics of patients; personal hygiene and grooming; safe transfer techniques; normal range of motion and positioning; and basic nutrition. A home health aide may take training before taking the competency test. Federal law suggests at least 75 hours of classroom and practical training supervised by a registered nurse. Training and testing programs may be offered by the employing agency, but must meet the standards of the Health Care Financing Administration. Training programs vary depending upon State regulations. The National Association for Home Care offers national certification for home health aides. The certification is a voluntary demonstration that the individual has met industry standards. Nursing aide training is offered in high schools, vocational-technical centers, some nursing homes, and some community colleges. Courses cover body mechanics, nutrition, anatomy and physiology, infection control, communication skills, and resident rights. Personal care skills such as how to help patients bathe, eat, and groom also are taught. Some facilities, other than nursing homes, provide classroom instruction for newly hired aides, while others rely exclusively on informal on-the-job instruction from a licensed nurse or an experienced aide. Such training may last several days to a few months. From time to time, aides may also attend lectures, workshops, and in-service training. These occupations can offer individuals an entry into the world of work. The flexibility of night and weekend hours also provides high school and college students a chance to work during the school year. Applicants should be tactful, patient, understanding, healthy, emotionally stable, dependable, and have a desire to help people. They should also be able to work as part of a team, have good communication skills, and be willing to perform repetitive, routine tasks. Home health aides should be honest, and discreet because they work in private homes. 24  Aides must be in good health. A physical examination, including State regulated tests such as those for tuberculosis, may be required. Opportunities for advancement within these occupations are limited. To enter other health occupations, aides generally need additional formal training. Some employers and unions provide opportunities by simplifying the educational paths to advancement. Experience as an aide can also help individuals decide whether to pursue a career in the healthcare field. Job Outlook Overall employment of nursing, psychiatric, and home health aides is projected to grow faster than the average through the year 2010, although individual occupational growth rates vary. Home health aides are expected to grow the fastest, as a result of growing demand for home healthcare from an aging population and efforts to contain healthcare costs by moving patients out of hospitals and nursing facilities as quickly as possible. Consumer preference for care in the home and improvements in medical technologies for inhome treatment also will contribute to much faster than average employment growth for home health aides. Nursing aide employment will not grow as fast as home health aide employment, largely because nursing aides are concentrated in the relatively slower-growing nursing home sector. Nevertheless, employment of nursing aides is expected to grow faster than the average for all occupations in response to increasing emphasis on rehabilitation and the long-term care needs of a rapidly growing elderly population. Financial pressure on hospitals to discharge patients as soon as possible should produce more nursing home admissions. Modern medical technology will also increase the employment of nursing aides. This technology, while saving and extending more lives, increases the need for long-term care provided by aides. Employment of psychiatric aides--the smallest of the three occupations--is expected to grow as fast as the average. The number of jobs for psychiatric aides in hospitals, where one-half of psychiatric aides work, will decline due to attempts to contain costs by limiting inpatient psychiatric treatment. Employment in other sectors will rise in response to growth in the number of older persons-- many of whom will require mental health services, increasing public acceptance of formal treatment for drug abuse and alcoholism, and a lessening of the stigma attached to those receiving mental health care. Numerous openings for nursing and home health aides will arise from a combination of fast growth and high replacement needs for these large occupations. Turnover is high, a reflection of modest entry requirements, low pay, high physical and emotional demands, and lack of advancement opportunities. For these same reasons, many people are unwilling to perform this kind of work. Therefore, persons who are interested in this work and suited for it should have excellent job opportunities. Earnings Median hourly earnings of nursing aides, orderlies, and attendants were $8.89 in 2000. The middle 50 percent earned between $7.51 and $10.59 an hour. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $6.48, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $12.69 an hour. Median hourly earnings in the industries employing the largest numbers of nursing aides, orderlies, and attendants in 2000 were as follows: Personnel supply services ..............................................................

The middle 50 percent earned between $8.38 and $13.02 an hour. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $7.10, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $15.50 an hour. Median hourly earnings of psychiatric aides in 2000 were $12.61 in State government and $10.50 in hospitals. Nursing and psychiatric aides in hospitals generally receive at least 1 week's paid vacation after 1 year of service. Paid holidays and sick leave, hospital and medical benefits, extra pay for lateshift work, and pension plans also are available to many hospital and some nursing home employees. Median hourly earnings of home health aides were $8.23 in 2000. The middle 50 percent earned between $7.13 and $9.88 an hour. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $6.14, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $11.93 an hour.

Internet: http://www.nahc.org  Occupational Health and Safety Specialists and Technicians (O*NET 29-9011.00, 29-9012.00)  !  !  Significant Points Almost half of occupational health and safety specialists and technicians work in Federal, State, and local government agencies that enforce rules on health and safety. For positions as specialists, many employers, including the Federal Government, require 4-year college degrees in safety or a related field.  Nature of the Work Occupational health and safety specialists and technicians, also known as occupational health and safety inspectors and industrial hygienists, help keep workplaces safe and workers unscathed. They promote occupational health and safety within organizations by developing safer, healthier, and more efficient ways of working. (Industrial engineers, including health and safety--who have similar goals--are discussed elsewhere in the Handbook.) Occupational health and safety specialists analyze work environments and design programs to control, eliminate, and prevent disease or injury caused by chemical, physical, and biological agents or ergonomic factors. They may conduct inspections and enforce adherence to laws, regulations, or employer policies governing worker health and safety. Occupational health and safety technicians collect data on work environments for analysis by occupational health and safety specialists. Usually working under the supervision of specialists, they help implement and evaluate programs designed to limit risks to workers. Occupational health and safety specialists and technicians identify hazardous conditions and practices. Sometimes, they develop methods to predict hazards from experience, historical data, and other information sources. Then they identify potential hazards in existing or future systems, equipment, products, facilities, or processes. After reviewing the causes or effects of hazards, they evaluate the probability and severity of accidents that may result. For example, they might uncover patterns in injury data that implicate a specific cause such as system failure, human error, incomplete or faulty decision making, or a weakness in existing policies or practices. Then they develop and help enforce a plan to eliminate hazards, conducting training sessions for management, supervisors, and workers on health and safety practices and regulations, as necessary. Lastly, they may check on the progress of the safety plan after its implementation. If improvements are not satisfactory, a new plan might be designed and put into practice. Many occupational health and safety specialists inspect and test machinery and equipment, such as lifting devices, machine shields, or scaffolding, to ensure they meet appropriate safety regulations. They may check that personal protective equipment, such as masks, respirators, safety glasses, or safety helmets, is being used in workplaces according to regulations. They also check that dangerous materials are stored correctly. They test and identify work areas for potential accident and health hazards, such as toxic fumes and explosive gas-air mixtures, and may implement appropriate control measures, such as adjustments to ventilation systems. Their investigations might involve talking with workers and observing their work, as well as inspecting elements in their work environment, such as lighting, tools, and equipment. To measure and control hazardous substances, such as the noise or radiation levels, occupational health and safety specialists and technicians prepare and calibrate scientific equipment. Samples of dust, gases, vapors, and other potentially toxic materials must be collected and handled properly to ensure safety and accurate test results. If an accident occurs, occupational health and safety specialists help investigate unsafe working conditions, study possible causes, and recommend remedial action. Some occupational health and safety specialists and technicians assist with the rehabilitation of workers after accidents and injuries, and make sure they return to work successfully. Frequent communication with management may be necessary to report on the status of occupational health and safety programs. Consultation with engineers or physicians also may be required. 25   safety specialists and technicians who work to protect agency employees. Most private companies either employ their own safety personnel or contract safety professionals to ensure OSHA compliance, as needed. Training, Other Qualifications, and Advancement Requirements include a combination of education, experience, and passing scores on written examinations. Many employers, including the Federal Government, require a 4-year college degree in safety or a related field for some positions. Experience as a safety professional is also a prerequisite for many positions. All occupational health and safety specialists and technicians are trained in the applicable laws or inspection procedures through some combination of classroom and on-the-job training. In general, people who want to enter this occupation should be responsible and like detailed work. Occupational health and safety specialists and technicians should be able to communicate well. Recommended high school courses include English, chemistry, biology, and physics. Certification is available through the Board of Certified Safety Professionals (BCSP) and the American Board of Industrial Hygiene (ABIH). The BCSP offers the Certified Safety Professional (CSP) credential, while the ABIH proffers the Certified Industrial Hygienist (CIH) credential. Also, the Council on Certification of Health, Environmental, and Safety Technologists, a joint effort between the BCSP and ABIH, awards the Occupational Health and Safety Technologist (OHST) credential. Requirements for the OHST credential are less stringent than those for the CSP or CIH credentials. Once education and experience requirements have been met, certification may be obtained through an examination. Continuing education is required for recertification. Although voluntary, many employers encourage certification. Federal Government occupational health and safety specialists and technicians whose job performance is satisfactory advance through their career ladder to a specified full-performance level. For positions above this level, usually supervisory positions, advancement is competitive and based on agency needs and individual merit. Advancement opportunities in State and local governments and the private sector are often similar to those in the Federal Government. With additional experience or education, promotion to a managerial position is possible. Research or related teaching positions at the college level require advanced education. Job Outlook Employment of occupational health and safety specialists and technicians is expected to grow about as fast as the average for all occupations through 2010, reflecting a balance of continuing public demand for a safe and healthy work environment against the desire for smaller government and fewer regulations. Additional job openings will arise from the need to replace those who transfer to other occupations, retire, or leave the labor force for other reasons. In private industry, employment growth will reflect industry growth and the continuing self-enforcement of government and company regulations and policies. Employment of occupational health and safety specialists and technicians is seldom affected by general economic fluctuations. Federal, State, and local governments, which employ almost half of all specialists and technicians, provide considerable job security.  Almost half of occupational health and safety specialists and technicians work for Federal, State, or local government agencies.  Occupational health and safety specialists prepare reports including observations, analysis of contaminants, and recommendation for control and correction of hazards. Those who develop expertise in certain areas may develop occupational health and safety systems, including policies, procedures, and manuals. Working Conditions Occupational health and safety specialists and technicians work with many different people in a variety of environments. Their jobs often involve considerable fieldwork, and some travel frequently. Many occupational health and safety specialists and technicians work long and often irregular hours. Occupational health and safety specialists and technicians may experience unpleasant, stressful, and dangerous working conditions. For example, health and safety inspectors are exposed to many of the same physically strenuous conditions and hazards as industrial employees, and the work may be performed in unpleasant, stressful, and dangerous working conditions. Health and safety inspectors may find themselves in adversarial roles when the organization or individual being inspected objects to the process or its consequences. Employment Occupational health and safety specialists and technicians held about 35,000 jobs in 2000. The Federal Government--chiefly the Department of Labor--employed 8 percent, State governments employed 17 percent, and local governments employed 19 percent. The remainder were employed throughout the private sector in schools, hospitals, management consulting firms, public utilities, and manufacturing firms. Within the Federal government, most jobs are as Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) inspectors, who enforce U.S. Department of Labor regulations that ensure adequate safety principles, practices, and techniques are applied in workplaces. Employers may be fined for violation of OSHA standards. Within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, occupational health and safety specialists working for the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) provide private companies with an avenue to evaluate the health and safety of their employees without the risk of being fined. Most large government agencies also employ occupational health and 26   Earnings Median annual earnings of occupational health and safety specialists and technicians were $42,750 in 2000. The middle 50 percent earned between $32,060 and $54,880. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $23,780, while the highest 10 percent earned over $67,760. Median annual earnings of occupational health and safety specialists and technicians in 2000 were $41,330 in local government and $41,110 in State government. Most occupational health and safety specialists and technicians work for Federal, State, and local governments or in large private firms, most of which generally offer more generous benefits than do smaller firms. Related Occupations Occupational health and safety specialists and technicians ensure that laws and regulations are obeyed. Others who enforce laws and regulations include agricultural inspectors, construction and building inspectors, correctional officers, financial examiners, fire inspectors, police and detectives, and transportation inspectors.

Significant Points Certified occupational therapist assistants must complete an associate's degree or certificate program. In contrast, occupational therapist aides usually receive most of their training on the job.

Internet: http://www.cchest.org  Nature of the Work Occupational therapist assistants and aides work under the direction of occupational therapists to provide rehabilitative services to persons with mental, physical, emotional, or developmental impairments. The ultimate goal is to improve clients' quality of life by helping them compensate for limitations. For example, occupational therapist assistants help injured workers reenter the labor force by helping them improve their motor skills or help persons with learning disabilities increase their independence, by teaching them to prepare meals or use public transportation. Occupational therapist assistants help clients with rehabilitative activities and exercises outlined in a treatment plan developed in collaboration with an occupational therapist. Activities range from teaching the proper method of moving from a bed into a wheelchair, to the best way to stretch and limber the muscles of the hand. Assistants monitor an individual's activities to make sure they are performed correctly and to provide encouragement. They also record their client's progress for use by the occupational therapist. If the treatment is not having the intended effect, or the client is not improving as expected, the therapist may alter the treatment program in hopes of obtaining better results. In addition, occupational therapist assistants document billing of the client's health insurance provider.  For additional career information, contact: !

An occupational therapist assistant helps a patient restore mobility in her hand. 27   Occupational therapist aides typically prepare materials and assemble equipment used during treatment and are responsible for a range of clerical tasks. Duties can include scheduling appointments, answering the telephone, restocking or ordering depleted supplies, and filling out insurance forms or other paperwork. Aides are not licensed, so by law they are not allowed to perform as wide a range of tasks as occupational therapist assistants. Working Conditions The hours and days that occupational therapist assistants and aides work vary, depending on the facility and whether they are full or part-time employees. Many outpatient therapy offices and clinics have evening and weekend hours, to help coincide with patients' personal schedules. Occupational therapist assistants and aides need to have a moderate degree of strength, due to the physical exertion required in assisting patients with their treatment. For example, in some cases, assistants and aides need to help lift patients. Additionally, constant kneeling, stooping, and standing for long periods all are part of the job. Employment Occupational therapist assistants and aides held 25,000 jobs in 2000. Occupational therapist assistants held about 17,000 jobs, and occupational therapist aides held about 8,500. About 30 percent of assistants and aides worked in hospitals, 25 percent worked in offices of occupational therapists, and 20 percent in nursing and personal care facilities. The remainder primarily worked in offices and clinics of physicians, social services agencies, outpatient rehabilitation centers, and home health agencies. Training, Other Qualifications, and Advancement Persons must complete an associate's degree or certificate program from an accredited community college or technical school to qualify for occupational therapist assistant jobs. In contrast, occupational therapist aides usually receive most of their training on the job. There were 185 accredited occupational therapist assistant programs in the United States in 2000. The first year of study typically involves an introduction to healthcare, basic medical terminology, anatomy, and physiology. In the second year, courses are more rigorous and usually include occupational therapist courses in areas such as mental health, gerontology, and pediatrics. Students also must complete supervised fieldwork in a clinic or community setting. Applicants to occupational therapist assistant programs can improve their chances of admission by taking high school courses in biology and health and by performing volunteer work in nursing homes, occupational or physical therapist's offices, or elsewhere in the healthcare field. Occupational therapist assistants are regulated in most States, and must pass a national certification examination after they graduate. Those who pass the test are awarded the title of certified occupational therapist assistant. Occupational therapist aides usually receive most of their training on the job. Qualified applicants must have a high school diploma, strong interpersonal skills, and a desire to help people in need. Applicants may increase their chances of getting a job by volunteering their services, thus displaying initiative and aptitude to the employer. Assistants and aides must be responsible, patient, and willing to take directions and work as part of a team. Furthermore, they should be caring and want to help people who are not able to help themselves. 28  Job Outlook Employment of occupational therapist assistants and aides is expected to grow much faster than the average for all occupations through 2010. Federal legislation imposing limits on reimbursement for therapy services may adversely affect the job market for occupational therapist assistants and aides in the near term. However, over the long run, demand for occupational therapist assistants and aides will continue to rise, with growth in the number of individuals with disabilities or limited function. Growth will result from an increasing population in older age groups, including the baby-boom generation, which increasingly needs occupational therapy services as they become older. Demand also will result from advances in medicine that allow more people with critical problems to survive and then need rehabilitative therapy. Third-party payers, concerned with rising health care costs may begin to encourage occupational therapists to delegate more of the hands-on therapy work to occupational therapist assistants and aides. By having assistants and aides work more closely with clients under the guidance of a therapist, the cost of therapy should be more modest than otherwise. Earnings Median annual earnings of occupational therapist assistants were $34,340 in 2000. The middle 50 percent earned between $29,280 and $40,690. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $23,970, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $45,370. Median annual earnings of occupational therapist assistants in 2000 were $33,390 in hospitals. Median annual earnings of occupational therapist aides were $20,710 in 2000. The middle 50 percent earned between $16,510 and $28,470. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $14,370, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $35,900. Related Occupations Occupational therapist assistants and aides work under the direction of occupational therapists. Other occupations in the healthcare field that work under the supervision of professionals include dental assistants, medical assistants, pharmacy technicians, and physical therapist assistants and aides.

Increasing use of automated equipment will result in relatively slow job growth. Only a small number of job openings will be created each year because the occupation is small and slowerthan-average growth is expected.  Nature of the Work Ophthalmic laboratory technicians--also known as manufacturing opticians, optical mechanics, or optical goods workers--make prescription eyeglass or contact lenses. Prescription lenses are curved   in such a way that light is correctly focused onto the retina of the patient's eye, improving vision. Some ophthalmic laboratory technicians manufacture lenses for other optical instruments, such as telescopes and binoculars. Ophthalmic laboratory technicians cut, grind, edge, and finish lenses according to specifications provided by dispensing opticians, optometrists, or ophthalmologists, and may insert lenses into frames to produce finished glasses. Although some lenses still are produced by hand, technicians increasingly use automated equipment to make lenses. Ophthalmic laboratory technicians should not be confused with workers in other vision care occupations. Ophthalmologists and optometrists are ""eye doctors"" who examine eyes, diagnose and treat vision problems, and prescribe corrective lenses. Ophthalmologists are physicians who perform eye surgery. Dispensing opticians, who also may do work described here, help patients select frames and lenses, and adjust finished eyeglasses. (See the statement on physicians and surgeons, which includes ophthalmologists, as well as the statements on optometrists and opticians, dispensing, elsewhere in the Handbook.) Ophthalmic laboratory technicians read prescription specifications, then select standard glass or plastic lens blanks and mark them to indicate where the curves specified on the prescription should be ground. They place the lens in the lens grinder, set the dials for the prescribed curvature, and start the machine. After a minute or so, the lens is ready to be ""finished"" by a machine that rotates it against a fine abrasive to grind it and smooth out rough  edges. The lens is then placed in a polishing machine with an even finer abrasive, to polish it to a smooth, bright finish. Next, the technician examines the lens through a lensometer, an instrument similar in shape to a microscope, to make sure the degree and placement of the curve is correct. The technician then cuts the lenses and bevels the edges to fit the frame, dips each lens into dye if the prescription calls for tinted or coated lenses, polishes the edges, and assembles the lenses and frame parts into a finished pair of glasses. In small laboratories, technicians usually handle every phase of the operation. In large ones, technicians may be responsible for operating computerized equipment where virtually every phase of the operation is automated. Technicians also inspect the final product for quality and accuracy. Working Conditions Ophthalmic laboratory technicians work in relatively clean and welllighted laboratories and have limited contact with the public. Surroundings are relatively quiet despite the humming of machines. At times, technicians wear goggles to protect their eyes, and may spend a great deal of time standing. Most ophthalmic laboratory technicians work a 5-day, 40-hour week, which may include weekends, evenings, or occasionally some overtime. Some work part time. Ophthalmic laboratory technicians need to take precautions against the hazards associated with cutting glass, handling chemicals, and working near machinery. Employment Ophthalmic laboratory technicians held about 32,000 jobs in 2000. Thirty-one percent were in retail optical stores that manufacture and sell prescription glasses and contact lenses, and 23 percent were in optical laboratories. These laboratories manufacture eyewear and contact lenses for sale by retail stores, as well as by ophthalmologists and optometrists. Most of the rest were in wholesalers or in optical laboratories that manufacture lenses for other optical instruments, such as telescopes and binoculars. Training, Other Qualifications, and Advancement Nearly all ophthalmic laboratory technicians learn their skills on the job. Employers filling trainee jobs prefer applicants who are high school graduates. Courses in science, mathematics, and computers are valuable; manual dexterity and the ability to do precision work are essential. Technician trainees producing lenses by hand start on simple tasks such as marking or blocking lenses for grinding, then progress to lens grinding, lens cutting, edging, beveling, and eyeglass assembly. Depending on individual aptitude, it may take up to 6 months to become proficient in all phases of the work. Technicians using automated systems will find computer skills valuable. Training is completed on the job and varies in duration depending on the type of machinery and individual aptitude. A very small number of ophthalmic laboratory technicians learn their trade in the Armed Forces or in the few programs in optical technology offered by vocational-technical institutes or trade schools. These programs have classes in optical theory, surfacing and lens finishing, and the reading and applying of prescriptions. Programs vary in length from 6 months to 1 year and award certificates or diplomas. Ophthalmic laboratory technicians can become supervisors and managers. Some technicians become dispensing opticians, although further education or training generally is required. 29  A contact lens manufacturing worker grinds lenses according to prescription.   Job Outlook Overall employment of ophthalmic laboratory technicians is expected to grow more slowly than the average for all occupations through the year 2010. Employment is expected to increase slowly in manufacturing as firms invest in automated machinery. Demographic trends make it likely that many more Americans will need vision care in the years ahead. Not only will the population grow, but also the proportion of middle-aged and older adults is projected to increase rapidly. Middle age is a time when many people use corrective lenses for the first time, and elderly persons usually require more vision care than others. Fashion, too, influences demand. Frames come in a variety of styles and colors--encouraging people to buy more than one pair. Demand also is expected to grow in response to the availability of new technologies that improve the quality and look of corrective lenses, such as antireflective coatings and bifocal lenses without the line visible in traditional bifocals. Most job openings will arise from the need to replace technicians who transfer to other occupations or leave the labor force. However, only a small number of job openings will be created each year because the occupation is small. Earnings Median hourly earnings of ophthalmic laboratory technicians were $9.88 in 2000. The middle 50 percent earned between $8.25 and $12.07 an hour. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $7.19, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $14.71 an hour. In 2000, median hourly earnings of ophthalmic laboratory technicians were $10.25 in ophthalmic goods manufacturing and $9.79 in retail stores, not elsewhere classified, including optical goods stores. Related Occupations Workers in other precision production occupations include dental laboratory technicians, orthotists and prosthetists, and precision instrument and equipment repairers.

See the statement on physicians and surgeons for information about ophthalmologists.) Dispensing opticians examine written prescriptions to determine lens specifications. They recommend eyeglass frames, lenses, and lens coatings after considering the prescription and the customer 's occupation, habits, and facial features. Dispensing opticians measure clients' eyes, including the distance between the centers of the pupils and the distance between the eye surface and the lens. For customers without prescriptions, dispensing opticians may use a lensometer to record the present eyeglass prescription. They also may obtain a customer 's previous record, or verify a prescription with the examining optometrist or ophthalmologist. Dispensing opticians prepare work orders that give ophthalmic laboratory technicians information needed to grind and insert lenses into a frame. The work order includes lens prescriptions and information on lens size, material, color, and style. Some dispensing opticians grind and insert lenses themselves. After the glasses are made, dispensing opticians verify that the lenses have been ground to specifications. Then they may reshape or bend the frame, by hand or using pliers, so that the eyeglasses fit the customer properly and comfortably. Some also fix, adjust, and refit broken frames. They instruct clients about adapting to, wearing, or caring for eyeglasses. Some dispensing opticians specialize in fitting contacts, artificial eyes, or cosmetic shells to cover blemished eyes. To fit contact lenses, dispensing opticians measure eye shape and size, select the type of contact lens material, and prepare work orders specifying the prescription and lens size. Fitting contact lenses requires considerable skill, care, and patience. Dispensing opticians observe customers' eyes, corneas, lids, and contact lenses with special instruments and microscopes. During several visits, opticians show customers how to insert, remove, and care for their contacts, and ensure the fit is correct. Dispensing opticians keep records on customer prescriptions, work orders, and payments; track inventory and sales; and perform other administrative duties. Working Conditions Dispensing opticians work indoors in attractive, well-lighted, and well-ventilated surroundings. They may work in medical offices or small stores where customers are served one at a time, or in large stores where several dispensing opticians serve a number of customers at once. Opticians spend a lot of time on their feet. If they prepare lenses, they need to take precautions against the hazards associated with glass cutting, chemicals, and machinery.  State employment service offices can provide information about job openings for ophthalmic laboratory technicians.  Opticians, Dispensing (O*NET 29-2081.00)  !  ! !  Significant Points Most dispensing opticians receive training on-the-job or through apprenticeships lasting 2 or more years; 22 States require a license. Projected employment growth reflects steadfast demand for corrective lenses and trends in fashion. The number of job openings will be relatively small because the occupation is small.  Nature of Work Dispensing opticians fit eyeglasses and contact lenses, following prescriptions written by ophthalmologists or optometrists. (The work of optometrists is described in a statement elsewhere in the 30  A dispensing optician ensures that eyeglass frames fit properly and comfortably.   Most dispensing opticians work a 40-hour week, although some work longer hours. Those in retail stores may work evenings and weekends. Some work part time. Employment Dispensing opticians held about 68,000 jobs in 2000. Almost half worked for ophthalmologists or optometrists who sell glasses directly to patients. Many also work in retail optical stores that offer onestop shopping. Customers may have their eyes examined, choose frames, and have glasses made on the spot. Some work in optical departments of drug and department stores. Training, Other Qualifications, and Advancement Employers usually hire individuals with no background in opticianry or those who have worked as ophthalmic laboratory technicians and then provide the required training. (See the statement on ophthalmic laboratory technicians elsewhere in the Handbook.) Most dispensing opticians receive training on-the-job or through apprenticeships lasting 2 or more years. Some employers, however, seek people with postsecondary training in opticianry. Knowledge of physics, basic anatomy, algebra, geometry, and mechanical drawing is particularly valuable because training usually includes instruction in optical mathematics, optical physics, and the use of precision measuring instruments and other machinery and tools. Dispensing opticians deal directly with the public, so they should be tactful, pleasant, and communicate well. Manual dexterity and the ability to do precision work are essential. Large employers usually offer structured apprenticeship programs, and small employers provide more informal on-the-job training. In the 22 States that require dispensing opticians to be licensed, individuals without postsecondary training work from 2 to 4 years as apprentices. Apprenticeship or formal training is offered in most States as well. Apprentices receive technical training and learn office management and sales. Under the supervision of an experienced optician, optometrist, or ophthalmologist, apprentices work directly with patients, fitting eyeglasses and contact lenses. In the 21 States requiring licensure, information about apprenticeships and licensing procedures is available from the State board of occupational licensing. Formal opticianry training is offered in community colleges and a few colleges and universities. In 2000, the Commission on Opticianry Accreditation accredited 25 programs that awarded 2-year associate degrees in opticianry. There also are shorter programs of 1 year or less. Some States that offer a license to dispensing opticians allow graduates to take the licensure exam immediately upon graduation; others require a few months to a year of experience. Dispensing opticians may apply to the American Board of Opticianry (ABO) and the National Contact Lens Examiners (NCLE) for certification of their skills. Certification must be renewed every 3 years through continuing education. Those licensed in States where licensing renewal requirements include continuing education credits may use proof of their renewed State license to meet the recertification requirements of the ABO. Likewise, the NCLE will accept proof of license renewal from any State that has contact lens requirements. Many experienced dispensing opticians open their own optical stores. Others become managers of optical stores or sales representatives for wholesalers or manufacturers of eyeglasses or lenses. Job Outlook Employment of dispensing opticians is expected to increase about as fast as the average for all occupations through 2010 as demand  grows for corrective lenses. The number of middle-aged and elderly persons is projected to increase rapidly. Middle age is a time when many individuals use corrective lenses for the first time, and elderly persons generally require more vision care than others. Fashion, too, influences demand. Frames come in a growing variety of styles and colors--encouraging people to buy more than one pair. Demand also is expected to grow in response to the availability of new technologies that improve the quality and look of corrective lenses, such as anti-reflective coatings and bifocal lenses without the line visible in old-style bifocals. Improvements in bifocal, extended wear, and disposable contact lenses also will spur demand. The need to replace those who leave the occupation will result in additional job openings. Nevertheless, the total number of job openings will be relatively small because the occupation is small. This occupation is vulnerable to changes in the business cycle because eyewear purchases often can be deferred for a time. Employment of opticians can fall somewhat during economic downturns.  Earnings Median annual earnings of dispensing opticians were $24,430 in 2000. The middle 50 percent earned between $19,200 and $31,770. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $15,900, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $39,660. Median annual earnings in the industries employing the largest numbers of dispensing opticians in 2000 were as follows: Offices and clinics of medical doctors ........................................ $28,220 Retail stores, not elsewhere classified ........................................ 25,120 Offices of other health practitioners ........................................... 22,670 Department stores ....................................................................... 21,410  Related Occupations Other workers who deal with customers and perform delicate work include camera and photographic equipment repairers, dental laboratory technicians, jewelers and precious stone and metal workers, locksmiths and safe repairers, ophthalmic laboratory technicians, orthotists and prosthetists, and watch repairers.

There are many opportunities for part-time work in both retail and hospital settings. Employment Pharmacy aides held about 57,000 jobs in 2000. Over 80 percent were in retail pharmacies, either independently owned or part of a drug store chain, grocery store, department store, or mass retailer. The vast majority of these are in drug stores. Thirteen percent were in hospitals, and the rest were in mail-order pharmacies, clinics, pharmaceutical wholesalers, and the Federal Government. Training, Other Qualifications, and Advancement Most pharmacy aides receive informal on-the-job training, but employers favor those with at least a high school diploma. Prospective pharmacy aides with experience working as a cashier may have an advantage. Employers also prefer applicants with strong customer service and communication skills and experience managing inventories and using a computer. Aides entering the field need strong spelling, reading, and mathematics skills. Successful pharmacy aides are organized, dedicated, friendly, and responsible. They should be willing and able to take directions. Candidates interested in becoming pharmacy aides cannot have prior records of drug or substance abuse. Strong interpersonal and communication skills are needed because there is a lot of interaction with patients, coworkers, and healthcare professionals. Teamwork is very important because aides are often required to work with technicians and pharmacists. Pharmacy aides almost always are trained on the job. They may begin by observing a more experienced worker. After they become familiar with the store's equipment, policies, and procedures, they begin to work on their own. Once they become experienced workers, they are not likely to receive additional training, except when new equipment is introduced or when policies or procedures change. To become a pharmacy aide, one should be able to perform repetitious work accurately. Aides need good basic mathematics skills and good manual dexterity. Because they deal constantly with the public, pharmacy aides should be neat in appearance and able to deal pleasantly and tactfully with customers. Some employers may prefer people with experience typing, handling money, or operating specialized equipment, including computers. Advancement usually is limited, although some aides may decide to become a pharmacy technician or to enroll in pharmacy school to become a pharmacist. Job Outlook Job opportunities for full- and part-time work are expected to be good, especially for aides with related work experience. Job openings will be created by employment growth and by the need to replace workers who transfer to other occupations or leave the labor force. Employment of pharmacy aides is expected to grow about as fast as the average for all occupations through 2010 due to the increased pharmaceutical needs of a larger and older population and to the greater use of medication. The increased number of middleaged and elderly people--who, on average, use more prescription drugs than do younger people--will spur demand for aides in all practice settings. Cost-conscious insurers, pharmacies, and health systems will continue to emphasize the role of aides. As a result, pharmacy aides will assume responsibility for more routine tasks previously performed by pharmacists and pharmacy technicians, thereby giving pharmacists more time to interact with patients and affording technicians more time to prepare medications.  ! ! !  Significant Points Many pharmacy aides work evenings, weekends, and some holidays. Eight out of 10 jobs are in retail pharmacies. Job opportunities are expected to be good, especially for those with related work experience.  Nature of the Work Pharmacy aides help licensed pharmacists with administrative duties in running a pharmacy. Aides often are clerks or cashiers who primarily answer telephones, handle money, stock shelves, and perform other clerical duties. They work closely with pharmacy technicians. Pharmacy technicians usually perform more complex tasks than do assistants, although, in some States, their duties and job titles overlap. (See the statement on pharmacy technicians elsewhere in the Handbook.) Aides refer any questions regarding prescriptions, drug information, or health matters to a pharmacist. (See the statement on pharmacists elsewhere in the Handbook.) Aides have several important duties that help the pharmacy to function smoothly. They may establish and maintain patient profiles, prepare insurance claim forms, and stock and take inventory of prescription and over-the-counter medications. Accurate recordkeeping is necessary to help avert a potentially dangerous drug interaction. Because many people have medical insurance to help pay for the prescription, it is essential that pharmacy aides efficiently and correctly correspond with the third-party insurance providers to obtain payment. They also maintain the inventory and inform the supervisor of stock needs so that the pharmacy has the vital medications for those who need them. Some also clean pharmacy equipment, help with the maintenance of equipment and supplies, and manage the cash register. Working Conditions Pharmacy aides work in clean, organized, well-lighted, and wellventilated areas. Most of their workday is spent on their feet. They may be required to lift heavy boxes or to use stepladders to retrieve supplies from high shelves. Aides work the same hours as pharmacists. This includes evenings, nights, weekends, and some holidays. Because some  Helping to keep complete and accurate medication records is an important duty of pharmacy aides. 32   Earnings Median hourly earnings of pharmacy aides were $8.52 in 2000. The middle 50 percent earned between $7.16 and $10.58; the lowest 10 percent earned less than $6.12, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $13.14. Median hourly earnings of pharmacy aides were $8.02 in drug stores and proprietary stores, $11.17 in hospitals, and $8.47 in grocery stores in 2000. Related Occupations The work of pharmacy aides is closely related to that of pharmacy technicians. Workers in other medical support occupations include dental assistants, licensed practical and licensed vocational nurses, medical transcriptionists, medical records and health information technicians, occupational therapist assistants and aides, physical therapist assistants and aides, and surgical technologists. Sources of Additional Information For information on employment opportunities, contact local employers or local offices of the State employment service. Pharmacy technicians help to ensure that patients get necessary medication. In hospitals, technicians have added responsibilities. They read patient charts and prepare and deliver the medicine to patients. The pharmacist must check the order before it is delivered to the patient. The technician then copies the information about the prescribed medication onto the patient's profile. Technicians also may assemble a 24-hour supply of medicine for every patient. They package and label each dose separately. The package is then placed in the medicine cabinet of each patient until the supervising pharmacist checks it for accuracy. It is then given to the patient. Working Conditions Pharmacy technicians work in clean, organized, well-lighted, and well-ventilated areas. Most of their workday is spent on their feet. They may be required to lift heavy boxes or to use stepladders to retrieve supplies from high shelves. Technicians work the same hours as pharmacists. This may include evenings, nights, weekends, and holidays. Because some hospital and retail pharmacies are open 24 hours a day, technicians may work varying shifts. As their seniority increases, technicians often have increased control over the hours they work. There are many opportunities for part-time work in both retail and hospital settings. Employment Pharmacy technicians held about 190,000 jobs in 2000. Two-thirds of all jobs were in retail pharmacies, either independently owned or part of a drug store chain, grocery store, department store, or mass retailer. More than 2 out of 10 jobs were in hospitals and a small number were in mail-order and Internet pharmacies, clinics, pharmaceutical wholesalers, and the Federal Government. Training, Other Qualifications, and Advancement Although most pharmacy technicians receive informal on-the-job training, employers favor those who have completed formal training and certification. However, there are currently few State and no Federal requirements for formal training or certification of pharmacy technicians. Employers who can neither afford, nor have the time to give, on-the-job training often seek formally educated pharmacy technicians. Formal education programs and certification emphasize the technicians' interest in and dedication to the work to potential employers. In addition to the military, some hospitals, proprietary schools, vocational or technical colleges, and community colleges offer formal education programs. Formal pharmacy-technician education programs require classroom and laboratory work in a variety of areas, including medical 33  Pharmacy Technicians (O*NET 29-2052.00)  !  ! !

They must verify that the information on the prescription is complete and accurate. To prepare the prescription, technicians must retrieve, count, pour, weigh, measure, and sometimes mix the medication. Then, they prepare the prescription labels, select the type of prescription container, and affix the prescription and auxiliary labels to the container. Once the prescription is filled, technicians price and file the prescription, which must be checked by a pharmacist before it is given to a patient. Technicians may establish and maintain patient profiles, prepare insurance claim forms, and stock and take inventory of prescription and over-the-counter medications.   and pharmaceutical terminology, pharmaceutical calculations, pharmacy recordkeeping, pharmaceutical techniques, and pharmacy law and ethics. Technicians also are required to learn medication names, actions, uses, and doses. Many training programs include internships, in which students gain hands-on experience in actual pharmacies. Students receive a diploma, certificate, or an associate degree, depending on the program. Prospective pharmacy technicians with experience working as an aide in a community pharmacy or volunteering in a hospital may have an advantage. Employers also prefer applicants with strong customer service and communication skills and with experience managing inventories, counting, measuring, and using computers. Technicians entering the field need strong mathematics, spelling, and reading skills. A background in chemistry, English, and health education also may be beneficial. Some technicians are hired without formal training, but under the condition that they obtain certification within a specified period to retain employment. The Pharmacy Technician Certification Board administers the National Pharmacy Technician Certification Examination. This exam is voluntary and displays the competency of the individual to act as a pharmacy technician. Eligible candidates must have a high school diploma or GED, and those who pass the exam earn the title of Certified Pharmacy Technician (CPhT). The exam is offered several times per year at various locations nationally. Employers, often pharmacists, know that individuals who pass the exam have a standardized body of knowledge and skills. Certified technicians must be recertified every 2 years. Technicians must complete 20 contact hours of pharmacy-related topics within the 2-year certification period to become eligible for recertification. Contact hours are awarded for on-the-job training, attending lectures, and college coursework. At least 1 contact hour must be in pharmacy law. Contact hours can be earned from several different sources, including pharmacy associations, pharmacy colleges, and pharmacy technician training programs. Up to 10 contact hours can be earned when the technician is employed under the direct supervision and instruction of a pharmacist. Successful pharmacy technicians are alert, observant, organized, dedicated, and responsible. They should be willing and able to take directions. They must enjoy precise work--details are sometimes a matter of life and death. Although a pharmacist must check and approve all their work, they should be able to work on their own without constant instruction from the pharmacist. Candidates interested in becoming pharmacy technicians cannot have prior records of drug or substance abuse. Strong interpersonal and communication skills are needed because there is a lot of interaction with patients, coworkers, and healthcare professionals. Teamwork is very important because technicians are often required to work with pharmacists, aides, and other technicians. Job Outlook Good job opportunities are expected for full-time and part-time work, especially for technicians with formal training or previous experience. Job openings for pharmacy technicians will result from the expansion of retail pharmacies and other employment settings, and from the need to replace workers who transfer to other occupations or leave the labor force. Employment of pharmacy technicians is expected to grow much faster than the average for all occupations through 2010 due to the increased pharmaceutical needs of a larger and older population, and to the greater use of medication. The increased number of middle-aged and elderly people--who, on average, use more prescription drugs than do younger people--will spur demand for technicians in all practice settings. With advances in science, more medications are becoming available to treat more conditions. 34  Cost-conscious insurers, pharmacies, and health systems will continue to emphasize the role of technicians. As a result, pharmacy technicians will assume responsibility for more routine tasks previously performed by pharmacists. Pharmacy technicians also will need to learn and master new pharmacy technology as it surfaces. For example, robotic machines are used to dispense medicine into containers; technicians must oversee the machines, stock the bins, and label the containers. Thus, while automation is increasingly incorporated into the job, it will not necessarily reduce the need for technicians. Almost all States have legislated the maximum number of technicians who can safely work under a pharmacist at a time. In some States, increased demand for technicians has encouraged an expanded ratio of technicians to pharmacists. Changes in these laws could directly affect employment. Earnings Median hourly earnings of pharmacy technicians in 2000 were $9.93. The middle 50 percent earned between $8.12 and $12.26; the lowest 10 percent earned less than $7.00, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $14.56. Median hourly earnings in the industries employing the largest numbers of pharmacy technicians in 2000 were as follows: Hospitals ..................................................................................... Grocery stores ............................................................................. Drugs, proprietaries, and sundries .............................................. Drug stores and proprietary stores .............................................. Department stores ....................................................................... $11.44 10.57 10.09 9.00 8.75  Certified technicians may earn more. Shift differentials for working evenings or weekends also can increase earnings. Some technicians belong to unions representing hospital or grocery store workers. Related Occupations This occupation is most closely related to pharmacists and pharmacy aides. Workers in other medical support occupations include dental assistants, licensed practical and licensed vocational nurses, medical transcriptionists, medical records and health information technicians, occupational therapist assistants and aides, physical therapist assistants and aides, secretaries and administrative assistants, and surgical technologists.

Internet: http://www.ptcb.org  Physical Therapist Assistants and Aides (O*NET 31-2021.00, 31-2022.00)  !  !  !  Significant Points Employment is projected to increase much faster than the average, as rapid growth in the number of middleaged and elderly individuals increases the demand for therapeutic services. Licensed physical therapist assistants have an associate's degree, but physical therapist aides usually learn skills on the job. More than two-thirds of jobs for physical therapist assistants and aides were in hospitals or offices of physical therapists.   Nature of the Work Physical therapist assistants and aides perform components of physical therapy procedures and related tasks selected by a supervising physical therapist. These workers assist physical therapists in providing services that help improve mobility, relieve pain, and prevent or limit permanent physical disabilities of patients suffering from injuries or disease. Patients include accident victims and individuals with disabling conditions, such as low back pain, arthritis, heart disease, fractures, head injuries, and cerebral palsy. Physical therapist assistants perform a variety of tasks. Components of treatment procedures performed by these workers, under the direction and supervision of physical therapists, involve exercises, massages, electrical stimulation, paraffin baths, hot and cold packs, traction, and ultrasound. Physical therapist assistants record the patient's responses to treatment and report to the physical therapist the outcome of each treatment. Physical therapist aides help make therapy sessions productive, under the direct supervision of a physical therapist or physical therapist assistant. They usually are responsible for keeping the treatment area clean and organized and preparing for each patient's therapy. When patients need assistance moving to or from a treatment area, aides push them in a wheelchair, or provide them with a shoulder to lean on. Because they are not licensed, aides do not perform the clinical tasks of a physical therapist assistant. The duties of aides include some clerical tasks, such as ordering depleted supplies, answering the phone, and filling out insurance forms and other paperwork. The extent to which an aide or an assistant performs clerical tasks depends on the size and location of the facility. Working Conditions The hours and days that physical therapist assistants and aides work vary, depending on the facility and on whether they are full or parttime employees. Many outpatient physical therapy offices and clinics have evening and weekend hours, to help coincide with patients' personal schedules.  Physical therapist assistants and aides need to have a moderate degree of strength, due to the physical exertion required in assisting patients with their treatment. For example, in some cases, assistants and aides need to help lift patients. Additionally, constant kneeling, stooping, and standing for long periods are all part of the job. Employment Physical therapist assistants and aides held 80,000 jobs in 2000. Physical therapist assistants held about 44,000 jobs; and physical therapist aides held about 36,000. They work alongside physical therapists in a variety of settings. More than two-thirds of jobs for assistants and aides were in hospitals or offices of physical therapists. Others work in nursing and personal care facilities, outpatient rehabilitation centers, offices and clinics of physicians, and home health agencies. Training, Other Qualifications, and Advancement Physical therapist aides are trained on the job, but physical therapist assistants typically earn an associate's degree from an accredited physical therapist assistant program. Licensure or registration is not required in all States for the physical therapist assistant to practice. The States that require licensure stipulate specific educational and examination criteria. Complete information on practice acts and regulations can be obtained from the State licensing boards. Additional requirements may include certification in CPR and other first aid and a minimum number of hours of clinical experience. According to the American Physical Therapy Association, there were 268 accredited physical therapist assistant programs in the United States as of 2001. Accredited physical therapist assistant programs are designed to last 2 years, or 4 semesters, and culminate in an associate's degree. Programs are divided into academic study and hands on clinical experience. Academic coursework includes algebra, anatomy and physiology, biology, chemistry, and psychology. Before students begin their clinical field experience, many programs require that they complete a semester of anatomy and physiology and have certifications in CPR and other first aid. Both educators and prospective employers view clinical experience as an integral part of ensuring that students understand the responsibilities of a physical therapist assistant. Employers typically require physical therapist aides to have a high school diploma, strong interpersonal skills, and a desire to assist people in need. Most employers provide clinical on-the-job training. Job Outlook Employment of physical therapist assistants and aides is expected to grow much faster than the average through the year 2010. Federal legislation imposing limits on reimbursement for therapy services may adversely affect the job market for physical therapist assistants and aides in the near term. However, over the long run, demand for physical therapist assistants and aides will continue to rise, with growth in the number of individuals with disabilities or limited function. The rapidly growing elderly population is particularly vulnerable to chronic and debilitating conditions that require therapeutic services. These patients often need additional assistance in their treatment, making the roles of assistants and aides vital. The large baby-boom generation is entering the prime age for heart attacks and strokes, further increasing the demand for cardiac and physical rehabilitation. Additionally, future medical developments should permit an increased percentage of trauma victims to survive, creating added demand for therapy services. Licensed physical therapist assistants can enhance the costeffective provision of physical therapy services. Once a patient is 35  Physical therapist assistants help patients with stretching exercises during treatment.   evaluated, and a treatment plan is designed by the physical therapist, the physical therapist assistant can provide many aspects of treatment, as prescribed by the therapist. Earnings Median annual earnings of physical therapist assistants were $33,870 in 2000. The middle 50 percent earned between $28,830 and $40,440. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $23,150, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $45,610. Median annual earnings of physical therapist assistants in 2000 were $33,660 in offices of other healthcare practitioners and $33,820 in hospitals. Median annual earnings of physical therapist aides were $19,670 in 2000. The middle 50 percent earned between $16,460 and $23,390. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $14,590, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $28,800. Median annual earnings of physical therapist aides in 2000 were $18,320 in offices of other healthcare practitioners and $19,840 in hospitals. Related Occupations Physical therapist assistants and aides work under the supervision of physical therapists. Other occupations in the healthcare field that work under the supervision of professionals include dental assistants, medical assistants, occupational therapist assistants and aides, and pharmacy technicians.

Radiologic Technologists and Technicians (O*NET 29-2034.01, 29-2034.02)  !  !  !  Significant Points Faster-than-average growth will arise from an increase in the number of middle-aged and older persons who are the primary users of diagnostic procedures Although hospitals will remain the primary employer of radiologic technologists and technicians, a greater number of new jobs will be found in offices and clinics of physicians, including diagnostic imaging centers. Radiologic technologists and technicians with cross training in nuclear medicine technology or other modalities will have the best prospects.  Nature of the Work Radiologic technologists and technicians take x rays and administer nonradioactive materials into patients' blood streams for diagnostic purposes. Some specialize in diagnostic imaging technologies such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In addition to radiologic technologists and technicians, others who assist in diagnostic imaging procedures include cardiovascular technologists and technicians, diagnostic medical sonographers, and nuclear medicine technologists. (Each is discussed elsewhere in the Handbook.) 36  Radiologic technologists and technicians, also referred to as radiographers, produce x-ray films (radiographs) of parts of the human body for use in diagnosing medical problems. They prepare patients for radiologic examinations by explaining the procedure, removing articles such as jewelry, through which x rays cannot pass, and positioning patients so that the parts of the body can be appropriately radiographed. To prevent unnecessary radiation exposure, they surround the exposed area with radiation protection devices, such as lead shields, or limit the size of the x-ray beam. Radiographers position radiographic equipment at the correct angle and height over the appropriate area of a patient's body. Using instruments similar to a measuring tape, they may measure the thickness of the section to be radiographed and set controls on the x-ray machine to produce radiographs of the appropriate density, detail, and contrast. They place the x-ray film under the part of the patient's body to be examined and make the exposure. They then remove the film and develop it. Experienced radiographers may perform more complex imaging procedures. For fluoroscopies, radiographers prepare a solution of contrast medium for the patient to drink, allowing the radiologist, a physician who interprets radiographs, to see soft tissues in the body. Some radiographers, called CT technologists, operate computerized tomography scanners to produce cross sectional images of patients. Others operate machines using strong magnets and radio waves rather than radiation to create an image and are called magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technologists. Radiologic technologists and technicians must follow physicians' orders precisely and conform to regulations concerning use of radiation to protect themselves, their patients, and coworkers from unnecessary exposure. In addition to preparing patients and operating equipment, radiologic technologists and technicians keep patient records and adjust and maintain equipment. They also may prepare work schedules, evaluate equipment purchases, or manage a radiology department. Working Conditions Most full-time radiologic technologists and technicians work about 40 hours a week; they may have evening, weekend, or on-call hours. Opportunities for part-time and shift work are also available. Because technologists and technicians are on their feet for long periods and may lift or turn disabled patients, physical stamina is important. Technologists and technicians work at diagnostic machines but may also do some procedures at patients' bedsides. Some   travel to patients in large vans equipped with sophisticated diagnostic equipment. Although potential radiation hazards exist in this occupation, they are minimized by the use of lead aprons, gloves, and other shielding devices, as well as by instruments monitoring radiation exposure. Technologists and technicians wear badges measuring radiation levels in the radiation area, and detailed records are kept on their cumulative lifetime dose. Employment Radiologic technologists and technicians held about 167,000 jobs in 2000. About 1 in 5 worked part time. More than half of all jobs are in hospitals. Most of the rest are in physicians' offices and clinics, including diagnostic imaging centers. Training, Other Qualifications, and Advancement Preparation for this profession is offered in hospitals, colleges and universities, vocational-technical institutes, and the U.S. Armed Forces. Hospitals, which employ most radiologic technologists and technicians, prefer to hire those with formal training. Formal training programs in radiography range in length from 1 to 4 years and lead to a certificate, associate's degree, or bachelor 's degree. Two-year associate's degree programs are most prevalent. Some 1-year certificate programs are available for experienced radiographers or individuals from other health occupations, such as medical technologists and registered nurses, who want to change fields or specialize in computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. A bachelor 's or master 's degree in one of the radiologic technologies is desirable for supervisory, administrative, or teaching positions. The Joint Review Committee on Education in Radiologic Technology accredits most formal training programs for this field. They accredited 584 radiography programs in 2000. Radiography programs require, at a minimum, a high school diploma or the equivalent. High school courses in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology are helpful. The programs provide both classroom and clinical instruction in anatomy and physiology, patient care procedures, radiation physics, radiation protection, principles of imaging, medical terminology, positioning of patients, medical ethics, radiobiology, and pathology. In 1981, Congress passed the Consumer-Patient Radiation Health and Safety Act, which aims to protect the public from the hazards of unnecessary exposure to medical and dental radiation by ensuring operators of radiologic equipment are properly trained. Under the act, the Federal Government sets voluntary standards that the States, in turn, may use for accrediting training programs and certifying individuals who engage in medical or dental radiography. In 1999, 35 States and Puerto Rico licensed radiologic technologists and technicians. Voluntary registration is offered by the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists (ARRT) in radiography. To be eligible for registration, technologists generally must graduate from an accredited program and pass an examination. Many employers prefer to hire registered radiographers. To be recertified, radiographers must complete 24 hours of continuing education every other year. Radiologic technologists and technicians should be sensitive to patients' physical and psychological needs. They must pay attention to detail, follow instructions, and work as part of a team. In addition, operating complicated equipment requires mechanical ability and manual dexterity. With experience and additional training, staff technologists may become specialists, performing CT scanning, angiography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Experienced technologists may also  be promoted to supervisor, chief radiologic technologist, and-- ultimately--department administrator or director. Depending on the institution, courses or a master 's degree in business or health administration may be necessary for the director 's position. Some technologists progress by becoming instructors or directors in radiologic technology programs; others take jobs as sales representatives or instructors with equipment manufacturers. Job Outlook Employment of radiologic technologists and technicians is expected to grow faster than the average for all occupations through 2010, as the population grows and ages, increasing the demand for diagnostic imaging. Opportunities are expected to be favorable. Some employers report shortages of radiologic technologists and technicians. Imbalances between the supply of qualified workers and demand should spur efforts to attract and retain qualified radiologic technologists and technicians. For example, employers may provide more flexible training programs, or improve compensation and working conditions. Although physicians are enthusiastic about the clinical benefits of new technologies, the extent to which they are adopted depends largely on cost and reimbursement considerations. For example, digital imaging technology can improve quality and efficiency, but remains expensive. Some promising new technologies may not come into widespread use because they are too expensive and third-party payers may not be willing to pay for their use. Radiologic technologists who are educated and credentialed in more than one type of diagnostic imaging technology, such as radiography and sonography or nuclear medicine, will have better employment opportunities as employers look for new ways to control costs. In hospitals, multi-skilled employees will be the most sought after, as hospitals respond to cost pressures by continuing to merge departments. Hospitals will remain the principal employer of radiologic technologists and technicians. However, a greater number of new jobs will be found in offices and clinics of physicians, including diagnostic imaging centers. Health facilities such as these are expected to grow very rapidly through 2010 due to the strong shift toward outpatient care, encouraged by third-party payers and made possible by technological advances that permit more procedures to be performed outside the hospital. Some job openings will also arise from the need to replace technologists and technicians who leave the occupation. Earnings Median annual earnings of radiologic technologists and technicians were $36,000 in 2000. The middle 50 percent earned between $30,220 and $43,380. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $25,310, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $52,050. Median annual earnings in the industries employing the largest numbers of radiologic technologists and technicians in 2000 were: Medical and dental laboratories .................................................. $39,400 Hospitals ..................................................................................... 36,280 Offices and clinics of medical doctors ........................................ 34,870  Related Occupations Radiologic technologists and technicians operate sophisticated equipment to help physicians, dentists, and other health practitioners diagnose and treat patients. Workers in related occupations include cardiovascular technologists and technicians, clinical laboratory technologists and technicians, diagnostic medical sonographers, nuclear medicine technologists, radiation therapists, and respiratory therapists. 37   Sources of Additional Information For career information, send a stamped, self-addressed business size envelope with your request to: !

Wacker Dr., Suite 600, Chicago, IL 60606-2901. Internet: http://www.jrcert.org  During surgery, technologists pass instruments and other sterile supplies to surgeons and surgeon assistants. They may hold retractors, cut sutures, and help count sponges, needles, supplies, and instruments. Surgical technologists help prepare, care for, and dispose of specimens taken for laboratory analysis and help apply dressings. Some operate sterilizers, lights, or suction machines, and help operate diagnostic equipment. After an operation, surgical technologists may help transfer patients to the recovery room and clean and restock the operating room. Working Conditions Surgical technologists work in clean, well-lighted, cool environments. They must stand for long periods and remain alert during operations. At times they may be exposed to communicable diseases and unpleasant sights, odors, and materials. Most surgical technologists work a regular 40-hour week, although they may be on call or work nights, weekends and holidays on a rotating basis. Employment Surgical technologists held about 71,000 jobs in 2000. Almost threequarters are employed by hospitals, mainly in operating and delivery rooms. Others are employed in clinics and surgical centers, and in the offices of physicians and dentists who perform outpatient surgery. A few, known as private scrubs, are employed directly by surgeons who have special surgical teams, like those for liver transplants. Training, Other Qualifications, and Advancement Surgical technologists receive their training in formal programs offered by community and junior colleges, vocational schools, universities, hospitals, and the military. In 2001, the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs (CAAHEP) recognized 350 accredited programs. High school graduation normally is required for admission. Programs last 9 to 24 months and lead to a certificate, diploma, or associate degree. Programs provide classroom education and supervised clinical experience. Students take courses in anatomy, physiology, microbiology, pharmacology, professional ethics, and medical terminology. Other studies cover the care and safety of patients during surgery, aseptic techniques, and surgical procedures. Students also learn to sterilize instruments; prevent and control infection; and handle special drugs, solutions, supplies, and equipment. Technologists may obtain voluntary professional certification from the Liaison Council on Certification for the Surgical Technologist by graduating from a CAAHEP-accredited program and passing a national certification examination. They may then use the designation Certified Surgical Technologist, or CST. Continuing education or reexamination is required to maintain certification, which must be renewed every 6 years. Certification may also be obtained from the National Center for Competency Testing. To qualify to take the exam, candidates follow one of three paths: complete an accredited training program, undergo a 2-year hospital onthe-job training program, or acquire seven years experience working in the field. After passing the exam, individuals may use the designation National Certified Technician O.R. This certification may be renewed every 5 years through either continuing education or reexamination. Most employers prefer to hire certified technologists. Surgical technologists need manual dexterity to handle instruments quickly. They also must be conscientious, orderly, and emotionally stable to handle the demands of the operating room environment. Technologists must respond quickly and know procedures well to have instruments ready for surgeons without having to be told. They are expected to keep abreast of new developments in the field. Recommended high school courses include health, biology, chemistry, and mathematics.  For information on certification, contact: !

Significant Points Most educational programs for surgical technologists last approximately 1 year and result in a certificate. Employment of surgical technologists is expected to grow faster than average as the number of surgical procedures grows.  Nature of the Work Surgical technologists, also called scrubs and surgical or operating room technicians, assist in surgical operations under the supervision of surgeons, registered nurses, or other surgical personnel. Surgical technologists are members of operating room teams, which most commonly include surgeons, anesthesiologists, and circulating nurses. Before an operation, surgical technologists help prepare the operating room by setting up surgical instruments and equipment, sterile drapes, and sterile solutions. They assemble both sterile and nonsterile equipment, as well as adjust and check it to ensure it is working properly. Technologists also get patients ready for surgery by washing, shaving, and disinfecting incision sites. They transport patients to the operating room, help position them on the operating table, and cover them with sterile surgical ""drapes."" Technologists also observe patients' vital signs, check charts, and assist the surgical team with putting on sterile gowns and gloves.  Surgical technologists prepare operating rooms and assist surgical personnel during operations. 38   Technologists advance by specializing in a particular area of surgery, such as neurosurgery or open heart surgery. They also may work as circulating technologists. A circulating technologist is the ""unsterile"" member of the surgical team who prepares patients; helps with anesthesia; obtains and opens packages for the ""sterile"" persons to remove the sterile contents during the procedure; interviews the patient before surgery; keeps a written account of the surgical procedure; and answers the surgeon's questions about the patient during the surgery. With additional training, some technologists advance to first assistants, who help with retracting, sponging, suturing, cauterizing bleeders, and closing and treating wounds. Some surgical technologists manage central supply departments in hospitals, or take positions with insurance companies, sterile supply services, and operating equipment firms. Job Outlook Employment of surgical technologists is expected to grow faster than the average for all occupations through the year 2010 as the volume of surgery increases. The number of surgical procedures is expected to rise as the population grows and ages. As the ""baby boom"" generation enters retirement age, the over 50 population will account for a larger portion of the general population. Older people require more surgical procedures. Technological advances, such as fiber optics and laser technology, will also permit new surgical procedures to be performed. Hospitals will continue to be the primary employer of surgical technologists, although much faster employment growth is expected in offices and clinics of physicians, including ambulatory surgical centers.  Earnings Median annual earnings of surgical technologists were $29,020 in 2000. The middle 50 percent earned between $24,490 and $34,160. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $20,490, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $40,310. Median annual earnings of surgical technologists in 2000 were $31,190 in offices and clinics of medical doctors and $28,340 in hospitals. Related Occupations Other health occupations requiring approximately 1 year of training after high school include dental assistants, licensed practical and licensed vocational nurses, medical and clinical laboratory technicians, medical assistants, and respiratory therapy technicians.

The health and safety of patrons will be a pharmacist's first consideration and the nature of their problems or ailments or any confidence entrusted to him in his professional capacity will not be divulged except in response to legal requirements or in the best interest of the patron. (7) Practice of medicine. A pharmacist will refrain from any attempt at diagnosis or treatment that might infringe upon the legally constituted right or obligation of any practitioner of the healing arts.

A pharmacist will oppose any secret arrangement between pharmacist and physician or any practitioner of the healing arts whereby fees are divided or in which private formulas are concerned since such arrangements are known to be inimical to public health.

L. A. Lloyd, RPh, Editor ing advances in medicine and health care. As a result, pharmacists need to carefully choose and attentively pursue quality continuing education (CE) to maintain the all-important ability to provide the best possible pharmaceutical care one patient at a time. In Arizona, we are blessed with exceptional CE offerings available from such in-state providers as the Arizona Pharmacy Association, the Arizona Society of Hospital Pharmacists, the University of Arizona College of Pharmacy, and Midwestern University-Glendale College of Pharmacy. We all know how important being current in our profession is, and most of us also know the value of quality CE. How about a New Year 's resolution to thoughtfully consider an area that you personally want to improve upon and seek out the CE that will assist you the most. One clarification: For those who believe that ""pharmacy law"" CE is required to be only Arizona pharmacy law, here is some good news. The Board accepts any ACPE CE program having an approved program number ending in ""03.""  2003 Board Meeting Information         (Unless otherwise stated, meetings begin at 9 AM) January 15-16 at the Glendale Library, 59th Ave and Brown March 12-13 at the Board of Pharmacy office April 23-24 at the Board of Pharmacy office June 19 at the Sheraton El Conquistador Resort-Tucson (a oneday meeting) August 27-28 at the Prescott (location to be announced) November 5-6 at the Board of Pharmacy office All Board Meetings are open to the public.

The Board of Pharmacy and the DPS will be focusing on compliance with this state statute. To view the actual statute addressing vendor responsibilities and definitions of terminology relating to precursor chemical sales, visit the Web site at www.az.leg.state.az.us/ars/13/03404.01.htm, or contact your Board of Pharmacy compliance officer. It is important that retailers follow the statute when selling precursor chemicals.  Congratulations Congratulations to Jean Lee of Peoria and Michael J. Zoucha of Glendale. Both have recently been accredited as Certified Geriatric Pharmacists (CGP).  Odds and Ends We have all heard it said: ""The more things change, the more they stay the same."" Change is everywhere in our society and the pharmacy profession is not exempt. Consider how recently computers came to the pharmacy. Faxed prescriptions, drive-thru service, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, electronic claims processing, electronic prescribing, Internet prescribing, and FedEx prescriptions are a few other recent changes. What has not changed is the need for every pharmacist to interact with his or her patient(s) to achieve optimum outcomes from his or her medications. Another item that has not changed, at least in recent memory, is the trend of having a pharmacist shortage. Together, these truisms point to the importance of keeping current with the astonish-  A Practice Improvement Reminder During a recent Board of Pharmacy meeting, several pharmacist conferences resulting from patient complaints were held. The complaints included the usual ""inconsiderate treatment by pharmacy staff"" to the more concerning complaint of a directions for use error for a pediatric patient. Even more disturbing, there were three dispensing-related errors involving pediatric patients. In listening to the pharmacists' recollections of these errors and those from previous meetings, a retrospective review reveals a commonality involving two pharmacists. First (which is really two items in one), either they (the RPhs) remember being very busy and underContinued on page 4  AZ Vol. 24, No. 1  Page 1   Continued from page 1  staffed at the time or the verifying pharmacist failed to recognize the error; and, second, when a labeling error (wrong directions) was cited in the complaint. The Board is frequently told, ""The computer did not warn of the error."" The question that then comes to mind is, whose name is on the license hanging on the wall  the computer 's or the person's? This also begs the question, when technicians are involved in preparing a prescription for dispensing, are they able (and encouraged) to bypass/override an alert message and not ""bother"" the pharmacist? Food for thought!  tute,"" or ""Brand Medically Necessary"" to prevent generic drug interchange when a prescription is written for a brand-name drug.  Disciplinary/Reinstatement Actions Board of Pharmacy Jon S. Bach, RPh, #9345  Board agreed to terminate probation on license effective November 6, 2002. Mark Heisler, RPh, #9834  Board agreed to terminate the suspension of Mr Heisler 's license, to place him on probation, and require continuation of his PAPA contract. Kevin Strychalski, RPh, #9893  license suspended until January 2003 meeting of the Board; five-year PAPA contract, not serve as PIC or preceptor upon reinstatement. Kristine Wells, RPh, #11976  license is voluntarily surrendered pending Board action.  Administrative Rules/Statutes As of November 9, 2002, the ""Drug Therapy Management,"" also known as ""collaborative practice,"" administrative rules are effective. These rules may be viewed on the Board of Pharmacy Web site by clicking on ""ASBP Rules & Statutes,"" then clicking on ""Administrative Code"" and scrolling down to R4-23-421. As expected, the rules are quite ""prescriptive"" as to who has what authority pursuant to written and approved agreements and responsibilities impacting the pharmacist and the responsible medical practitioner. Currently, the venues for such practice agreements are limited to: ""staff model HMOs,"" a ""community health center,"" an ""acute care hospital,"" or a ""nursing care institution."" This legislation provides expanded pharmacy practice opportunities for Arizona pharmacists. The staff at the Board of Pharmacy stands ready to assist interested pharmacists, so do not hesitate to contact your compliance officer or the deputy director for details. The Board has submitted requests for statute changes to be considered in the 2003 legislative session including: controlled substance scheduling changes and enabling statutes paving the way for an electronic controlled substance monitoring program pending future funding. Also in the practice act: licensure of pharmacy technicians, a provision that will serve both the public and the profession by improving the training and proficiency of pharmacy technicians and providing for accountability of the technician to the Board of Pharmacy; pharmacy patient records/privacy/retention requirements, and miscellaneous definition modifications; and increasing the maximum allowable fee for pharmacist license renewal from $150 to $250. Before you reach for the telephone, read on . . . this is not a fee increase but a request to raise the maximum allowable amount the Board may charge for pharmacist license renewal. Likewise, there is also a request to increase the maximum allowable amount for a pharmacy permit from the present $400 to $500 per biennium. The Board will also request to drop the requirement for a two-signature line prescription format and, instead, allow practitioners to indicate ""DAW,"" ""Do Not Substi-  Erratum and Update The October 2002 Newsletter incorrectly stated that the license issued to Deborah Grabowski, RPh #10746, was suspended until January 2003.

General.--Effective on or after July 1, 1988, the services provided by a certified nursemidwife or incident to the certified nurse-midwife's services are covered. Payment is made only under assignment. See 5257 for payment guidelines. B. Certified Nurse-Midwife Defined.--A certified nurse-midwife is a registered nurse who has successfully completed a program of study and clinical experience in nurse-midwifery, meeting guidelines prescribed by the Secretary, or who has been certified by an organization recognized by the Secretary. The Secretary has recognized certification by the American College of NurseMidwives and State qualifying requirements in those States that specify a program of education and clinical experience for nurse-midwives for these purposes. A nurse-midwife must: o o Be currently licensed to practice in the State as a registered professional nurse; and Meet one of the following requirements:  Be legally authorized under State law or regulations to practice as a nursemidwife and have completed a program of study and clinical experience for nurse-midwives, as specified by the State; or If the State does not specify a program of study and clinical experience that nurse-midwives must complete to practice in that State, the nurse-midwife must: Nurse-Midwives; + Be currently certified as a nurse-midwife by the American College of  + Have satisfactorily completed a formal education program (of at least one academic year) that, upon completion, qualifies the nurse to take the certification examination offered by the American College of Nurse-Midwives; or + Have successfully completed a formal education program for preparing registered nurses to furnish gynecological and obstetrical care to women during pregnancy, delivery, and the post partum period, and care to normal newborns, and have practiced as a nurse-midwife for a total of 12 months during any 18-month period from August 8, 1976, to July 16, 1982. C. Covered Services.--  1. General.--Effective January 1, 1988, through December 31, 1993, the coverage of nurse-midwife services was restricted to the maternity cycle. The maternity cycle is a period that includes pregnancy, labor, and the immediate post partum period. Beginning with services furnished on or after January 1, 1994, coverage is no longer limited to the maternity cycle. Coverage is available for services furnished by a nurse-midwife that he or she is legally authorized to perform in the State in which the services are furnished and that would otherwise be covered if furnished by a physician, including obstetrical and gynecological services. 2. Incident To.--Services and supplies furnished incident to a nurse midwife's service are covered if they would have been covered when furnished incident to the services of a doctor of medicine or osteopathy, as described in 2050.  Rev. 1744  2-86.7   2154 (Cont.)  COVERAGE AND LIMITATIONS  03-02  D. Noncovered Services.--The services of nurse-midwives are not covered if they are otherwise excluded from Medicare coverage even though a nurse-midwife is authorized by State law to perform them. For example, the Medicare program excludes from coverage routine physical checkups and services that are not reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury or to improve the functioning of a malformed body member. Coverage of service to the newborn continues only to the point that the newborn is or would normally be treated medically as a separate individual. Items and services furnished the newborn from that point are not covered on the basis of the mother's eligibility. E. Relationship With Physician.--Most States have licensure and other requirements applicable to nurse-midwives. For example, some require that the nurse-midwife have an arrangement with a physician for the referral of the patient in the event a problem develops that requires medical attention. Others may require that the nurse-midwife function under the general supervision of a physician. Although these and similar State requirements must be met in order for the nurse-midwife to provide Medicare covered care, they have no effect on the nurse-midwife's right to personally bill for and receive direct Medicare payment. That is, billing does not have to flow through a physician or facility. See 2050.3 for coverage of services performed by nurse-midwives incident to the service of physicians. F. Place of Service.--There is no restriction on place of service. Therefore, nurse-midwife services are covered if provided in the nurse-midwife's office, in the patient's home, or in a hospital or other facility, such as a clinic or birthing center owned or operated by a nurse-midwife. 2156. PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT SERVICES  Effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 1998, any individual who is participating under the Medicare program as a physician assistant for the first time ever, may have his or her professional services covered if he or she meets the qualifications listed below, and he or she is legally authorized to furnish PA services in the State where the services are performed. PAs who were issued billing provider numbers prior to January 1, 1998, may continue to furnish services under the PA benefit. Payment for PA services is effective on the date of services, that is, on or after January 1, 1998, and payment is made on an assignment-related basis only. A. Qualifications for PAs.--In order to furnish covered PA services, the PA must meet the conditions as follows: 1. Have graduated from a physician assistant educational program that is accredited by the Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant (its predecessor agencies, the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs (CAAHEP) and the Committee on Allied Health Education and Accreditation (CAHEA); or 2. Have passed the national certification examination that is administered by the National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants (NCCPA); and 3. Be licensed by the State to practice as a physician assistant.  2-86.8  Rev. 1744   03-02  COVERAGE AND LIMITATIONS  2156 (Cont.)  B. Covered Services.--Coverage is limited to the services a PA is legally authorized to perform in accordance with State law (or State regulatory mechanism provided by State law). 1. General.--The services of a PA may be covered under Part B, if all of the following requirements are met: o They are the types of services that are considered physician's services if furnished by a doctor of medicine or osteopathy (MD/DO); o The services are performed by a person who meets all of the PA qualifications (see subsection A); and are performed; o The PA is legally authorized to perform the services in the State in which they  o The services are performed under the general supervision of a MD/DO (see subsection C) and o The services are not otherwise precluded from coverage because of one of the statutory exclusions. (See subsection B.4.) 2. Types of PA Services That May Be Covered.--State law or regulations governing a PA's scope of practice in the State where the services are performed applies. Consider developing lists of covered services based on State scope of practice. Examples of the types of services that PAs may furnish include services that traditionally have been reserved to physicians, such as physical examinations, minor surgery, setting casts for simple fractures, interpreting x-rays, and other activities that involve an independent evaluation or treatment of the patient's condition. Also, if authorized under the scope of their State license, PAs may furnish services billed under all levels of CPT evaluation and management codes, and diagnostic tests if furnished under the general supervision of a physician. 3. Incident To.--If covered PA services are furnished, services and supplies furnished incident to the PA's services may also be covered if they would have been covered when furnished incident to the services of an MD/DO, as described in 2050. See 2050.3 for coverage of services performed by PAs incident to the services of physicians. 4. Services Otherwise Excluded From Coverage.--PA services may not be covered if they are otherwise excluded from coverage even though a PA may be authorized by State law to perform them. For example, the Medicare law excludes from coverage routine foot care and, routine physical checkups, and services that are not reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury or to improve the functioning of a malformed body member. Therefore, these services are precluded from coverage even though they may be within a PA's scope of practice under State law. C. Physician Supervision.--The PA's physician supervisor (or a physician designated by the supervising physician or employer as provided under State law or regulations) is primarily responsible for the overall direction and management of the PA's professional activities and for assuring that the services provided are medically appropriate for the patient. The physician supervisor (or physician designee) need not be physically present with the PA when a service is being furnished to a patient and may be contacted by telephone if necessary, unless State law or regulations require otherwise.  Rev. 1744  2-86.9   2158  COVERAGE AND LIMITATIONS  03-02  D. Employment Relationship .-- Payment for services of a PA may be made only to the actual qualified employer of the PA that is eligible to enroll in the Medicare program under existing Medicare provider/supplier categories. If the employer of the PA is a professional corporation or other duly qualified legal entity (such as a limited liability company or a limited liability partnership), properly formed, authorized and licensed under State laws and regulations, that permits PA ownership in such corporation or entity as a stockholder or member, that corporation or entity as the employer may bill for PA services even if a PA is a stockholder or officer of the entity, as long as the entity is entitled to enroll as a ""provider of services"" or a supplier of services in the Medicare program. PAs may not otherwise organize or incorporate and bill for their services directly to the Medicare program, including as, but not limited to as sole proprietorships or general partnerships. Accordingly, a qualified employer is not a group of PAs that incorporate to bill for their services. Leasing agencies and staffing companies do not qualify under the Medicare program as ""providers of services"" or suppliers of services. (See 4112 for billing instructions.) 2158. NURSE PRACTITIONER SERVICES  Effective for services rendered after January 1, 1998, any individual who is participating under the Medicare program as a nurse practitioner (NP) for the first time ever, may have his or her professional services covered if he or she meets the qualifications listed below, and he or she is legally authorized to furnish NP services in the State where the services are performed. NPs who were issued billing provider numbers prior to January 1, 1998 may continue to furnish services under the NP benefit. Payment for NP services is effective on the date of service, that is, on or after January 1, 1998, and payment is made on an assignment-related basis only. A. Qualifications for NPs.-- In order to furnish covered NP services, a NP must meet the conditions as follows: 1. Be a registered professional nurse who is authorized by the State in which the services are furnished to practice as a nurse practitioner in accordance with State law; and Be certified as a nurse practit ioner by a recognized national certifying body that has established standards for nurse practitioners; or 2.

FROM THE INSPECTORS:  Hiring a new pharmacist or technician?: When hiring a pharmacist or technician, ask them if they have ever been disciplined by the State Board of Pharmacy. You may also call the Board to check the license status of a potential employee.  Medical residents and interns: Medical residents and interns may use the teaching hospital's DEA number when writing CDS prescriptions while working at the teaching hospital. These prescriptions may be filled at outside pharmacies. They must use an internal code number in addition to the DEA number which identifies them. An intern's prescription must be countersigned by a physician. A resident's prescription does not have to be countersigned. So that  pharmacies can differentiate between a resident and an intern, the OU Health Science Center has asked the interns and residents to either write ""intern"" or ""resident"" after their name OR to place an ""I"" or ""R"" after the internal code number. (i.e. AB1234567-012R would be a resident prescription and would not have to be countersigned) 2   ERRORS The Board continues to receive complaints on pharmacists and pharmacies regarding ""DISPENSING ERRORS"". Pharmacists need to make a special effort to develop checks and balances that will help prevent dispensing errors from occurring. Errors and ""near misses"" must be used as a learning experience so that similar errors will be avoided in the future. Share and explain these processes to other pharmacists and technicians that work with you. Patients would rather spend some time waiting for the correct medication, than to return later with a misfilled prescription. Time spent making sure a prescription is correct is time well spent. LICENSING OF HOSPITAL DRUG ROOMS BEGINS The Board has started the licensing of Hospital Drug Rooms as of January, 2004. The consultant pharmacist will be required to write guidelines and policies and procedures for the dispensing of medication from the drug room. The rules will allow the predispensing of drugs for the emergency room of these hospitals. There will be better oversight by the pharmacist and more guidelines for the persons working in the drug rooms. The rules for drug rooms are posted on the Board's website on the ""Rules"" page (see ""2003 Revised Rules""). RECENT NEWS ON COMPOUNDING  F.Y.I.  It has been brought to our attention that the FDA has recently filed charges on compounding from bulk chemicals for companion animals. In a recent newsletter we had indicated that the thrust of investigations by the FDA would be on compounding for ""Food Producing Animals"" from bulk chemicals.  The DEA and other government agencies have filed charges against a pharmacy in Arkansas regarding compounding of Morphine I.V. prescriptions. The pharmacy 3   was filling prescriptions for patients and delivering them to the physician's office. The physician was paying the pharmacy $50 to $60 for these prescriptions and then billing Medicare over $1,000. They indicated that the morphine was for office use and had to be sold on a 222 Form. This case has not been resolved at this time. The Board will review the compounding rules during 2004. TECHNICIAN RENEWALS All technician permits expire January 31, 2004. Please remind your technicians that it is their responsibility to keep their license current whether of not they receive a renewal notice. If a renewal notice is not received because of a change of address or for any other reason, they are still subject to the penalty fee. Renewals forms are available from the Board web site, www.pharmacy.state.ok.us , under ""Download Forms""  ""Technicians"". The top reasons why a technician renewal application is returned are: 1. Missing information. Each section requires an answer or a check mark. If any information is missing or left blank, the renewal will be returned. 2. Failure to sign and/or date the renewal application. Working technicians must also have their supervising pharmacist sign their renewal application. 3. Failure to include renewal fee. 4. Failure to submit renewal application on or before the due date. Applications postmarked after February 15, 2004 will be returned and assessed a penalty fee. REMINDER Board rules require that all registrants (pharmacists, technicians and interns) notify the Board in writing of a change of address or employment within ten days.  4   NEW PHARMACISTS New pharmacists licensed by the Board may be viewed on our web site, www.pharmacy.state.ok.us, under ""Announcements.""
