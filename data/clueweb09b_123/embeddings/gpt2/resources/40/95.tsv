This list is also posted on the Inspector General Community's website,   IGNET, at http://www.ignet.gov.

Federal Entities are required to report annually to each House of the     Congress and OMB on audit and investigative activities in their organizations.     Federal Entities are defined as ""any Government corporation (within the meaning     of section 103 (1) of title 5, United States Code), any Government controlled     corporation (within the meaning of section 103 (2) of such title), or any other     entity in the Executive Branch of government, or any independent regulatory     agency"" other than the Executive Office of the President and agencies with     statutory Inspectors General.

GX005-30-4182537	"U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission        PART VII  AGENCY PROFILES   What follows are individual profiles of Cabinet    level, (1)  mid-size, small, and    Defense Department agencies with a work force of 500 or more    employees. These Profiles of Selected Indicators were created    using annual accomplishment reports on minorities, women, and    persons with disabilities, and the Civilian Personnel Data File    (CPDF), which is maintained by the Office of Personnel    Management (OPM). Selected discrimination complaint processing    data submitted by each agency to the EEOC was also used in    creating each profile.   The Profiles of Selected Indicators are a comparison between FY 2001 and FY 2002 data. Each agency's profile highlights the participation by race, national origin, gender, and disability (2)  of employees in its work force and in the agency's top major occupations. The profiles offer data concerning the outcome of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) activities at the pre-complaint and complaint stages of the discrimination complaint process. In the area of discrimination complaint processing, each narrative profile also contains the number of complaints filed, complainants, complaints closed, merit decisions, findings of discrimination, and settlements. Also included are the total amounts of money paid by the agency for corrective actions and settlements, total amounts awarded in specific categories, and the average time it took during for an agency to process complaints.   Immediately following the profile of each agency is an EEO Indicators table containing selected data on the agency's performance for FY 2002. The table highlights discrimination complaint processing activities for each agency and reflects the percentage change in the data provided in FY 2001 and the data provided in FY 2002. (3)   NOTE: The EEOC relies on each agency to provide accurate and reliable data for its complaint processing program. Although the EEOC reviews and analyzes the data submitted, each agency remains ultimately responsible for the accuracy of its own data. Many agencies continue to ignore the Office of Management and Budget's Policy Directive 15 and Circular A-130 when submitting data to the EEOC. As a result, certain discrepancies may appear in the following profiles that the EEOC could not reconcile. (4)     List of Agencies Included in the Agency Profile Section   The following agencies, designated as Cabinet level, Mid-Size, Small, or Department of Defense (DOD), have profiles in this part:       CABINET   MID-SIZE   SMALL   DOD     Agriculture, Department of   Environmental Protection Agency   Agency for International Development   Air Force, Department of the     Commerce, Department of   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   Armed Forces Retirement Home   Army, Department of the     Education, Department of   Federal Emergency Management Agency   Broadcasting Board of Governors   Army and Air Force Exchange Service     Energy, Department of   General Services Agency   Commodity Futures Trading Commission   Defense Commissary Agency     Health and Human Services, Department of   National Aeronautics and Space Administration   Corporation for National Service   Defense Contract Audit Agency     Housing and Urban Development, Department of   Small Business Administration   Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency   Defense Contract Management Agency     Interior, Department of the   Smithsonian Institution   Equal Employment Opportunity Commission   Defense Education Activity     Justice, Department of   Social Security Administration   Federal Communications Commission   Defense Finance and Accounting Service     Labor, Department of   Tennessee Valley Authority   Federal Energy Regulatory Commission   Defense Human Resources Activity     State, Department of     Federal Trade Commission   Defense Information Systems Agency     Transportation, Department of   Government Printing Office   Inspector General, Office of the     Treasury, Department of   National Archives and Records Administration   Defense Logistics Agency     U.S. Postal Service   National Credit Union Administration   Navy, Department of the     Veterans Affairs, Department of   National Gallery of Art   Secretary of Defense, Office of the       National Labor Relations Board   Defense Security Service     National Science Foundation   Defense Threat Reduction Agency     Nuclear Regulatory Commission       Office of Personnel Management     Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation     Railroad Retirement Board     Securities and Exchange Commission   The profiles that follow are listed alphabetically, in the following order:        Agency   Designation     Agency for International Development   Small   Agriculture, Department of    Cabinet   Armed Forces Retirement Home    Small   Broadcasting Board of Governors    Small   Commerce, Department of    Cabinet   Commodity Futures Trading Commission    Small   Corporation for National Service    Small   Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency    Small   Department of Defense Sub-elements:   Air Force, Department of the  DOD   Army, Department of the    DOD   Army and Air Force Exchange Service    DOD   Defense Commissary Agency    DOD   Defense Contract Audit Agency    DOD   Defense Contract Management Agency    DOD   Defense Education Activity    DOD   Defense Finance and Accounting Service    DOD   Defense Human Resources Activity    DOD   Defense Information Systems Agency    DOD   Inspector General, Office of the    DOD   Defense Logistics Agency    DOD   Navy, Department of the    DOD   Secretary of Defense, Office of the    DOD   Defense Security Service    DOD   Defense Threat Reduction Agency    DOD   Education, Department of    Cabinet   Energy, Department of    Cabinet   Environmental Protection Agency    Mid-Size   Equal Employment Opportunity Commission    Small   Federal Communications Commission    Small   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation    Mid-Size   Federal Emergency Management Agency    Mid-Size   Federal Energy Regulatory Commission    Small   Federal Trade Commission    Small   General Services Administration    Mid-Size   Government Printing Office    Small   Health and Human Services, Department of    Cabinet   Housing and Urban Development, Department of    Cabinet   Interior, Department of the    Cabinet   Justice, Department of    Cabinet   Labor, Department of    Cabinet   National Aeronautics and Space Administration    Mid-Size   National Archives and Records Administration    Small   National Credit Union Administration    Small   National Gallery of Art    Small   National Labor Relations Board    Small   National Science Foundation    Small   Nuclear Regulatory Commission    Small   Office of Personnel Management    Small   Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation    Small   Railroad Retirement Board    Small   Securities and Exchange Commission    Small   Small Business Administration    Mid-Size   Smithsonian Institution    Mid-Size   Social Security Administration    Mid-Size   State, Department of    Cabinet   Tennessee Valley Authority    Mid-Size   Transportation, Department of    Cabinet   Treasury, Department of    Cabinet   United States Postal Service    Cabinet   Veterans Affairs, Department of    Cabinet         1.  Because of its size and appointing authority, the U.S. Postal Service was included in the Cabinet level agency category.   2.  Estimated availability for people with targeted disabilities is based on 1990 census data.   3.  This table does not reflect counseling which occurred or settlements reached through agency ADR efforts at the pre-complaint stage.   4.  For example, some agencies provided data on their ""total work force"" which does not correspond with data on the ""permanent work force"" of the agency counted by the OPM (i.e., some agencies reported numbers indicating that their ""total work force"" was smaller than the OPM-counted ""permanent work force"" for that agency).
