Korean  (  /  , see  below ) is the official  language  of  North Korea  and  South Korea . It is also one of the two official languages in the  Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture  in  China . There are about 78 million Korean speakers. It was formerly written using  Hanja , borrowed  Chinese characters  pronounced in the Korean way. In the 15th century a national writing system was developed by  Sejong the Great , nowadays called  Hangul .   The genealogical  classification  of the Korean language is debated. Some linguists place it in the  Altaic  language family, while others consider it to be a  language isolate . It is  agglutinative  in its morphology and  SOV  in its  syntax .

In South Korea, the language is most often called  Hangungmal  (  ;   ), or more formally,  Hangugeo  (  ;   ) or  Gugeo  (  ;   ; literally ""national language"").   In North Korea and Yanbian in China, the language is most often called  Chosnmal  (  ; with  hanja :   ), or more formally,  Chosn  (  ;   ).   On the other hand, Korean people in the  former USSR , who refer to themselves as  Koryo-saram  (also  Goryeoin  [  ;   ; literally, "" Goryeo  person(s)""]) call the language  Goryeomal  (  ;   ).   In  mainland China , following the establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992, the term  Choxiny  (   or short form:  Choy  (  )) has normally been used to refer to the language spoken in North Korea and Yanbian, while  Hnguy  (   or short form:  Hny  (  )) is used to refer to the language spoken in South Korea.   Some older English sources also used the name ""Korean"" to refer to the language, country, and people.     [ edit ]   History   Main article:  History of the Korean language   Korean is descended from  Old Korean  and  Middle Korean .     [ edit ]   Classification   The classification of the modern Korean language is uncertain, and due to the lack of any one generally accepted theory, it is sometimes described conservatively as a  language isolate .   On the other hand, since the publication of the article of  Ramstedt  in 1926, many linguists support the hypothesis that Korean can be classified as an  Altaic  language, or as a relative of proto-Altaic. Korean is similar to Altaic languages in that they both lack certain grammatical elements, including  number ,  gender ,  articles , fusional morphology, voice, and  relative pronouns  (Kim Namkil). Korean especially bears some  morphological  resemblance to some languages of the Northern Turkic group, namely  Sakha (Yakut) . Vinokurova, a scholar of the Sakha language, noted that like in Korean, and unlike in other  Turkic languages  or a variety of other languages surveyed, adverbs in Sakha are derived from verbs with the help of derivational morphology; however, she did not suggest this implied any relation between the two languages. [ 2 ]   It is also considered likely that Korean is related in some way to  Japanese , since the two languages have nearly identical grammatical structures, and share a number of possible phonological cognates (though a majority of them are likely due to local pronunciations of the Chinese characters from which they are derived), as noted by such researchers as  Samuel E. Martin  and  Roy Andrew Miller  in the late 1960s.  Sergei Starostin  (1991) found about 25% of potential cognates in the Japanese-Korean 100-word  Swadesh list , which places these two languages closer together than other possible members of the Altaic family. [ 3 ]   Genetic relationships have been postulated both directly and indirectly, the latter either through placing both languages in the Altaic family, or by arguing for a relationship between Japanese and the  Buyeo languages  of  Goguryeo  and  Baekje  (see below); the proposed Baekje relationship is supported by cognates such as Baekje  mir , Japanese  mi-  ""three"". [ 4 ]   The possible relationship between Korean and Japanese can be exemplified by such basic vocabularly items as J.     mizu  (Old J.  midu ) : K.     mul  (Middle K.  mirh ) ""water"",  mot  ""lake""; J.     ku-ru  ""come"" (Old J.  ku , also cf. irregular root changes as in past tense   ki-ta , negative   ko-nai  in Modern J.) : K.     ka-da  (""go""); J.     kata-i  ""hard"" (whence     kata-na  ""knife, sword"") : K.  kud-yn  (hard); J.     i-ru  ""to be"" (past tense   i-ta ) : K.     i-da  ""to be""; J.  na ,  -en  : K.  anh  ""not"", J.  minna  (Old J.  mynna ) ""all, everyone"" : K.  manh-  ""many"" (predicate  mana-da ), etc.  [ 5 ] . The same possible cognates are often observed in other members of the potential  Altaic family , esp. in the  Tungusic languages . Cf. Nanay  mue  ""water"",  giagda-  ""to walk"",  anaa, anna  ""not"".   Others argue, however, that the similarities are not due to any genetic relationship, but rather to a  sprachbund  effect. [ citation needed ]  See  East Asian languages  for morphological features shared among languages of the East Asian  sprachbund , and  Classification of Japanese  for further details on the possible relationship. Though it is very difficult to believe words such as ""water"", ""to be"", and ""to go"" arise from sprachbund effects.   It is presumed that modern Korean may be more closely related to the languages of  Samhan  and  Silla  than the Buyeo languages; many Korean scholars believe they were mutually intelligible, and the collective basis of what in the  Goryeo  period would merge to become Middle Korean (the language before the changes that the  Seven-Year War  brought) and eventually Modern Korean. The  Jeju dialect  preserves some archaic features that can also be found in Middle Korean, whose  arae a  is retained in the dialect as a distinct vowel.   There are also more marginal hypotheses proposing various other relationships; for example, a few scholars, such as  Homer B. Hulbert  (1905), have tried to relate Korean to the  Dravidian languages  through the similar syntax in both. [ 6 ]   Though not related to Chinese, it has borrowed heavily; see the Vocabulary section below.     [ edit ]   Dialects   Main article:  Korean dialects          Dialects of Korean       Korean has several  dialects  (called  mal  [literally ""speech""],  saturi , or  bang-eon  in Korean). The  standard language  ( pyojuneo  or  pyojunmal ) of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  P'yngyang . All dialects of Korean are similar to each other, and are in fact all mutually intelligible, perhaps with the exception of the dialect of  Jeju Island  (see  Jeju dialect ). The dialect spoken in Jeju is in fact classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of  Seoul dialect  use very little stress, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of the  Gyeongsang dialect  have a very pronounced intonation.   It is also worth noting that there is substantial evidence for a history of extensive  dialect levelling , or even  convergent evolution  or intermixture of two or more originally distinct linguistic stocks, within the Korean language and its dialects. Many Korean dialects have basic vocabulary that is etymologically distinct from vocabulary of identical meaning in Standard Korean or other dialects, such as South Jeolla dialect /kur/ vs. Standard Korean     /ip/  ""mouth"" or Gyeongsang dialect  /.u.i/  vs. Standard Korean  /puu/  "" garlic chives ."" This suggests that the Korean Peninsula may have at one time been much more linguistically diverse than it is at present. See also the  Buyeo languages   hypothesis .   There is a very close connection between the dialects of Korean and the  regions of Korea , since the boundaries of both are largely determined by mountains and seas. Here is a list of traditional dialect names and locations:       Standard dialect   Where used       Seoul   Seoul  (),  Incheon  (/), most of  Gyeonggi  (/)       P'yngan  (/)   P'yngyang ,  P'yngan  region,  Chagang  (North Korea)       Regional dialect   Where used       Gyeonggi   limited areas of the  Gyeonggi  region (South Korea)       Chungcheong   Daejeon ,  Chungcheong  region (South Korea)       Gangwon   Gangwon-do (South Korea) / Kangwn (North Korea)       Gyeongsang   Busan ,  Daegu ,  Ulsan ,  Gyeongsang  region (South Korea)       Hamgyng   Rasn ,  Hamgyng  region,  Ryanggang  (North Korea)       Hwanghae   Hwanghae  region (North Korea)       Jeju   Jeju Island/Province  (South Korea)       Jeolla   Gwangju ,  Jeolla  region (South Korea)         [ edit ]   Phonology       This article contains  IPA  phonetic symbols.

Main article:  Korean phonology     [ edit ]   Consonants          The Korean consonants             Bilabial   Alveolar   Post-  alveolar   Velar   Glottal       Nasal      /m/      /n/        //  (syllable-final)         Plosive  and   Affricate   plain      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         tense      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         aspirated      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         Fricative   plain        /s/          /h/       tense        /s/             Liquid        /l/           The  IPA  symbol <  > (a subscript double straight quotation mark, shown here with a placeholder circle) is used to denote the tensed consonants  /p/, /t/, /k/, //, /s/ . Its official use in the  Extensions to the IPA  is for  'strong'  articulation, but is used in the literature for  faucalized voice . The Korean consonants also have elements of  stiff voice , but it is not yet known how typical this is of faucalized consonants. They are produced with a partially constricted  glottis  and additional subglottal pressure in addition to tense vocal tract walls, laryngeal lowering, or other expansion of the larynx.     [ edit ]   Vowels                    The Korean basic vowels                 Monophthongs   /i/    ,  /e/    ,  //    ,  /a/    ,  /o/    ,  /u/    ,  //    ,  //    ,  //          Vowels preceded by intermediaries,  or Diphthongs   /je/    ,  /j/    ,  /ja/    ,  /wi/    ,  /we/    ,  /w/    ,  /wa/    ,  /i/    ,  /jo/    ,  /ju/    ,  /j/    ,  /w/            [ edit ]   Allophones   /s/  becomes an  alveolo-palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i]  for most speakers (but see  Differences in the language between North Korea and South Korea ). This occurs with the tense fricative and all the affricates as well. At the end of a syllable, /s/ changes to /t/ (Example: beoseot () 'mushroom').   /h/  may become a  bilabial   []  before  [o]  or  [u] , a  palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i] , a  velar   [x]  before  [] , a voiced  []  between voiced sounds, and a  [h]  elsewhere. [ citation needed ]   /p, t, , k/  become voiced  [b, d, , ]  between voiced sounds.   /l/  becomes alveolar flap  []  between vowels, and  [l]  or  []  at the end of a syllable or next to another  /l/ . Note that a written syllable-final '', when followed by a vowel or a glide ( i.e. , when the next character starts with ''), migrates to the next syllable and thus becomes  [] .   Traditionally,  /l/  was disallowed at the beginning of a word. It disappeared before  [j] , and otherwise became  /n/ . However, the inflow of western loanword changed the trend, and now word-initial  /l/  (mostly from English loanwords) are pronounced as a free variation of either  []  or  [l] . The traditional prohibition of word-initial  /l/  became a morphological rule called ""initial law"" () in South Korea, which pertains to Sino-Korean vocabulary. Such words retain their word-initial  /l/  in North Korea.   All  obstruents  (plosives, affricates, fricatives) are  unreleased   [p, t, k]  at the end of a word.   Plosive stops  /p, t, k/  become nasal stops  [m, n, ]  before nasal stops.   Hangul  spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying, partly historical  morphology . Given this, it is sometimes hard to tell which actual phonemes are present in a certain word.   One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial  [r] , and initial  [n] . For example,     ""labour"" - north:  r odong  (), south:  n odong  ()   ""history"" - north:  ry ksa  (), south:  y eoksa  ()   ""female"" - north:  ny ja  (), south:  y eoja  ()       [ edit ]   Morphophonemics   Grammatical morphemes may change shape depending on the preceding sounds. Examples include  -eun/-neun  (-/-) and  -i/-ga  (-/-). Sometimes sounds may be inserted instead. Examples include  -eul/-reul  (-/-),  -euro/-ro  (-/-),  -eseo/-seo  (-/-),  -ideunji/-deunji  (-/-) and  -iya/-ya  (-/-). However,  -euro/-ro  is somewhat irregular, since it will behave differently after a rieul consonant.     Korean particles     After a consonant   After a rieul   After a vowel       -ui  (-)       -eun  (-)   -neun  (-)       -i  (-)   -ga  (-)       -eul  (-)   -reul  (-)       -gwa  (-)   -wa  (-)       -euro  (-)   -ro  (-)       Some verbs may also change shape morphophonemically.     [ edit ]   Grammar   Main article:  Korean grammar     [ edit ]   Sentence structure   Korean is an  agglutinative language . Modifiers generally follow the modified word, and in the case of verb modifiers, can be serially appended. The basic form of a Korean sentence is  Subject Object Verb , but the verb is the only required and immovable element.       A :       -       -? (?)           kage-e     kasseo-yo           store + [location marker ()]     [go (verb root) ()]+[conjunctive ()]+[past ()]+[conjunctive ()]+ [polite marker ()]         ""Did [you] go to the store?"" (with ""you"" implied by context)         B :       .           ye           yes         ""Yes.""       [ edit ]   Parts of speech     [ edit ]   Verb   Korean  verbs  (  ,  tongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""action verbs"" or ""dynamic verbs"" to distinguish them from [  () ,  hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""]), which are also known as ""descriptive verbs"" or ""stative verbs"". Examples of action/dynamic verbs include    ( hada , ""to do"") and    ( kada , ""to go"") which constitute an action or movement as opposed to descriptive verbs such as    ( yehppeuda , ""to be beautiful""). For a larger list of Korean verbs, see  wikt:Category:Korean verbs .   Unlike most of the European languages, Korean does not conjugate verbs using agreement with the subject, and nouns have no gender. Instead, verb conjugations depend upon the verb tense, aspect, mood, and the social relation between the speaker, the subjects, and the listeners. The system of speech levels and honorifics loosely resembles the  T-V distinction  of most  Indo-European languages . For example, different endings are used based on the speaker's relation with the person they are talking to or the person about which they are talking. Politeness is a critical part of Korean language and Korean culture, therefore, when talking to someone esteemed, the correct verb ending, which should have a lot of respect, must be chosen.     [ edit ]   Adjective   Words categorized as Korean  adjectives  (  ,  hyeong-yongsa ,   ) conjugate similarly to verbs, so some English texts call them ""descriptive verbs"" or "" stative verbs "", but they are distinctly separate from    ( tongsa ).   English does not have an identical grammatical category, so the English translation of Korean adjectives may misleadingly suggest that they are verbs. For example,    ( pukda ) translates literally as ""to be red"" and    ( aswipda ) often best translates as ""to lack"" or ""to want for"", but both are    ( hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""). For a larger list of Korean adjectives, see  wikt:Category:Korean adjectives .     [ edit ]   Determiner   Korean  determiners  (  ,  gwanhyeongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""determinatives"", ""adnominals"", ""pre-nouns"", ""attributives"", and ""unconjugated adjectives"". Examples include    ( kak , ""each""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean determiners .     [ edit ]   Noun   A large body of Korean  nouns  (  ,  myeongsa ,   ) stem from  Chinese characters , e.g.    (,  san , mountain),    (,  yeok , station),    (,  munhwa , culture), etc. Others are native to the Korean language, e.g.    ( nara , country),    ( nal , day). Many  Sino-Korean words  have a native Korean equivalent and vice versa, but not always. Nouns do not have  grammatical gender  and can be made  plural  by adding  to the end of the word, however in most instances the  singular  form is used even when in English it would be translated as plural. For example, while in English the sentence  ""there are three apples""  would use the plural  ""apples""  instead of the singular  ""apple"" , the Korean sentence    ( sagwa segae isssumnida ) maintains the word  ( sagwa , ""apple"") in its singular form, thus rendered in English as ""apple three(things) exist."" For a list of Korean nouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean nouns .     [ edit ]   Pronoun   Main article:  Korean pronouns   Korean  pronouns  (  ,  daemyeongsa ,   ) are highly influenced by the honorifics in the language. Pronouns change forms depending on the social status of the person or persons spoken to, e.g. the pronoun for ""I"" there is both the informal    ( na ) and the honorific/humble    ( jeo ). In general second person singular pronouns are avoided, especially when using honorific forms. For a larger list or Korean pronouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean pronouns .     [ edit ]   Adverb   Korean  adverbs  (  ,  busa ,   ) include    ( tto , ""also"") and    ( gadeuk , ""fully""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean adverbs .     [ edit ]   Particle   Korean  particles  (  ,  josa ,   ) are also known in English as "" postpositions "". Examples include    ( neun , topic marker) and    ( reul , object marker). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean particles .     [ edit ]   Interjection   Korean  interjections  (  ,  gamtansa ,   ) are also known in English as ""exclamations"". Examples include    ( ani , ""no""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean interjections .     [ edit ]   Number   Main article:  Korean numerals   Korean  numbers  or numerals (  ,  sutja ,   ) consitute two regularly used sets: a native Korean set and a  Sino-Korean  set. The Sino-Korean system is nearly entirely based on the  Chinese numerals . The distinction between the two numeral systems is very important. Everything that can be counted will use one of the two systems, but seldom both. Sino-Korean words are sometimes used to mark ordinal usage: yeol beon ( ) means ""ten times"" while sip beon (() ()) means ""number ten."" The grouping of large numbers in Korean follow the Chinese tradition of myriads (10000) rather than thousands (1000) as is common in Europe and North America.     [ edit ]   Speech levels and honorifics   Main article:  Korean honorifics   The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean, and the grammar reflects this. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject referent is reflected in  honorifics , while that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in  speech level .     [ edit ]   Honorifics   When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a younger stranger, student, employee or the like. Nowadays, there are special endings which can be used on declarative, interrogative, and imperative sentences; and both honorific or normal sentences. They are made for easier and faster use of Korean.     [ edit ]   Speech levels   There are seven verb  paradigms  or  speech levels  in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation. [ citation needed ]  Unlike  honorifics   which are used to show respect towards the referent   speech levels  are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience. The names of the 7 levels are derived from the non-honorific  imperative  form of the verb    ( hada , ""do"") in each level, plus the suffix  ('che',  hanja :   ), which means ""style.""   The highest 6 levels are generally grouped together as  jondaenmal  (), while the lowest level ( haeche , ) is called  banmal  () in Korean.     [ edit ]   Vocabulary   The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words. Like Japanese and Vietnamese, more than 50% of the vocabulary (up to 60% by some estimates), especially words that denote abstract ideas, are  Sino-Korean words , [ 7 ]  either     directly borrowed from  Written Chinese , or   coined in Japan or Korea using  Chinese characters ,     in a similar way European languages borrow from Latin and Greek. Korean has two  number systems : one native, and one borrowed from Chinese.   To a much lesser extent, words have also occasionally been borrowed from  Mongolian ,  Sanskrit , and other languages. Conversely, the Korean language itself has also contributed some loanwords to other languages, most notably the  Tsushima dialect  of Japanese.   The vast majority of loanwords other than Sino-Korean come from modern times, 90% of which are from  English . [ 8 ]  Many words have also been borrowed from  Japanese  and  Western languages  such as  German  ( areubaiteu  part-time job,  allereugi  allergy). Some Western words were borrowed indirectly via Japanese, taking a Japanese sound pattern, for example dozen >     dsu  >     daseu . Most indirect Western borrowings are now written according to current Hangulization rules for the respective Western language, as if borrowed directly. There are a few more complicated borrowings such as German(y) (see  Names for Germany ), the first part of whose  endonym   [d.lant]  the Japanese approximated using the  kanji      doitsu  that were then accepted into the Korean language by their Sino-Korean pronunciation:     dok  +     il  =  Dogil . In South Korean official use, a number of other Sino-Korean country names have been replaced with phonetically oriented Hangulizations of the countries' endonyms or English names.   North Korean vocabulary shows a tendency to prefer native Korean over Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings, especially with recent political objectives aimed at eliminating foreign (mostly Chinese) influences on the Korean language in the North. By contrast, South Korean may have several Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings which tend to be absent in North Korean.     [ edit ]   Writing system       Korean writing systems           Hangul       Hanja       Hyangchal   Gugyeol   Idu       Mixed script       Korean romanization       Revised Romanization of Korean   McCune-Reischauer   Yale Romanization           Main article:  Hangul   See also:  Hangul consonant and vowel tables   In ancient times, the languages of the Korean peninsula were written using  Chinese characters , using  hyangchal  or  idu . Such systems were not popular because hanja is not well suited to the Korean language. Its use is now limited.   Korean is now mainly written in Hangul, the Korean alphabet promulgated in 1446 by  Sejong the Great ;  hanja may be mixed in  to write  Sino-Korean words . South Korea still teaches 1800 hanja characters in its schools, while the North abolished the use of hanja decades ago.   Below is a chart of the Korean alphabet's symbols and their canonical  IPA  values:     Consonants     Hangul                                                                        RR   b , p   d , t   j   g , k   pp   tt   jj   kk   p   t   ch   k   s   h   ss   m   n   ng       r , l           IPA   p   t      k   p   t      k   p   t      k   s   h   s   m   n      w   r   j         Vowels     Hangul                                                                      RR   i   e   oe   ae   a   o   u   eo   eu   ui   ye   yae   ya   yo   yu   yeo   wi   we   wae   wa   wo       IPA   i   e         a   o   u         i   je   j   ja   jo   ju   j   wi   we   w   wa   w       Modern Korean is written with  spaces  between  words , a feature not found in Chinese or Japanese. Korean  punctuation  marks are almost identical to Western ones. Traditionally, Korean was written in columns from top to bottom, right to left, but is now usually written in rows from left to right, top to bottom.     [ edit ]   Differences between North Korean and South Korean   Main article:  Korean language North-South differences   The Korean language used in the North and the South exhibits differences in pronunciation, spelling, grammar and vocabulary. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Pronunciation   In North Korea,  palatalization  of  /si/  is optional, and  //  can be pronounced as  [z]  in between vowels.   Words that are written the same way may be pronounced differently, such as the examples below. The pronunciations below are given in  Revised Romanization ,  McCune-Reischauer  and Hangul, the last of which represents what the Hangul would be if one writes the word as pronounced.       Word   Meaning   Pronunciation       North (RR/MR)   North (Hangul)   South (RR/MR)   South (Hangul)          wide   neo p tta (n p ta)      neo l tta (n l ta)             to read  (continuative form)   i l kko (i l ko)      i l kko (i l ko)             Amnok River   am r okgang (am r okkang)      am n okkang (am n okkang)             independence   dong r ip (tong r ip)      dong n ip (tong n ip)             idea / sense / conception   gwa ll yeom (kwa ll ym)      gwa nn yeom (kwa nn ym)          *   innovative   hyeoksin jj eok (hyksin tch k)      hyeoksin j eok (hyksin j k)          * Similar pronunciation is used in the North whenever the hanja """" is attached to a Sino-Korean word ending in ,  or . (In the South, this rule only applies when it is attached to any single-character Sino-Korean word.)     [ edit ]   Spelling   Some words are spelled differently by the North and the South, but the pronunciations are the same.       Word spelling   Meaning   Pronunciation (RR/MR)   Remarks       North   South             sunshine   haeppit (haepit)   The ""sai siot"" ('' used for indicating sound change) is almost never written out in the North.             cherry blossom   beotkkot (ptkkot)                cannot read   monnikda (monnikta)   Spacing.             Hallasan   hallasan (hallasan)   When a - combination is pronounced as  ll , the original Hangul spelling is kept in the North, while the Hangul is changed in the South.             rules   gyuyul (kyuyul)   In words where the original hanja is spelt """" or """" and follows a vowel, the initial  is not pronounced in the North, making the pronunciation identical with that in the South where the  is dropped in the spelling.         [ edit ]   Spelling and pronunciation   Some words have different spellings and pronunciations in the North and the South, some of which were given in the ""Phonology"" section above:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          ryeongryang (ryngryang)      yeongnyang (yngnyang)   strength   Korean words originally starting in  r  or  n  have their  r  or  n  dropped in the South Korean version if the sound following it is an  i  or  y  sound.          rodong (rodong)      nodong (nodong)   work   Korean words originally starting in  r  have their  r  changed to  n  in the South Korean version if the sound following it is a sound other than  i  or  y .          wonssu (wnssu)      wonsu (wnsu)   mortal enemy   ""Mortal enemy"" and ""head of state"" are homophones in the South. Possibly to avoid referring to  Kim Il-sung  /  Kim Jong-il  as the enemy, the second syllable of ""enemy"" is written and pronounced  in the North.          rajio (rajio)      radio (radio)   radio            u (u)      wi (wi)   on; above            anhae (anhae)      anae (anae)   wife            kkuba (kkuba)      kuba (k'uba)   Cuba   When transcribing foreign words from languages that do not have contrasts between aspirated and unaspirated stops, North Koreans generally use tensed stops for the unaspirated ones while South Koreans use aspirated stops in both cases.          pe (p'e)      pye (p'ye), pe (p'e)   lungs   All hanja pronounced as  pye  ( p'ye ) or  pe  ( p'e ) in the South are pronounced as  pe  ( p'e ) in the North. The spelling is also accordingly different.       In general, when transcribing place names, North Korea tends to use the pronunciation in the original language more than South Korea, which often uses the pronunciation in English. For example:       Original name   North Korea transliteration   English name   South Korea transliteration       Spelling   Pronunciation   Spelling   Pronunciaton       Ulaanbaatar      ullanbattareu (ullanbattar)   Ulan Bator      ullanbatoreu (ullanbat'or)       Kbenhavn      koeppenhabeun (k'oeppenhabn)   Copenhagen      kopenhagen (k'op'enhagen)       al-Qhirah      kkahira (kkahira)   Cairo      kairo (k'airo)         [ edit ]   Grammar   Some grammatical constructions are also different:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          doeyeotda (toeytta)      doeeotda (toetta)   past tense of  (doeda/toeda), ""to become""   All similar grammar forms of verbs or adjectives that end in  in the stem (i.e. , , , ,  and ) in the North use  instead of the South's .          gomawayo (komawayo)      gomawoyo (komawyo)   thanks   -irregular verbs in the North use  (wa) for all those with a positive ending vowel; this only happens in the South if the verb stem has only one syllable.          halgayo (halkayo)      halkkayo (halkkayo)   Shall we do?   Although the Hangul differ, the pronunciations are the same (i.e. with the tensed  sound).         [ edit ]   Vocabulary   Some vocabulary is different between the North and the South:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          munhwajutaek (munhwajut'aek)      apateu (ap'at')   Apartment     (appateu/appat') is also used in the North.          joseonmal (chosnmal)      han-gugeo(han'gugeo)   Korean language            gwakbap (kwakpap)      dosirak (tosirak)   lunch box           [ edit ]   Others   In the North,  guillemets     and    are the symbols used for quotes; in the South, quotation marks equivalent to the English ones,  and , are standard, although     and     are sometimes used in popular novels.     [ edit ]   Study by non-native speakers   The  United States '  Defense Language Institute  classifies Korean alongside  Arabic ,  Chinese , and  Japanese  as a Category IV language, meaning that 63 weeks of instruction (as compared to just 25 weeks for  French ,  Spanish ,  Portuguese , and  Italian ) are required to bring an English-speaking student to a limited working level of proficiency in which he or she has ""sufficient capability to meet routine social demands and limited job requirements"" and ""can deal with concrete topics in past, present, and future tense."" [ 10 ]  As a result, the study of the Korean language in the United States is dominated by  Korean American  heritage language students; they are estimated to form over 80% of all students of the language at non-military universities. [ 11 ]   However, Korean is considerably easier for speakers of certain other languages, such as Japanese, Mongolian and Turkic languages; in Japan, it is more widely studied by non-heritage learners. [ 12 ]  The  Korean Language Proficiency Test , an examination aimed at assessing non-native speakers' competence in Korean, was instituted in 1997; 17,000 people applied for the 2005 sitting of the examination.

Korean  (  /  , see  below ) is the official  language  of  North Korea  and  South Korea . It is also one of the two official languages in the  Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture  in  China . There are about 78 million Korean speakers. It was formerly written using  Hanja , borrowed  Chinese characters  pronounced in the Korean way. In the 15th century a national writing system was developed by  Sejong the Great , nowadays called  Hangul .   The genealogical  classification  of the Korean language is debated.

In North Korea and Yanbian in China, the language is most often called  Chosnmal  (  ; with  hanja :   ), or more formally,  Chosn  (  ;   ).   On the other hand, Korean people in the  former USSR , who refer to themselves as  Koryo-saram  (also  Goryeoin  [  ;   ; literally, "" Goryeo  person(s)""]) call the language  Goryeomal  (  ;   ).   In  mainland China , following the establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992, the term  Choxiny  (   or short form:  Choy  (  )) has normally been used to refer to the language spoken in North Korea and Yanbian, while  Hnguy  (   or short form:  Hny  (  )) is used to refer to the language spoken in South Korea.   Some older English sources also used the name ""Korean"" to refer to the language, country, and people.     [ edit ]   History   Main article:  History of the Korean language   Korean is descended from  Old Korean  and  Middle Korean .     [ edit ]   Classification   The classification of the modern Korean language is uncertain, and due to the lack of any one generally accepted theory, it is sometimes described conservatively as a  language isolate .   On the other hand, since the publication of the article of  Ramstedt  in 1926, many linguists support the hypothesis that Korean can be classified as an  Altaic  language, or as a relative of proto-Altaic. Korean is similar to Altaic languages in that they both lack certain grammatical elements, including  number ,  gender ,  articles , fusional morphology, voice, and  relative pronouns  (Kim Namkil). Korean especially bears some  morphological  resemblance to some languages of the Northern Turkic group, namely  Sakha (Yakut) . Vinokurova, a scholar of the Sakha language, noted that like in Korean, and unlike in other  Turkic languages  or a variety of other languages surveyed, adverbs in Sakha are derived from verbs with the help of derivational morphology; however, she did not suggest this implied any relation between the two languages. [ 2 ]   It is also considered likely that Korean is related in some way to  Japanese , since the two languages have nearly identical grammatical structures, and share a number of possible phonological cognates (though a majority of them are likely due to local pronunciations of the Chinese characters from which they are derived), as noted by such researchers as  Samuel E. Martin  and  Roy Andrew Miller  in the late 1960s.  Sergei Starostin  (1991) found about 25% of potential cognates in the Japanese-Korean 100-word  Swadesh list , which places these two languages closer together than other possible members of the Altaic family. [ 3 ]   Genetic relationships have been postulated both directly and indirectly, the latter either through placing both languages in the Altaic family, or by arguing for a relationship between Japanese and the  Buyeo languages  of  Goguryeo  and  Baekje  (see below); the proposed Baekje relationship is supported by cognates such as Baekje  mir , Japanese  mi-  ""three"". [ 4 ]   The possible relationship between Korean and Japanese can be exemplified by such basic vocabularly items as J.     mizu  (Old J.  midu ) : K.     mul  (Middle K.  mirh ) ""water"",  mot  ""lake""; J.     ku-ru  ""come"" (Old J.  ku , also cf. irregular root changes as in past tense   ki-ta , negative   ko-nai  in Modern J.) : K.     ka-da  (""go""); J.     kata-i  ""hard"" (whence     kata-na  ""knife, sword"") : K.  kud-yn  (hard); J.     i-ru  ""to be"" (past tense   i-ta ) : K.     i-da  ""to be""; J.  na ,  -en  : K.  anh  ""not"", J.  minna  (Old J.  mynna ) ""all, everyone"" : K.  manh-  ""many"" (predicate  mana-da ), etc.  [ 5 ] . The same possible cognates are often observed in other members of the potential  Altaic family , esp. in the  Tungusic languages . Cf. Nanay  mue  ""water"",  giagda-  ""to walk"",  anaa, anna  ""not"".   Others argue, however, that the similarities are not due to any genetic relationship, but rather to a  sprachbund  effect. [ citation needed ]  See  East Asian languages  for morphological features shared among languages of the East Asian  sprachbund , and  Classification of Japanese  for further details on the possible relationship. Though it is very difficult to believe words such as ""water"", ""to be"", and ""to go"" arise from sprachbund effects.   It is presumed that modern Korean may be more closely related to the languages of  Samhan  and  Silla  than the Buyeo languages; many Korean scholars believe they were mutually intelligible, and the collective basis of what in the  Goryeo  period would merge to become Middle Korean (the language before the changes that the  Seven-Year War  brought) and eventually Modern Korean. The  Jeju dialect  preserves some archaic features that can also be found in Middle Korean, whose  arae a  is retained in the dialect as a distinct vowel.   There are also more marginal hypotheses proposing various other relationships; for example, a few scholars, such as  Homer B. Hulbert  (1905), have tried to relate Korean to the  Dravidian languages  through the similar syntax in both. [ 6 ]   Though not related to Chinese, it has borrowed heavily; see the Vocabulary section below.     [ edit ]   Dialects   Main article:  Korean dialects          Dialects of Korean       Korean has several  dialects  (called  mal  [literally ""speech""],  saturi , or  bang-eon  in Korean). The  standard language  ( pyojuneo  or  pyojunmal ) of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  P'yngyang . All dialects of Korean are similar to each other, and are in fact all mutually intelligible, perhaps with the exception of the dialect of  Jeju Island  (see  Jeju dialect ). The dialect spoken in Jeju is in fact classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of  Seoul dialect  use very little stress, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of the  Gyeongsang dialect  have a very pronounced intonation.   It is also worth noting that there is substantial evidence for a history of extensive  dialect levelling , or even  convergent evolution  or intermixture of two or more originally distinct linguistic stocks, within the Korean language and its dialects. Many Korean dialects have basic vocabulary that is etymologically distinct from vocabulary of identical meaning in Standard Korean or other dialects, such as South Jeolla dialect /kur/ vs. Standard Korean     /ip/  ""mouth"" or Gyeongsang dialect  /.u.i/  vs. Standard Korean  /puu/  "" garlic chives ."" This suggests that the Korean Peninsula may have at one time been much more linguistically diverse than it is at present. See also the  Buyeo languages   hypothesis .   There is a very close connection between the dialects of Korean and the  regions of Korea , since the boundaries of both are largely determined by mountains and seas. Here is a list of traditional dialect names and locations:       Standard dialect   Where used       Seoul   Seoul  (),  Incheon  (/), most of  Gyeonggi  (/)       P'yngan  (/)   P'yngyang ,  P'yngan  region,  Chagang  (North Korea)       Regional dialect   Where used       Gyeonggi   limited areas of the  Gyeonggi  region (South Korea)       Chungcheong   Daejeon ,  Chungcheong  region (South Korea)       Gangwon   Gangwon-do (South Korea) / Kangwn (North Korea)       Gyeongsang   Busan ,  Daegu ,  Ulsan ,  Gyeongsang  region (South Korea)       Hamgyng   Rasn ,  Hamgyng  region,  Ryanggang  (North Korea)       Hwanghae   Hwanghae  region (North Korea)       Jeju   Jeju Island/Province  (South Korea)       Jeolla   Gwangju ,  Jeolla  region (South Korea)         [ edit ]   Phonology       This article contains  IPA  phonetic symbols.

Main article:  Korean phonology     [ edit ]   Consonants          The Korean consonants             Bilabial   Alveolar   Post-  alveolar   Velar   Glottal       Nasal      /m/      /n/        //  (syllable-final)         Plosive  and   Affricate   plain      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         tense      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         aspirated      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         Fricative   plain        /s/          /h/       tense        /s/             Liquid        /l/           The  IPA  symbol <  > (a subscript double straight quotation mark, shown here with a placeholder circle) is used to denote the tensed consonants  /p/, /t/, /k/, //, /s/ . Its official use in the  Extensions to the IPA  is for  'strong'  articulation, but is used in the literature for  faucalized voice . The Korean consonants also have elements of  stiff voice , but it is not yet known how typical this is of faucalized consonants. They are produced with a partially constricted  glottis  and additional subglottal pressure in addition to tense vocal tract walls, laryngeal lowering, or other expansion of the larynx.     [ edit ]   Vowels                    The Korean basic vowels                 Monophthongs   /i/    ,  /e/    ,  //    ,  /a/    ,  /o/    ,  /u/    ,  //    ,  //    ,  //          Vowels preceded by intermediaries,  or Diphthongs   /je/    ,  /j/    ,  /ja/    ,  /wi/    ,  /we/    ,  /w/    ,  /wa/    ,  /i/    ,  /jo/    ,  /ju/    ,  /j/    ,  /w/            [ edit ]   Allophones   /s/  becomes an  alveolo-palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i]  for most speakers (but see  Differences in the language between North Korea and South Korea ). This occurs with the tense fricative and all the affricates as well. At the end of a syllable, /s/ changes to /t/ (Example: beoseot () 'mushroom').   /h/  may become a  bilabial   []  before  [o]  or  [u] , a  palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i] , a  velar   [x]  before  [] , a voiced  []  between voiced sounds, and a  [h]  elsewhere. [ citation needed ]   /p, t, , k/  become voiced  [b, d, , ]  between voiced sounds.   /l/  becomes alveolar flap  []  between vowels, and  [l]  or  []  at the end of a syllable or next to another  /l/ . Note that a written syllable-final '', when followed by a vowel or a glide ( i.e. , when the next character starts with ''), migrates to the next syllable and thus becomes  [] .   Traditionally,  /l/  was disallowed at the beginning of a word. It disappeared before  [j] , and otherwise became  /n/ . However, the inflow of western loanword changed the trend, and now word-initial  /l/  (mostly from English loanwords) are pronounced as a free variation of either  []  or  [l] . The traditional prohibition of word-initial  /l/  became a morphological rule called ""initial law"" () in South Korea, which pertains to Sino-Korean vocabulary. Such words retain their word-initial  /l/  in North Korea.   All  obstruents  (plosives, affricates, fricatives) are  unreleased   [p, t, k]  at the end of a word.   Plosive stops  /p, t, k/  become nasal stops  [m, n, ]  before nasal stops.   Hangul  spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying, partly historical  morphology . Given this, it is sometimes hard to tell which actual phonemes are present in a certain word.   One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial  [r] , and initial  [n] . For example,     ""labour"" - north:  r odong  (), south:  n odong  ()   ""history"" - north:  ry ksa  (), south:  y eoksa  ()   ""female"" - north:  ny ja  (), south:  y eoja  ()       [ edit ]   Morphophonemics   Grammatical morphemes may change shape depending on the preceding sounds. Examples include  -eun/-neun  (-/-) and  -i/-ga  (-/-). Sometimes sounds may be inserted instead. Examples include  -eul/-reul  (-/-),  -euro/-ro  (-/-),  -eseo/-seo  (-/-),  -ideunji/-deunji  (-/-) and  -iya/-ya  (-/-). However,  -euro/-ro  is somewhat irregular, since it will behave differently after a rieul consonant.     Korean particles     After a consonant   After a rieul   After a vowel       -ui  (-)       -eun  (-)   -neun  (-)       -i  (-)   -ga  (-)       -eul  (-)   -reul  (-)       -gwa  (-)   -wa  (-)       -euro  (-)   -ro  (-)       Some verbs may also change shape morphophonemically.     [ edit ]   Grammar   Main article:  Korean grammar     [ edit ]   Sentence structure   Korean is an  agglutinative language . Modifiers generally follow the modified word, and in the case of verb modifiers, can be serially appended. The basic form of a Korean sentence is  Subject Object Verb , but the verb is the only required and immovable element.       A :       -       -? (?)           kage-e     kasseo-yo           store + [location marker ()]     [go (verb root) ()]+[conjunctive ()]+[past ()]+[conjunctive ()]+ [polite marker ()]         ""Did [you] go to the store?"" (with ""you"" implied by context)         B :       .           ye           yes         ""Yes.""       [ edit ]   Parts of speech     [ edit ]   Verb   Korean  verbs  (  ,  tongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""action verbs"" or ""dynamic verbs"" to distinguish them from [  () ,  hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""]), which are also known as ""descriptive verbs"" or ""stative verbs"". Examples of action/dynamic verbs include    ( hada , ""to do"") and    ( kada , ""to go"") which constitute an action or movement as opposed to descriptive verbs such as    ( yehppeuda , ""to be beautiful""). For a larger list of Korean verbs, see  wikt:Category:Korean verbs .   Unlike most of the European languages, Korean does not conjugate verbs using agreement with the subject, and nouns have no gender. Instead, verb conjugations depend upon the verb tense, aspect, mood, and the social relation between the speaker, the subjects, and the listeners. The system of speech levels and honorifics loosely resembles the  T-V distinction  of most  Indo-European languages . For example, different endings are used based on the speaker's relation with the person they are talking to or the person about which they are talking. Politeness is a critical part of Korean language and Korean culture, therefore, when talking to someone esteemed, the correct verb ending, which should have a lot of respect, must be chosen.     [ edit ]   Adjective   Words categorized as Korean  adjectives  (  ,  hyeong-yongsa ,   ) conjugate similarly to verbs, so some English texts call them ""descriptive verbs"" or "" stative verbs "", but they are distinctly separate from    ( tongsa ).   English does not have an identical grammatical category, so the English translation of Korean adjectives may misleadingly suggest that they are verbs. For example,    ( pukda ) translates literally as ""to be red"" and    ( aswipda ) often best translates as ""to lack"" or ""to want for"", but both are    ( hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""). For a larger list of Korean adjectives, see  wikt:Category:Korean adjectives .     [ edit ]   Determiner   Korean  determiners  (  ,  gwanhyeongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""determinatives"", ""adnominals"", ""pre-nouns"", ""attributives"", and ""unconjugated adjectives"". Examples include    ( kak , ""each""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean determiners .     [ edit ]   Noun   A large body of Korean  nouns  (  ,  myeongsa ,   ) stem from  Chinese characters , e.g.    (,  san , mountain),    (,  yeok , station),    (,  munhwa , culture), etc. Others are native to the Korean language, e.g.    ( nara , country),    ( nal , day). Many  Sino-Korean words  have a native Korean equivalent and vice versa, but not always. Nouns do not have  grammatical gender  and can be made  plural  by adding  to the end of the word, however in most instances the  singular  form is used even when in English it would be translated as plural. For example, while in English the sentence  ""there are three apples""  would use the plural  ""apples""  instead of the singular  ""apple"" , the Korean sentence    ( sagwa segae isssumnida ) maintains the word  ( sagwa , ""apple"") in its singular form, thus rendered in English as ""apple three(things) exist."" For a list of Korean nouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean nouns .     [ edit ]   Pronoun   Main article:  Korean pronouns   Korean  pronouns  (  ,  daemyeongsa ,   ) are highly influenced by the honorifics in the language. Pronouns change forms depending on the social status of the person or persons spoken to, e.g. the pronoun for ""I"" there is both the informal    ( na ) and the honorific/humble    ( jeo ). In general second person singular pronouns are avoided, especially when using honorific forms. For a larger list or Korean pronouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean pronouns .     [ edit ]   Adverb   Korean  adverbs  (  ,  busa ,   ) include    ( tto , ""also"") and    ( gadeuk , ""fully""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean adverbs .     [ edit ]   Particle   Korean  particles  (  ,  josa ,   ) are also known in English as "" postpositions "". Examples include    ( neun , topic marker) and    ( reul , object marker). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean particles .     [ edit ]   Interjection   Korean  interjections  (  ,  gamtansa ,   ) are also known in English as ""exclamations"". Examples include    ( ani , ""no""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean interjections .     [ edit ]   Number   Main article:  Korean numerals   Korean  numbers  or numerals (  ,  sutja ,   ) consitute two regularly used sets: a native Korean set and a  Sino-Korean  set. The Sino-Korean system is nearly entirely based on the  Chinese numerals . The distinction between the two numeral systems is very important. Everything that can be counted will use one of the two systems, but seldom both. Sino-Korean words are sometimes used to mark ordinal usage: yeol beon ( ) means ""ten times"" while sip beon (() ()) means ""number ten."" The grouping of large numbers in Korean follow the Chinese tradition of myriads (10000) rather than thousands (1000) as is common in Europe and North America.     [ edit ]   Speech levels and honorifics   Main article:  Korean honorifics   The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean, and the grammar reflects this. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject referent is reflected in  honorifics , while that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in  speech level .     [ edit ]   Honorifics   When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a younger stranger, student, employee or the like. Nowadays, there are special endings which can be used on declarative, interrogative, and imperative sentences; and both honorific or normal sentences. They are made for easier and faster use of Korean.     [ edit ]   Speech levels   There are seven verb  paradigms  or  speech levels  in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation. [ citation needed ]  Unlike  honorifics   which are used to show respect towards the referent   speech levels  are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience. The names of the 7 levels are derived from the non-honorific  imperative  form of the verb    ( hada , ""do"") in each level, plus the suffix  ('che',  hanja :   ), which means ""style.""   The highest 6 levels are generally grouped together as  jondaenmal  (), while the lowest level ( haeche , ) is called  banmal  () in Korean.     [ edit ]   Vocabulary   The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words. Like Japanese and Vietnamese, more than 50% of the vocabulary (up to 60% by some estimates), especially words that denote abstract ideas, are  Sino-Korean words , [ 7 ]  either     directly borrowed from  Written Chinese , or   coined in Japan or Korea using  Chinese characters ,     in a similar way European languages borrow from Latin and Greek. Korean has two  number systems : one native, and one borrowed from Chinese.   To a much lesser extent, words have also occasionally been borrowed from  Mongolian ,  Sanskrit , and other languages. Conversely, the Korean language itself has also contributed some loanwords to other languages, most notably the  Tsushima dialect  of Japanese.   The vast majority of loanwords other than Sino-Korean come from modern times, 90% of which are from  English . [ 8 ]  Many words have also been borrowed from  Japanese  and  Western languages  such as  German  ( areubaiteu  part-time job,  allereugi  allergy). Some Western words were borrowed indirectly via Japanese, taking a Japanese sound pattern, for example dozen >     dsu  >     daseu . Most indirect Western borrowings are now written according to current Hangulization rules for the respective Western language, as if borrowed directly. There are a few more complicated borrowings such as German(y) (see  Names for Germany ), the first part of whose  endonym   [d.lant]  the Japanese approximated using the  kanji      doitsu  that were then accepted into the Korean language by their Sino-Korean pronunciation:     dok  +     il  =  Dogil . In South Korean official use, a number of other Sino-Korean country names have been replaced with phonetically oriented Hangulizations of the countries' endonyms or English names.   North Korean vocabulary shows a tendency to prefer native Korean over Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings, especially with recent political objectives aimed at eliminating foreign (mostly Chinese) influences on the Korean language in the North. By contrast, South Korean may have several Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings which tend to be absent in North Korean.

Such systems were not popular because hanja is not well suited to the Korean language. Its use is now limited.   Korean is now mainly written in Hangul, the Korean alphabet promulgated in 1446 by  Sejong the Great ;  hanja may be mixed in  to write  Sino-Korean words . South Korea still teaches 1800 hanja characters in its schools, while the North abolished the use of hanja decades ago.

Korean  punctuation  marks are almost identical to Western ones. Traditionally, Korean was written in columns from top to bottom, right to left, but is now usually written in rows from left to right, top to bottom.     [ edit ]   Differences between North Korean and South Korean   Main article:  Korean language North-South differences   The Korean language used in the North and the South exhibits differences in pronunciation, spelling, grammar and vocabulary. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Pronunciation   In North Korea,  palatalization  of  /si/  is optional, and  //  can be pronounced as  [z]  in between vowels.   Words that are written the same way may be pronounced differently, such as the examples below. The pronunciations below are given in  Revised Romanization ,  McCune-Reischauer  and Hangul, the last of which represents what the Hangul would be if one writes the word as pronounced.

(In the South, this rule only applies when it is attached to any single-character Sino-Korean word.)     [ edit ]   Spelling   Some words are spelled differently by the North and the South, but the pronunciations are the same.

[ edit ]   Spelling and pronunciation   Some words have different spellings and pronunciations in the North and the South, some of which were given in the ""Phonology"" section above:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          ryeongryang (ryngryang)      yeongnyang (yngnyang)   strength   Korean words originally starting in  r  or  n  have their  r  or  n  dropped in the South Korean version if the sound following it is an  i  or  y  sound.          rodong (rodong)      nodong (nodong)   work   Korean words originally starting in  r  have their  r  changed to  n  in the South Korean version if the sound following it is a sound other than  i  or  y .          wonssu (wnssu)      wonsu (wnsu)   mortal enemy   ""Mortal enemy"" and ""head of state"" are homophones in the South. Possibly to avoid referring to  Kim Il-sung  /  Kim Jong-il  as the enemy, the second syllable of ""enemy"" is written and pronounced  in the North.          rajio (rajio)      radio (radio)   radio            u (u)      wi (wi)   on; above            anhae (anhae)      anae (anae)   wife            kkuba (kkuba)      kuba (k'uba)   Cuba   When transcribing foreign words from languages that do not have contrasts between aspirated and unaspirated stops, North Koreans generally use tensed stops for the unaspirated ones while South Koreans use aspirated stops in both cases.          pe (p'e)      pye (p'ye), pe (p'e)   lungs   All hanja pronounced as  pye  ( p'ye ) or  pe  ( p'e ) in the South are pronounced as  pe  ( p'e ) in the North. The spelling is also accordingly different.       In general, when transcribing place names, North Korea tends to use the pronunciation in the original language more than South Korea, which often uses the pronunciation in English.

Although the Hangul differ, the pronunciations are the same (i.e. with the tensed  sound).

[ edit ]   Study by non-native speakers   The  United States '  Defense Language Institute  classifies Korean alongside  Arabic ,  Chinese , and  Japanese  as a Category IV language, meaning that 63 weeks of instruction (as compared to just 25 weeks for  French ,  Spanish ,  Portuguese , and  Italian ) are required to bring an English-speaking student to a limited working level of proficiency in which he or she has ""sufficient capability to meet routine social demands and limited job requirements"" and ""can deal with concrete topics in past, present, and future tense."" [ 10 ]  As a result, the study of the Korean language in the United States is dominated by  Korean American  heritage language students; they are estimated to form over 80% of all students of the language at non-military universities. [ 11 ]   However, Korean is considerably easier for speakers of certain other languages, such as Japanese, Mongolian and Turkic languages; in Japan, it is more widely studied by non-heritage learners. [ 12 ]  The  Korean Language Proficiency Test , an examination aimed at assessing non-native speakers' competence in Korean, was instituted in 1997; 17,000 people applied for the 2005 sitting of the examination.

Korean  (  /  , see  below ) is the official  language  of  North Korea  and  South Korea . It is also one of the two official languages in the  Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture  in  China . There are about 78 million Korean speakers. It was formerly written using  Hanja , borrowed  Chinese characters  pronounced in the Korean way. In the 15th century a national writing system was developed by  Sejong the Great , nowadays called  Hangul .   The genealogical  classification  of the Korean language is debated. Some linguists place it in the  Altaic  language family, while others consider it to be a  language isolate . It is  agglutinative  in its morphology and  SOV  in its  syntax .

In South Korea, the language is most often called  Hangungmal  (  ;   ), or more formally,  Hangugeo  (  ;   ) or  Gugeo  (  ;   ; literally ""national language"").   In North Korea and Yanbian in China, the language is most often called  Chosnmal  (  ; with  hanja :   ), or more formally,  Chosn  (  ;   ).   On the other hand, Korean people in the  former USSR , who refer to themselves as  Koryo-saram  (also  Goryeoin  [  ;   ; literally, "" Goryeo  person(s)""]) call the language  Goryeomal  (  ;   ).   In  mainland China , following the establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992, the term  Choxiny  (   or short form:  Choy  (  )) has normally been used to refer to the language spoken in North Korea and Yanbian, while  Hnguy  (   or short form:  Hny  (  )) is used to refer to the language spoken in South Korea.   Some older English sources also used the name ""Korean"" to refer to the language, country, and people.     [ edit ]   History   Main article:  History of the Korean language   Korean is descended from  Old Korean  and  Middle Korean .     [ edit ]   Classification   The classification of the modern Korean language is uncertain, and due to the lack of any one generally accepted theory, it is sometimes described conservatively as a  language isolate .   On the other hand, since the publication of the article of  Ramstedt  in 1926, many linguists support the hypothesis that Korean can be classified as an  Altaic  language, or as a relative of proto-Altaic. Korean is similar to Altaic languages in that they both lack certain grammatical elements, including  number ,  gender ,  articles , fusional morphology, voice, and  relative pronouns  (Kim Namkil). Korean especially bears some  morphological  resemblance to some languages of the Northern Turkic group, namely  Sakha (Yakut) . Vinokurova, a scholar of the Sakha language, noted that like in Korean, and unlike in other  Turkic languages  or a variety of other languages surveyed, adverbs in Sakha are derived from verbs with the help of derivational morphology; however, she did not suggest this implied any relation between the two languages. [ 2 ]   It is also considered likely that Korean is related in some way to  Japanese , since the two languages have nearly identical grammatical structures, and share a number of possible phonological cognates (though a majority of them are likely due to local pronunciations of the Chinese characters from which they are derived), as noted by such researchers as  Samuel E. Martin  and  Roy Andrew Miller  in the late 1960s.  Sergei Starostin  (1991) found about 25% of potential cognates in the Japanese-Korean 100-word  Swadesh list , which places these two languages closer together than other possible members of the Altaic family. [ 3 ]   Genetic relationships have been postulated both directly and indirectly, the latter either through placing both languages in the Altaic family, or by arguing for a relationship between Japanese and the  Buyeo languages  of  Goguryeo  and  Baekje  (see below); the proposed Baekje relationship is supported by cognates such as Baekje  mir , Japanese  mi-  ""three"". [ 4 ]   The possible relationship between Korean and Japanese can be exemplified by such basic vocabularly items as J.     mizu  (Old J.  midu ) : K.     mul  (Middle K.  mirh ) ""water"",  mot  ""lake""; J.     ku-ru  ""come"" (Old J.  ku , also cf. irregular root changes as in past tense   ki-ta , negative   ko-nai  in Modern J.) : K.     ka-da  (""go""); J.     kata-i  ""hard"" (whence     kata-na  ""knife, sword"") : K.  kud-yn  (hard); J.     i-ru  ""to be"" (past tense   i-ta ) : K.     i-da  ""to be""; J.  na ,  -en  : K.  anh  ""not"", J.  minna  (Old J.  mynna ) ""all, everyone"" : K.  manh-  ""many"" (predicate  mana-da ), etc.  [ 5 ] . The same possible cognates are often observed in other members of the potential  Altaic family , esp. in the  Tungusic languages . Cf. Nanay  mue  ""water"",  giagda-  ""to walk"",  anaa, anna  ""not"".   Others argue, however, that the similarities are not due to any genetic relationship, but rather to a  sprachbund  effect. [ citation needed ]  See  East Asian languages  for morphological features shared among languages of the East Asian  sprachbund , and  Classification of Japanese  for further details on the possible relationship. Though it is very difficult to believe words such as ""water"", ""to be"", and ""to go"" arise from sprachbund effects.   It is presumed that modern Korean may be more closely related to the languages of  Samhan  and  Silla  than the Buyeo languages; many Korean scholars believe they were mutually intelligible, and the collective basis of what in the  Goryeo  period would merge to become Middle Korean (the language before the changes that the  Seven-Year War  brought) and eventually Modern Korean. The  Jeju dialect  preserves some archaic features that can also be found in Middle Korean, whose  arae a  is retained in the dialect as a distinct vowel.   There are also more marginal hypotheses proposing various other relationships; for example, a few scholars, such as  Homer B. Hulbert  (1905), have tried to relate Korean to the  Dravidian languages  through the similar syntax in both. [ 6 ]   Though not related to Chinese, it has borrowed heavily; see the Vocabulary section below.     [ edit ]   Dialects   Main article:  Korean dialects          Dialects of Korean       Korean has several  dialects  (called  mal  [literally ""speech""],  saturi , or  bang-eon  in Korean). The  standard language  ( pyojuneo  or  pyojunmal ) of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  P'yngyang . All dialects of Korean are similar to each other, and are in fact all mutually intelligible, perhaps with the exception of the dialect of  Jeju Island  (see  Jeju dialect ). The dialect spoken in Jeju is in fact classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of  Seoul dialect  use very little stress, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of the  Gyeongsang dialect  have a very pronounced intonation.   It is also worth noting that there is substantial evidence for a history of extensive  dialect levelling , or even  convergent evolution  or intermixture of two or more originally distinct linguistic stocks, within the Korean language and its dialects. Many Korean dialects have basic vocabulary that is etymologically distinct from vocabulary of identical meaning in Standard Korean or other dialects, such as South Jeolla dialect /kur/ vs. Standard Korean     /ip/  ""mouth"" or Gyeongsang dialect  /.u.i/  vs. Standard Korean  /puu/  "" garlic chives ."" This suggests that the Korean Peninsula may have at one time been much more linguistically diverse than it is at present. See also the  Buyeo languages   hypothesis .   There is a very close connection between the dialects of Korean and the  regions of Korea , since the boundaries of both are largely determined by mountains and seas. Here is a list of traditional dialect names and locations:       Standard dialect   Where used       Seoul   Seoul  (),  Incheon  (/), most of  Gyeonggi  (/)       P'yngan  (/)   P'yngyang ,  P'yngan  region,  Chagang  (North Korea)       Regional dialect   Where used       Gyeonggi   limited areas of the  Gyeonggi  region (South Korea)       Chungcheong   Daejeon ,  Chungcheong  region (South Korea)       Gangwon   Gangwon-do (South Korea) / Kangwn (North Korea)       Gyeongsang   Busan ,  Daegu ,  Ulsan ,  Gyeongsang  region (South Korea)       Hamgyng   Rasn ,  Hamgyng  region,  Ryanggang  (North Korea)       Hwanghae   Hwanghae  region (North Korea)       Jeju   Jeju Island/Province  (South Korea)       Jeolla   Gwangju ,  Jeolla  region (South Korea)         [ edit ]   Phonology       This article contains  IPA  phonetic symbols.

Main article:  Korean phonology     [ edit ]   Consonants          The Korean consonants             Bilabial   Alveolar   Post-  alveolar   Velar   Glottal       Nasal      /m/      /n/        //  (syllable-final)         Plosive  and   Affricate   plain      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         tense      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         aspirated      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         Fricative   plain        /s/          /h/       tense        /s/             Liquid        /l/           The  IPA  symbol <  > (a subscript double straight quotation mark, shown here with a placeholder circle) is used to denote the tensed consonants  /p/, /t/, /k/, //, /s/ . Its official use in the  Extensions to the IPA  is for  'strong'  articulation, but is used in the literature for  faucalized voice . The Korean consonants also have elements of  stiff voice , but it is not yet known how typical this is of faucalized consonants. They are produced with a partially constricted  glottis  and additional subglottal pressure in addition to tense vocal tract walls, laryngeal lowering, or other expansion of the larynx.     [ edit ]   Vowels                    The Korean basic vowels                 Monophthongs   /i/    ,  /e/    ,  //    ,  /a/    ,  /o/    ,  /u/    ,  //    ,  //    ,  //          Vowels preceded by intermediaries,  or Diphthongs   /je/    ,  /j/    ,  /ja/    ,  /wi/    ,  /we/    ,  /w/    ,  /wa/    ,  /i/    ,  /jo/    ,  /ju/    ,  /j/    ,  /w/            [ edit ]   Allophones   /s/  becomes an  alveolo-palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i]  for most speakers (but see  Differences in the language between North Korea and South Korea ). This occurs with the tense fricative and all the affricates as well. At the end of a syllable, /s/ changes to /t/ (Example: beoseot () 'mushroom').   /h/  may become a  bilabial   []  before  [o]  or  [u] , a  palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i] , a  velar   [x]  before  [] , a voiced  []  between voiced sounds, and a  [h]  elsewhere. [ citation needed ]   /p, t, , k/  become voiced  [b, d, , ]  between voiced sounds.   /l/  becomes alveolar flap  []  between vowels, and  [l]  or  []  at the end of a syllable or next to another  /l/ . Note that a written syllable-final '', when followed by a vowel or a glide ( i.e. , when the next character starts with ''), migrates to the next syllable and thus becomes  [] .   Traditionally,  /l/  was disallowed at the beginning of a word. It disappeared before  [j] , and otherwise became  /n/ . However, the inflow of western loanword changed the trend, and now word-initial  /l/  (mostly from English loanwords) are pronounced as a free variation of either  []  or  [l] . The traditional prohibition of word-initial  /l/  became a morphological rule called ""initial law"" () in South Korea, which pertains to Sino-Korean vocabulary. Such words retain their word-initial  /l/  in North Korea.   All  obstruents  (plosives, affricates, fricatives) are  unreleased   [p, t, k]  at the end of a word.   Plosive stops  /p, t, k/  become nasal stops  [m, n, ]  before nasal stops.   Hangul  spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying, partly historical  morphology . Given this, it is sometimes hard to tell which actual phonemes are present in a certain word.   One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial  [r] , and initial  [n] . For example,     ""labour"" - north:  r odong  (), south:  n odong  ()   ""history"" - north:  ry ksa  (), south:  y eoksa  ()   ""female"" - north:  ny ja  (), south:  y eoja  ()       [ edit ]   Morphophonemics   Grammatical morphemes may change shape depending on the preceding sounds. Examples include  -eun/-neun  (-/-) and  -i/-ga  (-/-). Sometimes sounds may be inserted instead. Examples include  -eul/-reul  (-/-),  -euro/-ro  (-/-),  -eseo/-seo  (-/-),  -ideunji/-deunji  (-/-) and  -iya/-ya  (-/-). However,  -euro/-ro  is somewhat irregular, since it will behave differently after a rieul consonant.     Korean particles     After a consonant   After a rieul   After a vowel       -ui  (-)       -eun  (-)   -neun  (-)       -i  (-)   -ga  (-)       -eul  (-)   -reul  (-)       -gwa  (-)   -wa  (-)       -euro  (-)   -ro  (-)       Some verbs may also change shape morphophonemically.     [ edit ]   Grammar   Main article:  Korean grammar     [ edit ]   Sentence structure   Korean is an  agglutinative language . Modifiers generally follow the modified word, and in the case of verb modifiers, can be serially appended. The basic form of a Korean sentence is  Subject Object Verb , but the verb is the only required and immovable element.       A :       -       -? (?)           kage-e     kasseo-yo           store + [location marker ()]     [go (verb root) ()]+[conjunctive ()]+[past ()]+[conjunctive ()]+ [polite marker ()]         ""Did [you] go to the store?"" (with ""you"" implied by context)         B :       .           ne           yes         ""Yes.""       [ edit ]   Parts of speech     [ edit ]   Verb   Korean  verbs  (  ,  tongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""action verbs"" or ""dynamic verbs"" to distinguish them from [  () ,  hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""]), which are also known as ""descriptive verbs"" or ""stative verbs"". Examples of action/dynamic verbs include    ( hada , ""to do"") and    ( kada , ""to go"") which constitute an action or movement as opposed to descriptive verbs such as    ( yehppeuda , ""to be beautiful""). For a larger list of Korean verbs, see  wikt:Category:Korean verbs .   Unlike most of the European languages, Korean does not conjugate verbs using agreement with the subject, and nouns have no gender. Instead, verb conjugations depend upon the verb tense, aspect, mood, and the social relation between the speaker, the subjects, and the listeners. The system of speech levels and honorifics loosely resembles the  T-V distinction  of most  Indo-European languages . For example, different endings are used based on the speaker's relation with the person they are talking to or the person about which they are talking. Politeness is a critical part of Korean language and Korean culture, therefore, when talking to someone esteemed, the correct verb ending, which should have a lot of respect, must be chosen.     [ edit ]   Adjective   Words categorized as Korean  adjectives  (  ,  hyeong-yongsa ,   ) conjugate similarly to verbs, so some English texts call them ""descriptive verbs"" or "" stative verbs "", but they are distinctly separate from    ( tongsa ).   English does not have an identical grammatical category, so the English translation of Korean adjectives may misleadingly suggest that they are verbs. For example,    ( pukda ) translates literally as ""to be red"" and    ( aswipda ) often best translates as ""to lack"" or ""to want for"", but both are    ( hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""). For a larger list of Korean adjectives, see  wikt:Category:Korean adjectives .     [ edit ]   Determiner   Korean  determiners  (  ,  gwanhyeongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""determinatives"", ""adnominals"", ""pre-nouns"", ""attributives"", and ""unconjugated adjectives"". Examples include    ( kak , ""each""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean determiners .     [ edit ]   Noun   A large body of Korean  nouns  (  ,  myeongsa ,   ) stem from  Chinese characters , e.g.    (,  san , mountain),    (,  yeok , station),    (,  munhwa , culture), etc. Others are native to the Korean language, e.g.    ( nara , country),    ( nal , day). Many  Sino-Korean words  have a native Korean equivalent and vice versa, but not always. Nouns do not have  grammatical gender  and can be made  plural  by adding  to the end of the word, however in most instances the  singular  form is used even when in English it would be translated as plural. For example, while in English the sentence  ""there are three apples""  would use the plural  ""apples""  instead of the singular  ""apple"" , the Korean sentence    ( sagwa segae isssumnida ) maintains the word  ( sagwa , ""apple"") in its singular form, thus rendered in English as ""apple three(things) exist."" For a list of Korean nouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean nouns .     [ edit ]   Pronoun   Main article:  Korean pronouns   Korean  pronouns  (  ,  daemyeongsa ,   ) are highly influenced by the honorifics in the language. Pronouns change forms depending on the social status of the person or persons spoken to, e.g. the pronoun for ""I"" there is both the informal    ( na ) and the honorific/humble    ( jeo ). In general second person singular pronouns are avoided, especially when using honorific forms. For a larger list or Korean pronouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean pronouns .     [ edit ]   Adverb   Korean  adverbs  (  ,  busa ,   ) include    ( tto , ""also"") and    ( gadeuk , ""fully""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean adverbs .     [ edit ]   Particle   Korean  particles  (  ,  josa ,   ) are also known in English as "" postpositions "". Examples include    ( neun , topic marker) and    ( reul , object marker). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean particles .     [ edit ]   Interjection   Korean  interjections  (  ,  gamtansa ,   ) are also known in English as ""exclamations"". Examples include    ( ani , ""no""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean interjections .     [ edit ]   Number   Main article:  Korean numerals   Korean  numbers  or numerals (  ,  sutja ,   ) consitute two regularly used sets: a native Korean set and a  Sino-Korean  set. The Sino-Korean system is nearly entirely based on the  Chinese numerals . The distinction between the two numeral systems is very important. Everything that can be counted will use one of the two systems, but seldom both. Sino-Korean words are sometimes used to mark ordinal usage: yeol beon ( ) means ""ten times"" while sip beon (() ()) means ""number ten."" The grouping of large numbers in Korean follow the Chinese tradition of myriads (10000) rather than thousands (1000) as is common in Europe and North America.     [ edit ]   Speech levels and honorifics   Main article:  Korean honorifics   The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean, and the grammar reflects this. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject referent is reflected in  honorifics , while that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in  speech level .     [ edit ]   Honorifics   When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a younger stranger, student, employee or the like. Nowadays, there are special endings which can be used on declarative, interrogative, and imperative sentences; and both honorific or normal sentences. They are made for easier and faster use of Korean.     [ edit ]   Speech levels   There are seven verb  paradigms  or  speech levels  in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation. [ citation needed ]  Unlike  honorifics   which are used to show respect towards the referent   speech levels  are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience. The names of the 7 levels are derived from the non-honorific  imperative  form of the verb    ( hada , ""do"") in each level, plus the suffix  ('che',  hanja :   ), which means ""style.""   The highest 6 levels are generally grouped together as  jondaenmal  (), while the lowest level ( haeche , ) is called  banmal  () in Korean.     [ edit ]   Vocabulary   The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words. Like Japanese and Vietnamese, more than 50% of the vocabulary (up to 60% by some estimates), especially words that denote abstract ideas, are  Sino-Korean words , [ 7 ]  either     directly borrowed from  Written Chinese , or   coined in Japan or Korea using  Chinese characters ,     in a similar way European languages borrow from Latin and Greek. Korean has two  number systems : one native, and one borrowed from Chinese.   To a much lesser extent, words have also occasionally been borrowed from  Mongolian ,  Sanskrit , and other languages. Conversely, the Korean language itself has also contributed some loanwords to other languages, most notably the  Tsushima dialect  of Japanese.   The vast majority of loanwords other than Sino-Korean come from modern times, 90% of which are from  English . [ 8 ]  Many words have also been borrowed from  Japanese  and  Western languages  such as  German  ( areubaiteu  part-time job,  allereugi  allergy). Some Western words were borrowed indirectly via Japanese, taking a Japanese sound pattern, for example dozen >     dsu  >     daseu . Most indirect Western borrowings are now written according to current Hangulization rules for the respective Western language, as if borrowed directly. There are a few more complicated borrowings such as German(y) (see  Names for Germany ), the first part of whose  endonym   [d.lant]  the Japanese approximated using the  kanji      doitsu  that were then accepted into the Korean language by their Sino-Korean pronunciation:     dok  +     il  =  Dogil . In South Korean official use, a number of other Sino-Korean country names have been replaced with phonetically oriented Hangulizations of the countries' endonyms or English names.   North Korean vocabulary shows a tendency to prefer native Korean over Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings, especially with recent political objectives aimed at eliminating foreign (mostly Chinese) influences on the Korean language in the North. By contrast, South Korean may have several Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings which tend to be absent in North Korean.

Such systems were not popular because hanja is not well suited to the Korean language. Its use is now limited.   Korean is now mainly written in Hangul, the Korean alphabet promulgated in 1446 by  Sejong the Great ;  hanja may be mixed in  to write  Sino-Korean words . South Korea still teaches 1800 hanja characters in its schools, while the North abolished the use of hanja decades ago.

Korean  punctuation  marks are almost identical to Western ones. Traditionally, Korean was written in columns from top to bottom, right to left, but is now usually written in rows from left to right, top to bottom.     [ edit ]   Differences between North Korean and South Korean   Main article:  Korean language North-South differences   The Korean language used in the North and the South exhibits differences in pronunciation, spelling, grammar and vocabulary. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Pronunciation   In North Korea,  palatalization  of  /si/  is optional, and  //  can be pronounced as  [z]  in between vowels.   Words that are written the same way may be pronounced differently, such as the examples below. The pronunciations below are given in  Revised Romanization ,  McCune-Reischauer  and Hangul, the last of which represents what the Hangul would be if one writes the word as pronounced.

(In the South, this rule only applies when it is attached to any single-character Sino-Korean word.)     [ edit ]   Spelling   Some words are spelled differently by the North and the South, but the pronunciations are the same.

[ edit ]   Spelling and pronunciation   Some words have different spellings and pronunciations in the North and the South, some of which were given in the ""Phonology"" section above:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          ryeongryang (ryngryang)      yeongnyang (yngnyang)   strength   Korean words originally starting in  r  or  n  have their  r  or  n  dropped in the South Korean version if the sound following it is an  i  or  y  sound.          rodong (rodong)      nodong (nodong)   work   Korean words originally starting in  r  have their  r  changed to  n  in the South Korean version if the sound following it is a sound other than  i  or  y .          wonssu (wnssu)      wonsu (wnsu)   mortal enemy   ""Mortal enemy"" and ""head of state"" are homophones in the South. Possibly to avoid referring to  Kim Il-sung  /  Kim Jong-il  as the enemy, the second syllable of ""enemy"" is written and pronounced  in the North.          rajio (rajio)      radio (radio)   radio            u (u)      wi (wi)   on; above            anhae (anhae)      anae (anae)   wife            kkuba (kkuba)      kuba (k'uba)   Cuba   When transcribing foreign words from languages that do not have contrasts between aspirated and unaspirated stops, North Koreans generally use tensed stops for the unaspirated ones while South Koreans use aspirated stops in both cases.          pe (p'e)      pye (p'ye), pe (p'e)   lungs   All hanja pronounced as  pye  ( p'ye ) or  pe  ( p'e ) in the South are pronounced as  pe  ( p'e ) in the North. The spelling is also accordingly different.       In general, when transcribing place names, North Korea tends to use the pronunciation in the original language more than South Korea, which often uses the pronunciation in English. For example:       Original name   North Korea transliteration   English name   South Korea transliteration       Spelling   Pronunciation   Spelling   Pronunciaton       Ulaanbaatar      ullanbattareu (ullanbattar)   Ulan Bator      ullanbatoreu (ullanbat'or)       Kbenhavn      koeppenhabeun (k'oeppenhabn)   Copenhagen      kopenhagen (k'op'enhagen)       al-Qhirah      kkahira (kkahira)   Cairo      kairo (k'airo)         [ edit ]   Grammar   Some grammatical constructions are also different:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          doeyeotda (toeytta)      doeeotda (toetta)   past tense of  (doeda/toeda), ""to become""   All similar grammar forms of verbs or adjectives that end in  in the stem (i.e. , , , ,  and ) in the North use  instead of the South's .          gomawayo (komawayo)      gomawoyo (komawyo)   thanks   -irregular verbs in the North use  (wa) for all those with a positive ending vowel; this only happens in the South if the verb stem has only one syllable.          halgayo (halkayo)      halkkayo (halkkayo)   Shall we do?   Although the Hangul differ, the pronunciations are the same (i.e. with the tensed  sound).         [ edit ]   Vocabulary   Some vocabulary is different between the North and the South:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          munhwajutaek (munhwajut'aek)      apateu (ap'at')   Apartment     (appateu/appat') is also used in the North.          joseonmal (chosnmal)      han-gugeo(han'gugeo)   Korean language            gwakbap (kwakpap)      dosirak (tosirak)   lunch box           [ edit ]   Others   In the North,  guillemets     and    are the symbols used for quotes; in the South, quotation marks equivalent to the English ones,  and , are standard, although     and     are sometimes used in popular novels.     [ edit ]   Study by non-native speakers   The  United States '  Defense Language Institute  classifies Korean alongside  Arabic ,  Chinese , and  Japanese  as a Category IV language, meaning that 63 weeks of instruction (as compared to just 25 weeks for  French ,  Spanish ,  Portuguese , and  Italian ) are required to bring an English-speaking student to a limited working level of proficiency in which he or she has ""sufficient capability to meet routine social demands and limited job requirements"" and ""can deal with concrete topics in past, present, and future tense."" [ 10 ]  As a result, the study of the Korean language in the United States is dominated by  Korean American  heritage language students; they are estimated to form over 80% of all students of the language at non-military universities. [ 11 ]   However, Korean is considerably easier for speakers of certain other languages, such as Japanese, Mongolian and Turkic languages; in Japan, it is more widely studied by non-heritage learners. [ 12 ]  The  Korean Language Proficiency Test , an examination aimed at assessing non-native speakers' competence in Korean, was instituted in 1997; 17,000 people applied for the 2005 sitting of the examination.

clueweb09-en0007-20-28205	"  Main Page  |  See live article  |  Alphabetical index               Korean language The  Korean language  is spoken primarily and officially in  Korea  ( South Korea  and  North Korea ), also in the  People's Republic of China  ( Yanbian ). Worldwide, there are around 78 million Korean speakers, including large groups in the former  Soviet Union , the  United States ,  Canada , and  Japan . Korean is considered by many to be a member of the  Altaic family , but its proper  classification  is not universally agreed on.  The native Korean writing system, the  Hangul  is alphabetic and phonetic.  Along with  Sino-Korean  characters ( Hanja ), well over 50% of the Korean vocabulary comes directly or indirectly from from  Chinese .

The Korean names for Korean are:   in North Korea are:    Chosŏnŏ  (in  McCune-Reischauer  romanization, as used in North Korea; 조선어) or     Chosŏnmal  (조선말)   in South Korea are:    Hangugeo  (in  Revised Romanization of Korea , as used in Soth Korea; 한국어) or     Hangungmal  (한국말).  History   Classification and related languages  Korean is often classified as being a separate language in a family of its own (a  language isolate ). In addition, most Korean and some Western linguists recognize Korean's kinship to the  Altaic languages . On the other hand, traditional Western (since the 18th century) and many Japanese linguists believe that Korea has genetic relationship with  Japanese .  In Korea, the possibility of Korean-Japanese linguistic relationship has been ignored mostly. However, the Korean relationship with  Altaic  and proto-Altaic also have been much argued as of late.  It does have some semblances considering the  morphology to some languages of the Eastern Turkic group, namely,  Yakutsk and some of its variants, and some linguistics believe that Altaic itself forms part of a larger Ural-Altaic language family.  Korean's seemingly similarities, especially vocabulary and certain prounciations, to Chinese (of the  Sino-Tibetan family ) is superificial and not genetic. They occurred because of close and frequent contacts during the time of recorded history.   Geographic distribution   Dialects  Korean has several  dialects  (called  mal ,  bangeon , or  saturi  in Korean).  The  standard language  ( Pyojuneo  or  Pyojunmal ) of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  Pyeongyang .  These dialects are similar, and in fact all dialects except that of Jeju (Cheju) Island are largely mutually intelligible. The dialect spoken there is classified as a different language by some Korean linguists.  One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of  Seoul  Dialect use stress very little, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of  Gyeongsang  Dialect have a very pronounced intonation that makes their dialect sound more like a European language to western ears.  Although the naming and grouping of dialects is always changing as the study of dialects develops, here is a list of traditional dialect names and locations:     Dialect Where Used   Seoulmal Seoul ,  Incheon , Gaeseong Cities,  Gyeonggi ,  Gangweon , North/South  Hwanghae  Provinces   Pyeonganmal Pyeongyang, Nampo Cities, North/South Pyeongan, Jagang Provinces   Chungcheongmal Daejeon  City, North/South  Chungcheong  Provinces   Jeollamal Gwangju  City, North/South  Jeolla  Provinces   Gyeongsangmal Busan ,  Daegu ,  Ulsan  Cities, North/South  Gyeongsang  Provinces   Jejumal Jeju  Island/Province   Hamgyeongmal Cheongjin, Najin-Seonbong Cities, North/South Hamgyeong,  Yanggang  Provinces       Sounds   Consonants                           Bilabial      Alveolar      Palatal      Velar      Glottal             Stop      plain      p      t      c      k                   tensed      p’      t’      c’      k’                   aspirated      p h      t h      c h      k h                    Fricative      plain             s                    h            tensed             s’                                  Nasal      m      n             ŋ                    Lateral approximant             l                            Example words for consonants:        phoneme    IPA    Romanized    English        p    pal    bal    'foot'        p’    p’al    ppal    'sucking'         p h    p h al    pal    'arm'        m    mal    mal    'horse'        t    tal    dal    'moon'        t’    t’al    ttal    'daughter'         t h    t h al    tal    'riding'        n    nal    nal    'day'        c    cal    jal    'well'        c’    c’al    jjal    'squeezing'         c h    c h al    chal    'kicking'        k    kal    gal    'goin'        k’    k’al    kkal    'spreading'         k h    k h al    kal    'knife'        ŋ    baŋ    bang    'room'        s    sal    sal    'flesh'        s’    s’al    ssal    'rice'         l    balam    baram    'wind'        h    hal    hal    'doing'      [c], [cʰ], and [c'] have more frication than the other stops and are sometimes described as affricates.   The symbol [’] is used to denote the tensed consonants ([p’], [t’], [c’], [k’], and [s’]) but its official  IPA  usage is for ejective consonants, which the tensed stops in Korean are not. The tensed stops are produced with a partially constricted  glottis  and additional subglottal pressure.  [s] becomes [ʃ] or [ɕ] before [j] or [i].  [h] becomes [ɸ] before [u] and [ç] before [i] or [j]  [p], [t], [c], and [k] become voiced [b], [d], [ɟ], and [ɡ] between sonorant segments.  Vowels     Monophthongs  Korean has 8 different vowel qualities and a length distinction. The close-mid front rounded vowel [ø] can still be heard in the speech of some older speakers, but it has largely been replaced by the diphthong [we]. Similarly, the length distinction for all vowels can still be heard from older speakers, but it is no longer made by most younger speakers.          i    siˈɟaŋ    zijang    'hunger'    iː    ˈsiːɟaŋ    zijang    'market'        e    beˈɡɛ    begae    'pillow'    eː    ˈbeːda    beda    'to cut'        ɛ    tʰɛˈjaŋ    taeyang    'sun'    ɛː    ˈtʰɛːdo    taedo    'attitude'        a    ˈmal    mal    'horse'    aː    ˈmaːl    mal    'speech'        o    poˈli    bori    'barley'    oː    ˈpoːsu    bozu    'salary'        u    kuˈli    guri    'bronze'    uː    ˈsuːbak    zubak    'bronze'        ʌ    ˈpʌl    beol    'punishment'    ʌː    ˈpʌːl    beol    'bee'        ɯ    ˈʌːlɯn    eoreun    'seniors'    ɯː    ˈɯːmzik    eumzik    'food'     Diphthongs and glides  [j] and [w] are considered to be components of diphthongs rather than separate consonant phonemes.                      wi dwi dwi 'back'        ɯi' ˈɯisa uiza 'doctor'     je ˈjeːs’aŋ yessang 'budget'        we kwe gwe 'box'                    jɛ ˈjɛːki yaegi 'story'        wɛ wɛ wae 'why'                    ja ˈjaːgu yagu 'baseball'        wa kwaːˈil kwa-il 'fruits'                    jo ˈkjoːs’a gyosa 'teacher'                                   ju juˈli yuri 'glass'                                   jʌ jʌːgi yeogi 'here'        wʌ mwʌ mwo 'what'                   Source:  Handbook of the International Phonetic Association   Phonology  Phonetic rules, mostly assimilation, transform the pronunciation of some words.

For example,   p -> b   t -> d   k -> g   Stops are nasalized before a nasal. For example,   p -> m (before m, n, or ng)   t -> n (before m, n, or ng)   k -> ng (before m, n, or ng)   Hangeul  spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying  morphology.   Grammar  Korean is an  agglutinative language . Korean grammar is similar to that of the Japanese language. The basic form of a Korean sentence is Subject-Object-Verb ( SOV ), and modifiers precede the modified word. Accordingly, whereas in English, one would say, ""I'm going to the store to buy some food"", in Korean it would be: *""I food to-buy in-order-to store-to going-am.""  In Korean, ""unnecessary"" words (see theme and rheme) can be left out of a sentence as long as the context makes the meaning clear. A typical exchange might translate word-for word to the following:   H: ""가게에 가세요?""  G: ""예.""   H: *""store-to going-are?""  G: ""yes.""   which in English would translate to:  H: ""Are you going to the store?""  G: ""Yes.""   Unlike Romance languages, Korean does not conjugate verbs using agreement with the subject, and nouns have no gender. Instead, verb conjugations depend upon the verb tense and on the relation between the people speaking. When talking to or about friends, you would use one conjugate ending, to your parents, another, and to nobility/honored persons, another. This loosely echoes the  T-V distinction  of  Spanish  and  German .   Speech Levels and Honorifics  The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean, and the grammar reflects this.  The relationship between speaker/writer and subject is reflected in  honorifics , while that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in  speech level .   Honorifics  When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer to use special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority.  Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older distant relative (grandparent's sibling, older sibling's spouse, etc.), a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like.  Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a close relative (grandparent, parent, spouse, or sibling), younger stranger, student, employee, or the like.  On rare occasions (like when someone wants to pick a fight), a speaker might speak to a superior or stranger in a way normally only used for, say, animals, but no one would do this without seriously considering the consequences to their physical safety first!  One way of using honorifics is to use  special nouns  in place of regular nouns with ""honorific"" ones.  A common example is using  jinji  instead of  bap  for ""food.""  More often, special nouns are used when speaking about relatives.  Thus, the speaker/writer may address his own grandmother as  halmeoni  but refer to someone else's grandmother as  halmeonim .  (The  m  comes from the honorific suffix  -nim  (님), which is affixed to many kinship terms to make them honorific; thus,  hyeong  (older sibling of the same sex) becomes  hyeongnim .)  All verbs can be converted into an honorific form by adding the infix  -shi-  (시) after the  stem  and before the verb ending.  Thus,  gada  (""go"") becomes  gashida .  A few verbs have special honorific equivalents.  So  gyeshida  is the honorific form of  itda  (""exist"");  japsushida  is the honorific form of  meokda  (""eat""); and  jumushida  is the honorific form of  jada  (""sleep"").  A few verbs have special humble forms, used when the speaker is referring to him/herself in polite situations.  These include  deurida  and  ollida  for  juda  (""give"").   Deurida  is substituted for  juda  when the latter is used as an auxiliary verb, while  ollida --which literally means ""raise up""--is used for  juda  in the sense of ""offer.""  Derived from  ollida  is the noun  ollim , which is the humble form of  seonmul  (""gift"").  Pronouns in Korean have their own set of polite equivalents: thus,  jeo  is the humble form of  na  (""I"");  jeoheui  is the humble form of  uri  (""we""); and  dangshin  (""friend,"" but only used as a form of address and more polite than ""chingu,"" the usual word for ""friend) is the honorific form of  neo  (""you"" (singular)).   Speech Levels  There are no fewer than 7 verb  paradigms  or  speech levels  in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation.  Unlike  honorifics --which are used to show respect towards a subject-- speech levels  are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience.  The names of the 7 levels are derived from the non-honorific  imperative  form of the verb  hada  (""do"") in each level, plus the suffix che, which means ""body.""  The highest 5 levels use final verb endings, while the lowest 2 levels ( haeyoche ) and ( haeche ) use non-final endings and are called  banmal  (""half-words"") in Korean.  (The  haeyoche  in turn is formed by simply adding the non-final ending  yo  (요) to the  haeche  form of the verb.)  Taken together, honorifics and speech levels form a  cartesian product  of 14 basic verb stems.  Here is a table giving the 7 levels, the  present  indicative form of the verb  hada  (하다; ""do"" in English) in each level in both its honorific and non-honorific forms, and the situations in which each level is used.     Speech Level Non-Honorific Present Indicative of ""hada"" Honorific Present Indicative of ""hada"" Level of Formality When Used   Hasoseoche (하소서체) hanaida (하나이다) hashinaida (하시나이다) Extremely formal and polite Traditionally used when addressing a king, queen, or high official; now only used in historical dramas and the Bible   Hapshoche (합쇼체) hamnida (합니다) hashimnida (하십니다) Formal and polite Used commonly between strangers, among male co-workers, by TV announcers, and to customers   Haoche (하오체) hao (하오) hasho (하쇼), hashio (하시오) Formal, of neutral politeness Only used nowadays among some older people;  Samuel E. Martin 's 1954 book  Korean in a Hurry  states that it was the form used by police officers when giving out traffic tickets!   Hageche (하게체) hane (하네) hashine (하시네) Informal, of neutral politeness Generally only used by some older people when addressing younger people, friends, or relatives   Haerache (해라체) handa (한다) hashinda (하신다) Formal, of neutral politeness Used to close friends, relatives of similar age, or younger people; also used almost universally in books, newspapapers, and magazines; also used in reported speech (""She said that..."")   Haeyoche (해요체) haeyo (해요) haseyo (하세요) (common), hasheoyo (하셔요) (rare) Informal and polite Used mainly between strangers, especially those older or of equal age.  Traditionally used more by women than men, though in  Seoul  many men prefer this form to the Hapshoche (see above).   Haeche (해체) hae (해) (in speech), hayeo (하여) (in writing) hasheo(하셔) Informal, of neutral politeness or impolite Used most often between close friends and relatives, and when addressing younger people.  It is  never  used between strangers unless the speaker wants to pick a fight.     Vocabulary  The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words.  Roughly 70% of the vocabulary, however, is made up of  Sino-Korean  words, which are derived from  Chinese characters .  Many of these words were borrowed from  Chinese , although many modern-day scientific terms come from  Japanese .  To a much lesser extent, words have also been borrowed from  Mongolian ,  Sanskrit , and other languages.  In modern times, many words have also been borrowed from Western languages such as  German  and, more recently,  English .     Writing system   Main article:  Hangul  The Korean language was originally written using "" Hanja "", or  Chinese characters ; it is now mainly written in  Hangul , the Korean alphabet, optionally mixing in Hanja to write  Sino-Korean  words. Hangeul consists of 24 letters -- 14 consonants and 10 vowels that are written in blocks of 2 to 5 characters.  Unlike the  Chinese  writing system and the  Japanese   Kanji  system, Hangul is not an  ideographic  system.  The shapes of the individual Hangul letters were designed to model the physical morphology of the tongue, palate and teeth; up to five letters join to form a syllabic unit.  Below is a chart of the Korean alphabet's symbols and their canonical  SAMPA  values:                                       Consonants     p   t    c   k        ᄇ   ᄃ   ᄌ   ᄀ        p’   t’   c’   k’        ᄈ   ᄄ   ᄍ   ᄁ        p h   t h   c h   k h        ᄑ   ᄐ   ᄎ   ᄏ            s       h            ᄉ       ᄒ            s’                    ᄊ                m   n       N        ᄆ   ᄂ       ᄋ        w   r   j            (n/a)   ᄅ   (n/a)                           Vowels     i   e   }   a   o   u   7   M         ᅵ   ᅦ   ᅢ   ᅡ   ᅩ   ᅮ   ᅥ   ᅳ         Mi   je   j}   ja   jo   ju   j7             ᅴ   ᅨ   ᅤ   ᅣ   ᅭ   ᅲ   ᅧ             ui   ue   o}   oa           u7             ᅱ   ᅰ   ᅫ   ᅪ           ᅯ               (See also:  Hangul consonant tables )  Modern Korean is written with  spacess  between  words , a feature not found in the other  CJK  languages (Chinese and Japanese).  Korean  punctuation  marks are almost identical to Western ones.  Traditionally, Korean was written in columns from top to bottom, right to left, much as in other East Asian cultures.  Korean is often still written in columns (especially in newspapers and poetry), but is now more usually now written in rows from left to right, top to bottom.

Korean is also used by democratic state governments and companies, outside Korea, as a secondary language to assist in public service and to provide corporate customer services. All in all, the language is used by more than 75 million people in the world.   The Korean language is a member of a wider linguistic family of the Altaic languages. The Korean writing system, Hangeul, was invented in 1446 by King Sejong to widely spread education as the Chinese characters was thought to be difficult for a common person to learn through the proclamation of Hoonminjungeum [훈민정음/訓民正音)] which literally means the ""proper sounds to teach the general public."" It is different from the Chinese form of written communication as it is phonetically based.   Numerous underlying words still stem from Hanja and older people in Korea still prefer to write words in Hanja, as they were strictly forbidden to study and speak the Korean language when Japan ruled. Koreans are the only people in the world who fully understand how, when and why their written language was created through the transcripts of King Sejong's innovative contributions.

Classification     Korean, as such, is often classified as being a separate language in a family of its own. Its former link to  Altaic  and proto-Altaic also have been much argued as of late. It does have some semblances considering the  morphology  to some languages of the Eastern Turkic group, namely,  Yakutsk[?]  and some of its variants.   Though some may think that the Korean language is clearly different to  Japanese , this is due to the Japanese using non-Chinese readings to some  Chinese characters . For instance, the city of ""Hitachi"" (日立) is pronounced ""Il-Lip"" in Korean. This is a case where the Japanese word ""Tachi"" (meaning ""standing"") is used instead of Chinese-based ""Ritsu"". In other words, there are irregularities for pronouncing  Hanja  (or "" Kanji "") in the Japanese language, due to Japanese using and adapting the Chinese script to the Japanese language. Korean knows no such diviation, due to adoption of the Korean alphabet  Hangul .   It should be noted, however, that it were the  Koreans  of  Baekjae[?]  that taught and spread Chinese characters to the  Japanese  during the 7th century which gives explaination for gramatical similarities.

The  standard language[?]  of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  Pyongyang . These dialects are similar, and in fact all dialects except that of Jeju (Cheju) Island are largely mutually intelligible. The dialect spoken there is classified as a different language by many Korean linguists. Jeju Dialect has a structure similar to Japanese, so it is suspected as evidence of a relationship between Korean and Japanese.                            Send this page                                                     Link to this page:  The easy way to educate your website visitors.

In South Korea, the language is most often called  Hangungmal  (  ;   ), or more formally,  Hangugeo  (  ;   ) or  Gugeo  (  ;   ; literally ""national language"").   In North Korea and Yanbian in China, the language is most often called  Chosnmal  (  ; with  hanja :   ), or more formally,  Chosn  (  ;   ).   On the other hand, Korean people in the  former USSR , who refer to themselves as  Koryo-saram  (also  Goryeoin  [  ;   ; literally, "" Goryeo  person(s)""]) call the language  Goryeomal  (  ;   ).   In  mainland China , following the establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992, the term  Choxiny  (   or short form:  Choy  (  )) has normally been used to refer to the language spoken in North Korea and Yanbian, while  Hnguy  (   or short form:  Hny  (  )) is used to refer to the language spoken in South Korea.   Some older English sources also used the name ""Korean"" to refer to the language, country, and people.     [ edit ]   History   Main article:  History of the Korean language   Korean is descended from  Old Korean  and  Middle Korean .     [ edit ]   Classification   The classification of the modern Korean language is uncertain, and due to the lack of any one generally accepted theory, it is sometimes described conservatively as a  language isolate .   On the other hand, since the publication of the article of  Ramstedt  in 1926, many linguists support the hypothesis that Korean can be classified as an  Altaic  language, or as a relative of proto-Altaic. Korean is similar to Altaic languages in that they both lack certain grammatical elements, including  number ,  gender ,  articles , fusional morphology, voice, and  relative pronouns  (Kim Namkil). Korean especially bears some  morphological  resemblance to some languages of the Northern Turkic group, namely  Sakha (Yakut) . Vinokurova, a scholar of the Sakha language, noted that like in Korean, and unlike in other  Turkic languages  or a variety of other languages surveyed, adverbs in Sakha are derived from verbs with the help of derivational morphology; however, she did not suggest this implied any relation between the two languages. [ 2 ]   It is also considered likely that Korean is related in some way to  Japanese , since the two languages have nearly identical grammatical structures, and share a number of possible phonological cognates (though a majority of them are likely due to local pronunciations of the Chinese characters from which they are derived), as noted by such researchers as  Samuel E. Martin  and  Roy Andrew Miller  in the late 1960s.  Sergei Starostin  (1991) found about 25% of potential cognates in the Japanese-Korean 100-word  Swadesh list , which places these two languages closer together than other possible members of the Altaic family. [ 3 ]   Genetic relationships have been postulated both directly and indirectly, the latter either through placing both languages in the Altaic family, or by arguing for a relationship between Japanese and the  Buyeo languages  of  Goguryeo  and  Baekje  (see below); the proposed Baekje relationship is supported by cognates such as Baekje  mir , Japanese  mi-  ""three"". [ 4 ]   The possible relationship between Korean and Japanese can be exemplified by such basic vocabularly items as J.     mizu  (Old J.  midu ) : K.     mul  (Middle K.  mirh ) ""water"",  mot  ""lake""; J.     ku-ru  ""come"" (Old J.  ku , also cf. irregular root changes as in past tense   ki-ta , negative   ko-nai  in Modern J.) : K.     ka-da  (""go""); J.     kata-i  ""hard"" (whence     kata-na  ""knife, sword"") : K.  kud-yn  (hard); J.     i-ru  ""to be"" (past tense   i-ta ) : K.     i-da  ""to be""; J.  na ,  -en  : K.  anh  ""not"", J.  minna  (Old J.  mynna ) ""all, everyone"" : K.  manh-  ""many"" (predicate  mana-da ), etc.  [ 5 ] . The same possible cognates are often observed in other members of the potential  Altaic family , esp. in the  Tungusic languages . Cf. Nanay  mue  ""water"",  giagda-  ""to walk"",  anaa, anna  ""not"".   Others argue, however, that the similarities are not due to any genetic relationship, but rather to a  sprachbund  effect. [ citation needed ]  See  East Asian languages  for morphological features shared among languages of the East Asian  sprachbund , and  Classification of Japanese  for further details on the possible relationship. Though it is very difficult to believe words such as ""water"", ""to be"", and ""to go"" arise from sprachbund effects.   It is presumed that modern Korean may be more closely related to the languages of  Samhan  and  Silla  than the Buyeo languages; many Korean scholars believe they were mutually intelligible, and the collective basis of what in the  Goryeo  period would merge to become Middle Korean (the language before the changes that the  Seven-Year War  brought) and eventually Modern Korean. The  Jeju dialect  preserves some archaic features that can also be found in Middle Korean, whose  arae a  is retained in the dialect as a distinct vowel.   There are also more marginal hypotheses proposing various other relationships; for example, a few scholars, such as  Homer B. Hulbert  (1905), have tried to relate Korean to the  Dravidian languages  through the similar syntax in both. [ 6 ]   Though not related to Chinese, it has borrowed heavily; see the Vocabulary section below.     [ edit ]   Dialects   Main article:  Korean dialects          Dialects of Korean       Korean has several  dialects  (called  mal  [literally ""speech""],  saturi , or  bang-eon  in Korean). The  standard language  ( pyojuneo  or  pyojunmal ) of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  P'yngyang . All dialects of Korean are similar to each other, and are in fact all mutually intelligible, perhaps with the exception of the dialect of  Jeju Island  (see  Jeju dialect ). The dialect spoken in Jeju is in fact classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of  Seoul dialect  use very little stress, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of the  Gyeongsang dialect  have a very pronounced intonation.   It is also worth noting that there is substantial evidence for a history of extensive  dialect levelling , or even  convergent evolution  or intermixture of two or more originally distinct linguistic stocks, within the Korean language and its dialects. Many Korean dialects have basic vocabulary that is etymologically distinct from vocabulary of identical meaning in Standard Korean or other dialects, such as South Jeolla dialect /kur/ vs. Standard Korean     /ip/  ""mouth"" or Gyeongsang dialect  /.u.i/  vs. Standard Korean  /puu/  "" garlic chives ."" This suggests that the Korean Peninsula may have at one time been much more linguistically diverse than it is at present. See also the  Buyeo languages   hypothesis .   There is a very close connection between the dialects of Korean and the  regions of Korea , since the boundaries of both are largely determined by mountains and seas. Here is a list of traditional dialect names and locations:       Standard dialect   Where used       Seoul   Seoul  (),  Incheon  (/), most of  Gyeonggi  (/)       P'yngan  (/)   P'yngyang ,  P'yngan  region,  Chagang  (North Korea)       Regional dialect   Where used       Gyeonggi   limited areas of the  Gyeonggi  region (South Korea)       Chungcheong   Daejeon ,  Chungcheong  region (South Korea)       Gangwon   Gangwon-do (South Korea) / Kangwn (North Korea)       Gyeongsang   Busan ,  Daegu ,  Ulsan ,  Gyeongsang  region (South Korea)       Hamgyng   Rasn ,  Hamgyng  region,  Ryanggang  (North Korea)       Hwanghae   Hwanghae  region (North Korea)       Jeju   Jeju Island/Province  (South Korea)       Jeolla   Gwangju ,  Jeolla  region (South Korea)         [ edit ]   Phonology       This article contains  IPA  phonetic symbols.

Main article:  Korean phonology     [ edit ]   Consonants          The Korean consonants             Bilabial   Alveolar   Post-  alveolar   Velar   Glottal       Nasal      /m/      /n/        //  (syllable-final)         Plosive  and   Affricate   plain      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         tense      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         aspirated      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         Fricative   plain        /s/          /h/       tense        /s/             Liquid        /l/           The  IPA  symbol <  > (a subscript double straight quotation mark, shown here with a placeholder circle) is used to denote the tensed consonants  /p/, /t/, /k/, //, /s/ . Its official use in the  Extensions to the IPA  is for  'strong'  articulation, but is used in the literature for  faucalized voice . The Korean consonants also have elements of  stiff voice , but it is not yet known how typical this is of faucalized consonants. They are produced with a partially constricted  glottis  and additional subglottal pressure in addition to tense vocal tract walls, laryngeal lowering, or other expansion of the larynx.     [ edit ]   Vowels                    The Korean basic vowels                 Monophthongs   /i/    ,  /e/    ,  //    ,  /a/    ,  /o/    ,  /u/    ,  //    ,  //    ,  //          Vowels preceded by intermediaries,  or Diphthongs   /je/    ,  /j/    ,  /ja/    ,  /wi/    ,  /we/    ,  /w/    ,  /wa/    ,  /i/    ,  /jo/    ,  /ju/    ,  /j/    ,  /w/            [ edit ]   Allophones   /s/  becomes an  alveolo-palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i]  for most speakers (but see  Differences in the language between North Korea and South Korea ). This occurs with the tense fricative and all the affricates as well. At the end of a syllable, /s/ changes to /t/ (Example: beoseot () 'mushroom').   /h/  may become a  bilabial   []  before  [o]  or  [u] , a  palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i] , a  velar   [x]  before  [] , a voiced  []  between voiced sounds, and a  [h]  elsewhere. [ citation needed ]   /p, t, , k/  become voiced  [b, d, , ]  between voiced sounds.   /l/  becomes alveolar flap  []  between vowels, and  [l]  or  []  at the end of a syllable or next to another  /l/ . Note that a written syllable-final '', when followed by a vowel or a glide ( i.e. , when the next character starts with ''), migrates to the next syllable and thus becomes  [] .   Traditionally,  /l/  was disallowed at the beginning of a word. It disappeared before  [j] , and otherwise became  /n/ . However, the inflow of western loanword changed the trend, and now word-initial  /l/  (mostly from English loanwords) are pronounced as a free variation of either  []  or  [l] . The traditional prohibition of word-initial  /l/  became a morphological rule called ""initial law"" () in South Korea, which pertains to Sino-Korean vocabulary. Such words retain their word-initial  /l/  in North Korea.   All  obstruents  (plosives, affricates, fricatives) are  unreleased   [p, t, k]  at the end of a word.   Plosive stops  /p, t, k/  become nasal stops  [m, n, ]  before nasal stops.   Hangul  spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying, partly historical  morphology . Given this, it is sometimes hard to tell which actual phonemes are present in a certain word.   One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial  [r] , and initial  [n] . For example,     ""labour"" - north:  r odong  (), south:  n odong  ()   ""history"" - north:  ry ksa  (), south:  y eoksa  ()   ""female"" - north:  ny ja  (), south:  y eoja  ()       [ edit ]   Morphophonemics   Grammatical morphemes may change shape depending on the preceding sounds. Examples include  -eun/-neun  (-/-) and  -i/-ga  (-/-). Sometimes sounds may be inserted instead. Examples include  -eul/-reul  (-/-),  -euro/-ro  (-/-),  -eseo/-seo  (-/-),  -ideunji/-deunji  (-/-) and  -iya/-ya  (-/-). However,  -euro/-ro  is somewhat irregular, since it will behave differently after a rieul consonant.     Korean particles     After a consonant   After a rieul   After a vowel       -ui  (-)       -eun  (-)   -neun  (-)       -i  (-)   -ga  (-)       -eul  (-)   -reul  (-)       -gwa  (-)   -wa  (-)       -euro  (-)   -ro  (-)       Some verbs may also change shape morphophonemically.     [ edit ]   Grammar   Main article:  Korean grammar     [ edit ]   Sentence structure   Korean is an  agglutinative language . Modifiers generally follow the modified word, and in the case of verb modifiers, can be serially appended. The basic form of a Korean sentence is  Subject Object Verb , but the verb is the only required and immovable element.       A :       -       -? (?)           kage-e     kasseo-yo           store + [location marker ()]     [go (verb root) ()]+[conjunctive ()]+[past ()]+[conjunctive ()]+ [polite marker ()]         ""Did [you] go to the store?"" (with ""you"" implied by context)         B :       .           ye           yes         ""Yes.""       [ edit ]   Parts of speech     [ edit ]   Verb   Korean  verbs  (  ,  tongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""action verbs"" or ""dynamic verbs"" to distinguish them from [  () ,  hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""]), which are also known as ""descriptive verbs"" or ""stative verbs"". Examples of action/dynamic verbs include    ( hada , ""to do"") and    ( kada , ""to go"") which constitute an action or movement as opposed to descriptive verbs such as    ( yehppeuda , ""to be beautiful""). For a larger list of Korean verbs, see  wikt:Category:Korean verbs .   Unlike most of the European languages, Korean does not conjugate verbs using agreement with the subject, and nouns have no gender. Instead, verb conjugations depend upon the verb tense, aspect, mood, and the social relation between the speaker, the subjects, and the listeners. The system of speech levels and honorifics loosely resembles the  T-V distinction  of most  Indo-European languages . For example, different endings are used based on the speaker's relation with the person they are talking to or the person about which they are talking. Politeness is a critical part of Korean language and Korean culture, therefore, when talking to someone esteemed, the correct verb ending, which should have a lot of respect, must be chosen.     [ edit ]   Adjective   Words categorized as Korean  adjectives  (  ,  hyeong-yongsa ,   ) conjugate similarly to verbs, so some English texts call them ""descriptive verbs"" or "" stative verbs "", but they are distinctly separate from    ( tongsa ).   English does not have an identical grammatical category, so the English translation of Korean adjectives may misleadingly suggest that they are verbs. For example,    ( pukda ) translates literally as ""to be red"" and    ( aswipda ) often best translates as ""to lack"" or ""to want for"", but both are    ( hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""). For a larger list of Korean adjectives, see  wikt:Category:Korean adjectives .     [ edit ]   Determiner   Korean  determiners  (  ,  gwanhyeongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""determinatives"", ""adnominals"", ""pre-nouns"", ""attributives"", and ""unconjugated adjectives"". Examples include    ( kak , ""each""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean determiners .     [ edit ]   Noun   A large body of Korean  nouns  (  ,  myeongsa ,   ) stem from  Chinese characters , e.g.    (,  san , mountain),    (,  yeok , station),    (,  munhwa , culture), etc. Others are native to the Korean language, e.g.    ( nara , country),    ( nal , day). Many  Sino-Korean words  have a native Korean equivalent and vice versa, but not always. Nouns do not have  grammatical gender  and can be made  plural  by adding  to the end of the word, however in most instances the  singular  form is used even when in English it would be translated as plural. For example, while in English the sentence  ""there are three apples""  would use the plural  ""apples""  instead of the singular  ""apple"" , the Korean sentence    ( sagwa segae isssumnida ) maintains the word  ( sagwa , ""apple"") in its singular form, thus rendered in English as ""apple three(things) exist."" For a list of Korean nouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean nouns .     [ edit ]   Pronoun   Main article:  Korean pronouns   Korean  pronouns  (  ,  daemyeongsa ,   ) are highly influenced by the honorifics in the language. Pronouns change forms depending on the social status of the person or persons spoken to, e.g. the pronoun for ""I"" there is both the informal    ( na ) and the honorific/humble    ( jeo ). In general second person singular pronouns are avoided, especially when using honorific forms. For a larger list or Korean pronouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean pronouns .     [ edit ]   Adverb   Korean  adverbs  (  ,  busa ,   ) include    ( tto , ""also"") and    ( gadeuk , ""fully""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean adverbs .     [ edit ]   Particle   Korean  particles  (  ,  josa ,   ) are also known in English as "" postpositions "". Examples include    ( neun , topic marker) and    ( reul , object marker). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean particles .     [ edit ]   Interjection   Korean  interjections  (  ,  gamtansa ,   ) are also known in English as ""exclamations"". Examples include    ( ani , ""no""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean interjections .     [ edit ]   Number   Main article:  Korean numerals   Korean  numbers  or numerals (  ,  sutja ,   ) consitute two regularly used sets: a native Korean set and a  Sino-Korean  set. The Sino-Korean system is nearly entirely based on the  Chinese numerals . The distinction between the two numeral systems is very important. Everything that can be counted will use one of the two systems, but seldom both. Sino-Korean words are sometimes used to mark ordinal usage: yeol beon ( ) means ""ten times"" while sip beon (() ()) means ""number ten."" The grouping of large numbers in Korean follow the Chinese tradition of myriads (10000) rather than thousands (1000) as is common in Europe and North America.     [ edit ]   Speech levels and honorifics   Main article:  Korean honorifics   The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean, and the grammar reflects this. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject referent is reflected in  honorifics , while that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in  speech level .     [ edit ]   Honorifics   When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a younger stranger, student, employee or the like. Nowadays, there are special endings which can be used on declarative, interrogative, and imperative sentences; and both honorific or normal sentences. They are made for easier and faster use of Korean.     [ edit ]   Speech levels   There are seven verb  paradigms  or  speech levels  in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation. [ citation needed ]  Unlike  honorifics   which are used to show respect towards the referent   speech levels  are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience. The names of the 7 levels are derived from the non-honorific  imperative  form of the verb    ( hada , ""do"") in each level, plus the suffix  ('che',  hanja :   ), which means ""style.""   The highest 6 levels are generally grouped together as  jondaenmal  (), while the lowest level ( haeche , ) is called  banmal  () in Korean.     [ edit ]   Vocabulary   The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words. Like Japanese and Vietnamese, more than 50% of the vocabulary (up to 60% by some estimates), especially words that denote abstract ideas, are  Sino-Korean words , [ 7 ]  either     directly borrowed from  Written Chinese , or   coined in Japan or Korea using  Chinese characters ,     in a similar way European languages borrow from Latin and Greek. Korean has two  number systems : one native, and one borrowed from Chinese.   To a much lesser extent, words have also occasionally been borrowed from  Mongolian ,  Sanskrit , and other languages. Conversely, the Korean language itself has also contributed some loanwords to other languages, most notably the  Tsushima dialect  of Japanese.   The vast majority of loanwords other than Sino-Korean come from modern times, 90% of which are from  English . [ 8 ]  Many words have also been borrowed from  Japanese  and  Western languages  such as  German  ( areubaiteu  part-time job,  allereugi  allergy). Some Western words were borrowed indirectly via Japanese, taking a Japanese sound pattern, for example dozen >     dsu  >     daseu . Most indirect Western borrowings are now written according to current Hangulization rules for the respective Western language, as if borrowed directly. There are a few more complicated borrowings such as German(y) (see  Names for Germany ), the first part of whose  endonym   [d.lant]  the Japanese approximated using the  kanji      doitsu  that were then accepted into the Korean language by their Sino-Korean pronunciation:     dok  +     il  =  Dogil . In South Korean official use, a number of other Sino-Korean country names have been replaced with phonetically oriented Hangulizations of the countries' endonyms or English names.   North Korean vocabulary shows a tendency to prefer native Korean over Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings, especially with recent political objectives aimed at eliminating foreign (mostly Chinese) influences on the Korean language in the North. By contrast, South Korean may have several Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings which tend to be absent in North Korean.     [ edit ]   Writing system       Korean writing systems           Hangul       Hanja       Hyangchal   Gugyeol   Idu       Mixed script       Korean romanization       Revised Romanization of Korean   McCune-Reischauer   Yale Romanization           Main article:  Hangul   See also:  Hangul consonant and vowel tables   In ancient times, the languages of the Korean peninsula were written using  Chinese characters , using  hyangchal  or  idu . Such systems were not popular because hanja is not well suited to the Korean language. Its use is now limited.   Korean is now mainly written in Hangul, the Korean alphabet promulgated in 1446 by  Sejong the Great ;  hanja may be mixed in  to write  Sino-Korean words . South Korea still teaches 1800 hanja characters in its schools, while the North abolished the use of hanja decades ago.

Korean  punctuation  marks are almost identical to Western ones. Traditionally, Korean was written in columns from top to bottom, right to left, but is now usually written in rows from left to right, top to bottom.     [ edit ]   Differences between North Korean and South Korean   Main article:  Korean language North-South differences   The Korean language used in the North and the South exhibits differences in pronunciation, spelling, grammar and vocabulary. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Pronunciation   In North Korea,  palatalization  of  /si/  is optional, and  //  can be pronounced as  [z]  in between vowels.   Words that are written the same way may be pronounced differently, such as the examples below. The pronunciations below are given in  Revised Romanization ,  McCune-Reischauer  and Hangul, the last of which represents what the Hangul would be if one writes the word as pronounced.

(In the South, this rule only applies when it is attached to any single-character Sino-Korean word.)     [ edit ]   Spelling   Some words are spelled differently by the North and the South, but the pronunciations are the same.

[ edit ]   Spelling and pronunciation   Some words have different spellings and pronunciations in the North and the South, some of which were given in the ""Phonology"" section above:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          ryeongryang (ryngryang)      yeongnyang (yngnyang)   strength   Korean words originally starting in  r  or  n  have their  r  or  n  dropped in the South Korean version if the sound following it is an  i  or  y  sound.          rodong (rodong)      nodong (nodong)   work   Korean words originally starting in  r  have their  r  changed to  n  in the South Korean version if the sound following it is a sound other than  i  or  y .          wonssu (wnssu)      wonsu (wnsu)   mortal enemy   ""Mortal enemy"" and ""head of state"" are homophones in the South. Possibly to avoid referring to  Kim Il-sung  /  Kim Jong-il  as the enemy, the second syllable of ""enemy"" is written and pronounced  in the North.          rajio (rajio)      radio (radio)   radio            u (u)      wi (wi)   on; above            anhae (anhae)      anae (anae)   wife            kkuba (kkuba)      kuba (k'uba)   Cuba   When transcribing foreign words from languages that do not have contrasts between aspirated and unaspirated stops, North Koreans generally use tensed stops for the unaspirated ones while South Koreans use aspirated stops in both cases.          pe (p'e)      pye (p'ye), pe (p'e)   lungs   All hanja pronounced as  pye  ( p'ye ) or  pe  ( p'e ) in the South are pronounced as  pe  ( p'e ) in the North. The spelling is also accordingly different.       In general, when transcribing place names, North Korea tends to use the pronunciation in the original language more than South Korea, which often uses the pronunciation in English.

Although the Hangul differ, the pronunciations are the same (i.e. with the tensed  sound).

[ edit ]   Study by non-native speakers   The  United States '  Defense Language Institute  classifies Korean alongside  Arabic ,  Chinese , and  Japanese  as a Category IV language, meaning that 63 weeks of instruction (as compared to just 25 weeks for  French ,  Spanish ,  Portuguese , and  Italian ) are required to bring an English-speaking student to a limited working level of proficiency in which he or she has ""sufficient capability to meet routine social demands and limited job requirements"" and ""can deal with concrete topics in past, present, and future tense."" [ 10 ]  As a result, the study of the Korean language in the United States is dominated by  Korean American  heritage language students; they are estimated to form over 80% of all students of the language at non-military universities. [ 11 ]   However, Korean is considerably easier for speakers of certain other languages, such as Japanese, Mongolian and Turkic languages; in Japan, it is more widely studied by non-heritage learners. [ 12 ]  The  Korean Language Proficiency Test , an examination aimed at assessing non-native speakers' competence in Korean, was instituted in 1997; 17,000 people applied for the 2005 sitting of the examination.

Korean  (  /  , see  below ) is the official  language  of  North Korea  and  South Korea . It is also one of the two official languages in the  Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture  in  China . There are about 78 million Korean speakers. It was formerly written using  Hanja , borrowed  Chinese characters  pronounced in the Korean way. In the 15th century a national writing system was developed by  Sejong the Great , nowadays called  Hangul .   The genealogical  classification  of the Korean language is debated. Some linguists place it in the  Altaic  language family, while others consider it to be a  language isolate . It is  agglutinative  in its morphology and  SOV  in its  syntax .

In South Korea, the language is most often called  Hangungmal  (  ;   ), or more formally,  Hangugeo  (  ;   ) or  Gugeo  (  ;   ; literally ""national language"").   In North Korea and Yanbian in China, the language is most often called  Chosnmal  (  ; with  hanja :   ), or more formally,  Chosn  (  ;   ).   On the other hand, Korean people in the  former USSR , who refer to themselves as  Koryo-saram  (also  Goryeoin  [  ;   ; literally, "" Goryeo  person(s)""]) call the language  Goryeomal  (  ;   ).   In  mainland China , following the establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992, the term  Choxiny  (   or short form:  Choy  (  )) has normally been used to refer to the language spoken in North Korea and Yanbian, while  Hnguy  (   or short form:  Hny  (  )) is used to refer to the language spoken in South Korea.   Some older English sources also used the name ""Korean"" to refer to the language, country, and people.     [ edit ]   History   Main article:  History of the Korean language   Korean is descended from  Old Korean  and  Middle Korean .     [ edit ]   Classification   The classification of the modern Korean language is uncertain, and due to the lack of any one generally accepted theory, it is sometimes described conservatively as a  language isolate .   On the other hand, since the publication of the article of  Ramstedt  in 1926, many linguists support the hypothesis that Korean can be classified as an  Altaic  language, or as a relative of proto-Altaic. Korean is similar to Altaic languages in that they both lack certain grammatical elements, including  number ,  gender ,  articles , fusional morphology, voice, and  relative pronouns  (Kim Namkil). Korean especially bears some  morphological  resemblance to some languages of the Northern Turkic group, namely  Sakha (Yakut) . Vinokurova, a scholar of the Sakha language, noted that like in Korean, and unlike in other  Turkic languages  or a variety of other languages surveyed, adverbs in Sakha are derived from verbs with the help of derivational morphology; however, she did not suggest this implied any relation between the two languages. [ 2 ]   It is also considered likely that Korean is related in some way to  Japanese , since the two languages have nearly identical grammatical structures, and share a number of possible phonological cognates (though a majority of them are likely due to local pronunciations of the Chinese characters from which they are derived), as noted by such researchers as  Samuel E. Martin  and  Roy Andrew Miller  in the late 1960s.  Sergei Starostin  (1991) found about 25% of potential cognates in the Japanese-Korean 100-word  Swadesh list , which places these two languages closer together than other possible members of the Altaic family. [ 3 ]   Genetic relationships have been postulated both directly and indirectly, the latter either through placing both languages in the Altaic family, or by arguing for a relationship between Japanese and the  Buyeo languages  of  Goguryeo  and  Baekje  (see below); the proposed Baekje relationship is supported by cognates such as Baekje  mir , Japanese  mi-  ""three"". [ 4 ]   The possible relationship between Korean and Japanese can be exemplified by such basic vocabularly items as J.     mizu  (Old J.  midu ) : K.     mul  (Middle K.  mirh ) ""water"",  mot  ""lake""; J.     ku-ru  ""come"" (Old J.  ku , also cf. irregular root changes as in past tense   ki-ta , negative   ko-nai  in Modern J.) : K.     ka-da  (""go""); J.     kata-i  ""hard"" (whence     kata-na  ""knife, sword"") : K.  kud-yn  (hard); J.     i-ru  ""to be"" (past tense   i-ta ) : K.     i-da  ""to be""; J.  na ,  -en  : K.  anh  ""not"", J.  minna  (Old J.  mynna ) ""all, everyone"" : K.  manh-  ""many"" (predicate  mana-da ), etc.  [ 5 ] . The same possible cognates are often observed in other members of the potential  Altaic family , esp. in the  Tungusic languages . Cf. Nanay  mue  ""water"",  giagda-  ""to walk"",  anaa, anna  ""not"".   Others argue, however, that the similarities are not due to any genetic relationship, but rather to a  sprachbund  effect. [ citation needed ]  See  East Asian languages  for morphological features shared among languages of the East Asian  sprachbund , and  Classification of Japanese  for further details on the possible relationship. Though it is very difficult to believe words such as ""water"", ""to be"", and ""to go"" arise from sprachbund effects.   It is presumed that modern Korean may be more closely related to the languages of  Samhan  and  Silla  than the Buyeo languages; many Korean scholars believe they were mutually intelligible, and the collective basis of what in the  Goryeo  period would merge to become Middle Korean (the language before the changes that the  Seven-Year War  brought) and eventually Modern Korean. The  Jeju dialect  preserves some archaic features that can also be found in Middle Korean, whose  arae a  is retained in the dialect as a distinct vowel.   There are also more marginal hypotheses proposing various other relationships; for example, a few scholars, such as  Homer B. Hulbert  (1905), have tried to relate Korean to the  Dravidian languages  through the similar syntax in both. [ 6 ]   Though not related to Chinese, it has borrowed heavily; see the Vocabulary section below.     [ edit ]   Dialects   Main article:  Korean dialects          Dialects of Korean       Korean has several  dialects  (called  mal  [literally ""speech""],  saturi , or  bang-eon  in Korean). The  standard language  ( pyojuneo  or  pyojunmal ) of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  P'yngyang . All dialects of Korean are similar to each other, and are in fact all mutually intelligible, perhaps with the exception of the dialect of  Jeju Island  (see  Jeju dialect ). The dialect spoken in Jeju is in fact classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of  Seoul dialect  use very little stress, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of the  Gyeongsang dialect  have a very pronounced intonation.   It is also worth noting that there is substantial evidence for a history of extensive  dialect levelling , or even  convergent evolution  or intermixture of two or more originally distinct linguistic stocks, within the Korean language and its dialects. Many Korean dialects have basic vocabulary that is etymologically distinct from vocabulary of identical meaning in Standard Korean or other dialects, such as South Jeolla dialect /kur/ vs. Standard Korean     /ip/  ""mouth"" or Gyeongsang dialect  /.u.i/  vs. Standard Korean  /puu/  "" garlic chives ."" This suggests that the Korean Peninsula may have at one time been much more linguistically diverse than it is at present. See also the  Buyeo languages   hypothesis .   There is a very close connection between the dialects of Korean and the  regions of Korea , since the boundaries of both are largely determined by mountains and seas. Here is a list of traditional dialect names and locations:       Standard dialect   Where used       Seoul   Seoul  (),  Incheon  (/), most of  Gyeonggi  (/)       P'yngan  (/)   P'yngyang ,  P'yngan  region,  Chagang  (North Korea)       Regional dialect   Where used       Gyeonggi   limited areas of the  Gyeonggi  region (South Korea)       Chungcheong   Daejeon ,  Chungcheong  region (South Korea)       Gangwon   Gangwon-do (South Korea) / Kangwn (North Korea)       Gyeongsang   Busan ,  Daegu ,  Ulsan ,  Gyeongsang  region (South Korea)       Hamgyng   Rasn ,  Hamgyng  region,  Ryanggang  (North Korea)       Hwanghae   Hwanghae  region (North Korea)       Jeju   Jeju Island/Province  (South Korea)       Jeolla   Gwangju ,  Jeolla  region (South Korea)         [ edit ]   Phonology       This article contains  IPA  phonetic symbols.

Main article:  Korean phonology     [ edit ]   Consonants          The Korean consonants             Bilabial   Alveolar   Post-  alveolar   Velar   Glottal       Nasal      /m/      /n/        //  (syllable-final)         Plosive  and   Affricate   plain      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         tense      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         aspirated      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         Fricative   plain        /s/          /h/       tense        /s/             Liquid        /l/           The  IPA  symbol <  > (a subscript double straight quotation mark, shown here with a placeholder circle) is used to denote the tensed consonants  /p/, /t/, /k/, //, /s/ . Its official use in the  Extensions to the IPA  is for  'strong'  articulation, but is used in the literature for  faucalized voice . The Korean consonants also have elements of  stiff voice , but it is not yet known how typical this is of faucalized consonants. They are produced with a partially constricted  glottis  and additional subglottal pressure in addition to tense vocal tract walls, laryngeal lowering, or other expansion of the larynx.     [ edit ]   Vowels                    The Korean basic vowels                 Monophthongs   /i/    ,  /e/    ,  //    ,  /a/    ,  /o/    ,  /u/    ,  //    ,  //    ,  //          Vowels preceded by intermediaries,  or Diphthongs   /je/    ,  /j/    ,  /ja/    ,  /wi/    ,  /we/    ,  /w/    ,  /wa/    ,  /i/    ,  /jo/    ,  /ju/    ,  /j/    ,  /w/            [ edit ]   Allophones   /s/  becomes an  alveolo-palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i]  for most speakers (but see  Differences in the language between North Korea and South Korea ). This occurs with the tense fricative and all the affricates as well. At the end of a syllable, /s/ changes to /t/ (Example: beoseot () 'mushroom').   /h/  may become a  bilabial   []  before  [o]  or  [u] , a  palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i] , a  velar   [x]  before  [] , a voiced  []  between voiced sounds, and a  [h]  elsewhere. [ citation needed ]   /p, t, , k/  become voiced  [b, d, , ]  between voiced sounds.   /l/  becomes alveolar flap  []  between vowels, and  [l]  or  []  at the end of a syllable or next to another  /l/ . Note that a written syllable-final '', when followed by a vowel or a glide ( i.e. , when the next character starts with ''), migrates to the next syllable and thus becomes  [] .   Traditionally,  /l/  was disallowed at the beginning of a word. It disappeared before  [j] , and otherwise became  /n/ . However, the inflow of western loanword changed the trend, and now word-initial  /l/  (mostly from English loanwords) are pronounced as a free variation of either  []  or  [l] . The traditional prohibition of word-initial  /l/  became a morphological rule called ""initial law"" () in South Korea, which pertains to Sino-Korean vocabulary. Such words retain their word-initial  /l/  in North Korea.   All  obstruents  (plosives, affricates, fricatives) are  unreleased   [p, t, k]  at the end of a word.   Plosive stops  /p, t, k/  become nasal stops  [m, n, ]  before nasal stops.   Hangul  spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying, partly historical  morphology . Given this, it is sometimes hard to tell which actual phonemes are present in a certain word.   One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial  [r] , and initial  [n] . For example,     ""labour"" - north:  r odong  (), south:  n odong  ()   ""history"" - north:  ry ksa  (), south:  y eoksa  ()   ""female"" - north:  ny ja  (), south:  y eoja  ()       [ edit ]   Morphophonemics   Grammatical morphemes may change shape depending on the preceding sounds. Examples include  -eun/-neun  (-/-) and  -i/-ga  (-/-). Sometimes sounds may be inserted instead. Examples include  -eul/-reul  (-/-),  -euro/-ro  (-/-),  -eseo/-seo  (-/-),  -ideunji/-deunji  (-/-) and  -iya/-ya  (-/-). However,  -euro/-ro  is somewhat irregular, since it will behave differently after a rieul consonant.     Korean particles     After a consonant   After a rieul   After a vowel       -ui  (-)       -eun  (-)   -neun  (-)       -i  (-)   -ga  (-)       -eul  (-)   -reul  (-)       -gwa  (-)   -wa  (-)       -euro  (-)   -ro  (-)       Some verbs may also change shape morphophonemically.     [ edit ]   Grammar   Main article:  Korean grammar     [ edit ]   Sentence structure   Korean is an  agglutinative language . Modifiers generally follow the modified word, and in the case of verb modifiers, can be serially appended. The basic form of a Korean sentence is  Subject Object Verb , but the verb is the only required and immovable element.       A :       -       -? (?)           kage-e     kasseo-yo           store + [location marker ()]     [go (verb root) ()]+[conjunctive ()]+[past ()]+[conjunctive ()]+ [polite marker ()]         ""Did [you] go to the store?"" (with ""you"" implied by context)         B :       .           ye           yes         ""Yes.""       [ edit ]   Parts of speech     [ edit ]   Verb   Korean  verbs  (  ,  tongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""action verbs"" or ""dynamic verbs"" to distinguish them from [  () ,  hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""]), which are also known as ""descriptive verbs"" or ""stative verbs"". Examples of action/dynamic verbs include    ( hada , ""to do"") and    ( kada , ""to go"") which constitute an action or movement as opposed to descriptive verbs such as    ( yehppeuda , ""to be beautiful""). For a larger list of Korean verbs, see  wikt:Category:Korean verbs .   Unlike most of the European languages, Korean does not conjugate verbs using agreement with the subject, and nouns have no gender. Instead, verb conjugations depend upon the verb tense, aspect, mood, and the social relation between the speaker, the subjects, and the listeners. The system of speech levels and honorifics loosely resembles the  T-V distinction  of most  Indo-European languages . For example, different endings are used based on the speaker's relation with the person they are talking to or the person about which they are talking. Politeness is a critical part of Korean language and Korean culture, therefore, when talking to someone esteemed, the correct verb ending, which should have a lot of respect, must be chosen.     [ edit ]   Adjective   Words categorized as Korean  adjectives  (  ,  hyeong-yongsa ,   ) conjugate similarly to verbs, so some English texts call them ""descriptive verbs"" or "" stative verbs "", but they are distinctly separate from    ( tongsa ).   English does not have an identical grammatical category, so the English translation of Korean adjectives may misleadingly suggest that they are verbs. For example,    ( pukda ) translates literally as ""to be red"" and    ( aswipda ) often best translates as ""to lack"" or ""to want for"", but both are    ( hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""). For a larger list of Korean adjectives, see  wikt:Category:Korean adjectives .     [ edit ]   Determiner   Korean  determiners  (  ,  gwanhyeongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""determinatives"", ""adnominals"", ""pre-nouns"", ""attributives"", and ""unconjugated adjectives"". Examples include    ( kak , ""each""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean determiners .     [ edit ]   Noun   A large body of Korean  nouns  (  ,  myeongsa ,   ) stem from  Chinese characters , e.g.    (,  san , mountain),    (,  yeok , station),    (,  munhwa , culture), etc. Others are native to the Korean language, e.g.    ( nara , country),    ( nal , day). Many  Sino-Korean words  have a native Korean equivalent and vice versa, but not always. Nouns do not have  grammatical gender  and can be made  plural  by adding  to the end of the word, however in most instances the  singular  form is used even when in English it would be translated as plural. For example, while in English the sentence  ""there are three apples""  would use the plural  ""apples""  instead of the singular  ""apple"" , the Korean sentence    ( sagwa segae isssumnida ) maintains the word  ( sagwa , ""apple"") in its singular form, thus rendered in English as ""apple three(things) exist."" For a list of Korean nouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean nouns .     [ edit ]   Pronoun   Main article:  Korean pronouns   Korean  pronouns  (  ,  daemyeongsa ,   ) are highly influenced by the honorifics in the language. Pronouns change forms depending on the social status of the person or persons spoken to, e.g. the pronoun for ""I"" there is both the informal    ( na ) and the honorific/humble    ( jeo ). In general second person singular pronouns are avoided, especially when using honorific forms. For a larger list or Korean pronouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean pronouns .     [ edit ]   Adverb   Korean  adverbs  (  ,  busa ,   ) include    ( tto , ""also"") and    ( gadeuk , ""fully""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean adverbs .     [ edit ]   Particle   Korean  particles  (  ,  josa ,   ) are also known in English as "" postpositions "". Examples include    ( neun , topic marker) and    ( reul , object marker). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean particles .     [ edit ]   Interjection   Korean  interjections  (  ,  gamtansa ,   ) are also known in English as ""exclamations"". Examples include    ( ani , ""no""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean interjections .     [ edit ]   Number   Main article:  Korean numerals   Korean  numbers  or numerals (  ,  sutja ,   ) consitute two regularly used sets: a native Korean set and a  Sino-Korean  set. The Sino-Korean system is nearly entirely based on the  Chinese numerals . The distinction between the two numeral systems is very important. Everything that can be counted will use one of the two systems, but seldom both. Sino-Korean words are sometimes used to mark ordinal usage: yeol beon ( ) means ""ten times"" while sip beon (() ()) means ""number ten."" The grouping of large numbers in Korean follow the Chinese tradition of myriads (10000) rather than thousands (1000) as is common in Europe and North America.     [ edit ]   Speech levels and honorifics   Main article:  Korean honorifics   The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean, and the grammar reflects this. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject referent is reflected in  honorifics , while that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in  speech level .     [ edit ]   Honorifics   When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a younger stranger, student, employee or the like. Nowadays, there are special endings which can be used on declarative, interrogative, and imperative sentences; and both honorific or normal sentences. They are made for easier and faster use of Korean.     [ edit ]   Speech levels   There are seven verb  paradigms  or  speech levels  in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation. [ citation needed ]  Unlike  honorifics   which are used to show respect towards the referent   speech levels  are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience. The names of the 7 levels are derived from the non-honorific  imperative  form of the verb    ( hada , ""do"") in each level, plus the suffix  ('che',  hanja :   ), which means ""style.""   The highest 6 levels are generally grouped together as  jondaenmal  (), while the lowest level ( haeche , ) is called  banmal  () in Korean.     [ edit ]   Vocabulary   The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words. Like Japanese and Vietnamese, more than 50% of the vocabulary (up to 60% by some estimates), especially words that denote abstract ideas, are  Sino-Korean words , [ 7 ]  either     directly borrowed from  Written Chinese , or   coined in Japan or Korea using  Chinese characters ,     in a similar way European languages borrow from Latin and Greek. Korean has two  number systems : one native, and one borrowed from Chinese.   To a much lesser extent, words have also occasionally been borrowed from  Mongolian ,  Sanskrit , and other languages. Conversely, the Korean language itself has also contributed some loanwords to other languages, most notably the  Tsushima dialect  of Japanese.   The vast majority of loanwords other than Sino-Korean come from modern times, 90% of which are from  English . [ 8 ]  Many words have also been borrowed from  Japanese  and  Western languages  such as  German  ( areubaiteu  part-time job,  allereugi  allergy). Some Western words were borrowed indirectly via Japanese, taking a Japanese sound pattern, for example dozen >     dsu  >     daseu . Most indirect Western borrowings are now written according to current Hangulization rules for the respective Western language, as if borrowed directly. There are a few more complicated borrowings such as German(y) (see  Names for Germany ), the first part of whose  endonym   [d.lant]  the Japanese approximated using the  kanji      doitsu  that were then accepted into the Korean language by their Sino-Korean pronunciation:     dok  +     il  =  Dogil . In South Korean official use, a number of other Sino-Korean country names have been replaced with phonetically oriented Hangulizations of the countries' endonyms or English names.   North Korean vocabulary shows a tendency to prefer native Korean over Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings, especially with recent political objectives aimed at eliminating foreign (mostly Chinese) influences on the Korean language in the North. By contrast, South Korean may have several Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings which tend to be absent in North Korean.

Such systems were not popular because hanja is not well suited to the Korean language. Its use is now limited.   Korean is now mainly written in Hangul, the Korean alphabet promulgated in 1446 by  Sejong the Great ;  hanja may be mixed in  to write  Sino-Korean words . South Korea still teaches 1800 hanja characters in its schools, while the North abolished the use of hanja decades ago.

Korean  punctuation  marks are almost identical to Western ones. Traditionally, Korean was written in columns from top to bottom, right to left, but is now usually written in rows from left to right, top to bottom.     [ edit ]   Differences between North Korean and South Korean   Main article:  Korean language North-South differences   The Korean language used in the North and the South exhibits differences in pronunciation, spelling, grammar and vocabulary. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Pronunciation   In North Korea,  palatalization  of  /si/  is optional, and  //  can be pronounced as  [z]  in between vowels.   Words that are written the same way may be pronounced differently, such as the examples below. The pronunciations below are given in  Revised Romanization ,  McCune-Reischauer  and Hangul, the last of which represents what the Hangul would be if one writes the word as pronounced.

(In the South, this rule only applies when it is attached to any single-character Sino-Korean word.)     [ edit ]   Spelling   Some words are spelled differently by the North and the South, but the pronunciations are the same.

[ edit ]   Spelling and pronunciation   Some words have different spellings and pronunciations in the North and the South, some of which were given in the ""Phonology"" section above:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          ryeongryang (ryngryang)      yeongnyang (yngnyang)   strength   Korean words originally starting in  r  or  n  have their  r  or  n  dropped in the South Korean version if the sound following it is an  i  or  y  sound.          rodong (rodong)      nodong (nodong)   work   Korean words originally starting in  r  have their  r  changed to  n  in the South Korean version if the sound following it is a sound other than  i  or  y .          wonssu (wnssu)      wonsu (wnsu)   mortal enemy   ""Mortal enemy"" and ""head of state"" are homophones in the South. Possibly to avoid referring to  Kim Il-sung  /  Kim Jong-il  as the enemy, the second syllable of ""enemy"" is written and pronounced  in the North.          rajio (rajio)      radio (radio)   radio            u (u)      wi (wi)   on; above            anhae (anhae)      anae (anae)   wife            kkuba (kkuba)      kuba (k'uba)   Cuba   When transcribing foreign words from languages that do not have contrasts between aspirated and unaspirated stops, North Koreans generally use tensed stops for the unaspirated ones while South Koreans use aspirated stops in both cases.          pe (p'e)      pye (p'ye), pe (p'e)   lungs   All hanja pronounced as  pye  ( p'ye ) or  pe  ( p'e ) in the South are pronounced as  pe  ( p'e ) in the North. The spelling is also accordingly different.       In general, when transcribing place names, North Korea tends to use the pronunciation in the original language more than South Korea, which often uses the pronunciation in English. For example:       Original name   North Korea transliteration   English name   South Korea transliteration       Spelling   Pronunciation   Spelling   Pronunciaton       Ulaanbaatar      ullanbattareu (ullanbattar)   Ulan Bator      ullanbatoreu (ullanbat'or)       Kbenhavn      koeppenhabeun (k'oeppenhabn)   Copenhagen      kopenhagen (k'op'enhagen)       al-Qhirah      kkahira (kkahira)   Cairo      kairo (k'airo)         [ edit ]   Grammar   Some grammatical constructions are also different:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          doeyeotda (toeytta)      doeeotda (toetta)   past tense of  (doeda/toeda), ""to become""   All similar grammar forms of verbs or adjectives that end in  in the stem (i.e. , , , ,  and ) in the North use  instead of the South's .          gomawayo (komawayo)      gomawoyo (komawyo)   thanks   -irregular verbs in the North use  (wa) for all those with a positive ending vowel; this only happens in the South if the verb stem has only one syllable.          halgayo (halkayo)      halkkayo (halkkayo)   Shall we do?   Although the Hangul differ, the pronunciations are the same (i.e. with the tensed  sound).         [ edit ]   Vocabulary   Some vocabulary is different between the North and the South:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          munhwajutaek (munhwajut'aek)      apateu (ap'at')   Apartment     (appateu/appat') is also used in the North.          joseonmal (chosnmal)      han-gugeo(han'gugeo)   Korean language            gwakbap (kwakpap)      dosirak (tosirak)   lunch box           [ edit ]   Others   In the North,  guillemets     and    are the symbols used for quotes; in the South, quotation marks equivalent to the English ones,  and , are standard, although     and     are sometimes used in popular novels.     [ edit ]   Study by non-native speakers   The  United States '  Defense Language Institute  classifies Korean alongside  Arabic ,  Chinese , and  Japanese  as a Category IV language, meaning that 63 weeks of instruction (as compared to just 25 weeks for  French ,  Spanish ,  Portuguese , and  Italian ) are required to bring an English-speaking student to a limited working level of proficiency in which he or she has ""sufficient capability to meet routine social demands and limited job requirements"" and ""can deal with concrete topics in past, present, and future tense."" [ 10 ]  As a result, the study of the Korean language in the United States is dominated by  Korean American  heritage language students; they are estimated to form over 80% of all students of the language at non-military universities. [ 11 ]   However, Korean is considerably easier for speakers of certain other languages, such as Japanese, Mongolian and Turkic languages; in Japan, it is more widely studied by non-heritage learners. [ 12 ]  The  Korean Language Proficiency Test , an examination aimed at assessing non-native speakers' competence in Korean, was instituted in 1997; 17,000 people applied for the 2005 sitting of the examination.

There are about 78 million Korean speakers. It was formerly written using  Hanja , borrowed  Chinese characters  pronounced in the Korean way. In the 15th century a national writing system was developed by  Sejong the Great , nowadays called  Hangul .   The genealogical  classification  of the Korean language is debated.

In South Korea, the language is most often called  Hangungmal  (  ;   ), or more formally,  Hangugeo  (  ;   ) or  Gugeo  (  ;   ; literally ""national language"").   In North Korea and Yanbian in China, the language is most often called  Chosnmal  (  ; with  hanja :   ), or more formally,  Chosn  (  ;   ).   On the other hand, Korean people in the  former USSR , who refer to themselves as  Koryo-saram  (also  Goryeoin  [  ;   ; literally, "" Goryeo  person(s)""]) call the language  Goryeomal  (  ;   ).   In  mainland China , following the establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992, the term  Choxiny  (   or short form:  Choy  (  )) has normally been used to refer to the language spoken in North Korea and Yanbian, while  Hnguy  (   or short form:  Hny  (  )) is used to refer to the language spoken in South Korea.   Some older English sources also used the name ""Korean"" to refer to the language, country, and people.     [ edit ]   History   Main article:  History of the Korean language   Korean is descended from  Old Korean  and  Middle Korean .     [ edit ]   Classification   The classification of the modern Korean language is uncertain, and due to the lack of any one generally accepted theory, it is sometimes described conservatively as a  language isolate .   On the other hand, since the publication of the article of  Ramstedt  in 1926, many linguists support the hypothesis that Korean can be classified as an  Altaic  language, or as a relative of proto-Altaic. Korean is similar to Altaic languages in that they both lack certain grammatical elements, including  number ,  gender ,  articles , fusional morphology, voice, and  relative pronouns  (Kim Namkil). Korean especially bears some  morphological  resemblance to some languages of the Northern Turkic group, namely  Sakha (Yakut) . Vinokurova, a scholar of the Sakha language, noted that like in Korean, and unlike in other  Turkic languages  or a variety of other languages surveyed, adverbs in Sakha are derived from verbs with the help of derivational morphology; however, she did not suggest this implied any relation between the two languages. [ 2 ]   It is also considered likely that Korean is related in some way to  Japanese , since the two languages have nearly identical grammatical structures, and share a number of possible phonological cognates (though a majority of them are likely due to local pronunciations of the Chinese characters from which they are derived), as noted by such researchers as  Samuel E. Martin  and  Roy Andrew Miller  in the late 1960s.  Sergei Starostin  (1991) found about 25% of potential cognates in the Japanese-Korean 100-word  Swadesh list , which places these two languages closer together than other possible members of the Altaic family. [ 3 ]   Genetic relationships have been postulated both directly and indirectly, the latter either through placing both languages in the Altaic family, or by arguing for a relationship between Japanese and the  Buyeo languages  of  Goguryeo  and  Baekje  (see below); the proposed Baekje relationship is supported by cognates such as Baekje  mir , Japanese  mi-  ""three"". [ 4 ]   The possible relationship between Korean and Japanese can be exemplified by such basic vocabularly items as J.     mizu  (Old J.  midu ) : K.     mul  (Middle K.  mirh ) ""water"",  mot  ""lake""; J.     ku-ru  ""come"" (Old J.  ku , also cf. irregular root changes as in past tense   ki-ta , negative   ko-nai  in Modern J.) : K.     ka-da  (""go""); J.     kata-i  ""hard"" (whence     kata-na  ""knife, sword"") : K.  kud-yn  (hard); J.     i-ru  ""to be"" (past tense   i-ta ) : K.     i-da  ""to be""; J.  na ,  -en  : K.  anh  ""not"", J.  minna  (Old J.  mynna ) ""all, everyone"" : K.  manh-  ""many"" (predicate  mana-da ), etc.  [ 5 ] . The same possible cognates are often observed in other members of the potential  Altaic family , esp. in the  Tungusic languages . Cf. Nanay  mue  ""water"",  giagda-  ""to walk"",  anaa, anna  ""not"".   Others argue, however, that the similarities are not due to any genetic relationship, but rather to a  sprachbund  effect. [ citation needed ]  See  East Asian languages  for morphological features shared among languages of the East Asian  sprachbund , and  Classification of Japanese  for further details on the possible relationship. Though it is very difficult to believe words such as ""water"", ""to be"", and ""to go"" arise from sprachbund effects.   It is presumed that modern Korean may be more closely related to the languages of  Samhan  and  Silla  than the Buyeo languages; many Korean scholars believe they were mutually intelligible, and the collective basis of what in the  Goryeo  period would merge to become Middle Korean (the language before the changes that the  Seven-Year War  brought) and eventually Modern Korean. The  Jeju dialect  preserves some archaic features that can also be found in Middle Korean, whose  arae a  is retained in the dialect as a distinct vowel.   There are also more marginal hypotheses proposing various other relationships; for example, a few scholars, such as  Homer B. Hulbert  (1905), have tried to relate Korean to the  Dravidian languages  through the similar syntax in both. [ 6 ]   Though not related to Chinese, it has borrowed heavily; see the Vocabulary section below.     [ edit ]   Dialects   Main article:  Korean dialects          Dialects of Korean       Korean has several  dialects  (called  mal  [literally ""speech""],  saturi , or  bang-eon  in Korean). The  standard language  ( pyojuneo  or  pyojunmal ) of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  P'yngyang . All dialects of Korean are similar to each other, and are in fact all mutually intelligible, perhaps with the exception of the dialect of  Jeju Island  (see  Jeju dialect ). The dialect spoken in Jeju is in fact classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of  Seoul dialect  use very little stress, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of the  Gyeongsang dialect  have a very pronounced intonation.   It is also worth noting that there is substantial evidence for a history of extensive  dialect levelling , or even  convergent evolution  or intermixture of two or more originally distinct linguistic stocks, within the Korean language and its dialects. Many Korean dialects have basic vocabulary that is etymologically distinct from vocabulary of identical meaning in Standard Korean or other dialects, such as South Jeolla dialect /kur/ vs. Standard Korean     /ip/  ""mouth"" or Gyeongsang dialect  /.u.i/  vs. Standard Korean  /puu/  "" garlic chives ."" This suggests that the Korean Peninsula may have at one time been much more linguistically diverse than it is at present. See also the  Buyeo languages   hypothesis .   There is a very close connection between the dialects of Korean and the  regions of Korea , since the boundaries of both are largely determined by mountains and seas.

Main article:  Korean phonology     [ edit ]   Consonants          The Korean consonants             Bilabial   Alveolar   Post-  alveolar   Velar   Glottal       Nasal      /m/      /n/        //  (syllable-final)         Plosive  and   Affricate   plain      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         tense      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         aspirated      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         Fricative   plain        /s/          /h/       tense        /s/             Liquid        /l/           The  IPA  symbol <  > (a subscript double straight quotation mark, shown here with a placeholder circle) is used to denote the tensed consonants  /p/, /t/, /k/, //, /s/ . Its official use in the  Extensions to the IPA  is for  'strong'  articulation, but is used in the literature for  faucalized voice . The Korean consonants also have elements of  stiff voice , but it is not yet known how typical this is of faucalized consonants. They are produced with a partially constricted  glottis  and additional subglottal pressure in addition to tense vocal tract walls, laryngeal lowering, or other expansion of the larynx.     [ edit ]   Vowels                    The Korean basic vowels                 Monophthongs   /i/    ,  /e/    ,  //    ,  /a/    ,  /o/    ,  /u/    ,  //    ,  //    ,  //          Vowels preceded by intermediaries,  or Diphthongs   /je/    ,  /j/    ,  /ja/    ,  /wi/    ,  /we/    ,  /w/    ,  /wa/    ,  /i/    ,  /jo/    ,  /ju/    ,  /j/    ,  /w/            [ edit ]   Allophones   /s/  becomes an  alveolo-palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i]  for most speakers (but see  Differences in the language between North Korea and South Korea ). This occurs with the tense fricative and all the affricates as well. At the end of a syllable, /s/ changes to /t/ (Example: beoseot () 'mushroom').   /h/  may become a  bilabial   []  before  [o]  or  [u] , a  palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i] , a  velar   [x]  before  [] , a voiced  []  between voiced sounds, and a  [h]  elsewhere. [ citation needed ]   /p, t, , k/  become voiced  [b, d, , ]  between voiced sounds.   /l/  becomes alveolar flap  []  between vowels, and  [l]  or  []  at the end of a syllable or next to another  /l/ . Note that a written syllable-final '', when followed by a vowel or a glide ( i.e. , when the next character starts with ''), migrates to the next syllable and thus becomes  [] .   Traditionally,  /l/  was disallowed at the beginning of a word. It disappeared before  [j] , and otherwise became  /n/ . However, the inflow of western loanword changed the trend, and now word-initial  /l/  (mostly from English loanwords) are pronounced as a free variation of either  []  or  [l] . The traditional prohibition of word-initial  /l/  became a morphological rule called ""initial law"" () in South Korea, which pertains to Sino-Korean vocabulary. Such words retain their word-initial  /l/  in North Korea.   All  obstruents  (plosives, affricates, fricatives) are  unreleased   [p, t, k]  at the end of a word.   Plosive stops  /p, t, k/  become nasal stops  [m, n, ]  before nasal stops.   Hangul  spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying, partly historical  morphology . Given this, it is sometimes hard to tell which actual phonemes are present in a certain word.   One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial  [r] , and initial  [n] . For example,     ""labour"" - north:  r odong  (), south:  n odong  ()   ""history"" - north:  ry ksa  (), south:  y eoksa  ()   ""female"" - north:  ny ja  (), south:  y eoja  ()       [ edit ]   Morphophonemics   Grammatical morphemes may change shape depending on the preceding sounds. Examples include  -eun/-neun  (-/-) and  -i/-ga  (-/-). Sometimes sounds may be inserted instead. Examples include  -eul/-reul  (-/-),  -euro/-ro  (-/-),  -eseo/-seo  (-/-),  -ideunji/-deunji  (-/-) and  -iya/-ya  (-/-). However,  -euro/-ro  is somewhat irregular, since it will behave differently after a rieul consonant.     Korean particles     After a consonant   After a rieul   After a vowel       -ui  (-)       -eun  (-)   -neun  (-)       -i  (-)   -ga  (-)       -eul  (-)   -reul  (-)       -gwa  (-)   -wa  (-)       -euro  (-)   -ro  (-)       Some verbs may also change shape morphophonemically.     [ edit ]   Grammar   Main article:  Korean grammar     [ edit ]   Sentence structure   Korean is an  agglutinative language . Modifiers generally follow the modified word, and in the case of verb modifiers, can be serially appended. The basic form of a Korean sentence is  Subject Object Verb , but the verb is the only required and immovable element.       A :       -       -? (?)           kage-e     kasseo-yo           store + [location marker ()]     [go (verb root) ()]+[conjunctive ()]+[past ()]+[conjunctive ()]+ [polite marker ()]         ""Did [you] go to the store?"" (with ""you"" implied by context)         B :       .           ne           yes         ""Yes.""       [ edit ]   Parts of speech     [ edit ]   Verb   Korean  verbs  (  ,  tongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""action verbs"" or ""dynamic verbs"" to distinguish them from [  () ,  hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""]), which are also known as ""descriptive verbs"" or ""stative verbs"". Examples of action/dynamic verbs include    ( hada , ""to do"") and    ( kada , ""to go"") which constitute an action or movement as opposed to descriptive verbs such as    ( yehppeuda , ""to be beautiful""). For a larger list of Korean verbs, see  wikt:Category:Korean verbs .   Unlike most of the European languages, Korean does not conjugate verbs using agreement with the subject, and nouns have no gender. Instead, verb conjugations depend upon the verb tense, aspect, mood, and the social relation between the speaker, the subjects, and the listeners. The system of speech levels and honorifics loosely resembles the  T-V distinction  of most  Indo-European languages . For example, different endings are used based on the speaker's relation with the person they are talking to or the person about which they are talking. Politeness is a critical part of Korean language and Korean culture, therefore, when talking to someone esteemed, the correct verb ending, which should have a lot of respect, must be chosen.     [ edit ]   Adjective   Words categorized as Korean  adjectives  (  ,  hyeong-yongsa ,   ) conjugate similarly to verbs, so some English texts call them ""descriptive verbs"" or "" stative verbs "", but they are distinctly separate from    ( tongsa ).   English does not have an identical grammatical category, so the English translation of Korean adjectives may misleadingly suggest that they are verbs. For example,    ( pukda ) translates literally as ""to be red"" and    ( aswipda ) often best translates as ""to lack"" or ""to want for"", but both are    ( hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""). For a larger list of Korean adjectives, see  wikt:Category:Korean adjectives .     [ edit ]   Determiner   Korean  determiners  (  ,  gwanhyeongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""determinatives"", ""adnominals"", ""pre-nouns"", ""attributives"", and ""unconjugated adjectives"". Examples include    ( kak , ""each""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean determiners .     [ edit ]   Noun   A large body of Korean  nouns  (  ,  myeongsa ,   ) stem from  Chinese characters , e.g.    (,  san , mountain),    (,  yeok , station),    (,  munhwa , culture), etc. Others are native to the Korean language, e.g.    ( nara , country),    ( nal , day). Many  Sino-Korean words  have a native Korean equivalent and vice versa, but not always. Nouns do not have  grammatical gender  and can be made  plural  by adding  to the end of the word, however in most instances the  singular  form is used even when in English it would be translated as plural. For example, while in English the sentence  ""there are three apples""  would use the plural  ""apples""  instead of the singular  ""apple"" , the Korean sentence    ( sagwa segae isssumnida ) maintains the word  ( sagwa , ""apple"") in its singular form, thus rendered in English as ""apple three(things) exist."" For a list of Korean nouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean nouns .     [ edit ]   Pronoun   Main article:  Korean pronouns   Korean  pronouns  (  ,  daemyeongsa ,   ) are highly influenced by the honorifics in the language. Pronouns change forms depending on the social status of the person or persons spoken to, e.g. the pronoun for ""I"" there is both the informal    ( na ) and the honorific/humble    ( jeo ). In general second person singular pronouns are avoided, especially when using honorific forms. For a larger list or Korean pronouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean pronouns .     [ edit ]   Adverb   Korean  adverbs  (  ,  busa ,   ) include    ( tto , ""also"") and    ( gadeuk , ""fully""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean adverbs .     [ edit ]   Particle   Korean  particles  (  ,  josa ,   ) are also known in English as "" postpositions "". Examples include    ( neun , topic marker) and    ( reul , object marker). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean particles .     [ edit ]   Interjection   Korean  interjections  (  ,  gamtansa ,   ) are also known in English as ""exclamations"". Examples include    ( ani , ""no""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean interjections .     [ edit ]   Number   Main article:  Korean numerals   Korean  numbers  or numerals (  ,  sutja ,   ) consitute two regularly used sets: a native Korean set and a  Sino-Korean  set. The Sino-Korean system is nearly entirely based on the  Chinese numerals . The distinction between the two numeral systems is very important. Everything that can be counted will use one of the two systems, but seldom both. Sino-Korean words are sometimes used to mark ordinal usage: yeol beon ( ) means ""ten times"" while sip beon (() ()) means ""number ten."" The grouping of large numbers in Korean follow the Chinese tradition of myriads (10000) rather than thousands (1000) as is common in Europe and North America.     [ edit ]   Speech levels and honorifics   Main article:  Korean honorifics   The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean, and the grammar reflects this. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject referent is reflected in  honorifics , while that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in  speech level .     [ edit ]   Honorifics   When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a younger stranger, student, employee or the like. Nowadays, there are special endings which can be used on declarative, interrogative, and imperative sentences; and both honorific or normal sentences. They are made for easier and faster use of Korean.     [ edit ]   Speech levels   There are seven verb  paradigms  or  speech levels  in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation. [ citation needed ]  Unlike  honorifics   which are used to show respect towards the referent   speech levels  are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience. The names of the 7 levels are derived from the non-honorific  imperative  form of the verb    ( hada , ""do"") in each level, plus the suffix  ('che',  hanja :   ), which means ""style.""   The highest 6 levels are generally grouped together as  jondaenmal  (), while the lowest level ( haeche , ) is called  banmal  () in Korean.     [ edit ]   Vocabulary   The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words. Like Japanese and Vietnamese, more than 50% of the vocabulary (up to 60% by some estimates), especially words that denote abstract ideas, are  Sino-Korean words , [ 7 ]  either     directly borrowed from  Written Chinese , or   coined in Japan or Korea using  Chinese characters ,     in a similar way European languages borrow from Latin and Greek. Korean has two  number systems : one native, and one borrowed from Chinese.   To a much lesser extent, words have also occasionally been borrowed from  Mongolian ,  Sanskrit , and other languages. Conversely, the Korean language itself has also contributed some loanwords to other languages, most notably the  Tsushima dialect  of Japanese.   The vast majority of loanwords other than Sino-Korean come from modern times, 90% of which are from  English . [ 8 ]  Many words have also been borrowed from  Japanese  and  Western languages  such as  German  ( areubaiteu  part-time job,  allereugi  allergy). Some Western words were borrowed indirectly via Japanese, taking a Japanese sound pattern, for example dozen >     dsu  >     daseu . Most indirect Western borrowings are now written according to current Hangulization rules for the respective Western language, as if borrowed directly. There are a few more complicated borrowings such as German(y) (see  Names for Germany ), the first part of whose  endonym   [d.lant]  the Japanese approximated using the  kanji      doitsu  that were then accepted into the Korean language by their Sino-Korean pronunciation:     dok  +     il  =  Dogil . In South Korean official use, a number of other Sino-Korean country names have been replaced with phonetically oriented Hangulizations of the countries' endonyms or English names.   North Korean vocabulary shows a tendency to prefer native Korean over Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings, especially with recent political objectives aimed at eliminating foreign (mostly Chinese) influences on the Korean language in the North. By contrast, South Korean may have several Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings which tend to be absent in North Korean.     [ edit ]   Writing system       Korean writing systems           Hangul       Hanja       Hyangchal   Gugyeol   Idu       Mixed script       Korean romanization       Revised Romanization of Korean   McCune-Reischauer   Yale Romanization           Main article:  Hangul   See also:  Hangul consonant and vowel tables   In ancient times, the languages of the Korean peninsula were written using  Chinese characters , using  hyangchal  or  idu . Such systems were not popular because hanja is not well suited to the Korean language. Its use is now limited.   Korean is now mainly written in Hangul, the Korean alphabet promulgated in 1446 by  Sejong the Great ;  hanja may be mixed in  to write  Sino-Korean words . South Korea still teaches 1800 hanja characters in its schools, while the North abolished the use of hanja decades ago.

Korean  punctuation  marks are almost identical to Western ones. Traditionally, Korean was written in columns from top to bottom, right to left, but is now usually written in rows from left to right, top to bottom.     [ edit ]   Differences between North Korean and South Korean   Main article:  Korean language North-South differences   The Korean language used in the North and the South exhibits differences in pronunciation, spelling, grammar and vocabulary. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Pronunciation   In North Korea,  palatalization  of  /si/  is optional, and  //  can be pronounced as  [z]  in between vowels.   Words that are written the same way may be pronounced differently, such as the examples below. The pronunciations below are given in  Revised Romanization ,  McCune-Reischauer  and Hangul, the last of which represents what the Hangul would be if one writes the word as pronounced.

(In the South, this rule only applies when it is attached to any single-character Sino-Korean word.)     [ edit ]   Spelling   Some words are spelled differently by the North and the South, but the pronunciations are the same.

[ edit ]   Spelling and pronunciation   Some words have different spellings and pronunciations in the North and the South, some of which were given in the ""Phonology"" section above:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          ryeongryang (ryngryang)      yeongnyang (yngnyang)   strength   Korean words originally starting in  r  or  n  have their  r  or  n  dropped in the South Korean version if the sound following it is an  i  or  y  sound.          rodong (rodong)      nodong (nodong)   work   Korean words originally starting in  r  have their  r  changed to  n  in the South Korean version if the sound following it is a sound other than  i  or  y .          wonssu (wnssu)      wonsu (wnsu)   mortal enemy   ""Mortal enemy"" and ""head of state"" are homophones in the South. Possibly to avoid referring to  Kim Il-sung  /  Kim Jong-il  as the enemy, the second syllable of ""enemy"" is written and pronounced  in the North.          rajio (rajio)      radio (radio)   radio            u (u)      wi (wi)   on; above            anhae (anhae)      anae (anae)   wife            kkuba (kkuba)      kuba (k'uba)   Cuba   When transcribing foreign words from languages that do not have contrasts between aspirated and unaspirated stops, North Koreans generally use tensed stops for the unaspirated ones while South Koreans use aspirated stops in both cases.          pe (p'e)      pye (p'ye), pe (p'e)   lungs   All hanja pronounced as  pye  ( p'ye ) or  pe  ( p'e ) in the South are pronounced as  pe  ( p'e ) in the North. The spelling is also accordingly different.       In general, when transcribing place names, North Korea tends to use the pronunciation in the original language more than South Korea, which often uses the pronunciation in English.

[ edit ]   Study by non-native speakers   The  United States '  Defense Language Institute  classifies Korean alongside  Arabic ,  Chinese , and  Japanese  as a Category IV language, meaning that 63 weeks of instruction (as compared to just 25 weeks for  French ,  Spanish ,  Portuguese , and  Italian ) are required to bring an English-speaking student to a limited working level of proficiency in which he or she has ""sufficient capability to meet routine social demands and limited job requirements"" and ""can deal with concrete topics in past, present, and future tense."" [ 10 ]  As a result, the study of the Korean language in the United States is dominated by  Korean American  heritage language students; they are estimated to form over 80% of all students of the language at non-military universities. [ 11 ]   However, Korean is considerably easier for speakers of certain other languages, such as Japanese, Mongolian and Turkic languages; in Japan, it is more widely studied by non-heritage learners.

This language has its own  Wikipedia  Project. You can visit and contribute at the  Korean language Wikipedia .     The  Korean language  is the most widely used language in  Korea , and is the official language of both  South  and  North  Korea.  The language is also spoken widely in neighbouring  Yanbian ,  China .  Worldwide, there are around 78 million Korean speakers, including large groups in the former  Soviet Union , the  United States ,  Canada ,  Brazil  and  Japan . Proper  classification  of Korean is not universally agreed on, but it is often considered by many to be a  language isolate . Some linguists instead group it in the  Altaic  family of languages.  The native Korean writing system—called  Hangul —is  syllabic  and phonetic.   Sino-Korean  characters ( Hanja ) are also used in writing.  While the most commonly used words in the language are of native Korean origin, well over 50% of the language's vocabulary consists of words composed from  Hanja .  Korean is  agglutinative  in its word formation and  SOV  in its syntax.

The Korean names for the language are based on the  names for Korea  used in South and North Korea.    In South Korea, Korea is called ""Hanguk"" (In  Hangul : 한국).  There and outside of Korea, the language is most often called ""Hangungmal"" (한국말), or more formally, ""Hangugeo"" (한국어).  The language is also sometimes referred to colloquially as ""Urimal"" (우리말; ""our language"").  The standard language taught in schools is often referred to as ""Gugeo"" (국어; ""national language"").  In North Korea, Korea is called ""Chosŏn"" (조선), and the language is most often called ""Chosŏnmal"" (조선말) or more formally, ""Chosŏnŏ"" (조선어).  Korea was also called ""Chosŏn"" (""Chosen"" in  Japanese ) during the  Japanese Colonial Period  ( 1910 - 1945 ), and so many important linguistic works written during that period also refer to the language by the names ""Chosŏnŏ"" or ""Chosŏnmal.""    History   The native written script,  Hangul , was devised in 1446, under the decree of  King Sejong .   Hanja  has also been used extensively since the early first millennium, mainly to represent  Sino-Korean  words, but also in the period before the introduction of Hangul, to represent words of native Korean origin.    Classification and related languages   Korean is often classified as being a separate language in a family of its own (a  language isolate ). In addition, most Korean and some Western linguists recognize Korean's kinship to the  Altaic languages . On the other hand, traditional Western (since the 18th century) and many Japanese linguists believe that Korea has a linguistic relationship with  Japanese .  In Korea, the possibility of Korean-Japanese linguistic relationship has been ignored mostly; the often strained relations between the two countries throughout history tend to make any discussion of a relationship between their languages a controversial one. However, the Korean relationship with  Altaic  and proto-Altaic also have been much argued as of late. It does bear some  morphological  resemblance to some languages of the Eastern Turkic group, namely,  Yakut  and some of its variants, and some linguists believe that Altaic itself forms part of a larger  Ural-Altaic  language family. The opponents of this view believe that much of the  Altaic  influences in the language was infused later in Korean history during the Mongol rule over Korea during the  Goryeo  dynasty.    Geographic distribution   Dialects   Main article:  Dialects of Korean   (under construction)   Korean has several  dialects  (called  mal  (literally speech),  bang-eon , or  saturi  in Korean). The  standard language  ( Pyojuneo  or  Pyojunmal ) of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  P'yŏngyang . These dialects are similar, and in fact all dialects except that of  Jeju  Island are largely mutually intelligible. The dialect spoken there is classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of Seoul Dialect use stress very little, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of Gyeongsang Dialect have a very pronounced intonation that makes their dialect sound more like a European language to western ears.  There is a very close connection between the dialects of Korean and the  regions of Korea , since the boundaries of both are largely determined by mountains and seas.  Here is a list of traditional dialect names and locations:            Standard Dialect     Where Used        Seoul    Seoul ,  Incheon ,  Gyeonggi  ( South Korea );  Kaesŏng  ( North Korea )       P'yŏngan    P'yŏngyang ,  P'yŏngan  region,  Chagang  (North Korea)        Regional Dialect     Where Used        Chungcheong    Daejeon ,  Chungcheong  region (South Korea)       Gangwon    Gangwon  (South Korea)/ Kangwŏn  (North Korea)       Gyeongsang    Busan ,  Daegu ,  Ulsan ,  Gyeongsang  region (South Korea)       Hamgyŏng    Rasŏn , Hamgyŏng region,  Ryanggang  (North Korea)       Hwanghae    Hwanghae  region (North Korea)       Jeju    Jeju  Island/Province (South Korea)       Jeolla    Gwangju ,  Jeolla  region (South Korea)        Sounds   Consonants             Bilabial  Alveolar  Palatal  Velar  Glottal      Stop  plain   p   t   c   k         tensed   p’   t’   c’   k’         aspirated   p h    t h    c h    k h         Fricative   plain     s       h       tensed     s’            Nasal   m   n     ŋ        Lateral approximant     l          Example words for consonants:           phoneme     IPA     Romanized     English           p     pal     bal     'foot'           p’     p’al     ppal     'sucking'            p h     p h al     pal     'arm'           m     mal     mal     'horse'           t     tal     dal     'moon'           t’     t’al     ttal     'daughter'            t h     t h al     tal     'riding'           n     nal     nal     'day'           c     cal     jal     'well'           c’     c’al     jjal     'squeezing'            c h     c h al     chal     'kicking'           k     kal     gal     'going'           k’     k’al     kkal     'spreading'            k h     k h al     kal     'knife'           ŋ     paŋ     bang     'room'           s     sal     sal     'flesh'           s’     s’al     ssal     'rice'            l     palam     baram     'wind'           h     hal     hal     'doing'        [c], [cʰ], and [c'] have more frication than the other stops and are sometimes described as affricates.   The symbol [’] is used to denote the tensed consonants ([p’], [t’], [c’], [k’], and [s’]) but its official  IPA  usage is for  ejective  consonants, which the tensed stops in Korean are not. The tensed stops are produced with a partially constricted  glottis  and additional subglottal pressure.    Vowels       Monophthongs   Korean has 8 different vowel qualities and a length distinction. The close-mid front rounded vowel [ø] can still be heard in the speech of some older speakers, but it has largely been replaced by the diphthong [we]. Similarly, the length distinction for all vowels can still be heard from older speakers, but it is no longer made by most younger speakers.           i     siˈɟaŋ     sijang     'hunger'     iː     ˈsiːɟaŋ     sijang     'market'           e     peˈɡɛ     begae     'pillow'     eː     ˈpeːda     beda     'to cut'           ɛ     tʰɛˈjaŋ     taeyang     'sun'     ɛː     ˈtʰɛːdo     taedo     'attitude'           a     ˈmal     mal     'horse'     aː     ˈmaːl     mal     'speech'           o     poˈli     bori     'barley'     oː     ˈpoːsu     bosu     'salary'           u     kuˈli     guri     'copper'     uː     ˈsuːbak     subak     'watermelon'           ʌ     ˈpʌl     beol     'punishment'     ʌː     ˈpʌːl     beol     'bee'           ɯ     ˈʌːlɯn     eoreun     'seniors'     ɯː     ˈɯːmsik     eumsik     'food'         Diphthongs and glides   [j] and [w] are considered to be components of diphthongs rather than separate consonant phonemes.                         wi dwi dwi 'back'         ɯi' ˈɯisa uiza 'doctor'      je ˈjeːsan yesan 'budget'         we kwe gwe 'box'                      jɛ ˈjɛːki yaegi 'story'         wɛ wɛ wae 'why'                      ja ˈjaːgu yagu 'baseball'         wa kwaːˈil kwa-il 'fruits'                      jo ˈkjoːs’a gyosa 'teacher'                                      ju juˈli yuri 'glass'                                      jʌ jʌːgi yeogi 'here'         wʌ mwʌ mwo 'what'                     Source:  Handbook of the International Phonetic Association     Phonology   [s] becomes palatalized as [ʃ] or [ɕ] before [j] or [i].  [h] becomes labialized [ɸ] before [o] and [u] and palatalized [ç] before [i] or [j]  [p], [t], [c], and [k] become voiced [b], [d], [ɟ], and [ɡ] between  sonorant  segments.  [l] becomes alveolar flap [ɾ] between  sonorant  segments, such as between two  vowels .  Phonetic rules, mostly  assimilation , transform the pronunciation of some words. For example,       Jong l o  is pronounced as  Jong n o     Han k u k mal  as  Han- g u ng mal     Stop consonants are generally voiceless, but lightly aspirated stops become voiced and unaspirated in intervocalic position. For example,     p -> b   t -> d   k -> g    Stops are nasalized before a nasal. For example,     p -> m (before m, n, or ng)   t -> n (before m, n, or ng)   k -> ng (before m, n, or ng)    Hangul  spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying  morphology .  One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial [r]. For example,     勞動 north:  r odong , south:  n odong  (labour)   鴨綠江 north:  Am r okgang , south:  Am n okgang  (name of a River)   心理學 north:  shim r ihak , south:  shim n ihak  (psychology)    Vowel harmony   Traditionally, the Korean language has had strong  vowel harmony . It is not as prevalent in modern usage however, although it remains strong in  onomatopoeia ,  adjectives , and  adverbs .    Grammar   Korean is an  agglutinative language . The basic form of a Korean sentence is Subject-Object-Verb ( SOV ), and modifiers precede the modified word. Accordingly, whereas in English, one would say, ""I'm going to the store to buy some food,” in Korean it would be: *""I food to-buy in-order-to store-to going-am.""  In Korean, ""unnecessary"" words (see  theme and rheme ) can be left out of a sentence as long as the context makes the meaning clear. A typical exchange might translate word-for word to the following:    H: ""가게에 가세요?"" ( gage-e gaseyo? )  G: ""예."" ( ye. )      H: *""store-to going?""  G: ""yes.""      which in English would translate to:    H: ""Are you going to the store?""  G: ""Yes.""      Unlike Romance languages, Korean does not conjugate verbs using agreement with the subject, and nouns have no gender. Instead, verb conjugations depend upon the verb tense and on the relation between the people speaking. When talking to or about friends, you would use one conjugate ending, to your parents, another, and to nobility/honoured persons, another. This loosely echoes the  T-V distinction  of most  Indo-European languages .     Speech Levels and Honorifics    The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean, and the grammar reflects this. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject is reflected in  honorifics , while that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in  speech level .    Honorifics   When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer to use special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older distant relative (grandparent's sibling, older sibling's spouse, etc.), a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a close relative (grandparent, parent, spouse, or sibling), younger stranger, student, employee or the like. On rare occasions (like when someone wants to pick a fight), a speaker might speak to a superior or stranger in a way normally only used for, say, animals, but no one would do this without seriously considering the consequences to their physical safety first!  One way of using honorifics is to use  special nouns  in place of regular nouns with ""honorific"" ones. A common example is using  jinji  instead of  bap  for ""food"". More often, special nouns are used when speaking about relatives. Thus, the speaker/writer may address his own grandmother as  halmeoni  but refer to someone else's grandmother as  halmeonim . (The  m  comes from the honorific suffix  -nim  (님), which is affixed to many kinship terms to make them honorific; thus,  hyeongnim  is the formal term for an older sibling of the same sex (derived from  hyeong,  the informal term for man's older brother;  eonni  is the informal term for a woman's older sister).  All verbs can be converted into an honorific form by adding the infix  -si-  (시, pronounced  shi ) after the  stem  and before the verb ending. Thus,  gada  (""go"") becomes  gasida . A few verbs have special honorific equivalents. Therefore  gyesida  is the honorific form of  itda  (""exist"");  japsusida  is the honorific form of  meokda  (""eat""); and  jumusida  is the honorific form of  jada  (""sleep"").  A few verbs have special humble forms, used when the speaker is referring to him/herself in polite situations. These include  deurida  and  ollida  for  juda  (""give"").  Deurida  is substituted for  juda  when the latter is used as an  auxiliary  verb, while  ollida --which literally means ""raise up""--is used for  juda  in the sense of ""offer"".  Pronouns in Korean have their own set of polite equivalents: thus,  jeo  is the humble form of  na  (""I"");  jeoheui  is the humble form of  uri  (""we""); and  dangsin  (""friend,"" but only used as a form of address and more polite than ""chingu"", the usual word for ""friend""; also, whereas uses of other humble forms are straightforward, ""dangsin"" must be used only in specific social contexts, such as between two married couple--""dangsin"" can often be used in ironic sense when used between strangers) is the honorific form of  neo  (""you"" (singular). Note: in general, Koreans avoid using second person singular pronoun, especially when using honorific forms, and either i) use the person's name or title in place of ""you"" in English, or ii) use plural ""ieoreobun"" where applicable).    Speech Levels   There are no fewer than 7 verb  paradigms  or  speech levels  in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation. Unlike  honorifics --which are used to show respect towards a subject-- speech levels  are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience. The names of the 7 levels are derived from the non-honorific  imperative  form of the verb  hada  (""do"") in each level, plus the suffix  che , which means ""body.""  The highest 5 levels use  final  verb endings, while the lowest 2 levels ( haeyoche ) and ( haeche ) use non-final endings and are called  banmal  (""half-words"") in Korean. (The  haeyoche  in turn is formed by simply adding the non-final ending  yo  (요) to the  haeche  form of the verb.)  Taken together, honorifics and speech levels form a  cartesian product  of 14 basic verb stems. Here is a table giving the 7 levels, the  present  indicative form of the verb  hada  (하다; ""do"" in English) in each level in both its honorific and non-honorific forms, and the situations in which each level is used.      Speech Level Non-Honorific Present Indicative of ""hada"" Honorific Present Indicative of ""hada"" Level of Formality When Used   Hasoseoche (하소서체) hanaida (하나이다) hashinaida (하시나이다) Extremely formal and polite Traditionally used when addressing a king, queen, or high official; now used only in historical dramas and the Bible   Hapshoche (합쇼체) hamnida (합니다) hashimnida (하십니다) Formal and polite Used commonly between strangers, among male co-workers, by TV announcers, and to customers   Haoche (하오체) hao (하오) hasho (하쇼), hashio (하시오) Formal, of neutral politeness Only used nowadays among some older people   Hageche (하게체) hane (하네) hashine (하시네) Formal, of neutral politeness Generally only used by some older people when addressing younger people, friends, or relatives   Haerache (해라체) handa (한다) hashinda (하신다) Formal, of neutral politeness or impolite Used to close friends, relatives of similar age, or younger people; also used almost universally in books, newspapers, and magazines; also used in reported speech (""She said that..."")   Haeyoche (해요체) haeyo (해요) haseyo (하세요) (common), hasheoyo (하셔요) (rare) Informal and polite Used mainly between strangers, especially those older or of equal age. Traditionally used more by women than men, though in  Seoul  many men prefer this form to the Hapshoche (see above).   Haeche (해체) hae (해) (in speech), hayeo (하여) (in writing) hasheo(하셔) Informal, of neutral politeness or impolite Used most often between close friends and relatives, and when addressing younger people. It is  never  used between strangers unless the speaker wants to pick a fight.     Vocabulary   The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words. More than 50% of the vocabulary, however, is made up of  Hanja  ( Sino-Korean ) words, which are derived from  Chinese characters . To a much lesser extent, words have also been borrowed from  Mongolian ,  Sanskrit , and other languages. In modern times, many words have also been borrowed from  Western languages  such as  German  and, more recently,  English .  The numbers are a good example of borrowing. Like  Japanese , Korean has two number systems—one native and one borrowed from the Chinese—so Korean, Chinese, Japanese, and some other languages such as  Thai  all appear to have similar words for numbers.    Writing system   Main article:  Hangul   The Korean language was originally written using "" Hanja "", or  Chinese characters ; it is now mainly written in  Hangul , the Korean alphabet, optionally mixing in Hanja to write  Sino-Korean  words. Hangul consists of 24 letters -- 14 consonants and 10 vowels that are written in blocks of 2 to 5 characters. Unlike the  Chinese  writing system (including  Japanese   Kanji ), Hangul is not an  ideographic  system. The shapes of the individual Hangul letters were designed to model the physical morphology of the tongue, palate and teeth; up to five letters join to form a syllabic unit.  Below is a chart of the Korean alphabet's symbols and their canonical  SAMPA  values:        Consonants       p   t    c   k           ᄇ   ᄃ   ᄌ   ᄀ           p’   t’   c’   k’           ᄈ   ᄄ   ᄍ   ᄁ           p h   t h   c h   k h           ᄑ   ᄐ   ᄎ   ᄏ               s       h               ᄉ       ᄒ               s’                       ᄊ                   m   n       N           ᄆ   ᄂ       ᄋ           w   r   j               (n/a)   ᄅ   (n/a)               Vowels       i   e   }   a   o   u   7   M            ᅵ   ᅦ   ᅢ   ᅡ   ᅩ   ᅮ   ᅥ   ᅳ            Mi   je   j}   ja   jo   ju   j7                ᅴ   ᅨ   ᅤ   ᅣ   ᅭ   ᅲ   ᅧ                ui   ue   o}   oa           u7                ᅱ   ᅰ   ᅫ   ᅪ           ᅯ                (See also:  Hangul consonant tables )  Modern Korean is written with  spaces  between  words , a feature not found in the other  CJK  languages (Chinese and Japanese). Korean  punctuation  marks are almost identical to Western ones. Traditionally, Korean was written in columns from top to bottom, right to left, much as in other East Asian cultures. Korean is still sometimes written in columns (especially in poetry), but is now usually written in rows from left to right, top to bottom.

There are about 78 million Korean speakers. It was formerly written using  Hanja , borrowed  Chinese characters  pronounced in the Korean way. In the 15th century a national writing system was developed by  Sejong the Great , nowadays called  Hangul .   The genealogical  classification  of the Korean language is debated.

In South Korea, the language is most often called  Hangungmal  (  ;   ), or more formally,  Hangugeo  (  ;   ) or  Gugeo  (  ;   ; literally ""national language"").   In North Korea and Yanbian in China, the language is most often called  Chosnmal  (  ; with  hanja :   ), or more formally,  Chosn  (  ;   ).   On the other hand, Korean people in the  former USSR , who refer to themselves as  Koryo-saram  (also  Goryeoin  [  ;   ; literally, "" Goryeo  person(s)""]) call the language  Goryeomal  (  ;   ).   In  mainland China , following the establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992, the term  Choxiny  (   or short form:  Choy  (  )) has normally been used to refer to the language spoken in North Korea and Yanbian, while  Hnguy  (   or short form:  Hny  (  )) is used to refer to the language spoken in South Korea.   Some older English sources also used the name ""Korean"" to refer to the language, country, and people.     [ edit ]   History   Main article:  History of the Korean language   Korean is descended from  Old Korean  and  Middle Korean .     [ edit ]   Classification   The classification of the modern Korean language is uncertain, and due to the lack of any one generally accepted theory, it is sometimes described conservatively as a  language isolate .   On the other hand, since the publication of the article of  Ramstedt  in 1926, many linguists support the hypothesis that Korean can be classified as an  Altaic  language, or as a relative of proto-Altaic. Korean is similar to Altaic languages in that they both lack certain grammatical elements, including  number ,  gender ,  articles , fusional morphology, voice, and  relative pronouns  (Kim Namkil). Korean especially bears some  morphological  resemblance to some languages of the Northern Turkic group, namely  Sakha (Yakut) . Vinokurova, a scholar of the Sakha language, noted that like in Korean, and unlike in other  Turkic languages  or a variety of other languages surveyed, adverbs in Sakha are derived from verbs with the help of derivational morphology; however, she did not suggest this implied any relation between the two languages. [ 2 ]   It is also considered likely that Korean is related in some way to  Japanese , since the two languages have nearly identical grammatical structures, and share a number of possible phonological cognates (though a majority of them are likely due to local pronunciations of the Chinese characters from which they are derived), as noted by such researchers as  Samuel E. Martin  and  Roy Andrew Miller  in the late 1960s.  Sergei Starostin  (1991) found about 25% of potential cognates in the Japanese-Korean 100-word  Swadesh list , which places these two languages closer together than other possible members of the Altaic family. [ 3 ]   Genetic relationships have been postulated both directly and indirectly, the latter either through placing both languages in the Altaic family, or by arguing for a relationship between Japanese and the  Buyeo languages  of  Goguryeo  and  Baekje  (see below); the proposed Baekje relationship is supported by cognates such as Baekje  mir , Japanese  mi-  ""three"". [ 4 ]   The possible relationship between Korean and Japanese can be exemplified by such basic vocabularly items as J.     mizu  (Old J.  midu ) : K.     mul  (Middle K.  mirh ) ""water"",  mot  ""lake""; J.     ku-ru  ""come"" (Old J.  ku , also cf. irregular root changes as in past tense   ki-ta , negative   ko-nai  in Modern J.) : K.     ka-da  (""go""); J.     kata-i  ""hard"" (whence     kata-na  ""knife, sword"") : K.  kud-yn  (hard); J.     i-ru  ""to be"" (past tense   i-ta ) : K.     i-da  ""to be""; J.  na ,  -en  : K.  anh  ""not"", J.  minna  (Old J.  mynna ) ""all, everyone"" : K.  manh-  ""many"" (predicate  mana-da ), etc.  [ 5 ] . The same possible cognates are often observed in other members of the potential  Altaic family , esp. in the  Tungusic languages . Cf. Nanay  mue  ""water"",  giagda-  ""to walk"",  anaa, anna  ""not"".   Others argue, however, that the similarities are not due to any genetic relationship, but rather to a  sprachbund  effect. [ citation needed ]  See  East Asian languages  for morphological features shared among languages of the East Asian  sprachbund , and  Classification of Japanese  for further details on the possible relationship. However, it is very difficult to argue that similarities in such key terms like ""water"" and the verbs ""to be"" ""to go"" would arise from sprachbund effects.   It is presumed that modern Korean may be more closely related to the languages of  Samhan  and  Silla  than the Buyeo languages; many Korean scholars believe they were mutually intelligible, and the collective basis of what in the  Goryeo  period would merge to become Middle Korean (the language before the changes that the  Seven-Year War  brought) and eventually Modern Korean. The  Jeju dialect  preserves some archaic features that can also be found in Middle Korean, whose  arae a  is retained in the dialect as a distinct vowel.   There are also more marginal hypotheses proposing various other relationships; for example, a few scholars, such as Homer B. Hulbert (1905), have tried to relate Korean to the  Dravidian languages  through the similar syntax in both. [ 6 ]   Though not related to Chinese, it has borrowed heavily; see the Vocabulary section below.     [ edit ]   Dialects   Main article:  Korean dialects          Dialects of Korean       Korean has several  dialects  (called  mal  [literally ""speech""],  saturi , or  bang-eon  in Korean). The  standard language  ( pyojuneo  or  pyojunmal ) of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  P'yngyang . All dialects of Korean are similar to each other, and are in fact all mutually intelligible, perhaps with the exception of the dialect of  Jeju Island  (see  Jeju dialect ). The dialect spoken in Jeju is in fact classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of  Seoul dialect  use very little stress, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of the  Gyeongsang dialect  have a very pronounced intonation.   It is also worth noting that there is substantial evidence for a history of extensive  dialect levelling , or even  convergent evolution  or intermixture of two or more originally distinct linguistic stocks, within the Korean language and its dialects. Many Korean dialects have basic vocabulary that is etymologically distinct from vocabulary of identical meaning in Standard Korean or other dialects, such as South Jeolla dialect /kur/ vs. Standard Korean     /ip/  ""mouth"" or Gyeongsang dialect  /.u.i/  vs. Standard Korean  /puu/  "" garlic chives ."" This suggests that the Korean Peninsula may have at one time been much more linguistically diverse than it is at present. See also the  Buyeo languages   hypothesis .   There is a very close connection between the dialects of Korean and the  regions of Korea , since the boundaries of both are largely determined by mountains and seas. Here is a list of traditional dialect names and locations:       Standard dialect   Where used       Seoul   Seoul  (),  Incheon  (/), most of  Gyeonggi  (/)       P'yngan  (/)   P'yngyang ,  P'yngan  region,  Chagang  (North Korea)       Regional dialect   Where used       Gyeonggi   limited areas of the  Gyeonggi  region (South Korea)       Chungcheong   Daejeon ,  Chungcheong  region (South Korea)       Gangwon   Gangwon-do (South Korea) / Kangwn (North Korea)       Gyeongsang   Busan ,  Daegu ,  Ulsan ,  Gyeongsang  region (South Korea)       Hamgyng   Rasn ,  Hamgyng  region,  Ryanggang  (North Korea)       Hwanghae   Hwanghae  region (North Korea)       Jeju   Jeju Island/Province  (South Korea)       Jeolla   Gwangju ,  Jeolla  region (South Korea)         [ edit ]   Phonology       This article contains  IPA  phonetic symbols.

Its official use in the  Extensions to the IPA  is for  'strong'  articulation, but is used in the literature for  faucalized voice . The Korean consonants also have elements of  stiff voice , but it is not yet known how typical this is of faucalized consonants. They are produced with a partially constricted  glottis  and additional subglottal pressure in addition to tense vocal tract walls, laryngeal lowering, or other expansion of the larynx.     [ edit ]   Vowels                    The Korean basic vowels                 Monophthongs   /i/    ,  /e/    ,  //    ,  /a/    ,  /o/    ,  /u/    ,  //    ,  //    ,  //          Vowels preceded by intermediaries,  or Diphthongs   /je/    ,  /j/    ,  /ja/    ,  /wi/    ,  /we/    ,  /w/    ,  /wa/    ,  /i/    ,  /jo/    ,  /ju/    ,  /j/    ,  /w/            [ edit ]   Allophones   /s/  becomes an  alveolo-palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i]  for most speakers (but see  Differences in the language between North Korea and South Korea ). This occurs with the tense fricative and all the affricates as well. At the end of a syllable, /s/ changes to /t/ (Example: beoseot () 'mushroom').   /h/  may become a  bilabial   []  before  [o]  or  [u] , a  palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i] , a  velar   [x]  before  [] , a voiced  []  between voiced sounds, and a  [h]  elsewhere. [ citation needed ]   /p, t, , k/  become voiced  [b, d, , ]  between voiced sounds.   /l/  becomes alveolar flap  []  between vowels, and  [l]  or  []  at the end of a syllable or next to another  /l/ . Note that a written syllable-final '', when followed by a vowel or a glide ( i.e. , when the next character starts with ''), migrates to the next syllable and thus becomes  [] .   Traditionally,  /l/  was disallowed at the beginning of a word. It disappeared before  [j] , and otherwise became  /n/ . However, the inflow of western loanword changed the trend, and now word-initial  /l/  (mostly from English loanwords) are pronounced as a free variation of either  []  or  [l] . The traditional prohibition of word-initial  /l/  became a morphological rule called ""initial law"" () in South Korea, which pertains to Sino-Korean vocabulary. Such words retain their word-initial  /l/  in North Korea.   All  obstruents  (plosives, affricates, fricatives) are  unreleased   [p, t, k]  at the end of a word.   Plosive stops  /p, t, k/  become nasal stops  [m, n, ]  before nasal stops.   Hangul  spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying, partly historical  morphology . Given this, it is sometimes hard to tell which actual phonemes are present in a certain word.   One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial  [r] , and initial  [n] . For example,     ""labour"" - north:  r odong  (), south:  n odong  ()   ""history"" - north:  ry ksa  (), south:  y eoksa  ()   ""female"" - north:  ny ja  (), south:  y eoja  ()       [ edit ]   Morphophonemics   Grammatical morphemes may change shape depending on the preceding sounds. Examples include  -eun/-neun  (-/-) and  -i/-ga  (-/-). Sometimes sounds may be inserted instead. Examples include  -eul/-reul  (-/-),  -euro/-ro  (-/-),  -eseo/-seo  (-/-),  -ideunji/-deunji  (-/-) and  -iya/-ya  (-/-). However,  -euro/-ro  is somewhat irregular, since it will behave differently after a rieul consonant.     Korean particles     After a consonant   After a rieul   After a vowel       -ui  (-)       -eun  (-)   -neun  (-)       -i  (-)   -ga  (-)       -eul  (-)   -reul  (-)       -gwa  (-)   -wa  (-)       -euro  (-)   -ro  (-)       Some verbs may also change shape morphophonemically.     [ edit ]   Grammar   Main article:  Korean grammar     [ edit ]   Sentence structure   Korean is an  agglutinative language . Modifiers generally precede the modified words, and in the case of verb modifiers, can be serially appended. The basic form of a Korean sentence is  Subject Object Verb , but the verb is the only required and immovable element.       A :       -       -? (?)           kage-e     kasseo-yo           store + [location marker ()]     [go (verb root) ()]+[conjunctive ()]+[past ()]+[conjunctive ()]+ [polite marker ()]         ""Did [you] go to the store?"" (with ""you"" implied by context)         B :       .           ye           yes         ""Yes.""       [ edit ]   Parts of speech     [ edit ]   Verb   Korean  verbs  (  ,  tongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""action verbs"" or ""dynamic verbs"" to distinguish them from [  () ,  hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""]), which are also known as ""descriptive verbs"" or ""stative verbs"". Examples of action/dynamic verbs include    ( hada , ""to do"") and    ( kada , ""to go"") which constitute an action or movement as opposed to descriptive verbs such as    ( yehppeuda , ""to be beautiful""). For a larger list of Korean verbs, see  wikt:Category:Korean verbs .   Unlike most of the European languages, Korean does not conjugate verbs using agreement with the subject, and nouns have no gender. Instead, verb conjugations depend upon the verb tense, aspect, mood, and the social relation between the speaker, the subjects, and the listeners. The system of speech levels and honorifics loosely resembles the  T-V distinction  of most  Indo-European languages . For example, different endings are used based on the speaker's relation with the person they are talking to or the person about which they are talking. Politeness is a critical part of Korean language and Korean culture, therefore, when talking to someone esteemed, the correct verb ending, which should have a lot of respect, must be chosen.     [ edit ]   Adjective   Words categorized as Korean  adjectives  (  ,  hyeong-yongsa ,   ) conjugate similarly to verbs, so some English texts call them ""descriptive verbs"" or "" stative verbs "", but they are distinctly separate from    ( tongsa ).   English does not have an identical grammatical category, so the English translation of Korean adjectives may misleadingly suggest that they are verbs. For example,    ( pukda ) translates literally as ""to be red"" and    ( aswipda ) often best translates as ""to lack"" or ""to want for"", but both are    ( hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""). For a larger list of Korean adjectives, see  wikt:Category:Korean adjectives .     [ edit ]   Determiner   Korean  determiners  (  ,  gwanhyeongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""determinatives"", ""adnominals"", ""pre-nouns"", ""attributives"", and ""unconjugated adjectives"". Examples include    ( kak , ""each""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean determiners .     [ edit ]   Noun   A large body of Korean  nouns  (  ,  myeongsa ,   ) stem from  Chinese characters , e.g.    (,  san , mountain),    (,  yeok , station),    (,  munhwa , culture), etc. Others are native to the Korean language, e.g.    ( nara , country),    ( nal , day). Many  Sino-Korean words  have a native Korean equivalent and vice versa, but not always. Nouns do not have  grammatical gender  and can be made  plural  by adding  to the end of the word, however in most instances the  singular  form is used even when in English it would be translated as plural. For example, while in English the sentence  ""there are three apples""  would use the plural  ""apples""  instead of the singular  ""apple"" , the Korean sentence    ( sagwa segae isssumnida ) maintains the word  ( sagwa , ""apple"") in its singular form, thus rendered in English as ""apple three(things) exist."" For a list of Korean nouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean nouns .     [ edit ]   Pronoun   Main article:  Korean pronouns   Korean  pronouns  (  ,  daemyeongsa ,   ) are highly influenced by the honorifics in the language. Pronouns change forms depending on the social status of the person or persons spoken to, e.g. the pronoun for ""I"" there is both the informal    ( na ) and the honorific/humble    ( jeo ). In general second person singular pronouns are avoided, especially when using honorific forms. For a larger list or Korean pronouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean pronouns .     [ edit ]   Adverb   Korean  adverbs  (  ,  busa ,   ) include    ( tto , ""also"") and    ( gadeuk , ""fully""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean adverbs .     [ edit ]   Particle   Korean  particles  (  ,  josa ,   ) are also known in English as "" postpositions "". Examples include    ( neun , topic marker) and    ( reul , object marker). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean particles .     [ edit ]   Interjection   Korean  interjections  (  ,  gamtansa ,   ) are also known in English as ""exclamations"". Examples include    ( ani , ""no""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean interjections .     [ edit ]   Number   Main article:  Korean numerals   Korean  numbers  or numerals (  ,  susa ,   ) consitute two regularly used sets: a native Korean set and a  Sino-Korean  set. The Sino-Korean system is nearly entirely based on the  Chinese numerals . The distinction between the two numeral systems is very important. Everything that can be counted will use one of the two systems, but seldom both. Sino-Korean words are sometimes used to mark ordinal usage: yeol beon ( ) means ""ten times"" while sip beon (() ()) means ""number ten."" The grouping of large numbers in Korean follow the Chinese tradition of myriads (10000) rather than thousands (1000) as is common in Europe and North America.     [ edit ]   Speech levels and honorifics   Main article:  Korean honorifics   The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean, and the grammar reflects this. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject referent is reflected in  honorifics , while that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in  speech level .     [ edit ]   Honorifics   When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a younger stranger, student, employee or the like. Nowadays, there are special endings which can be used on declarative, interrogative, and imperative sentences; and both honorific or normal sentences. They are made for easier and faster use of Korean.     [ edit ]   Speech levels   There are seven verb  paradigms  or  speech levels  in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation. [ citation needed ]  Unlike  honorifics   which are used to show respect towards the referent   speech levels  are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience. The names of the 7 levels are derived from the non-honorific  imperative  form of the verb    ( hada , ""do"") in each level, plus the suffix  ('che',  hanja :   ), which means ""style.""   The highest 6 levels are generally grouped together as  jondaenmal  (), while the lowest level ( haeche , ) is called  banmal  () in Korean.     [ edit ]   Vocabulary   The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words. Like Japanese and Vietnamese, more than 50% of the vocabulary (up to 60% by some estimates), especially words that denote abstract ideas, are  Sino-Korean words , [ 7 ]  either     directly borrowed from  Written Chinese , or   coined in Japan or Korea using  Chinese characters ,     in a similar way European languages borrow from Latin and Greek. Korean has two  number systems : one native, and one borrowed from Chinese.   To a much lesser extent, words have also occasionally been borrowed from  Mongolian ,  Sanskrit , and other languages. Conversely, the Korean language itself has also contributed some loanwords to other languages, most notably the  Tsushima dialect  of Japanese.   The vast majority of loanwords other than Sino-Korean come from modern times, 90% of which are from  English . [ 8 ]  Many words have also been borrowed from  Japanese  and  Western languages  such as  German  ( areubaiteu  part-time job,  allereugi  allergy). Some Western words were borrowed indirectly via Japanese, taking a Japanese sound pattern, for example dozen >     dsu  >     daseu . Most indirect Western borrowings are now written according to current Hangulization rules for the respective Western language, as if borrowed directly. There are a few more complicated borrowings such as German(y) (see  Names for Germany ), the first part of whose  endonym   [d.lant]  the Japanese approximated using the  kanji      doitsu  that were then accepted into the Korean language by their Sino-Korean pronunciation:     dok  +     il  =  Dogil . In South Korean official use, a number of other Sino-Korean country names have been replaced with phonetically oriented Hangulizations of the countries' endonyms or English names.   North Korean vocabulary shows a tendency to prefer native Korean over Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings, especially with recent political objectives aimed at eliminating foreign (mostly Chinese) influences on the Korean language in the North. By contrast, South Korean may have several Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings which tend to be absent in North Korean.     [ edit ]   Writing system       Korean writing systems           Hangul       Hanja       Hyangchal   Gugyeol   Idu       Mixed script       Korean romanization       Revised Romanization of Korean   McCune-Reischauer   Yale Romanization           Main article:  Hangul   See also:  Hangul consonant and vowel tables   In ancient times, the languages of the Korean peninsula were written using  Chinese characters , using  hyangchal  or  idu . Such systems were not popular because hanja is not well suited to the Korean language. Its use is now limited.   Korean is now mainly written in Hangul, the Korean alphabet promulgated in 1446 by  Sejong the Great ;  hanja may be mixed in  to write  Sino-Korean words . South Korea still teaches 1800 hanja characters in its schools, while the North abolished the use of hanja decades ago.   Below is a chart of the Korean alphabet's symbols and their canonical  IPA  values:     Consonants     Hangul                                                                        RR   b , p   d , t   j   g , k   pp   tt   jj   kk   p   t   ch   k   s   h   ss   m   n   ng       r , l           IPA   p   t      k   p   t      k   p   t      k   s   h   s   m   n      w   r   j         Vowels     Hangul                                                                      RR   i   e   oe   ae   a   o   u   eo   eu   ui   ye   yae   ya   yo   yu   yeo   wi   we   wae   wa   wo       IPA   i   e         a   o   u         i   je   j   ja   jo   ju   j   wi   we   w   wa   w       Modern Korean is written with  spaces  between  words , a feature not found in Chinese or Japanese. Korean  punctuation  marks are almost identical to Western ones. Traditionally, Korean was written in columns from top to bottom, right to left, but is now usually written in rows from left to right, top to bottom.     [ edit ]   Differences between North Korean and South Korean   Main article:  Korean language North-South differences   The Korean language used in the North and the South exhibits differences in pronunciation, spelling, grammar and vocabulary. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Pronunciation   In North Korea,  palatalization  of  /si/  is optional, and  //  can be pronounced as  [z]  in between vowels.   Words that are written the same way may be pronounced differently, such as the examples below. The pronunciations below are given in  Revised Romanization ,  McCune-Reischauer  and Hangul, the last of which represents what the Hangul would be if one writes the word as pronounced.       Word   Meaning   Pronunciation       North (RR/MR)   North (Hangul)   South (RR/MR)   South (Hangul)          wide   neo p tta (n p ta)      neo l tta (n l ta)             to read  (continuative form)   i l kko (i l ko)      i l kko (i l ko)             Amnok River   am r okgang (am r okkang)      am n okkang (am n okkang)             independence   dong r ip (tong r ip)      dong n ip (tong n ip)             idea / sense / conception   gwa ll yeom (kwa ll ym)      gwa nn yeom (kwa nn ym)          *   innovative   hyeoksin jj eok (hyksin tch k)      hyeoksin j eok (hyksin j k)          * Similar pronunciation is used in the North whenever the hanja """" is attached to a Sino-Korean word ending in ,  or . (In the South, this rule only applies when it is attached to any single-character Sino-Korean word.)     [ edit ]   Spelling   Some words are spelled differently by the North and the South, but the pronunciations are the same.       Word spelling   Meaning   Pronunciation (RR/MR)   Remarks       North   South             sunshine   haeppit (haepit)   The ""sai siot"" ('' used for indicating sound change) is almost never written out in the North.             cherry blossom   beotkkot (ptkkot)                cannot read   monnikda (monnikta)   Spacing.             Hallasan   hallasan (hallasan)   When a - combination is pronounced as  ll , the original Hangul spelling is kept in the North, while the Hangul is changed in the South.             rules   gyuyul (kyuyul)   In words where the original hanja is spelt """" or """" and follows a vowel, the initial  is not pronounced in the North, making the pronunciation identical with that in the South where the  is dropped in the spelling.         [ edit ]   Spelling and pronunciation   Some words have different spellings and pronunciations in the North and the South, some of which were given in the ""Phonology"" section above:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          ryeongryang (ryngryang)      yeongnyang (yngnyang)   strength   Korean words originally starting in  r  or  n  have their  r  or  n  dropped in the South Korean version if the sound following it is an  i  or  y  sound.          rodong (rodong)      nodong (nodong)   work   Korean words originally starting in  r  have their  r  changed to  n  in the South Korean version if the sound following it is a sound other than  i  or  y .          wonssu (wnssu)      wonsu (wnsu)   mortal enemy   ""Mortal enemy"" and ""head of state"" are homophones in the South. Possibly to avoid referring to  Kim Il-sung  /  Kim Jong-il  as the enemy, the second syllable of ""enemy"" is written and pronounced  in the North.          rajio (rajio)      radio (radio)   radio            u (u)      wi (wi)   on; above            anhae (anhae)      anae (anae)   wife            kkuba (kkuba)      kuba (k'uba)   Cuba   When transcribing foreign words from languages that do not have contrasts between aspirated and unaspirated stops, North Koreans generally use tensed stops for the unaspirated ones while South Koreans use aspirated stops in both cases.          pe (p'e)      pye (p'ye), pe (p'e)   lungs   All hanja pronounced as  pye  ( p'ye ) or  pe  ( p'e ) in the South are pronounced as  pe  ( p'e ) in the North. The spelling is also accordingly different.       In general, when transcribing place names, North Korea tends to use the pronunciation in the original language more than South Korea, which often uses the pronunciation in English. For example:       Original name   North Korea transliteration   English name   South Korea transliteration       Spelling   Pronunciation   Spelling   Pronunciaton       Ulaanbaatar      ullanbattareu (ullanbattar)   Ulan Bator      ullanbatoreu (ullanbat'or)       Kbenhavn      koeppenhabeun (k'oeppenhabn)   Copenhagen      kopenhagen (k'op'enhagen)       al-Qhirah      kkahira (kkahira)   Cairo      kairo (k'airo)         [ edit ]   Grammar   Some grammatical constructions are also different:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.

Although the Hangul differ, the pronunciations are the same (i.e. with the tensed  sound).         [ edit ]   Vocabulary   Some vocabulary is different between the North and the South:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          munhwajutaek (munhwajut'aek)      apateu (ap'at')   Apartment     (appateu/appat') is also used in the North.          joseonmal (chosnmal)      han-gugeo(han'gugeo)   Korean language            gwakbap (kwakpap)      dosirak (tosirak)   lunch box           [ edit ]   Others   In the North,  guillemets     and    are the symbols used for quotes; in the South, quotation marks equivalent to the English ones,  and , are standard, although     and     are sometimes used in popular novels.     [ edit ]   Study by non-native speakers   The  United States '  Defense Language Institute  classifies Korean alongside  Arabic ,  Chinese , and  Japanese  as a Category IV language, meaning that 63 weeks of instruction (as compared to just 25 weeks for  French ,  Spanish ,  Portuguese , and  Italian ) are required to bring an English-speaking student to a limited working level of proficiency in which he or she has ""sufficient capability to meet routine social demands and limited job requirements"" and ""can deal with concrete topics in past, present, and future tense."" [ 10 ]  As a result, the study of the Korean language in the United States is dominated by  Korean American  heritage language students; they are estimated to form over 80% of all students of the language at non-military universities. [ 11 ]   However, Korean is considerably easier for speakers of certain other languages, such as Japanese, Mongolian and Turkic languages; in Japan, it is more widely studied by non-heritage learners. [ 12 ]  The  Korean Language Proficiency Test , an examination aimed at assessing non-native speakers' competence in Korean, was instituted in 1997; 17,000 people applied for the 2005 sitting of the examination.

Korean  (  /  , see  below ) is the official  language  of  North Korea  and  South Korea . It is also one of the two official languages in the  Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture  in  China . There are about 78 million Korean speakers. It was formerly written using  Hanja , borrowed  Chinese characters  pronounced in the Korean way. In the 15th century a national writing system was developed by  Sejong the Great , currently called  Hangul .   The genealogical  classification  of the Korean language is debated. Some linguists place it in the  Altaic  language family, while others consider it to be a  language isolate . It is  agglutinative  in its morphology and  SOV  in its  syntax .

In South Korea, the language is most often called  Hangungmal  (  ;   ), or more formally,  Hangugeo  (  ;   ) or  Gugeo  (  ;   ; literally ""national language"").   In North Korea and Yanbian in China, the language is most often called  Chosnmal  (  ; with  hanja :   ), or more formally,  Chosn  (  ;   ).   On the other hand, Korean people in the  former USSR , who refer to themselves as  Koryo-saram  (also  Goryeoin  [  ;   ; literally, "" Goryeo  person(s)""]) call the language  Goryeomal  (  ;   ).   In  mainland China , following the establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992, the term  Choxiny  (   or short form:  Choy  (  )) has normally been used to refer to the language spoken in North Korea and Yanbian, while  Hnguy  (   or short form:  Hny  (  )) is used to refer to the language spoken in South Korea.   Some older English sources also used the name ""Korean"" to refer to the language, country, and people.     [ edit ]   History   Main article:  History of the Korean language   Korean is descended from  Old Korean  and  Middle Korean .     [ edit ]   Classification   The classification of the modern Korean language is uncertain, and due to the lack of any one generally accepted theory, it is sometimes described conservatively as a  language isolate .   On the other hand, since the publication of the article of  Ramstedt  in 1926, many linguists support the hypothesis that Korean can be classified as an  Altaic  language, or as a relative of proto-Altaic. Korean is similar to Altaic languages in that they both lack certain grammatical elements, including  number ,  gender ,  articles , fusional morphology, voice, and  relative pronouns  (Kim Namkil). Korean especially bears some  morphological  resemblance to some languages of the Northern Turkic group, namely  Sakha (Yakut) . Vinokurova, a scholar of the Sakha language, noted that like in Korean, and unlike in other  Turkic languages  or a variety of other languages surveyed, adverbs in Sakha are derived from verbs with the help of derivational morphology; however, she did not suggest this implied any relation between the two languages. [ 2 ]   It is also considered likely that Korean is related in some way to  Japanese , since the two languages have nearly identical grammatical structures, and share a number of possible phonological cognates (though a majority of them are likely due to local pronunciations of the Chinese characters from which they are derived), as noted by such researchers as  Samuel E. Martin  and  Roy Andrew Miller  in the late 1960s.  Sergei Starostin  (1991) found about 25% of potential cognates in the Japanese-Korean 100-word  Swadesh list , which places these two languages closer together than other possible members of the Altaic family. [ 3 ]   Genetic relationships have been postulated both directly and indirectly, the latter either through placing both languages in the Altaic family, or by arguing for a relationship between Japanese and the  Buyeo languages  of  Goguryeo  and  Baekje  (see below); the proposed Baekje relationship is supported by cognates such as Baekje  mir , Japanese  mi-  ""three"". [ 4 ]   The possible relationship between Korean and Japanese can be exemplified by such basic vocabularly items as J.     mizu  (Old J.  midu ) : K.     mul  (Middle K.  mirh ) ""water"",  mot  ""lake""; J.     ku-ru  ""come"" (Old J.  ku , also cf. irregular root changes as in past tense   ki-ta , negative   ko-nai  in Modern J.) : K.     ka-da  (""go""); J.     kata-i  ""hard"" (whence     kata-na  ""knife, sword"") : K.  kud-yn  (hard); J.     i-ru  ""to be"" (past tense   i-ta ) : K.     i-da  ""to be""; J.  na ,  -en  : K.  anh  ""not"", J.  minna  (Old J.  mynna ) ""all, everyone"" : K.  manh-  ""many"" (predicate  mana-da ), etc.  [ 5 ] . The same possible cognates are often observed in other members of the potential  Altaic family , esp. in the  Tungusic languages . Cf. Nanay  mue  ""water"",  giagda-  ""to walk"",  anaa, anna  ""not"".   Others argue, however, that the similarities are not due to any genetic relationship, but rather to a  sprachbund  effect. [ citation needed ]  See  East Asian languages  for morphological features shared among languages of the East Asian  sprachbund , and  Classification of Japanese  for further details on the possible relationship. However, it is very difficult to argue that similarities in such key terms like ""water"" and the verbs ""to be"" ""to go"" would arise from sprachbund effects.   It is presumed that modern Korean may be more closely related to the languages of  Samhan  and  Silla  than the Buyeo languages; many Korean scholars believe they were mutually intelligible, and the collective basis of what in the  Goryeo  period would merge to become Middle Korean (the language before the changes that the  Seven-Year War  brought) and eventually Modern Korean. The  Jeju dialect  preserves some archaic features that can also be found in Middle Korean, whose  arae a  is retained in the dialect as a distinct vowel.   There are also more marginal hypotheses proposing various other relationships; for example, a few scholars, such as Homer B. Hulbert (1905), have tried to relate Korean to the  Dravidian languages  through the similar syntax in both. [ 6 ]   Though not related to Chinese, it has borrowed heavily; see the Vocabulary section below.     [ edit ]   Dialects   Main article:  Korean dialects          Dialects of Korean       Korean has several  dialects  (called  mal  [literally ""speech""],  saturi , or  bang-eon  in Korean). The  standard language  ( pyojuneo  or  pyojunmal ) of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  P'yngyang . All dialects of Korean are similar to each other, and are in fact all mutually intelligible, perhaps with the exception of the dialect of  Jeju Island  (see  Jeju dialect ). The dialect spoken in Jeju is in fact classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of  Seoul dialect  use very little stress, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of the  Gyeongsang dialect  have a very pronounced intonation.   It is also worth noting that there is substantial evidence for a history of extensive  dialect levelling , or even  convergent evolution  or intermixture of two or more originally distinct linguistic stocks, within the Korean language and its dialects. Many Korean dialects have basic vocabulary that is etymologically distinct from vocabulary of identical meaning in Standard Korean or other dialects, such as South Jeolla dialect /kur/ vs. Standard Korean     /ip/  ""mouth"" or Gyeongsang dialect  /.u.i/  vs. Standard Korean  /puu/  "" garlic chives ."" This suggests that the Korean Peninsula may have at one time been much more linguistically diverse than it is at present. See also the  Buyeo languages   hypothesis .   There is a very close connection between the dialects of Korean and the  regions of Korea , since the boundaries of both are largely determined by mountains and seas. Here is a list of traditional dialect names and locations:       Standard dialect   Where used       Seoul   Seoul  (),  Incheon  (/), most of  Gyeonggi  (/)       P'yngan  (/)   P'yngyang ,  P'yngan  region,  Chagang  (North Korea)       Regional dialect   Where used       Gyeonggi   limited areas of the  Gyeonggi  region (South Korea)       Chungcheong   Daejeon ,  Chungcheong  region (South Korea)       Gangwon   Gangwon-do (South Korea) / Kangwn (North Korea)       Gyeongsang   Busan ,  Daegu ,  Ulsan ,  Gyeongsang  region (South Korea)       Hamgyng   Rasn ,  Hamgyng  region,  Ryanggang  (North Korea)       Hwanghae   Hwanghae  region (North Korea)       Jeju   Jeju Island/Province  (South Korea)       Jeolla   Gwangju ,  Jeolla  region (South Korea)         [ edit ]   Phonology       This article contains  IPA  phonetic symbols.  Without proper  rendering support , you may see  question marks, boxes, or other symbols  instead of  Unicode  characters.       Main article:  Korean phonology     [ edit ]   Consonants          The Korean consonants             Bilabial   Alveolar   Post-  alveolar   Velar   Glottal       Nasal      /m/      /n/        //  (syllable-final)         Plosive  and   Affricate   plain      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         tense      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         aspirated      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         Fricative   plain        /s/          /h/       tense        /s/             Liquid        /l/           The  IPA  symbol <  > (a subscript double straight quotation mark, shown here with a placeholder circle) is used to denote the tensed consonants  /p/, /t/, /k/, //, /s/ . Its official use in the  Extensions to the IPA  is for  'strong'  articulation, but is used in the literature for  faucalized voice . The Korean consonants also have elements of  stiff voice , but it is not yet known how typical this is of faucalized consonants. They are produced with a partially constricted  glottis  and additional subglottal pressure in addition to tense vocal tract walls, laryngeal lowering, or other expansion of the larynx.     [ edit ]   Vowels                    The Korean basic vowels                 Monophthongs   /i/    ,  /e/    ,  //    ,  /a/    ,  /o/    ,  /u/    ,  //    ,  //    ,  //          Vowels preceded by intermediaries,  or Diphthongs   /je/    ,  /j/    ,  /ja/    ,  /wi/    ,  /we/    ,  /w/    ,  /wa/    ,  /i/    ,  /jo/    ,  /ju/    ,  /j/    ,  /w/            [ edit ]   Allophones   /s/  becomes an  alveolo-palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i]  for most speakers (but see  Differences in the language between North Korea and South Korea ). This occurs with the tense fricative and all the affricates as well. At the end of a syllable, /s/ changes to /t/ (Example: beoseot () 'mushroom').   /h/  may become a  bilabial   []  before  [o]  or  [u] , a  palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i] , a  velar   [x]  before  [] , a voiced  []  between voiced sounds, and a  [h]  elsewhere. [ citation needed ]   /p, t, , k/  become voiced  [b, d, , ]  between voiced sounds.   /l/  becomes alveolar flap  []  between vowels, and  [l]  or  []  at the end of a syllable or next to another  /l/ . Note that a written syllable-final '', when followed by a vowel or a glide ( i.e. , when the next character starts with ''), migrates to the next syllable and thus becomes  [] .   Traditionally,  /l/  was disallowed at the beginning of a word. It disappeared before  [j] , and otherwise became  /n/ . However, the inflow of western loanword changed the trend, and now word-initial  /l/  (mostly from English loanwords) are pronounced as a free variation of either  []  or  [l] . The traditional prohibition of word-initial  /l/  became a morphological rule called ""initial law"" () in South Korea, which pertains to Sino-Korean vocabulary. Such words retain their word-initial  /l/  in North Korea.   All  obstruents  (plosives, affricates, fricatives) are  unreleased   [p, t, k]  at the end of a word.   Plosive stops  /p, t, k/  become nasal stops  [m, n, ]  before nasal stops.   Hangul  spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying, partly historical  morphology . Given this, it is sometimes hard to tell which actual phonemes are present in a certain word.   One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial  [r] , and initial  [n] . For example,     ""labour"" - north:  r odong  (), south:  n odong  ()   ""history"" - north:  ry ksa  (), south:  y eoksa  ()   ""female"" - north:  ny ja  (), south:  y eoja  ()       [ edit ]   Morphophonemics   Grammatical morphemes may change shape depending on the preceding sounds. Examples include  -eun/-neun  (-/-) and  -i/-ga  (-/-). Sometimes sounds may be inserted instead. Examples include  -eul/-reul  (-/-),  -euro/-ro  (-/-),  -eseo/-seo  (-/-),  -ideunji/-deunji  (-/-) and  -iya/-ya  (-/-). However,  -euro/-ro  is somewhat irregular, since it will behave differently after a rieul consonant.     Korean particles     After a consonant   After a rieul   After a vowel       -ui  (-)       -eun  (-)   -neun  (-)       -i  (-)   -ga  (-)       -eul  (-)   -reul  (-)       -gwa  (-)   -wa  (-)       -euro  (-)   -ro  (-)       Some verbs may also change shape morphophonemically.     [ edit ]   Grammar   Main article:  Korean grammar     [ edit ]   Sentence structure   Korean is an  agglutinative language . Modifiers generally precede the modified words, and in the case of verb modifiers, can be serially appended. The basic form of a Korean sentence is  Subject Object Verb , but the verb is the only required and immovable element.       A :       -       -? (?)           kage-e     kasseo-yo           store + [location marker ()]     [go (verb root) ()]+[conjunctive ()]+[past ()]+[conjunctive ()]+ [polite marker ()]         ""Did [you] go to the store?"" (with ""you"" implied by context)         B :       .           ye           yes         ""Yes.""       [ edit ]   Parts of speech     [ edit ]   Verb   Korean  verbs  (  ,  tongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""action verbs"" or ""dynamic verbs"" to distinguish them from [  () ,  hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""]), which are also known as ""descriptive verbs"" or ""stative verbs"". Examples of action/dynamic verbs include    ( hada , ""to do"") and    ( kada , ""to go"") which constitute an action or movement as opposed to descriptive verbs such as    ( yehppeuda , ""to be beautiful""). For a larger list of Korean verbs, see  wikt:Category:Korean verbs .   Unlike most of the European languages, Korean does not conjugate verbs using agreement with the subject, and nouns have no gender. Instead, verb conjugations depend upon the verb tense, aspect, mood, and the social relation between the speaker, the subjects, and the listeners. The system of speech levels and honorifics loosely resembles the  T-V distinction  of most  Indo-European languages . For example, different endings are used based on the speaker's relation with the person they are talking to or the person about which they are talking. Politeness is a critical part of Korean language and Korean culture, therefore, when talking to someone esteemed, the correct verb ending, which should have a lot of respect, must be chosen.     [ edit ]   Adjective   Words categorized as Korean  adjectives  (  ,  hyeong-yongsa ,   ) conjugate similarly to verbs, so some English texts call them ""descriptive verbs"" or "" stative verbs "", but they are distinctly separate from    ( tongsa ).   English does not have an identical grammatical category, so the English translation of Korean adjectives may misleadingly suggest that they are verbs. For example,    ( pukda ) translates literally as ""to be red"" and    ( aswipda ) often best translates as ""to lack"" or ""to want for"", but both are    ( hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""). For a larger list of Korean adjectives, see  wikt:Category:Korean adjectives .     [ edit ]   Determiner   Korean  determiners  (  ,  gwanhyeongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""determinatives"", ""adnominals"", ""pre-nouns"", ""attributives"", and ""unconjugated adjectives"". Examples include    ( kak , ""each""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean determiners .     [ edit ]   Noun   A large body of Korean  nouns  (  ,  myeongsa ,   ) stem from  Chinese characters , e.g.    (,  san , mountain),    (,  yeok , station),    (,  munhwa , culture), etc. Others are native to the Korean language, e.g.    ( nara , country),    ( nal , day). Many  Sino-Korean words  have a native Korean equivalent and vice versa, but not always. Nouns do not have  grammatical gender  and can be made  plural  by adding  to the end of the word, however in most instances the  singular  form is used even when in English it would be translated as plural. For example, while in English the sentence  ""there are three apples""  would use the plural  ""apples""  instead of the singular  ""apple"" , the Korean sentence    ( sagwa segae isssumnida ) maintains the word  ( sagwa , ""apple"") in its singular form, thus rendered in English as ""apple three(things) exist."" For a list of Korean nouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean nouns .     [ edit ]   Pronoun   Main article:  Korean pronouns   Korean  pronouns  (  ,  daemyeongsa ,   ) are highly influenced by the honorifics in the language. Pronouns change forms depending on the social status of the person or persons spoken to, e.g. the pronoun for ""I"" there is both the informal    ( na ) and the honorific/humble    ( jeo ). In general second person singular pronouns are avoided, especially when using honorific forms. For a larger list or Korean pronouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean pronouns .     [ edit ]   Adverb   Korean  adverbs  (  ,  busa ,   ) include    ( tto , ""also"") and    ( gadeuk , ""fully""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean adverbs .     [ edit ]   Particle   Korean  particles  (  ,  josa ,   ) are also known in English as "" postpositions "". Examples include    ( neun , topic marker) and    ( reul , object marker). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean particles .     [ edit ]   Interjection   Korean  interjections  (  ,  gamtansa ,   ) are also known in English as ""exclamations"". Examples include    ( ani , ""no""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean interjections .     [ edit ]   Number   Main article:  Korean numerals   Korean  numbers  or numerals (  ,  susa ,   ) consitute two regularly used sets: a native Korean set and a  Sino-Korean  set. The Sino-Korean system is nearly entirely based on the  Chinese numerals . The distinction between the two numeral systems is very important. Everything that can be counted will use one of the two systems, but seldom both. Sino-Korean words are sometimes used to mark ordinal usage: yeol beon ( ) means ""ten times"" while sip beon (() ()) means ""number ten."" The grouping of large numbers in Korean follow the Chinese tradition of myriads (10000) rather than thousands (1000) as is common in Europe and North America.     [ edit ]   Speech levels and honorifics   Main article:  Korean honorifics   The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean, and the grammar reflects this. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject referent is reflected in  honorifics , while that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in  speech level .     [ edit ]   Honorifics   When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a younger stranger, student, employee or the like. Nowadays, there are special endings which can be used on declarative, interrogative, and imperative sentences; and both honorific or normal sentences. They are made for easier and faster use of Korean.     [ edit ]   Speech levels   There are seven verb  paradigms  or  speech levels  in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation. [ citation needed ]  Unlike  honorifics   which are used to show respect towards the referent   speech levels  are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience. The names of the 7 levels are derived from the non-honorific  imperative  form of the verb    ( hada , ""do"") in each level, plus the suffix  ('che',  hanja :   ), which means ""style.""   The highest 6 levels are generally grouped together as  jondaenmal  (), while the lowest level ( haeche , ) is called  banmal  () in Korean.     [ edit ]   Vocabulary   The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words. Like Japanese and Vietnamese, more than 50% of the vocabulary (up to 60% by some estimates), especially words that denote abstract ideas, are  Sino-Korean words , [ 7 ]  either     directly borrowed from  Written Chinese , or   coined in Japan or Korea using  Chinese characters ,     in a similar way European languages borrow from Latin and Greek. Korean has two  number systems : one native, and one borrowed from Chinese.   To a much lesser extent, words have also occasionally been borrowed from  Mongolian ,  Sanskrit , and other languages. Conversely, the Korean language itself has also contributed some loanwords to other languages, most notably the  Tsushima dialect  of Japanese.   The vast majority of loanwords other than Sino-Korean come from modern times, 90% of which are from  English . [ 8 ]  Many words have also been borrowed from  Japanese  and  Western languages  such as  German  ( areubaiteu  part-time job,  allereugi  allergy). Some Western words were borrowed indirectly via Japanese, taking a Japanese sound pattern, for example dozen >     dsu  >     daseu . Most indirect Western borrowings are now written according to current Hangulization rules for the respective Western language, as if borrowed directly. There are a few more complicated borrowings such as German(y) (see  Names for Germany ), the first part of whose  endonym   [d.lant]  the Japanese approximated using the  kanji      doitsu  that were then accepted into the Korean language by their Sino-Korean pronunciation:     dok  +     il  =  Dogil . In South Korean official use, a number of other Sino-Korean country names have been replaced with phonetically oriented Hangulizations of the countries' endonyms or English names.   North Korean vocabulary shows a tendency to prefer native Korean over Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings, especially with recent political objectives aimed at eliminating foreign (mostly Chinese) influences on the Korean language in the North. By contrast, South Korean may have several Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings which tend to be absent in North Korean.     [ edit ]   Writing system       Korean writing systems           Hangul       Hanja       Hyangchal   Gugyeol   Idu       Mixed script       Korean romanization       Revised Romanization of Korean   McCune-Reischauer   Yale Romanization           Main article:  Hangul   See also:  Hangul consonant and vowel tables   In ancient times, the languages of the Korean peninsula were written using  Chinese characters , using  hyangchal  or  idu . Such systems were not popular because hanja is not well suited to the Korean language. Its use is now limited.   Korean is now mainly written in Hangul, the Korean alphabet promulgated in 1446 by  Sejong the Great ;  hanja may be mixed in  to write  Sino-Korean words . South Korea still teaches 1800 hanja characters in its schools, while the North abolished the use of hanja decades ago.   Below is a chart of the Korean alphabet's symbols and their canonical  IPA  values:     Consonants     Hangul                                                                        RR   b , p   d , t   j   g , k   pp   tt   jj   kk   p   t   ch   k   s   h   ss   m   n   ng       r , l           IPA   p   t      k   p   t      k   p   t      k   s   h   s   m   n      w   r   j         Vowels     Hangul                                                                      RR   i   e   oe   ae   a   o   u   eo   eu   ui   ye   yae   ya   yo   yu   yeo   wi   we   wae   wa   wo       IPA   i   e         a   o   u         i   je   j   ja   jo   ju   j   wi   we   w   wa   w       Modern Korean is written with  spaces  between  words , a feature not found in Chinese or Japanese. Korean  punctuation  marks are almost identical to Western ones. Traditionally, Korean was written in columns from top to bottom, right to left, but is now usually written in rows from left to right, top to bottom.     [ edit ]   Differences between North Korean and South Korean   Main article:  Korean language North-South differences   The Korean language used in the North and the South exhibits differences in pronunciation, spelling, grammar and vocabulary. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Pronunciation   In North Korea,  palatalization  of  /si/  is optional, and  //  can be pronounced as  [z]  in between vowels.   Words that are written the same way may be pronounced differently, such as the examples below. The pronunciations below are given in  Revised Romanization ,  McCune-Reischauer  and Hangul, the last of which represents what the Hangul would be if one writes the word as pronounced.       Word   Meaning   Pronunciation       North (RR/MR)   North (Hangul)   South (RR/MR)   South (Hangul)          wide   neo p tta (n p ta)      neo l tta (n l ta)             to read  (continuative form)   i l kko (i l ko)      i l kko (i l ko)             Amnok River   am r okgang (am r okkang)      am n okkang (am n okkang)             independence   dong r ip (tong r ip)      dong n ip (tong n ip)             idea / sense / conception   gwa ll yeom (kwa ll ym)      gwa nn yeom (kwa nn ym)          *   innovative   hyeoksin jj eok (hyksin tch k)      hyeoksin j eok (hyksin j k)          * Similar pronunciation is used in the North whenever the hanja """" is attached to a Sino-Korean word ending in ,  or . (In the South, this rule only applies when it is attached to any single-character Sino-Korean word.)     [ edit ]   Spelling   Some words are spelled differently by the North and the South, but the pronunciations are the same.       Word spelling   Meaning   Pronunciation (RR/MR)   Remarks       North   South             sunshine   haeppit (haepit)   The ""sai siot"" ('' used for indicating sound change) is almost never written out in the North.             cherry blossom   beotkkot (ptkkot)                cannot read   monnikda (monnikta)   Spacing.             Hallasan   hallasan (hallasan)   When a - combination is pronounced as  ll , the original Hangul spelling is kept in the North, while the Hangul is changed in the South.             rules   gyuyul (kyuyul)   In words where the original hanja is spelt """" or """" and follows a vowel, the initial  is not pronounced in the North, making the pronunciation identical with that in the South where the  is dropped in the spelling.         [ edit ]   Spelling and pronunciation   Some words have different spellings and pronunciations in the North and the South, some of which were given in the ""Phonology"" section above:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          ryeongryang (ryngryang)      yeongnyang (yngnyang)   strength   Korean words originally starting in  r  or  n  have their  r  or  n  dropped in the South Korean version if the sound following it is an  i  or  y  sound.          rodong (rodong)      nodong (nodong)   work   Korean words originally starting in  r  have their  r  changed to  n  in the South Korean version if the sound following it is a sound other than  i  or  y .          wonssu (wnssu)      wonsu (wnsu)   mortal enemy   ""Mortal enemy"" and ""head of state"" are homophones in the South. Possibly to avoid referring to  Kim Il-sung  /  Kim Jong-il  as the enemy, the second syllable of ""enemy"" is written and pronounced  in the North.          rajio (rajio)      radio (radio)   radio            u (u)      wi (wi)   on; above            anhae (anhae)      anae (anae)   wife            kkuba (kkuba)      kuba (k'uba)   Cuba   When transcribing foreign words from languages that do not have contrasts between aspirated and unaspirated stops, North Koreans generally use tensed stops for the unaspirated ones while South Koreans use aspirated stops in both cases.          pe (p'e)      pye (p'ye), pe (p'e)   lungs   All hanja pronounced as  pye  ( p'ye ) or  pe  ( p'e ) in the South are pronounced as  pe  ( p'e ) in the North. The spelling is also accordingly different.       In general, when transcribing place names, North Korea tends to use the pronunciation in the original language more than South Korea, which often uses the pronunciation in English. For example:       Original name   North Korea transliteration   English name   South Korea transliteration       Spelling   Pronunciation   Spelling   Pronunciaton       Ulaanbaatar      ullanbattareu (ullanbattar)   Ulan Bator      ullanbatoreu (ullanbat'or)       Kbenhavn      koeppenhabeun (k'oeppenhabn)   Copenhagen      kopenhagen (k'op'enhagen)       al-Qhirah      kkahira (kkahira)   Cairo      kairo (k'airo)         [ edit ]   Grammar   Some grammatical constructions are also different:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          doeyeotda (toeytta)      doeeotda (toetta)   past tense of  (doeda/toeda), ""to become""   All similar grammar forms of verbs or adjectives that end in  in the stem (i.e. , , , ,  and ) in the North use  instead of the South's .          gomawayo (komawayo)      gomawoyo (komawyo)   thanks   -irregular verbs in the North use  (wa) for all those with a positive ending vowel; this only happens in the South if the verb stem has only one syllable.          halgayo (halkayo)      halkkayo (halkkayo)   Shall we do?   Although the Hangul differ, the pronunciations are the same (i.e. with the tensed  sound).         [ edit ]   Vocabulary   Some vocabulary is different between the North and the South:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          munhwajutaek (munhwajut'aek)      apateu (ap'at')   Apartment     (appateu/appat') is also used in the North.          joseonmal (chosnmal)      han-gugeo(han'gugeo)   Korean language            gwakbap (kwakpap)      dosirak (tosirak)   lunch box           [ edit ]   Others   In the North,  guillemets     and    are the symbols used for quotes; in the South, quotation marks equivalent to the English ones,  and , are standard, although     and     are sometimes used in popular novels.     [ edit ]   Study by non-native speakers   The  United States '  Defense Language Institute  classifies Korean alongside  Arabic ,  Chinese , and  Japanese  as a Category IV language, meaning that 63 weeks of instruction (as compared to just 25 weeks for  French ,  Spanish ,  Portuguese , and  Italian ) are required to bring an English-speaking student to a limited working level of proficiency in which he or she has ""sufficient capability to meet routine social demands and limited job requirements"" and ""can deal with concrete topics in past, present, and future tense."" [ 10 ]  As a result, the study of the Korean language in the United States is dominated by  Korean American  heritage language students; they are estimated to form over 80% of all students of the language at non-military universities. [ 11 ]   However, Korean is considerably easier for speakers of certain other languages, such as Japanese, Mongolian and Turkic languages; in Japan, it is more widely studied by non-heritage learners. [ 12 ]  The  Korean Language Proficiency Test , an examination aimed at assessing non-native speakers' competence in Korean, was instituted in 1997; 17,000 people applied for the 2005 sitting of the examination.

Korean  (  /  , see  below ) is the official  language  of  North Korea  and  South Korea . It is also one of the two official languages in the  Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture  in  China . There are about 78 million Korean speakers. It was formerly written using  Hanja , borrowed  Chinese characters  pronounced in the Korean way. In the 15th century a national writing system was developed by  Sejong the Great , nowadays called  Hangul .   The genealogical  classification  of the Korean language is debated. Some linguists place it in the  Altaic  language family, while others consider it to be a  language isolate . It is  agglutinative  in its morphology and  SOV  in its  syntax .

In South Korea, the language is most often called  Hangungmal  (  ;   ), or more formally,  Hangugeo  (  ;   ) or  Gugeo  (  ;   ; literally ""national language"").   In North Korea and Yanbian in China, the language is most often called  Chosnmal  (  ; with  hanja :   ), or more formally,  Chosn  (  ;   ).   On the other hand, Korean people in the  former USSR , who refer to themselves as  Koryo-saram  (also  Goryeoin  [  ;   ; literally, "" Goryeo  person(s)""]) call the language  Goryeomal  (  ;   ).   In  mainland China , following the establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992, the term  Choxiny  (   or short form:  Choy  (  )) has normally been used to refer to the language spoken in North Korea and Yanbian, while  Hnguy  (   or short form:  Hny  (  )) is used to refer to the language spoken in South Korea.   Some older English sources also used the name ""Korean"" to refer to the language, country, and people.     [ edit ]   History       Main article:  History of the Korean language       Korean is descended from  Old Korean  and  Middle Korean .     [ edit ]   Classification   The classification of the modern Korean language is uncertain, and due to the lack of any one generally accepted theory, it is sometimes described conservatively as a  language isolate .   On the other hand, since the publication of the article of  Ramstedt  in 1926, many linguists support the hypothesis that Korean can be classified as an  Altaic  language, or as a relative of proto-Altaic. Korean is similar to Altaic languages in that they both lack certain grammatical elements, including  number ,  gender ,  articles , fusional morphology, voice, and  relative pronouns  (Kim Namkil). Korean especially bears some  morphological  resemblance to some languages of the Northern Turkic group, namely  Sakha (Yakut) . Vinokurova, a scholar of the Sakha language, noted that like in Korean, and unlike in other  Turkic languages  or a variety of other languages surveyed, adverbs in Sakha are derived from verbs with the help of derivational morphology; however, she did not suggest this implied any relation between the two languages. [ 2 ]   It is also considered likely that Korean is related in some way to  Japanese , since the two languages have nearly identical grammatical structures, and share a number of possible phonological cognates (though a majority of them are likely due to local pronunciations of the Chinese characters from which they are derived), as noted by such researchers as  Samuel E. Martin  and  Roy Andrew Miller  in the late 1960s.  Sergei Starostin  (1991) found about 25% of potential cognates in the Japanese-Korean 100-word  Swadesh list , which places these two languages closer together than other possible members of the Altaic family. [ 3 ]   Genetic relationships have been postulated both directly and indirectly, the latter either through placing both languages in the Altaic family, or by arguing for a relationship between Japanese and the  Buyeo languages  of  Goguryeo  and  Baekje  (see below); the proposed Baekje relationship is supported by cognates such as Baekje  mir , Japanese  mi-  ""three"". [ 4 ]   The possible relationship between Korean and Japanese can be exemplified by such basic vocabularly items as J.     mizu  (Old J.  midu ) : K.     mul  (Middle K.  mirh ) ""water"",  mot  ""lake""; J.     ku-ru  ""come"" (Old J.  ku , also cf. irregular root changes as in past tense   ki-ta , negative   ko-nai  in Modern J.) : K.     ka-da  (""go""); J.     kata-i  ""hard"" (whence     kata-na  ""knife, sword"") : K.  kud-yn  (hard); J.     i-ru  ""to be"" (past tense   i-ta ) : K.     i-da  ""to be""; J.  na ,  -en  : K.  anh  ""not"", J.  minna  (Old J.  mynna ) ""all, everyone"" : K.  manh-  ""many"" (predicate  mana-da ), etc.  [ 5 ] . The same possible cognates are often observed in other members of the potential  Altaic family , esp. in the  Tungusic languages . Cf. Nanay  mue  ""water"",  giagda-  ""to walk"",  anaa, anna  ""not"".   Others argue, however, that the similarities are not due to any genetic relationship, but rather to a  sprachbund  effect. See  East Asian languages  for morphological features shared among languages of the East Asian  sprachbund , and  Classification of Japanese  for further details on the possible relationship.   It is presumed that modern Korean may be more closely related to the languages of  Samhan  and  Silla  than the Buyeo languages; many Korean scholars believe they were mutually intelligible, and the collective basis of what in the  Goryeo  period would merge to become Middle Korean (the language before the changes that the  Seven-Year War  brought) and eventually Modern Korean. The  Jeju dialect  preserves some archaic features that can also be found in Middle Korean, whose  arae a  is retained in the dialect as a distinct vowel.   There are also more marginal hypotheses proposing various other relationships; for example, a few scholars, such as  Homer B. Hulbert  (1905), have tried to relate Korean to the  Dravidian languages  through the similar syntax in both. [ 6 ]   Though not related to Chinese, it has borrowed heavily; see the Vocabulary section below.     [ edit ]   Dialects       Main article:  Korean dialects              Dialects of Korean       Korean has several  dialects  (called  mal  [literally ""speech""],  saturi , or  bang-eon  in Korean). The  standard language  ( pyojuneo  or  pyojunmal ) of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  P'yngyang . These dialects are similar, and are in fact all mutually intelligible, perhaps with the exception of the dialect of  Jeju Island  (see  Jeju dialect ). The dialect spoken in Jeju is in fact classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of  Seoul dialect  use very little stress, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of the  Gyeongsang dialect  have a very pronounced intonation.   It is also worth noting that there is substantial evidence for a history of extensive  dialect levelling , or even  convergent evolution  or intermixture of two or more originally distinct linguistic stocks, within the Korean language and its dialects. Many Korean dialects have basic vocabulary that is etymologically distinct from vocabulary of identical meaning in Standard Korean or other dialects, such as South Jeolla dialect /kur/ vs. Standard Korean     /ip/  ""mouth"" or Gyeongsang dialect  /.u.i/  vs. Standard Korean  /puu/  "" garlic chives ."" This suggests that the Korean Peninsula may have at one time been much more linguistically diverse than it is at present. [ citation needed ]  See also the  Buyeo languages   hypothesis .   There is a very close connection between the dialects of Korean and the  regions of Korea , since the boundaries of both are largely determined by mountains and seas. Here is a list of traditional dialect names and locations:       Standard dialect   Where used       Seoul   Seoul  (),  Incheon  (/), most of  Gyeonggi  (/)       P'yngan  (/)   P'yngyang ,  P'yngan  region,  Chagang  (North Korea)       Regional dialect   Where used       Gyeonggi   limited areas of the  Gyeonggi  region (South Korea)       Chungcheong   Daejeon ,  Chungcheong  region (South Korea)       Gangwon   Gangwon-do (South Korea) / Kangwn (North Korea)       Gyeongsang   Busan ,  Daegu ,  Ulsan ,  Gyeongsang  region (South Korea)       Hamgyng   Rasn ,  Hamgyng  region,  Ryanggang  (North Korea)       Hwanghae   Hwanghae  region (North Korea)       Jeju   Jeju Island/Province  (South Korea)       Jeolla   Gwangju ,  Jeolla  region (South Korea)         [ edit ]   Phonology       This article contains  IPA  phonetic symbols.

Main article:  Korean phonology         [ edit ]   Consonants          The Korean consonants             Bilabial   Alveolar   Post-  alveolar   Velar   Glottal       Nasal      /m/      /n/        //  (syllable-final)         Plosive  and   Affricate   plain      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         tense      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         aspirated      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         Fricative   plain        /s/          /h/       tense        /s/             Liquid        /l/           The  IPA  symbol <  > (a subscript double straight quotation mark, shown here with a placeholder circle) is used to denote the tensed consonants  /p/, /t/, /k/, //, /s/ . Its official use in the  Extensions to the IPA  is for  'strong'  articulation, but is used in the literature for  faucalized voice . The Korean consonants also have elements of  stiff voice , but it is not yet known how typical this is of faucalized consonants. They are produced with a partially constricted  glottis  and additional subglottal pressure in addition to tense vocal tract walls, laryngeal lowering, or other expansion of the larynx.     [ edit ]   Vowels                    The Korean basic vowels                 Monophthongs   /i/    ,  /e/    ,  //    ,  /a/    ,  /o/    ,  /u/    ,  //    ,  //    ,  //          Vowels preceded by intermediaries,  or Diphthongs   /je/    ,  /j/    ,  /ja/    ,  /wi/    ,  /we/    ,  /w/    ,  /wa/    ,  /i/    ,  /jo/    ,  /ju/    ,  /j/    ,  /w/            [ edit ]   Allophones   /s/  becomes an  alveolo-palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i]  for most speakers (but see  Differences in the language between North Korea and South Korea ). This occurs with the tense fricative and all the affricates as well. At the end of a syllable, /s/ changes to /t/ (Example: beoseot () 'mushroom').   /h/  may become a  bilabial   []  before  [o]  or  [u] , a  palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i] , a  velar   [x]  before  [] , a voiced  []  between voiced sounds, and a  [h]  elsewhere. [ citation needed ]   /p, t, , k/  become voiced  [b, d, , ]  between voiced sounds.   /l/  becomes alveolar flap  []  between vowels, and  [l]  or  []  at the end of a syllable or next to another  /l/ . Note that a written syllable-final '', when followed by a vowel or a glide ( i.e. , when the next character starts with ''), migrates to the next syllable and thus becomes  [] .   Traditionally,  /l/  was disallowed at the beginning of a word. It disappeared before  [j] , and otherwise became  /n/ . However, the inflow of western loanword changed the trend, and now word-initial  /l/  (mostly from English loanwords) are pronounced as a free variation of either  []  or  [l] . The traditional prohibition of word-initial  /l/  became a morphological rule called ""initial law"" () in South Korea, which pertains to Sino-Korean vocabulary. Such words retain their word-initial  /l/  in North Korea.   All  obstruents  (plosives, affricates, fricatives) are  unreleased   [p, t, k]  at the end of a word.   Plosive stops  /p, t, k/  become nasal stops  [m, n, ]  before nasal stops.   Hangul  spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying, partly historical  morphology . Given this, it is sometimes hard to tell which actual phonemes are present in a certain word.   One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial  [r] , and initial  [n] . For example,     ""labour"" - north:  r odong  (), south:  n odong  ()   ""history"" - north:  ry ksa  (), south:  y eoksa  ()   ""female"" - north:  ny ja  (), south:  y eoja  ()       [ edit ]   Morphophonemics   Grammatical morphemes may change shape depending on the preceding sounds. Examples include  -eun/-neun  (-/-) and  -i/-ga  (-/-). Sometimes sounds may be inserted instead. Examples include  -eul/-reul  (-/-),  -euro/-ro  (-/-),  -eseo/-seo  (-/-),  -ideunji/-deunji  (-/-) and  -iya/-ya  (-/-). However,  -euro/-ro  is somewhat irregular, since it will behave differently after a rieul consonant.     Korean particles     After a consonant   After a rieul   After a vowel       -ui  (-)       -eun  (-)   -neun  (-)       -i  (-)   -ga  (-)       -eul  (-)   -reul  (-)       -gwa  (-)   -wa  (-)       -euro  (-)   -ro  (-)       Some verbs may also change shape morphophonemically.     [ edit ]   Grammar       Main article:  Korean grammar         [ edit ]   Sentence structure   Korean is an  agglutinative language . Modifiers generally follow the modified word, and in the case of verb modifiers, can be serially appended. The basic form of a Korean sentence is  Subject Object Verb , but the verb is the only required and immovable element.       A :       -       -? (?)           gage-e     gasseo-yo           store + [location marker ()]     [go (verb root) ()]+[conjunctive ()]+[past ()]+[conjunctive ()]+ [interrogative marker ()]         ""Did [you] go to the store?"" (with ""you"" implied by context)         B :       .           ne           yes         ""Yes.""       [ edit ]   Parts of speech     [ edit ]   Verb   Korean  verbs  (  ,  dongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""action verbs"" or ""dynamic verbs"" to distinguish them from [  () ,  hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""]), which are also known as ""descriptive verbs"" or ""stative verbs"". Examples of action/dynamic verbs include    ( hada , ""to do, to have"") and    ( gada , ""to go"") which constitute an action or movement as opposed to descriptive verbs such as    ( yehppeuda , ""to be beautiful""). For a larger list of Korean verbs, see  wikt:Category:Korean verbs .   Unlike most of the European languages, Korean does not conjugate verbs using agreement with the subject, and nouns have no gender. Instead, verb conjugations depend upon the verb tense, aspect, mood, and the social relation between the speaker, the subjects, and the listeners. The system of speech levels and honorifics loosely resembles the  T-V distinction  of most  Indo-European languages . For example, different endings are used based on whether the subjects and listeners are friends, parents, or honoured persons.     [ edit ]   Adjective   Words categorized as Korean  adjectives  (  ,  hyeong-yongsa ,   ) conjugate similarly to verbs, so some English texts call them ""descriptive verbs"" or "" stative verbs "", but they are distinctly separate from    ( dongsa ).   English does not have an identical grammatical category, so the English translation of Korean adjectives may misleadingly suggest that they are verbs. For example,    ( bukda ) translates literally as ""to be red"" and    ( aswipda ) often best translates as ""to lack"" or ""to want for"", but both are    ( hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""). For a larger list of Korean adjectives, see  wikt:Category:Korean adjectives .     [ edit ]   Determiner   Korean  determiners  (  ,  gwanhyeongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""determinatives"", ""adnominals"", ""pre-nouns"", ""attributives"", and ""unconjugated adjectives"". Examples include    ( gak , ""each""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean determiners .     [ edit ]   Noun   A large body of Korean  nouns  (  ,  myeongsa ,   ) stem from  Chinese characters , e.g.    (,  san , mountain),    (,  yeok , station),    (,  munhwa , culture), etc. Others are native to the Korean language, e.g.    ( nara , country),    ( nal , day). Many  Sino-Korean words  have a native Korean equivalent and vice versa, but not always. Nouns do not have  grammatical gender  and can be made  plural  by adding  to the end of the word, however in most instances the  singular  form is used even when in English it would be translated as plural. For example, while in English the sentence  ""there are three apples""  would use the plural  ""apples""  instead of the singular  ""apple"" , the Korean sentence    ( sagwa segae isssumnida ) maintains the word  ( sagwa , ""apple"") in its singular form, thus rendered in English as ""apple three(things) exist."" For a list of Korean nouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean nouns .     [ edit ]   Pronoun       Main article:  Korean pronouns       Korean  pronouns  (  ,  daemyeongsa ,   ) are highly influenced by the honorifics in the language. Pronouns change forms depending on the social status of the person or persons spoken to, e.g. the pronoun for ""I"" there is both the informal    ( na ) and the honorific/humble    ( jeo ). In general second person singular pronouns are avoided, especially when using honorific forms. For a larger list or Korean pronouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean pronouns .     [ edit ]   Adverb   Korean  adverbs  (  ,  busa ,   ) include    ( tto , ""also"") and    ( gadeuk , ""fully""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean adverbs .     [ edit ]   Particle   Korean  particles  (  ,  josa ,   ) are also known in English as "" postpositions "". Examples include    ( neun , topic marker) and    ( reul , object marker). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean particles .     [ edit ]   Interjection   Korean  interjections  (  ,  gamtansa ,   ) are also known in English as ""exclamations"". Examples include    ( ani , ""no""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean interjections .     [ edit ]   Number       Main article:  Korean numerals       Korean  numbers  or numerals (  ,  sutja ,   ) consitute two regularly used sets: a native Korean set and a  Sino-Korean  set. The Sino-Korean system is nearly entirely based on the  Chinese numerals . The distinction between the two numeral systems is very important. Everything that can be counted will use one of the two systems, but seldom both. Sino-Korean words are sometimes used to mark ordinal usage: yeol beon ( ) means ""ten times"" while sip beon (() ()) means ""number ten."" The grouping of large numbers in Korean follow the Chinese tradition of myriads (10000) rather than thousands (1000) as is common in Europe and North America.     [ edit ]   Speech levels and honorifics       Main article:  Korean honorifics       The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean, and the grammar reflects this. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject referent is reflected in  honorifics , while that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in  speech level .     [ edit ]   Honorifics   When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a younger stranger, student, employee or the like. Nowadays, there are special endings which can be used on declarative, interrogative, and imperative sentences; and both honorific or normal sentences. They are made for easier and faster use of Korean.     [ edit ]   Speech levels   There are seven verb  paradigms  or  speech levels  in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation. [ citation needed ]  Unlike  honorifics   which are used to show respect towards the referent   speech levels  are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience. The names of the 7 levels are derived from the non-honorific  imperative  form of the verb    ( hada , ""do"") in each level, plus the suffix  ('che',  hanja :   ), which means ""style.""   The highest 6 levels are generally grouped together as  jondaenmal  (), while the lowest level ( haeche , ) is called  banmal  () in Korean.     [ edit ]   Vocabulary   The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words. Like Japanese and Vietnamese, more than 50% of the vocabulary (up to 60% by some estimates), especially words that denote abstract ideas, are  Sino-Korean words , [ 7 ]  either     directly borrowed from  Written Chinese , or   coined in Japan or Korea using  Chinese characters ,     in a similar way European languages borrow from Latin and Greek. Korean has two  number systems : one native, and one borrowed from Chinese.   To a much lesser extent, words have also occasionally been borrowed from  Mongolian ,  Sanskrit , and other languages. Conversely, the Korean language itself has also contributed some loanwords to other languages, most notably the  Tsushima dialect  of Japanese.   The vast majority of loanwords other than Sino-Korean come from modern times, 90% of which are from  English . [ 8 ]  Many words have also been borrowed from  Japanese  and  Western languages  such as  German  ( areubaiteu  part-time job,  allereugi  allergy). Some Western words were borrowed indirectly via Japanese, taking a Japanese sound pattern, for example dozen >     dsu  >     daseu . Most indirect Western borrowings are now written according to current Hangulization rules for the respective Western language, as if borrowed directly. There are a few more complicated borrowings such as German(y) (see  Names for Germany ), the first part of whose  endonym   [d.lant]  the Japanese approximated using the  kanji      doitsu  that were then accepted into the Korean language by their Sino-Korean pronunciation:     dok  +     il  =  Dogil . In South Korean official use, a number of other Sino-Korean country names have been replaced with phonetically oriented Hangulizations of the countries' endonyms or English names.   North Korean vocabulary shows a tendency to prefer native Korean over Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings, especially with recent political objectives aimed at eliminating foreign (mostly Chinese) influences on the Korean language in the North. By contrast, South Korean may have several Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings which tend to be absent in North Korean.     [ edit ]   Writing system       Korean writing systems           Hangul       Hanja       Hyangchal   Gugyeol   Idu       Mixed script       Korean romanization       Revised Romanization of Korean   McCune-Reischauer   Yale Romanization               Main article:  Hangul     See also:  Hangul consonant and vowel tables     In ancient times, the languages of the Korean peninsula were written using  Chinese characters , using  hyangchal  or  idu . Such systems were not popular because hanja is not well suited to the Korean language. Its use is now limited, although the aristocracy prefers  Classical Chinese  for its writing.   Korean is now mainly written in Hangul, the Korean alphabet promulgated in 1446 by  Sejong the Great ;  hanja may be mixed in  to write  Sino-Korean words . South Korea still teaches 1800 hanja characters in its schools, while the North abolished the use of hanja decades ago.   Below is a chart of the Korean alphabet's symbols and their canonical  IPA  values:     Consonants     Hangul                                                                        RR   b , p   d , t   j   g , k   pp   tt   jj   kk   p   t   ch   k   s   h   ss   m   n   ng       r , l           IPA   p   t      k   p   t      k   p   t      k   s   h   s   m   n      w   r   j         Vowels     Hangul                                                                      RR   i   e   oe   ae   a   o   u   eo   eu   ui   ye   yae   ya   yo   yu   yeo   wi   we   wae   wa   wo       IPA   i   e         a   o   u         i   je   j   ja   jo   ju   j   wi   we   w   wa   w       Modern Korean is written with  spaces  between  words , a feature not found in Chinese or Japanese. Korean  punctuation  marks are almost identical to Western ones. Traditionally, Korean was written in columns from top to bottom, right to left, but is now usually written in rows from left to right, top to bottom.     [ edit ]   Differences between North Korean and South Korean       Main article:  Korean language North-South differences       The Korean language used in the North and the South exhibits differences in pronunciation, spelling, grammar and vocabulary. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Pronunciation   In North Korea,  palatalization  of  /si/  is optional, and  //  can be pronounced as  [z]  in between vowels.   Words that are written the same way may be pronounced differently, such as the examples below. The pronunciations below are given in  Revised Romanization ,  McCune-Reischauer  and Hangul, the last of which represents what the Hangul would be if one writes the word as pronounced.       Word   Meaning   Pronunciation       North (RR/MR)   North (Hangul)   South (RR/MR)   South (Hangul)          wide   neo p tta (n p ta)      neo l tta (n l ta)             to read  (continuative form)   i l kko (i l ko)      i l kko (i l ko)             Amnok River   am r okgang (am r okkang)      am n okkang (am n okkang)             independence   dong r ip (tong r ip)      dong n ip (tong n ip)             idea / sense / conception   gwa ll yeom (kwa ll ym)      gwa nn yeom (kwa nn ym)          *   innovative   hyeoksin jj eok (hyksin tch k)      hyeoksin j eok (hyksin j k)          * Similar pronunciation is used in the North whenever the hanja """" is attached to a Sino-Korean word ending in ,  or . (In the South, this rule only applies when it is attached to any single-character Sino-Korean word.)     [ edit ]   Spelling   Some words are spelled differently by the North and the South, but the pronunciations are the same.       Word spelling   Meaning   Pronunciation (RR/MR)   Remarks       North   South             sunshine   haeppit (haepit)   The ""sai siot"" ('' used for indicating sound change) is almost never written out in the North.             cherry blossom   beotkkot (ptkkot)                cannot read   monnikda (monnikta)   Spacing.             Hallasan   hallasan (hallasan)   When a - combination is pronounced as  ll , the original Hangul spelling is kept in the North, while the Hangul is changed in the South.             rules   gyuyul (kyuyul)   In words where the original hanja is spelt """" or """" and follows a vowel, the initial  is not pronounced in the North, making the pronunciation identical with that in the South where the  is dropped in the spelling.         [ edit ]   Spelling and pronunciation   Some words have different spellings and pronunciations in the North and the South, some of which were given in the ""Phonology"" section above:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          ryeongryang (ryngryang)      yeongnyang (yngnyang)   strength   Korean words originally starting in  r  or  n  have their  r  or  n  dropped in the South Korean version if the sound following it is an  i  or  y  sound.          rodong (rodong)      nodong (nodong)   work   Korean words originally starting in  r  have their  r  changed to  n  in the South Korean version if the sound following it is a sound other than  i  or  y .          wonssu (wnssu)      wonsu (wnsu)   mortal enemy   ""Mortal enemy"" and ""head of state"" are homophones in the South. Possibly to avoid referring to  Kim Il-sung  /  Kim Jong-il  as the enemy, the second syllable of ""enemy"" is written and pronounced  in the North.          rajio (rajio)      radio (radio)   radio            u (u)      wi (wi)   on; above            anhae (anhae)      anae (anae)   wife            kkuba (kkuba)      kuba (k'uba)   Cuba   When transcribing foreign words from languages that do not have contrasts between aspirated and unaspirated stops, North Koreans generally use tensed stops for the unaspirated ones while South Koreans use aspirated stops in both cases.          pe (p'e)      pye (p'ye), pe (p'e)   lungs   All hanja pronounced as  pye  ( p'ye ) or  pe  ( p'e ) in the South are pronounced as  pe  ( p'e ) in the North. The spelling is also accordingly different.       In general, when transcribing place names, North Korea tends to use the pronunciation in the original language more than South Korea, which often uses the pronunciation in English. For example:       Original name   North Korea transliteration   English name   South Korea transliteration       Spelling   Pronunciation   Spelling   Pronunciaton       Ulaanbaatar      ullanbattareu (ullanbattar)   Ulan Bator      ullanbatoreu (ullanbat'or)       Kbenhavn      koeppenhabeun (k'oeppenhabn)   Copenhagen      kopenhagen (k'op'enhagen)       al-Qhirah      kkahira (kkahira)   Cairo      kairo (k'airo)         [ edit ]   Grammar   Some grammatical constructions are also different:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          doeyeotda (toeytta)      doeeotda (toetta)   past tense of  (doeda/toeda), ""to become""   All similar grammar forms of verbs or adjectives that end in  in the stem (i.e. , , , ,  and ) in the North use  instead of the South's .          gomawayo (komawayo)      gomawoyo (komawyo)   thanks   -irregular verbs in the North use  (wa) for all those with a positive ending vowel; this only happens in the South if the verb stem has only one syllable.          halgayo (halkayo)      halkkayo (halkkayo)   Shall we do?   Although the Hangul differ, the pronunciations are the same (i.e. with the tensed  sound).         [ edit ]   Vocabulary   Some vocabulary is different between the North and the South:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          munhwajutaek (munhwajut'aek)      apateu (ap'at')   Apartment     (appateu/appat') is also used in the North.          joseonmal (chosnmal)      han-gugeo(han'gugeo)   Korean language            gwakbap (kwakpap)      dosirak (tosirak)   lunch box           [ edit ]   Others   In the North,  guillemets     and    are the symbols used for quotes; in the South, quotation marks equivalent to the English ones,  and , are standard, although     and     are sometimes used in popular novels.     [ edit ]   Study by non-native speakers   The  United States '  Defense Language Institute  classifies Korean alongside  Arabic ,  Chinese , and  Japanese  as a Category IV language, meaning that 63 weeks of instruction (as compared to just 25 weeks for  French ,  Spanish ,  Portuguese , and  Italian ) are required to bring an English-speaking student to a limited working level of proficiency in which he or she has ""sufficient capability to meet routine social demands and limited job requirements"" and ""can deal with concrete topics in past, present, and future tense."" [ 10 ]  As a result, the study of the Korean language in the United States is dominated by  Korean American  heritage language students; they are estimated to form over 80% of all students of the language at non-military universities. [ 11 ]   However, Korean is considerably easier for speakers of certain other languages, such as Japanese, Mongolian and Turkic languages; in Japan, it is more widely studied by non-heritage learners. [ 12 ]  The  Korean Language Proficiency Test , an examination aimed at assessing non-native speakers' competence in Korean, was instituted in 1997; 17,000 people applied for the 2005 sitting of the examination.

Korean  (  /  , see  below ) is the official  language  of  North Korea  and  South Korea . It is also one of the two official languages in the  Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture  in  China . There are about 78 million Korean speakers. It was formerly written using  Hanja , borrowed  Chinese characters  pronounced in the Korean way. In the 15th century a national writing system was developed by  Sejong the Great , nowadays called  Hangul .   The genealogical  classification  of the Korean language is debated. Some linguists place it in the  Altaic  language family, while others consider it to be a  language isolate . It is  agglutinative  in its morphology and  SOV  in its  syntax .

In South Korea, the language is most often called  Hangungmal  (  ;   ), or more formally,  Hangugeo  (  ;   ) or  Gugeo  (  ;   ; literally ""national language"").   In North Korea and Yanbian in China, the language is most often called  Chosnmal  (  ; with  hanja :   ), or more formally,  Chosn  (  ;   ).   On the other hand, Korean people in the  former USSR , who refer to themselves as  Koryo-saram  (also  Goryeoin  [  ;   ; literally, "" Goryeo  person(s)""]) call the language  Goryeomal  (  ;   ).   In  mainland China , following the establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992, the term  Choxiny  (   or short form:  Choy  (  )) has normally been used to refer to the language spoken in North Korea and Yanbian, while  Hnguy  (   or short form:  Hny  (  )) is used to refer to the language spoken in South Korea.   Some older English sources also used the name ""Korean"" to refer to the language, country, and people.     [ edit ]   History       Main article:  History of the Korean language       Korean is descended from  Old Korean  and  Middle Korean .     [ edit ]   Classification   The classification of the modern Korean language is uncertain, and due to the lack of any one generally accepted theory, it is sometimes described conservatively as a  language isolate .   On the other hand, since the publication of the article of  Ramstedt  in 1926, many linguists support the hypothesis that Korean can be classified as an  Altaic  language, or as a relative of proto-Altaic. Korean is similar to Altaic languages in that they both lack certain grammatical elements, including  number ,  gender ,  articles , fusional morphology, voice, and  relative pronouns  (Kim Namkil). Korean especially bears some  morphological  resemblance to some languages of the Northern Turkic group, namely  Sakha (Yakut) . Vinokurova, a scholar of the Sakha language, noted that like in Korean, and unlike in other  Turkic languages  or a variety of other languages surveyed, adverbs in Sakha are derived from verbs with the help of derivational morphology; however, she did not suggest this implied any relation between the two languages. [ 2 ]   It is also considered likely that Korean is related in some way to  Japanese , since the two languages have nearly identical grammatical structures, and share a number of possible phonological cognates (though a majority of them are likely due to local pronunciations of the Chinese characters from which they are derived), as noted by such researchers as  Samuel E. Martin  and  Roy Andrew Miller  in the late 1960s.  Sergei Starostin  (1991) found about 25% of potential cognates in the Japanese-Korean 100-word  Swadesh list , which places these two languages closer together than other possible members of the Altaic family. [ 3 ]   Genetic relationships have been postulated both directly and indirectly, the latter either through placing both languages in the Altaic family, or by arguing for a relationship between Japanese and the  Buyeo languages  of  Goguryeo  and  Baekje  (see below); the proposed Baekje relationship is supported by cognates such as Baekje  mir , Japanese  mi-  ""three"". [ 4 ]   The possible relationship between Korean and Japanese can be exemplified by such basic vocabularly items as J.     mizu  (Old J.  midu ) : K.     mul  (Middle K.  mirh ) ""water"",  mot  ""lake""; J.     ku-ru  ""come"" (Old J.  ku , also cf. irregular root changes as in past tense   ki-ta , negative   ko-nai  in Modern J.) : K.     ka-da  (""go""); J.     kata-i  ""hard"" (whence     kata-na  ""knife, sword"") : K.  kud-yn  (hard); J.     i-ru  ""to be"" (past tense   i-ta ) : K.     i-da  ""to be""; J.  na ,  -en  : K.  anh  ""not"", J.  minna  (Old J.  mynna ) ""all, everyone"" : K.  manh-  ""many"" (predicate  mana-da ), etc.  [ 5 ] . The same possible cognates are often observed in other members of the potential  Altaic family , esp. in the  Tungusic languages . Cf. Nanay  mue  ""water"",  giagda-  ""to walk"",  anaa, anna  ""not"".   Others argue, however, that the similarities are not due to any genetic relationship, but rather to a  sprachbund  effect. See  East Asian languages  for morphological features shared among languages of the East Asian  sprachbund , and  Classification of Japanese  for further details on the possible relationship.   It is presumed that modern Korean may be more closely related to the languages of  Samhan  and  Silla  than the Buyeo languages; many Korean scholars believe they were mutually intelligible, and the collective basis of what in the  Goryeo  period would merge to become Middle Korean (the language before the changes that the  Seven-Year War  brought) and eventually Modern Korean. The  Jeju dialect  preserves some archaic features that can also be found in Middle Korean, whose  arae a  is retained in the dialect as a distinct vowel.   There are also more marginal hypotheses proposing various other relationships; for example, a few scholars, such as  Homer B. Hulbert  (1905), have tried to relate Korean to the  Dravidian languages  through the similar syntax in both. [ 6 ]   Though not related to Chinese, it has borrowed heavily; see the Vocabulary section below.     [ edit ]   Dialects       Main article:  Korean dialects              Dialects of Korean       Korean has several  dialects  (called  mal  [literally ""speech""],  saturi , or  bang-eon  in Korean). The  standard language  ( pyojuneo  or  pyojunmal ) of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  P'yngyang . These dialects are similar, and are in fact all mutually intelligible, perhaps with the exception of the dialect of  Jeju Island  (see  Jeju dialect ). The dialect spoken in Jeju is in fact classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of  Seoul dialect  use very little stress, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of the  Gyeongsang dialect  have a very pronounced intonation.   It is also worth noting that there is substantial evidence for a history of extensive  dialect levelling , or even  convergent evolution  or intermixture of two or more originally distinct linguistic stocks, within the Korean language and its dialects. Many Korean dialects have basic vocabulary that is etymologically distinct from vocabulary of identical meaning in Standard Korean or other dialects, such as South Jeolla dialect /kur/ vs. Standard Korean     /ip/  ""mouth"" or Gyeongsang dialect  /.u.i/  vs. Standard Korean  /puu/  "" garlic chives ."" This suggests that the Korean Peninsula may have at one time been much more linguistically diverse than it is at present. [ citation needed ]  See also the  Buyeo languages   hypothesis .   There is a very close connection between the dialects of Korean and the  regions of Korea , since the boundaries of both are largely determined by mountains and seas. Here is a list of traditional dialect names and locations:       Standard dialect   Where used       Seoul   Seoul  (),  Incheon  (/), most of  Gyeonggi  (/)       P'yngan  (/)   P'yngyang ,  P'yngan  region,  Chagang  (North Korea)       Regional dialect   Where used       Gyeonggi   limited areas of the  Gyeonggi  region (South Korea)       Chungcheong   Daejeon ,  Chungcheong  region (South Korea)       Gangwon   Gangwon-do (South Korea) / Kangwn (North Korea)       Gyeongsang   Busan ,  Daegu ,  Ulsan ,  Gyeongsang  region (South Korea)       Hamgyng   Rasn ,  Hamgyng  region,  Ryanggang  (North Korea)       Hwanghae   Hwanghae  region (North Korea)       Jeju   Jeju Island/Province  (South Korea)       Jeolla   Gwangju ,  Jeolla  region (South Korea)         [ edit ]   Phonology       This article contains  IPA  phonetic symbols.

Main article:  Korean phonology         [ edit ]   Consonants          The Korean consonants             Bilabial   Alveolar   Post-  alveolar   Velar   Glottal       Nasal      /m/      /n/        //  (syllable-final)         Plosive  and   Affricate   plain      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         tense      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         aspirated      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         Fricative   plain        /s/          /h/       tense        /s/             Liquid        /l/           The  IPA  symbol <  > (a subscript double straight quotation mark, shown here with a placeholder circle) is used to denote the tensed consonants  /p/, /t/, /k/, //, /s/ . Its official use in the  Extensions to the IPA  is for  'strong'  articulation, but is used in the literature for  faucalized voice . The Korean consonants also have elements of  stiff voice , but it is not yet known how typical this is of faucalized consonants. They are produced with a partially constricted  glottis  and additional subglottal pressure in addition to tense vocal tract walls, laryngeal lowering, or other expansion of the larynx.     [ edit ]   Vowels                    The Korean basic vowels                 Monophthongs   /i/    ,  /e/    ,  //    ,  /a/    ,  /o/    ,  /u/    ,  //    ,  //    ,  //          Vowels preceded by intermediaries,  or Diphthongs   /je/    ,  /j/    ,  /ja/    ,  /wi/    ,  /we/    ,  /w/    ,  /wa/    ,  /i/    ,  /jo/    ,  /ju/    ,  /j/    ,  /w/            [ edit ]   Allophones   /s/  becomes an  alveolo-palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i]  for most speakers (but see  Differences in the language between North Korea and South Korea ). This occurs with the tense fricative and all the affricates as well. At the end of a syllable, /s/ changes to /t/ (Example: beoseot () 'mushroom').   /h/  may become a  bilabial   []  before  [o]  or  [u] , a  palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i] , a  velar   [x]  before  [] , a voiced  []  between voiced sounds, and a  [h]  elsewhere. [ citation needed ]   /p, t, , k/  become voiced  [b, d, , ]  between voiced sounds.   /l/  becomes alveolar flap  []  between vowels, and  [l]  or  []  at the end of a syllable or next to another  /l/ . Note that a written syllable-final '', when followed by a vowel or a glide ( i.e. , when the next character starts with ''), migrates to the next syllable and thus becomes  [] .   Traditionally,  /l/  was disallowed at the beginning of a word. It disappeared before  [j] , and otherwise became  /n/ . However, the inflow of western loanword changed the trend, and now word-initial  /l/  (mostly from English loanwords) are pronounced as a free variation of either  []  or  [l] . The traditional prohibition of word-initial  /l/  became a morphological rule called ""initial law"" () in South Korea, which pertains to Sino-Korean vocabulary. Such words retain their word-initial  /l/  in North Korea.   All  obstruents  (plosives, affricates, fricatives) are  unreleased   [p, t, k]  at the end of a word.   Plosive stops  /p, t, k/  become nasal stops  [m, n, ]  before nasal stops.   Hangul  spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying, partly historical  morphology . Given this, it is sometimes hard to tell which actual phonemes are present in a certain word.   One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial  [r] , and initial  [n] . For example,     ""labour"" - north:  r odong  (), south:  n odong  ()   ""history"" - north:  ry ksa  (), south:  y eoksa  ()   ""female"" - north:  ny ja  (), south:  y eoja  ()       [ edit ]   Morphophonemics   Grammatical morphemes may change shape depending on the preceding sounds. Examples include  -eun/-neun  (-/-) and  -i/-ga  (-/-). Sometimes sounds may be inserted instead. Examples include  -eul/-reul  (-/-),  -euro/-ro  (-/-),  -eseo/-seo  (-/-),  -ideunji/-deunji  (-/-) and  -iya/-ya  (-/-). However,  -euro/-ro  is somewhat irregular, since it will behave differently after a rieul consonant.     Korean particles     After a consonant   After a rieul   After a vowel       -ui  (-)       -eun  (-)   -neun  (-)       -i  (-)   -ga  (-)       -eul  (-)   -reul  (-)       -gwa  (-)   -wa  (-)       -euro  (-)   -ro  (-)       Some verbs may also change shape morphophonemically.     [ edit ]   Grammar       Main article:  Korean grammar         [ edit ]   Sentence structure   Korean is an  agglutinative language . Modifiers generally follow the modified word, and in the case of verb modifiers, can be serially appended. The basic form of a Korean sentence is  Subject Object Verb , but the verb is the only required and immovable element.       A :       -       -? (?)           gage-e     gasseo-yo           store + [location marker ()]     [go (verb root) ()]+[conjunctive ()]+[past ()]+[conjunctive ()]+ [interrogative marker ()]         ""Did [you] go to the store?"" (with ""you"" implied by context)         B :       .           ne           yes         ""Yes.""       [ edit ]   Parts of speech     [ edit ]   Verb   Korean  verbs  (  ,  dongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""action verbs"" or ""dynamic verbs"" to distinguish them from [  () ,  hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""]), which are also known as ""descriptive verbs"" or ""stative verbs"". Examples of action/dynamic verbs include    ( hada , ""to do, to have"") and    ( gada , ""to go"") which constitute an action or movement as opposed to descriptive verbs such as    ( yehppeuda , ""to be beautiful""). For a larger list of Korean verbs, see  wikt:Category:Korean verbs .   Unlike most of the European languages, Korean does not conjugate verbs using agreement with the subject, and nouns have no gender. Instead, verb conjugations depend upon the verb tense, aspect, mood, and the social relation between the speaker, the subjects, and the listeners. The system of speech levels and honorifics loosely resembles the  T-V distinction  of most  Indo-European languages . For example, different endings are used based on whether the subjects and listeners are friends, parents, or honoured persons.     [ edit ]   Adjective   Words categorized as Korean  adjectives  (  ,  hyeong-yongsa ,   ) conjugate similarly to verbs, so some English texts call them ""descriptive verbs"" or "" stative verbs "", but they are distinctly separate from    ( dongsa ).   English does not have an identical grammatical category, so the English translation of Korean adjectives may misleadingly suggest that they are verbs. For example,    ( bukda ) translates literally as ""to be red"" and    ( aswipda ) often best translates as ""to lack"" or ""to want for"", but both are    ( hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""). For a larger list of Korean adjectives, see  wikt:Category:Korean adjectives .     [ edit ]   Determiner   Korean  determiners  (  ,  gwanhyeongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""determinatives"", ""adnominals"", ""pre-nouns"", ""attributives"", and ""unconjugated adjectives"". Examples include    ( gak , ""each""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean determiners .     [ edit ]   Noun   A large body of Korean  nouns  (  ,  myeongsa ,   ) stem from  Chinese characters , e.g.    (,  san , mountain),    (,  yeok , station),    (,  munhwa , culture), etc. Others are native to the Korean language, e.g.    ( nara , country),    ( nal , day). Many  Sino-Korean words  have a native Korean equivalent and vice versa, but not always. Nouns do not have  grammatical gender  and can be made  plural  by adding  to the end of the word, however in most instances the  singular  form is used even when in English it would be translated as plural. For example, while in English the sentence  ""there are three apples""  would use the plural  ""apples""  instead of the singular  ""apple"" , the Korean sentence    ( sagwa segae isssumnida ) maintains the word  ( sagwa , ""apple"") in its singular form, thus rendered in English as ""apple three(things) exist."" For a list of Korean nouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean nouns .     [ edit ]   Pronoun       Main article:  Korean pronouns       Korean  pronouns  (  ,  daemyeongsa ,   ) are highly influenced by the honorifics in the language. Pronouns change forms depending on the social status of the person or persons spoken to, e.g. the pronoun for ""I"" there is both the informal    ( na ) and the honorific/humble    ( jeo ). In general second person singular pronouns are avoided, especially when using honorific forms. For a larger list or Korean pronouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean pronouns .     [ edit ]   Adverb   Korean  adverbs  (  ,  busa ,   ) include    ( tto , ""also"") and    ( gadeuk , ""fully""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean adverbs .     [ edit ]   Particle   Korean  particles  (  ,  josa ,   ) are also known in English as "" postpositions "". Examples include    ( neun , topic marker) and    ( reul , object marker). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean particles .     [ edit ]   Interjection   Korean  interjections  (  ,  gamtansa ,   ) are also known in English as ""exclamations"". Examples include    ( ani , ""no""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean interjections .     [ edit ]   Number       Main article:  Korean numerals       Korean  numbers  or numerals (  ,  sutja ,   ) consitute two regularly used sets: a native Korean set and a  Sino-Korean  set. The Sino-Korean system is nearly entirely based on the  Chinese numerals . The distinction between the two numeral systems is very important. Everything that can be counted will use one of the two systems, but seldom both. Sino-Korean words are sometimes used to mark ordinal usage: yeol beon ( ) means ""ten times"" while sip beon (() ()) means ""number ten."" The grouping of large numbers in Korean follow the Chinese tradition of myriads (10000) rather than thousands (1000) as is common in Europe and North America.     [ edit ]   Speech levels and honorifics       Main article:  Korean honorifics       The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean, and the grammar reflects this. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject referent is reflected in  honorifics , while that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in  speech level .     [ edit ]   Honorifics   When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a younger stranger, student, employee or the like. Nowadays, there are special endings which can be used on declarative, interrogative, and imperative sentences; and both honorific or normal sentences. They are made for easier and faster use of Korean.     [ edit ]   Speech levels   There are seven verb  paradigms  or  speech levels  in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation. [ citation needed ]  Unlike  honorifics   which are used to show respect towards the referent   speech levels  are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience. The names of the 7 levels are derived from the non-honorific  imperative  form of the verb    ( hada , ""do"") in each level, plus the suffix  ('che',  hanja :   ), which means ""style.""   The highest 6 levels are generally grouped together as  jondaenmal  (), while the lowest level ( haeche , ) is called  banmal  () in Korean.     [ edit ]   Vocabulary   The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words. Like Japanese and Vietnamese, more than 50% of the vocabulary (up to 60% by some estimates), especially words that denote abstract ideas, are  Sino-Korean words , [ 7 ]  either     directly borrowed from  Written Chinese , or   coined in Japan or Korea using  Chinese characters ,     in a similar way European languages borrow from Latin and Greek. Korean has two  number systems : one native, and one borrowed from Chinese.   To a much lesser extent, words have also occasionally been borrowed from  Mongolian ,  Sanskrit , and other languages. Conversely, the Korean language itself has also contributed some loanwords to other languages, most notably the  Tsushima dialect  of Japanese.   The vast majority of loanwords other than Sino-Korean come from modern times, 90% of which are from  English . [ 8 ]  Many words have also been borrowed from  Japanese  and  Western languages  such as  German  ( areubaiteu  part-time job,  allereugi  allergy). Some Western words were borrowed indirectly via Japanese, taking a Japanese sound pattern, for example dozen >     dsu  >     daseu . Most indirect Western borrowings are now written according to current Hangulization rules for the respective Western language, as if borrowed directly. There are a few more complicated borrowings such as German(y) (see  Names for Germany ), the first part of whose  endonym   [d.lant]  the Japanese approximated using the  kanji      doitsu  that were then accepted into the Korean language by their Sino-Korean pronunciation:     dok  +     il  =  Dogil . In South Korean official use, a number of other Sino-Korean country names have been replaced with phonetically oriented Hangulizations of the countries' endonyms or English names.   North Korean vocabulary shows a tendency to prefer native Korean over Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings, especially with recent political objectives aimed at eliminating foreign (mostly Chinese) influences on the Korean language in the North. By contrast, South Korean may have several Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings which tend to be absent in North Korean.     [ edit ]   Writing system       Korean writing systems           Hangul       Hanja       Hyangchal   Gugyeol   Idu       Mixed script       Korean romanization       Revised Romanization of Korean   McCune-Reischauer   Yale Romanization               Main article:  Hangul     See also:  Hangul consonant and vowel tables     In ancient times, the languages of the Korean peninsula were written using  Chinese characters , using  hyangchal  or  idu . Such systems were not popular because hanja is not well suited to the Korean language. Its use is now limited, although the aristocracy prefers  Classical Chinese  for its writing.   Korean is now mainly written in Hangul, the Korean alphabet promulgated in 1446 by  Sejong the Great ;  hanja may be mixed in  to write  Sino-Korean words . South Korea still teaches 1800 hanja characters in its schools, while the North abolished the use of hanja decades ago.   Below is a chart of the Korean alphabet's symbols and their canonical  IPA  values:     Consonants     Hangul                                                                        RR   b , p   d , t   j   g , k   pp   tt   jj   kk   p   t   ch   k   s   h   ss   m   n   ng       r , l           IPA   p   t      k   p   t      k   p   t      k   s   h   s   m   n      w   r   j         Vowels     Hangul                                                                      RR   i   e   oe   ae   a   o   u   eo   eu   ui   ye   yae   ya   yo   yu   yeo   wi   we   wae   wa   wo       IPA   i   e         a   o   u         i   je   j   ja   jo   ju   j   wi   we   w   wa   w       Modern Korean is written with  spaces  between  words , a feature not found in Chinese or Japanese. Korean  punctuation  marks are almost identical to Western ones. Traditionally, Korean was written in columns from top to bottom, right to left, but is now usually written in rows from left to right, top to bottom.     [ edit ]   Differences between North Korean and South Korean       Main article:  Korean language North-South differences       The Korean language used in the North and the South exhibits differences in pronunciation, spelling, grammar and vocabulary. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Pronunciation   In North Korea,  palatalization  of  /si/  is optional, and  //  can be pronounced as  [z]  in between vowels.   Words that are written the same way may be pronounced differently, such as the examples below. The pronunciations below are given in  Revised Romanization ,  McCune-Reischauer  and Hangul, the last of which represents what the Hangul would be if one writes the word as pronounced.       Word   Meaning   Pronunciation       North (RR/MR)   North (Hangul)   South (RR/MR)   South (Hangul)          wide   neo p tta (n p ta)      neo l tta (n l ta)             to read  (continuative form)   i l kko (i l ko)      i l kko (i l ko)             Amnok River   am r okgang (am r okkang)      am n okkang (am n okkang)             independence   dong r ip (tong r ip)      dong n ip (tong n ip)             idea / sense / conception   gwa ll yeom (kwa ll ym)      gwa nn yeom (kwa nn ym)          *   innovative   hyeoksin jj eok (hyksin tch k)      hyeoksin j eok (hyksin j k)          * Similar pronunciation is used in the North whenever the hanja """" is attached to a Sino-Korean word ending in ,  or . (In the South, this rule only applies when it is attached to any single-character Sino-Korean word.)     [ edit ]   Spelling   Some words are spelled differently by the North and the South, but the pronunciations are the same.       Word spelling   Meaning   Pronunciation (RR/MR)   Remarks       North   South             sunshine   haeppit (haepit)   The ""sai siot"" ('' used for indicating sound change) is almost never written out in the North.             cherry blossom   beotkkot (ptkkot)                cannot read   monnikda (monnikta)   Spacing.             Hallasan   hallasan (hallasan)   When a - combination is pronounced as  ll , the original Hangul spelling is kept in the North, while the Hangul is changed in the South.             rules   gyuyul (kyuyul)   In words where the original hanja is spelt """" or """" and follows a vowel, the initial  is not pronounced in the North, making the pronunciation identical with that in the South where the  is dropped in the spelling.         [ edit ]   Spelling and pronunciation   Some words have different spellings and pronunciations in the North and the South, some of which were given in the ""Phonology"" section above:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          ryeongryang (ryngryang)      yeongnyang (yngnyang)   strength   Korean words originally starting in  r  or  n  have their  r  or  n  dropped in the South Korean version if the sound following it is an  i  or  y  sound.          rodong (rodong)      nodong (nodong)   work   Korean words originally starting in  r  have their  r  changed to  n  in the South Korean version if the sound following it is a sound other than  i  or  y .          wonssu (wnssu)      wonsu (wnsu)   mortal enemy   ""Mortal enemy"" and ""head of state"" are homophones in the South. Possibly to avoid referring to  Kim Il-sung  /  Kim Jong-il  as the enemy, the second syllable of ""enemy"" is written and pronounced  in the North.          rajio (rajio)      radio (radio)   radio            u (u)      wi (wi)   on; above            anhae (anhae)      anae (anae)   wife            kkuba (kkuba)      kuba (k'uba)   Cuba   When transcribing foreign words from languages that do not have contrasts between aspirated and unaspirated stops, North Koreans generally use tensed stops for the unaspirated ones while South Koreans use aspirated stops in both cases.          pe (p'e)      pye (p'ye), pe (p'e)   lungs   All hanja pronounced as  pye  ( p'ye ) or  pe  ( p'e ) in the South are pronounced as  pe  ( p'e ) in the North. The spelling is also accordingly different.       In general, when transcribing place names, North Korea tends to use the pronunciation in the original language more than South Korea, which often uses the pronunciation in English. For example:       Original name   North Korea transliteration   English name   South Korea transliteration       Spelling   Pronunciation   Spelling   Pronunciaton       Ulaanbaatar      ullanbattareu (ullanbattar)   Ulan Bator      ullanbatoreu (ullanbat'or)       Kbenhavn      koeppenhabeun (k'oeppenhabn)   Copenhagen      kopenhagen (k'op'enhagen)       al-Qhirah      kkahira (kkahira)   Cairo      kairo (k'airo)         [ edit ]   Grammar   Some grammatical constructions are also different:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          doeyeotda (toeytta)      doeeotda (toetta)   past tense of  (doeda/toeda), ""to become""   All similar grammar forms of verbs or adjectives that end in  in the stem (i.e. , , , ,  and ) in the North use  instead of the South's .          gomawayo (komawayo)      gomawoyo (komawyo)   thanks   -irregular verbs in the North use  (wa) for all those with a positive ending vowel; this only happens in the South if the verb stem has only one syllable.          halgayo (halkayo)      halkkayo (halkkayo)   Shall we do?   Although the Hangul differ, the pronunciations are the same (i.e. with the tensed  sound).         [ edit ]   Vocabulary   Some vocabulary is different between the North and the South:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          munhwajutaek (munhwajut'aek)      apateu (ap'at')   Apartment     (appateu/appat') is also used in the North.          joseonmal (chosnmal)      han-gugeo(han'gugeo)   Korean language            gwakbap (kwakpap)      dosirak (tosirak)   lunch box           [ edit ]   Others   In the North,  guillemets     and    are the symbols used for quotes; in the South, quotation marks equivalent to the English ones,  and , are standard, although     and     are sometimes used in popular novels.     [ edit ]   Study by non-native speakers   The  United States '  Defense Language Institute  classifies Korean alongside  Arabic ,  Chinese , and  Japanese  as a Category IV language, meaning that 63 weeks of instruction (as compared to just 25 weeks for  French ,  Spanish ,  Portuguese , and  Italian ) are required to bring an English-speaking student to a limited working level of proficiency in which he or she has ""sufficient capability to meet routine social demands and limited job requirements"" and ""can deal with concrete topics in past, present, and future tense."" [ 10 ]  As a result, the study of the Korean language in the United States is dominated by  Korean American  heritage language students; they are estimated to form over 80% of all students of the language at non-military universities. [ 11 ]   However, Korean is considerably easier for speakers of certain other languages, such as Japanese, Mongolian and Turkic languages; in Japan, it is more widely studied by non-heritage learners. [ 12 ]  The  Korean Language Proficiency Test , an examination aimed at assessing non-native speakers' competence in Korean, was instituted in 1997; 17,000 people applied for the 2005 sitting of the examination.

The language is also spoken widely in neighbouring   Yanbian ,   China .  Worldwide, there are around 78 million Korean speakers, including large groups in the former   Soviet Union , the   United States ,   Canada ,   Brazil  and   Japan . Proper  classification  of Korean is not universally agreed on, but it is often considered by many to be a   language isolate . Some linguists instead group it in the   Altaic  family of languages. The native Korean writing systemalled   Hangul s   syllabic  and phonetic.    Sino-Korean  characters (  Hanja Hanja (lit. Han character(s , or Hanmun (; ), sometimes translated as Sino-Korean characters are what Chinese characters (Hanzi) are called in Korean, but specifically, they refer to those that the Korean language borrowed and incorporated into their own ) are also used in writing.  While the most commonly used words in the language are of native Korean origin, well over 50% of the language's vocabulary consists of words composed from   Hanja Hanja (lit. Han character(s , or Hanmun (; ), sometimes translated as Sino-Korean characters are what Chinese characters (Hanzi) are called in Korean, but specifically, they refer to those that the Korean language borrowed and incorporated into their own .  Korean is   agglutinative An agglutinative language is a language in which the words are formed by joining morphemes together. This term was introduced by Wilhelm von Humboldt in 1836 to classify languages from a morphological point of view. It was derived from the Latin verb aggl  in its word formation and   SOV Subject Object Verb (SOV) is a term used in linguistic typology to state the general order of words in a language's sentences: ""Sam oranges ate"". The SOV type is the most common type found in natural languages. It corresponds roughly to reverse Polish not  in its syntax.

The Korean names for the language are based on the   names for Korea  used in South and North Korea.    In South Korea, Korea is called ""Hanguk"" (In   Hangul : 한국).  There and outside of Korea, the language is most often called ""Hangungmal"" (한국말), or more formally, ""Hangugeo"" (한국어).  The language is also sometimes referred to colloquially as ""Urimal"" (우리말; ""our language"").  The standard language taught in schools is often referred to as ""Gugeo"" (국어; ""national language"").  In North Korea, Korea is called ""Choson"" (조선), and the language is most often called ""Chosonmal"" (조선말) or more formally, ""Chosono"" (조선어).  Korea was also called ""Choson"" (""Chosen"" in   Japanese ) during the   Japanese Colonial Period  (  1910 -  1945 ), and so many important linguistic works written during that period also refer to the language by the names ""Chosono"" or ""Chosonmal.""    2 History   The native written script,   Hangul , was devised in 1446, under the decree of   King Sejong .    Hanja  has also been used extensively since the early first millennium, mainly to represent   Sino-Korean  words, but also in the period before the introduction of Hangul, to represent words of native Korean origin.    3 Classification and related languages   Korean is often classified as being a separate language in a family of its own (a   language isolate ). In addition, most Korean and some Western linguists recognize Korean's kinship to the   Altaic languages . On the other hand, traditional Western (since the 18th century) and many Japanese linguists believe that Korea has genetic relationship with   Japanese .  In Korea, the possibility of Korean-Japanese linguistic relationship has been ignored mostly; the often strained relations between the two countries throughout history tend to make any discussion of a relationship between their languages a controversial one. However, the Korean relationship with   Altaic  and proto-Altaic also have been much argued as of late. It does bear some   morphological  resemblance to some languages of the Eastern Turkic group, namely,   Yakut  and some of its variants, and some linguists believe that Altaic itself forms part of a larger   Ural-Altaic  language family. The opponents of this view believe that much of the   Altaic  influences in the language was infused later in Korean history during the Mongol rule over Korea during the   Goryeo  dynasty.    4 Geographic distribution   5 Dialects     Main article:    }   (under construction)   Korean has several   dialect s (called  mal  (literally speech),  bang-eon , or  saturi  in Korean). The   standard language  ( Pyojuneo  or  Pyojunmal ) of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around   Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around   P'yongyang . These dialects are similar, and in fact all dialects except that of   Jeju  Island are largely mutually intelligible. The dialect spoken there is classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of  Seoul Dialect  use stress very little, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of  Gyeongsang Dialect  have a very pronounced intonation that makes their dialect sound more like a European language to western ears.  There is a very close connection between the dialects of Korean and the   regions of Korea , since the boundaries of both are largely determined by mountains and seas.

The symbol [ is used to denote the tensed consonants ([p, [t, [c, [k, and [s) but its official   IPA  usage is for   ejective  consonants, which the tensed stops in Korean are not. The tensed stops are produced with a partially constricted   glottis  and additional subglottal pressure.    6.2 Vowels       6.3 Monophthongs   Korean has 8 different vowel qualities and a length distinction. The close-mid front rounded vowel [ can still be heard in the speech of some older speakers, but it has largely been replaced by the diphthong [we]. Similarly, the length distinction for all vowels can still be heard from older speakers, but it is no longer made by most younger speakers.           i     siˈɟan     sijang     'hunger'     iː     ˈsiːɟan     sijang     'market'           e     peˈɡɛ     begae     'pillow'     eː     ˈpeːda     beda     'to cut'           ɛ     tʰɛˈjan     taeyang     'sun'     ɛː     ˈtʰɛːdo     taedo     'attitude'           a     ˈmal     mal     'horse'     aː     ˈmaːl     mal     'speech'           o     poˈli     bori     'barley'     oː     ˈpoːsu     bosu     'salary'           u     kuˈli     guri     'copper'     uː     ˈsuːbak     subak     'watermelon'           ʌ     ˈpʌl     beol     'punishment'     ʌː     ˈpʌːl     beol     'bee'           ɯ     ˈʌːlɯn     eoreun     'seniors'     ɯː     ˈɯːmsik     eumsik     'food'         6.4 Diphthongs and glides   [j] and [w] are considered to be components of diphthongs rather than separate consonant phonemes.         /td> /td> /td> /td>        wi dwi dwi 'back'         ɯi' ˈɯisa uiza 'doctor'      je ˈjeːsan yesan 'budget'         we kwe gwe 'box'         /td> /td> /td> /td>      jɛ ˈjɛːki yaegi 'story'         wɛ wɛ wae 'why'         /td> /td> /td> /td>      ja ˈjaːgu yagu 'baseball'         wa kwaːˈil kwa-il 'fruits'         /td> /td> /td> /td>      jo ˈkjoːs gyosa 'teacher'         /td> /td> /td> /td>        /td> /td> /td> /td>      ju juˈli yuri 'glass'         /td> /td> /td> /td>        /td> /td> /td> /td>      jʌ jʌːgi yeogi 'here'         wʌ mwʌ mwo 'what'         /td> /td> /td> /td>     Source:  Handbook of the International Phonetic Association     6.5 Phonology   [s] becomes palatalized as [ʃ] or [ɕ] before [j] or [i].  [h] becomes labialized [ɸ] before [o] and [u] and palatalized [ before [i] or [j]  [p], [t], [c], and [k] become voiced [b], [d], [ɟ], and [ɡ] between   sonorant  segments.  [l] becomes alveolar flap [ɾ] between   sonorant  segments, such as between two   vowel s.  Phonetic rules, mostly   assimilation , transform the pronunciation of some words. For example,       Jong l o  is pronounced as  Jong n o     Han k u k mal  as  Han- g u ng mal     Stop consonants are generally voiceless, but lightly aspirated stops become voiced and unaspirated in intervocalic position. For example,     p -> b   t -> d   k -> g    Stops are nasalized before a nasal. For example,     p -> m (before m, n, or ng)   t -> n (before m, n, or ng)   k -> ng (before m, n, or ng)    One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial [r]. For example,     勞動 north:  r odong , south:  n odong  (labour)   鴨綠江 north:  Am r okgang , south:  Am n okgang  (name of a River)   心理學 north:  shim r ihak , south:  shim n ihak  (psychology)     Hangul  spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying   morphology .   7 Grammar   Korean is an   agglutinative language . The basic form of a Korean sentence is Subject-Object-Verb (  SOV ), and modifiers precede the modified word. Accordingly, whereas in English, one would say, ""I'm going to the store to buy some food,” in Korean it would be: *""I food to-buy in-order-to store-to going-am.""  In Korean, ""unnecessary"" words (see   theme and rheme ) can be left out of a sentence as long as the context makes the meaning clear. A typical exchange might translate word-for word to the following:    H: ""가게에 가세요?"" ( gage-e gaseyo? )  G: ""예."" ( ye. )      H: *""store-to going?""  G: ""yes.""      which in English would translate to:    H: ""Are you going to the store?""  G: ""Yes.""      Unlike Romance languages, Korean does not conjugate verbs using agreement with the subject, and nouns have no gender. Instead, verb conjugations depend upon the verb tense and on the relation between the people speaking. When talking to or about friends, you would use one conjugate ending, to your parents, another, and to nobility/honoured persons, another. This loosely echoes the   T-V distinction  of most   Indo-European languages .    8  Speech Levels and Honorifics    The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean, and the grammar reflects this. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject is reflected in  honorifics , while that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in  speech level .    8.1 Honorifics   When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer to use special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older distant relative (grandparent's sibling, older sibling's spouse, etc.), a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a close relative (grandparent, parent, spouse, or sibling), younger stranger, student, employee or the like. On rare occasions (like when someone wants to pick a fight), a speaker might speak to a superior or stranger in a way normally only used for, say, animals, but no one would do this without seriously considering the consequences to their physical safety first!  One way of using honorifics is to use  special nouns  in place of regular nouns with ""honorific"" ones. A common example is using  jinji  instead of  bap  for ""food"". More often, special nouns are used when speaking about relatives. Thus, the speaker/writer may address his own grandmother as  halmeoni  but refer to someone else's grandmother as  halmeonim . (The  m  comes from the honorific suffix  -nim  (님), which is affixed to many kinship terms to make them honorific; thus,  hyeongnim  is the formal term for an older sibling of the same sex (derived from  hyeong,  the informal term for man's older brother;  eonni  is the informal term for a woman's older sister).  All verbs can be converted into an honorific form by adding the infix  -si-  (시, pronounced  shi ) after the   stem  and before the verb  ending . Thus,  gada  (""go"") becomes  gasida . A few verbs have special honorific equivalents. Therefore  gyesida  is the honorific form of  itda  (""exist"");  japsusida  is the honorific form of  meokda  (""eat""); and  jumusida  is the honorific form of  jada  (""sleep"").  A few verbs have special humble forms, used when the speaker is referring to him/herself in polite situations. These include  deurida  and  ollida  for  juda  (""give"").  Deurida  is substituted for  juda  when the latter is used as an   auxiliary  verb, while  ollida --which literally means ""raise up""--is used for  juda  in the sense of ""offer"".  Pronouns in Korean have their own set of polite equivalents: thus,  jeo  is the humble form of  na  (""I"");  jeoheui  is the humble form of  uri  (""we""); and  dangsin  (""friend,"" but only used as a form of address and more polite than ""chingu"", the usual word for ""friend""; also, whereas uses of other humble forms are straightforward, ""dangsin"" must be used only in specific social contexts, such as between two married couple--""dangsin"" can often be used in ironic sense when used between strangers) is the honorific form of  neo  (""you"" (singular). Note: in general, Koreans avoid using second person singular pronoun, especially when using honorific forms, and either i) use the person's name or title in place of ""you"" in English, or ii) use plural ""ieoreobun"" where applicable).    8.2 Speech Levels   There are no fewer than 7 verb   paradigm s or  speech levels  in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation. Unlike  honorifics --which are used to show respect towards a subject-- speech levels  are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience. The names of the 7 levels are derived from the non-honorific   imperative  form of the verb  hada  (""do"") in each level, plus the suffix   che , which means ""body.""  The highest 5 levels use   final  verb  ending s, while the lowest 2 levels ( haeyoche ) and ( haeche ) use  non-final   ending s and are called  banmal  (""half-words"") in Korean. (The  haeyoche  in turn is formed by simply adding the non-final ending  yo  (요) to the  haeche  form of the verb.)  Taken together, honorifics and speech levels form a   cartesian product  of 14 basic verb stems. Here is a table giving the 7 levels, the   present   indicative  form of the verb  hada  (하다; ""do"" in English) in each level in both its honorific and non-honorific forms, and the situations in which each level is used.      Speech Level Non-Honorific Present Indicative of ""hada"" Honorific Present Indicative of ""hada"" Level of Formality When Used   Hasoseoche (하소서체) hanaida (하나이다) hashinaida (하시나이다) Extremely formal and polite Traditionally used when addressing a king, queen, or high official; now used only in historical dramas and the Bible   Hapshoche (합쇼체) hamnida (합니다) hashimnida (하십니다) Formal and polite Used commonly between strangers, among male co-workers, by TV announcers, and to customers   Haoche (하오체) hao (하오) hasho (하쇼), hashio (하시오) Formal, of neutral politeness Only used nowadays among some older people   Hageche (하게체) hane (하네) hashine (하시네) Formal, of neutral politeness Generally only used by some older people when addressing younger people, friends, or relatives   Haerache (해라체) handa (한다) hashinda (하신다) Formal, of neutral politeness or impolite Used to close friends, relatives of similar age, or younger people; also used almost universally in books, newspapers, and magazines; also used in reported speech (""She said that..."")   Haeyoche (해요체) haeyo (해요) haseyo (하세요) (common), hasheoyo (하셔요) (rare) Informal and polite Used mainly between strangers, especially those older or of equal age. Traditionally used more by women than men, though in   Seoul  many men prefer this form to the Hapshoche (see above).   Haeche (해체) hae (해) (in speech), hayeo (하여) (in writing) hasheo(하셔) Informal, of neutral politeness or impolite Used most often between close friends and relatives, and when addressing younger people. It is  never  used between strangers unless the speaker wants to pick a fight.     9 Vocabulary   The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words. More than 50% of the vocabulary, however, is made up of   Hanja  (  Sino-Korean ) words, which are derived from   Chinese character s. To a much lesser extent, words have also been borrowed from   Mongolian ,   Sanskrit , and other languages. In modern times, many words have also been borrowed from   Western languages  such as   German  and, more recently,   English .  The numbers are a good example of borrowing. Like   Japanese , Korean has two number systemsne native and one borrowed from the Chineseo Korean, Chinese, Japanese, and some other languages such as   Thai  all appear to have similar words for numbers.    10 Writing system   Main article:   Hangul   The Korean language was originally written using ""  Hanja "", or   Chinese character s; it is now mainly written in   Hangul , the Korean alphabet, optionally mixing in Hanja to write   Sino-Korean  words. Hangul consists of 24 letters -- 14 consonants and 10 vowels that are written in blocks of 2 to 5 characters. Unlike the   Chinese  writing system (including   Japanese    Kanji ), Hangul is not an   ideographic  system. The shapes of the individual Hangul letters were designed to model the physical morphology of the tongue, palate and teeth; up to five letters join to form a syllabic unit.  Below is a chart of the Korean alphabet's symbols and their canonical   SAMPA  values:        Consonants       p   t    c   k           ᄇ   ᄃ   ᄌ   ᄀ           p/TD>  t/TD>  c/TD>  k/TD>          ᄈ   ᄄ   ᄍ   ᄁ           p h   t h   c h   k h           ᄑ   ᄐ   ᄎ   ᄏ           /TD>  s   /TD>  h           /TD>  ᄉ   /TD>  ᄒ           /TD>  s/TD>  /TD>  /TD>          /TD>  ᄊ   /TD>  /TD>          m   n   /TD>  N           ᄆ   ᄂ   /TD>  ᄋ           w   r   j   /TD>          (n/a)   ᄅ   (n/a)   /TD>          Vowels       i   e   }   a   o   u   7   M            ᅵ   ᅦ   ᅢ   ᅡ   ᅩ   ᅮ   ᅥ   ᅳ            Mi   je   j}   ja   jo   ju   j7   /TD>           ᅴ   ᅨ   ᅤ   ᅣ   ᅭ   ᅲ   ᅧ   /TD>           ui   ue   o}   oa   /TD>  /TD>  u7   /TD>           ᅱ   ᅰ   ᅫ   ᅪ   /TD>  /TD>  ᅯ   /TD>           (See also:   Hangul consonant tables )  Modern Korean is written with   space s between   word s, a feature not found in the other   CJK  languages (Chinese and Japanese). Korean   punctuation  marks are almost identical to Western ones. Traditionally, Korean was written in columns from top to bottom, right to left, much as in other East Asian cultures. Korean is still sometimes written in columns (especially in poetry), but is now usually written in rows from left to right, top to bottom.

In the 15th century a national writing system was developed by  Sejong the Great , nowadays called  Hangul .   The genealogical  classification  of the Korean language is debated.

In South Korea, the language is most often called  Hangungmal  (  ;   ), or more formally,  Hangugeo  (  ;   ) or  Gugeo  (  ;   ; literally ""national language"").   In North Korea and Yanbian in China, the language is most often called  Chosnmal  (  ; with  hanja :   ), or more formally,  Chosn  (  ;   ).   On the other hand, Korean people in the  former USSR , who refer to themselves as  Koryo-saram  (also  Goryeoin  [  ;   ; literally, "" Goryeo  person(s)""]) call the language  Goryeomal  (  ;   ).   In  mainland China , following the establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992, the term  Choxiny  (   or short form:  Choy  (  )) has normally been used to refer to the language spoken in North Korea and Yanbian, while  Hnguy  (   or short form:  Hny  (  )) is used to refer to the language spoken in South Korea.   Some older English sources also used the name ""Korean"" to refer to the language, country, and people.     [ edit ]   History   Main article:  History of the Korean language   Korean is descended from  Old Korean  and  Middle Korean .     [ edit ]   Classification   The classification of the modern Korean language is uncertain, and due to the lack of any one generally accepted theory, it is sometimes described conservatively as a  language isolate .   On the other hand, since the publication of the article of  Ramstedt  in 1926, many linguists support the hypothesis that Korean can be classified as an  Altaic  language, or as a relative of proto-Altaic. Korean is similar to Altaic languages in that they both lack certain grammatical elements, including  number ,  gender ,  articles , fusional morphology, voice, and  relative pronouns  (Kim Namkil). Korean especially bears some  morphological  resemblance to some languages of the Northern Turkic group, namely  Sakha (Yakut) . Vinokurova, a scholar of the Sakha language, noted that like in Korean, and unlike in other  Turkic languages  or a variety of other languages surveyed, adverbs in Sakha are derived from verbs with the help of derivational morphology; however, she did not suggest this implied any relation between the two languages. [ 2 ]   It is also considered likely that Korean is related in some way to  Japanese , since the two languages have nearly identical grammatical structures, and share a number of possible phonological cognates (though a majority of them are likely due to local pronunciations of the Chinese characters from which they are derived), as noted by such researchers as  Samuel E. Martin  and  Roy Andrew Miller  in the late 1960s.  Sergei Starostin  (1991) found about 25% of potential cognates in the Japanese-Korean 100-word  Swadesh list , which places these two languages closer together than other possible members of the Altaic family. [ 3 ]   Genetic relationships have been postulated both directly and indirectly, the latter either through placing both languages in the Altaic family, or by arguing for a relationship between Japanese and the  Buyeo languages  of  Goguryeo  and  Baekje  (see below); the proposed Baekje relationship is supported by cognates such as Baekje  mir , Japanese  mi-  ""three"". [ 4 ]   The possible relationship between Korean and Japanese can be exemplified by such basic vocabularly items as J.     mizu  (Old J.  midu ) : K.     mul  (Middle K.  mirh ) ""water"",  mot  ""lake""; J.     ku-ru  ""come"" (Old J.  ku , also cf. irregular root changes as in past tense   ki-ta , negative   ko-nai  in Modern J.) : K.     ka-da  (""go""); J.     kata-i  ""hard"" (whence     kata-na  ""knife, sword"") : K.  kud-yn  (hard); J.     i-ru  ""to be"" (past tense   i-ta ) : K.     i-da  ""to be""; J.  na ,  -en  : K.  anh  ""not"", J.  minna  (Old J.  mynna ) ""all, everyone"" : K.  manh-  ""many"" (predicate  mana-da ), etc.  [ 5 ] . The same possible cognates are often observed in other members of the potential  Altaic family , esp. in the  Tungusic languages . Cf. Nanay  mue  ""water"",  giagda-  ""to walk"",  anaa, anna  ""not"".   Others argue, however, that the similarities are not due to any genetic relationship, but rather to a  sprachbund  effect. [ citation needed ]  See  East Asian languages  for morphological features shared among languages of the East Asian  sprachbund , and  Classification of Japanese  for further details on the possible relationship. Though it is very difficult to believe words such as ""water"", ""to be"", and ""to go"" arise from sprachbund effects.   It is presumed that modern Korean may be more closely related to the languages of  Samhan  and  Silla  than the Buyeo languages; many Korean scholars believe they were mutually intelligible, and the collective basis of what in the  Goryeo  period would merge to become Middle Korean (the language before the changes that the  Seven-Year War  brought) and eventually Modern Korean. The  Jeju dialect  preserves some archaic features that can also be found in Middle Korean, whose  arae a  is retained in the dialect as a distinct vowel.   There are also more marginal hypotheses proposing various other relationships; for example, a few scholars, such as  Homer B. Hulbert  (1905), have tried to relate Korean to the  Dravidian languages  through the similar syntax in both. [ 6 ]   Though not related to Chinese, it has borrowed heavily; see the Vocabulary section below.     [ edit ]   Dialects   Main article:  Korean dialects          Dialects of Korean       Korean has several  dialects  (called  mal  [literally ""speech""],  saturi , or  bang-eon  in Korean). The  standard language  ( pyojuneo  or  pyojunmal ) of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  P'yngyang . All dialects of Korean are similar to each other, and are in fact all mutually intelligible, perhaps with the exception of the dialect of  Jeju Island  (see  Jeju dialect ). The dialect spoken in Jeju is in fact classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of  Seoul dialect  use very little stress, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of the  Gyeongsang dialect  have a very pronounced intonation.   It is also worth noting that there is substantial evidence for a history of extensive  dialect levelling , or even  convergent evolution  or intermixture of two or more originally distinct linguistic stocks, within the Korean language and its dialects. Many Korean dialects have basic vocabulary that is etymologically distinct from vocabulary of identical meaning in Standard Korean or other dialects, such as South Jeolla dialect /kur/ vs. Standard Korean     /ip/  ""mouth"" or Gyeongsang dialect  /.u.i/  vs. Standard Korean  /puu/  "" garlic chives ."" This suggests that the Korean Peninsula may have at one time been much more linguistically diverse than it is at present. See also the  Buyeo languages   hypothesis .   There is a very close connection between the dialects of Korean and the  regions of Korea , since the boundaries of both are largely determined by mountains and seas. Here is a list of traditional dialect names and locations:       Standard dialect   Where used       Seoul   Seoul  (),  Incheon  (/), most of  Gyeonggi  (/)       P'yngan  (/)   P'yngyang ,  P'yngan  region,  Chagang  (North Korea)       Regional dialect   Where used       Gyeonggi   limited areas of the  Gyeonggi  region (South Korea)       Chungcheong   Daejeon ,  Chungcheong  region (South Korea)       Gangwon   Gangwon-do (South Korea) / Kangwn (North Korea)       Gyeongsang   Busan ,  Daegu ,  Ulsan ,  Gyeongsang  region (South Korea)       Hamgyng   Rasn ,  Hamgyng  region,  Ryanggang  (North Korea)       Hwanghae   Hwanghae  region (North Korea)       Jeju   Jeju Island/Province  (South Korea)       Jeolla   Gwangju ,  Jeolla  region (South Korea)         [ edit ]   Phonology       This article contains  IPA  phonetic symbols.

Main article:  Korean phonology     [ edit ]   Consonants          The Korean consonants             Bilabial   Alveolar   Post-  alveolar   Velar   Glottal       Nasal      /m/      /n/        //  (syllable-final)         Plosive  and   Affricate   plain      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         tense      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         aspirated      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         Fricative   plain        /s/          /h/       tense        /s/             Liquid        /l/           The  IPA  symbol <  > (a subscript double straight quotation mark, shown here with a placeholder circle) is used to denote the tensed consonants  /p/, /t/, /k/, //, /s/ . Its official use in the  Extensions to the IPA  is for  'strong'  articulation, but is used in the literature for  faucalized voice . The Korean consonants also have elements of  stiff voice , but it is not yet known how typical this is of faucalized consonants. They are produced with a partially constricted  glottis  and additional subglottal pressure in addition to tense vocal tract walls, laryngeal lowering, or other expansion of the larynx.     [ edit ]   Vowels                    The Korean basic vowels                 Monophthongs   /i/    ,  /e/    ,  //    ,  /a/    ,  /o/    ,  /u/    ,  //    ,  //    ,  //          Vowels preceded by intermediaries,  or Diphthongs   /je/    ,  /j/    ,  /ja/    ,  /wi/    ,  /we/    ,  /w/    ,  /wa/    ,  /i/    ,  /jo/    ,  /ju/    ,  /j/    ,  /w/            [ edit ]   Allophones   /s/  becomes an  alveolo-palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i]  for most speakers (but see  Differences in the language between North Korea and South Korea ). This occurs with the tense fricative and all the affricates as well. At the end of a syllable, /s/ changes to /t/ (Example: beoseot () 'mushroom').   /h/  may become a  bilabial   []  before  [o]  or  [u] , a  palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i] , a  velar   [x]  before  [] , a voiced  []  between voiced sounds, and a  [h]  elsewhere. [ citation needed ]   /p, t, , k/  become voiced  [b, d, , ]  between voiced sounds.   /l/  becomes alveolar flap  []  between vowels, and  [l]  or  []  at the end of a syllable or next to another  /l/ . Note that a written syllable-final '', when followed by a vowel or a glide ( i.e. , when the next character starts with ''), migrates to the next syllable and thus becomes  [] .   Traditionally,  /l/  was disallowed at the beginning of a word. It disappeared before  [j] , and otherwise became  /n/ . However, the inflow of western loanword changed the trend, and now word-initial  /l/  (mostly from English loanwords) are pronounced as a free variation of either  []  or  [l] . The traditional prohibition of word-initial  /l/  became a morphological rule called ""initial law"" () in South Korea, which pertains to Sino-Korean vocabulary. Such words retain their word-initial  /l/  in North Korea.   All  obstruents  (plosives, affricates, fricatives) are  unreleased   [p, t, k]  at the end of a word.   Plosive stops  /p, t, k/  become nasal stops  [m, n, ]  before nasal stops.   Hangul  spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying, partly historical  morphology . Given this, it is sometimes hard to tell which actual phonemes are present in a certain word.   One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial  [r] , and initial  [n] . For example,     ""labour"" - north:  r odong  (), south:  n odong  ()   ""history"" - north:  ry ksa  (), south:  y eoksa  ()   ""female"" - north:  ny ja  (), south:  y eoja  ()       [ edit ]   Morphophonemics   Grammatical morphemes may change shape depending on the preceding sounds. Examples include  -eun/-neun  (-/-) and  -i/-ga  (-/-). Sometimes sounds may be inserted instead. Examples include  -eul/-reul  (-/-),  -euro/-ro  (-/-),  -eseo/-seo  (-/-),  -ideunji/-deunji  (-/-) and  -iya/-ya  (-/-). However,  -euro/-ro  is somewhat irregular, since it will behave differently after a rieul consonant.

[ edit ]   Grammar   Main article:  Korean grammar     [ edit ]   Sentence structure   Korean is an  agglutinative language . Modifiers generally follow the modified word, and in the case of verb modifiers, can be serially appended. The basic form of a Korean sentence is  Subject Object Verb , but the verb is the only required and immovable element.       A :       -       -? (?)           kage-e     kasseo-yo           store + [location marker ()]     [go (verb root) ()]+[conjunctive ()]+[past ()]+[conjunctive ()]+ [polite marker ()]         ""Did [you] go to the store?"" (with ""you"" implied by context)         B :       .           ne           yes         ""Yes.""       [ edit ]   Parts of speech     [ edit ]   Verb   Korean  verbs  (  ,  tongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""action verbs"" or ""dynamic verbs"" to distinguish them from [  () ,  hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""]), which are also known as ""descriptive verbs"" or ""stative verbs"". Examples of action/dynamic verbs include    ( hada , ""to do"") and    ( kada , ""to go"") which constitute an action or movement as opposed to descriptive verbs such as    ( yehppeuda , ""to be beautiful""). For a larger list of Korean verbs, see  wikt:Category:Korean verbs .   Unlike most of the European languages, Korean does not conjugate verbs using agreement with the subject, and nouns have no gender. Instead, verb conjugations depend upon the verb tense, aspect, mood, and the social relation between the speaker, the subjects, and the listeners. The system of speech levels and honorifics loosely resembles the  T-V distinction  of most  Indo-European languages . For example, different endings are used based on the speaker's relation with the person they are talking to or the person about which they are talking. Politeness is a critical part of Korean language and Korean culture, therefore, when talking to someone esteemed, the correct verb ending, which should have a lot of respect, must be chosen.     [ edit ]   Adjective   Words categorized as Korean  adjectives  (  ,  hyeong-yongsa ,   ) conjugate similarly to verbs, so some English texts call them ""descriptive verbs"" or "" stative verbs "", but they are distinctly separate from    ( tongsa ).   English does not have an identical grammatical category, so the English translation of Korean adjectives may misleadingly suggest that they are verbs. For example,    ( pukda ) translates literally as ""to be red"" and    ( aswipda ) often best translates as ""to lack"" or ""to want for"", but both are    ( hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""). For a larger list of Korean adjectives, see  wikt:Category:Korean adjectives .     [ edit ]   Determiner   Korean  determiners  (  ,  gwanhyeongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""determinatives"", ""adnominals"", ""pre-nouns"", ""attributives"", and ""unconjugated adjectives"". Examples include    ( kak , ""each""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean determiners .     [ edit ]   Noun   A large body of Korean  nouns  (  ,  myeongsa ,   ) stem from  Chinese characters , e.g.    (,  san , mountain),    (,  yeok , station),    (,  munhwa , culture), etc. Others are native to the Korean language, e.g.    ( nara , country),    ( nal , day). Many  Sino-Korean words  have a native Korean equivalent and vice versa, but not always. Nouns do not have  grammatical gender  and can be made  plural  by adding  to the end of the word, however in most instances the  singular  form is used even when in English it would be translated as plural. For example, while in English the sentence  ""there are three apples""  would use the plural  ""apples""  instead of the singular  ""apple"" , the Korean sentence    ( sagwa segae isssumnida ) maintains the word  ( sagwa , ""apple"") in its singular form, thus rendered in English as ""apple three(things) exist."" For a list of Korean nouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean nouns .     [ edit ]   Pronoun   Main article:  Korean pronouns   Korean  pronouns  (  ,  daemyeongsa ,   ) are highly influenced by the honorifics in the language. Pronouns change forms depending on the social status of the person or persons spoken to, e.g. the pronoun for ""I"" there is both the informal    ( na ) and the honorific/humble    ( jeo ). In general second person singular pronouns are avoided, especially when using honorific forms. For a larger list or Korean pronouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean pronouns .     [ edit ]   Adverb   Korean  adverbs  (  ,  busa ,   ) include    ( tto , ""also"") and    ( gadeuk , ""fully""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean adverbs .     [ edit ]   Particle   Korean  particles  (  ,  josa ,   ) are also known in English as "" postpositions "". Examples include    ( neun , topic marker) and    ( reul , object marker). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean particles .     [ edit ]   Interjection   Korean  interjections  (  ,  gamtansa ,   ) are also known in English as ""exclamations"". Examples include    ( ani , ""no""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean interjections .     [ edit ]   Number   Main article:  Korean numerals   Korean  numbers  or numerals (  ,  sutja ,   ) consitute two regularly used sets: a native Korean set and a  Sino-Korean  set. The Sino-Korean system is nearly entirely based on the  Chinese numerals . The distinction between the two numeral systems is very important. Everything that can be counted will use one of the two systems, but seldom both. Sino-Korean words are sometimes used to mark ordinal usage: yeol beon ( ) means ""ten times"" while sip beon (() ()) means ""number ten."" The grouping of large numbers in Korean follow the Chinese tradition of myriads (10000) rather than thousands (1000) as is common in Europe and North America.     [ edit ]   Speech levels and honorifics   Main article:  Korean honorifics   The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean, and the grammar reflects this. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject referent is reflected in  honorifics , while that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in  speech level .     [ edit ]   Honorifics   When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a younger stranger, student, employee or the like. Nowadays, there are special endings which can be used on declarative, interrogative, and imperative sentences; and both honorific or normal sentences. They are made for easier and faster use of Korean.     [ edit ]   Speech levels   There are seven verb  paradigms  or  speech levels  in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation. [ citation needed ]  Unlike  honorifics   which are used to show respect towards the referent   speech levels  are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience. The names of the 7 levels are derived from the non-honorific  imperative  form of the verb    ( hada , ""do"") in each level, plus the suffix  ('che',  hanja :   ), which means ""style.""   The highest 6 levels are generally grouped together as  jondaenmal  (), while the lowest level ( haeche , ) is called  banmal  () in Korean.     [ edit ]   Vocabulary   The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words. Like Japanese and Vietnamese, more than 50% of the vocabulary (up to 60% by some estimates), especially words that denote abstract ideas, are  Sino-Korean words , [ 7 ]  either     directly borrowed from  Written Chinese , or   coined in Japan or Korea using  Chinese characters ,     in a similar way European languages borrow from Latin and Greek. Korean has two  number systems : one native, and one borrowed from Chinese.   To a much lesser extent, words have also occasionally been borrowed from  Mongolian ,  Sanskrit , and other languages. Conversely, the Korean language itself has also contributed some loanwords to other languages, most notably the  Tsushima dialect  of Japanese.   The vast majority of loanwords other than Sino-Korean come from modern times, 90% of which are from  English . [ 8 ]  Many words have also been borrowed from  Japanese  and  Western languages  such as  German  ( areubaiteu  part-time job,  allereugi  allergy). Some Western words were borrowed indirectly via Japanese, taking a Japanese sound pattern, for example dozen >     dsu  >     daseu . Most indirect Western borrowings are now written according to current Hangulization rules for the respective Western language, as if borrowed directly. There are a few more complicated borrowings such as German(y) (see  Names for Germany ), the first part of whose  endonym   [d.lant]  the Japanese approximated using the  kanji      doitsu  that were then accepted into the Korean language by their Sino-Korean pronunciation:     dok  +     il  =  Dogil . In South Korean official use, a number of other Sino-Korean country names have been replaced with phonetically oriented Hangulizations of the countries' endonyms or English names.   North Korean vocabulary shows a tendency to prefer native Korean over Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings, especially with recent political objectives aimed at eliminating foreign (mostly Chinese) influences on the Korean language in the North. By contrast, South Korean may have several Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings which tend to be absent in North Korean.     [ edit ]   Writing system       Korean writing systems           Hangul       Hanja       Hyangchal   Gugyeol   Idu       Mixed script       Korean romanization       Revised Romanization of Korean   McCune-Reischauer   Yale Romanization           Main article:  Hangul   See also:  Hangul consonant and vowel tables   In ancient times, the languages of the Korean peninsula were written using  Chinese characters , using  hyangchal  or  idu . Such systems were not popular because hanja is not well suited to the Korean language. Its use is now limited.   Korean is now mainly written in Hangul, the Korean alphabet promulgated in 1446 by  Sejong the Great ;  hanja may be mixed in  to write  Sino-Korean words . South Korea still teaches 1800 hanja characters in its schools, while the North abolished the use of hanja decades ago.   Below is a chart of the Korean alphabet's symbols and their canonical  IPA  values:     Consonants     Hangul                                                                        RR   b , p   d , t   j   g , k   pp   tt   jj   kk   p   t   ch   k   s   h   ss   m   n   ng       r , l           IPA   p   t      k   p   t      k   p   t      k   s   h   s   m   n      w   r   j         Vowels     Hangul                                                                      RR   i   e   oe   ae   a   o   u   eo   eu   ui   ye   yae   ya   yo   yu   yeo   wi   we   wae   wa   wo       IPA   i   e         a   o   u         i   je   j   ja   jo   ju   j   wi   we   w   wa   w       Modern Korean is written with  spaces  between  words , a feature not found in Chinese or Japanese. Korean  punctuation  marks are almost identical to Western ones. Traditionally, Korean was written in columns from top to bottom, right to left, but is now usually written in rows from left to right, top to bottom.     [ edit ]   Differences between North Korean and South Korean   Main article:  Korean language North-South differences   The Korean language used in the North and the South exhibits differences in pronunciation, spelling, grammar and vocabulary. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Pronunciation   In North Korea,  palatalization  of  /si/  is optional, and  //  can be pronounced as  [z]  in between vowels.   Words that are written the same way may be pronounced differently, such as the examples below. The pronunciations below are given in  Revised Romanization ,  McCune-Reischauer  and Hangul, the last of which represents what the Hangul would be if one writes the word as pronounced.       Word   Meaning   Pronunciation       North (RR/MR)   North (Hangul)   South (RR/MR)   South (Hangul)          wide   neo p tta (n p ta)      neo l tta (n l ta)             to read  (continuative form)   i l kko (i l ko)      i l kko (i l ko)             Amnok River   am r okgang (am r okkang)      am n okkang (am n okkang)             independence   dong r ip (tong r ip)      dong n ip (tong n ip)             idea / sense / conception   gwa ll yeom (kwa ll ym)      gwa nn yeom (kwa nn ym)          *   innovative   hyeoksin jj eok (hyksin tch k)      hyeoksin j eok (hyksin j k)          * Similar pronunciation is used in the North whenever the hanja """" is attached to a Sino-Korean word ending in ,  or . (In the South, this rule only applies when it is attached to any single-character Sino-Korean word.)     [ edit ]   Spelling   Some words are spelled differently by the North and the South, but the pronunciations are the same.       Word spelling   Meaning   Pronunciation (RR/MR)   Remarks       North   South             sunshine   haeppit (haepit)   The ""sai siot"" ('' used for indicating sound change) is almost never written out in the North.             cherry blossom   beotkkot (ptkkot)                cannot read   monnikda (monnikta)   Spacing.             Hallasan   hallasan (hallasan)   When a - combination is pronounced as  ll , the original Hangul spelling is kept in the North, while the Hangul is changed in the South.             rules   gyuyul (kyuyul)   In words where the original hanja is spelt """" or """" and follows a vowel, the initial  is not pronounced in the North, making the pronunciation identical with that in the South where the  is dropped in the spelling.         [ edit ]   Spelling and pronunciation   Some words have different spellings and pronunciations in the North and the South, some of which were given in the ""Phonology"" section above:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          ryeongryang (ryngryang)      yeongnyang (yngnyang)   strength   Korean words originally starting in  r  or  n  have their  r  or  n  dropped in the South Korean version if the sound following it is an  i  or  y  sound.          rodong (rodong)      nodong (nodong)   work   Korean words originally starting in  r  have their  r  changed to  n  in the South Korean version if the sound following it is a sound other than  i  or  y .          wonssu (wnssu)      wonsu (wnsu)   mortal enemy   ""Mortal enemy"" and ""head of state"" are homophones in the South. Possibly to avoid referring to  Kim Il-sung  /  Kim Jong-il  as the enemy, the second syllable of ""enemy"" is written and pronounced  in the North.          rajio (rajio)      radio (radio)   radio            u (u)      wi (wi)   on; above            anhae (anhae)      anae (anae)   wife            kkuba (kkuba)      kuba (k'uba)   Cuba   When transcribing foreign words from languages that do not have contrasts between aspirated and unaspirated stops, North Koreans generally use tensed stops for the unaspirated ones while South Koreans use aspirated stops in both cases.          pe (p'e)      pye (p'ye), pe (p'e)   lungs   All hanja pronounced as  pye  ( p'ye ) or  pe  ( p'e ) in the South are pronounced as  pe  ( p'e ) in the North. The spelling is also accordingly different.       In general, when transcribing place names, North Korea tends to use the pronunciation in the original language more than South Korea, which often uses the pronunciation in English. For example:       Original name   North Korea transliteration   English name   South Korea transliteration       Spelling   Pronunciation   Spelling   Pronunciaton       Ulaanbaatar      ullanbattareu (ullanbattar)   Ulan Bator      ullanbatoreu (ullanbat'or)       Kbenhavn      koeppenhabeun (k'oeppenhabn)   Copenhagen      kopenhagen (k'op'enhagen)       al-Qhirah      kkahira (kkahira)   Cairo      kairo (k'airo)         [ edit ]   Grammar   Some grammatical constructions are also different:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          doeyeotda (toeytta)      doeeotda (toetta)   past tense of  (doeda/toeda), ""to become""   All similar grammar forms of verbs or adjectives that end in  in the stem (i.e. , , , ,  and ) in the North use  instead of the South's .          gomawayo (komawayo)      gomawoyo (komawyo)   thanks   -irregular verbs in the North use  (wa) for all those with a positive ending vowel; this only happens in the South if the verb stem has only one syllable.          halgayo (halkayo)      halkkayo (halkkayo)   Shall we do?   Although the Hangul differ, the pronunciations are the same (i.e. with the tensed  sound).         [ edit ]   Vocabulary   Some vocabulary is different between the North and the South:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          munhwajutaek (munhwajut'aek)      apateu (ap'at')   Apartment     (appateu/appat') is also used in the North.          joseonmal (chosnmal)      han-gugeo(han'gugeo)   Korean language            gwakbap (kwakpap)      dosirak (tosirak)   lunch box           [ edit ]   Others   In the North,  guillemets     and    are the symbols used for quotes; in the South, quotation marks equivalent to the English ones,  and , are standard, although     and     are sometimes used in popular novels.     [ edit ]   Study by non-native speakers   The  United States '  Defense Language Institute  classifies Korean alongside  Arabic ,  Chinese , and  Japanese  as a Category IV language, meaning that 63 weeks of instruction (as compared to just 25 weeks for  French ,  Spanish ,  Portuguese , and  Italian ) are required to bring an English-speaking student to a limited working level of proficiency in which he or she has ""sufficient capability to meet routine social demands and limited job requirements"" and ""can deal with concrete topics in past, present, and future tense."" [ 10 ]  As a result, the study of the Korean language in the United States is dominated by  Korean American  heritage language students; they are estimated to form over 80% of all students of the language at non-military universities. [ 11 ]   However, Korean is considerably easier for speakers of certain other languages, such as Japanese, Mongolian and Turkic languages; in Japan, it is more widely studied by non-heritage learners. [ 12 ]  The  Korean Language Proficiency Test , an examination aimed at assessing non-native speakers' competence in Korean, was instituted in 1997; 17,000 people applied for the 2005 sitting of the examination.

Korean  (  /  , see  below ) is the official  language  of  North Korea  and  South Korea . It is also one of the two official languages in the  Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture  in  China . There are about 78 million Korean speakers. It was formerly written using  Hanja , borrowed  Chinese characters  pronounced in the Korean way. In the 15th century a national writing system was developed by  Sejong the Great , nowadays called  Hangul .   The genealogical  classification  of the Korean language is debated. Some linguists place it in the  Altaic  language family, while others consider it to be a  language isolate . It is  agglutinative  in its morphology and  SOV  in its  syntax .

In South Korea, the language is most often called  Hangungmal  (  ;   ), or more formally,  Hangugeo  (  ;   ) or  Gugeo  (  ;   ; literally ""national language"").   In North Korea and Yanbian in China, the language is most often called  Chosnmal  (  ; with  hanja :   ), or more formally,  Chosn  (  ;   ).   On the other hand, Korean people in the  former USSR , who refer to themselves as  Koryo-saram  (also  Goryeoin  [  ;   ; literally, "" Goryeo  person(s)""]) call the language  Goryeomal  (  ;   ).   In  mainland China , following the establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992, the term  Choxiny  (   or short form:  Choy  (  )) has normally been used to refer to the language spoken in North Korea and Yanbian, while  Hnguy  (   or short form:  Hny  (  )) is used to refer to the language spoken in South Korea.   Some older English sources also used the name ""Korean"" to refer to the language, country, and people.     [ edit ]   History   Main article:  History of the Korean language   Korean is descended from  Old Korean  and  Middle Korean .     [ edit ]   Classification   The classification of the modern Korean language is uncertain, and due to the lack of any one generally accepted theory, it is sometimes described conservatively as a  language isolate .   On the other hand, since the publication of the article of  Ramstedt  in 1926, many linguists support the hypothesis that Korean can be classified as an  Altaic  language, or as a relative of proto-Altaic. Korean is similar to Altaic languages in that they both lack certain grammatical elements, including  number ,  gender ,  articles , fusional morphology, voice, and  relative pronouns  (Kim Namkil). Korean especially bears some  morphological  resemblance to some languages of the Northern Turkic group, namely  Sakha (Yakut) . Vinokurova, a scholar of the Sakha language, noted that like in Korean, and unlike in other  Turkic languages  or a variety of other languages surveyed, adverbs in Sakha are derived from verbs with the help of derivational morphology; however, she did not suggest this implied any relation between the two languages. [ 2 ]   It is also considered likely that Korean is related in some way to  Japanese , since the two languages have nearly identical grammatical structures, and share a number of possible phonological cognates (though a majority of them are likely due to local pronunciations of the Chinese characters from which they are derived), as noted by such researchers as  Samuel E. Martin  and  Roy Andrew Miller  in the late 1960s.  Sergei Starostin  (1991) found about 25% of potential cognates in the Japanese-Korean 100-word  Swadesh list , which places these two languages closer together than other possible members of the Altaic family. [ 3 ]   Genetic relationships have been postulated both directly and indirectly, the latter either through placing both languages in the Altaic family, or by arguing for a relationship between Japanese and the  Buyeo languages  of  Goguryeo  and  Baekje  (see below); the proposed Baekje relationship is supported by cognates such as Baekje  mir , Japanese  mi-  ""three"". [ 4 ]   The possible relationship between Korean and Japanese can be exemplified by such basic vocabularly items as J.     mizu  (Old J.  midu ) : K.     mul  (Middle K.  mirh ) ""water"",  mot  ""lake""; J.     ku-ru  ""come"" (Old J.  ku , also cf. irregular root changes as in past tense   ki-ta , negative   ko-nai  in Modern J.) : K.     ka-da  (""go""); J.     kata-i  ""hard"" (whence     kata-na  ""knife, sword"") : K.  kud-yn  (hard); J.     i-ru  ""to be"" (past tense   i-ta ) : K.     i-da  ""to be""; J.  na ,  -en  : K.  anh  ""not"", J.  minna  (Old J.  mynna ) ""all, everyone"" : K.  manh-  ""many"" (predicate  mana-da ), etc.  [ 5 ] . The same possible cognates are often observed in other members of the potential  Altaic family , esp. in the  Tungusic languages . Cf. Nanay  mue  ""water"",  giagda-  ""to walk"",  anaa, anna  ""not"".   Others argue, however, that the similarities are not due to any genetic relationship, but rather to a  sprachbund  effect. [ citation needed ]  See  East Asian languages  for morphological features shared among languages of the East Asian  sprachbund , and  Classification of Japanese  for further details on the possible relationship. Though it is very difficult to believe words such as ""water"", ""to be"", and ""to go"" arise from sprachbund effects.   It is presumed that modern Korean may be more closely related to the languages of  Samhan  and  Silla  than the Buyeo languages; many Korean scholars believe they were mutually intelligible, and the collective basis of what in the  Goryeo  period would merge to become Middle Korean (the language before the changes that the  Seven-Year War  brought) and eventually Modern Korean. The  Jeju dialect  preserves some archaic features that can also be found in Middle Korean, whose  arae a  is retained in the dialect as a distinct vowel.   There are also more marginal hypotheses proposing various other relationships; for example, a few scholars, such as  Homer B. Hulbert  (1905), have tried to relate Korean to the  Dravidian languages  through the similar syntax in both. [ 6 ]   Though not related to Chinese, it has borrowed heavily; see the Vocabulary section below.     [ edit ]   Dialects   Main article:  Korean dialects          Dialects of Korean       Korean has several  dialects  (called  mal  [literally ""speech""],  saturi , or  bang-eon  in Korean). The  standard language  ( pyojuneo  or  pyojunmal ) of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  P'yngyang . All dialects of Korean are similar to each other, and are in fact all mutually intelligible, perhaps with the exception of the dialect of  Jeju Island  (see  Jeju dialect ). The dialect spoken in Jeju is in fact classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of  Seoul dialect  use very little stress, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of the  Gyeongsang dialect  have a very pronounced intonation.   It is also worth noting that there is substantial evidence for a history of extensive  dialect levelling , or even  convergent evolution  or intermixture of two or more originally distinct linguistic stocks, within the Korean language and its dialects. Many Korean dialects have basic vocabulary that is etymologically distinct from vocabulary of identical meaning in Standard Korean or other dialects, such as South Jeolla dialect /kur/ vs. Standard Korean     /ip/  ""mouth"" or Gyeongsang dialect  /.u.i/  vs. Standard Korean  /puu/  "" garlic chives ."" This suggests that the Korean Peninsula may have at one time been much more linguistically diverse than it is at present. See also the  Buyeo languages   hypothesis .   There is a very close connection between the dialects of Korean and the  regions of Korea , since the boundaries of both are largely determined by mountains and seas. Here is a list of traditional dialect names and locations:       Standard dialect   Where used       Seoul   Seoul  (),  Incheon  (/), most of  Gyeonggi  (/)       P'yngan  (/)   P'yngyang ,  P'yngan  region,  Chagang  (North Korea)       Regional dialect   Where used       Gyeonggi   limited areas of the  Gyeonggi  region (South Korea)       Chungcheong   Daejeon ,  Chungcheong  region (South Korea)       Gangwon   Gangwon-do (South Korea) / Kangwn (North Korea)       Gyeongsang   Busan ,  Daegu ,  Ulsan ,  Gyeongsang  region (South Korea)       Hamgyng   Rasn ,  Hamgyng  region,  Ryanggang  (North Korea)       Hwanghae   Hwanghae  region (North Korea)       Jeju   Jeju Island/Province  (South Korea)       Jeolla   Gwangju ,  Jeolla  region (South Korea)         [ edit ]   Phonology       This article contains  IPA  phonetic symbols.  Without proper  rendering support , you may see  question marks, boxes, or other symbols  instead of  Unicode  characters.       Main article:  Korean phonology     [ edit ]   Consonants          The Korean consonants             Bilabial   Alveolar   Post-  alveolar   Velar   Glottal       Nasal      /m/      /n/        //  (syllable-final)         Plosive  and   Affricate   plain      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         tense      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         aspirated      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         Fricative   plain        /s/          /h/       tense        /s/             Liquid        /l/           The  IPA  symbol <  > (a subscript double straight quotation mark, shown here with a placeholder circle) is used to denote the tensed consonants  /p/, /t/, /k/, //, /s/ . Its official use in the  Extensions to the IPA  is for  'strong'  articulation, but is used in the literature for  faucalized voice . The Korean consonants also have elements of  stiff voice , but it is not yet known how typical this is of faucalized consonants. They are produced with a partially constricted  glottis  and additional subglottal pressure in addition to tense vocal tract walls, laryngeal lowering, or other expansion of the larynx.     [ edit ]   Vowels                    The Korean basic vowels                 Monophthongs   /i/    ,  /e/    ,  //    ,  /a/    ,  /o/    ,  /u/    ,  //    ,  //    ,  //          Vowels preceded by intermediaries,  or Diphthongs   /je/    ,  /j/    ,  /ja/    ,  /wi/    ,  /we/    ,  /w/    ,  /wa/    ,  /i/    ,  /jo/    ,  /ju/    ,  /j/    ,  /w/            [ edit ]   Allophones   /s/  becomes an  alveolo-palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i]  for most speakers (but see  Differences in the language between North Korea and South Korea ). This occurs with the tense fricative and all the affricates as well. At the end of a syllable, /s/ changes to /t/ (Example: beoseot () 'mushroom').   /h/  may become a  bilabial   []  before  [o]  or  [u] , a  palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i] , a  velar   [x]  before  [] , a voiced  []  between voiced sounds, and a  [h]  elsewhere. [ citation needed ]   /p, t, , k/  become voiced  [b, d, , ]  between voiced sounds.   /l/  becomes alveolar flap  []  between vowels, and  [l]  or  []  at the end of a syllable or next to another  /l/ . Note that a written syllable-final '', when followed by a vowel or a glide ( i.e. , when the next character starts with ''), migrates to the next syllable and thus becomes  [] .   Traditionally,  /l/  was disallowed at the beginning of a word. It disappeared before  [j] , and otherwise became  /n/ . However, the inflow of western loanword changed the trend, and now word-initial  /l/  (mostly from English loanwords) are pronounced as a free variation of either  []  or  [l] . The traditional prohibition of word-initial  /l/  became a morphological rule called ""initial law"" () in South Korea, which pertains to Sino-Korean vocabulary. Such words retain their word-initial  /l/  in North Korea.   All  obstruents  (plosives, affricates, fricatives) are  unreleased   [p, t, k]  at the end of a word.   Plosive stops  /p, t, k/  become nasal stops  [m, n, ]  before nasal stops.   Hangul  spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying, partly historical  morphology . Given this, it is sometimes hard to tell which actual phonemes are present in a certain word.   One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial  [r] , and initial  [n] . For example,     ""labour"" - north:  r odong  (), south:  n odong  ()   ""history"" - north:  ry ksa  (), south:  y eoksa  ()   ""female"" - north:  ny ja  (), south:  y eoja  ()       [ edit ]   Morphophonemics   Grammatical morphemes may change shape depending on the preceding sounds. Examples include  -eun/-neun  (-/-) and  -i/-ga  (-/-). Sometimes sounds may be inserted instead. Examples include  -eul/-reul  (-/-),  -euro/-ro  (-/-),  -eseo/-seo  (-/-),  -ideunji/-deunji  (-/-) and  -iya/-ya  (-/-). However,  -euro/-ro  is somewhat irregular, since it will behave differently after a rieul consonant.     Korean particles     After a consonant   After a rieul   After a vowel       -ui  (-)       -eun  (-)   -neun  (-)       -i  (-)   -ga  (-)       -eul  (-)   -reul  (-)       -gwa  (-)   -wa  (-)       -euro  (-)   -ro  (-)       Some verbs may also change shape morphophonemically.     [ edit ]   Grammar   Main article:  Korean grammar     [ edit ]   Sentence structure   Korean is an  agglutinative language . Modifiers generally follow the modified word, and in the case of verb modifiers, can be serially appended. The basic form of a Korean sentence is  Subject Object Verb , but the verb is the only required and immovable element.       A :       -       -? (?)           kage-e     kasseo-yo           store + [location marker ()]     [go (verb root) ()]+[conjunctive ()]+[past ()]+[conjunctive ()]+ [polite marker ()]         ""Did [you] go to the store?"" (with ""you"" implied by context)         B :       .           ye           yes         ""Yes.""       [ edit ]   Parts of speech     [ edit ]   Verb   Korean  verbs  (  ,  tongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""action verbs"" or ""dynamic verbs"" to distinguish them from [  () ,  hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""]), which are also known as ""descriptive verbs"" or ""stative verbs"". Examples of action/dynamic verbs include    ( hada , ""to do"") and    ( kada , ""to go"") which constitute an action or movement as opposed to descriptive verbs such as    ( yehppeuda , ""to be beautiful""). For a larger list of Korean verbs, see  wikt:Category:Korean verbs .   Unlike most of the European languages, Korean does not conjugate verbs using agreement with the subject, and nouns have no gender. Instead, verb conjugations depend upon the verb tense, aspect, mood, and the social relation between the speaker, the subjects, and the listeners. The system of speech levels and honorifics loosely resembles the  T-V distinction  of most  Indo-European languages . For example, different endings are used based on the speaker's relation with the person they are talking to or the person about which they are talking. Politeness is a critical part of Korean language and Korean culture, therefore, when talking to someone esteemed, the correct verb ending, which should have a lot of respect, must be chosen.     [ edit ]   Adjective   Words categorized as Korean  adjectives  (  ,  hyeong-yongsa ,   ) conjugate similarly to verbs, so some English texts call them ""descriptive verbs"" or "" stative verbs "", but they are distinctly separate from    ( tongsa ).   English does not have an identical grammatical category, so the English translation of Korean adjectives may misleadingly suggest that they are verbs. For example,    ( pukda ) translates literally as ""to be red"" and    ( aswipda ) often best translates as ""to lack"" or ""to want for"", but both are    ( hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""). For a larger list of Korean adjectives, see  wikt:Category:Korean adjectives .     [ edit ]   Determiner   Korean  determiners  (  ,  gwanhyeongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""determinatives"", ""adnominals"", ""pre-nouns"", ""attributives"", and ""unconjugated adjectives"". Examples include    ( kak , ""each""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean determiners .     [ edit ]   Noun   A large body of Korean  nouns  (  ,  myeongsa ,   ) stem from  Chinese characters , e.g.    (,  san , mountain),    (,  yeok , station),    (,  munhwa , culture), etc. Others are native to the Korean language, e.g.    ( nara , country),    ( nal , day). Many  Sino-Korean words  have a native Korean equivalent and vice versa, but not always. Nouns do not have  grammatical gender  and can be made  plural  by adding  to the end of the word, however in most instances the  singular  form is used even when in English it would be translated as plural. For example, while in English the sentence  ""there are three apples""  would use the plural  ""apples""  instead of the singular  ""apple"" , the Korean sentence    ( sagwa segae isssumnida ) maintains the word  ( sagwa , ""apple"") in its singular form, thus rendered in English as ""apple three(things) exist."" For a list of Korean nouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean nouns .     [ edit ]   Pronoun   Main article:  Korean pronouns   Korean  pronouns  (  ,  daemyeongsa ,   ) are highly influenced by the honorifics in the language. Pronouns change forms depending on the social status of the person or persons spoken to, e.g. the pronoun for ""I"" there is both the informal    ( na ) and the honorific/humble    ( jeo ). In general second person singular pronouns are avoided, especially when using honorific forms. For a larger list or Korean pronouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean pronouns .     [ edit ]   Adverb   Korean  adverbs  (  ,  busa ,   ) include    ( tto , ""also"") and    ( gadeuk , ""fully""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean adverbs .     [ edit ]   Particle   Korean  particles  (  ,  josa ,   ) are also known in English as "" postpositions "". Examples include    ( neun , topic marker) and    ( reul , object marker). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean particles .     [ edit ]   Interjection   Korean  interjections  (  ,  gamtansa ,   ) are also known in English as ""exclamations"". Examples include    ( ani , ""no""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean interjections .     [ edit ]   Number   Main article:  Korean numerals   Korean  numbers  or numerals (  ,  sutja ,   ) consitute two regularly used sets: a native Korean set and a  Sino-Korean  set. The Sino-Korean system is nearly entirely based on the  Chinese numerals . The distinction between the two numeral systems is very important. Everything that can be counted will use one of the two systems, but seldom both. Sino-Korean words are sometimes used to mark ordinal usage: yeol beon ( ) means ""ten times"" while sip beon (() ()) means ""number ten."" The grouping of large numbers in Korean follow the Chinese tradition of myriads (10000) rather than thousands (1000) as is common in Europe and North America.     [ edit ]   Speech levels and honorifics   Main article:  Korean honorifics   The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean, and the grammar reflects this. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject referent is reflected in  honorifics , while that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in  speech level .     [ edit ]   Honorifics   When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a younger stranger, student, employee or the like. Nowadays, there are special endings which can be used on declarative, interrogative, and imperative sentences; and both honorific or normal sentences. They are made for easier and faster use of Korean.     [ edit ]   Speech levels   There are seven verb  paradigms  or  speech levels  in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation. [ citation needed ]  Unlike  honorifics   which are used to show respect towards the referent   speech levels  are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience. The names of the 7 levels are derived from the non-honorific  imperative  form of the verb    ( hada , ""do"") in each level, plus the suffix  ('che',  hanja :   ), which means ""style.""   The highest 6 levels are generally grouped together as  jondaenmal  (), while the lowest level ( haeche , ) is called  banmal  () in Korean.     [ edit ]   Vocabulary   The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words. Like Japanese and Vietnamese, more than 50% of the vocabulary (up to 60% by some estimates), especially words that denote abstract ideas, are  Sino-Korean words , [ 7 ]  either     directly borrowed from  Written Chinese , or   coined in Japan or Korea using  Chinese characters ,     in a similar way European languages borrow from Latin and Greek. Korean has two  number systems : one native, and one borrowed from Chinese.   To a much lesser extent, words have also occasionally been borrowed from  Mongolian ,  Sanskrit , and other languages. Conversely, the Korean language itself has also contributed some loanwords to other languages, most notably the  Tsushima dialect  of Japanese.   The vast majority of loanwords other than Sino-Korean come from modern times, 90% of which are from  English . [ 8 ]  Many words have also been borrowed from  Japanese  and  Western languages  such as  German  ( areubaiteu  part-time job,  allereugi  allergy). Some Western words were borrowed indirectly via Japanese, taking a Japanese sound pattern, for example dozen >     dsu  >     daseu . Most indirect Western borrowings are now written according to current Hangulization rules for the respective Western language, as if borrowed directly. There are a few more complicated borrowings such as German(y) (see  Names for Germany ), the first part of whose  endonym   [d.lant]  the Japanese approximated using the  kanji      doitsu  that were then accepted into the Korean language by their Sino-Korean pronunciation:     dok  +     il  =  Dogil . In South Korean official use, a number of other Sino-Korean country names have been replaced with phonetically oriented Hangulizations of the countries' endonyms or English names.   North Korean vocabulary shows a tendency to prefer native Korean over Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings, especially with recent political objectives aimed at eliminating foreign (mostly Chinese) influences on the Korean language in the North. By contrast, South Korean may have several Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings which tend to be absent in North Korean.     [ edit ]   Writing system       Korean writing systems           Hangul       Hanja       Hyangchal   Gugyeol   Idu       Mixed script       Korean romanization       Revised Romanization of Korean   McCune-Reischauer   Yale Romanization           Main article:  Hangul   See also:  Hangul consonant and vowel tables   In ancient times, the languages of the Korean peninsula were written using  Chinese characters , using  hyangchal  or  idu . Such systems were not popular because hanja is not well suited to the Korean language. Its use is now limited.   Korean is now mainly written in Hangul, the Korean alphabet promulgated in 1446 by  Sejong the Great ;  hanja may be mixed in  to write  Sino-Korean words . South Korea still teaches 1800 hanja characters in its schools, while the North abolished the use of hanja decades ago.   Below is a chart of the Korean alphabet's symbols and their canonical  IPA  values:     Consonants     Hangul                                                                        RR   b , p   d , t   j   g , k   pp   tt   jj   kk   p   t   ch   k   s   h   ss   m   n   ng       r , l           IPA   p   t      k   p   t      k   p   t      k   s   h   s   m   n      w   r   j         Vowels     Hangul                                                                      RR   i   e   oe   ae   a   o   u   eo   eu   ui   ye   yae   ya   yo   yu   yeo   wi   we   wae   wa   wo       IPA   i   e         a   o   u         i   je   j   ja   jo   ju   j   wi   we   w   wa   w       Modern Korean is written with  spaces  between  words , a feature not found in Chinese or Japanese. Korean  punctuation  marks are almost identical to Western ones. Traditionally, Korean was written in columns from top to bottom, right to left, but is now usually written in rows from left to right, top to bottom.     [ edit ]   Differences between North Korean and South Korean   Main article:  Korean language North-South differences   The Korean language used in the North and the South exhibits differences in pronunciation, spelling, grammar and vocabulary. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Pronunciation   In North Korea,  palatalization  of  /si/  is optional, and  //  can be pronounced as  [z]  in between vowels.   Words that are written the same way may be pronounced differently, such as the examples below. The pronunciations below are given in  Revised Romanization ,  McCune-Reischauer  and Hangul, the last of which represents what the Hangul would be if one writes the word as pronounced.       Word   Meaning   Pronunciation       North (RR/MR)   North (Hangul)   South (RR/MR)   South (Hangul)          wide   neo p tta (n p ta)      neo l tta (n l ta)             to read  (continuative form)   i l kko (i l ko)      i l kko (i l ko)             Amnok River   am r okgang (am r okkang)      am n okkang (am n okkang)             independence   dong r ip (tong r ip)      dong n ip (tong n ip)             idea / sense / conception   gwa ll yeom (kwa ll ym)      gwa nn yeom (kwa nn ym)          *   innovative   hyeoksin jj eok (hyksin tch k)      hyeoksin j eok (hyksin j k)          * Similar pronunciation is used in the North whenever the hanja """" is attached to a Sino-Korean word ending in ,  or . (In the South, this rule only applies when it is attached to any single-character Sino-Korean word.)     [ edit ]   Spelling   Some words are spelled differently by the North and the South, but the pronunciations are the same.       Word spelling   Meaning   Pronunciation (RR/MR)   Remarks       North   South             sunshine   haeppit (haepit)   The ""sai siot"" ('' used for indicating sound change) is almost never written out in the North.             cherry blossom   beotkkot (ptkkot)                cannot read   monnikda (monnikta)   Spacing.             Hallasan   hallasan (hallasan)   When a - combination is pronounced as  ll , the original Hangul spelling is kept in the North, while the Hangul is changed in the South.             rules   gyuyul (kyuyul)   In words where the original hanja is spelt """" or """" and follows a vowel, the initial  is not pronounced in the North, making the pronunciation identical with that in the South where the  is dropped in the spelling.         [ edit ]   Spelling and pronunciation   Some words have different spellings and pronunciations in the North and the South, some of which were given in the ""Phonology"" section above:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          ryeongryang (ryngryang)      yeongnyang (yngnyang)   strength   Korean words originally starting in  r  or  n  have their  r  or  n  dropped in the South Korean version if the sound following it is an  i  or  y  sound.          rodong (rodong)      nodong (nodong)   work   Korean words originally starting in  r  have their  r  changed to  n  in the South Korean version if the sound following it is a sound other than  i  or  y .          wonssu (wnssu)      wonsu (wnsu)   mortal enemy   ""Mortal enemy"" and ""head of state"" are homophones in the South. Possibly to avoid referring to  Kim Il-sung  /  Kim Jong-il  as the enemy, the second syllable of ""enemy"" is written and pronounced  in the North.          rajio (rajio)      radio (radio)   radio            u (u)      wi (wi)   on; above            anhae (anhae)      anae (anae)   wife            kkuba (kkuba)      kuba (k'uba)   Cuba   When transcribing foreign words from languages that do not have contrasts between aspirated and unaspirated stops, North Koreans generally use tensed stops for the unaspirated ones while South Koreans use aspirated stops in both cases.          pe (p'e)      pye (p'ye), pe (p'e)   lungs   All hanja pronounced as  pye  ( p'ye ) or  pe  ( p'e ) in the South are pronounced as  pe  ( p'e ) in the North. The spelling is also accordingly different.       In general, when transcribing place names, North Korea tends to use the pronunciation in the original language more than South Korea, which often uses the pronunciation in English. For example:       Original name   North Korea transliteration   English name   South Korea transliteration       Spelling   Pronunciation   Spelling   Pronunciaton       Ulaanbaatar      ullanbattareu (ullanbattar)   Ulan Bator      ullanbatoreu (ullanbat'or)       Kbenhavn      koeppenhabeun (k'oeppenhabn)   Copenhagen      kopenhagen (k'op'enhagen)       al-Qhirah      kkahira (kkahira)   Cairo      kairo (k'airo)         [ edit ]   Grammar   Some grammatical constructions are also different:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          doeyeotda (toeytta)      doeeotda (toetta)   past tense of  (doeda/toeda), ""to become""   All similar grammar forms of verbs or adjectives that end in  in the stem (i.e. , , , ,  and ) in the North use  instead of the South's .          gomawayo (komawayo)      gomawoyo (komawyo)   thanks   -irregular verbs in the North use  (wa) for all those with a positive ending vowel; this only happens in the South if the verb stem has only one syllable.          halgayo (halkayo)      halkkayo (halkkayo)   Shall we do?   Although the Hangul differ, the pronunciations are the same (i.e. with the tensed  sound).         [ edit ]   Vocabulary   Some vocabulary is different between the North and the South:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          munhwajutaek (munhwajut'aek)      apateu (ap'at')   Apartment     (appateu/appat') is also used in the North.          joseonmal (chosnmal)      han-gugeo(han'gugeo)   Korean language            gwakbap (kwakpap)      dosirak (tosirak)   lunch box           [ edit ]   Others   In the North,  guillemets     and    are the symbols used for quotes; in the South, quotation marks equivalent to the English ones,  and , are standard, although     and     are sometimes used in popular novels.     [ edit ]   Study by non-native speakers   The  United States '  Defense Language Institute  classifies Korean alongside  Arabic ,  Chinese , and  Japanese  as a Category IV language, meaning that 63 weeks of instruction (as compared to just 25 weeks for  French ,  Spanish ,  Portuguese , and  Italian ) are required to bring an English-speaking student to a limited working level of proficiency in which he or she has ""sufficient capability to meet routine social demands and limited job requirements"" and ""can deal with concrete topics in past, present, and future tense."" [ 10 ]  As a result, the study of the Korean language in the United States is dominated by  Korean American  heritage language students; they are estimated to form over 80% of all students of the language at non-military universities. [ 11 ]   However, Korean is considerably easier for speakers of certain other languages, such as Japanese, Mongolian and Turkic languages; in Japan, it is more widely studied by non-heritage learners. [ 12 ]  The  Korean Language Proficiency Test , an examination aimed at assessing non-native speakers' competence in Korean, was instituted in 1997; 17,000 people applied for the 2005 sitting of the examination.

The language is also spoken widely in neighbouring  Yanbian ,  China .  Worldwide, there are around 78 million Korean speakers, including large groups in the former  Soviet Union , the  United States ,  Canada ,  Brazil  and  Japan . Proper  classification  of Korean is not universally agreed on, but it is often considered by many to be a  language isolate . Some linguists instead group it in the hypothetical  Altaic  language family.  The native Korean writing system—called  Hangul —is  syllabic  and phonetic.   Sino-Korean  characters ( Hanja ) are also used in writing.  While the most commonly used words in the language are of native Korean origin, well over 50% of the language's vocabulary consists of words composed from  Hanja .  Korean is  agglutinative  in its word formation and  SOV  in its syntax.

The Korean names for the language are based on the  names for Korea  used in North and South  Korea.    In North Korea, Korea is called ""Chosŏn"" (조선), and the language is most often called ""Chosŏnmal"" (조선말) or more formally, ""Chosŏnŏ"" (조선어).  In South Korea, Korea is called ""Hanguk"" (In  Hangul : 한국).  There and outside of Korea, the language is most often called ""Hangungmal"" (한국말), or more formally, ""Hangugeo"" (한국어).  The language is also sometimes referred to colloquially as ""Urimal"" (우리말; ""our language"").  The standard language taught in schools is often referred to as ""Gugeo"" (국어; ""national language"").  Korea was also called ""Chosŏn"" (""Chosen"" in  Japanese ) during the  Japanese Colonial Period  ( 1910 - 1945 ), and so many important linguistic works written during that period also refer to the language by the names ""Chosŏnŏ"" or ""Chosŏnmal.""      Classification and related languages   Korean is often classified as being a separate language in a family of its own (a  language isolate ). In addition, most Korean and some Western linguists recognize Korean's kinship to the  Altaic languages . On the other hand, traditional Western (since the 18th century) and many Japanese linguists believe that Korean has a linguistic relationship with  Japanese .  In Korea, the possibility of Korean-Japanese linguistic relationship has been ignored mostly; partly because the often strained relations between the two countries throughout history tend to make any discussion of a relationship between their languages a controversial one, and partly due to the lack of cognates. However, the Korean relationship with  Altaic  and proto-Altaic also have been much argued as of late. It does bear some  morphological  resemblance to some languages of the Eastern Turkic group, namely,  Yakut  and some of its variants, and a few linguists believe that Altaic itself forms part of a larger  Ural-Altaic  language family. The opponents of this view believe that much of the  Altaic  influences in the language was infused later in Korean history during the Mongol rule over Korea during the  Goryeo  dynasty. Proponents of this theory cite old Korean cognates to Mongolian to support their claim.  Korean is similar to Altaic language in that they both have: the absence of grammatical elements such as number, genders, articles, fusional morphology, voice, relative pronouns, conjunctions, vowel harmony, and agglutination (Kim Namkil).   In the late 19th century, Homer B. Hulbert, an English linguist, theorised that Korean is related to the Dravidian languages of India. His argument was based on syntatic similarities between Dravidian languages and Korean. Dravidian and Korean are similar syntatically in that they both have: the word order subject-object-verb, postpositions instead of prepositions, no relative pronouns, modifiers in front of the head noun, copula and existential as two distinct grammatical parts of speech etc (Kim Namkil).    Geographic distribution   Most of the speakers of the Korean language live in  North  and  South Korea . However, there are some ethnic Koreans in  China , the former  Soviet Union , and the  United States .    Dialects   Korean has several  dialects  (called  mal  (literally speech),  bang-eon , or  saturi  in Korean). The  standard language  ( Pyojuneo  or  Pyojunmal ) of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  P'yŏngyang . These dialects are similar, and in fact all dialects except that of  Jeju  Island are largely mutually intelligible. The dialect spoken there is classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of  Seoul Dialect  use stress very little, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of Gyeongsang Dialect  have a very pronounced intonation that makes their dialect sound more like a European language to western ears.  There is a very close connection between the dialects of Korean and the  regions of Korea , since the boundaries of both are largely determined by mountains and seas.  Here is a list of traditional dialect names and locations:          Standard Dialect     Where Used         Seoul     Seoul ,  Incheon ,  Gyeonggi  ( South Korea );  Kaesŏng  ( North Korea )       P'yŏngan     P'yŏngyang ,  P'yŏngan  region,  Chagang  (North Korea)        Regional Dialect     Where Used        Chungcheong     Daejeon ,  Chungcheong  region (South Korea)       Gangwon     Gangwon  (South Korea)/ Kangwŏn  (North Korea)       Gyeongsang     Busan ,  Daegu ,  Ulsan ,  Gyeongsang  region (South Korea)       Hamgyŏng     Rasŏn , Hamgyŏng  region,  Ryanggang  (North Korea)       Hwanghae     Hwanghae  region (North Korea)       Jeju     Jeju  Island/Province (South Korea)       Jeolla     Gwangju ,  Jeolla  region (South Korea)    Sounds   Consonants         Bilabial  Alveolar  Palatal  Velar  Glottal      Stop  plain   p   t   c   k         tensed   pʼ   tʼ   cʼ   kʼ         aspirated   p h    t h    c h    k h         Fricative   plain     s       h       tensed     sʼ            Nasal   m   n     ŋ        Lateral approximant     l           Example words for consonants:           phoneme     IPA     Romanized     English           p     pal     bal     'foot'           pʼ     pʼal     ppal     'sucking'            p h     p h al     pal     'arm'           m     mal     mal     'horse'           t     tal     dal     'moon'           tʼ     tʼal     ttal     'daughter'            t h     t h al     tal     'riding'           n     nal     nal     'day'           c     cal     jal     'well'           cʼ     cʼal     jjal     'squeezing'            c h     c h al     chal     'kicking'           k     kal     gal     'going'           kʼ     kʼal     kkal     'spreading'            k h     k h al     kal     'knife'           ŋ     paŋ     bang     'room'           s     sal     sal     'flesh'           sʼ     sʼal     ssal     'rice'            l     palam     baram     'wind'           h     hal     hal     'doing'        ,   [cʰ] , and   [cʼ]  have more frication than the other stops and are sometimes described as affricates.   The symbol   ʼ  is used to denote the tensed consonants (  [pʼ] ,   [tʼ] ,   [cʼ] ,   [kʼ] , and   [sʼ] ) but its official  IPA  usage is for  ejective  consonants, which the tensed stops in Korean are not. The tensed stops are produced with a partially constricted  glottis  and additional subglottal pressure. However, it may be argued that such a manner of articulation can still be categorized as  glottalization , justifying the use of   ʼ .    Vowels       Monophthongs   Korean has 8 different vowel qualities and a length distinction. Two more vowels, the close-mid front rounded vowel   [ø]  and the close front rounded vowel   [y] , can still be heard in the speech of some older speakers, but they have been largely replaced by the diphthongs   [we]  and   [wi]  respectively. In a 2003 survey of 350 speakers from Seoul, nearly 90% pronounced the vowel 'ㅟ' as   [wi] . Length distinction is also decreasing; length distinction for all vowels can still be heard from older speakers, but many younger speakers do not always distinguish lengths consistently.             i       siˈɟaŋ     sijang     'hunger'       iː       ˈsiːɟaŋ     sijang     'market'             e       peˈɡɛ     begae     'pillow'       eː       ˈpeːda     beda     'cut'             ɛ       tʰɛˈjaŋ     taeyang     'sun'       ɛː       ˈtʰɛːdo     taedo     'attitude'             a       ˈmal     mal     'horse'       aː       ˈmaːl     mal     'speech'             o       poˈli     bori     'barley'       oː       ˈpoːsu     bosu     'salary'             u       kuˈli     guri     'copper'       uː       ˈsuːbak     subak     'watermelon'             ʌ       ˈpʌl     beol     'punishment'       ʌː       ˈpʌːl     beol     'bee'             ɯ       ˈʌːlɯn     eoreun     'seniors'       ɯː       ˈɯːmsik     eumsik     'food'         Diphthongs and glides   [j]  and   [w]  are considered to be components of diphthongs rather than separate consonant phonemes.                           wi   dwi   dwi 'back'           ɯi   ˈɯisa uisa 'doctor'        je   ˈjeːsan yesan 'budget'           we   kwe gwe 'box'                        jɛ   ˈjɛːki yaegi 'story'           wɛ   wɛ wae 'why'                        ja   ˈjaːgu yagu 'baseball'           wa   kwaːˈil kwa-il 'fruits'                        jo   ˈkjoːs’a gyosa 'teacher'                                        ju   juˈli yuri 'glass'                                        jʌ   jʌːgi yeogi 'here'           wʌ   mwʌ mweo 'what'                     Source:  Handbook of the International Phonetic Association     Phonology   [s]  becomes palatalized as   [ʃ]  or   [ɕ]  before   [j]  or   [i] .    [h]  becomes labialized   [ɸ]  before   [o]  and   [u]  and palatalized   [ç]  before   [j]  or   [i] .    [p] ,   [t] ,   [c] , and   [k]  become voiced   [b] ,   [d] ,   [ɟ] , and   [ɡ]  between  sonorant  segments.    [l]  becomes alveolar flap   [ɾ]  between  sonorant  segments, such as between two  vowels .  Phonetic rules, mostly  assimilation , transform the pronunciation of some words. For example,       Jong l o  is pronounced as  Jong n o     Han k u k mal  as  Han- g u ng mal     Stop consonants are generally voiceless, but lightly aspirated stops become voiced and unaspirated in intervocalic position. For example,     p -> b   t -> d   k -> g    Stops are nasalized before a nasal. For example,     p -> m (before m, n, or ng)   t -> n (before m, n, or ng)   k -> ng (before m, n, or ng)    Hangul  spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying  morphology .  One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial   [r]  (also the initial   [n]  before   [i]  or   [y] ). For example,     勞動 north:  r odong , south:  n odong  (labour)   歷史 north:  ry ŏksa , south:  y eoksa  (history)   女子 north:  ny ŏja , south:  y eoja  (lady)    Vowel harmony   Traditionally, the Korean language has had strong  vowel harmony ; that is, in pre-modern Korean, as in most Altaic languages, not only did the inflectional and derivational affixes (such as  postpositions ) change in accordance to the main root vowel, but native words also adhered to vowel harmony.  It is not as prevalent in modern usage, although it remains strong in  onomatopoeia ,  adjectives  and  adverbs ,  interjections , and  conjugation . There are also other traces of vowel harmony in Korean.           Korean Vowel Harmony       Positive/Yang Vowels   ㅏ (a)   ㅑ (ya)   ㅗ (o)   ㅛ (yo)         ㅐ (ae)   ㅘ (wa)   ㅚ (oe)   ㅙ (wae)       Negative/Yin Vowels   ㅓ (eo)   ㅕ (yeo)   ㅜ (u)   ㅠ (yu)         ㅔ (e)   ㅝ (weo)   ㅟ (wi)   ㅞ (we)       Neutral/Centre Vowels   ㅡ (eu)   ㅣ (i)   ㅢ (eui)      There are three classes of vowels in Korean: positive, negative, and neutral. The vowel ŭ is considered partially a neutral and negative vowel. The vowel classes loosely follow the mid (negative) and front (positive) vowels; they also follow orthography. Exchanging positive vowels with negative vowels usually creates different nuances of meaning.    Examples   Onomatopoeia:   퐁당퐁당 (pong-dang-pong-dang)  풍덩풍덩 (pung-deong-pung-deong) (Water splashing)    Adjectives/Adverbs:   무럭무럭 (mureokmureok) and 모락모락 (morakmorak) can both be translated as ""rapidly"" or ""densely"", but each has different connotations:  연기가 모락모락 나다 ( yeonggiga morakmorak nada ) Smoke rises up.  나무가 무럭무럭 자란다 ( Namuga mureokmureok jaranda ) The tree grows well.       Emphasised Adjectives:   노랗다 (noratta) means plain yellow, while its negative, 누렇다 (nureotta) means very yellow  파랗다 (paratta) means plain blue, while its negative, 퍼렇다 (peoreota) means deep blue    Particles at the end of verbs:   잡다 (Japda) (to catch) → 잡았다 (Jabatda) (caught)  접다 (Jeopda) (to fold) → 접었다 (Jeobeotda) (folded)    Interjections:   아이고 (Aigo) and 어이구 (Eoigu) meaning ""oh my!""  어허 (Eoheo) and 아하 (Aha) meaning ""indeed"" and ""well"" respectively      Grammar   Korean is an  agglutinative language . The basic form of a Korean sentence is Subject-Object-Verb ( SOV ), and modifiers precede the modified word. As a side note, a sentence can break the SOV word order, however, it must end with the verb.  In contrast to the Korean word order, in English, one would say, ""I'm going to the store to buy some food,” in Korean it would be: *""I food to-buy in-order-to store-to going-am.""  In Korean, ""unnecessary"" words (see  theme and rheme ) can be left out of a sentence as long as the context makes the meaning clear. A typical exchange might translate word-for word to the following:    H: ""가게에 가세요?"" ( gage-e gaseyo? )  G: ""예."" ( ye. )      H: *""store-to going?""  G: ""yes.""      which in English would translate to:    H: ""Are you going to the store?""  G: ""Yes.""      Though it is worth noting that in colloquial English one might say 'Going to the store?', it is not considered standard, as it is in Korean.  Unlike most European languages, Korean does not conjugate verbs using agreement with the subject, and nouns have no gender. Instead, verb conjugations depend upon the verb tense and on the relation between the people speaking. When talking to or about friends, you would use one conjugate ending, to your parents, another, and to nobility/honoured persons, another. This loosely echoes the  T-V distinction  of most  Indo-European languages .     Speech levels and honorifics    The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean, and the grammar reflects this. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject is reflected in  honorifics , while that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in  speech level .    Honorifics   When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer to use special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older distant relative (grandparent's sibling, older sibling's spouse, etc.), a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a close relative (grandparent, parent, spouse, or sibling), younger stranger, student, employee or the like. On rare occasions (like when someone wants to pick a fight), a speaker might speak to a superior or stranger in a way normally only used for, say, animals, but no one would do this without seriously considering the consequences to their physical safety first!  One way of using honorifics is to use  special nouns  in place of regular nouns with ""honorific"" ones. A common example is using  jinji  instead of  bap  for ""food"". More often, special nouns are used when speaking about relatives. Thus, the speaker/writer may address his own grandmother as  halmeoni  but refer to someone else's grandmother as  halmeonim . The  m  comes from the honorific suffix  -nim  (님), which is affixed to many kinship terms to make them honorific; thus,  hyeongnim  is the formal term for an older sibling of the same sex (derived from  hyeong,  the informal term for man's older brother;  eonni  is the informal term for a woman's older sister).  All verbs can be converted into an honorific form by adding the infix  -si-  (시, pronounced  shi ) after the  stem  and before the verb ending . Thus,  gada  (""go"") becomes  gasida . A few verbs have special honorific equivalents. Therefore  gyesida  is the honorific form of  itda  (""exist"");  japsusida  is the honorific form of  meokda  (""eat""); and  jumusida  is the honorific form of  jada  (""sleep"").  A few verbs have special humble forms, used when the speaker is referring to him/herself in polite situations. These include  deurida  and  ollida  for  juda  (""give"").  Deurida  is substituted for  juda  when the latter is used as an  auxiliary  verb, while  ollida --which literally means ""raise up""--is used for  juda  in the sense of ""offer"".  Pronouns in Korean  have their own set of polite equivalents: thus,  jeo  is the humble form of  na  (""I"");  jeoheui  is the humble form of  uri  (""we""); and  dangsin  (""friend,"" but only used as a form of address and more polite than ""chingu"", the usual word for ""friend""; also, whereas uses of other humble forms are straightforward, ""dangsin"" must be used only in specific social contexts, such as between two married couple--""dangsin"" can often be used in ironic sense when used between strangers) is the honorific form of  neo  (""you"" (singular). Note: in general, Koreans avoid using second person singular pronoun, especially when using honorific forms, and either i) use the person's name or title in place of ""you"" in English, or ii) use plural ""ieoreobun"" where applicable).    Speech levels   There are no fewer than 7 verb  paradigms  or  speech levels  in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation. Unlike  honorifics --which are used to show respect towards a subject-- speech levels  are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience. The names of the 7 levels are derived from the non-honorific  imperative  form of the verb  hada  (""do"") in each level, plus the suffix  che , which means ""style.""  The highest 5 levels use  final  verb endings , while the lowest 2 levels ( haeyoche ) and ( haeche ) use non-final  endings  and are called  banmal  (""half-words"") in Korean. (The  haeyoche  in turn is formed by simply adding the non-final ending  yo  (요) to the  haeche  form of the verb.)  Taken together, honorifics and speech levels form a  cartesian product  of 14 basic verb stems. Here is a table giving the 7 levels, the  present   indicative  form of the verb  hada  (하다; ""do"" in English) in each level in both its honorific and non-honorific forms, and the situations in which each level is used.      Speech Level Non-Honorific Present Indicative of ""hada"" Honorific Present Indicative of ""hada"" Level of Formality When Used   Hasoseoche (하소서체) hanaida (하나이다) hashinaida (하시나이다) Extremely formal and polite Traditionally used when addressing a king, queen, or high official; now used only in historical dramas and the Bible   Hapshoche (합쇼체) hamnida (합니다) hashimnida (하십니다) Formal and polite Used commonly between strangers, among male co-workers, by TV announcers, and to customers   Haoche (하오체) hao (하오) hasho (하쇼), hashio (하시오) Formal, of neutral politeness Only used nowadays among some older people   Hageche (하게체) hane (하네) hashine (하시네) Formal, of neutral politeness Generally only used by some older people when addressing younger people, friends, or relatives   Haerache (해라체) handa (한다) hashinda (하신다) Formal, of neutral politeness or impolite Used to close friends, relatives of similar age, or younger people; also used almost universally in books, newspapers, and magazines; also used in reported speech (""She said that..."")   Haeyoche (해요체) haeyo (해요) haseyo (하세요) (common), hasheoyo (하셔요) (rare) Informal and polite Used mainly between strangers, especially those older or of equal age. Traditionally used more by women than men, though in  Seoul  many men prefer this form to the Hapshoche (see above).   Haeche (해체) hae (해) (in speech), hayeo (하여) (in writing) hasheo(하셔) Informal, of neutral politeness or impolite Used most often between close friends and relatives, and when addressing younger people. It is  never  used between strangers unless the speaker wants to pick a fight.     Vocabulary   The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words. More than 50% of the vocabulary, however, is made up of  Sino-Korean  words, which are words borrowed from  Chinese , and traditionally written using  Hanja  ("

The U.S. Attorney's office now says Ingram was not in New York that day; he appeared the following day in a federal court in Flint, Mich.       Singletary story attribution     October 30, 2008 9:59 PM  In an Oct. 30 story on ESPN.com, the author of a story about San Francisco 49ers head coach Mike Singletary was incorrect. The story was compiled from various reports. Portions should have been attributed to the Santa Rosa Press-Democrat.   Updated story       Hornets-Warriors headline     October 30, 2008 1:17 PM  In an Oct. 29 story on ESPN.com, a headline on the NBA page incorrectly listed the categories in a double-double by New Orleans guard Chris Paul. Paul had 21 points and 11 assists in the win.   Updated story       Sponsorship of LPGA tournament     October 17, 2008 9:19 PM  In an Oct. 16 story on ESPN.com, The Associated Press reported erroneously that McDonald's would not be title sponsor of the LPGA Championship in 2009. McDonald's will no longer be the title sponsor starting in 2010. Also, the size of the season-ending ADT Championship is 32 players, not 30 players.   Updated story       Reason for Johnson being inactive     October 17, 2008 3:31 PM  In an Oct. 16 story on ESPN.com, the reason for Larry Johnson being inactive for a game against Tennessee was incorrectly stated initially. Johnson is inactive, but Chiefs head coach Herm Edwards said his decision had nothing to do with a charge of simple assault filed against Johnson earlier in the week.  Updated story       Letter to Raiders clarification     October 9, 2008 3:12 PM  In an Oct. 9 story on ESPN television and ESPN.com, information that indicated ESPN had confirmed facts regarding possible sanctions in a letter from the NFL to the Oakland Raiders was incorrectly characterized due to an editing error. The report should have indicated that ESPN confirmed the existence of a letter asking the Raiders to provide evidence of tampering.       Arizona-UCLA score     October 6, 2008 1:16 PM  In the October 6 issue of ESPN The Magazine, the score of the Sept. 20 Arizona-UCLA game should have read Arizona 31, UCLA 10 in the College Football Insider, page 98.

Please help  improve this article  by adding citations to  reliable sources .  Unverifiable  material may be challenged and removed.  (March 2007)       The  North-South differences in the Korean language  refers to the differences in the  Korean language  used in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea ( North Korea ; hereafter ""the North"") and the Republic of Korea ( South Korea ; ""the South."") From a linguistic point of view, the language used in the North and the South is one and the same. However, the length of time for which Korea has been divided has given rise to a number of small differences. Below are the language differences between the North and the South, centered around what is considered the standard language in each case.           Contents       1   Overview   2   Jamo     2.1   Jamo order       3   Pronunciation     3.1   Consonants   3.2   Vowels   3.3   Pitch       4   Orthography     4.1   Inflected words     4.1.1    /    4.1.2   -irregular inflections   4.1.3   Indication of tensed consonants after word endings that end with        4.2   Sino-Korean words     4.2.1   Initial  /  ( Dueum beopchik, ""initial sound rule"")   4.2.2   Hanja pronunciation       4.3   Compound words     4.3.1   Sai siot ( , ""middle "")   4.3.2   Word stems in compound words           5   Spacing     5.1   Bound nouns   5.2   Auxiliaries   5.3   Words indicating a single concept       6   Vocabulary     6.1   Differences due to the difference in political system or social structure   6.2   Differences in words of foreign origin   6.3   Other differences in vocabulary       7   See also               [ edit ]   Overview   Korean orthography , as defined by the  Korean Language Society  in 1933 in the ""Proposal for Unified Korean Orthography"" ( Hangul :     ;  RR :  Han-geul Matchumbeop Tong-iran ) had continued to be used by the North and the South after the end of  Japanese occupation of Korea , but with the establishments of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea in 1948, the two states have taken on differing policies regarding the language. In 1954, North Korea set out the rules for Korean orthography in  Hangul :    ;  RR :  Chosn Chljabp , and although this was only a minor revision in orthography that created little difference from that used in the South, from then on, what is considered the standard language in the North and the South gradually differed more and more from each other.   However, in the 1960s, under the influence of the  Juche  idea came a big change in linguistic policies in North Korea. On  3 January   1964 ,  Kim Il-sung  issued his teachings on ""A Number of Issues on the Development of the Korean language"" ( Korean :        ), and on  14 May   1966  on the topic ""In Rightly Advancing the Racial Characteristics of the Korean language"" ( Korean :          ), from which the ""Standard Korean Language"" ( Korean :   ) rules followed in the same year, issued by the National Language Revision Committee that was directly under the control of the cabinet. From then on, bigger differences have come about between the standard languages used in the North and the South. In 1987 North Korea revised the aforementioned rules further, and these have remained in use until today. In addition, the rules for spacing were separately laid out in the ""Standard Spacing Rules in Writing Korean"" ( Korean :    ) in 2000, but have since been superseded by ""Rules for Spacing in Writing Korean"" ( Korean :   ), issued in 2003.   South Korea continued to use the  Han-geul Matchumbeop Tong-iran  as defined in 1933, until its amendment ""Korean Orthography"" ( Hangul :    ;  RR :  Han-geul Matchumbeop ), together with ""Standard Language Regulations"" ( Korean :    ), were issued in 1988, which remain in use today.     [ edit ]   Jamo   The same  jamo  (letters) are used to write the language in the North and the South. However in the North, in writing the letter  is typically not written as a stroke added inside the letter , but as a stroke added above the letter .   In the South, the compound vowel  jamos  , , , , , , , , , ,  and the tensed consonants , , , ,  are not treated as separate  jamo , whereas in the North these are regarded as separate  jamo .   Some  jamo  have different names in the North and in the South.       Jamo   South Korean name   North Korean name                                                                                                               The names used in the South are the ones found in  Hunmongjahoe  (, , published 1527), whereas the names used in the North are formed mechanically with the pattern ""letter +  +  + letter"". Also for the tensed consonants, in the South they are called ""double"" (-) consonants, whereas in the North they are called ""strong"" (-) consonants.     [ edit ]   Jamo  order     Vowels       South:                         North:                             Consonants       South:                       North:                             In the North, diphthongs are treated as  jamo  in their own right and are put after the basic vowels, whereas in the South the diphthongs come between the basic vowels. For example, after    comes the diphthong   , the combination of    and   ; or after    come the diphthongs   ,    and   , which begin with   , and so on. Also with the consonant  jamo    , in the North, it is placed between    and    when pronounced as  ng , but placed after all consonants (i.e. after   ) when used as a placeholder indicating null initial consonant, for syllables that begin with a vowel.     [ edit ]   Pronunciation          Dialects of Korean       The standard languages in the North and the South share the same types and the same number of  phonemes , but there are some differences in the actual pronunciations. The South Korean standard pronunciation is based on the  dialect  as spoken in  Seoul , while the North Korean standard pronunciation is based on the  dialect  as spoken in  Pyongyang .     [ edit ]   Consonants   The following differences are recognised in the consonants. In the Seoul dialect, ,  and  are typically pronounced with alveolo-palatal affricates [  ], [  ], [  ], whereas in the Pyongyang dialect they are typically pronounced with alveolar affricates [  ], [  ], [  ]. Also,    and    can be pronounced without palatalisation as [ i ] and [ si ] in the Pyongyang dialect.   In Sino-Korean words, some of    and all of    that come in the beginning of a word are dropped in pronunciation and not written out in the South, whereas all initial    and    are written out in the North. For instance, the common last name  (often written out in English as Lee or Rhee, seemingly staying true to the North Korean typography and pronunciation), is written and pronounced as  in North Korean. Furthermore, the South Korean word , meaning woman, is similarly written as  in North Korea. But as this latter pronunciation was artificially crafted in the 1960s, it is not uncommon for older speakers to be unable to pronounce initial    and    properly, thus pronouncing such words in the same way as they are pronounced in the South.     [ edit ]   Vowels   The following differences are recognised in the vowels. The vowel  is not as rounded in the Seoul dialect as it is in the Pyongyang dialect. If expressed in  IPA , it would be [  ] for the one in Seoul dialect and [  ] for the one in Pyongyang dialect. Due to this  roundedness , speakers of the Seoul dialect would find that  as pronounced by speakers of the Pyongyang dialect sounds close to the vowel . Additionally, the difference between the vowels    and    is slowly diminishing amongst the younger speakers of the Seoul dialect. It is not well known if this is also happening with the Pyongyang dialect, but seeing that this is happening generally everywhere in South Korea, it is likely that this will also happen in North Korea.     [ edit ]   Pitch   The pitch patterns in the Seoul and Pyongyang dialects differ, but there has been little research in detail. On the other hand, in the  Chosnmal Taesajn'  (), published in 1992, where the pitches for certain words are shown in a three-pitch system, a word such as  (Korean nightingale) is marked as having pitch ""232"" (where ""2"" is low and ""3"" is high), from which one can see some difference in pitch patterns from the Seoul dialect. As an aside, while some find that the announcers on  Korean Central Television  speak as if they are roaring, this forceful way of speaking in an agitating tone is intentional and should not be considered as the typical way that Pyongyang dialect speakers speak.     [ edit ]   Orthography     [ edit ]   Inflected words     [ edit ]    /    In words where the word stem ends in , , , , , , in forms where - is appended to these endings in the South, - is instead appended in the North. In actual pronunciation, however, the  [j]  sound often accompanies the pronunciation of such words even in the South.       Inflected word   South inflection   North inflection   Meaning           ()      bloom                take out                strong           ()      become                jump                white         [ edit ]   -irregular inflections   When the word root of a -irregular inflected word has two syllables or more (for example, ), the vowel harmony is ignored in its inflections in the South, while it is kept in the North (as it also was in the South before the 1988  Han-geul Matchumbeop ). The vowel harmony is kept in both the South and the North if the word root has only one syllable (for example, ).       Inflected word   South inflection   North inflection   Meaning                thankful                near         [ edit ]   Indication of tensed consonants after word endings that end with    In word endings where the final consonant is , where the South spells - and - to indicate the tensed consonants, in the North these are spelt -- instead. These etymologically are formed by attaching to the adnominal form () that ends in , and in the North, the tensed consonants are denoted with normal consonants. Also, the word ending - used to be spelt - in the South, but has since been changed in the  Hangeul Matchumbeop  of 1988, and is now spelt - just like in the North.     [ edit ]   Sino-Korean words     [ edit ]   Initial  /  (  Dueum beopchik , ""initial sound rule"")   Initial  /  appearing in  Sino-Korean words  are kept in the North. In the South, in Sino-Korean words that begin with  and is followed by the vowel sound [i] or the semi-vowel sound [j] (i.e. when  is followed by one of , , , ,  and ),  is replaced by ; when this  is followed by other vowels it is replaced by . In the North, the initial  is kept.       South   North   Hanja                                                           Similarly, in Sino-Korean words that begin with  and is followed by the vowel sound [i] or the semi-vowel sound [j] (i.e. when  is followed by one of   ,   ,    and   ), in the South this  is replaced by , whereas this remains unchanged in the North.       South   North   Hanja                                 These are thus pronounced as written in the North as  and . However, even in the South, sometimes in order to disambiguate the surnames    () and    () from    () and    (), the former may be written or pronounced as    () and    ().     [ edit ]   Hanja pronunciation   Where a Hanja is written    or    in the South, this is written   ,    in the North (but even in the South these are pronounced   ,   ).       South   North   Hanja                                 Some hanja characters are pronounced differently.       South   North   Hanja                                 Also in the North, the hanja  is usually pronounced   , but (only) in the word  (""enemy""), this is pronounced   . It is thought that this is to avoid the word from being the same as  (""military general""), written as   .     [ edit ]   Compound words     [ edit ]   Sai siot ( , ""middle "")   When forming compound words from uninflected words, where the so-called ""sai siot"" is inserted in the South, this is left out in the North, but the pronunciation is the same as in the South.       South   North   Pronunciation   Meaning              /    chopsticks                  (tree) leaf         [ edit ]   Word stems in compound words   While the general rule is to write out the word stem from which the compound word is formed in its original form, in cases where the etymological origin is no longer remembered, this is no longer written in original form. This happens both in the North and in the South. However, whether a compound word is seen to have its etymological origin forgotten or not is seen differently by different people, and from this stem differences in the spellings of some words:       South   North   Meaning             upright             cherry blossom       In the first example, in the South the    part shows that the etymological origin is forgotten, and the word is written as pronounced as   , whereas in the North the first part is seen to come from    and thus the whole word is written    (pronounced the same as in the South). Conversely in the second example, the South spelling catches the word as the combination of    and   , whereas in the North this is no longer recognised and thus the word is written as pronounced as   .     [ edit ]   Spacing   In the South, the rules of spacing are not very clear-cut, whereas in the North, these are very precise. In summary, compared to the North, the writing in the South tends to include more spacing. The main differences are indicated below.     [ edit ]   Bound nouns   Before bound nouns (North:    ""incomplete nouns""; South:     ""dependent nouns""), a space is added in the South but not in the North. This applies to counter words also, but the space is sometimes allowed to be omitted in the South.       South   North   Meaning              my thing                to be able to do              one thing (counter word)         [ edit ]   Auxiliaries   Before auxiliaries, a space is inserted in the South but not in the North. Depending on the situation, however, the space may be omitted in the South.       South   North   Meaning              to try to eat              to seem to come              to be reading              to want to sleep       In the above, in the rules of the South, auxiliaries coming after  -/-  or an adnominal form allow the space before them to be omitted, while the space after  -  cannot be omitted.     [ edit ]   Words indicating a single concept   Words formed from two or more words that indicate a single concept in principle are written with spaces in the South and without spaces in the North. However, proper nouns and specialised words may also be written without spaces in the South.       South   North   Meaning              Korean dictionary               state of economic recovery                  Faculty of Humanities of Seoul National University       Note that since the spacing rules in the South are not very clearly defined, spellings vary from place to place. For example, taking the word    , people who see this as two words will add a space and people who see this as one word will write it without a space. Thus, the spacing depends on how one views what ""one word"" consists of, and hence in reality the spacing is not at all standardised in the South.     [ edit ]   Vocabulary   The standard language in the South (/) is largely based on the Seoul dialect, and the standard language (/) in the North is largely based on the Pyongyang dialect. However, both in the North and in the South, the vocabulary and forms of the standard language come from  Sajeonghan Joseoneo Pyojunmal Mo-eum      published by the Korean Language Society in 1936, and so essentially there is very little difference in the basic vocabulary between the standard languages used in the North and the South. Nevertheless, due to the difference in political systems and social structure, newly-created words give rise to differences in vocabulary, and the number of these looks to increase further in the future.     [ edit ]   Differences due to the difference in political system or social structure       South   North   Meaning       ()   ()   Korean Peninsula        ()   ()   Korean War       ()   ()   Primary school       ()      Friend       The word    that is used to mean ""friend"" in the North was originally a native Korean word used across the whole of Korea, but after the division of Korea, North Korea began to use it as a translation of the  Russian  term  (friend,  comrade ), and since then the word has come to mean ""comrade"" in the South as well and has fallen out of use there.     [ edit ]   Differences in words of foreign origin   South Korea has borrowed a lot of English words, whereas North Korea has borrowed a number of Russian words, and there are numerous differences in words used between the two coming from these different borrowings. Even for the same English word, how this word is transliterated into Korean is different in the North and the South, resulting in different words being adapted into the corresponding standard languages. For names of other nations and their places, the principle is to base the transliteration on the English word in the South, and to base the transliteration on the word in the original language in the North.       South   North   Meaning       Korean   Transliteration   Origin   Korean   Transliteration   Origin          teulaegteo   En.   tractor      ttlakttol   Ru.

Polska   Poland         [ edit ]   Other differences in vocabulary   The other differences between the standard languages in the North and in the South are thought to be due to the differences between the Seoul and Pyongyang dialects.       South   North   Meaning             corn             on, above             hammer       Words like    and    are also sometimes heard in various dialects in South Korea.   There are also some words that only exist in the North. The verb    (to break) and its passive form    (to be broken) have no exactly corresponding words in the South.

In South Korea, the language is most often called  Hangungmal  (  ;   ), or more formally,  Hangugeo  (  ;   ) or  Gugeo  (  ;   ; literally ""national language"").   In North Korea and Yanbian in China, the language is most often called  Chosnmal  (  ; with  hanja :   ), or more formally,  Chosn  (  ;   ).   On the other hand, Korean people in the  former USSR , who refer to themselves as  Koryo-saram  (also  Goryeoin  [  ;   ; literally, "" Goryeo  person(s)""]) call the language  Goryeomal  (  ;   ).   In  mainland China , following the establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992, the term  Choxiny  (   or short form:  Choy  (  )) has normally been used to refer to the language spoken in North Korea and Yanbian, while  Hnguy  (   or short form:  Hny  (  )) is used to refer to the language spoken in South Korea.   Some older English sources also used the name ""Korean"" to refer to the language, country, and people.     [ edit ]   History       Main article:  History of the Korean language       Korean is descended from  Old Korean  and  Middle Korean .     [ edit ]   Classification   The classification of the modern Korean language is uncertain, and due to the lack of any one generally accepted theory, it is sometimes described conservatively as a  language isolate .   On the other hand, since the publication of the article of  Ramstedt  in 1926, many linguists support the hypothesis that Korean can be classified as an  Altaic  language, or as a relative of proto-Altaic. Korean is similar to Altaic languages in that they both lack certain grammatical elements, including  number ,  gender ,  articles , fusional morphology, voice, and  relative pronouns  (Kim Namkil). Korean especially bears some  morphological  resemblance to some languages of the Northern Turkic group, namely  Sakha (Yakut) . Vinokurova, a scholar of the Sakha language, noted that like in Korean, and unlike in other  Turkic languages  or a variety of other languages surveyed, adverbs in Sakha are derived from verbs with the help of derivational morphology; however, she did not suggest this implied any relation between the two languages. [ 2 ]   It is also considered likely that Korean is related in some way to  Japanese , since the two languages have nearly identical grammatical structures, and share a number of possible phonological cognates (though a majority of them are likely due to local pronunciations of the Chinese characters from which they are derived), as noted by such researchers as  Samuel E. Martin  and  Roy Andrew Miller  in the late 1960s.  Sergei Starostin  (1991) found about 25% of potential cognates in the Japanese-Korean 100-word  Swadesh list , which places these two languages closer together than other possible members of the Altaic family. [ 3 ]   Genetic relationships have been postulated both directly and indirectly, the latter either through placing both languages in the Altaic family, or by arguing for a relationship between Japanese and the  Buyeo languages  of  Goguryeo  and  Baekje  (see below); the proposed Baekje relationship is supported by cognates such as Baekje  mir , Japanese  mi-  ""three"". [ 4 ]   The possible relationship between Korean and Japanese can be exemplified by such basic vocabularly items as J.     mizu  (Old J.  midu ) : K.     mul  (Middle K.  mirh ) ""water"",  mot  ""lake""; J.     ku-ru  ""come"" (Old J.  ku , also cf. irregular root changes as in past tense   ki-ta , negative   ko-nai  in Modern J.) : K.     ka-da  (""go""); J.     kata-i  ""hard"" (whence     kata-na  ""knife, sword"") : K.  kud-yn  (hard); J.     i-ru  ""to be"" (past tense   i-ta ) : K.     i-da  ""to be""; J.  na ,  -en  : K.  anh  ""not"", J.  minna  (Old J.  mynna ) ""all, everyone"" : K.  manh-  ""many"" (predicate  mana-da ), etc.  [ 5 ] . The same possible cognates are often observed in other members of the potential  Altaic family , esp. in the  Tungusic languages . Cf. Nanay  mue  ""water"",  giagda-  ""to walk"",  anaa, anna  ""not"".   Others argue, however, that the similarities are not due to any genetic relationship, but rather to a  sprachbund  effect. See  East Asian languages  for morphological features shared among languages of the East Asian  sprachbund , and  Japanese language classification  for further details on the possible relationship.   It is presumed that modern Korean may be more closely related to the languages of  Samhan  and  Silla  than the Buyeo languages; many Korean scholars believe they were mutually intelligible, and the collective basis of what in the  Goryeo  period would merge to become Middle Korean (the language before the changes that the  Seven-Year War  brought) and eventually Modern Korean. The  Jeju dialect  preserves some archaic features that can also be found in Middle Korean, whose  arae a  is retained in the dialect as a distinct vowel.   There are also more marginal hypotheses proposing various other relationships; for example, a few scholars, such as  Homer B. Hulbert  (1905), have tried to relate Korean to the  Dravidian languages  through the similar syntax in both. [ 6 ]   Though not related to Chinese, it has borrowed heavily; see the Vocabulary section below.     [ edit ]   Dialects       Main article:  Korean dialects              Dialects of Korean       Korean has several  dialects  (called  mal  [literally ""speech""],  saturi , or  bang-eon  in Korean). The  standard language  ( pyojuneo  or  pyojunmal ) of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  P'yngyang . These dialects are similar, and are in fact all mutually intelligible, perhaps with the exception of the dialect of  Jeju Island  (see  Jeju dialect ). The dialect spoken in Jeju is in fact classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of  Seoul dialect  use very little stress, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of the  Gyeongsang dialect  have a very pronounced intonation.   It is also worth noting that there is substantial evidence for a history of extensive  dialect levelling , or even  convergent evolution  or intermixture of two or more originally distinct linguistic stocks, within the Korean language and its dialects. Many Korean dialects have basic vocabulary that is etymologically distinct from vocabulary of identical meaning in Standard Korean or other dialects, such as South Jeolla dialect /kur/ vs. Standard Korean     /ip/  ""mouth"" or Gyeongsang dialect  /.u.i/  vs. Standard Korean  /puu/  "" garlic chives ."" This suggests that the Korean Peninsula may have at one time been much more linguistically diverse than it is at present. [ citation needed ]  See also the  Buyeo languages   hypothesis .   There is a very close connection between the dialects of Korean and the  regions of Korea , since the boundaries of both are largely determined by mountains and seas. Here is a list of traditional dialect names and locations:       Standard dialect   Where used       Seoul   Seoul  (),  Incheon  (/), most of  Gyeonggi  (/)       P'yngan  (/)   P'yngyang ,  P'yngan  region,  Chagang  (North Korea)       Regional dialect   Where used       Gyeonggi   limited areas of the  Gyeonggi  region (South Korea)       Chungcheong   Daejeon ,  Chungcheong  region (South Korea)       Gangwon   Gangwon-do (South Korea) / Kangwn (North Korea)       Gyeongsang   Busan ,  Daegu ,  Ulsan ,  Gyeongsang  region (South Korea)       Hamgyng   Rasn ,  Hamgyng  region,  Ryanggang  (North Korea)       Hwanghae   Hwanghae  region (North Korea)       Jeju   Jeju Island/Province  (South Korea)       Jeolla   Gwangju ,  Jeolla  region (South Korea)         [ edit ]   Phonology       This article contains  IPA  phonetic symbols.

Main article:  Korean phonology         [ edit ]   Consonants          The Korean consonants             Bilabial   Alveolar   Post-  alveolar   Velar   Glottal       Nasal      /m/      /n/        //  (syllable-final)         Plosive  and   Affricate   plain      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         tense      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         aspirated      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         Fricative   plain        /s/          /h/       tense        /s/             Liquid        /l/           The  IPA  symbol <  > (a subscript double straight quotation mark, shown here with a placeholder circle) is used to denote the tensed consonants  /p/, /t/, /k/, //, /s/ . Its official use in the  Extensions to the IPA  is for  'strong'  articulation, but is used in the literature for  faucalized voice . The Korean consonants also have elements of  stiff voice , but it is not yet known how typical this is of faucalized consonants. They are produced with a partially constricted  glottis  and additional subglottal pressure in addition to tense vocal tract walls, laryngeal lowering, or other expansion of the larynx.     [ edit ]   Vowels                    The Korean basic vowels                 Monophthongs   /i/    ,  /e/    ,  //    ,  /a/    ,  /o/    ,  /u/    ,  //    ,  //    ,  //          Vowels preceded by intermediaries,  or Diphthongs   /je/    ,  /j/    ,  /ja/    ,  /wi/    ,  /we/    ,  /w/    ,  /wa/    ,  /i/    ,  /jo/    ,  /ju/    ,  /j/    ,  /w/            [ edit ]   Allophones   /s/  becomes an  alveolo-palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i]  for most speakers (but see  Differences in the language between North Korea and South Korea ). This occurs with the tense fricative and all the affricates as well. At the end of a syllable, /s/ changes to /t/ (Example: beoseot () 'mushroom').   /h/  may become a  bilabial   []  before  [o]  or  [u] , a  palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i] , a  velar   [x]  before  [] , a voiced  []  between voiced sounds, and a  [h]  elsewhere. [ citation needed ]   /p, t, , k/  become voiced  [b, d, , ]  between voiced sounds.   /l/  becomes alveolar flap  []  between vowels, and  [l]  or  []  at the end of a syllable or next to another  /l/ . Note that a written syllable-final '', when followed by a vowel or a glide ( i.e. , when the next character starts with ''), migrates to the next syllable and thus becomes  [] .   Traditionally,  /l/  was disallowed at the beginning of a word. It disappeared before  [j] , and otherwise became  /n/ . However, the inflow of western loanword changed the trend, and now word-initial  /l/  (mostly from English loanwords) are pronounced as a free variation of either  []  or  [l] . The traditional prohibition of word-initial  /l/  became a morphological rule called ""initial law"" () in South Korea, which pertains to Sino-Korean vocabulary. Such words retain their word-initial  /l/  in North Korea.   All  obstruents  (plosives, affricates, fricatives) are  unreleased   [p, t, k]  at the end of a word.   Plosive stops  /p, t, k/  become nasal stops  [m, n, ]  before nasal stops.   Hangul  spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying, partly historical  morphology . Given this, it is sometimes hard to tell which actual phonemes are present in a certain word.   One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial  [r] , and initial  [n] . For example,     ""labour"" - north:  r odong  (), south:  n odong  ()   ""history"" - north:  ry ksa  (), south:  y eoksa  ()   ""female"" - north:  ny ja  (), south:  y eoja  ()       [ edit ]   Morphophonemics   Grammatical morphemes may change shape depending on the preceding sounds. Examples include  -eun/-neun  (-/-) and  -i/-ga  (-/-). Sometimes sounds may be inserted instead. Examples include  -eul/-reul  (-/-),  -euro/-ro  (-/-),  -eseo/-seo  (-/-),  -ideunji/-deunji  (-/-) and  -iya/-ya  (-/-). However,  -euro/-ro  is somewhat irregular, since it will behave differently after a rieul consonant.

[ edit ]   Grammar       Main article:  Korean grammar         [ edit ]   Sentence structure   Korean is an  agglutinative language . Modifiers generally follow the modified word, and in the case of verb modifiers, can be serially appended. The basic form of a Korean sentence is  Subject Object Verb , but the verb is the only required and immovable element.       A :       -       -? (?)           gage-e     gasseo-yo           store + [location marker ()]     [go (verb root) ()]+[conjunctive ()]+[past ()]+[conjunctive ()]+ [interrogative marker ()]         ""Did [you] go to the store?"" (with ""you"" implied by context)         B :       .           ne           yes         ""Yes.""       [ edit ]   Parts of speech     [ edit ]   Verb   Korean  verbs  (  ,  dongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""action verbs"" or ""dynamic verbs"" to distinguish them from [  () ,  hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""]), which are also known as ""descriptive verbs"" or ""stative verbs"". Examples of action/dynamic verbs include    ( hada , ""to do, to have"") and    ( gada , ""to go"") which constitute an action or movement as opposed to descriptive verbs such as    ( yehppeuda , ""to be beautiful""). For a larger list of Korean verbs, see  wikt:Category:Korean verbs .   Unlike most of the European languages, Korean does not conjugate verbs using agreement with the subject, and nouns have no gender. Instead, verb conjugations depend upon the verb tense, aspect, mood, and the social relation between the speaker, the subjects, and the listeners. The system of speech levels and honorifics loosely resembles the  T-V distinction  of most  Indo-European languages . For example, different endings are used based on whether the subjects and listeners are friends, parents, or honoured persons.     [ edit ]   Adjective   Words categorized as Korean  adjectives  (  ,  hyeong-yongsa ,   ) conjugate similarly to verbs, so some English texts call them ""descriptive verbs"" or "" stative verbs "", but they are distinctly separate from    ( dongsa ).   English does not have an identical grammatical category, so the English translation of Korean adjectives may misleadingly suggest that they are verbs. For example,    ( bukda ) translates literally as ""to be red"" and    ( aswipda ) often best translates as ""to lack"" or ""to want for"", but both are    ( hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""). For a larger list of Korean adjectives, see  wikt:Category:Korean adjectives .     [ edit ]   Determiner   Korean  determiners  (  ,  gwanhyeongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""determinatives"", ""adnominals"", ""pre-nouns"", ""attributives"", and ""unconjugated adjectives"". Examples include    ( gak , ""each""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean determiners .     [ edit ]   Noun   A large body of Korean  nouns  (  ,  myeongsa ,   ) stem from  Chinese characters , e.g.    (,  san , mountain),    (,  yeok , station),    (,  munhwa , culture), etc. Others are native to the Korean language, e.g.    ( nara , country),    ( nal , day). Many  Sino-Korean words  have a native Korean equivalent and vice versa, but not always. Nouns do not have  grammatical gender  and can be made  plural  by adding  to the end of the word, however in most instances the  singular  form is used even when in English it would be translated as plural. For example, while in English the sentence  ""there are three apples""  would use the plural  ""apples""  instead of the singular  ""apple"" , the Korean sentence    ( sagwa segae isssumnida ) maintains the word  ( sagwa , ""apple"") in its singular form, thus rendered in English as ""apple three(things) exist."" For a list of Korean nouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean nouns .     [ edit ]   Pronoun       Main article:  Korean pronouns       Korean  pronouns  (  ,  daemyeongsa ,   ) are highly influenced by the honorifics in the language. Pronouns change forms depending on the social status of the person or persons spoken to, e.g. the pronoun for ""I"" there is both the informal    ( na ) and the honorific/humble    ( jeo ). In general second person singular pronouns are avoided, especially when using honorific forms. For a larger list or Korean pronouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean pronouns .     [ edit ]   Adverb   Korean  adverbs  (  ,  busa ,   ) include    ( tto , ""also"") and    ( gadeuk , ""fully""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean adverbs .     [ edit ]   Particle   Korean  particles  (  ,  josa ,   ) are also known in English as "" postpositions "". Examples include    ( neun , topic marker) and    ( reul , object marker). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean particles .     [ edit ]   Interjection   Korean  interjections  (  ,  gamtansa ,   ) are also known in English as ""exclamations"". Examples include    ( ani , ""no""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean interjections .     [ edit ]   Number       Main article:  Korean numerals       Korean  numbers  or numerals (  ,  sutja ,   ) consitute two regularly used sets: a native Korean set and a  Sino-Korean  set. The Sino-Korean system is nearly entirely based on the  Chinese numerals . The distinction between the two numeral systems is very important. Everything that can be counted will use one of the two systems, but seldom both. Sino-Korean words are sometimes used to mark ordinal usage: yeol beon ( ) means ""ten times"" while sip beon (() ()) means ""number ten."" The grouping of large numbers in Korean follow the Chinese tradition of myriads (10000) rather than thousands (1000) as is common in Europe and North America.     [ edit ]   Speech levels and honorifics       Main article:  Korean honorifics       The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean, and the grammar reflects this. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject referent is reflected in  honorifics , while that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in  speech level .     [ edit ]   Honorifics   When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a younger stranger, student, employee or the like. Nowadays, there are special endings which can be used on declarative, interrogative, and imperative sentences; and both honorific or normal sentences. They are made for easier and faster use of Korean.     [ edit ]   Speech levels   There are seven verb  paradigms  or  speech levels  in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation. [ citation needed ]  Unlike  honorifics   which are used to show respect towards the referent   speech levels  are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience. The names of the 7 levels are derived from the non-honorific  imperative  form of the verb    ( hada , ""do"") in each level, plus the suffix  ('che',  hanja :   ), which means ""style.""   The highest 6 levels are generally grouped together as  jondaenmal  (), while the lowest level ( haeche , ) is called  banmal  () in Korean.     [ edit ]   Vocabulary   The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words. Like Japanese and Vietnamese, more than 50% of the vocabulary (up to 60% by some estimates), especially words that denote abstract ideas, are  Sino-Korean words , [ 7 ]  either     directly borrowed from  Written Chinese , or   coined in Japan or Korea using  Chinese characters ,     in a similar way European languages borrow from Latin and Greek. Korean has two  number systems : one native, and one borrowed from Chinese.   To a much lesser extent, words have also occasionally been borrowed from  Mongolian ,  Sanskrit , and other languages. Conversely, the Korean language itself has also contributed some loanwords to other languages, most notably the  Tsushima dialect  of Japanese.   The vast majority of loanwords other than Sino-Korean come from modern times, 90% of which are from  English . [ 8 ]  Many words have also been borrowed from  Japanese  and  Western languages  such as  German  ( areubaiteu  part-time job,  allereugi  allergy). Some Western words were borrowed indirectly via Japanese, taking a Japanese sound pattern, for example dozen >     dsu  >     daseu . Most indirect Western borrowings are now written according to current Hangulization rules for the respective Western language, as if borrowed directly. There are a few more complicated borrowings such as German(y) (see  Names for Germany ), the first part of whose  endonym   [d.lant]  the Japanese approximated using the  kanji      doitsu  that were then accepted into the Korean language by their Sino-Korean pronunciation:     dok  +     il  =  Dogil . In South Korean official use, a number of other Sino-Korean country names have been replaced with phonetically oriented Hangulizations of the countries' endonyms or English names.   North Korean vocabulary shows a tendency to prefer native Korean over Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings, especially with recent political objectives aimed at eliminating foreign (mostly Chinese) influences on the Korean language in the North. By contrast, South Korean may have several Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings which tend to be absent in North Korean.     [ edit ]   Writing system       Korean writing systems           Hangul       Hanja       Hyangchal   Gugyeol   Idu       Mixed script       Korean romanization       Revised Romanization of Korean   McCune-Reischauer   Yale Romanization               Main article:  Hangul     See also:  Hangul consonant and vowel tables     In ancient times, the languages of the Korean peninsula were written using  Chinese characters , using  hyangchal  or  idu . Such systems were not popular because hanja is not well suited to the Korean language. Its use limited some cases and the aristocracy prefers  Classical Chinese  for its writing.   Korean is now mainly written in Hangul, the Korean alphabet promulgated in 1446 by  Sejong the Great ;  hanja may be mixed in  to write  Sino-Korean words . South Korea still teaches 1800 hanja characters in its schools, while the North abolished the use of hanja decades ago.   Below is a chart of the Korean alphabet's symbols and their canonical  IPA  values:     Consonants     Hangul                                                                        RR   b , p   d , t   j   g , k   pp   tt   jj   kk   p   t   ch   k   s   h   ss   m   n   ng       r , l           IPA   p   t      k   p   t      k   p   t      k   s   h   s   m   n      w   r   j         Vowels     Hangul                                                                      RR   i   e   oe   ae   a   o   u   eo   eu   ui   ye   yae   ya   yo   yu   yeo   wi   we   wae   wa   wo       IPA   i   e         a   o   u         i   je   j   ja   jo   ju   j   wi   we   w   wa   w       Modern Korean is written with  spaces  between  words , a feature not found in Chinese or Japanese. Korean  punctuation  marks are almost identical to Western ones. Traditionally, Korean was written in columns from top to bottom, right to left, but is now usually written in rows from left to right, top to bottom.     [ edit ]   Differences between North Korean and South Korean       Main article:  Korean language North-South differences       The Korean language used in the North and the South exhibits differences in pronunciation, spelling, grammar and vocabulary. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Pronunciation   In North Korea,  palatalization  of  /si/  is optional, and  //  can be pronounced as  [z]  in between vowels.   Words that are written the same way may be pronounced differently, such as the examples below.

(In the South, this rule only applies when it is attached to any single-character Sino-Korean word.)

[ edit ]   Spelling and pronunciation   Some words have different spellings and pronunciations in the North and the South, some of which were given in the ""Phonology"" section above:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          ryeongryang (ryngryang)      yeongnyang (yngnyang)   strength   Korean words originally starting in  r  or  n  have their  r  or  n  dropped in the South Korean version if the sound following it is an  i  or  y  sound.          rodong (rodong)      nodong (nodong)   work   Korean words originally starting in  r  have their  r  changed to  n  in the South Korean version if the sound following it is a sound other than  i  or  y .          wonssu (wnssu)      wonsu (wnsu)   mortal enemy   ""Mortal enemy"" and ""head of state"" are homophones in the South. Possibly to avoid referring to  Kim Il-sung  /  Kim Jong-il  as the enemy, the second syllable of ""enemy"" is written and pronounced  in the North.          rajio (rajio)      radio (radio)   radio            u (u)      wi (wi)   on; above            anhae (anhae)      anae (anae)   wife            kkuba (kkuba)      kuba (k'uba)   Cuba   When transcribing foreign words from languages that do not have contrasts between aspirated and unaspirated stops, North Koreans generally use tensed stops for the unaspirated ones while South Koreans use aspirated stops in both cases.          pe (p'e)      pye (p'ye), pe (p'e)   lungs   All hanja pronounced as  pye  ( p'ye ) or  pe  ( p'e ) in the South are pronounced as  pe  ( p'e ) in the North. The spelling is also accordingly different.       In general, when transcribing place names, North Korea tends to use the pronunciation in the original language more than South Korea, which often uses the pronunciation in English.

[ edit ]   Study by non-native speakers   The  United States '  Defense Language Institute  classifies Korean alongside  Arabic ,  Chinese , and  Japanese  as a Category IV language, meaning that 63 weeks of instruction (as compared to just 25 weeks for  French ,  Spanish ,  Portuguese , and  Italian ) are required to bring an English-speaking student to a limited working level of proficiency in which he or she has ""sufficient capability to meet routine social demands and limited job requirements"" and ""can deal with concrete topics in past, present, and future tense."" [ 10 ]  As a result, the study of the Korean language in the United States is dominated by  Korean American  heritage language students; they are estimated to form over 80% of all students of the language at non-military universities. [ 11 ]   However, Korean is considerably easier for speakers of certain other languages, such as Japanese, Mongolian and Turkic languages; in Japan, it is more widely studied by non-heritage learners. [ 12 ]  The  Korean Language Proficiency Test , an examination aimed at assessing non-native speakers' competence in Korean, was instituted in 1997; 17,000 people applied for the 2005 sitting of the examination.

Korean  (  /  , see  below ) is the official  language  of  North Korea  and  South Korea . It is also one of the two official languages in the  Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture  in  China . There are about 78 million Korean speakers. It was formerly written using  Hanja , borrowed  Chinese characters  pronounced in the Korean way. In the 15th century a national writing system was developed by  Sejong the Great , nowadays called  Hangul .   The genealogical  classification  of the Korean language is debated. Some linguists place it in the  Altaic  language family, while others consider it to be a  language isolate . It is  agglutinative  in its morphology and  SOV  in its  syntax .

In South Korea, the language is most often called  Hangungmal  (  ;   ), or more formally,  Hangugeo  (  ;   ) or  Gugeo  (  ;   ; literally ""national language"").   In North Korea and Yanbian in China, the language is most often called  Chosnmal  (  ; with  hanja :   ), or more formally,  Chosn  (  ;   ).   On the other hand, Korean people in the  former USSR , who refer to themselves as  Koryo-saram  (also  Goryeoin  [  ;   ; literally, "" Goryeo  person(s)""]) call the language  Goryeomal  (  ;   ).   In  mainland China , following the establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992, the term  Choxiny  (   or short form:  Choy  (  )) has normally been used to refer to the language spoken in North Korea and Yanbian, while  Hnguy  (   or short form:  Hny  (  )) is used to refer to the language spoken in South Korea.   Some older English sources also used the name ""Korean"" to refer to the language, country, and people.     [ edit ]   History   Main article:  History of the Korean language   Korean is descended from  Old Korean  and  Middle Korean .     [ edit ]   Classification   The classification of the modern Korean language is uncertain, and due to the lack of any one generally accepted theory, it is sometimes described conservatively as a  language isolate .   On the other hand, since the publication of the article of  Ramstedt  in 1926, many linguists support the hypothesis that Korean can be classified as an  Altaic  language, or as a relative of proto-Altaic. Korean is similar to Altaic languages in that they both lack certain grammatical elements, including  number ,  gender ,  articles , fusional morphology, voice, and  relative pronouns  (Kim Namkil). Korean especially bears some  morphological  resemblance to some languages of the Northern Turkic group, namely  Sakha (Yakut) . Vinokurova, a scholar of the Sakha language, noted that like in Korean, and unlike in other  Turkic languages  or a variety of other languages surveyed, adverbs in Sakha are derived from verbs with the help of derivational morphology; however, she did not suggest this implied any relation between the two languages. [ 2 ]   It is also considered likely that Korean is related in some way to  Japanese , since the two languages have nearly identical grammatical structures, and share a number of possible phonological cognates (though a majority of them are likely due to local pronunciations of the Chinese characters from which they are derived), as noted by such researchers as  Samuel E. Martin  and  Roy Andrew Miller  in the late 1960s.  Sergei Starostin  (1991) found about 25% of potential cognates in the Japanese-Korean 100-word  Swadesh list , which places these two languages closer together than other possible members of the Altaic family. [ 3 ]   Genetic relationships have been postulated both directly and indirectly, the latter either through placing both languages in the Altaic family, or by arguing for a relationship between Japanese and the  Buyeo languages  of  Goguryeo  and  Baekje  (see below); the proposed Baekje relationship is supported by cognates such as Baekje  mir , Japanese  mi-  ""three"". [ 4 ]   The possible relationship between Korean and Japanese can be exemplified by such basic vocabularly items as J.     mizu  (Old J.  midu ) : K.     mul  (Middle K.  mirh ) ""water"",  mot  ""lake""; J.     ku-ru  ""come"" (Old J.  ku , also cf. irregular root changes as in past tense   ki-ta , negative   ko-nai  in Modern J.) : K.     ka-da  (""go""); J.     kata-i  ""hard"" (whence     kata-na  ""knife, sword"") : K.  kud-yn  (hard); J.     i-ru  ""to be"" (past tense   i-ta ) : K.     i-da  ""to be""; J.  na ,  -en  : K.  anh  ""not"", J.  minna  (Old J.  mynna ) ""all, everyone"" : K.  manh-  ""many"" (predicate  mana-da ), etc.  [ 5 ] . The same possible cognates are often observed in other members of the potential  Altaic family , esp. in the  Tungusic languages . Cf. Nanay  mue  ""water"",  giagda-  ""to walk"",  anaa, anna  ""not"".   Others argue, however, that the similarities are not due to any genetic relationship, but rather to a  sprachbund  effect. [ citation needed ]  See  East Asian languages  for morphological features shared among languages of the East Asian  sprachbund , and  Classification of Japanese  for further details on the possible relationship. Though it is very difficult to believe words such as ""water"", ""to be"", and ""to go"" arise from sprachbund effects.   It is presumed that modern Korean may be more closely related to the languages of  Samhan  and  Silla  than the Buyeo languages; many Korean scholars believe they were mutually intelligible, and the collective basis of what in the  Goryeo  period would merge to become Middle Korean (the language before the changes that the  Seven-Year War  brought) and eventually Modern Korean. The  Jeju dialect  preserves some archaic features that can also be found in Middle Korean, whose  arae a  is retained in the dialect as a distinct vowel.   There are also more marginal hypotheses proposing various other relationships; for example, a few scholars, such as  Homer B. Hulbert  (1905), have tried to relate Korean to the  Dravidian languages  through the similar syntax in both. [ 6 ]   Though not related to Chinese, it has borrowed heavily; see the Vocabulary section below.     [ edit ]   Dialects   Main article:  Korean dialects          Dialects of Korean       Korean has several  dialects  (called  mal  [literally ""speech""],  saturi , or  bang-eon  in Korean). The  standard language  ( pyojuneo  or  pyojunmal ) of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  P'yngyang . All dialects of Korean are similar to each other, and are in fact all mutually intelligible, perhaps with the exception of the dialect of  Jeju Island  (see  Jeju dialect ). The dialect spoken in Jeju is in fact classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of  Seoul dialect  use very little stress, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of the  Gyeongsang dialect  have a very pronounced intonation.   It is also worth noting that there is substantial evidence for a history of extensive  dialect levelling , or even  convergent evolution  or intermixture of two or more originally distinct linguistic stocks, within the Korean language and its dialects. Many Korean dialects have basic vocabulary that is etymologically distinct from vocabulary of identical meaning in Standard Korean or other dialects, such as South Jeolla dialect /kur/ vs. Standard Korean     /ip/  ""mouth"" or Gyeongsang dialect  /.u.i/  vs. Standard Korean  /puu/  "" garlic chives ."" This suggests that the Korean Peninsula may have at one time been much more linguistically diverse than it is at present. See also the  Buyeo languages   hypothesis .   There is a very close connection between the dialects of Korean and the  regions of Korea , since the boundaries of both are largely determined by mountains and seas. Here is a list of traditional dialect names and locations:       Standard dialect   Where used       Seoul   Seoul  (),  Incheon  (/), most of  Gyeonggi  (/)       P'yngan  (/)   P'yngyang ,  P'yngan  region,  Chagang  (North Korea)       Regional dialect   Where used       Gyeonggi   limited areas of the  Gyeonggi  region (South Korea)       Chungcheong   Daejeon ,  Chungcheong  region (South Korea)       Gangwon   Gangwon-do (South Korea) / Kangwn (North Korea)       Gyeongsang   Busan ,  Daegu ,  Ulsan ,  Gyeongsang  region (South Korea)       Hamgyng   Rasn ,  Hamgyng  region,  Ryanggang  (North Korea)       Hwanghae   Hwanghae  region (North Korea)       Jeju   Jeju Island/Province  (South Korea)       Jeolla   Gwangju ,  Jeolla  region (South Korea)         [ edit ]   Phonology       This article contains  IPA  phonetic symbols.

Main article:  Korean phonology     [ edit ]   Consonants          The Korean consonants             Bilabial   Alveolar   Post-  alveolar   Velar   Glottal       Nasal      /m/      /n/        //  (syllable-final)         Plosive  and   Affricate   plain      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         tense      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         aspirated      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         Fricative   plain        /s/          /h/       tense        /s/             Liquid        /l/           The  IPA  symbol <  > (a subscript double straight quotation mark, shown here with a placeholder circle) is used to denote the tensed consonants  /p/, /t/, /k/, //, /s/ . Its official use in the  Extensions to the IPA  is for  'strong'  articulation, but is used in the literature for  faucalized voice . The Korean consonants also have elements of  stiff voice , but it is not yet known how typical this is of faucalized consonants. They are produced with a partially constricted  glottis  and additional subglottal pressure in addition to tense vocal tract walls, laryngeal lowering, or other expansion of the larynx.     [ edit ]   Vowels                    The Korean basic vowels                 Monophthongs   /i/    ,  /e/    ,  //    ,  /a/    ,  /o/    ,  /u/    ,  //    ,  //    ,  //          Vowels preceded by intermediaries,  or Diphthongs   /je/    ,  /j/    ,  /ja/    ,  /wi/    ,  /we/    ,  /w/    ,  /wa/    ,  /i/    ,  /jo/    ,  /ju/    ,  /j/    ,  /w/            [ edit ]   Allophones   /s/  becomes an  alveolo-palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i]  for most speakers (but see  Differences in the language between North Korea and South Korea ). This occurs with the tense fricative and all the affricates as well. At the end of a syllable, /s/ changes to /t/ (Example: beoseot () 'mushroom').   /h/  may become a  bilabial   []  before  [o]  or  [u] , a  palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i] , a  velar   [x]  before  [] , a voiced  []  between voiced sounds, and a  [h]  elsewhere. [ citation needed ]   /p, t, , k/  become voiced  [b, d, , ]  between voiced sounds.   /l/  becomes alveolar flap  []  between vowels, and  [l]  or  []  at the end of a syllable or next to another  /l/ . Note that a written syllable-final '', when followed by a vowel or a glide ( i.e. , when the next character starts with ''), migrates to the next syllable and thus becomes  [] .   Traditionally,  /l/  was disallowed at the beginning of a word. It disappeared before  [j] , and otherwise became  /n/ . However, the inflow of western loanword changed the trend, and now word-initial  /l/  (mostly from English loanwords) are pronounced as a free variation of either  []  or  [l] . The traditional prohibition of word-initial  /l/  became a morphological rule called ""initial law"" () in South Korea, which pertains to Sino-Korean vocabulary. Such words retain their word-initial  /l/  in North Korea.   All  obstruents  (plosives, affricates, fricatives) are  unreleased   [p, t, k]  at the end of a word.   Plosive stops  /p, t, k/  become nasal stops  [m, n, ]  before nasal stops.   Hangul  spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying, partly historical  morphology . Given this, it is sometimes hard to tell which actual phonemes are present in a certain word.   One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial  [r] , and initial  [n] . For example,     ""labour"" - north:  r odong  (), south:  n odong  ()   ""history"" - north:  ry ksa  (), south:  y eoksa  ()   ""female"" - north:  ny ja  (), south:  y eoja  ()       [ edit ]   Morphophonemics   Grammatical morphemes may change shape depending on the preceding sounds. Examples include  -eun/-neun  (-/-) and  -i/-ga  (-/-). Sometimes sounds may be inserted instead. Examples include  -eul/-reul  (-/-),  -euro/-ro  (-/-),  -eseo/-seo  (-/-),  -ideunji/-deunji  (-/-) and  -iya/-ya  (-/-). However,  -euro/-ro  is somewhat irregular, since it will behave differently after a rieul consonant.     Korean particles     After a consonant   After a rieul   After a vowel       -ui  (-)       -eun  (-)   -neun  (-)       -i  (-)   -ga  (-)       -eul  (-)   -reul  (-)       -gwa  (-)   -wa  (-)       -euro  (-)   -ro  (-)       Some verbs may also change shape morphophonemically.     [ edit ]   Grammar   Main article:  Korean grammar     [ edit ]   Sentence structure   Korean is an  agglutinative language . Modifiers generally follow the modified word, and in the case of verb modifiers, can be serially appended. The basic form of a Korean sentence is  Subject Object Verb , but the verb is the only required and immovable element.       A :       -       -? (?)           kage-e     kasseo-yo           store + [location marker ()]     [go (verb root) ()]+[conjunctive ()]+[past ()]+[conjunctive ()]+ [polite marker ()]         ""Did [you] go to the store?"" (with ""you"" implied by context)         B :       .           ye           yes         ""Yes.""       [ edit ]   Parts of speech     [ edit ]   Verb   Korean  verbs  (  ,  tongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""action verbs"" or ""dynamic verbs"" to distinguish them from [  () ,  hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""]), which are also known as ""descriptive verbs"" or ""stative verbs"". Examples of action/dynamic verbs include    ( hada , ""to do"") and    ( kada , ""to go"") which constitute an action or movement as opposed to descriptive verbs such as    ( yehppeuda , ""to be beautiful""). For a larger list of Korean verbs, see  wikt:Category:Korean verbs .   Unlike most of the European languages, Korean does not conjugate verbs using agreement with the subject, and nouns have no gender. Instead, verb conjugations depend upon the verb tense, aspect, mood, and the social relation between the speaker, the subjects, and the listeners. The system of speech levels and honorifics loosely resembles the  T-V distinction  of most  Indo-European languages . For example, different endings are used based on the speaker's relation with the person they are talking to or the person about which they are talking. Politeness is a critical part of Korean language and Korean culture, therefore, when talking to someone esteemed, the correct verb ending, which should have a lot of respect, must be chosen.     [ edit ]   Adjective   Words categorized as Korean  adjectives  (  ,  hyeong-yongsa ,   ) conjugate similarly to verbs, so some English texts call them ""descriptive verbs"" or "" stative verbs "", but they are distinctly separate from    ( tongsa ).   English does not have an identical grammatical category, so the English translation of Korean adjectives may misleadingly suggest that they are verbs. For example,    ( pukda ) translates literally as ""to be red"" and    ( aswipda ) often best translates as ""to lack"" or ""to want for"", but both are    ( hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""). For a larger list of Korean adjectives, see  wikt:Category:Korean adjectives .     [ edit ]   Determiner   Korean  determiners  (  ,  gwanhyeongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""determinatives"", ""adnominals"", ""pre-nouns"", ""attributives"", and ""unconjugated adjectives"". Examples include    ( kak , ""each""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean determiners .     [ edit ]   Noun   A large body of Korean  nouns  (  ,  myeongsa ,   ) stem from  Chinese characters , e.g.    (,  san , mountain),    (,  yeok , station),    (,  munhwa , culture), etc. Others are native to the Korean language, e.g.    ( nara , country),    ( nal , day). Many  Sino-Korean words  have a native Korean equivalent and vice versa, but not always. Nouns do not have  grammatical gender  and can be made  plural  by adding  to the end of the word, however in most instances the  singular  form is used even when in English it would be translated as plural. For example, while in English the sentence  ""there are three apples""  would use the plural  ""apples""  instead of the singular  ""apple"" , the Korean sentence    ( sagwa segae isssumnida ) maintains the word  ( sagwa , ""apple"") in its singular form, thus rendered in English as ""apple three(things) exist."" For a list of Korean nouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean nouns .     [ edit ]   Pronoun   Main article:  Korean pronouns   Korean  pronouns  (  ,  daemyeongsa ,   ) are highly influenced by the honorifics in the language. Pronouns change forms depending on the social status of the person or persons spoken to, e.g. the pronoun for ""I"" there is both the informal    ( na ) and the honorific/humble    ( jeo ). In general second person singular pronouns are avoided, especially when using honorific forms. For a larger list or Korean pronouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean pronouns .     [ edit ]   Adverb   Korean  adverbs  (  ,  busa ,   ) include    ( tto , ""also"") and    ( gadeuk , ""fully""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean adverbs .     [ edit ]   Particle   Korean  particles  (  ,  josa ,   ) are also known in English as "" postpositions "". Examples include    ( neun , topic marker) and    ( reul , object marker). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean particles .     [ edit ]   Interjection   Korean  interjections  (  ,  gamtansa ,   ) are also known in English as ""exclamations"". Examples include    ( ani , ""no""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean interjections .     [ edit ]   Number   Main article:  Korean numerals   Korean  numbers  or numerals (  ,  sutja ,   ) consitute two regularly used sets: a native Korean set and a  Sino-Korean  set. The Sino-Korean system is nearly entirely based on the  Chinese numerals . The distinction between the two numeral systems is very important. Everything that can be counted will use one of the two systems, but seldom both. Sino-Korean words are sometimes used to mark ordinal usage: yeol beon ( ) means ""ten times"" while sip beon (() ()) means ""number ten."" The grouping of large numbers in Korean follow the Chinese tradition of myriads (10000) rather than thousands (1000) as is common in Europe and North America.     [ edit ]   Speech levels and honorifics   Main article:  Korean honorifics   The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean, and the grammar reflects this. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject referent is reflected in  honorifics , while that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in  speech level .     [ edit ]   Honorifics   When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a younger stranger, student, employee or the like. Nowadays, there are special endings which can be used on declarative, interrogative, and imperative sentences; and both honorific or normal sentences. They are made for easier and faster use of Korean.     [ edit ]   Speech levels   There are seven verb  paradigms  or  speech levels  in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation. [ citation needed ]  Unlike  honorifics   which are used to show respect towards the referent   speech levels  are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience. The names of the 7 levels are derived from the non-honorific  imperative  form of the verb    ( hada , ""do"") in each level, plus the suffix  ('che',  hanja :   ), which means ""style.""   The highest 6 levels are generally grouped together as  jondaenmal  (), while the lowest level ( haeche , ) is called  banmal  () in Korean.     [ edit ]   Vocabulary   The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words. Like Japanese and Vietnamese, more than 50% of the vocabulary (up to 60% by some estimates), especially words that denote abstract ideas, are  Sino-Korean words , [ 7 ]  either     directly borrowed from  Written Chinese , or   coined in Japan or Korea using  Chinese characters ,     in a similar way European languages borrow from Latin and Greek. Korean has two  number systems : one native, and one borrowed from Chinese.   To a much lesser extent, words have also occasionally been borrowed from  Mongolian ,  Sanskrit , and other languages. Conversely, the Korean language itself has also contributed some loanwords to other languages, most notably the  Tsushima dialect  of Japanese.   The vast majority of loanwords other than Sino-Korean come from modern times, 90% of which are from  English . [ 8 ]  Many words have also been borrowed from  Japanese  and  Western languages  such as  German  ( areubaiteu  part-time job,  allereugi  allergy). Some Western words were borrowed indirectly via Japanese, taking a Japanese sound pattern, for example dozen >     dsu  >     daseu . Most indirect Western borrowings are now written according to current Hangulization rules for the respective Western language, as if borrowed directly. There are a few more complicated borrowings such as German(y) (see  Names for Germany ), the first part of whose  endonym   [d.lant]  the Japanese approximated using the  kanji      doitsu  that were then accepted into the Korean language by their Sino-Korean pronunciation:     dok  +     il  =  Dogil . In South Korean official use, a number of other Sino-Korean country names have been replaced with phonetically oriented Hangulizations of the countries' endonyms or English names.   North Korean vocabulary shows a tendency to prefer native Korean over Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings, especially with recent political objectives aimed at eliminating foreign (mostly Chinese) influences on the Korean language in the North. By contrast, South Korean may have several Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings which tend to be absent in North Korean.

Such systems were not popular because hanja is not well suited to the Korean language. Its use is now limited.   Korean is now mainly written in Hangul, the Korean alphabet promulgated in 1446 by  Sejong the Great ;  hanja may be mixed in  to write  Sino-Korean words . South Korea still teaches 1800 hanja characters in its schools, while the North abolished the use of hanja decades ago.

Korean  punctuation  marks are almost identical to Western ones. Traditionally, Korean was written in columns from top to bottom, right to left, but is now usually written in rows from left to right, top to bottom.     [ edit ]   Differences between North Korean and South Korean   Main article:  Korean language North-South differences   The Korean language used in the North and the South exhibits differences in pronunciation, spelling, grammar and vocabulary. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Pronunciation   In North Korea,  palatalization  of  /si/  is optional, and  //  can be pronounced as  [z]  in between vowels.   Words that are written the same way may be pronounced differently, such as the examples below. The pronunciations below are given in  Revised Romanization ,  McCune-Reischauer  and Hangul, the last of which represents what the Hangul would be if one writes the word as pronounced.

(In the South, this rule only applies when it is attached to any single-character Sino-Korean word.)     [ edit ]   Spelling   Some words are spelled differently by the North and the South, but the pronunciations are the same.

[ edit ]   Spelling and pronunciation   Some words have different spellings and pronunciations in the North and the South, some of which were given in the ""Phonology"" section above:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          ryeongryang (ryngryang)      yeongnyang (yngnyang)   strength   Korean words originally starting in  r  or  n  have their  r  or  n  dropped in the South Korean version if the sound following it is an  i  or  y  sound.          rodong (rodong)      nodong (nodong)   work   Korean words originally starting in  r  have their  r  changed to  n  in the South Korean version if the sound following it is a sound other than  i  or  y .          wonssu (wnssu)      wonsu (wnsu)   mortal enemy   ""Mortal enemy"" and ""head of state"" are homophones in the South. Possibly to avoid referring to  Kim Il-sung  /  Kim Jong-il  as the enemy, the second syllable of ""enemy"" is written and pronounced  in the North.          rajio (rajio)      radio (radio)   radio            u (u)      wi (wi)   on; above            anhae (anhae)      anae (anae)   wife            kkuba (kkuba)      kuba (k'uba)   Cuba   When transcribing foreign words from languages that do not have contrasts between aspirated and unaspirated stops, North Koreans generally use tensed stops for the unaspirated ones while South Koreans use aspirated stops in both cases.          pe (p'e)      pye (p'ye), pe (p'e)   lungs   All hanja pronounced as  pye  ( p'ye ) or  pe  ( p'e ) in the South are pronounced as  pe  ( p'e ) in the North. The spelling is also accordingly different.       In general, when transcribing place names, North Korea tends to use the pronunciation in the original language more than South Korea, which often uses the pronunciation in English. For example:       Original name   North Korea transliteration   English name   South Korea transliteration       Spelling   Pronunciation   Spelling   Pronunciaton       Ulaanbaatar      ullanbattareu (ullanbattar)   Ulan Bator      ullanbatoreu (ullanbat'or)       Kbenhavn      koeppenhabeun (k'oeppenhabn)   Copenhagen      kopenhagen (k'op'enhagen)       al-Qhirah      kkahira (kkahira)   Cairo      kairo (k'airo)         [ edit ]   Grammar   Some grammatical constructions are also different:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          doeyeotda (toeytta)      doeeotda (toetta)   past tense of  (doeda/toeda), ""to become""   All similar grammar forms of verbs or adjectives that end in  in the stem (i.e. , , , ,  and ) in the North use  instead of the South's .          gomawayo (komawayo)      gomawoyo (komawyo)   thanks   -irregular verbs in the North use  (wa) for all those with a positive ending vowel; this only happens in the South if the verb stem has only one syllable.          halgayo (halkayo)      halkkayo (halkkayo)   Shall we do?   Although the Hangul differ, the pronunciations are the same (i.e. with the tensed  sound).         [ edit ]   Vocabulary   Some vocabulary is different between the North and the South:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          munhwajutaek (munhwajut'aek)      apateu (ap'at')   Apartment     (appateu/appat') is also used in the North.          joseonmal (chosnmal)      han-gugeo(han'gugeo)   Korean language            gwakbap (kwakpap)      dosirak (tosirak)   lunch box           [ edit ]   Others   In the North,  guillemets     and    are the symbols used for quotes; in the South, quotation marks equivalent to the English ones,  and , are standard, although     and     are sometimes used in popular novels.     [ edit ]   Study by non-native speakers   The  United States '  Defense Language Institute  classifies Korean alongside  Arabic ,  Chinese , and  Japanese  as a Category IV language, meaning that 63 weeks of instruction (as compared to just 25 weeks for  French ,  Spanish ,  Portuguese , and  Italian ) are required to bring an English-speaking student to a limited working level of proficiency in which he or she has ""sufficient capability to meet routine social demands and limited job requirements"" and ""can deal with concrete topics in past, present, and future tense."" [ 10 ]  As a result, the study of the Korean language in the United States is dominated by  Korean American  heritage language students; they are estimated to form over 80% of all students of the language at non-military universities. [ 11 ]   However, Korean is considerably easier for speakers of certain other languages, such as Japanese, Mongolian and Turkic languages; in Japan, it is more widely studied by non-heritage learners. [ 12 ]  The  Korean Language Proficiency Test , an examination aimed at assessing non-native speakers' competence in Korean, was instituted in 1997; 17,000 people applied for the 2005 sitting of the examination.

Until the early 1400s, most documents were written in classical Chinese characters (known in Korean as  Hanja ). As the idiographs are difficult to learn, only the educated people could read and write. King Sejong, the 4th ruler of the  Joseon dynasty  (1392-1910), set up a special committee of scholars in 1443 to create a new writing system specifically suited to the Korean language.    The result was  Hangul  (meaning 'the one script'). It originally contained 28 symbols, although 4 have dropped out of use. The  alphabet  has 10 vowels and 14 consonants. The consonants represent the simplified outlines of the parts of the mouth and tongue used to pronounce them. The vowels are associated with elements of the philosophy of the  Book of Changes .    In 1994, Discovery magazine described  Hangul  as the most logical language writing system in the world. The simplicity of  Hangul  led Korea to become one of the most literate countries in the world. U.S. novelist Pearl Buck said that  Hangul  is the simplest writing system in the world and likened  King  Sejong  to Leonardo da Vinci. Even though  Hangul  is a system of phonetic symbols, it is categorized as new level of feature system, the first and the only in the world. On Oct. 1, 1997, UNESCO designated  Hunminjeongeum  as world archive property. Koreans commemorate the creation of  Hangul  each year on October 9.       The  Hangul  Characters                Before you begin learning the language, you should take some time to practice  writing   Hangul .    The symbols are combined into blocks, each one representing a single syllable. Each syllable must start with a consonant, although the  iung  is silent in the initial position. Text is arranged either in the traditional vertical fashion, with columns reading from right to left (as in some newspapers and old books) or in rows reading left to right (as in most modern novels and magazines). The alphabet may appear complicated, but it is actually easy to learn. Once you are familiar with the characters, looking up words in a dictionary becomes easy.    When speaking Korean, you use formal or informal words and phrases, depending on the status of the person to whom you are talking.  For example, you generally use informal speech to children and formal speech to older people.  It is better to err by being too formal rather than showing disrespect.  However, Koreans do not expect foreigners to be fluent and will usually excuse minor mistakes.    To aid the traveler and expatriate,  Life in Korea  has created several pages of useful  phrases and vocabulary . To truly learn the Korean language, you should enroll in any of the numerous courses offered by Korean universities and private organizations.

It was  used widely during the Chinese occupation of northern Korea from 108  BC to 313 AD. By the 5th century AD, the Koreans were starting to write  in Classical Chinese - the earliest known example of this dates from  414 AD. They later devised three different systems for writing Korean  with Chinese characters:  Hyangchal  (향찰/鄕札),   Gukyeol  (구결/口訣) and  Idu   (이두/吏讀). These systems were similar to those  developed in Japan and were probably used as models by the Japanese.    The  Idu  system used a combination of Chinese characters together  with special symbols to indicate Korean verb endings and other grammatical  markers, and was used to in official and private documents for many centuries.  The  Hyangchal  system used Chinese characters to represent all the  sounds of Korean and was used mainly to write poetry.    The Koreans borrowed a huge number of Chinese words, gave Korean readings  and/or meanings to some of the Chinese characters and also invented  about 150 new characters, most of which are rare or used mainly for  personal or place names.    The Korean alphabet was invented in 1444 and promulgated it in 1446  during the reign of King Sejong (r.1418-1450), the fourth king of the  Joseon Dynasty. The alphabet was originally called  Hunmin jeongeum ,  or ""The correct sounds for the instruction of the people"",  but has also been known as  Eonmeun  (vulgar script) and  Gukmeun   (national writing). The modern name for the alphabet,  Hangeul ,  was coined by a Korean linguist called Ju Si-gyeong (1876-1914). In   North Korea the alphabet is known as 조선글 (josoen guel).    The shapes of the consonants are based on the shape the mouth made when  the corresponding sound is made, and  the traditional direction of writing  (vertically from right to left) most likely came from Chinese, as did the  practice of writing syllables in blocks.    Even after the invention of the Korean alphabet, most Koreans who could  write continued to write either in Classical Chinese or in Korean using  the  Gukyeol  or  Idu  systems. The Korean alphabet was associated  with people of low status, i.e. women, children and the uneducated.  During the 19th and 20th centuries a mixed writing system combining  Chinese characters ( Hanja ) and  Hangeul  became increasingly  popular. Since 1945 however, the importance of Chinese characters in  Korean writing has diminished significantly.    Since 1949  hanja  have not been used at all in any North Korean  publications, with the exception of a few textbooks and specialized books.  In the late 1960s the teaching of  hanja  was reintroduced in North  Korean schools however and school children are expected to learn 2,000  characters by the end of high school.    In South Korea school children are expected to learn 1,800  hanja   by the end of high school. The proportion of  hanja   used in Korean texts varies greatly from writer to writer and there  is considerable public debate about the role of  hanja  in Korean  writing.    Most modern Korean literature and informal writing is written entirely in   hangeul , however academic papers and official documents tend to be  written in a mixture of  hangeul  and  hanja .    Notable features of Hangeul      There are 24 letters ( jamo ) in the Korean alphabet: 14 consonants  and 10 vowels. The letters are combined together into syllable blocks.            The shapes of the the consontants g/k, n, s, m and ng are graphical  representations of the speech organs used to pronounce them. Other consonsants  were created by adding extra lines to the basic shapes.      The shapes of the the vowels are based on three elements: man (a vertical  line), earth (a horizontal line) and heaven (a dot). In modern Hangeul  the heavenly dot has mutated into a short line.      Spaces are placed between words, which can be made up of one or  more syllables.      The sounds of some consonants change depending on whether they appear  at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of a syllable.      A number of Korean scholars have proposed an alternative method  of writing  Hangeul  involving writing each letter in a line like in English,  rather than grouping them into syllable blocks, but their efforts have been  met with little interest or enthusiasm.      In South Korea  hanja  are used to some extent in Korean texts.      Korean can be written in vertical columns running from top to bottom  and right to left, or in horizontal lines running from left to right.       Used to write   Korean  (한국어 / 조선말),   a language spoken by about 63 million people in South Korea, North Korea, China, Japan,   Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Russia. The relationship between Korean and other languages   is not known for sure, though some linguists believe it to be a member of the Altaic   family of languages. Grammatically Korean is very similar to Japanese and about 70% of its  vocabulary comes from Chinese.    The Hangeul alphabet (한글)       The double consonants marked with * are pronounced fortis. There is no  symbol in IPA to indiciate this.        Note on the transliteration of Korean   There are a number different ways to write Korean in the Latin alphabet.  The methods shown above are:      (first row) the official South Korean transliteration system, which  was introduced in July 2000. You can find  further details at  www.mct.go.kr .      (second row) the McCune-Reischauer system, which was devised in 1937 by two  American graduate students, George McCune and Edwin Reischauer, and is widely used  in Western publications.

Korean  (  /  , see  below ) is the official  language  of  North Korea  and  South Korea . It is also one of the two official languages in the  Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture  in  China . There are about 78 million Korean speakers. It was formerly written using  Hanja , borrowed  Chinese characters  pronounced in the Korean way. In the 15th century a national writing system was developed by  Sejong the Great , nowadays called  Hangul .   The genealogical  classification  of the Korean language is debated.

In South Korea, the language is most often called  Hangungmal  (  ;   ), or more formally,  Hangugeo  (  ;   ) or  Gugeo  (  ;   ; literally ""national language"").   In North Korea and Yanbian in China, the language is most often called  Chosnmal  (  ; with  hanja :   ), or more formally,  Chosn  (  ;   ).   On the other hand, Korean people in the  former USSR , who refer to themselves as  Koryo-saram  (also  Goryeoin  [  ;   ; literally, "" Goryeo  person(s)""]) call the language  Goryeomal  (  ;   ).   In  mainland China , following the establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992, the term  Choxiny  (   or short form:  Choy  (  )) has normally been used to refer to the language spoken in North Korea and Yanbian, while  Hnguy  (   or short form:  Hny  (  )) is used to refer to the language spoken in South Korea.   Some older English sources also used the name ""Korean"" to refer to the language, country, and people.     [ edit ]   History   Main article:  History of the Korean language   Korean is descended from  Old Korean  and  Middle Korean .     [ edit ]   Classification   The classification of the modern Korean language is uncertain, and due to the lack of any one generally accepted theory, it is sometimes described conservatively as a  language isolate .   On the other hand, since the publication of the article of  Ramstedt  in 1926, many linguists support the hypothesis that Korean can be classified as an  Altaic  language, or as a relative of proto-Altaic. Korean is similar to Altaic languages in that they both lack certain grammatical elements, including  number ,  gender ,  articles , fusional morphology, voice, and  relative pronouns  (Kim Namkil). Korean especially bears some  morphological  resemblance to some languages of the Northern Turkic group, namely  Sakha (Yakut) . Vinokurova, a scholar of the Sakha language, noted that like in Korean, and unlike in other  Turkic languages  or a variety of other languages surveyed, adverbs in Sakha are derived from verbs with the help of derivational morphology; however, she did not suggest this implied any relation between the two languages. [ 2 ]   It is also considered likely that Korean is related in some way to  Japanese , since the two languages have nearly identical grammatical structures, and share a number of possible phonological cognates (though a majority of them are likely due to local pronunciations of the Chinese characters from which they are derived), as noted by such researchers as  Samuel E. Martin  and  Roy Andrew Miller  in the late 1960s.  Sergei Starostin  (1991) found about 25% of potential cognates in the Japanese-Korean 100-word  Swadesh list , which places these two languages closer together than other possible members of the Altaic family. [ 3 ]   Genetic relationships have been postulated both directly and indirectly, the latter either through placing both languages in the Altaic family, or by arguing for a relationship between Japanese and the  Buyeo languages  of  Goguryeo  and  Baekje  (see below); the proposed Baekje relationship is supported by cognates such as Baekje  mir , Japanese  mi-  ""three"". [ 4 ]   The possible relationship between Korean and Japanese can be exemplified by such basic vocabularly items as J.     mizu  (Old J.  midu ) : K.     mul  (Middle K.  mirh ) ""water"",  mot  ""lake""; J.     ku-ru  ""come"" (Old J.  ku , also cf. irregular root changes as in past tense   ki-ta , negative   ko-nai  in Modern J.) : K.     ka-da  (""go""); J.     kata-i  ""hard"" (whence     kata-na  ""knife, sword"") : K.  kud-yn  (hard); J.     i-ru  ""to be"" (past tense   i-ta ) : K.     i-da  ""to be""; J.  na ,  -en  : K.  anh  ""not"", J.  minna  (Old J.  mynna ) ""all, everyone"" : K.  manh-  ""many"" (predicate  mana-da ), etc.  [ 5 ] . The same possible cognates are often observed in other members of the potential  Altaic family , esp. in the  Tungusic languages . Cf. Nanay  mue  ""water"",  giagda-  ""to walk"",  anaa, anna  ""not"".   Others argue, however, that the similarities are not due to any genetic relationship, but rather to a  sprachbund  effect. [ citation needed ]  See  East Asian languages  for morphological features shared among languages of the East Asian  sprachbund , and  Classification of Japanese  for further details on the possible relationship. Though it is very difficult to believe words such as ""water"", ""to be"", and ""to go"" arise from sprachbund effects.   It is presumed that modern Korean may be more closely related to the languages of  Samhan  and  Silla  than the Buyeo languages; many Korean scholars believe they were mutually intelligible, and the collective basis of what in the  Goryeo  period would merge to become Middle Korean (the language before the changes that the  Seven-Year War  brought) and eventually Modern Korean. The  Jeju dialect  preserves some archaic features that can also be found in Middle Korean, whose  arae a  is retained in the dialect as a distinct vowel.   There are also more marginal hypotheses proposing various other relationships; for example, a few scholars, such as  Homer B. Hulbert  (1905), have tried to relate Korean to the  Dravidian languages  through the similar syntax in both. [ 6 ]   Though not related to Chinese, it has borrowed heavily; see the Vocabulary section below.     [ edit ]   Dialects   Main article:  Korean dialects          Dialects of Korean       Korean has several  dialects  (called  mal  [literally ""speech""],  saturi , or  bang-eon  in Korean). The  standard language  ( pyojuneo  or  pyojunmal ) of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  P'yngyang . All dialects of Korean are similar to each other, and are in fact all mutually intelligible, perhaps with the exception of the dialect of  Jeju Island  (see  Jeju dialect ). The dialect spoken in Jeju is in fact classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of  Seoul dialect  use very little stress, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of the  Gyeongsang dialect  have a very pronounced intonation.   It is also worth noting that there is substantial evidence for a history of extensive  dialect levelling , or even  convergent evolution  or intermixture of two or more originally distinct linguistic stocks, within the Korean language and its dialects. Many Korean dialects have basic vocabulary that is etymologically distinct from vocabulary of identical meaning in Standard Korean or other dialects, such as South Jeolla dialect /kur/ vs. Standard Korean     /ip/  ""mouth"" or Gyeongsang dialect  /.u.i/  vs. Standard Korean  /puu/  "" garlic chives ."" This suggests that the Korean Peninsula may have at one time been much more linguistically diverse than it is at present. See also the  Buyeo languages   hypothesis .   There is a very close connection between the dialects of Korean and the  regions of Korea , since the boundaries of both are largely determined by mountains and seas.

Main article:  Korean phonology     [ edit ]   Consonants          The Korean consonants             Bilabial   Alveolar   Post-  alveolar   Velar   Glottal       Nasal      /m/      /n/        //  (syllable-final)         Plosive  and   Affricate   plain      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         tense      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         aspirated      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         Fricative   plain        /s/          /h/       tense        /s/             Liquid        /l/           The  IPA  symbol <  > (a subscript double straight quotation mark, shown here with a placeholder circle) is used to denote the tensed consonants  /p/, /t/, /k/, //, /s/ . Its official use in the  Extensions to the IPA  is for  'strong'  articulation, but is used in the literature for  faucalized voice . The Korean consonants also have elements of  stiff voice , but it is not yet known how typical this is of faucalized consonants. They are produced with a partially constricted  glottis  and additional subglottal pressure in addition to tense vocal tract walls, laryngeal lowering, or other expansion of the larynx.     [ edit ]   Vowels                    The Korean basic vowels                 Monophthongs   /i/    ,  /e/    ,  //    ,  /a/    ,  /o/    ,  /u/    ,  //    ,  //    ,  //          Vowels preceded by intermediaries,  or Diphthongs   /je/    ,  /j/    ,  /ja/    ,  /wi/    ,  /we/    ,  /w/    ,  /wa/    ,  /i/    ,  /jo/    ,  /ju/    ,  /j/    ,  /w/            [ edit ]   Allophones   /s/  becomes an  alveolo-palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i]  for most speakers (but see  Differences in the language between North Korea and South Korea ). This occurs with the tense fricative and all the affricates as well. At the end of a syllable, /s/ changes to /t/ (Example: beoseot () 'mushroom').   /h/  may become a  bilabial   []  before  [o]  or  [u] , a  palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i] , a  velar   [x]  before  [] , a voiced  []  between voiced sounds, and a  [h]  elsewhere. [ citation needed ]   /p, t, , k/  become voiced  [b, d, , ]  between voiced sounds.   /l/  becomes alveolar flap  []  between vowels, and  [l]  or  []  at the end of a syllable or next to another  /l/ . Note that a written syllable-final '', when followed by a vowel or a glide ( i.e. , when the next character starts with ''), migrates to the next syllable and thus becomes  [] .   Traditionally,  /l/  was disallowed at the beginning of a word. It disappeared before  [j] , and otherwise became  /n/ . However, the inflow of western loanword changed the trend, and now word-initial  /l/  (mostly from English loanwords) are pronounced as a free variation of either  []  or  [l] . The traditional prohibition of word-initial  /l/  became a morphological rule called ""initial law"" () in South Korea, which pertains to Sino-Korean vocabulary. Such words retain their word-initial  /l/  in North Korea.   All  obstruents  (plosives, affricates, fricatives) are  unreleased   [p, t, k]  at the end of a word.   Plosive stops  /p, t, k/  become nasal stops  [m, n, ]  before nasal stops.   Hangul  spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying, partly historical  morphology . Given this, it is sometimes hard to tell which actual phonemes are present in a certain word.   One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial  [r] , and initial  [n] . For example,     ""labour"" - north:  r odong  (), south:  n odong  ()   ""history"" - north:  ry ksa  (), south:  y eoksa  ()   ""female"" - north:  ny ja  (), south:  y eoja  ()       [ edit ]   Morphophonemics   Grammatical morphemes may change shape depending on the preceding sounds. Examples include  -eun/-neun  (-/-) and  -i/-ga  (-/-). Sometimes sounds may be inserted instead. Examples include  -eul/-reul  (-/-),  -euro/-ro  (-/-),  -eseo/-seo  (-/-),  -ideunji/-deunji  (-/-) and  -iya/-ya  (-/-). However,  -euro/-ro  is somewhat irregular, since it will behave differently after a rieul consonant.     Korean particles     After a consonant   After a rieul   After a vowel       -ui  (-)       -eun  (-)   -neun  (-)       -i  (-)   -ga  (-)       -eul  (-)   -reul  (-)       -gwa  (-)   -wa  (-)       -euro  (-)   -ro  (-)       Some verbs may also change shape morphophonemically.     [ edit ]   Grammar   Main article:  Korean grammar     [ edit ]   Sentence structure   Korean is an  agglutinative language . Modifiers generally follow the modified word, and in the case of verb modifiers, can be serially appended. The basic form of a Korean sentence is  Subject Object Verb , but the verb is the only required and immovable element.       A :       -       -? (?)           kage-e     kasseo-yo           store + [location marker ()]     [go (verb root) ()]+[conjunctive ()]+[past ()]+[conjunctive ()]+ [polite marker ()]         ""Did [you] go to the store?"" (with ""you"" implied by context)         B :       .           ye           yes         ""Yes.""       [ edit ]   Parts of speech     [ edit ]   Verb   Korean  verbs  (  ,  tongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""action verbs"" or ""dynamic verbs"" to distinguish them from [  () ,  hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""]), which are also known as ""descriptive verbs"" or ""stative verbs"". Examples of action/dynamic verbs include    ( hada , ""to do"") and    ( kada , ""to go"") which constitute an action or movement as opposed to descriptive verbs such as    ( yehppeuda , ""to be beautiful""). For a larger list of Korean verbs, see  wikt:Category:Korean verbs .   Unlike most of the European languages, Korean does not conjugate verbs using agreement with the subject, and nouns have no gender. Instead, verb conjugations depend upon the verb tense, aspect, mood, and the social relation between the speaker, the subjects, and the listeners. The system of speech levels and honorifics loosely resembles the  T-V distinction  of most  Indo-European languages . For example, different endings are used based on the speaker's relation with the person they are talking to or the person about which they are talking. Politeness is a critical part of Korean language and Korean culture, therefore, when talking to someone esteemed, the correct verb ending, which should have a lot of respect, must be chosen.     [ edit ]   Adjective   Words categorized as Korean  adjectives  (  ,  hyeong-yongsa ,   ) conjugate similarly to verbs, so some English texts call them ""descriptive verbs"" or "" stative verbs "", but they are distinctly separate from    ( tongsa ).   English does not have an identical grammatical category, so the English translation of Korean adjectives may misleadingly suggest that they are verbs. For example,    ( pukda ) translates literally as ""to be red"" and    ( aswipda ) often best translates as ""to lack"" or ""to want for"", but both are    ( hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""). For a larger list of Korean adjectives, see  wikt:Category:Korean adjectives .     [ edit ]   Determiner   Korean  determiners  (  ,  gwanhyeongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""determinatives"", ""adnominals"", ""pre-nouns"", ""attributives"", and ""unconjugated adjectives"". Examples include    ( kak , ""each""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean determiners .     [ edit ]   Noun   A large body of Korean  nouns  (  ,  myeongsa ,   ) stem from  Chinese characters , e.g.    (,  san , mountain),    (,  yeok , station),    (,  munhwa , culture), etc. Others are native to the Korean language, e.g.    ( nara , country),    ( nal , day). Many  Sino-Korean words  have a native Korean equivalent and vice versa, but not always. Nouns do not have  grammatical gender  and can be made  plural  by adding  to the end of the word, however in most instances the  singular  form is used even when in English it would be translated as plural. For example, while in English the sentence  ""there are three apples""  would use the plural  ""apples""  instead of the singular  ""apple"" , the Korean sentence    ( sagwa segae isssumnida ) maintains the word  ( sagwa , ""apple"") in its singular form, thus rendered in English as ""apple three(things) exist."" For a list of Korean nouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean nouns .     [ edit ]   Pronoun   Main article:  Korean pronouns   Korean  pronouns  (  ,  daemyeongsa ,   ) are highly influenced by the honorifics in the language. Pronouns change forms depending on the social status of the person or persons spoken to, e.g. the pronoun for ""I"" there is both the informal    ( na ) and the honorific/humble    ( jeo ). In general second person singular pronouns are avoided, especially when using honorific forms. For a larger list or Korean pronouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean pronouns .     [ edit ]   Adverb   Korean  adverbs  (  ,  busa ,   ) include    ( tto , ""also"") and    ( gadeuk , ""fully""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean adverbs .     [ edit ]   Particle   Korean  particles  (  ,  josa ,   ) are also known in English as "" postpositions "". Examples include    ( neun , topic marker) and    ( reul , object marker). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean particles .     [ edit ]   Interjection   Korean  interjections  (  ,  gamtansa ,   ) are also known in English as ""exclamations"". Examples include    ( ani , ""no""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean interjections .     [ edit ]   Number   Main article:  Korean numerals   Korean  numbers  or numerals (  ,  sutja ,   ) consitute two regularly used sets: a native Korean set and a  Sino-Korean  set. The Sino-Korean system is nearly entirely based on the  Chinese numerals . The distinction between the two numeral systems is very important. Everything that can be counted will use one of the two systems, but seldom both. Sino-Korean words are sometimes used to mark ordinal usage: yeol beon ( ) means ""ten times"" while sip beon (() ()) means ""number ten."" The grouping of large numbers in Korean follow the Chinese tradition of myriads (10000) rather than thousands (1000) as is common in Europe and North America.     [ edit ]   Speech levels and honorifics   Main article:  Korean honorifics   The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean, and the grammar reflects this. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject referent is reflected in  honorifics , while that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in  speech level .     [ edit ]   Honorifics   When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a younger stranger, student, employee or the like. Nowadays, there are special endings which can be used on declarative, interrogative, and imperative sentences; and both honorific or normal sentences. They are made for easier and faster use of Korean.     [ edit ]   Speech levels   There are seven verb  paradigms  or  speech levels  in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation. [ citation needed ]  Unlike  honorifics   which are used to show respect towards the referent   speech levels  are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience. The names of the 7 levels are derived from the non-honorific  imperative  form of the verb    ( hada , ""do"") in each level, plus the suffix  ('che',  hanja :   ), which means ""style.""   The highest 6 levels are generally grouped together as  jondaenmal  (), while the lowest level ( haeche , ) is called  banmal  () in Korean.     [ edit ]   Vocabulary   The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words. Like Japanese and Vietnamese, more than 50% of the vocabulary (up to 60% by some estimates), especially words that denote abstract ideas, are  Sino-Korean words , [ 7 ]  either     directly borrowed from  Written Chinese , or   coined in Japan or Korea using  Chinese characters ,     in a similar way European languages borrow from Latin and Greek. Korean has two  number systems : one native, and one borrowed from Chinese.   To a much lesser extent, words have also occasionally been borrowed from  Mongolian ,  Sanskrit , and other languages. Conversely, the Korean language itself has also contributed some loanwords to other languages, most notably the  Tsushima dialect  of Japanese.   The vast majority of loanwords other than Sino-Korean come from modern times, 90% of which are from  English . [ 8 ]  Many words have also been borrowed from  Japanese  and  Western languages  such as  German  ( areubaiteu  part-time job,  allereugi  allergy). Some Western words were borrowed indirectly via Japanese, taking a Japanese sound pattern, for example dozen >     dsu  >     daseu . Most indirect Western borrowings are now written according to current Hangulization rules for the respective Western language, as if borrowed directly. There are a few more complicated borrowings such as German(y) (see  Names for Germany ), the first part of whose  endonym   [d.lant]  the Japanese approximated using the  kanji      doitsu  that were then accepted into the Korean language by their Sino-Korean pronunciation:     dok  +     il  =  Dogil . In South Korean official use, a number of other Sino-Korean country names have been replaced with phonetically oriented Hangulizations of the countries' endonyms or English names.   North Korean vocabulary shows a tendency to prefer native Korean over Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings, especially with recent political objectives aimed at eliminating foreign (mostly Chinese) influences on the Korean language in the North. By contrast, South Korean may have several Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings which tend to be absent in North Korean.     [ edit ]   Writing system       Korean writing systems           Hangul       Hanja       Hyangchal   Gugyeol   Idu       Mixed script       Korean romanization       Revised Romanization of Korean   McCune-Reischauer   Yale Romanization           Main article:  Hangul   See also:  Hangul consonant and vowel tables   In ancient times, the languages of the Korean peninsula were written using  Chinese characters , using  hyangchal  or  idu . Such systems were not popular because hanja is not well suited to the Korean language. Its use is now limited.   Korean is now mainly written in Hangul, the Korean alphabet promulgated in 1446 by  Sejong the Great ;  hanja may be mixed in  to write  Sino-Korean words . South Korea still teaches 1800 hanja characters in its schools, while the North abolished the use of hanja decades ago.   Below is a chart of the Korean alphabet's symbols and their canonical  IPA  values:     Consonants     Hangul                                                                        RR   b , p   d , t   j   g , k   pp   tt   jj   kk   p   t   ch   k   s   h   ss   m   n   ng       r , l           IPA   p   t      k   p   t      k   p   t      k   s   h   s   m   n      w   r   j         Vowels     Hangul                                                                      RR   i   e   oe   ae   a   o   u   eo   eu   ui   ye   yae   ya   yo   yu   yeo   wi   we   wae   wa   wo       IPA   i   e         a   o   u         i   je   j   ja   jo   ju   j   wi   we   w   wa   w       Modern Korean is written with  spaces  between  words , a feature not found in Chinese or Japanese. Korean  punctuation  marks are almost identical to Western ones. Traditionally, Korean was written in columns from top to bottom, right to left, but is now usually written in rows from left to right, top to bottom.     [ edit ]   Differences between North Korean and South Korean   Main article:  Korean language North-South differences   The Korean language used in the North and the South exhibits differences in pronunciation, spelling, grammar and vocabulary. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Pronunciation   In North Korea,  palatalization  of  /si/  is optional, and  //  can be pronounced as  [z]  in between vowels.   Words that are written the same way may be pronounced differently, such as the examples below. The pronunciations below are given in  Revised Romanization ,  McCune-Reischauer  and Hangul, the last of which represents what the Hangul would be if one writes the word as pronounced.

(In the South, this rule only applies when it is attached to any single-character Sino-Korean word.)     [ edit ]   Spelling   Some words are spelled differently by the North and the South, but the pronunciations are the same.

[ edit ]   Spelling and pronunciation   Some words have different spellings and pronunciations in the North and the South, some of which were given in the ""Phonology"" section above:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          ryeongryang (ryngryang)      yeongnyang (yngnyang)   strength   Korean words originally starting in  r  or  n  have their  r  or  n  dropped in the South Korean version if the sound following it is an  i  or  y  sound.          rodong (rodong)      nodong (nodong)   work   Korean words originally starting in  r  have their  r  changed to  n  in the South Korean version if the sound following it is a sound other than  i  or  y .          wonssu (wnssu)      wonsu (wnsu)   mortal enemy   ""Mortal enemy"" and ""head of state"" are homophones in the South. Possibly to avoid referring to  Kim Il-sung  /  Kim Jong-il  as the enemy, the second syllable of ""enemy"" is written and pronounced  in the North.          rajio (rajio)      radio (radio)   radio            u (u)      wi (wi)   on; above            anhae (anhae)      anae (anae)   wife            kkuba (kkuba)      kuba (k'uba)   Cuba   When transcribing foreign words from languages that do not have contrasts between aspirated and unaspirated stops, North Koreans generally use tensed stops for the unaspirated ones while South Koreans use aspirated stops in both cases.          pe (p'e)      pye (p'ye), pe (p'e)   lungs   All hanja pronounced as  pye  ( p'ye ) or  pe  ( p'e ) in the South are pronounced as  pe  ( p'e ) in the North. The spelling is also accordingly different.       In general, when transcribing place names, North Korea tends to use the pronunciation in the original language more than South Korea, which often uses the pronunciation in English.

Although the Hangul differ, the pronunciations are the same (i.e. with the tensed  sound).

[ edit ]   Study by non-native speakers   The  United States '  Defense Language Institute  classifies Korean alongside  Arabic ,  Chinese , and  Japanese  as a Category IV language, meaning that 63 weeks of instruction (as compared to just 25 weeks for  French ,  Spanish ,  Portuguese , and  Italian ) are required to bring an English-speaking student to a limited working level of proficiency in which he or she has ""sufficient capability to meet routine social demands and limited job requirements"" and ""can deal with concrete topics in past, present, and future tense."" [ 10 ]  As a result, the study of the Korean language in the United States is dominated by  Korean American  heritage language students; they are estimated to form over 80% of all students of the language at non-military universities. [ 11 ]   However, Korean is considerably easier for speakers of certain other languages, such as Japanese, Mongolian and Turkic languages; in Japan, it is more widely studied by non-heritage learners. [ 12 ]  The  Korean Language Proficiency Test , an examination aimed at assessing non-native speakers' competence in Korean, was instituted in 1997; 17,000 people applied for the 2005 sitting of the examination.

Korean  (  /  , see  below ) is the official  language  of  North Korea  and  South Korea . It is also one of the two official languages in the  Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture  in  China . There are about 78 million Korean speakers. It was formerly written using  Hanja , borrowed  Chinese characters  pronounced in the Korean way. In the 15th century a national writing system was developed by  Sejong the Great , nowadays called  Hangul .   The genealogical  classification  of the Korean language is debated. Some linguists place it in the  Altaic  language family, while others consider it to be a  language isolate . It is  agglutinative  in its morphology and  SOV  in its  syntax .

In South Korea, the language is most often called  Hangungmal  (  ;   ), or more formally,  Hangugeo  (  ;   ) or  Gugeo  (  ;   ; literally ""national language"").   In North Korea and Yanbian in China, the language is most often called  Chosnmal  (  ; with  hanja :   ), or more formally,  Chosn  (  ;   ).   On the other hand, Korean people in the  former USSR , who refer to themselves as  Koryo-saram  (also  Goryeoin  [  ;   ; literally, "" Goryeo  person(s)""]) call the language  Goryeomal  (  ;   ).   In  mainland China , following the establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992, the term  Choxiny  (   or short form:  Choy  (  )) has normally been used to refer to the language spoken in North Korea and Yanbian, while  Hnguy  (   or short form:  Hny  (  )) is used to refer to the language spoken in South Korea.   Some older English sources also used the name ""Korean"" to refer to the language, country, and people.     [ edit ]   History   Main article:  History of the Korean language   Korean is descended from  Old Korean  and  Middle Korean .     [ edit ]   Classification   The classification of the modern Korean language is uncertain, and due to the lack of any one generally accepted theory, it is sometimes described conservatively as a  language isolate .   On the other hand, since the publication of the article of  Ramstedt  in 1926, many linguists support the hypothesis that Korean can be classified as an  Altaic  language, or as a relative of proto-Altaic. Korean is similar to Altaic languages in that they both lack certain grammatical elements, including  number ,  gender ,  articles , fusional morphology, voice, and  relative pronouns  (Kim Namkil). Korean especially bears some  morphological  resemblance to some languages of the Northern Turkic group, namely  Sakha (Yakut) . Vinokurova, a scholar of the Sakha language, noted that like in Korean, and unlike in other  Turkic languages  or a variety of other languages surveyed, adverbs in Sakha are derived from verbs with the help of derivational morphology; however, she did not suggest this implied any relation between the two languages. [ 2 ]   It is also considered likely that Korean is related in some way to  Japanese , since the two languages have nearly identical grammatical structures, and share a number of possible phonological cognates (though a majority of them are likely due to local pronunciations of the Chinese characters from which they are derived), as noted by such researchers as  Samuel E. Martin  and  Roy Andrew Miller  in the late 1960s.  Sergei Starostin  (1991) found about 25% of potential cognates in the Japanese-Korean 100-word  Swadesh list , which places these two languages closer together than other possible members of the Altaic family. [ 3 ]   Genetic relationships have been postulated both directly and indirectly, the latter either through placing both languages in the Altaic family, or by arguing for a relationship between Japanese and the  Buyeo languages  of  Goguryeo  and  Baekje  (see below); the proposed Baekje relationship is supported by cognates such as Baekje  mir , Japanese  mi-  ""three"". [ 4 ]   The possible relationship between Korean and Japanese can be exemplified by such basic vocabularly items as J.     mizu  (Old J.  midu ) : K.     mul  (Middle K.  mirh ) ""water"",  mot  ""lake""; J.     ku-ru  ""come"" (Old J.  ku , also cf. irregular root changes as in past tense   ki-ta , negative   ko-nai  in Modern J.) : K.     ka-da  (""go""); J.     kata-i  ""hard"" (whence     kata-na  ""knife, sword"") : K.  kud-yn  (hard); J.     i-ru  ""to be"" (past tense   i-ta ) : K.     i-da  ""to be""; J.  na ,  -en  : K.  anh  ""not"", J.  minna  (Old J.  mynna ) ""all, everyone"" : K.  manh-  ""many"" (predicate  mana-da ), etc.  [ 5 ] . The same possible cognates are often observed in other members of the potential  Altaic family , esp. in the  Tungusic languages . Cf. Nanay  mue  ""water"",  giagda-  ""to walk"",  anaa, anna  ""not"".   Others argue, however, that the similarities are not due to any genetic relationship, but rather to a  sprachbund  effect. [ citation needed ]  See  East Asian languages  for morphological features shared among languages of the East Asian  sprachbund , and  Classification of Japanese  for further details on the possible relationship. Though it is very difficult to believe words such as ""water"", ""to be"", and ""to go"" arise from sprachbund effects.   It is presumed that modern Korean may be more closely related to the languages of  Samhan  and  Silla  than the Buyeo languages; many Korean scholars believe they were mutually intelligible, and the collective basis of what in the  Goryeo  period would merge to become Middle Korean (the language before the changes that the  Seven-Year War  brought) and eventually Modern Korean. The  Jeju dialect  preserves some archaic features that can also be found in Middle Korean, whose  arae a  is retained in the dialect as a distinct vowel.   There are also more marginal hypotheses proposing various other relationships; for example, a few scholars, such as  Homer B. Hulbert  (1905), have tried to relate Korean to the  Dravidian languages  through the similar syntax in both. [ 6 ]   Though not related to Chinese, it has borrowed heavily; see the Vocabulary section below.     [ edit ]   Dialects   Main article:  Korean dialects          Dialects of Korean       Korean has several  dialects  (called  mal  [literally ""speech""],  saturi , or  bang-eon  in Korean). The  standard language  ( pyojuneo  or  pyojunmal ) of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  P'yngyang . All dialects of Korean are similar to each other, and are in fact all mutually intelligible, perhaps with the exception of the dialect of  Jeju Island  (see  Jeju dialect ). The dialect spoken in Jeju is in fact classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of  Seoul dialect  use very little stress, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of the  Gyeongsang dialect  have a very pronounced intonation.   It is also worth noting that there is substantial evidence for a history of extensive  dialect levelling , or even  convergent evolution  or intermixture of two or more originally distinct linguistic stocks, within the Korean language and its dialects. Many Korean dialects have basic vocabulary that is etymologically distinct from vocabulary of identical meaning in Standard Korean or other dialects, such as South Jeolla dialect /kur/ vs. Standard Korean     /ip/  ""mouth"" or Gyeongsang dialect  /.u.i/  vs. Standard Korean  /puu/  "" garlic chives ."" This suggests that the Korean Peninsula may have at one time been much more linguistically diverse than it is at present. See also the  Buyeo languages   hypothesis .   There is a very close connection between the dialects of Korean and the  regions of Korea , since the boundaries of both are largely determined by mountains and seas. Here is a list of traditional dialect names and locations:       Standard dialect   Where used       Seoul   Seoul  (),  Incheon  (/), most of  Gyeonggi  (/)       P'yngan  (/)   P'yngyang ,  P'yngan  region,  Chagang  (North Korea)       Regional dialect   Where used       Gyeonggi   limited areas of the  Gyeonggi  region (South Korea)       Chungcheong   Daejeon ,  Chungcheong  region (South Korea)       Gangwon   Gangwon-do (South Korea) / Kangwn (North Korea)       Gyeongsang   Busan ,  Daegu ,  Ulsan ,  Gyeongsang  region (South Korea)       Hamgyng   Rasn ,  Hamgyng  region,  Ryanggang  (North Korea)       Hwanghae   Hwanghae  region (North Korea)       Jeju   Jeju Island/Province  (South Korea)       Jeolla   Gwangju ,  Jeolla  region (South Korea)         [ edit ]   Phonology       This article contains  IPA  phonetic symbols.

Its official use in the  Extensions to the IPA  is for  'strong'  articulation, but is used in the literature for  faucalized voice . The Korean consonants also have elements of  stiff voice , but it is not yet known how typical this is of faucalized consonants. They are produced with a partially constricted  glottis  and additional subglottal pressure in addition to tense vocal tract walls, laryngeal lowering, or other expansion of the larynx.     [ edit ]   Vowels                    The Korean basic vowels                 Monophthongs   /i/    ,  /e/    ,  //    ,  /a/    ,  /o/    ,  /u/    ,  //    ,  //    ,  //          Vowels preceded by intermediaries,  or Diphthongs   /je/    ,  /j/    ,  /ja/    ,  /wi/    ,  /we/    ,  /w/    ,  /wa/    ,  /i/    ,  /jo/    ,  /ju/    ,  /j/    ,  /w/            [ edit ]   Allophones   /s/  becomes an  alveolo-palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i]  for most speakers (but see  Differences in the language between North Korea and South Korea ). This occurs with the tense fricative and all the affricates as well. At the end of a syllable, /s/ changes to /t/ (Example: beoseot () 'mushroom').   /h/  may become a  bilabial   []  before  [o]  or  [u] , a  palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i] , a  velar   [x]  before  [] , a voiced  []  between voiced sounds, and a  [h]  elsewhere. [ citation needed ]   /p, t, , k/  become voiced  [b, d, , ]  between voiced sounds.   /l/  becomes alveolar flap  []  between vowels, and  [l]  or  []  at the end of a syllable or next to another  /l/ . Note that a written syllable-final '', when followed by a vowel or a glide ( i.e. , when the next character starts with ''), migrates to the next syllable and thus becomes  [] .   Traditionally,  /l/  was disallowed at the beginning of a word. It disappeared before  [j] , and otherwise became  /n/ . However, the inflow of western loanword changed the trend, and now word-initial  /l/  (mostly from English loanwords) are pronounced as a free variation of either  []  or  [l] . The traditional prohibition of word-initial  /l/  became a morphological rule called ""initial law"" () in South Korea, which pertains to Sino-Korean vocabulary. Such words retain their word-initial  /l/  in North Korea.   All  obstruents  (plosives, affricates, fricatives) are  unreleased   [p, t, k]  at the end of a word.   Plosive stops  /p, t, k/  become nasal stops  [m, n, ]  before nasal stops.   Hangul  spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying, partly historical  morphology . Given this, it is sometimes hard to tell which actual phonemes are present in a certain word.   One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial  [r] , and initial  [n] . For example,     ""labour"" - north:  r odong  (), south:  n odong  ()   ""history"" - north:  ry ksa  (), south:  y eoksa  ()   ""female"" - north:  ny ja  (), south:  y eoja  ()       [ edit ]   Morphophonemics   Grammatical morphemes may change shape depending on the preceding sounds. Examples include  -eun/-neun  (-/-) and  -i/-ga  (-/-). Sometimes sounds may be inserted instead. Examples include  -eul/-reul  (-/-),  -euro/-ro  (-/-),  -eseo/-seo  (-/-),  -ideunji/-deunji  (-/-) and  -iya/-ya  (-/-). However,  -euro/-ro  is somewhat irregular, since it will behave differently after a rieul consonant.     Korean particles     After a consonant   After a rieul   After a vowel       -ui  (-)       -eun  (-)   -neun  (-)       -i  (-)   -ga  (-)       -eul  (-)   -reul  (-)       -gwa  (-)   -wa  (-)       -euro  (-)   -ro  (-)       Some verbs may also change shape morphophonemically.     [ edit ]   Grammar   Main article:  Korean grammar     [ edit ]   Sentence structure   Korean is an  agglutinative language . Modifiers generally follow the modified word, and in the case of verb modifiers, can be serially appended. The basic form of a Korean sentence is  Subject Object Verb , but the verb is the only required and immovable element.       A :       -       -? (?)           kage-e     kasseo-yo           store + [location marker ()]     [go (verb root) ()]+[conjunctive ()]+[past ()]+[conjunctive ()]+ [polite marker ()]         ""Did [you] go to the store?"" (with ""you"" implied by context)         B :       .           ye           yes         ""Yes.""       [ edit ]   Parts of speech     [ edit ]   Verb   Korean  verbs  (  ,  tongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""action verbs"" or ""dynamic verbs"" to distinguish them from [  () ,  hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""]), which are also known as ""descriptive verbs"" or ""stative verbs"". Examples of action/dynamic verbs include    ( hada , ""to do"") and    ( kada , ""to go"") which constitute an action or movement as opposed to descriptive verbs such as    ( yehppeuda , ""to be beautiful""). For a larger list of Korean verbs, see  wikt:Category:Korean verbs .   Unlike most of the European languages, Korean does not conjugate verbs using agreement with the subject, and nouns have no gender. Instead, verb conjugations depend upon the verb tense, aspect, mood, and the social relation between the speaker, the subjects, and the listeners. The system of speech levels and honorifics loosely resembles the  T-V distinction  of most  Indo-European languages . For example, different endings are used based on the speaker's relation with the person they are talking to or the person about which they are talking. Politeness is a critical part of Korean language and Korean culture, therefore, when talking to someone esteemed, the correct verb ending, which should have a lot of respect, must be chosen.     [ edit ]   Adjective   Words categorized as Korean  adjectives  (  ,  hyeong-yongsa ,   ) conjugate similarly to verbs, so some English texts call them ""descriptive verbs"" or "" stative verbs "", but they are distinctly separate from    ( tongsa ).   English does not have an identical grammatical category, so the English translation of Korean adjectives may misleadingly suggest that they are verbs. For example,    ( pukda ) translates literally as ""to be red"" and    ( aswipda ) often best translates as ""to lack"" or ""to want for"", but both are    ( hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""). For a larger list of Korean adjectives, see  wikt:Category:Korean adjectives .     [ edit ]   Determiner   Korean  determiners  (  ,  gwanhyeongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""determinatives"", ""adnominals"", ""pre-nouns"", ""attributives"", and ""unconjugated adjectives"". Examples include    ( kak , ""each""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean determiners .     [ edit ]   Noun   A large body of Korean  nouns  (  ,  myeongsa ,   ) stem from  Chinese characters , e.g.    (,  san , mountain),    (,  yeok , station),    (,  munhwa , culture), etc. Others are native to the Korean language, e.g.    ( nara , country),    ( nal , day). Many  Sino-Korean words  have a native Korean equivalent and vice versa, but not always. Nouns do not have  grammatical gender  and can be made  plural  by adding  to the end of the word, however in most instances the  singular  form is used even when in English it would be translated as plural. For example, while in English the sentence  ""there are three apples""  would use the plural  ""apples""  instead of the singular  ""apple"" , the Korean sentence    ( sagwa segae isssumnida ) maintains the word  ( sagwa , ""apple"") in its singular form, thus rendered in English as ""apple three(things) exist."" For a list of Korean nouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean nouns .     [ edit ]   Pronoun   Main article:  Korean pronouns   Korean  pronouns  (  ,  daemyeongsa ,   ) are highly influenced by the honorifics in the language. Pronouns change forms depending on the social status of the person or persons spoken to, e.g. the pronoun for ""I"" there is both the informal    ( na ) and the honorific/humble    ( jeo ). In general second person singular pronouns are avoided, especially when using honorific forms. For a larger list or Korean pronouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean pronouns .     [ edit ]   Adverb   Korean  adverbs  (  ,  busa ,   ) include    ( tto , ""also"") and    ( gadeuk , ""fully""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean adverbs .     [ edit ]   Particle   Korean  particles  (  ,  josa ,   ) are also known in English as "" postpositions "". Examples include    ( neun , topic marker) and    ( reul , object marker). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean particles .     [ edit ]   Interjection   Korean  interjections  (  ,  gamtansa ,   ) are also known in English as ""exclamations"". Examples include    ( ani , ""no""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean interjections .     [ edit ]   Number   Main article:  Korean numerals   Korean  numbers  or numerals (  ,  sutja ,   ) consitute two regularly used sets: a native Korean set and a  Sino-Korean  set. The Sino-Korean system is nearly entirely based on the  Chinese numerals . The distinction between the two numeral systems is very important. Everything that can be counted will use one of the two systems, but seldom both. Sino-Korean words are sometimes used to mark ordinal usage: yeol beon ( ) means ""ten times"" while sip beon (() ()) means ""number ten."" The grouping of large numbers in Korean follow the Chinese tradition of myriads (10000) rather than thousands (1000) as is common in Europe and North America.     [ edit ]   Speech levels and honorifics   Main article:  Korean honorifics   The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean, and the grammar reflects this. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject referent is reflected in  honorifics , while that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in  speech level .     [ edit ]   Honorifics   When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a younger stranger, student, employee or the like. Nowadays, there are special endings which can be used on declarative, interrogative, and imperative sentences; and both honorific or normal sentences. They are made for easier and faster use of Korean.     [ edit ]   Speech levels   There are seven verb  paradigms  or  speech levels  in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation. [ citation needed ]  Unlike  honorifics   which are used to show respect towards the referent   speech levels  are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience. The names of the 7 levels are derived from the non-honorific  imperative  form of the verb    ( hada , ""do"") in each level, plus the suffix  ('che',  hanja :   ), which means ""style.""   The highest 6 levels are generally grouped together as  jondaenmal  (), while the lowest level ( haeche , ) is called  banmal  () in Korean.     [ edit ]   Vocabulary   The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words. Like Japanese and Vietnamese, more than 50% of the vocabulary (up to 60% by some estimates), especially words that denote abstract ideas, are  Sino-Korean words , [ 7 ]  either     directly borrowed from  Written Chinese , or   coined in Japan or Korea using  Chinese characters ,     in a similar way European languages borrow from Latin and Greek. Korean has two  number systems : one native, and one borrowed from Chinese.   To a much lesser extent, words have also occasionally been borrowed from  Mongolian ,  Sanskrit , and other languages. Conversely, the Korean language itself has also contributed some loanwords to other languages, most notably the  Tsushima dialect  of Japanese.   The vast majority of loanwords other than Sino-Korean come from modern times, 90% of which are from  English . [ 8 ]  Many words have also been borrowed from  Japanese  and  Western languages  such as  German  ( areubaiteu  part-time job,  allereugi  allergy). Some Western words were borrowed indirectly via Japanese, taking a Japanese sound pattern, for example dozen >     dsu  >     daseu . Most indirect Western borrowings are now written according to current Hangulization rules for the respective Western language, as if borrowed directly. There are a few more complicated borrowings such as German(y) (see  Names for Germany ), the first part of whose  endonym   [d.lant]  the Japanese approximated using the  kanji      doitsu  that were then accepted into the Korean language by their Sino-Korean pronunciation:     dok  +     il  =  Dogil . In South Korean official use, a number of other Sino-Korean country names have been replaced with phonetically oriented Hangulizations of the countries' endonyms or English names.   North Korean vocabulary shows a tendency to prefer native Korean over Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings, especially with recent political objectives aimed at eliminating foreign (mostly Chinese) influences on the Korean language in the North. By contrast, South Korean may have several Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings which tend to be absent in North Korean.     [ edit ]   Writing system       Korean writing systems           Hangul       Hanja       Hyangchal   Gugyeol   Idu       Mixed script       Korean romanization       Revised Romanization of Korean   McCune-Reischauer   Yale Romanization           Main article:  Hangul   See also:  Hangul consonant and vowel tables   In ancient times, the languages of the Korean peninsula were written using  Chinese characters , using  hyangchal  or  idu . Such systems were not popular because hanja is not well suited to the Korean language. Its use is now limited.   Korean is now mainly written in Hangul, the Korean alphabet promulgated in 1446 by  Sejong the Great ;  hanja may be mixed in  to write  Sino-Korean words . South Korea still teaches 1800 hanja characters in its schools, while the North abolished the use of hanja decades ago.   Below is a chart of the Korean alphabet's symbols and their canonical  IPA  values:     Consonants     Hangul                                                                        RR   b , p   d , t   j   g , k   pp   tt   jj   kk   p   t   ch   k   s   h   ss   m   n   ng       r , l           IPA   p   t      k   p   t      k   p   t      k   s   h   s   m   n      w   r   j         Vowels     Hangul                                                                      RR   i   e   oe   ae   a   o   u   eo   eu   ui   ye   yae   ya   yo   yu   yeo   wi   we   wae   wa   wo       IPA   i   e         a   o   u         i   je   j   ja   jo   ju   j   wi   we   w   wa   w       Modern Korean is written with  spaces  between  words , a feature not found in Chinese or Japanese. Korean  punctuation  marks are almost identical to Western ones. Traditionally, Korean was written in columns from top to bottom, right to left, but is now usually written in rows from left to right, top to bottom.     [ edit ]   Differences between North Korean and South Korean   Main article:  Korean language North-South differences   The Korean language used in the North and the South exhibits differences in pronunciation, spelling, grammar and vocabulary. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Pronunciation   In North Korea,  palatalization  of  /si/  is optional, and  //  can be pronounced as  [z]  in between vowels.   Words that are written the same way may be pronounced differently, such as the examples below. The pronunciations below are given in  Revised Romanization ,  McCune-Reischauer  and Hangul, the last of which represents what the Hangul would be if one writes the word as pronounced.       Word   Meaning   Pronunciation       North (RR/MR)   North (Hangul)   South (RR/MR)   South (Hangul)          wide   neo p tta (n p ta)      neo l tta (n l ta)             to read  (continuative form)   i l kko (i l ko)      i l kko (i l ko)             Amnok River   am r okgang (am r okkang)      am n okkang (am n okkang)             independence   dong r ip (tong r ip)      dong n ip (tong n ip)             idea / sense / conception   gwa ll yeom (kwa ll ym)      gwa nn yeom (kwa nn ym)          *   innovative   hyeoksin jj eok (hyksin tch k)      hyeoksin j eok (hyksin j k)          * Similar pronunciation is used in the North whenever the hanja """" is attached to a Sino-Korean word ending in ,  or . (In the South, this rule only applies when it is attached to any single-character Sino-Korean word.)     [ edit ]   Spelling   Some words are spelled differently by the North and the South, but the pronunciations are the same.       Word spelling   Meaning   Pronunciation (RR/MR)   Remarks       North   South             sunshine   haeppit (haepit)   The ""sai siot"" ('' used for indicating sound change) is almost never written out in the North.             cherry blossom   beotkkot (ptkkot)                cannot read   monnikda (monnikta)   Spacing.             Hallasan   hallasan (hallasan)   When a - combination is pronounced as  ll , the original Hangul spelling is kept in the North, while the Hangul is changed in the South.             rules   gyuyul (kyuyul)   In words where the original hanja is spelt """" or """" and follows a vowel, the initial  is not pronounced in the North, making the pronunciation identical with that in the South where the  is dropped in the spelling.         [ edit ]   Spelling and pronunciation   Some words have different spellings and pronunciations in the North and the South, some of which were given in the ""Phonology"" section above:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          ryeongryang (ryngryang)      yeongnyang (yngnyang)   strength   Korean words originally starting in  r  or  n  have their  r  or  n  dropped in the South Korean version if the sound following it is an  i  or  y  sound.          rodong (rodong)      nodong (nodong)   work   Korean words originally starting in  r  have their  r  changed to  n  in the South Korean version if the sound following it is a sound other than  i  or  y .          wonssu (wnssu)      wonsu (wnsu)   mortal enemy   ""Mortal enemy"" and ""head of state"" are homophones in the South. Possibly to avoid referring to  Kim Il-sung  /  Kim Jong-il  as the enemy, the second syllable of ""enemy"" is written and pronounced  in the North.          rajio (rajio)      radio (radio)   radio            u (u)      wi (wi)   on; above            anhae (anhae)      anae (anae)   wife            kkuba (kkuba)      kuba (k'uba)   Cuba   When transcribing foreign words from languages that do not have contrasts between aspirated and unaspirated stops, North Koreans generally use tensed stops for the unaspirated ones while South Koreans use aspirated stops in both cases.          pe (p'e)      pye (p'ye), pe (p'e)   lungs   All hanja pronounced as  pye  ( p'ye ) or  pe  ( p'e ) in the South are pronounced as  pe  ( p'e ) in the North. The spelling is also accordingly different.       In general, when transcribing place names, North Korea tends to use the pronunciation in the original language more than South Korea, which often uses the pronunciation in English. For example:       Original name   North Korea transliteration   English name   South Korea transliteration       Spelling   Pronunciation   Spelling   Pronunciaton       Ulaanbaatar      ullanbattareu (ullanbattar)   Ulan Bator      ullanbatoreu (ullanbat'or)       Kbenhavn      koeppenhabeun (k'oeppenhabn)   Copenhagen      kopenhagen (k'op'enhagen)       al-Qhirah      kkahira (kkahira)   Cairo      kairo (k'airo)         [ edit ]   Grammar   Some grammatical constructions are also different:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.

Although the Hangul differ, the pronunciations are the same (i.e. with the tensed  sound).         [ edit ]   Vocabulary   Some vocabulary is different between the North and the South:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          munhwajutaek (munhwajut'aek)      apateu (ap'at')   Apartment     (appateu/appat') is also used in the North.          joseonmal (chosnmal)      han-gugeo(han'gugeo)   Korean language            gwakbap (kwakpap)      dosirak (tosirak)   lunch box           [ edit ]   Others   In the North,  guillemets     and    are the symbols used for quotes; in the South, quotation marks equivalent to the English ones,  and , are standard, although     and     are sometimes used in popular novels.     [ edit ]   Study by non-native speakers   The  United States '  Defense Language Institute  classifies Korean alongside  Arabic ,  Chinese , and  Japanese  as a Category IV language, meaning that 63 weeks of instruction (as compared to just 25 weeks for  French ,  Spanish ,  Portuguese , and  Italian ) are required to bring an English-speaking student to a limited working level of proficiency in which he or she has ""sufficient capability to meet routine social demands and limited job requirements"" and ""can deal with concrete topics in past, present, and future tense."" [ 10 ]  As a result, the study of the Korean language in the United States is dominated by  Korean American  heritage language students; they are estimated to form over 80% of all students of the language at non-military universities. [ 11 ]   However, Korean is considerably easier for speakers of certain other languages, such as Japanese, Mongolian and Turkic languages; in Japan, it is more widely studied by non-heritage learners. [ 12 ]  The  Korean Language Proficiency Test , an examination aimed at assessing non-native speakers' competence in Korean, was instituted in 1997; 17,000 people applied for the 2005 sitting of the examination.

Korean  (  /  , see  below ) is the official  language  of  North Korea  and  South Korea . It is also one of the two official languages in the  Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture  in  China . There are about 78 million Korean speakers. It was formerly written using  Hanja , borrowed  Chinese characters  pronounced in the Korean way. In the 15th century a national writing system was developed by  Sejong the Great , nowadays called  Hangul .   The genealogical  classification  of the Korean language is debated. Some linguists place it in the  Altaic  language family, while others consider it to be a  language isolate . It is  agglutinative  in its morphology and  SOV  in its  syntax .

In South Korea, the language is most often called  Hangungmal  (  ;   ), or more formally,  Hangugeo  (  ;   ) or  Gugeo  (  ;   ; literally ""national language"").   In North Korea and Yanbian in China, the language is most often called  Chosnmal  (  ; with  hanja :   ), or more formally,  Chosn  (  ;   ).   On the other hand, Korean people in the  former USSR , who refer to themselves as  Koryo-saram  (also  Goryeoin  [  ;   ; literally, "" Goryeo  person(s)""]) call the language  Goryeomal  (  ;   ).   In  mainland China , following the establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992, the term  Choxiny  (   or short form:  Choy  (  )) has normally been used to refer to the language spoken in North Korea and Yanbian, while  Hnguy  (   or short form:  Hny  (  )) is used to refer to the language spoken in South Korea.   Some older English sources also used the name ""Korean"" to refer to the language, country, and people.     [ edit ]   History       Main article:  History of the Korean language       Korean is descended from  Old Korean  and  Middle Korean .     [ edit ]   Classification   The classification of the modern Korean language is uncertain, and due to the lack of any one generally accepted theory, it is sometimes described conservatively as a  language isolate .   On the other hand, since the publication of the article of  Ramstedt  in 1926, many linguists support the hypothesis that Korean can be classified as an  Altaic  language, or as a relative of proto-Altaic. Korean is similar to Altaic languages in that they both lack certain grammatical elements, including  number ,  gender ,  articles , fusional morphology, voice, and  relative pronouns  (Kim Namkil). Korean especially bears some  morphological  resemblance to some languages of the Northern Turkic group, namely  Sakha (Yakut) . Vinokurova, a scholar of the Sakha language, noted that like in Korean, and unlike in other  Turkic languages  or a variety of other languages surveyed, adverbs in Sakha are derived from verbs with the help of derivational morphology; however, she did not suggest this implied any relation between the two languages. [ 2 ]   It is also considered likely that Korean is related in some way to  Japanese , since the two languages have nearly identical grammatical structures, and share a number of possible phonological cognates (though a majority of them are likely due to local pronunciations of the Chinese characters from which they are derived), as noted by such researchers as  Samuel E. Martin  and  Roy Andrew Miller  in the late 1960s.  Sergei Starostin  (1991) found about 25% of potential cognates in the Japanese-Korean 100-word  Swadesh list , which places these two languages closer together than other possible members of the Altaic family. [ 3 ]   Genetic relationships have been postulated both directly and indirectly, the latter either through placing both languages in the Altaic family, or by arguing for a relationship between Japanese and the  Buyeo languages  of  Goguryeo  and  Baekje  (see below); the proposed Baekje relationship is supported by cognates such as Baekje  mir , Japanese  mi-  ""three"". [ 4 ]   The possible relationship between Korean and Japanese can be exemplified by such basic vocabularly items as J.     mizu  (Old J.  midu ) : K.     mul  (Middle K.  mirh ) ""water"",  mot  ""lake""; J.     ku-ru  ""come"" (Old J.  ku , also cf. irregular root changes as in past tense   ki-ta , negative   ko-nai  in Modern J.) : K.     ka-da  (""go""); J.     kata-i  ""hard"" (whence     kata-na  ""knife, sword"") : K.  kud-yn  (hard); J.     i-ru  ""to be"" (past tense   i-ta ) : K.     i-da  ""to be""; J.  na ,  -en  : K.  anh  ""not"", J.  minna  (Old J.  mynna ) ""all, everyone"" : K.  manh-  ""many"" (predicate  mana-da ), etc.  [ 5 ] . The same possible cognates are often observed in other members of the potential  Altaic family , esp. in the  Tungusic languages . Cf. Nanay  mue  ""water"",  giagda-  ""to walk"",  anaa, anna  ""not"".   Others argue, however, that the similarities are not due to any genetic relationship, but rather to a  sprachbund  effect. See  East Asian languages  for morphological features shared among languages of the East Asian  sprachbund , and  Japanese language classification  for further details on the possible relationship.   It is presumed that modern Korean may be more closely related to the languages of  Samhan  and  Silla  than the Buyeo languages; many Korean scholars believe they were mutually intelligible, and the collective basis of what in the  Goryeo  period would merge to become Middle Korean (the language before the changes that the  Seven-Year War  brought) and eventually Modern Korean. The  Jeju dialect  preserves some archaic features that can also be found in Middle Korean, whose  arae a  is retained in the dialect as a distinct vowel.   There are also more marginal hypotheses proposing various other relationships; for example, a few scholars, such as  Homer B. Hulbert  (1905), have tried to relate Korean to the  Dravidian languages  through the similar syntax in both. [ 6 ]   Though not related to Chinese, it has borrowed heavily; see the Vocabulary section below.     [ edit ]   Dialects       Main article:  Korean dialects              Dialects of Korean       Korean has several  dialects  (called  mal  [literally ""speech""],  saturi , or  bang-eon  in Korean). The  standard language  ( pyojuneo  or  pyojunmal ) of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  P'yngyang . These dialects are similar, and are in fact all mutually intelligible, perhaps with the exception of the dialect of  Jeju Island  (see  Jeju dialect ). The dialect spoken in Jeju is in fact classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of  Seoul dialect  use very little stress, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of the  Gyeongsang dialect  have a very pronounced intonation.   It is also worth noting that there is substantial evidence for a history of extensive  dialect levelling , or even  convergent evolution  or intermixture of two or more originally distinct linguistic stocks, within the Korean language and its dialects. Many Korean dialects have basic vocabulary that is etymologically distinct from vocabulary of identical meaning in Standard Korean or other dialects, such as South Jeolla dialect /kur/ vs. Standard Korean     /ip/  ""mouth"" or Gyeongsang dialect  /.u.i/  vs. Standard Korean  /puu/  "" garlic chives ."" This suggests that the Korean Peninsula may have at one time been much more linguistically diverse than it is at present. [ citation needed ]  See also the  Buyeo languages   hypothesis .   There is a very close connection between the dialects of Korean and the  regions of Korea , since the boundaries of both are largely determined by mountains and seas. Here is a list of traditional dialect names and locations:       Standard dialect   Where used       Seoul   Seoul  (),  Incheon  (/), most of  Gyeonggi  (/)       P'yngan  (/)   P'yngyang ,  P'yngan  region,  Chagang  (North Korea)       Regional dialect   Where used       Gyeonggi   limited areas of the  Gyeonggi  region (South Korea)       Chungcheong   Daejeon ,  Chungcheong  region (South Korea)       Gangwon   Gangwon-do (South Korea) / Kangwn (North Korea)       Gyeongsang   Busan ,  Daegu ,  Ulsan ,  Gyeongsang  region (South Korea)       Hamgyng   Rasn ,  Hamgyng  region,  Ryanggang  (North Korea)       Hwanghae   Hwanghae  region (North Korea)       Jeju   Jeju Island/Province  (South Korea)       Jeolla   Gwangju ,  Jeolla  region (South Korea)         [ edit ]   Phonology       This article contains  IPA  phonetic symbols.

Main article:  Korean phonology         [ edit ]   Consonants          The Korean consonants             Bilabial   Alveolar   Post-  alveolar   Velar   Glottal       Nasal      /m/      /n/        //  (syllable-final)         Plosive  and   Affricate   plain      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         tense      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         aspirated      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         Fricative   plain        /s/          /h/       tense        /s/             Liquid        /l/           The  IPA  symbol <  > (a subscript double straight quotation mark, shown here with a placeholder circle) is used to denote the tensed consonants  /p/, /t/, /k/, //, /s/ . Its official use in the  Extensions to the IPA  is for  'strong'  articulation, but is used in the literature for  faucalized voice . The Korean consonants also have elements of  stiff voice , but it is not yet known how typical this is of faucalized consonants. They are produced with a partially constricted  glottis  and additional subglottal pressure in addition to tense vocal tract walls, laryngeal lowering, or other expansion of the larynx.     [ edit ]   Vowels                    The Korean basic vowels                 Monophthongs   /i/    ,  /e/    ,  //    ,  /a/    ,  /o/    ,  /u/    ,  //    ,  //    ,  //          Vowels preceded by intermediaries,  or Diphthongs   /je/    ,  /j/    ,  /ja/    ,  /wi/    ,  /we/    ,  /w/    ,  /wa/    ,  /i/    ,  /jo/    ,  /ju/    ,  /j/    ,  /w/            [ edit ]   Allophones   /s/  becomes an  alveolo-palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i]  for most speakers (but see  Differences in the language between North Korea and South Korea ). This occurs with the tense fricative and all the affricates as well. At the end of a syllable, /s/ changes to /t/ (Example: beoseot () 'mushroom').   /h/  may become a  bilabial   []  before  [o]  or  [u] , a  palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i] , a  velar   [x]  before  [] , a voiced  []  between voiced sounds, and a  [h]  elsewhere. [ citation needed ]   /p, t, , k/  become voiced  [b, d, , ]  between voiced sounds.   /l/  becomes alveolar flap  []  between vowels, and  [l]  or  []  at the end of a syllable or next to another  /l/ . Note that a written syllable-final '', when followed by a vowel or a glide ( i.e. , when the next character starts with ''), migrates to the next syllable and thus becomes  [] .   Traditionally,  /l/  was disallowed at the beginning of a word. It disappeared before  [j] , and otherwise became  /n/ . However, the inflow of western loanword changed the trend, and now word-initial  /l/  (mostly from English loanwords) are pronounced as a free variation of either  []  or  [l] . The traditional prohibition of word-initial  /l/  became a morphological rule called ""initial law"" () in South Korea, which pertains to Sino-Korean vocabulary. Such words retain their word-initial  /l/  in North Korea.   All  obstruents  (plosives, affricates, fricatives) are  unreleased   [p, t, k]  at the end of a word.   Plosive stops  /p, t, k/  become nasal stops  [m, n, ]  before nasal stops.   Hangul  spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying, partly historical  morphology . Given this, it is sometimes hard to tell which actual phonemes are present in a certain word.   One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial  [r] , and initial  [n] . For example,     ""labour"" - north:  r odong  (), south:  n odong  ()   ""history"" - north:  ry ksa  (), south:  y eoksa  ()   ""female"" - north:  ny ja  (), south:  y eoja  ()       [ edit ]   Morphophonemics   Grammatical morphemes may change shape depending on the preceding sounds. Examples include  -eun/-neun  (-/-) and  -i/-ga  (-/-). Sometimes sounds may be inserted instead. Examples include  -eul/-reul  (-/-),  -euro/-ro  (-/-),  -eseo/-seo  (-/-),  -ideunji/-deunji  (-/-) and  -iya/-ya  (-/-). However,  -euro/-ro  is somewhat irregular, since it will behave differently after a rieul consonant.     Korean particles     After a consonant   After a rieul   After a vowel       -ui  (-)       -eun  (-)   -neun  (-)       -i  (-)   -ga  (-)       -eul  (-)   -reul  (-)       -gwa  (-)   -wa  (-)       -euro  (-)   -ro  (-)       Some verbs may also change shape morphophonemically.     [ edit ]   Grammar       Main article:  Korean grammar         [ edit ]   Sentence structure   Korean is an  agglutinative language . Modifiers generally follow the modified word, and in the case of verb modifiers, can be serially appended. The basic form of a Korean sentence is  Subject Object Verb , but the verb is the only required and immovable element.       A :       -       -? (?)           gage-e     gasseo-yo           store + [location marker ()]     [go (verb root) ()]+[conjunctive ()]+[past ()]+[conjunctive ()]+ [interrogative marker ()]         ""Did [you] go to the store?"" (with ""you"" implied by context)         B :       .           ne           yes         ""Yes.""       [ edit ]   Parts of speech     [ edit ]   Verb   Korean  verbs  (  ,  dongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""action verbs"" or ""dynamic verbs"" to distinguish them from [  () ,  hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""]), which are also known as ""descriptive verbs"" or ""stative verbs"". Examples of action/dynamic verbs include    ( hada , ""to do, to have"") and    ( gada , ""to go"") which constitute an action or movement as opposed to descriptive verbs such as    ( yehppeuda , ""to be beautiful""). For a larger list of Korean verbs, see  wikt:Category:Korean verbs .   Unlike most of the European languages, Korean does not conjugate verbs using agreement with the subject, and nouns have no gender. Instead, verb conjugations depend upon the verb tense, aspect, mood, and the social relation between the speaker, the subjects, and the listeners. The system of speech levels and honorifics loosely resembles the  T-V distinction  of most  Indo-European languages . For example, different endings are used based on whether the subjects and listeners are friends, parents, or honoured persons.     [ edit ]   Adjective   Words categorized as Korean  adjectives  (  ,  hyeong-yongsa ,   ) conjugate similarly to verbs, so some English texts call them ""descriptive verbs"" or "" stative verbs "", but they are distinctly separate from    ( dongsa ).   English does not have an identical grammatical category, so the English translation of Korean adjectives may misleadingly suggest that they are verbs. For example,    ( bukda ) translates literally as ""to be red"" and    ( aswipda ) often best translates as ""to lack"" or ""to want for"", but both are    ( hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""). For a larger list of Korean adjectives, see  wikt:Category:Korean adjectives .     [ edit ]   Determiner   Korean  determiners  (  ,  gwanhyeongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""determinatives"", ""adnominals"", ""pre-nouns"", ""attributives"", and ""unconjugated adjectives"". Examples include    ( gak , ""each""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean determiners .     [ edit ]   Noun   A large body of Korean  nouns  (  ,  myeongsa ,   ) stem from  Chinese characters , e.g.    (,  san , mountain),    (,  yeok , station),    (,  munhwa , culture), etc. Others are native to the Korean language, e.g.    ( nara , country),    ( nal , day). Many  Sino-Korean words  have a native Korean equivalent and vice versa, but not always. Nouns do not have  grammatical gender  and can be made  plural  by adding  to the end of the word, however in most instances the  singular  form is used even when in English it would be translated as plural. For example, while in English the sentence  ""there are three apples""  would use the plural  ""apples""  instead of the singular  ""apple"" , the Korean sentence    ( sagwa segae isssumnida ) maintains the word  ( sagwa , ""apple"") in its singular form, thus rendered in English as ""apple three(things) exist."" For a list of Korean nouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean nouns .     [ edit ]   Pronoun       Main article:  Korean pronouns       Korean  pronouns  (  ,  daemyeongsa ,   ) are highly influenced by the honorifics in the language. Pronouns change forms depending on the social status of the person or persons spoken to, e.g. the pronoun for ""I"" there is both the informal    ( na ) and the honorific/humble    ( jeo ). In general second person singular pronouns are avoided, especially when using honorific forms. For a larger list or Korean pronouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean pronouns .     [ edit ]   Adverb   Korean  adverbs  (  ,  busa ,   ) include    ( tto , ""also"") and    ( gadeuk , ""fully""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean adverbs .     [ edit ]   Particle   Korean  particles  (  ,  josa ,   ) are also known in English as "" postpositions "". Examples include    ( neun , topic marker) and    ( reul , object marker). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean particles .     [ edit ]   Interjection   Korean  interjections  (  ,  gamtansa ,   ) are also known in English as ""exclamations"". Examples include    ( ani , ""no""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean interjections .     [ edit ]   Number       Main article:  Korean numerals       Korean  numbers  or numerals (  ,  sutja ,   ) consitute two regularly used sets: a native Korean set and a  Sino-Korean  set. The Sino-Korean system is nearly entirely based on the  Chinese numerals . The distinction between the two numeral systems is very important. Everything that can be counted will use one of the two systems, but seldom both. Sino-Korean words are sometimes used to mark ordinal usage: yeol beon ( ) means ""ten times"" while sip beon (() ()) means ""number ten."" The grouping of large numbers in Korean follow the Chinese tradition of myriads (10000) rather than thousands (1000) as is common in Europe and North America.     [ edit ]   Speech levels and honorifics       Main article:  Korean honorifics       The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean, and the grammar reflects this. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject referent is reflected in  honorifics , while that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in  speech level .     [ edit ]   Honorifics   When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a younger stranger, student, employee or the like. Nowadays, there are special endings which can be used on declarative, interrogative, and imperative sentences; and both honorific or normal sentences. They are made for easier and faster use of Korean.     [ edit ]   Speech levels   There are seven verb  paradigms  or  speech levels  in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation. [ citation needed ]  Unlike  honorifics   which are used to show respect towards the referent   speech levels  are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience. The names of the 7 levels are derived from the non-honorific  imperative  form of the verb    ( hada , ""do"") in each level, plus the suffix  ('che',  hanja :   ), which means ""style.""   The highest 6 levels are generally grouped together as  jondaenmal  (), while the lowest level ( haeche , ) is called  banmal  () in Korean.     [ edit ]   Vocabulary   The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words. Like Japanese and Vietnamese, more than 50% of the vocabulary (up to 60% by some estimates), especially words that denote abstract ideas, are  Sino-Korean words , [ 7 ]  either     directly borrowed from  Written Chinese , or   coined in Japan or Korea using  Chinese characters ,     in a similar way European languages borrow from Latin and Greek. Korean has two  number systems : one native, and one borrowed from Chinese.   To a much lesser extent, words have also occasionally been borrowed from  Mongolian ,  Sanskrit , and other languages. Conversely, the Korean language itself has also contributed some loanwords to other languages, most notably the  Tsushima dialect  of Japanese.   The vast majority of loanwords other than Sino-Korean come from modern times, 90% of which are from  English . [ 8 ]  Many words have also been borrowed from  Japanese  and  Western languages  such as  German  ( areubaiteu  part-time job,  allereugi  allergy). Some Western words were borrowed indirectly via Japanese, taking a Japanese sound pattern, for example dozen >     dsu  >     daseu . Most indirect Western borrowings are now written according to current Hangulization rules for the respective Western language, as if borrowed directly. There are a few more complicated borrowings such as German(y) (see  Names for Germany ), the first part of whose  endonym   [d.lant]  the Japanese approximated using the  kanji      doitsu  that were then accepted into the Korean language by their Sino-Korean pronunciation:     dok  +     il  =  Dogil . In South Korean official use, a number of other Sino-Korean country names have been replaced with phonetically oriented Hangulizations of the countries' endonyms or English names.   North Korean vocabulary shows a tendency to prefer native Korean over Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings, especially with recent political objectives aimed at eliminating foreign (mostly Chinese) influences on the Korean language in the North. By contrast, South Korean may have several Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings which tend to be absent in North Korean.     [ edit ]   Writing system       Korean writing systems           Hangul       Hanja       Hyangchal   Gugyeol   Idu       Mixed script       Korean romanization       Revised Romanization of Korean   McCune-Reischauer   Yale Romanization               Main article:  Hangul     See also:  Hangul consonant and vowel tables     In ancient times, the languages of the Korean peninsula were written using  Chinese characters , using  hyangchal  or  idu . Such systems were not popular because hanja is not well suited to the Korean language. Its use limited some cases and the aristocracy prefers  Classical Chinese  for its writing.   Korean is now mainly written in Hangul, the Korean alphabet promulgated in 1446 by  Sejong the Great ;  hanja may be mixed in  to write  Sino-Korean words . South Korea still teaches 1800 hanja characters in its schools, while the North abolished the use of hanja decades ago.   Below is a chart of the Korean alphabet's symbols and their canonical  IPA  values:     Consonants     Hangul                                                                        RR   b , p   d , t   j   g , k   pp   tt   jj   kk   p   t   ch   k   s   h   ss   m   n   ng       r , l           IPA   p   t      k   p   t      k   p   t      k   s   h   s   m   n      w   r   j         Vowels     Hangul                                                                      RR   i   e   oe   ae   a   o   u   eo   eu   ui   ye   yae   ya   yo   yu   yeo   wi   we   wae   wa   wo       IPA   i   e         a   o   u         i   je   j   ja   jo   ju   j   wi   we   w   wa   w       Modern Korean is written with  spaces  between  words , a feature not found in Chinese or Japanese. Korean  punctuation  marks are almost identical to Western ones. Traditionally, Korean was written in columns from top to bottom, right to left, but is now usually written in rows from left to right, top to bottom.     [ edit ]   Differences between North Korean and South Korean       Main article:  Korean language North-South differences       The Korean language used in the North and the South exhibits differences in pronunciation, spelling, grammar and vocabulary. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Pronunciation   In North Korea,  palatalization  of  /si/  is optional, and  //  can be pronounced as  [z]  in between vowels.   Words that are written the same way may be pronounced differently, such as the examples below. The pronunciations below are given in  Revised Romanization ,  McCune-Reischauer  and Hangul, the last of which represents what the Hangul would be if one writes the word as pronounced.       Word   Meaning   Pronunciation       North (RR/MR)   North (Hangul)   South (RR/MR)   South (Hangul)          wide   neo p tta (n p ta)      neo l tta (n l ta)             to read  (continuative form)   i l kko (i l ko)      i l kko (i l ko)             Amnok River   am r okgang (am r okkang)      am n okkang (am n okkang)             independence   dong r ip (tong r ip)      dong n ip (tong n ip)             idea / sense / conception   gwa ll yeom (kwa ll ym)      gwa nn yeom (kwa nn ym)          *   innovative   hyeoksin jj eok (hyksin tch k)      hyeoksin j eok (hyksin j k)          * Similar pronunciation is used in the North whenever the hanja """" is attached to a Sino-Korean word ending in ,  or . (In the South, this rule only applies when it is attached to any single-character Sino-Korean word.)     [ edit ]   Spelling   Some words are spelled differently by the North and the South, but the pronunciations are the same.       Word spelling   Meaning   Pronunciation (RR/MR)   Remarks       North   South             sunshine   haeppit (haepit)   The ""sai siot"" ('' used for indicating sound change) is almost never written out in the North.             cherry blossom   beotkkot (ptkkot)                cannot read   monnikda (monnikta)   Spacing.             Hallasan   hallasan (hallasan)   When a - combination is pronounced as  ll , the original Hangul spelling is kept in the North, while the Hangul is changed in the South.             rules   gyuyul (kyuyul)   In words where the original hanja is spelt """" or """" and follows a vowel, the initial  is not pronounced in the North, making the pronunciation identical with that in the South where the  is dropped in the spelling.         [ edit ]   Spelling and pronunciation   Some words have different spellings and pronunciations in the North and the South, some of which were given in the ""Phonology"" section above:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          ryeongryang (ryngryang)      yeongnyang (yngnyang)   strength   Korean words originally starting in  r  or  n  have their  r  or  n  dropped in the South Korean version if the sound following it is an  i  or  y  sound.          rodong (rodong)      nodong (nodong)   work   Korean words originally starting in  r  have their  r  changed to  n  in the South Korean version if the sound following it is a sound other than  i  or  y .          wonssu (wnssu)      wonsu (wnsu)   mortal enemy   ""Mortal enemy"" and ""head of state"" are homophones in the South. Possibly to avoid referring to  Kim Il-sung  /  Kim Jong-il  as the enemy, the second syllable of ""enemy"" is written and pronounced  in the North.          rajio (rajio)      radio (radio)   radio            u (u)      wi (wi)   on; above            anhae (anhae)      anae (anae)   wife            kkuba (kkuba)      kuba (k'uba)   Cuba   When transcribing foreign words from languages that do not have contrasts between aspirated and unaspirated stops, North Koreans generally use tensed stops for the unaspirated ones while South Koreans use aspirated stops in both cases.          pe (p'e)      pye (p'ye), pe (p'e)   lungs   All hanja pronounced as  pye  ( p'ye ) or  pe  ( p'e ) in the South are pronounced as  pe  ( p'e ) in the North. The spelling is also accordingly different.       In general, when transcribing place names, North Korea tends to use the pronunciation in the original language more than South Korea, which often uses the pronunciation in English. For example:       Original name   North Korea transliteration   English name   South Korea transliteration       Spelling   Pronunciation   Spelling   Pronunciaton       Ulaanbaatar      ullanbattareu (ullanbattar)   Ulan Bator      ullanbatoreu (ullanbat'or)       Kbenhavn      koeppenhabeun (k'oeppenhabn)   Copenhagen      kopenhagen (k'op'enhagen)       al-Qhirah      kkahira (kkahira)   Cairo      kairo (k'airo)         [ edit ]   Grammar   Some grammatical constructions are also different:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          doeyeotda (toeytta)      doeeotda (toetta)   past tense of  (doeda/toeda), ""to become""   All similar grammar forms of verbs or adjectives that end in  in the stem (i.e. , , , ,  and ) in the North use  instead of the South's .          gomawayo (komawayo)      gomawoyo (komawyo)   thanks   -irregular verbs in the North use  (wa) for all those with a positive ending vowel; this only happens in the South if the verb stem has only one syllable.          halgayo (halkayo)      halkkayo (halkkayo)   Shall we do?   Although the Hangul differ, the pronunciations are the same (i.e. with the tensed  sound).         [ edit ]   Vocabulary   Some vocabulary is different between the North and the South:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          munhwajutaek (munhwajut'aek)      apateu (ap'at')   Apartment     (appateu/appat') is also used in the North.          joseonmal (chosnmal)      han-gugeo(han'gugeo)   Korean language            gwakbap (kwakpap)      dosirak (tosirak)   lunch box           [ edit ]   Others   In the North,  guillemets     and    are the symbols used for quotes; in the South, quotation marks equivalent to the English ones,  and , are standard, although     and     are sometimes used in popular novels.     [ edit ]   Study by non-native speakers   The  United States '  Defense Language Institute  classifies Korean alongside  Arabic ,  Chinese , and  Japanese  as a Category IV language, meaning that 63 weeks of instruction (as compared to just 25 weeks for  French ,  Spanish ,  Portuguese , and  Italian ) are required to bring an English-speaking student to a limited working level of proficiency in which he or she has ""sufficient capability to meet routine social demands and limited job requirements"" and ""can deal with concrete topics in past, present, and future tense."" [ 10 ]  As a result, the study of the Korean language in the United States is dominated by  Korean American  heritage language students; they are estimated to form over 80% of all students of the language at non-military universities. [ 11 ]   However, Korean is considerably easier for speakers of certain other languages, such as Japanese, Mongolian and Turkic languages; in Japan, it is more widely studied by non-heritage learners. [ 12 ]  The  Korean Language Proficiency Test , an examination aimed at assessing non-native speakers' competence in Korean, was instituted in 1997; 17,000 people applied for the 2005 sitting of the examination.

Korean  (  /  , see  below ) is the official  language  of  North Korea  and  South Korea . It is also one of the two official languages in the  Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture  in  China . There are about 78 million Korean speakers. It was formerly written using  Hanja , borrowed  Chinese characters  pronounced in the Korean way. In the 15th century a national writing system was developed by  Sejong the Great , nowadays called  Hangul .   The genealogical  classification  of the Korean language is debated. Some linguists place it in the  Altaic  language family, while others consider it to be a  language isolate . It is  agglutinative  in its morphology and  SOV  in its  syntax .

In South Korea, the language is most often called  Hangungmal  (  ;   ), or more formally,  Hangugeo  (  ;   ) or  Gugeo  (  ;   ; literally ""national language"").   In North Korea and Yanbian in China, the language is most often called  Chosnmal  (  ; with  hanja :   ), or more formally,  Chosn  (  ;   ).   On the other hand, Korean people in the  former USSR , who refer to themselves as  Koryo-saram  (also  Goryeoin  [  ;   ; literally, "" Goryeo  person(s)""]) call the language  Goryeomal  (  ;   ).   In  mainland China , following the establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992, the term  Choxiny  (   or short form:  Choy  (  )) has normally been used to refer to the language spoken in North Korea and Yanbian, while  Hnguy  (   or short form:  Hny  (  )) is used to refer to the language spoken in South Korea.   Some older English sources also used the name ""Korean"" to refer to the language, country, and people.     [ edit ]   History       Main article:  History of the Korean language       Korean is descended from  Old Korean  and  Middle Korean .     [ edit ]   Classification   The classification of the modern Korean language is uncertain, and due to the lack of any one generally accepted theory, it is sometimes described conservatively as a  language isolate .   On the other hand, since the publication of the article of  Ramstedt  in 1926, many linguists support the hypothesis that Korean can be classified as an  Altaic  language, or as a relative of proto-Altaic. Korean is similar to Altaic languages in that they both lack certain grammatical elements, including  number ,  gender ,  articles , fusional morphology, voice, and  relative pronouns  (Kim Namkil). Korean especially bears some  morphological  resemblance to some languages of the Northern Turkic group, namely  Sakha (Yakut) . Vinokurova, a scholar of the Sakha language, noted that like in Korean, and unlike in other  Turkic languages  or a variety of other languages surveyed, adverbs in Sakha are derived from verbs with the help of derivational morphology; however, she did not suggest this implied any relation between the two languages. [ 2 ]   It is also considered likely that Korean is related in some way to  Japanese , since the two languages have nearly identical grammatical structures, and share a number of possible phonological cognates (though a majority of them are likely due to local pronunciations of the Chinese characters from which they are derived), as noted by such researchers as  Samuel E. Martin  and  Roy Andrew Miller  in the late 1960s.  Sergei Starostin  (1991) found about 25% of potential cognates in the Japanese-Korean 100-word  Swadesh list , which places these two languages closer together than other possible members of the Altaic family. [ 3 ]   Genetic relationships have been postulated both directly and indirectly, the latter either through placing both languages in the Altaic family, or by arguing for a relationship between Japanese and the  Buyeo languages  of  Goguryeo  and  Baekje  (see below); the proposed Baekje relationship is supported by cognates such as Baekje  mir , Japanese  mi-  ""three"". [ 4 ]   The possible relationship between Korean and Japanese can be exemplified by such basic vocabularly items as J.     mizu  (Old J.  midu ) : K.     mul  (Middle K.  mirh ) ""water"",  mot  ""lake""; J.     ku-ru  ""come"" (Old J.  ku , also cf. irregular root changes as in past tense   ki-ta , negative   ko-nai  in Modern J.) : K.     ka-da  (""go""); J.     kata-i  ""hard"" (whence     kata-na  ""knife, sword"") : K.  kud-yn  (hard); J.     i-ru  ""to be"" (past tense   i-ta ) : K.     i-da  ""to be""; J.  na ,  -en  : K.  anh  ""not"", J.  minna  (Old J.  mynna ) ""all, everyone"" : K.  manh-  ""many"" (predicate  mana-da ), etc.  [ 5 ] . The same possible cognates are often observed in other members of the potential  Altaic family , esp. in the  Tungusic languages . Cf. Nanay  mue  ""water"",  giagda-  ""to walk"",  anaa, anna  ""not"".   Others argue, however, that the similarities are not due to any genetic relationship, but rather to a  sprachbund  effect. See  East Asian languages  for morphological features shared among languages of the East Asian  sprachbund , and  Japanese language classification  for further details on the possible relationship.   It is presumed that modern Korean may be more closely related to the languages of  Samhan  and  Silla  than the Buyeo languages; many Korean scholars believe they were mutually intelligible, and the collective basis of what in the  Goryeo  period would merge to become Middle Korean (the language before the changes that the  Seven-Year War  brought) and eventually Modern Korean. The  Jeju dialect  preserves some archaic features that can also be found in Middle Korean, whose  arae a  is retained in the dialect as a distinct vowel.   There are also more marginal hypotheses proposing various other relationships; for example, a few scholars, such as  Homer B. Hulbert  (1905), have tried to relate Korean to the  Dravidian languages  through the similar syntax in both. [ 6 ]   Though not related to Chinese, it has borrowed heavily; see the Vocabulary section below.     [ edit ]   Dialects       Main article:  Korean dialects              Dialects of Korean       Korean has several  dialects  (called  mal  [literally ""speech""],  saturi , or  bang-eon  in Korean). The  standard language  ( pyojuneo  or  pyojunmal ) of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  P'yngyang . These dialects are similar, and are in fact all mutually intelligible, perhaps with the exception of the dialect of  Jeju Island  (see  Jeju dialect ). The dialect spoken in Jeju is in fact classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of  Seoul dialect  use very little stress, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of the  Gyeongsang dialect  have a very pronounced intonation.   It is also worth noting that there is substantial evidence for a history of extensive  dialect levelling , or even  convergent evolution  or intermixture of two or more originally distinct linguistic stocks, within the Korean language and its dialects. Many Korean dialects have basic vocabulary that is etymologically distinct from vocabulary of identical meaning in Standard Korean or other dialects, such as South Jeolla dialect /kur/ vs. Standard Korean     /ip/  ""mouth"" or Gyeongsang dialect  /.u.i/  vs. Standard Korean  /puu/  "" garlic chives ."" This suggests that the Korean Peninsula may have at one time been much more linguistically diverse than it is at present. [ citation needed ]  See also the  Buyeo languages   hypothesis .   There is a very close connection between the dialects of Korean and the  regions of Korea , since the boundaries of both are largely determined by mountains and seas. Here is a list of traditional dialect names and locations:       Standard dialect   Where used       Seoul   Seoul  (),  Incheon  (/), most of  Gyeonggi  (/)       P'yngan  (/)   P'yngyang ,  P'yngan  region,  Chagang  (North Korea)       Regional dialect   Where used       Gyeonggi   limited areas of the  Gyeonggi  region (South Korea)       Chungcheong   Daejeon ,  Chungcheong  region (South Korea)       Gangwon   Gangwon-do (South Korea) / Kangwn (North Korea)       Gyeongsang   Busan ,  Daegu ,  Ulsan ,  Gyeongsang  region (South Korea)       Hamgyng   Rasn ,  Hamgyng  region,  Ryanggang  (North Korea)       Hwanghae   Hwanghae  region (North Korea)       Jeju   Jeju Island/Province  (South Korea)       Jeolla   Gwangju ,  Jeolla  region (South Korea)         [ edit ]   Phonology       This article contains  IPA  phonetic symbols.  Without proper  rendering support , you may see  question marks, boxes, or other symbols  instead of  Unicode  characters.           Main article:  Korean phonology         [ edit ]   Consonants          The Korean consonants             Bilabial   Alveolar   Post-  alveolar   Velar   Glottal       Nasal      /m/      /n/        //  (syllable-final)         Plosive  and   Affricate   plain      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         tense      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         aspirated      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         Fricative   plain        /s/          /h/       tense        /s/             Liquid        /l/           The  IPA  symbol <  > (a subscript double straight quotation mark, shown here with a placeholder circle) is used to denote the tensed consonants  /p/, /t/, /k/, //, /s/ . Its official use in the  Extensions to the IPA  is for  'strong'  articulation, but is used in the literature for  faucalized voice . The Korean consonants also have elements of  stiff voice , but it is not yet known how typical this is of faucalized consonants. They are produced with a partially constricted  glottis  and additional subglottal pressure in addition to tense vocal tract walls, laryngeal lowering, or other expansion of the larynx.     [ edit ]   Vowels                    The Korean basic vowels                 Monophthongs   /i/    ,  /e/    ,  //    ,  /a/    ,  /o/    ,  /u/    ,  //    ,  //    ,  //          Vowels preceded by intermediaries,  or Diphthongs   /je/    ,  /j/    ,  /ja/    ,  /wi/    ,  /we/    ,  /w/    ,  /wa/    ,  /i/    ,  /jo/    ,  /ju/    ,  /j/    ,  /w/            [ edit ]   Allophones   /s/  becomes an  alveolo-palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i]  for most speakers (but see  Differences in the language between North Korea and South Korea ). This occurs with the tense fricative and all the affricates as well. At the end of a syllable, /s/ changes to /t/ (Example: beoseot () 'mushroom').   /h/  may become a  bilabial   []  before  [o]  or  [u] , a  palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i] , a  velar   [x]  before  [] , a voiced  []  between voiced sounds, and a  [h]  elsewhere. [ citation needed ]   /p, t, , k/  become voiced  [b, d, , ]  between voiced sounds.   /l/  becomes alveolar flap  []  between vowels, and  [l]  or  []  at the end of a syllable or next to another  /l/ . Note that a written syllable-final '', when followed by a vowel or a glide ( i.e. , when the next character starts with ''), migrates to the next syllable and thus becomes  [] .   Traditionally,  /l/  was disallowed at the beginning of a word. It disappeared before  [j] , and otherwise became  /n/ . However, the inflow of western loanword changed the trend, and now word-initial  /l/  (mostly from English loanwords) are pronounced as a free variation of either  []  or  [l] . The traditional prohibition of word-initial  /l/  became a morphological rule called ""initial law"" () in South Korea, which pertains to Sino-Korean vocabulary. Such words retain their word-initial  /l/  in North Korea.   All  obstruents  (plosives, affricates, fricatives) are  unreleased   [p, t, k]  at the end of a word.   Plosive stops  /p, t, k/  become nasal stops  [m, n, ]  before nasal stops.   Hangul  spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying, partly historical  morphology . Given this, it is sometimes hard to tell which actual phonemes are present in a certain word.   One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial  [r] , and initial  [n] . For example,     ""labour"" - north:  r odong  (), south:  n odong  ()   ""history"" - north:  ry ksa  (), south:  y eoksa  ()   ""female"" - north:  ny ja  (), south:  y eoja  ()       [ edit ]   Morphophonemics   Grammatical morphemes may change shape depending on the preceding sounds. Examples include  -eun/-neun  (-/-) and  -i/-ga  (-/-). Sometimes sounds may be inserted instead. Examples include  -eul/-reul  (-/-),  -euro/-ro  (-/-),  -eseo/-seo  (-/-),  -ideunji/-deunji  (-/-) and  -iya/-ya  (-/-). However,  -euro/-ro  is somewhat irregular, since it will behave differently after a rieul consonant.     Korean particles     After a consonant   After a rieul   After a vowel       -ui  (-)       -eun  (-)   -neun  (-)       -i  (-)   -ga  (-)       -eul  (-)   -reul  (-)       -gwa  (-)   -wa  (-)       -euro  (-)   -ro  (-)       Some verbs may also change shape morphophonemically.     [ edit ]   Grammar       Main article:  Korean grammar         [ edit ]   Sentence structure   Korean is an  agglutinative language . Modifiers generally follow the modified word, and in the case of verb modifiers, can be serially appended. The basic form of a Korean sentence is  Subject Object Verb , but the verb is the only required and immovable element.       A :       -       -? (?)           gage-e     gasseo-yo           store + [location marker ()]     [go (verb root) ()]+[conjunctive ()]+[past ()]+[conjunctive ()]+ [interrogative marker ()]         ""Did [you] go to the store?"" (with ""you"" implied by context)         B :       .           ne           yes         ""Yes.""       [ edit ]   Parts of speech     [ edit ]   Verb   Korean  verbs  (  ,  dongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""action verbs"" or ""dynamic verbs"" to distinguish them from [  () ,  hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""]), which are also known as ""descriptive verbs"" or ""stative verbs"". Examples of action/dynamic verbs include    ( hada , ""to do, to have"") and    ( gada , ""to go"") which constitute an action or movement as opposed to descriptive verbs such as    ( yehppeuda , ""to be beautiful""). For a larger list of Korean verbs, see  wikt:Category:Korean verbs .   Unlike most of the European languages, Korean does not conjugate verbs using agreement with the subject, and nouns have no gender. Instead, verb conjugations depend upon the verb tense, aspect, mood, and the social relation between the speaker, the subjects, and the listeners. The system of speech levels and honorifics loosely resembles the  T-V distinction  of most  Indo-European languages . For example, different endings are used based on whether the subjects and listeners are friends, parents, or honoured persons.     [ edit ]   Adjective   Words categorized as Korean  adjectives  (  ,  hyeong-yongsa ,   ) conjugate similarly to verbs, so some English texts call them ""descriptive verbs"" or "" stative verbs "", but they are distinctly separate from    ( dongsa ).   English does not have an identical grammatical category, so the English translation of Korean adjectives may misleadingly suggest that they are verbs. For example,    ( bukda ) translates literally as ""to be red"" and    ( aswipda ) often best translates as ""to lack"" or ""to want for"", but both are    ( hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""). For a larger list of Korean adjectives, see  wikt:Category:Korean adjectives .     [ edit ]   Determiner   Korean  determiners  (  ,  gwanhyeongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""determinatives"", ""adnominals"", ""pre-nouns"", ""attributives"", and ""unconjugated adjectives"". Examples include    ( gak , ""each""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean determiners .     [ edit ]   Noun   A large body of Korean  nouns  (  ,  myeongsa ,   ) stem from  Chinese characters , e.g.    (,  san , mountain),    (,  yeok , station),    (,  munhwa , culture), etc. Others are native to the Korean language, e.g.    ( nara , country),    ( nal , day). Many  Sino-Korean words  have a native Korean equivalent and vice versa, but not always. Nouns do not have  grammatical gender  and can be made  plural  by adding  to the end of the word, however in most instances the  singular  form is used even when in English it would be translated as plural. For example, while in English the sentence  ""there are three apples""  would use the plural  ""apples""  instead of the singular  ""apple"" , the Korean sentence    ( sagwa segae isssumnida ) maintains the word  ( sagwa , ""apple"") in its singular form, thus rendered in English as ""apple three(things) exist."" For a list of Korean nouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean nouns .     [ edit ]   Pronoun       Main article:  Korean pronouns       Korean  pronouns  (  ,  daemyeongsa ,   ) are highly influenced by the honorifics in the language. Pronouns change forms depending on the social status of the person or persons spoken to, e.g. the pronoun for ""I"" there is both the informal    ( na ) and the honorific/humble    ( jeo ). In general second person singular pronouns are avoided, especially when using honorific forms. For a larger list or Korean pronouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean pronouns .     [ edit ]   Adverb   Korean  adverbs  (  ,  busa ,   ) include    ( tto , ""also"") and    ( gadeuk , ""fully""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean adverbs .     [ edit ]   Particle   Korean  particles  (  ,  josa ,   ) are also known in English as "" postpositions "". Examples include    ( neun , topic marker) and    ( reul , object marker). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean particles .     [ edit ]   Interjection   Korean  interjections  (  ,  gamtansa ,   ) are also known in English as ""exclamations"". Examples include    ( ani , ""no""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean interjections .     [ edit ]   Number       Main article:  Korean numerals       Korean  numbers  or numerals (  ,  sutja ,   ) consitute two regularly used sets: a native Korean set and a  Sino-Korean  set. The Sino-Korean system is nearly entirely based on the  Chinese numerals . The distinction between the two numeral systems is very important. Everything that can be counted will use one of the two systems, but seldom both. Sino-Korean words are sometimes used to mark ordinal usage: yeol beon ( ) means ""ten times"" while sip beon (() ()) means ""number ten."" The grouping of large numbers in Korean follow the Chinese tradition of myriads (10000) rather than thousands (1000) as is common in Europe and North America.     [ edit ]   Speech levels and honorifics       Main article:  Korean honorifics       The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean, and the grammar reflects this. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject referent is reflected in  honorifics , while that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in  speech level .     [ edit ]   Honorifics   When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a younger stranger, student, employee or the like. Nowadays, there are special endings which can be used on declarative, interrogative, and imperative sentences; and both honorific or normal sentences. They are made for easier and faster use of Korean.     [ edit ]   Speech levels   There are seven verb  paradigms  or  speech levels  in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation. [ citation needed ]  Unlike  honorifics   which are used to show respect towards the referent   speech levels  are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience. The names of the 7 levels are derived from the non-honorific  imperative  form of the verb    ( hada , ""do"") in each level, plus the suffix  ('che',  hanja :   ), which means ""style.""   The highest 6 levels are generally grouped together as  jondaenmal  (), while the lowest level ( haeche , ) is called  banmal  () in Korean.     [ edit ]   Vocabulary   The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words. Like Japanese and Vietnamese, more than 50% of the vocabulary (up to 60% by some estimates), especially words that denote abstract ideas, are  Sino-Korean words , [ 7 ]  either     directly borrowed from  Written Chinese , or   coined in Japan or Korea using  Chinese characters ,     in a similar way European languages borrow from Latin and Greek. Korean has two  number systems : one native, and one borrowed from Chinese.   To a much lesser extent, words have also occasionally been borrowed from  Mongolian ,  Sanskrit , and other languages. Conversely, the Korean language itself has also contributed some loanwords to other languages, most notably the  Tsushima dialect  of Japanese.   The vast majority of loanwords other than Sino-Korean come from modern times, 90% of which are from  English . [ 8 ]  Many words have also been borrowed from  Japanese  and  Western languages  such as  German  ( areubaiteu  part-time job,  allereugi  allergy). Some Western words were borrowed indirectly via Japanese, taking a Japanese sound pattern, for example dozen >     dsu  >     daseu . Most indirect Western borrowings are now written according to current Hangulization rules for the respective Western language, as if borrowed directly. There are a few more complicated borrowings such as German(y) (see  Names for Germany ), the first part of whose  endonym   [d.lant]  the Japanese approximated using the  kanji      doitsu  that were then accepted into the Korean language by their Sino-Korean pronunciation:     dok  +     il  =  Dogil . In South Korean official use, a number of other Sino-Korean country names have been replaced with phonetically oriented Hangulizations of the countries' endonyms or English names.   North Korean vocabulary shows a tendency to prefer native Korean over Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings, especially with recent political objectives aimed at eliminating foreign (mostly Chinese) influences on the Korean language in the North. By contrast, South Korean may have several Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings which tend to be absent in North Korean.     [ edit ]   Writing system       Korean writing systems           Hangul       Hanja       Hyangchal   Gugyeol   Idu       Mixed script       Korean romanization       Revised Romanization of Korean   McCune-Reischauer   Yale Romanization               Main article:  Hangul     See also:  Hangul consonant and vowel tables     In ancient times, the languages of the Korean peninsula were written using  Chinese characters , using  hyangchal  or  idu . Such systems were not popular because hanja is not well suited to the Korean language. Its use limited some cases and the aristocracy prefers  Classical Chinese  for its writing.   Korean is now mainly written in Hangul, the Korean alphabet promulgated in 1446 by  Sejong the Great ;  hanja may be mixed in  to write  Sino-Korean words . South Korea still teaches 1800 hanja characters in its schools, while the North abolished the use of hanja decades ago.   Below is a chart of the Korean alphabet's symbols and their canonical  IPA  values:     Consonants     Hangul                                                                        RR   b , p   d , t   j   g , k   pp   tt   jj   kk   p   t   ch   k   s   h   ss   m   n   ng       r , l           IPA   p   t      k   p   t      k   p   t      k   s   h   s   m   n      w   r   j         Vowels     Hangul                                                                      RR   i   e   oe   ae   a   o   u   eo   eu   ui   ye   yae   ya   yo   yu   yeo   wi   we   wae   wa   wo       IPA   i   e         a   o   u         i   je   j   ja   jo   ju   j   wi   we   w   wa   w       Modern Korean is written with  spaces  between  words , a feature not found in Chinese or Japanese. Korean  punctuation  marks are almost identical to Western ones. Traditionally, Korean was written in columns from top to bottom, right to left, but is now usually written in rows from left to right, top to bottom.     [ edit ]   Differences between North Korean and South Korean       Main article:  Korean language North-South differences       The Korean language used in the North and the South exhibits differences in pronunciation, spelling, grammar and vocabulary. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Pronunciation   In North Korea,  palatalization  of  /si/  is optional, and  //  can be pronounced as  [z]  in between vowels.   Words that are written the same way may be pronounced differently, such as the examples below. The pronunciations below are given in  Revised Romanization ,  McCune-Reischauer  and Hangul, the last of which represents what the Hangul would be if one writes the word as pronounced.       Word   Meaning   Pronunciation       North (RR/MR)   North (Hangul)   South (RR/MR)   South (Hangul)          wide   neo p tta (n p ta)      neo l tta (n l ta)             to read  (continuative form)   i l kko (i l ko)      i l kko (i l ko)             Amnok River   am r okgang (am r okkang)      am n okkang (am n okkang)             independence   dong r ip (tong r ip)      dong n ip (tong n ip)             idea / sense / conception   gwa ll yeom (kwa ll ym)      gwa nn yeom (kwa nn ym)          *   innovative   hyeoksin jj eok (hyksin tch k)      hyeoksin j eok (hyksin j k)          * Similar pronunciation is used in the North whenever the hanja """" is attached to a Sino-Korean word ending in ,  or . (In the South, this rule only applies when it is attached to any single-character Sino-Korean word.)     [ edit ]   Spelling   Some words are spelled differently by the North and the South, but the pronunciations are the same.       Word spelling   Meaning   Pronunciation (RR/MR)   Remarks       North   South             sunshine   haeppit (haepit)   The ""sai siot"" ('' used for indicating sound change) is almost never written out in the North.             cherry blossom   beotkkot (ptkkot)                cannot read   monnikda (monnikta)   Spacing.             Hallasan   hallasan (hallasan)   When a - combination is pronounced as  ll , the original Hangul spelling is kept in the North, while the Hangul is changed in the South.             rules   gyuyul (kyuyul)   In words where the original hanja is spelt """" or """" and follows a vowel, the initial  is not pronounced in the North, making the pronunciation identical with that in the South where the  is dropped in the spelling.         [ edit ]   Spelling and pronunciation   Some words have different spellings and pronunciations in the North and the South, some of which were given in the ""Phonology"" section above:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          ryeongryang (ryngryang)      yeongnyang (yngnyang)   strength   Korean words originally starting in  r  or  n  have their  r  or  n  dropped in the South Korean version if the sound following it is an  i  or  y  sound.          rodong (rodong)      nodong (nodong)   work   Korean words originally starting in  r  have their  r  changed to  n  in the South Korean version if the sound following it is a sound other than  i  or  y .          wonssu (wnssu)      wonsu (wnsu)   mortal enemy   ""Mortal enemy"" and ""head of state"" are homophones in the South. Possibly to avoid referring to  Kim Il-sung  /  Kim Jong-il  as the enemy, the second syllable of ""enemy"" is written and pronounced  in the North.          rajio (rajio)      radio (radio)   radio            u (u)      wi (wi)   on; above            anhae (anhae)      anae (anae)   wife            kkuba (kkuba)      kuba (k'uba)   Cuba   When transcribing foreign words from languages that do not have contrasts between aspirated and unaspirated stops, North Koreans generally use tensed stops for the unaspirated ones while South Koreans use aspirated stops in both cases.          pe (p'e)      pye (p'ye), pe (p'e)   lungs   All hanja pronounced as  pye  ( p'ye ) or  pe  ( p'e ) in the South are pronounced as  pe  ( p'e ) in the North. The spelling is also accordingly different.       In general, when transcribing place names, North Korea tends to use the pronunciation in the original language more than South Korea, which often uses the pronunciation in English. For example:       Original name   North Korea transliteration   English name   South Korea transliteration       Spelling   Pronunciation   Spelling   Pronunciaton       Ulaanbaatar      ullanbattareu (ullanbattar)   Ulan Bator      ullanbatoreu (ullanbat'or)       Kbenhavn      koeppenhabeun (k'oeppenhabn)   Copenhagen      kopenhagen (k'op'enhagen)       al-Qhirah      kkahira (kkahira)   Cairo      kairo (k'airo)         [ edit ]   Grammar   Some grammatical constructions are also different:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          doeyeotda (toeytta)      doeeotda (toetta)   past tense of  (doeda/toeda), ""to become""   All similar grammar forms of verbs or adjectives that end in  in the stem (i.e. , , , ,  and ) in the North use  instead of the South's .          gomawayo (komawayo)      gomawoyo (komawyo)   thanks   -irregular verbs in the North use  (wa) for all those with a positive ending vowel; this only happens in the South if the verb stem has only one syllable.          halgayo (halkayo)      halkkayo (halkkayo)   Shall we do?   Although the Hangul differ, the pronunciations are the same (i.e. with the tensed  sound).         [ edit ]   Vocabulary   Some vocabulary is different between the North and the South:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          munhwajutaek (munhwajut'aek)      apateu (ap'at')   Apartment     (appateu/appat') is also used in the North.          joseonmal (chosnmal)      han-gugeo(han'gugeo)   Korean language            gwakbap (kwakpap)      dosirak (tosirak)   lunch box           [ edit ]   Others   In the North,  guillemets     and    are the symbols used for quotes; in the South, quotation marks equivalent to the English ones,  and , are standard, although     and     are sometimes used in popular novels.     [ edit ]   Study by non-native speakers   The  United States '  Defense Language Institute  classifies Korean alongside  Arabic ,  Chinese , and  Japanese  as a Category IV language, meaning that 63 weeks of instruction (as compared to just 25 weeks for  French ,  Spanish ,  Portuguese , and  Italian ) are required to bring an English-speaking student to a limited working level of proficiency in which he or she has ""sufficient capability to meet routine social demands and limited job requirements"" and ""can deal with concrete topics in past, present, and future tense."" [ 10 ]  As a result, the study of the Korean language in the United States is dominated by  Korean American  heritage language students; they are estimated to form over 80% of all students of the language at non-military universities. [ 11 ]   However, Korean is considerably easier for speakers of certain other languages, such as Japanese, Mongolian and Turkic languages; in Japan, it is more widely studied by non-heritage learners. [ 12 ]  The  Korean Language Proficiency Test , an examination aimed at assessing non-native speakers' competence in Korean, was instituted in 1997; 17,000 people applied for the 2005 sitting of the examination.

This article is mainly about the spoken Korean language. See  Hangul  for details on the native Korean writing system.     Korean  ( \m / p  , see  below ) is the official  language  of both  North Korea  and  South Korea . It is also one of the two official languages in the  Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture  in  China . There are about 80 million Korean speakers, with large groups in  Australia ,  Brazil ,  Canada ,  China ,  Japan , the  United States ,  Post-Soviet states , and more recently the  Philippines .   The genealogical  classification  of the Korean language is debated. Some linguists place it in the  Altaic  language family, while others consider it to be a  language isolate . It is  agglutinative  in its morphology and  SOV  in its  syntax . Like the  Japanese  and  Vietnamese  languages, Korean language was influenced by the  Chinese language  in the form of  Sino-Korean  words. Native Korean words account for about 35% of the Korean vocabulary, while about 60% of the Korean vocabulary consists of Sino-Korean words. The remaining 5% comes from loan words from other languages, 90% of which are from  English .

In North Korea and Yanbian in China, the language is most often called  ChosOnmal  ( p  ; with  Hanja :   ), or more formally,  ChosOnO  ( p  ;   ).   In the Republic of Korea, the language is most often called  Hangungmal  ( \m ;   ), or more formally,  Hangugeo  ( \m ;   ) or  Gugeo  ( m ;   ; literally ""national language""). It is sometimes colloquially called  urimal  (""our language"";    in one word in South Korea,       with a space in North Korea).   On the other hand, Korean people in the  former USSR , who refer to themselves as  Koryo-saram  (also  Goryeoin  [ $x ;  ؗ ; literally, "" Goryeo  person(s)""]) call the language  Goryeomal  ( $ ;  ؗ ).       The classification of the modern Korean language is uncertain, and due to the lack of any one generally accepted theory, it is sometimes described conservatively as a  language isolate .   Since the publication of the article of  Ramstedt  in 1926, many linguists support the hypothesis that Korean can be classified as an  Altaic  language, or as a relative of proto-Altaic. Korean is similar to Altaic languages in that they both lack certain grammatical elements, including  number ,  gender ,  articles , fusional morphology, voice, and  relative pronouns  (Kim Namkil). Korean especially bears some  morphological  resemblance to some languages of the Eastern Turkic group, namely  Sakha (Yakut) . Vinokurova, a scholar of the Sakha language, noted that like in Korean, and unlike in other  Turkic languages  or a variety of other languages surveyed, adverbs in Sakha are derived from verbs with the help of derivational morphology; however, she did not suggest this implied any relation between the two languages. [3]   It is also considered likely that Korean is related in some way to  Japanese , since the two languages have a similar grammatical structure. Genetic relationships have been postulated both directly and indirectly, the latter either through placing both languages in the Altaic family, or by arguing for a relationship between Japanese and the  Buyeo languages  of  Goguryeo  and  Baekje  (see below); the proposed Baekje relationship is supported by cognates such as Baekje  mir , Japanese  mi-  ""three"". [4]   Others argue, however, that the similarities are not due to any genetic relationship, but rather to a  sprachbund  effect. See  East Asian languages  for morphological features shared among languages of the East Asian  sprachbund , and  Japanese language classification  for further details on the possible relationship.   Of the ancient languages attested in the Korean Peninsula, modern Korean is believed to be a descendent of the languages of  Samhan  and  Silla ; it is unknown whether these are related to the Buyeo languages, though many Korean scholars believe they were mutually intelligible, and the collective basis of what in the  Goryeo  period would merge to become Middle Korean (the language before the changes that the  Seven-Year War  brought) and eventually Modern Korean. The  Jeju dialect  preserves some archaic features that can also be found in Middle Korean, whose  arae a  is retained in the dialect as a distinct vowel.   There are also fringe theories proposing various other relationships; for example, a few linguists such as Homer B. Hulbert have also tried to relate Korean to the  Dravidian languages  through the similar syntax in both. [5]           Main article:  Korean dialects              Dialects of Korean       Korean has several  dialects  (called  mal  [literally ""speech""],  saturi , or  bang-eon  in Korean). The  standard language  ( pyojuneo  or  pyojunmal ) of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  P'yOngyang . These dialects are similar, and are in fact all mutually intelligible, perhaps with the exception of the dialect of  Jeju  Island (see  Jeju Dialect ). The dialect spoken in  Jeju  is in fact classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of  Seoul dialect  use very little stress, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of the  Gyeongsang dialect  have a very pronounced intonation.   It is also worth noting that there is substantial evidence for a history of extensive  dialect levelling , or even  convergent evolution  or intermixture of two or more originally distinct linguistic stocks, within the Korean language and its dialects. Many Korean dialects have basic vocabulary that is etymologically distinct from vocabulary of identical meaning in Standard Korean or other dialects, such as South Jeolla dialect /kur/ vs. Standard Korean  /ip/  ""mouth"" or Gyeongsang dialect  /K.gu.i/  vs. Standard Korean  /puШu/  "" garlic chives ."" This suggests that the Korean Peninsula may have at one time been much more linguistically diverse than it is at present. [ citation needed ]  See also the  Buyeo languages   hypothesis .   There is a very close connection between the dialects of Korean and the  regions of Korea , since the boundaries of both are largely determined by mountains and seas.

Its official use in the  Extended IPA  is for  'strong'  articulation, but is used in the literature for  faucalized voice . The Korean consonants also have elements of  stiff voice , but it is not yet known how typical this is of faucalized consonants. They are produced with a partially constricted  glottis  and additional subglottal pressure in addition to tense vocal tract walls, laryngeal lowering, or other expansion of the larynx.                        The Korean vowels                 Monophthongs   /i/  c , /e/  T , /[/  P , /a/  O , /o/  W , /u/  \ , //  S , /o/  a , //  Z       Vowels preceded by intermediaries,  or Diphthongs   /je/  V , /j[/  R , /ja/  Q , /wi/  _ , /we/  ^ , /w[/  Y , /wa/  X , /oi/  b , /jo/  [ , /ju/  ` , /j/  U , /w/  ]           /s/  becomes an  alveolo-palatal   [U]  before  [j]  or  [i]  for most speakers (but see  Differences in the language between North Korea and South Korea ). This occurs with the tense fricative and all the affricates as well. At the end of a syllable, /s/ changes to /t/ (Example: beoseot (/) 'mushroom').   /h/  may become a  bilabial   [x]  before  [o]  or  [u] , a  palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i] , a  velar   [x]  before  [o] , a voiced  [f]  between voiced sounds, and a  [h]  elsewhere. [ citation needed ]   /p, t, , k/  become voiced  [b, d, , g]  between voiced sounds.   /l/  becomes alveolar flap  [~]  between vowels, and  [l]  or  [m]  at the end of a syllable or next to another  /l/ . Note that a written syllable-final '9', when followed by a vowel or a glide ( i.e. , when the next character starts with 'G'), migrates to the next syllable and thus becomes  [~] .   Traditionally,  /l/  was disallowed at the beginning of a word. It disappeared before  [j] , and otherwise became  /n/ . However, the inflow of western loanword changed the trend, and now word-initial  /l/  (mostly from English loanwords) are pronounced as a free variation of either  [~]  or  [l] . The traditional prohibition of word-initial  /l/  became a morphological rule called ""initial law"" (PLY) in South Korea, which pertains to Sino-Korean vocabulary. Such words retain their word-initial  /l/  in North Korea.   All  obstruents  (plosives, affricates, fricatives) are  unreleased   [p, t, k]  at the end of a word.   Plosive stops  /p, t, k/  become nasal stops  [m, n, K]  before nasal stops.   Hangul  spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying  morphology .   One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial  [r] , and initial  [n] . For example,     ""labour"" - north:  r odong  (\), south:  n odong  (x)   ""history"" - north:  ry Oksa  (%), south:  y eoksa  ()   ""female"" - north:  ny Oja  (@), south:  y eoja  ()             Korean is an  agglutinative language . Modifiers precede the modified word. The basic form of a Korean sentence is  Subject Object Verb , but the verb is the only required and immovable element.     A : "" 8?"" ""  (gage-e gaseyo?)   B : ""$.""  (ne.)     Literal translation :     A : *""store () + to() + go() +[polite interrogative marker]?""?""   B : ""Yes.""     English equivalent :     A : ""Going to the store?""   B : ""Yes.""             Korean  verbs  ( ٬ ,  dongsa ,  ^ ) are also known in English as ""action verbs"" or ""dynamic verbs"" to distinguish them from (  ,  hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""), which are also known as ""descriptive verbs"" or ""stative verbs"".   Examples include  X  ( hada , ""to do, to have"") and    ( gada , ""to go""). For a larger list of Korean verbs, see  wikt:Category:Korean verbs .   Unlike most European languages, Korean does not conjugate verbs using agreement with the subject, and nouns have no gender. Instead, verb conjugations depend upon the verb tense, aspect, mood, and the social relation between the speaker, the subjects, and the listeners. The system of speech levels and honorifics loosely resembles the  T-V distinction  of most  Indo-European languages . For example, different endings are used based on whether the subjects and listeners are friends, parents, or honoured persons.       Words categorized as Korean  adjectives  (  ,  hyeong-yongsa ,  b^ ) conjugate similarly to verbs, so some English texts call them ""descriptive verbs"" or "" stative verbs "", but they are distinctly separate from  ٬  ( dongsa ).   English does not have an identical grammatical category, so the English translation of Korean adjectives may misleadingly suggest that they are verbs. For example,    ( bukda ) translates literally as ""to be red"" and  D}  ( aswipda ) often best translates as ""to lack"" or ""to want for"", but both are    ( hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""). For a larger list of Korean adjectives, see  wikt:Category:Korean adjectives .       Korean  determiners  (  ,  gwanhyeongsa ) are also known in English as ""determinatives"", ""adnominals"", ""pre-nouns"", ""attributives"", and ""unconjugated adjectives"". Examples include    ( gak , ""each"") and    ( neurin ,""slow""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean determiners .       Korean  nouns  (  ,  myeongsa ) are also known in English as ""substantives"". Examples include  qq  ( gajok , ""household"") and    ( mat , ""flavor""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean nouns .       Korean  pronouns  (  ,  daemyeongsa ) include    ( na , ""I"") and    ( geu ). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean pronouns .

Main article:  Korean honorifics       The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean, and the grammar reflects this. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject referent is reflected in  honorifics , while that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in  speech level .       When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a younger stranger, student, employee or the like.       There are no fewer than 7 verb  paradigms  or  speech levels  in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation. Unlike ""honorifics""  which are used to show respect towards the referent of a subject   speech levels  are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience. The names of the 7 levels are derived from the non-honorific  imperative  form of the verb X ( hada , ""do"") in each level, plus the suffix  ('che',  Hanja :   ), which means ""style.""   The highest 5 levels are generally grouped together as  jondaemal  (t), while the lowest 2 levels (( haeche , t) are called  banmal  () in Korean.       The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words. More than 50% of the vocabulary (up to 70% by some estimates), however, especially scholarly terminology, are  Sino-Korean  words [ citation needed ] , either     directly borrowed from  Written Chinese , or   coined in Japan or Korea using  Chinese characters .     Korean has two  number systems : one native, and one borrowed from the Chinese.   To a much lesser extent, words have also occasionally been borrowed from  Mongolian ,  Sanskrit , and other languages. Conversely, the Korean language itself has also contributed some loanwords to other languages, most notably the  Tsushima dialect  of Japanese.   In modern times, many words have been borrowed from  Japanese  and  Western languages  such as  German  ( areubaiteu  part-time job,  allereugi  allergy) and more recently  English . Concerning daily usage vocabulary except what can be written in hanja, more words have possibly been borrowed from English than from any other language. Some Western words were borrowed indirectly via Japanese, taking a Japanese sound pattern, for example dozen >     dsu  >     daseu . Most indirect Western borrowings are now written according to current hangulization rules for the respective Western language, as if borrowed directly. There are a few more complicated borrowings such as German(y) (see  Names for Germany ), the first part of whose  endonym   [d%Tj/.la nt]  the Japanese approximated using the  kanji   h8   doitsu  that were then accepted into the Korean language by their Sino-Korean pronunciation:  h   dok  +  8   il  =  Dogil . In South Korean official use, a number of other Sino-Korean country names have been replaced with phonetically oriented hangulizations of the countries' endonyms or English names.   North Korean vocabulary shows a tendency to prefer native Korean over Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings, especially with recent political objectives aimed at eliminating foreign (mostly Chinese) influences on the Korean language in the North. By contrast, South Korean may have several Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings which tend to be absent in North Korean.

Knowledge of such systems were lost, and the Korean language was not written at all; the aristocracy used  Classical Chinese  for its writing.   Korean is now mainly written in  Hangul , the Korean alphabet, optionally  mixing in Hanja  to write  Sino-Korean  words. South Korea still teaches 1800 Hanja characters in its schools, while the North abolished the use of hanja decades ago.

In South Korea, the language is most often called  Hangungmal  (  ;   ), or more formally,  Hangugeo  (  ;   ) or  Gugeo  (  ;   ; literally ""national language"").   In North Korea and Yanbian in China, the language is most often called  Chosnmal  (  ; with  hanja :   ), or more formally,  Chosn  (  ;   ).   On the other hand, Korean people in the  former USSR , who refer to themselves as  Koryo-saram  (also  Goryeoin  [  ;   ; literally, "" Goryeo  person(s)""]) call the language  Goryeomal  (  ;   ).   In  mainland China , following the establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992, the term  Choxiny  (   or short form:  Choy  (  )) has normally been used to refer to the language spoken in North Korea and Yanbian, while  Hnguy  (   or short form:  Hny  (  )) is used to refer to the language spoken in South Korea.   Some older English sources also used the name ""Korean"" to refer to the language, country, and people.     [ edit ]   History   Main article:  History of the Korean language   Korean is descended from  Old Korean  and  Middle Korean .     [ edit ]   Classification   The classification of the modern Korean language is uncertain, and due to the lack of any one generally accepted theory, it is sometimes described conservatively as a  language isolate .   On the other hand, since the publication of the article of  Ramstedt  in 1926, many linguists support the hypothesis that Korean can be classified as an  Altaic  language, or as a relative of proto-Altaic. Korean is similar to Altaic languages in that they both lack certain grammatical elements, including  number ,  gender ,  articles , fusional morphology, voice, and  relative pronouns  (Kim Namkil). Korean especially bears some  morphological  resemblance to some languages of the Northern Turkic group, namely  Sakha (Yakut) . Vinokurova, a scholar of the Sakha language, noted that like in Korean, and unlike in other  Turkic languages  or a variety of other languages surveyed, adverbs in Sakha are derived from verbs with the help of derivational morphology; however, she did not suggest this implied any relation between the two languages. [ 2 ]   It is also considered likely that Korean is related in some way to  Japanese , since the two languages have nearly identical grammatical structures, and share a number of possible phonological cognates (though a majority of them are likely due to local pronunciations of the Chinese characters from which they are derived), as noted by such researchers as  Samuel E. Martin  and  Roy Andrew Miller  in the late 1960s.  Sergei Starostin  (1991) found about 25% of potential cognates in the Japanese-Korean 100-word  Swadesh list , which places these two languages closer together than other possible members of the Altaic family. [ 3 ]   Genetic relationships have been postulated both directly and indirectly, the latter either through placing both languages in the Altaic family, or by arguing for a relationship between Japanese and the  Buyeo languages  of  Goguryeo  and  Baekje  (see below); the proposed Baekje relationship is supported by cognates such as Baekje  mir , Japanese  mi-  ""three"". [ 4 ]   The possible relationship between Korean and Japanese can be exemplified by such basic vocabularly items as J.     mizu  (Old J.  midu ) : K.     mul  (Middle K.  mirh ) ""water"",  mot  ""lake""; J.     ku-ru  ""come"" (Old J.  ku , also cf. irregular root changes as in past tense   ki-ta , negative   ko-nai  in Modern J.) : K.     ka-da  (""go""); J.     kata-i  ""hard"" (whence     kata-na  ""knife, sword"") : K.  kud-yn  (hard); J.     i-ru  ""to be"" (past tense   i-ta ) : K.     i-da  ""to be""; J.  na ,  -en  : K.  anh  ""not"", J.  minna  (Old J.  mynna ) ""all, everyone"" : K.  manh-  ""many"" (predicate  mana-da ), etc.  [ 5 ] . The same possible cognates are often observed in other members of the potential  Altaic family , esp. in the  Tungusic languages . Cf. Nanay  mue  ""water"",  giagda-  ""to walk"",  anaa, anna  ""not"".   Others argue, however, that the similarities are not due to any genetic relationship, but rather to a  sprachbund  effect. [ citation needed ]  See  East Asian languages  for morphological features shared among languages of the East Asian  sprachbund , and  Classification of Japanese  for further details on the possible relationship. Though it is very difficult to believe words such as ""water"", ""to be"", and ""to go"" arise from sprachbund effects.   It is presumed that modern Korean may be more closely related to the languages of  Samhan  and  Silla  than the Buyeo languages; many Korean scholars believe they were mutually intelligible, and the collective basis of what in the  Goryeo  period would merge to become Middle Korean (the language before the changes that the  Seven-Year War  brought) and eventually Modern Korean. The  Jeju dialect  preserves some archaic features that can also be found in Middle Korean, whose  arae a  is retained in the dialect as a distinct vowel.   There are also more marginal hypotheses proposing various other relationships; for example, a few scholars, such as  Homer B. Hulbert  (1905), have tried to relate Korean to the  Dravidian languages  through the similar syntax in both. [ 6 ]   Though not related to Chinese, it has borrowed heavily; see the Vocabulary section below.     [ edit ]   Dialects   Main article:  Korean dialects          Dialects of Korean       Korean has several  dialects  (called  mal  [literally ""speech""],  saturi , or  bang-eon  in Korean). The  standard language  ( pyojuneo  or  pyojunmal ) of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  P'yngyang . All dialects of Korean are similar to each other, and are in fact all mutually intelligible, perhaps with the exception of the dialect of  Jeju Island  (see  Jeju dialect ). The dialect spoken in Jeju is in fact classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of  Seoul dialect  use very little stress, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of the  Gyeongsang dialect  have a very pronounced intonation.   It is also worth noting that there is substantial evidence for a history of extensive  dialect levelling , or even  convergent evolution  or intermixture of two or more originally distinct linguistic stocks, within the Korean language and its dialects. Many Korean dialects have basic vocabulary that is etymologically distinct from vocabulary of identical meaning in Standard Korean or other dialects, such as South Jeolla dialect /kur/ vs. Standard Korean     /ip/  ""mouth"" or Gyeongsang dialect  /.u.i/  vs. Standard Korean  /puu/  "" garlic chives ."" This suggests that the Korean Peninsula may have at one time been much more linguistically diverse than it is at present. See also the  Buyeo languages   hypothesis .   There is a very close connection between the dialects of Korean and the  regions of Korea , since the boundaries of both are largely determined by mountains and seas. Here is a list of traditional dialect names and locations:       Standard dialect   Where used       Seoul   Seoul  (),  Incheon  (/), most of  Gyeonggi  (/)       P'yngan  (/)   P'yngyang ,  P'yngan  region,  Chagang  (North Korea)       Regional dialect   Where used       Gyeonggi   limited areas of the  Gyeonggi  region (South Korea)       Chungcheong   Daejeon ,  Chungcheong  region (South Korea)       Gangwon   Gangwon-do (South Korea) / Kangwn (North Korea)       Gyeongsang   Busan ,  Daegu ,  Ulsan ,  Gyeongsang  region (South Korea)       Hamgyng   Rasn ,  Hamgyng  region,  Ryanggang  (North Korea)       Hwanghae   Hwanghae  region (North Korea)       Jeju   Jeju Island/Province  (South Korea)       Jeolla   Gwangju ,  Jeolla  region (South Korea)         [ edit ]   Phonology       This article contains  IPA  phonetic symbols.

Its official use in the  Extensions to the IPA  is for  'strong'  articulation, but is used in the literature for  faucalized voice . The Korean consonants also have elements of  stiff voice , but it is not yet known how typical this is of faucalized consonants. They are produced with a partially constricted  glottis  and additional subglottal pressure in addition to tense vocal tract walls, laryngeal lowering, or other expansion of the larynx.     [ edit ]   Vowels                    The Korean basic vowels                 Monophthongs   /i/    ,  /e/    ,  //    ,  /a/    ,  /o/    ,  /u/    ,  //    ,  //    ,  //          Vowels preceded by intermediaries,  or Diphthongs   /je/    ,  /j/    ,  /ja/    ,  /wi/    ,  /we/    ,  /w/    ,  /wa/    ,  /i/    ,  /jo/    ,  /ju/    ,  /j/    ,  /w/            [ edit ]   Allophones   /s/  becomes an  alveolo-palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i]  for most speakers (but see  Differences in the language between North Korea and South Korea ). This occurs with the tense fricative and all the affricates as well. At the end of a syllable, /s/ changes to /t/ (Example: beoseot () 'mushroom').   /h/  may become a  bilabial   []  before  [o]  or  [u] , a  palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i] , a  velar   [x]  before  [] , a voiced  []  between voiced sounds, and a  [h]  elsewhere. [ citation needed ]   /p, t, , k/  become voiced  [b, d, , ]  between voiced sounds.   /l/  becomes alveolar flap  []  between vowels, and  [l]  or  []  at the end of a syllable or next to another  /l/ . Note that a written syllable-final '', when followed by a vowel or a glide ( i.e. , when the next character starts with ''), migrates to the next syllable and thus becomes  [] .   Traditionally,  /l/  was disallowed at the beginning of a word. It disappeared before  [j] , and otherwise became  /n/ . However, the inflow of western loanword changed the trend, and now word-initial  /l/  (mostly from English loanwords) are pronounced as a free variation of either  []  or  [l] . The traditional prohibition of word-initial  /l/  became a morphological rule called ""initial law"" () in South Korea, which pertains to Sino-Korean vocabulary. Such words retain their word-initial  /l/  in North Korea.   All  obstruents  (plosives, affricates, fricatives) are  unreleased   [p, t, k]  at the end of a word.   Plosive stops  /p, t, k/  become nasal stops  [m, n, ]  before nasal stops.   Hangul  spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying, partly historical  morphology . Given this, it is sometimes hard to tell which actual phonemes are present in a certain word.   One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial  [r] , and initial  [n] . For example,     ""labour"" - north:  r odong  (), south:  n odong  ()   ""history"" - north:  ry ksa  (), south:  y eoksa  ()   ""female"" - north:  ny ja  (), south:  y eoja  ()       [ edit ]   Morphophonemics   Grammatical morphemes may change shape depending on the preceding sounds. Examples include  -eun/-neun  (-/-) and  -i/-ga  (-/-). Sometimes sounds may be inserted instead. Examples include  -eul/-reul  (-/-),  -euro/-ro  (-/-),  -eseo/-seo  (-/-),  -ideunji/-deunji  (-/-) and  -iya/-ya  (-/-). However,  -euro/-ro  is somewhat irregular, since it will behave differently after a rieul consonant.     Korean particles     After a consonant   After a rieul   After a vowel       -ui  (-)       -eun  (-)   -neun  (-)       -i  (-)   -ga  (-)       -eul  (-)   -reul  (-)       -gwa  (-)   -wa  (-)       -euro  (-)   -ro  (-)       Some verbs may also change shape morphophonemically.     [ edit ]   Grammar   Main article:  Korean grammar     [ edit ]   Sentence structure   Korean is an  agglutinative language . Modifiers generally follow the modified word, and in the case of verb modifiers, can be serially appended. The basic form of a Korean sentence is  Subject Object Verb , but the verb is the only required and immovable element.       A :       -       -? (?)           kage-e     kasseo-yo           store + [location marker ()]     [go (verb root) ()]+[conjunctive ()]+[past ()]+[conjunctive ()]+ [polite marker ()]         ""Did [you] go to the store?"" (with ""you"" implied by context)         B :       .           ye           yes         ""Yes.""       [ edit ]   Parts of speech     [ edit ]   Verb   Korean  verbs  (  ,  tongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""action verbs"" or ""dynamic verbs"" to distinguish them from [  () ,  hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""]), which are also known as ""descriptive verbs"" or ""stative verbs"". Examples of action/dynamic verbs include    ( hada , ""to do"") and    ( kada , ""to go"") which constitute an action or movement as opposed to descriptive verbs such as    ( yehppeuda , ""to be beautiful""). For a larger list of Korean verbs, see  wikt:Category:Korean verbs .   Unlike most of the European languages, Korean does not conjugate verbs using agreement with the subject, and nouns have no gender. Instead, verb conjugations depend upon the verb tense, aspect, mood, and the social relation between the speaker, the subjects, and the listeners. The system of speech levels and honorifics loosely resembles the  T-V distinction  of most  Indo-European languages . For example, different endings are used based on the speaker's relation with the person they are talking to or the person about which they are talking. Politeness is a critical part of Korean language and Korean culture, therefore, when talking to someone esteemed, the correct verb ending, which should have a lot of respect, must be chosen.     [ edit ]   Adjective   Words categorized as Korean  adjectives  (  ,  hyeong-yongsa ,   ) conjugate similarly to verbs, so some English texts call them ""descriptive verbs"" or "" stative verbs "", but they are distinctly separate from    ( tongsa ).   English does not have an identical grammatical category, so the English translation of Korean adjectives may misleadingly suggest that they are verbs. For example,    ( pukda ) translates literally as ""to be red"" and    ( aswipda ) often best translates as ""to lack"" or ""to want for"", but both are    ( hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""). For a larger list of Korean adjectives, see  wikt:Category:Korean adjectives .     [ edit ]   Determiner   Korean  determiners  (  ,  gwanhyeongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""determinatives"", ""adnominals"", ""pre-nouns"", ""attributives"", and ""unconjugated adjectives"". Examples include    ( kak , ""each""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean determiners .     [ edit ]   Noun   A large body of Korean  nouns  (  ,  myeongsa ,   ) stem from  Chinese characters , e.g.    (,  san , mountain),    (,  yeok , station),    (,  munhwa , culture), etc. Others are native to the Korean language, e.g.    ( nara , country),    ( nal , day). Many  Sino-Korean words  have a native Korean equivalent and vice versa, but not always. Nouns do not have  grammatical gender  and can be made  plural  by adding  to the end of the word, however in most instances the  singular  form is used even when in English it would be translated as plural. For example, while in English the sentence  ""there are three apples""  would use the plural  ""apples""  instead of the singular  ""apple"" , the Korean sentence    ( sagwa segae isssumnida ) maintains the word  ( sagwa , ""apple"") in its singular form, thus rendered in English as ""apple three(things) exist."" For a list of Korean nouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean nouns .     [ edit ]   Pronoun   Main article:  Korean pronouns   Korean  pronouns  (  ,  daemyeongsa ,   ) are highly influenced by the honorifics in the language. Pronouns change forms depending on the social status of the person or persons spoken to, e.g. the pronoun for ""I"" there is both the informal    ( na ) and the honorific/humble    ( jeo ). In general second person singular pronouns are avoided, especially when using honorific forms. For a larger list or Korean pronouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean pronouns .     [ edit ]   Adverb   Korean  adverbs  (  ,  busa ,   ) include    ( tto , ""also"") and    ( gadeuk , ""fully""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean adverbs .     [ edit ]   Particle   Korean  particles  (  ,  josa ,   ) are also known in English as "" postpositions "". Examples include    ( neun , topic marker) and    ( reul , object marker). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean particles .     [ edit ]   Interjection   Korean  interjections  (  ,  gamtansa ,   ) are also known in English as ""exclamations"". Examples include    ( ani , ""no""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean interjections .     [ edit ]   Number   Main article:  Korean numerals   Korean  numbers  or numerals (  ,  sutja ,   ) consitute two regularly used sets: a native Korean set and a  Sino-Korean  set. The Sino-Korean system is nearly entirely based on the  Chinese numerals . The distinction between the two numeral systems is very important. Everything that can be counted will use one of the two systems, but seldom both. Sino-Korean words are sometimes used to mark ordinal usage: yeol beon ( ) means ""ten times"" while sip beon (() ()) means ""number ten."" The grouping of large numbers in Korean follow the Chinese tradition of myriads (10000) rather than thousands (1000) as is common in Europe and North America.     [ edit ]   Speech levels and honorifics   Main article:  Korean honorifics   The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean, and the grammar reflects this. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject referent is reflected in  honorifics , while that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in  speech level .     [ edit ]   Honorifics   When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a younger stranger, student, employee or the like. Nowadays, there are special endings which can be used on declarative, interrogative, and imperative sentences; and both honorific or normal sentences. They are made for easier and faster use of Korean.     [ edit ]   Speech levels   There are seven verb  paradigms  or  speech levels  in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation. [ citation needed ]  Unlike  honorifics   which are used to show respect towards the referent   speech levels  are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience. The names of the 7 levels are derived from the non-honorific  imperative  form of the verb    ( hada , ""do"") in each level, plus the suffix  ('che',  hanja :   ), which means ""style.""   The highest 6 levels are generally grouped together as  jondaenmal  (), while the lowest level ( haeche , ) is called  banmal  () in Korean.     [ edit ]   Vocabulary   The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words. Like Japanese and Vietnamese, more than 50% of the vocabulary (up to 60% by some estimates), especially words that denote abstract ideas, are  Sino-Korean words , [ 7 ]  either     directly borrowed from  Written Chinese , or   coined in Japan or Korea using  Chinese characters ,     in a similar way European languages borrow from Latin and Greek. Korean has two  number systems : one native, and one borrowed from Chinese.   To a much lesser extent, words have also occasionally been borrowed from  Mongolian ,  Sanskrit , and other languages. Conversely, the Korean language itself has also contributed some loanwords to other languages, most notably the  Tsushima dialect  of Japanese.   The vast majority of loanwords other than Sino-Korean come from modern times, 90% of which are from  English . [ 8 ]  Many words have also been borrowed from  Japanese  and  Western languages  such as  German  ( areubaiteu  part-time job,  allereugi  allergy). Some Western words were borrowed indirectly via Japanese, taking a Japanese sound pattern, for example dozen >     dsu  >     daseu . Most indirect Western borrowings are now written according to current Hangulization rules for the respective Western language, as if borrowed directly. There are a few more complicated borrowings such as German(y) (see  Names for Germany ), the first part of whose  endonym   [d.lant]  the Japanese approximated using the  kanji      doitsu  that were then accepted into the Korean language by their Sino-Korean pronunciation:     dok  +     il  =  Dogil . In South Korean official use, a number of other Sino-Korean country names have been replaced with phonetically oriented Hangulizations of the countries' endonyms or English names.   North Korean vocabulary shows a tendency to prefer native Korean over Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings, especially with recent political objectives aimed at eliminating foreign (mostly Chinese) influences on the Korean language in the North. By contrast, South Korean may have several Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings which tend to be absent in North Korean.     [ edit ]   Writing system       Korean writing systems           Hangul       Hanja       Hyangchal   Gugyeol   Idu       Mixed script       Korean romanization       Revised Romanization of Korean   McCune-Reischauer   Yale Romanization           Main article:  Hangul   See also:  Hangul consonant and vowel tables   In ancient times, the languages of the Korean peninsula were written using  Chinese characters , using  hyangchal  or  idu . Such systems were not popular because hanja is not well suited to the Korean language. Its use is now limited.   Korean is now mainly written in Hangul, the Korean alphabet promulgated in 1446 by  Sejong the Great ;  hanja may be mixed in  to write  Sino-Korean words . South Korea still teaches 1800 hanja characters in its schools, while the North abolished the use of hanja decades ago.   Below is a chart of the Korean alphabet's symbols and their canonical  IPA  values:     Consonants     Hangul                                                                        RR   b , p   d , t   j   g , k   pp   tt   jj   kk   p   t   ch   k   s   h   ss   m   n   ng       r , l           IPA   p   t      k   p   t      k   p   t      k   s   h   s   m   n      w   r   j         Vowels     Hangul                                                                      RR   i   e   oe   ae   a   o   u   eo   eu   ui   ye   yae   ya   yo   yu   yeo   wi   we   wae   wa   wo       IPA   i   e         a   o   u         i   je   j   ja   jo   ju   j   wi   we   w   wa   w       Modern Korean is written with  spaces  between  words , a feature not found in Chinese or Japanese. Korean  punctuation  marks are almost identical to Western ones. Traditionally, Korean was written in columns from top to bottom, right to left, but is now usually written in rows from left to right, top to bottom.     [ edit ]   Differences between North Korean and South Korean   Main article:  Korean language North-South differences   The Korean language used in the North and the South exhibits differences in pronunciation, spelling, grammar and vocabulary. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Pronunciation   In North Korea,  palatalization  of  /si/  is optional, and  //  can be pronounced as  [z]  in between vowels.   Words that are written the same way may be pronounced differently, such as the examples below. The pronunciations below are given in  Revised Romanization ,  McCune-Reischauer  and Hangul, the last of which represents what the Hangul would be if one writes the word as pronounced.       Word   Meaning   Pronunciation       North (RR/MR)   North (Hangul)   South (RR/MR)   South (Hangul)          wide   neo p tta (n p ta)      neo l tta (n l ta)             to read  (continuative form)   i l kko (i l ko)      i l kko (i l ko)             Amnok River   am r okgang (am r okkang)      am n okkang (am n okkang)             independence   dong r ip (tong r ip)      dong n ip (tong n ip)             idea / sense / conception   gwa ll yeom (kwa ll ym)      gwa nn yeom (kwa nn ym)          *   innovative   hyeoksin jj eok (hyksin tch k)      hyeoksin j eok (hyksin j k)          * Similar pronunciation is used in the North whenever the hanja """" is attached to a Sino-Korean word ending in ,  or . (In the South, this rule only applies when it is attached to any single-character Sino-Korean word.)     [ edit ]   Spelling   Some words are spelled differently by the North and the South, but the pronunciations are the same.       Word spelling   Meaning   Pronunciation (RR/MR)   Remarks       North   South             sunshine   haeppit (haepit)   The ""sai siot"" ('' used for indicating sound change) is almost never written out in the North.             cherry blossom   beotkkot (ptkkot)                cannot read   monnikda (monnikta)   Spacing.             Hallasan   hallasan (hallasan)   When a - combination is pronounced as  ll , the original Hangul spelling is kept in the North, while the Hangul is changed in the South.             rules   gyuyul (kyuyul)   In words where the original hanja is spelt """" or """" and follows a vowel, the initial  is not pronounced in the North, making the pronunciation identical with that in the South where the  is dropped in the spelling.         [ edit ]   Spelling and pronunciation   Some words have different spellings and pronunciations in the North and the South, some of which were given in the ""Phonology"" section above:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          ryeongryang (ryngryang)      yeongnyang (yngnyang)   strength   Korean words originally starting in  r  or  n  have their  r  or  n  dropped in the South Korean version if the sound following it is an  i  or  y  sound.          rodong (rodong)      nodong (nodong)   work   Korean words originally starting in  r  have their  r  changed to  n  in the South Korean version if the sound following it is a sound other than  i  or  y .          wonssu (wnssu)      wonsu (wnsu)   mortal enemy   ""Mortal enemy"" and ""head of state"" are homophones in the South. Possibly to avoid referring to  Kim Il-sung  /  Kim Jong-il  as the enemy, the second syllable of ""enemy"" is written and pronounced  in the North.          rajio (rajio)      radio (radio)   radio            u (u)      wi (wi)   on; above            anhae (anhae)      anae (anae)   wife            kkuba (kkuba)      kuba (k'uba)   Cuba   When transcribing foreign words from languages that do not have contrasts between aspirated and unaspirated stops, North Koreans generally use tensed stops for the unaspirated ones while South Koreans use aspirated stops in both cases.          pe (p'e)      pye (p'ye), pe (p'e)   lungs   All hanja pronounced as  pye  ( p'ye ) or  pe  ( p'e ) in the South are pronounced as  pe  ( p'e ) in the North. The spelling is also accordingly different.       In general, when transcribing place names, North Korea tends to use the pronunciation in the original language more than South Korea, which often uses the pronunciation in English. For example:       Original name   North Korea transliteration   English name   South Korea transliteration       Spelling   Pronunciation   Spelling   Pronunciaton       Ulaanbaatar      ullanbattareu (ullanbattar)   Ulan Bator      ullanbatoreu (ullanbat'or)       Kbenhavn      koeppenhabeun (k'oeppenhabn)   Copenhagen      kopenhagen (k'op'enhagen)       al-Qhirah      kkahira (kkahira)   Cairo      kairo (k'airo)         [ edit ]   Grammar   Some grammatical constructions are also different:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          doeyeotda (toeytta)      doeeotda (toetta)   past tense of  (doeda/toeda), ""to become""   All similar grammar forms of verbs or adjectives that end in  in the stem (i.e. , , , ,  and ) in the North use  instead of the South's .          gomawayo (komawayo)      gomawoyo (komawyo)   thanks   -irregular verbs in the North use  (wa) for all those with a positive ending vowel; this only happens in the South if the verb stem has only one syllable.          halgayo (halkayo)      halkkayo (halkkayo)   Shall we do?   Although the Hangul differ, the pronunciations are the same (i.e. with the tensed  sound).         [ edit ]   Vocabulary   Some vocabulary is different between the North and the South:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          munhwajutaek (munhwajut'aek)      apateu (ap'at')   Apartment     (appateu/appat') is also used in the North.          joseonmal (chosnmal)      han-gugeo(han'gugeo)   Korean language            gwakbap (kwakpap)      dosirak (tosirak)   lunch box           [ edit ]   Others   In the North,  guillemets     and    are the symbols used for quotes; in the South, quotation marks equivalent to the English ones,  and , are standard, although     and     are sometimes used in popular novels.     [ edit ]   Study by non-native speakers   The  United States '  Defense Language Institute  classifies Korean alongside  Arabic ,  Chinese , and  Japanese  as a Category IV language, meaning that 63 weeks of instruction (as compared to just 25 weeks for  French ,  Spanish ,  Portuguese , and  Italian ) are required to bring an English-speaking student to a limited working level of proficiency in which he or she has ""sufficient capability to meet routine social demands and limited job requirements"" and ""can deal with concrete topics in past, present, and future tense."" [ 10 ]  As a result, the study of the Korean language in the United States is dominated by  Korean American  heritage language students; they are estimated to form over 80% of all students of the language at non-military universities. [ 11 ]   However, Korean is considerably easier for speakers of certain other languages, such as Japanese, Mongolian and Turkic languages; in Japan, it is more widely studied by non-heritage learners. [ 12 ]  The  Korean Language Proficiency Test , an examination aimed at assessing non-native speakers' competence in Korean, was instituted in 1997; 17,000 people applied for the 2005 sitting of the examination.

Korean  (  /  , see  below ) is the official  language  of  North Korea  and  South Korea . It is also one of the two official languages in the  Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture  in  China . There are about 78 million Korean speakers. It was formerly written using  Hanja , borrowed  Chinese characters  pronounced in the Korean way. In the 15th century a national writing system was developed by  Sejong the Great , nowadays called  Hangul .   The genealogical  classification  of the Korean language is debated. Some linguists place it in the  Altaic  language family, while others consider it to be a  language isolate . It is  agglutinative  in its morphology and  SOV  in its  syntax .

In South Korea, the language is most often called  Hangungmal  (  ;   ), or more formally,  Hangugeo  (  ;   ) or  Gugeo  (  ;   ; literally ""national language"").   In North Korea and Yanbian in China, the language is most often called  Chosnmal  (  ; with  hanja :   ), or more formally,  Chosn  (  ;   ).   On the other hand, Korean people in the  former USSR , who refer to themselves as  Koryo-saram  (also  Goryeoin  [  ;   ; literally, "" Goryeo  person(s)""]) call the language  Goryeomal  (  ;   ).   In  mainland China , following the establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992, the term  Choxiny  (   or short form:  Choy  (  )) has normally been used to refer to the language spoken in North Korea and Yanbian, while  Hnguy  (   or short form:  Hny  (  )) is used to refer to the language spoken in South Korea.   Some older English sources also used the name ""Korean"" to refer to the language, country, and people.     [ edit ]   History       Main article:  History of the Korean language       Korean is descended from  Old Korean  and  Middle Korean .     [ edit ]   Classification   The classification of the modern Korean language is uncertain, and due to the lack of any one generally accepted theory, it is sometimes described conservatively as a  language isolate .   On the other hand, since the publication of the article of  Ramstedt  in 1926, many linguists support the hypothesis that Korean can be classified as an  Altaic  language, or as a relative of proto-Altaic. Korean is similar to Altaic languages in that they both lack certain grammatical elements, including  number ,  gender ,  articles , fusional morphology, voice, and  relative pronouns  (Kim Namkil). Korean especially bears some  morphological  resemblance to some languages of the Northern Turkic group, namely  Sakha (Yakut) . Vinokurova, a scholar of the Sakha language, noted that like in Korean, and unlike in other  Turkic languages  or a variety of other languages surveyed, adverbs in Sakha are derived from verbs with the help of derivational morphology; however, she did not suggest this implied any relation between the two languages. [ 2 ]   It is also considered likely that Korean is related in some way to  Japanese , since the two languages have nearly identical grammatical structures, and share a number of possible phonological cognates (though a majority of them are likely due to local pronunciations of the Chinese characters from which they are derived), as noted by such researchers as  Samuel E. Martin  and  Roy Andrew Miller  in the late 1960s.  Sergei Starostin  (1991) found about 25% of potential cognates in the Japanese-Korean 100-word  Swadesh list , which places these two languages closer together than other possible members of the Altaic family. [ 3 ]   Genetic relationships have been postulated both directly and indirectly, the latter either through placing both languages in the Altaic family, or by arguing for a relationship between Japanese and the  Buyeo languages  of  Goguryeo  and  Baekje  (see below); the proposed Baekje relationship is supported by cognates such as Baekje  mir , Japanese  mi-  ""three"". [ 4 ]   The possible relationship between Korean and Japanese can be exemplified by such basic vocabularly items as J.     mizu  (Old J.  midu ) : K.     mul  (Middle K.  mirh ) ""water"",  mot  ""lake""; J.     ku-ru  ""come"" (Old J.  ku , also cf. irregular root changes as in past tense   ki-ta , negative   ko-nai  in Modern J.) : K.     ka-da  (""go""); J.     kata-i  ""hard"" (whence     kata-na  ""knife, sword"") : K.  kud-yn  (hard); J.     i-ru  ""to be"" (past tense   i-ta ) : K.     i-da  ""to be""; J.  na ,  -en  : K.  anh  ""not"", J.  minna  (Old J.  mynna ) ""all, everyone"" : K.  manh-  ""many"" (predicate  mana-da ), etc.  [ 5 ] . The same possible cognates are often observed in other members of the potential  Altaic family , esp. in the  Tungusic languages . Cf. Nanay  mue  ""water"",  giagda-  ""to walk"",  anaa, anna  ""not"".   Others argue, however, that the similarities are not due to any genetic relationship, but rather to a  sprachbund  effect. See  East Asian languages  for morphological features shared among languages of the East Asian  sprachbund , and  Japanese language classification  for further details on the possible relationship.   It is presumed that modern Korean may be more closely related to the languages of  Samhan  and  Silla  than the Buyeo languages; many Korean scholars believe they were mutually intelligible, and the collective basis of what in the  Goryeo  period would merge to become Middle Korean (the language before the changes that the  Seven-Year War  brought) and eventually Modern Korean. The  Jeju dialect  preserves some archaic features that can also be found in Middle Korean, whose  arae a  is retained in the dialect as a distinct vowel.   There are also more marginal hypotheses proposing various other relationships; for example, a few scholars, such as  Homer B. Hulbert  (1905), have tried to relate Korean to the  Dravidian languages  through the similar syntax in both. [ 6 ]   Though not related to Chinese, it has borrowed heavily; see the Vocabulary section below.     [ edit ]   Dialects       Main article:  Korean dialects              Dialects of Korean       Korean has several  dialects  (called  mal  [literally ""speech""],  saturi , or  bang-eon  in Korean). The  standard language  ( pyojuneo  or  pyojunmal ) of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  P'yngyang . These dialects are similar, and are in fact all mutually intelligible, perhaps with the exception of the dialect of  Jeju Island  (see  Jeju dialect ). The dialect spoken in Jeju is in fact classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of  Seoul dialect  use very little stress, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of the  Gyeongsang dialect  have a very pronounced intonation.   It is also worth noting that there is substantial evidence for a history of extensive  dialect levelling , or even  convergent evolution  or intermixture of two or more originally distinct linguistic stocks, within the Korean language and its dialects. Many Korean dialects have basic vocabulary that is etymologically distinct from vocabulary of identical meaning in Standard Korean or other dialects, such as South Jeolla dialect /kur/ vs. Standard Korean     /ip/  ""mouth"" or Gyeongsang dialect  /.u.i/  vs. Standard Korean  /puu/  "" garlic chives ."" This suggests that the Korean Peninsula may have at one time been much more linguistically diverse than it is at present. [ citation needed ]  See also the  Buyeo languages   hypothesis .   There is a very close connection between the dialects of Korean and the  regions of Korea , since the boundaries of both are largely determined by mountains and seas. Here is a list of traditional dialect names and locations:       Standard dialect   Where used       Seoul   Seoul  (),  Incheon  (/), most of  Gyeonggi  (/)       P'yngan  (/)   P'yngyang ,  P'yngan  region,  Chagang  (North Korea)       Regional dialect   Where used       Gyeonggi   limited areas of the  Gyeonggi  region (South Korea)       Chungcheong   Daejeon ,  Chungcheong  region (South Korea)       Gangwon   Gangwon-do (South Korea) / Kangwn (North Korea)       Gyeongsang   Busan ,  Daegu ,  Ulsan ,  Gyeongsang  region (South Korea)       Hamgyng   Rasn ,  Hamgyng  region,  Ryanggang  (North Korea)       Hwanghae   Hwanghae  region (North Korea)       Jeju   Jeju Island/Province  (South Korea)       Jeolla   Gwangju ,  Jeolla  region (South Korea)         [ edit ]   Phonology       This article contains  IPA  phonetic symbols.

Main article:  Korean phonology         [ edit ]   Consonants          The Korean consonants             Bilabial   Alveolar   Post-  alveolar   Velar   Glottal       Nasal      /m/      /n/        //  (syllable-final)         Plosive  and   Affricate   plain      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         tense      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         aspirated      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         Fricative   plain        /s/          /h/       tense        /s/             Liquid        /l/           The  IPA  symbol <  > (a subscript double straight quotation mark, shown here with a placeholder circle) is used to denote the tensed consonants  /p/, /t/, /k/, //, /s/ . Its official use in the  Extensions to the IPA  is for  'strong'  articulation, but is used in the literature for  faucalized voice . The Korean consonants also have elements of  stiff voice , but it is not yet known how typical this is of faucalized consonants. They are produced with a partially constricted  glottis  and additional subglottal pressure in addition to tense vocal tract walls, laryngeal lowering, or other expansion of the larynx.     [ edit ]   Vowels                    The Korean basic vowels                 Monophthongs   /i/    ,  /e/    ,  //    ,  /a/    ,  /o/    ,  /u/    ,  //    ,  //    ,  //          Vowels preceded by intermediaries,  or Diphthongs   /je/    ,  /j/    ,  /ja/    ,  /wi/    ,  /we/    ,  /w/    ,  /wa/    ,  /i/    ,  /jo/    ,  /ju/    ,  /j/    ,  /w/            [ edit ]   Allophones   /s/  becomes an  alveolo-palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i]  for most speakers (but see  Differences in the language between North Korea and South Korea ). This occurs with the tense fricative and all the affricates as well. At the end of a syllable, /s/ changes to /t/ (Example: beoseot () 'mushroom').   /h/  may become a  bilabial   []  before  [o]  or  [u] , a  palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i] , a  velar   [x]  before  [] , a voiced  []  between voiced sounds, and a  [h]  elsewhere. [ citation needed ]   /p, t, , k/  become voiced  [b, d, , ]  between voiced sounds.   /l/  becomes alveolar flap  []  between vowels, and  [l]  or  []  at the end of a syllable or next to another  /l/ . Note that a written syllable-final '', when followed by a vowel or a glide ( i.e. , when the next character starts with ''), migrates to the next syllable and thus becomes  [] .   Traditionally,  /l/  was disallowed at the beginning of a word. It disappeared before  [j] , and otherwise became  /n/ . However, the inflow of western loanword changed the trend, and now word-initial  /l/  (mostly from English loanwords) are pronounced as a free variation of either  []  or  [l] . The traditional prohibition of word-initial  /l/  became a morphological rule called ""initial law"" () in South Korea, which pertains to Sino-Korean vocabulary. Such words retain their word-initial  /l/  in North Korea.   All  obstruents  (plosives, affricates, fricatives) are  unreleased   [p, t, k]  at the end of a word.   Plosive stops  /p, t, k/  become nasal stops  [m, n, ]  before nasal stops.   Hangul  spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying, partly historical  morphology . Given this, it is sometimes hard to tell which actual phonemes are present in a certain word.   One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial  [r] , and initial  [n] . For example,     ""labour"" - north:  r odong  (), south:  n odong  ()   ""history"" - north:  ry ksa  (), south:  y eoksa  ()   ""female"" - north:  ny ja  (), south:  y eoja  ()       [ edit ]   Morphophonemics   Grammatical morphemes may change shape depending on the preceding sounds. Examples include  -eun/-neun  (-/-) and  -i/-ga  (-/-). Sometimes sounds may be inserted instead. Examples include  -eul/-reul  (-/-),  -euro/-ro  (-/-),  -eseo/-seo  (-/-),  -ideunji/-deunji  (-/-) and  -iya/-ya  (-/-). However,  -euro/-ro  is somewhat irregular, since it will behave differently after a rieul consonant.     Korean particles     After a consonant   After a rieul   After a vowel       -ui  (-)       -eun  (-)   -neun  (-)       -i  (-)   -ga  (-)       -eul  (-)   -reul  (-)       -gwa  (-)   -wa  (-)       -euro  (-)   -ro  (-)       Some verbs may also change shape morphophonemically.     [ edit ]   Grammar       Main article:  Korean grammar         [ edit ]   Sentence structure   Korean is an  agglutinative language . Modifiers generally follow the modified word, and in the case of verb modifiers, can be serially appended. The basic form of a Korean sentence is  Subject Object Verb , but the verb is the only required and immovable element.       A :       -       -? (?)           gage-e     gasseo-yo           store + [location marker ()]     [go (verb root) ()]+[conjunctive ()]+[past ()]+[conjunctive ()]+ [interrogative marker ()]         ""Did [you] go to the store?"" (with ""you"" implied by context)         B :       .           ne           yes         ""Yes.""       [ edit ]   Parts of speech     [ edit ]   Verb   Korean  verbs  (  ,  dongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""action verbs"" or ""dynamic verbs"" to distinguish them from [  () ,  hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""]), which are also known as ""descriptive verbs"" or ""stative verbs"". Examples of action/dynamic verbs include    ( hada , ""to do, to have"") and    ( gada , ""to go"") which constitute an action or movement as opposed to descriptive verbs such as    ( yehppeuda , ""to be beautiful""). For a larger list of Korean verbs, see  wikt:Category:Korean verbs .   Unlike most of the European languages, Korean does not conjugate verbs using agreement with the subject, and nouns have no gender. Instead, verb conjugations depend upon the verb tense, aspect, mood, and the social relation between the speaker, the subjects, and the listeners. The system of speech levels and honorifics loosely resembles the  T-V distinction  of most  Indo-European languages . For example, different endings are used based on whether the subjects and listeners are friends, parents, or honoured persons.     [ edit ]   Adjective   Words categorized as Korean  adjectives  (  ,  hyeong-yongsa ,   ) conjugate similarly to verbs, so some English texts call them ""descriptive verbs"" or "" stative verbs "", but they are distinctly separate from    ( dongsa ).   English does not have an identical grammatical category, so the English translation of Korean adjectives may misleadingly suggest that they are verbs. For example,    ( bukda ) translates literally as ""to be red"" and    ( aswipda ) often best translates as ""to lack"" or ""to want for"", but both are    ( hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""). For a larger list of Korean adjectives, see  wikt:Category:Korean adjectives .     [ edit ]   Determiner   Korean  determiners  (  ,  gwanhyeongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""determinatives"", ""adnominals"", ""pre-nouns"", ""attributives"", and ""unconjugated adjectives"". Examples include    ( gak , ""each""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean determiners .     [ edit ]   Noun   A large body of Korean  nouns  (  ,  myeongsa ,   ) stem from  Chinese characters , e.g.    (,  san , mountain),    (,  yeok , station),    (,  munhwa , culture), etc. Others are native to the Korean language, e.g.    ( nara , country),    ( nal , day). Many  Sino-Korean words  have a native Korean equivalent and vice versa, but not always. Nouns do not have  grammatical gender  and can be made  plural  by adding  to the end of the word, however in most instances the  singular  form is used even when in English it would be translated as plural. For example, while in English the sentence  ""there are three apples""  would use the plural  ""apples""  instead of the singular  ""apple"" , the Korean sentence    ( sagwa segae isssumnida ) maintains the word  ( sagwa , ""apple"") in its singular form, thus rendered in English as ""apple three(things) exist."" For a list of Korean nouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean nouns .     [ edit ]   Pronoun       Main article:  Korean pronouns       Korean  pronouns  (  ,  daemyeongsa ,   ) are highly influenced by the honorifics in the language. Pronouns change forms depending on the social status of the person or persons spoken to, e.g. the pronoun for ""I"" there is both the informal    ( na ) and the honorific/humble    ( jeo ). In general second person singular pronouns are avoided, especially when using honorific forms. For a larger list or Korean pronouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean pronouns .     [ edit ]   Adverb   Korean  adverbs  (  ,  busa ,   ) include    ( tto , ""also"") and    ( gadeuk , ""fully""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean adverbs .     [ edit ]   Particle   Korean  particles  (  ,  josa ,   ) are also known in English as "" postpositions "". Examples include    ( neun , topic marker) and    ( reul , object marker). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean particles .     [ edit ]   Interjection   Korean  interjections  (  ,  gamtansa ,   ) are also known in English as ""exclamations"". Examples include    ( ani , ""no""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean interjections .     [ edit ]   Number       Main article:  Korean numerals       Korean  numbers  or numerals (  ,  sutja ,   ) consitute two regularly used sets: a native Korean set and a  Sino-Korean  set. The Sino-Korean system is nearly entirely based on the  Chinese numerals . The distinction between the two numeral systems is very important. Everything that can be counted will use one of the two systems, but seldom both. Sino-Korean words are sometimes used to mark ordinal usage: yeol beon ( ) means ""ten times"" while sip beon (() ()) means ""number ten."" The grouping of large numbers in Korean follow the Chinese tradition of myriads (10000) rather than thousands (1000) as is common in Europe and North America.     [ edit ]   Speech levels and honorifics       Main article:  Korean honorifics       The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean, and the grammar reflects this. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject referent is reflected in  honorifics , while that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in  speech level .     [ edit ]   Honorifics   When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a younger stranger, student, employee or the like. Nowadays, there are special endings which can be used on declarative, interrogative, and imperative sentences; and both honorific or normal sentences. They are made for easier and faster use of Korean.     [ edit ]   Speech levels   There are seven verb  paradigms  or  speech levels  in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation. [ citation needed ]  Unlike  honorifics   which are used to show respect towards the referent   speech levels  are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience. The names of the 7 levels are derived from the non-honorific  imperative  form of the verb    ( hada , ""do"") in each level, plus the suffix  ('che',  hanja :   ), which means ""style.""   The highest 6 levels are generally grouped together as  jondaenmal  (), while the lowest level ( haeche , ) is called  banmal  () in Korean.     [ edit ]   Vocabulary   The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words. Like Japanese and Vietnamese, more than 50% of the vocabulary (up to 60% by some estimates), especially words that denote abstract ideas, are  Sino-Korean words , [ 7 ]  either     directly borrowed from  Written Chinese , or   coined in Japan or Korea using  Chinese characters ,     in a similar way European languages borrow from Latin and Greek. Korean has two  number systems : one native, and one borrowed from Chinese.   To a much lesser extent, words have also occasionally been borrowed from  Mongolian ,  Sanskrit , and other languages. Conversely, the Korean language itself has also contributed some loanwords to other languages, most notably the  Tsushima dialect  of Japanese.   The vast majority of loanwords other than Sino-Korean come from modern times, 90% of which are from  English . [ 8 ]  Many words have also been borrowed from  Japanese  and  Western languages  such as  German  ( areubaiteu  part-time job,  allereugi  allergy). Some Western words were borrowed indirectly via Japanese, taking a Japanese sound pattern, for example dozen >     dsu  >     daseu . Most indirect Western borrowings are now written according to current Hangulization rules for the respective Western language, as if borrowed directly. There are a few more complicated borrowings such as German(y) (see  Names for Germany ), the first part of whose  endonym   [d.lant]  the Japanese approximated using the  kanji      doitsu  that were then accepted into the Korean language by their Sino-Korean pronunciation:     dok  +     il  =  Dogil . In South Korean official use, a number of other Sino-Korean country names have been replaced with phonetically oriented Hangulizations of the countries' endonyms or English names.   North Korean vocabulary shows a tendency to prefer native Korean over Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings, especially with recent political objectives aimed at eliminating foreign (mostly Chinese) influences on the Korean language in the North. By contrast, South Korean may have several Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings which tend to be absent in North Korean.     [ edit ]   Writing system       Korean writing systems           Hangul       Hanja       Hyangchal   Gugyeol   Idu       Mixed script       Korean romanization       Revised Romanization of Korean   McCune-Reischauer   Yale Romanization               Main article:  Hangul     See also:  Hangul consonant and vowel tables     In ancient times, the languages of the Korean peninsula were written using  Chinese characters , using  hyangchal  or  idu . Such systems were not popular because hanja is not well suited to the Korean language. Its use limited some cases and the aristocracy prefers  Classical Chinese  for its writing.   Korean is now mainly written in Hangul, the Korean alphabet promulgated in 1446 by  Sejong the Great ;  hanja may be mixed in  to write  Sino-Korean words . South Korea still teaches 1800 hanja characters in its schools, while the North abolished the use of hanja decades ago.   Below is a chart of the Korean alphabet's symbols and their canonical  IPA  values:     Consonants     Hangul                                                                        RR   b , p   d , t   j   g , k   pp   tt   jj   kk   p   t   ch   k   s   h   ss   m   n   ng       r , l           IPA   p   t      k   p   t      k   p   t      k   s   h   s   m   n      w   r   j         Vowels     Hangul                                                                      RR   i   e   oe   ae   a   o   u   eo   eu   ui   ye   yae   ya   yo   yu   yeo   wi   we   wae   wa   wo       IPA   i   e         a   o   u         i   je   j   ja   jo   ju   j   wi   we   w   wa   w       Modern Korean is written with  spaces  between  words , a feature not found in Chinese or Japanese. Korean  punctuation  marks are almost identical to Western ones. Traditionally, Korean was written in columns from top to bottom, right to left, but is now usually written in rows from left to right, top to bottom.     [ edit ]   Differences between North Korean and South Korean       Main article:  Korean language North-South differences       The Korean language used in the North and the South exhibits differences in pronunciation, spelling, grammar and vocabulary. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Pronunciation   In North Korea,  palatalization  of  /si/  is optional, and  //  can be pronounced as  [z]  in between vowels.   Words that are written the same way may be pronounced differently, such as the examples below. The pronunciations below are given in  Revised Romanization ,  McCune-Reischauer  and Hangul, the last of which represents what the Hangul would be if one writes the word as pronounced.       Word   Meaning   Pronunciation       North (RR/MR)   North (Hangul)   South (RR/MR)   South (Hangul)          wide   neo p tta (n p ta)      neo l tta (n l ta)             to read  (continuative form)   i l kko (i l ko)      i l kko (i l ko)             Amnok River   am r okgang (am r okkang)      am n okkang (am n okkang)             independence   dong r ip (tong r ip)      dong n ip (tong n ip)             idea / sense / conception   gwa ll yeom (kwa ll ym)      gwa nn yeom (kwa nn ym)          *   innovative   hyeoksin jj eok (hyksin tch k)      hyeoksin j eok (hyksin j k)          * Similar pronunciation is used in the North whenever the hanja """" is attached to a Sino-Korean word ending in ,  or . (In the South, this rule only applies when it is attached to any single-character Sino-Korean word.)     [ edit ]   Spelling   Some words are spelled differently by the North and the South, but the pronunciations are the same.       Word spelling   Meaning   Pronunciation (RR/MR)   Remarks       North   South             sunshine   haeppit (haepit)   The ""sai siot"" ('' used for indicating sound change) is almost never written out in the North.             cherry blossom   beotkkot (ptkkot)                cannot read   monnikda (monnikta)   Spacing.             Hallasan   hallasan (hallasan)   When a - combination is pronounced as  ll , the original Hangul spelling is kept in the North, while the Hangul is changed in the South.             rules   gyuyul (kyuyul)   In words where the original hanja is spelt """" or """" and follows a vowel, the initial  is not pronounced in the North, making the pronunciation identical with that in the South where the  is dropped in the spelling.         [ edit ]   Spelling and pronunciation   Some words have different spellings and pronunciations in the North and the South, some of which were given in the ""Phonology"" section above:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          ryeongryang (ryngryang)      yeongnyang (yngnyang)   strength   Korean words originally starting in  r  or  n  have their  r  or  n  dropped in the South Korean version if the sound following it is an  i  or  y  sound.          rodong (rodong)      nodong (nodong)   work   Korean words originally starting in  r  have their  r  changed to  n  in the South Korean version if the sound following it is a sound other than  i  or  y .          wonssu (wnssu)      wonsu (wnsu)   mortal enemy   ""Mortal enemy"" and ""head of state"" are homophones in the South. Possibly to avoid referring to  Kim Il-sung  /  Kim Jong-il  as the enemy, the second syllable of ""enemy"" is written and pronounced  in the North.          rajio (rajio)      radio (radio)   radio            u (u)      wi (wi)   on; above            anhae (anhae)      anae (anae)   wife            kkuba (kkuba)      kuba (k'uba)   Cuba   When transcribing foreign words from languages that do not have contrasts between aspirated and unaspirated stops, North Koreans generally use tensed stops for the unaspirated ones while South Koreans use aspirated stops in both cases.          pe (p'e)      pye (p'ye), pe (p'e)   lungs   All hanja pronounced as  pye  ( p'ye ) or  pe  ( p'e ) in the South are pronounced as  pe  ( p'e ) in the North. The spelling is also accordingly different.       In general, when transcribing place names, North Korea tends to use the pronunciation in the original language more than South Korea, which often uses the pronunciation in English. For example:       Original name   North Korea transliteration   English name   South Korea transliteration       Spelling   Pronunciation   Spelling   Pronunciaton       Ulaanbaatar      ullanbattareu (ullanbattar)   Ulan Bator      ullanbatoreu (ullanbat'or)       Kbenhavn      koeppenhabeun (k'oeppenhabn)   Copenhagen      kopenhagen (k'op'enhagen)       al-Qhirah      kkahira (kkahira)   Cairo      kairo (k'airo)         [ edit ]   Grammar   Some grammatical constructions are also different:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          doeyeotda (toeytta)      doeeotda (toetta)   past tense of  (doeda/toeda), ""to become""   All similar grammar forms of verbs or adjectives that end in  in the stem (i.e. , , , ,  and ) in the North use  instead of the South's .          gomawayo (komawayo)      gomawoyo (komawyo)   thanks   -irregular verbs in the North use  (wa) for all those with a positive ending vowel; this only happens in the South if the verb stem has only one syllable.          halgayo (halkayo)      halkkayo (halkkayo)   Shall we do?   Although the Hangul differ, the pronunciations are the same (i.e. with the tensed  sound).         [ edit ]   Vocabulary   Some vocabulary is different between the North and the South:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          munhwajutaek (munhwajut'aek)      apateu (ap'at')   Apartment     (appateu/appat') is also used in the North.          joseonmal (chosnmal)      han-gugeo(han'gugeo)   Korean language            gwakbap (kwakpap)      dosirak (tosirak)   lunch box           [ edit ]   Others   In the North,  guillemets     and    are the symbols used for quotes; in the South, quotation marks equivalent to the English ones,  and , are standard, although     and     are sometimes used in popular novels.     [ edit ]   Study by non-native speakers   The  United States '  Defense Language Institute  classifies Korean alongside  Arabic ,  Chinese , and  Japanese  as a Category IV language, meaning that 63 weeks of instruction (as compared to just 25 weeks for  French ,  Spanish ,  Portuguese , and  Italian ) are required to bring an English-speaking student to a limited working level of proficiency in which he or she has ""sufficient capability to meet routine social demands and limited job requirements"" and ""can deal with concrete topics in past, present, and future tense."" [ 10 ]  As a result, the study of the Korean language in the United States is dominated by  Korean American  heritage language students; they are estimated to form over 80% of all students of the language at non-military universities. [ 11 ]   However, Korean is considerably easier for speakers of certain other languages, such as Japanese, Mongolian and Turkic languages; in Japan, it is more widely studied by non-heritage learners. [ 12 ]  The  Korean Language Proficiency Test , an examination aimed at assessing non-native speakers' competence in Korean, was instituted in 1997; 17,000 people applied for the 2005 sitting of the examination.

Korean  (  /  , see  below ) is the official  language  of  North Korea  and  South Korea . It is also one of the two official languages in the  Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture  in  China . There are about 78 million Korean speakers. It was formerly written using  Hanja , borrowed  Chinese characters  pronounced in the Korean way. In the 15th century a national writing system was developed by  Sejong the Great , nowadays called  Hangul .   The genealogical  classification  of the Korean language is debated. Some linguists place it in the  Altaic  language family, while others consider it to be a  language isolate . It is  agglutinative  in its morphology and  SOV  in its  syntax .

In South Korea, the language is most often called  Hangungmal  (  ;   ), or more formally,  Hangugeo  (  ;   ) or  Gugeo  (  ;   ; literally ""national language"").   In North Korea and Yanbian in China, the language is most often called  Chosnmal  (  ; with  hanja :   ), or more formally,  Chosn  (  ;   ).   On the other hand, Korean people in the  former USSR , who refer to themselves as  Koryo-saram  (also  Goryeoin  [  ;   ; literally, "" Goryeo  person(s)""]) call the language  Goryeomal  (  ;   ).   In  mainland China , following the establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992, the term  Choxiny  (   or short form:  Choy  (  )) has normally been used to refer to the language spoken in North Korea and Yanbian, while  Hnguy  (   or short form:  Hny  (  )) is used to refer to the language spoken in South Korea.   Some older English sources also used the name ""Korean"" to refer to the language, country, and people.     [ edit ]   History   Main article:  History of the Korean language   Korean is descended from  Old Korean  and  Middle Korean .     [ edit ]   Classification   The classification of the modern Korean language is uncertain, and due to the lack of any one generally accepted theory, it is sometimes described conservatively as a  language isolate .   On the other hand, since the publication of the article of  Ramstedt  in 1926, many linguists support the hypothesis that Korean can be classified as an  Altaic  language, or as a relative of proto-Altaic. Korean is similar to Altaic languages in that they both lack certain grammatical elements, including  number ,  gender ,  articles , fusional morphology, voice, and  relative pronouns  (Kim Namkil). Korean especially bears some  morphological  resemblance to some languages of the Northern Turkic group, namely  Sakha (Yakut) . Vinokurova, a scholar of the Sakha language, noted that like in Korean, and unlike in other  Turkic languages  or a variety of other languages surveyed, adverbs in Sakha are derived from verbs with the help of derivational morphology; however, she did not suggest this implied any relation between the two languages. [ 2 ]   It is also considered likely that Korean is related in some way to  Japanese , since the two languages have nearly identical grammatical structures, and share a number of possible phonological cognates (though a majority of them are likely due to local pronunciations of the Chinese characters from which they are derived), as noted by such researchers as  Samuel E. Martin  and  Roy Andrew Miller  in the late 1960s.  Sergei Starostin  (1991) found about 25% of potential cognates in the Japanese-Korean 100-word  Swadesh list , which places these two languages closer together than other possible members of the Altaic family. [ 3 ]   Genetic relationships have been postulated both directly and indirectly, the latter either through placing both languages in the Altaic family, or by arguing for a relationship between Japanese and the  Buyeo languages  of  Goguryeo  and  Baekje  (see below); the proposed Baekje relationship is supported by cognates such as Baekje  mir , Japanese  mi-  ""three"". [ 4 ]   The possible relationship between Korean and Japanese can be exemplified by such basic vocabularly items as J.     mizu  (Old J.  midu ) : K.     mul  (Middle K.  mirh ) ""water"",  mot  ""lake""; J.     ku-ru  ""come"" (Old J.  ku , also cf. irregular root changes as in past tense   ki-ta , negative   ko-nai  in Modern J.) : K.     ka-da  (""go""); J.     kata-i  ""hard"" (whence     kata-na  ""knife, sword"") : K.  kud-yn  (hard); J.     i-ru  ""to be"" (past tense   i-ta ) : K.     i-da  ""to be""; J.  na ,  -en  : K.  anh  ""not"", J.  minna  (Old J.  mynna ) ""all, everyone"" : K.  manh-  ""many"" (predicate  mana-da ), etc.  [ 5 ] . The same possible cognates are often observed in other members of the potential  Altaic family , esp. in the  Tungusic languages . Cf. Nanay  mue  ""water"",  giagda-  ""to walk"",  anaa, anna  ""not"".   Others argue, however, that the similarities are not due to any genetic relationship, but rather to a  sprachbund  effect. [ citation needed ]  See  East Asian languages  for morphological features shared among languages of the East Asian  sprachbund , and  Classification of Japanese  for further details on the possible relationship. Though it is very difficult to believe words such as ""water"", ""to be"", and ""to go"" arise from sprachbund effects.   It is presumed that modern Korean may be more closely related to the languages of  Samhan  and  Silla  than the Buyeo languages; many Korean scholars believe they were mutually intelligible, and the collective basis of what in the  Goryeo  period would merge to become Middle Korean (the language before the changes that the  Seven-Year War  brought) and eventually Modern Korean. The  Jeju dialect  preserves some archaic features that can also be found in Middle Korean, whose  arae a  is retained in the dialect as a distinct vowel.   There are also more marginal hypotheses proposing various other relationships; for example, a few scholars, such as  Homer B. Hulbert  (1905), have tried to relate Korean to the  Dravidian languages  through the similar syntax in both. [ 6 ]   Though not related to Chinese, it has borrowed heavily; see the Vocabulary section below.     [ edit ]   Dialects   Main article:  Korean dialects          Dialects of Korean       Korean has several  dialects  (called  mal  [literally ""speech""],  saturi , or  bang-eon  in Korean). The  standard language  ( pyojuneo  or  pyojunmal ) of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  P'yngyang . All dialects of Korean are similar to each other, and are in fact all mutually intelligible, perhaps with the exception of the dialect of  Jeju Island  (see  Jeju dialect ). The dialect spoken in Jeju is in fact classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of  Seoul dialect  use very little stress, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of the  Gyeongsang dialect  have a very pronounced intonation.   It is also worth noting that there is substantial evidence for a history of extensive  dialect levelling , or even  convergent evolution  or intermixture of two or more originally distinct linguistic stocks, within the Korean language and its dialects. Many Korean dialects have basic vocabulary that is etymologically distinct from vocabulary of identical meaning in Standard Korean or other dialects, such as South Jeolla dialect /kur/ vs. Standard Korean     /ip/  ""mouth"" or Gyeongsang dialect  /.u.i/  vs. Standard Korean  /puu/  "" garlic chives ."" This suggests that the Korean Peninsula may have at one time been much more linguistically diverse than it is at present. See also the  Buyeo languages   hypothesis .   There is a very close connection between the dialects of Korean and the  regions of Korea , since the boundaries of both are largely determined by mountains and seas. Here is a list of traditional dialect names and locations:       Standard dialect   Where used       Seoul   Seoul  (),  Incheon  (/), most of  Gyeonggi  (/)       P'yngan  (/)   P'yngyang ,  P'yngan  region,  Chagang  (North Korea)       Regional dialect   Where used       Gyeonggi   limited areas of the  Gyeonggi  region (South Korea)       Chungcheong   Daejeon ,  Chungcheong  region (South Korea)       Gangwon   Gangwon-do (South Korea) / Kangwn (North Korea)       Gyeongsang   Busan ,  Daegu ,  Ulsan ,  Gyeongsang  region (South Korea)       Hamgyng   Rasn ,  Hamgyng  region,  Ryanggang  (North Korea)       Hwanghae   Hwanghae  region (North Korea)       Jeju   Jeju Island/Province  (South Korea)       Jeolla   Gwangju ,  Jeolla  region (South Korea)         [ edit ]   Phonology       This article contains  IPA  phonetic symbols.  Without proper  rendering support , you may see  question marks, boxes, or other symbols  instead of  Unicode  characters.       Main article:  Korean phonology     [ edit ]   Consonants          The Korean consonants             Bilabial   Alveolar   Post-  alveolar   Velar   Glottal       Nasal      /m/      /n/        //  (syllable-final)         Plosive  and   Affricate   plain      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         tense      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         aspirated      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         Fricative   plain        /s/          /h/       tense        /s/             Liquid        /l/           The  IPA  symbol <  > (a subscript double straight quotation mark, shown here with a placeholder circle) is used to denote the tensed consonants  /p/, /t/, /k/, //, /s/ . Its official use in the  Extensions to the IPA  is for  'strong'  articulation, but is used in the literature for  faucalized voice . The Korean consonants also have elements of  stiff voice , but it is not yet known how typical this is of faucalized consonants. They are produced with a partially constricted  glottis  and additional subglottal pressure in addition to tense vocal tract walls, laryngeal lowering, or other expansion of the larynx.     [ edit ]   Vowels                    The Korean basic vowels                 Monophthongs   /i/    ,  /e/    ,  //    ,  /a/    ,  /o/    ,  /u/    ,  //    ,  //    ,  //          Vowels preceded by intermediaries,  or Diphthongs   /je/    ,  /j/    ,  /ja/    ,  /wi/    ,  /we/    ,  /w/    ,  /wa/    ,  /i/    ,  /jo/    ,  /ju/    ,  /j/    ,  /w/            [ edit ]   Allophones   /s/  becomes an  alveolo-palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i]  for most speakers (but see  Differences in the language between North Korea and South Korea ). This occurs with the tense fricative and all the affricates as well. At the end of a syllable, /s/ changes to /t/ (Example: beoseot () 'mushroom').   /h/  may become a  bilabial   []  before  [o]  or  [u] , a  palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i] , a  velar   [x]  before  [] , a voiced  []  between voiced sounds, and a  [h]  elsewhere. [ citation needed ]   /p, t, , k/  become voiced  [b, d, , ]  between voiced sounds.   /l/  becomes alveolar flap  []  between vowels, and  [l]  or  []  at the end of a syllable or next to another  /l/ . Note that a written syllable-final '', when followed by a vowel or a glide ( i.e. , when the next character starts with ''), migrates to the next syllable and thus becomes  [] .   Traditionally,  /l/  was disallowed at the beginning of a word. It disappeared before  [j] , and otherwise became  /n/ . However, the inflow of western loanword changed the trend, and now word-initial  /l/  (mostly from English loanwords) are pronounced as a free variation of either  []  or  [l] . The traditional prohibition of word-initial  /l/  became a morphological rule called ""initial law"" () in South Korea, which pertains to Sino-Korean vocabulary. Such words retain their word-initial  /l/  in North Korea.   All  obstruents  (plosives, affricates, fricatives) are  unreleased   [p, t, k]  at the end of a word.   Plosive stops  /p, t, k/  become nasal stops  [m, n, ]  before nasal stops.   Hangul  spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying, partly historical  morphology . Given this, it is sometimes hard to tell which actual phonemes are present in a certain word.   One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial  [r] , and initial  [n] . For example,     ""labour"" - north:  r odong  (), south:  n odong  ()   ""history"" - north:  ry ksa  (), south:  y eoksa  ()   ""female"" - north:  ny ja  (), south:  y eoja  ()       [ edit ]   Morphophonemics   Grammatical morphemes may change shape depending on the preceding sounds. Examples include  -eun/-neun  (-/-) and  -i/-ga  (-/-). Sometimes sounds may be inserted instead. Examples include  -eul/-reul  (-/-),  -euro/-ro  (-/-),  -eseo/-seo  (-/-),  -ideunji/-deunji  (-/-) and  -iya/-ya  (-/-). However,  -euro/-ro  is somewhat irregular, since it will behave differently after a rieul consonant.     Korean particles     After a consonant   After a rieul   After a vowel       -ui  (-)       -eun  (-)   -neun  (-)       -i  (-)   -ga  (-)       -eul  (-)   -reul  (-)       -gwa  (-)   -wa  (-)       -euro  (-)   -ro  (-)       Some verbs may also change shape morphophonemically.     [ edit ]   Grammar   Main article:  Korean grammar     [ edit ]   Sentence structure   Korean is an  agglutinative language . Modifiers generally follow the modified word, and in the case of verb modifiers, can be serially appended. The basic form of a Korean sentence is  Subject Object Verb , but the verb is the only required and immovable element.       A :       -       -? (?)           kage-e     kasseo-yo           store + [location marker ()]     [go (verb root) ()]+[conjunctive ()]+[past ()]+[conjunctive ()]+ [polite marker ()]         ""Did [you] go to the store?"" (with ""you"" implied by context)         B :       .           ye           yes         ""Yes.""       [ edit ]   Parts of speech     [ edit ]   Verb   Korean  verbs  (  ,  tongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""action verbs"" or ""dynamic verbs"" to distinguish them from [  () ,  hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""]), which are also known as ""descriptive verbs"" or ""stative verbs"". Examples of action/dynamic verbs include    ( hada , ""to do"") and    ( kada , ""to go"") which constitute an action or movement as opposed to descriptive verbs such as    ( yehppeuda , ""to be beautiful""). For a larger list of Korean verbs, see  wikt:Category:Korean verbs .   Unlike most of the European languages, Korean does not conjugate verbs using agreement with the subject, and nouns have no gender. Instead, verb conjugations depend upon the verb tense, aspect, mood, and the social relation between the speaker, the subjects, and the listeners. The system of speech levels and honorifics loosely resembles the  T-V distinction  of most  Indo-European languages . For example, different endings are used based on the speaker's relation with the person they are talking to or the person about which they are talking. Politeness is a critical part of Korean language and Korean culture, therefore, when talking to someone esteemed, the correct verb ending, which should have a lot of respect, must be chosen.     [ edit ]   Adjective   Words categorized as Korean  adjectives  (  ,  hyeong-yongsa ,   ) conjugate similarly to verbs, so some English texts call them ""descriptive verbs"" or "" stative verbs "", but they are distinctly separate from    ( tongsa ).   English does not have an identical grammatical category, so the English translation of Korean adjectives may misleadingly suggest that they are verbs. For example,    ( pukda ) translates literally as ""to be red"" and    ( aswipda ) often best translates as ""to lack"" or ""to want for"", but both are    ( hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""). For a larger list of Korean adjectives, see  wikt:Category:Korean adjectives .     [ edit ]   Determiner   Korean  determiners  (  ,  gwanhyeongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""determinatives"", ""adnominals"", ""pre-nouns"", ""attributives"", and ""unconjugated adjectives"". Examples include    ( kak , ""each""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean determiners .     [ edit ]   Noun   A large body of Korean  nouns  (  ,  myeongsa ,   ) stem from  Chinese characters , e.g.    (,  san , mountain),    (,  yeok , station),    (,  munhwa , culture), etc. Others are native to the Korean language, e.g.    ( nara , country),    ( nal , day). Many  Sino-Korean words  have a native Korean equivalent and vice versa, but not always. Nouns do not have  grammatical gender  and can be made  plural  by adding  to the end of the word, however in most instances the  singular  form is used even when in English it would be translated as plural. For example, while in English the sentence  ""there are three apples""  would use the plural  ""apples""  instead of the singular  ""apple"" , the Korean sentence    ( sagwa segae isssumnida ) maintains the word  ( sagwa , ""apple"") in its singular form, thus rendered in English as ""apple three(things) exist."" For a list of Korean nouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean nouns .     [ edit ]   Pronoun   Main article:  Korean pronouns   Korean  pronouns  (  ,  daemyeongsa ,   ) are highly influenced by the honorifics in the language. Pronouns change forms depending on the social status of the person or persons spoken to, e.g. the pronoun for ""I"" there is both the informal    ( na ) and the honorific/humble    ( jeo ). In general second person singular pronouns are avoided, especially when using honorific forms. For a larger list or Korean pronouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean pronouns .     [ edit ]   Adverb   Korean  adverbs  (  ,  busa ,   ) include    ( tto , ""also"") and    ( gadeuk , ""fully""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean adverbs .     [ edit ]   Particle   Korean  particles  (  ,  josa ,   ) are also known in English as "" postpositions "". Examples include    ( neun , topic marker) and    ( reul , object marker). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean particles .     [ edit ]   Interjection   Korean  interjections  (  ,  gamtansa ,   ) are also known in English as ""exclamations"". Examples include    ( ani , ""no""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean interjections .     [ edit ]   Number   Main article:  Korean numerals   Korean  numbers  or numerals (  ,  sutja ,   ) consitute two regularly used sets: a native Korean set and a  Sino-Korean  set. The Sino-Korean system is nearly entirely based on the  Chinese numerals . The distinction between the two numeral systems is very important. Everything that can be counted will use one of the two systems, but seldom both. Sino-Korean words are sometimes used to mark ordinal usage: yeol beon ( ) means ""ten times"" while sip beon (() ()) means ""number ten."" The grouping of large numbers in Korean follow the Chinese tradition of myriads (10000) rather than thousands (1000) as is common in Europe and North America.     [ edit ]   Speech levels and honorifics   Main article:  Korean honorifics   The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean, and the grammar reflects this. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject referent is reflected in  honorifics , while that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in  speech level .     [ edit ]   Honorifics   When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a younger stranger, student, employee or the like. Nowadays, there are special endings which can be used on declarative, interrogative, and imperative sentences; and both honorific or normal sentences. They are made for easier and faster use of Korean.     [ edit ]   Speech levels   There are seven verb  paradigms  or  speech levels  in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation. [ citation needed ]  Unlike  honorifics   which are used to show respect towards the referent   speech levels  are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience. The names of the 7 levels are derived from the non-honorific  imperative  form of the verb    ( hada , ""do"") in each level, plus the suffix  ('che',  hanja :   ), which means ""style.""   The highest 6 levels are generally grouped together as  jondaenmal  (), while the lowest level ( haeche , ) is called  banmal  () in Korean.     [ edit ]   Vocabulary   The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words. Like Japanese and Vietnamese, more than 50% of the vocabulary (up to 60% by some estimates), especially words that denote abstract ideas, are  Sino-Korean words , [ 7 ]  either     directly borrowed from  Written Chinese , or   coined in Japan or Korea using  Chinese characters ,     in a similar way European languages borrow from Latin and Greek. Korean has two  number systems : one native, and one borrowed from Chinese.   To a much lesser extent, words have also occasionally been borrowed from  Mongolian ,  Sanskrit , and other languages. Conversely, the Korean language itself has also contributed some loanwords to other languages, most notably the  Tsushima dialect  of Japanese.   The vast majority of loanwords other than Sino-Korean come from modern times, 90% of which are from  English . [ 8 ]  Many words have also been borrowed from  Japanese  and  Western languages  such as  German  ( areubaiteu  part-time job,  allereugi  allergy). Some Western words were borrowed indirectly via Japanese, taking a Japanese sound pattern, for example dozen >     dsu  >     daseu . Most indirect Western borrowings are now written according to current Hangulization rules for the respective Western language, as if borrowed directly. There are a few more complicated borrowings such as German(y) (see  Names for Germany ), the first part of whose  endonym   [d.lant]  the Japanese approximated using the  kanji      doitsu  that were then accepted into the Korean language by their Sino-Korean pronunciation:     dok  +     il  =  Dogil . In South Korean official use, a number of other Sino-Korean country names have been replaced with phonetically oriented Hangulizations of the countries' endonyms or English names.   North Korean vocabulary shows a tendency to prefer native Korean over Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings, especially with recent political objectives aimed at eliminating foreign (mostly Chinese) influences on the Korean language in the North. By contrast, South Korean may have several Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings which tend to be absent in North Korean.     [ edit ]   Writing system       Korean writing systems           Hangul       Hanja       Hyangchal   Gugyeol   Idu       Mixed script       Korean romanization       Revised Romanization of Korean   McCune-Reischauer   Yale Romanization           Main article:  Hangul   See also:  Hangul consonant and vowel tables   In ancient times, the languages of the Korean peninsula were written using  Chinese characters , using  hyangchal  or  idu . Such systems were not popular because hanja is not well suited to the Korean language. Its use is now limited.   Korean is now mainly written in Hangul, the Korean alphabet promulgated in 1446 by  Sejong the Great ;  hanja may be mixed in  to write  Sino-Korean words . South Korea still teaches 1800 hanja characters in its schools, while the North abolished the use of hanja decades ago.   Below is a chart of the Korean alphabet's symbols and their canonical  IPA  values:     Consonants     Hangul                                                                        RR   b , p   d , t   j   g , k   pp   tt   jj   kk   p   t   ch   k   s   h   ss   m   n   ng       r , l           IPA   p   t      k   p   t      k   p   t      k   s   h   s   m   n      w   r   j         Vowels     Hangul                                                                      RR   i   e   oe   ae   a   o   u   eo   eu   ui   ye   yae   ya   yo   yu   yeo   wi   we   wae   wa   wo       IPA   i   e         a   o   u         i   je   j   ja   jo   ju   j   wi   we   w   wa   w       Modern Korean is written with  spaces  between  words , a feature not found in Chinese or Japanese. Korean  punctuation  marks are almost identical to Western ones. Traditionally, Korean was written in columns from top to bottom, right to left, but is now usually written in rows from left to right, top to bottom.     [ edit ]   Differences between North Korean and South Korean   Main article:  Korean language North-South differences   The Korean language used in the North and the South exhibits differences in pronunciation, spelling, grammar and vocabulary. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Pronunciation   In North Korea,  palatalization  of  /si/  is optional, and  //  can be pronounced as  [z]  in between vowels.   Words that are written the same way may be pronounced differently, such as the examples below. The pronunciations below are given in  Revised Romanization ,  McCune-Reischauer  and Hangul, the last of which represents what the Hangul would be if one writes the word as pronounced.       Word   Meaning   Pronunciation       North (RR/MR)   North (Hangul)   South (RR/MR)   South (Hangul)          wide   neo p tta (n p ta)      neo l tta (n l ta)             to read  (continuative form)   i l kko (i l ko)      i l kko (i l ko)             Amnok River   am r okgang (am r okkang)      am n okkang (am n okkang)             independence   dong r ip (tong r ip)      dong n ip (tong n ip)             idea / sense / conception   gwa ll yeom (kwa ll ym)      gwa nn yeom (kwa nn ym)          *   innovative   hyeoksin jj eok (hyksin tch k)      hyeoksin j eok (hyksin j k)          * Similar pronunciation is used in the North whenever the hanja """" is attached to a Sino-Korean word ending in ,  or . (In the South, this rule only applies when it is attached to any single-character Sino-Korean word.)     [ edit ]   Spelling   Some words are spelled differently by the North and the South, but the pronunciations are the same.       Word spelling   Meaning   Pronunciation (RR/MR)   Remarks       North   South             sunshine   haeppit (haepit)   The ""sai siot"" ('' used for indicating sound change) is almost never written out in the North.             cherry blossom   beotkkot (ptkkot)                cannot read   monnikda (monnikta)   Spacing.             Hallasan   hallasan (hallasan)   When a - combination is pronounced as  ll , the original Hangul spelling is kept in the North, while the Hangul is changed in the South.             rules   gyuyul (kyuyul)   In words where the original hanja is spelt """" or """" and follows a vowel, the initial  is not pronounced in the North, making the pronunciation identical with that in the South where the  is dropped in the spelling.         [ edit ]   Spelling and pronunciation   Some words have different spellings and pronunciations in the North and the South, some of which were given in the ""Phonology"" section above:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          ryeongryang (ryngryang)      yeongnyang (yngnyang)   strength   Korean words originally starting in  r  or  n  have their  r  or  n  dropped in the South Korean version if the sound following it is an  i  or  y  sound.          rodong (rodong)      nodong (nodong)   work   Korean words originally starting in  r  have their  r  changed to  n  in the South Korean version if the sound following it is a sound other than  i  or  y .          wonssu (wnssu)      wonsu (wnsu)   mortal enemy   ""Mortal enemy"" and ""head of state"" are homophones in the South. Possibly to avoid referring to  Kim Il-sung  /  Kim Jong-il  as the enemy, the second syllable of ""enemy"" is written and pronounced  in the North.          rajio (rajio)      radio (radio)   radio            u (u)      wi (wi)   on; above            anhae (anhae)      anae (anae)   wife            kkuba (kkuba)      kuba (k'uba)   Cuba   When transcribing foreign words from languages that do not have contrasts between aspirated and unaspirated stops, North Koreans generally use tensed stops for the unaspirated ones while South Koreans use aspirated stops in both cases.          pe (p'e)      pye (p'ye), pe (p'e)   lungs   All hanja pronounced as  pye  ( p'ye ) or  pe  ( p'e ) in the South are pronounced as  pe  ( p'e ) in the North. The spelling is also accordingly different.       In general, when transcribing place names, North Korea tends to use the pronunciation in the original language more than South Korea, which often uses the pronunciation in English. For example:       Original name   North Korea transliteration   English name   South Korea transliteration       Spelling   Pronunciation   Spelling   Pronunciaton       Ulaanbaatar      ullanbattareu (ullanbattar)   Ulan Bator      ullanbatoreu (ullanbat'or)       Kbenhavn      koeppenhabeun (k'oeppenhabn)   Copenhagen      kopenhagen (k'op'enhagen)       al-Qhirah      kkahira (kkahira)   Cairo      kairo (k'airo)         [ edit ]   Grammar   Some grammatical constructions are also different:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          doeyeotda (toeytta)      doeeotda (toetta)   past tense of  (doeda/toeda), ""to become""   All similar grammar forms of verbs or adjectives that end in  in the stem (i.e. , , , ,  and ) in the North use  instead of the South's .          gomawayo (komawayo)      gomawoyo (komawyo)   thanks   -irregular verbs in the North use  (wa) for all those with a positive ending vowel; this only happens in the South if the verb stem has only one syllable.          halgayo (halkayo)      halkkayo (halkkayo)   Shall we do?   Although the Hangul differ, the pronunciations are the same (i.e. with the tensed  sound).         [ edit ]   Vocabulary   Some vocabulary is different between the North and the South:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          munhwajutaek (munhwajut'aek)      apateu (ap'at')   Apartment     (appateu/appat') is also used in the North.          joseonmal (chosnmal)      han-gugeo(han'gugeo)   Korean language            gwakbap (kwakpap)      dosirak (tosirak)   lunch box           [ edit ]   Others   In the North,  guillemets     and    are the symbols used for quotes; in the South, quotation marks equivalent to the English ones,  and , are standard, although     and     are sometimes used in popular novels.     [ edit ]   Study by non-native speakers   The  United States '  Defense Language Institute  classifies Korean alongside  Arabic ,  Chinese , and  Japanese  as a Category IV language, meaning that 63 weeks of instruction (as compared to just 25 weeks for  French ,  Spanish ,  Portuguese , and  Italian ) are required to bring an English-speaking student to a limited working level of proficiency in which he or she has ""sufficient capability to meet routine social demands and limited job requirements"" and ""can deal with concrete topics in past, present, and future tense."" [ 10 ]  As a result, the study of the Korean language in the United States is dominated by  Korean American  heritage language students; they are estimated to form over 80% of all students of the language at non-military universities. [ 11 ]   However, Korean is considerably easier for speakers of certain other languages, such as Japanese, Mongolian and Turkic languages; in Japan, it is more widely studied by non-heritage learners. [ 12 ]  The  Korean Language Proficiency Test , an examination aimed at assessing non-native speakers' competence in Korean, was instituted in 1997; 17,000 people applied for the 2005 sitting of the examination.

The language is also spoken widely in neighbouring  Yanbian ,  China .  Worldwide, there are around 78 million Korean speakers, including large groups in the former  Soviet Union ,  Australia , the  United States ,  Canada ,  Brazil ,  Japan , and more recently the  Philippines . The language is strongly associated with the  Korean people .   The genealogical  classification  of Korean is debated. It is sometimes placed by linguists in the  Altaic  language family, though others considered it to be a  language isolate . Korean is  agglutinative  in its morphology and  SOV  in its syntax.  This article is mainly about the spoken Korean language.  See  Hangul  for details on the native Korean writing system.

In North Korea, the language is most often called  ChosOnmal  (p ), or more formally,  ChosOnO  (p ).  In South Korea, the language is most often called  Hangungmal  (\m), or more formally,  Hangugeo  (\m) or  Gugeo  (m, National Language).  It is sometimes colloquially called  Urimal  (, ""Our Language"").    [ edit ] Classification and related languages   Korean classification is often debated. Many Korean and Western linguists recognize a kinship to the  Altaic languages . However, this is not well demonstrated, and many consider Korean a  language isolate . Others believe that  Japanese  and Korean may be related.  The Korean relationship with  Altaic  and proto-Altaic have been much argued as of late. Korean is similar to Altaic languages in that they both have the absence of certain grammatical elements, including  number ,  gender ,  articles , fusional morphology, voice, and  relative pronouns  (Kim Namkil). Korean especially bears some  morphological  resemblance to some languages of the Eastern Turkic group, namely  Yakut .  The possibility of a Korean-Japanese linguistic relationship is a delicate subject because of the complex historical relationship between the two countries.  The possibility of a  Baekje -Japanese linguistic relationship has been studied, with Korean linguists pointing out similarities in  phonology , including a general lack consonant-final sounds. There are plenty of apparent  cognates  between Baekje and Japanese, such as  mir  and  mi,  respectively, for ""three"". Furthermore, there are cultural links between Baekje and Japan: the people of Baekje used two Chinese characters for their surnames, like the people of Japan today.   Goguryeo and Baekje languages are considered related, likely descended from  Go-Joseon . (See  Fuyu languages .) Less is known about the relationship between the languages of Go-Joseon, Goguryo, and Baekje on one hand, and the  Samhan  and  Silla  on the other, although many Korean scholars believe they were mutually intelligable, and the collective basis of modern Korean.    [ edit ] Geographic distribution   Most of the speakers of the Korean language live in  North  and  South Korea . However, there are some ethnic Koreans in  China ,  Australia , the former  Soviet Union ,  Japan ,  Brazil ,  Canada  and the  United States .    [ edit ] Dialects   Main article:  Dialects of Korean     Korean has several  dialects  (called  mal  (literally speech),  bang-eon , or  saturi  in Korean). The  standard language  ( Pyojuneo  or  Pyojunmal ) of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  P'yOngyang . These dialects are similar, and in fact all dialects except that of  Jeju  Island are largely mutually intelligible. The dialect spoken there is classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of  Seoul Dialect  use stress very little, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of  Gyeongsang Dialect  have a very pronounced intonation that makes their dialect sound more like a European language to western ears.  There is a very close connection between the dialects of Korean and the  regions of Korea , since the boundaries of both are largely determined by mountains and seas.  Here is a list of traditional dialect names and locations:          Standard Dialect     Where Used         Seoul     Seoul ,  Incheon ,  Gyeonggi  ( South Korea );  Kaesŏng  ( North Korea )        P'yOngan     P'yOngyang ,  P'yOngan  region,  Chagang  (North Korea)        Regional Dialect     Where Used         Chungcheong     Daejeon ,  Chungcheong  region (South Korea)        Gangwon     Gangwon  (South Korea)/ Kangwŏn  (North Korea)        Gyeongsang     Busan ,  Daegu ,  Ulsan ,  Gyeongsang  region (South Korea)        HamgyOng     RasOn ,  HamgyOng  region,  Ryanggang  (North Korea)        Hwanghae     Hwanghae  region (North Korea)        Jeju     Jeju  Island/Province (South Korea)        Jeolla     Gwangju ,  Jeolla  region (South Korea)    [ edit ] Sounds         Note : This page contains IPA   phonetic  symbols in  Unicode .

Its official IPA usage is for  voiced  consonants, which the tensed stops in Korean are not. The use of this diacritic along with the symbols for voiced consonants indicates that the glottal constriction is greater than that found in modal voicing. This is called  stiff voice . The Korean tensed stops are produced with a partially constricted  glottis  and additional subglottal pressure, elements of stiff voice, which is how they are sometimes analysed.   Sometimes the tense consonants are indicated with the apostrophe-like symbol <  >, but this is inappropriate, as IPA <  > represents the  ejective  consonants, with their glottal movement and non-pulmonic air pressure, which the Korean tense consonants do not have.   There is ongoing debate as to whether the ""tense"" consonants are  fortis or lenis , partially because those are poorly defined terms, and much of the academic literature is in a state of confusion.    [ edit ] Vowels         Image:Korean short vowel chart.png     Image:Korean long vowel chart.png     [ edit ] Monophthongs   Korean has 8 different vowel qualities and a length distinction. Two more vowels, the close-mid front rounded vowel  //  and the close front rounded vowel  /y/ , can still be heard in the speech of some older speakers, but they have been largely replaced by the diphthongs  [we]  and  [wi]  respectively. In a 2003 survey of 350 speakers from Seoul, nearly 90% pronounced the vowel '_' as  [wi] . Length distinction is also decreasing; length distinction for all vowels can still be heard from older speakers, but many younger speakers do not always distinguish lengths consistently. The distinction between  /e/  and  /[/  is another decreasing element in the speech of younger speakers, except when enunciated carefully.  [e]  seems to be the dominant form. Long  //  is actually  [Y]  for most speakers.          i     [UidaK]     sijang    'hunger'    i     [UidaK]     sijang    'market'      e     [pea[]     begae    'pillow'    e     [peda]     beda    'cut'      [     [t[jaK]     taeyang    'sun'    [     [t[do]     taedo    'attitude'      a     [mal]     mal    'horse'    a     [mal]     mal    'speech'      o     [po~i]     bori    'barley'    o     [posu]     bosu    'salary'      u     [ku~i]     guri    'copper'    u     [subak]     subak    'watermelon'           [pl]     beol    'punishment'    Y     [pYl]     beol    'bee'      o     [Y~on]     eoreun    'seniors'    o     [omUik]     eumsik    'food'    [ edit ] Diphthongs and glides   /j/  and  /w/  are considered to be components of diphthongs rather than separate consonant phonemes.                          wi     [twi]     dwi    'back'    oi     [oisa]     uisa    'doctor'        je     [jesan]     yesan    'budget'    we     [kwe]     gwe    'box'                        j[     [j[gi]     yaegi    'story'    w[     [w[]     wae    'why'                        ja     [jagu]     yagu    'baseball'    wa     [kwail]     gwail    'fruits'                        jo     [kjoːsa]     gyosa    'teacher'                                        ju     [ju~i]     yuri    'glass'                                        jY     [jYgi]     yeogi    'here'    w     [mw]     mwo    'what'                    Source:  Handbook of the International Phonetic Association     [ edit ] Phonology   /s/  becomes an  alveolo-palatal   [U]  before  [j]  or  [i] . This occurs with the tense fricative and all the affricates as well.   /h/  becomes a  bilabial   [x]  before  [o]  or  [u] , a  palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i] , a  velar   [x]  before  [o] , a voiced  [f]  between voiced sounds, and a  [h]  elsewhere.   /p, t, t, k/  become voiced  [b, d, d, a]  between voiced sounds.  /l/  becomes alveolar flap  [~]  between vowels,  [l]  or  [m]  at the end of a syllable or next to another  /l/ , disappears at the beginning of a word before  [j]  in normal speech, and otherwise becomes  [n]  in normal speech.  All  obstruents  (plosives, affricates, fricatives) are  unreleased   [p, t, k]  at the end of a word.   Plosive stops  /p, t, k/  become nasal stops  [m, n, K]  before nasal stops.   Some of these phonetic  assimilation  rules can be seen in the following:      /toKlo/  is pronounced as  [toK.no]     /hankukmal/  as  [han.guK.mal]     Hangul  spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying  morphology .   One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial  [r] , and initial  [n]  before  [i]  or  [y] . For example,     ""labour"" - north:  r odong  (\), south:  n odong  (x)   ""history"" - north:  ry Oksa  (%), south:  y eoksa  ()   ""lady"" - north:  ny Oja  (@), south:  y eoja  ()    [ edit ] Vowel harmony         Korean Vowel Harmony       Positive/Yang Vowels   O (a)   Q (ya)   W (o)   [ (yo)         P (ae)   X (wa)   Z (oe)   Y (wae)       Negative/Yin Vowels   S (eo)   U (yeo)   \ (u)   ` (yu)         T (e)   ] (wo)   _ (wi)   ^ (we)       Neutral/Centre Vowels   a (eu)   c (i)   b (ui)      Traditionally, the Korean language has had strong  vowel harmony ; that is, in pre-modern Korean, as in most Altaic languages, not only did the inflectional and derivational affixes (such as  postpositions ) change in accordance to the main root vowel, but native words also adhered to vowel harmony.  It is not as prevalent in modern usage, although it remains strong in  onomatopoeia ,  adjectives  and  adverbs ,  interjections , and  conjugation . There are also other traces of vowel harmony in Korean.   There are three classes of vowels in Korean: positive, negative, and neutral. The vowel ŭ is considered partially a neutral and negative vowel. The vowel classes loosely follow the mid (negative) and front (positive) vowels; they also follow orthography. Exchanging positive vowels with negative vowels usually creates different nuances of meaning, with positive vowels sounding diminuitive and negative vowels sounding crude.   Some examples:    Onomatopoeia:     (pongdangpongdang) and ii (pungdeongpungdeong), water splashing    Adjectives/Adverbs:    }} (morangmorak) and 44 (mureongmureok) can both be translated as ""rapidly"" or ""densely"", but they are not interchangeable:   0 }} . (( yeongiga morangmorak nanda ) Smoke rises up.   4 44 . (( Namuga mureongmureok jaranda ) The tree grows well.       Emphasised Adjectives:    x (norata) means plain yellow, while its negative,  (nureota) means very yellow    (parata) means plain blue, while its negative, | (peoreota) means deep blue    Particles at the end of verbs:     (Japda) (to catch) → X (Jabatda) (caught)    (Jeopda) (to fold) →  (Jeobeotda) (folded)    Interjections:    Dt (Aigo) and tl (Eoigu) meaning ""oh my!""   DX (Aha) and  (Eoheo) meaning ""indeed"" and ""well"" respectively      [ edit ] Grammar   Korean is an  agglutinative language . The basic form of a Korean sentence is Subject-Object-Verb ( SOV ), and modifiers precede the modified word. As a side note, a sentence can break the SOV word order, however, it must end with the verb.  In contrast to the Korean word order, in English, one would say, ""I'm going to the store to buy some food,"" in Korean it would be: *""I food to-buy in-order-to store-to going-am.""  In Korean, ""unnecessary"" words (see  theme and rheme ) can be left out of a sentence as long as the context makes the meaning clear. A typical exchange might translate word-for word to the following:    H: "" 8?"" ( ( gage-e gaseyo? )  G: ""."" ( ye. )      H: *""store-to going?""  G: ""yes.""      which in English would translate to:    H: ""Going to the store?""  G: ""Yes.""      Unlike most European languages, Korean does not conjugate verbs using agreement with the subject, and nouns have no gender. Instead, verb conjugations depend upon the verb tense and on the relation between the people speaking. When talking to or about friends, you would use one conjugate ending, to your parents, another, and to nobility/honoured persons, another. This loosely echoes the  T-V distinction  of most  Indo-European languages .    [ edit ]  Speech levels and honorifics    The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean, and the grammar reflects this. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject is reflected in  honorifics , while that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in  speech level .    [ edit ] Honorifics   When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer has to use special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a younger stranger, student, employee or the like. On rare occasions (like when someone wants to pick a fight), a speaker might speak to a superior or stranger in a way normally only used for, say, animals, but no one would do this without seriously considering the consequences to their physical safety first!  One way of using honorifics is to use  special nouns  in place of regular nouns with ""honorific"" ones. A common example is using  ( jinji ) instead of % ( bap ) for ""food"". More often, special nouns are used when speaking about relatives. Thus, the speaker/writer may address his own grandmother as `8 ( halmeoni ) but refer to someone else's grandmother as `8 ( halmeonim ). The honorific suffix - ( -nim ) is affixed to many kinship terms to make them honorific; thus,  ( hyeongnim ) is the formal term for an older sibling of the same sex (derived from  ( hyeong, ) the informal term for man's older brother;  ( eonni ) is the informal term for a woman's older sister).  All verbs can be converted into an honorific form by adding the infix -- ( -si- , pronounced  shi ) after the  stem  and before the verb  ending . Thus,  (( gada , ""go"") becomes  (( gasida ). A few verbs have special honorific equivalents. Therefore  ( gyesida ) is the honorific form of  ( itda , ""exist"");  ( deusida ) and  ( japsusida ) is the honorific form of 9 ( meokda , ""eat""); and 4 ( jumushida ) is the honorific form of  ( jada , ""sleep"").  A few verbs have special humble forms, used when the speaker is referring to him/herself in polite situations. These include ܬ ( deurida ) and , ( ollida ) for  ( juda , ""give"").  Deurida  is substituted for  juda  when the latter is used as an  auxiliary  verb, while  ollida  — which literally means ""raise up"" — is used for  juda  in the sense of ""offer"".  Pronouns in Korean  have their own set of polite equivalents: thus,  (( jeo ) is the humble form of  ( na , ""I""); l (( jeoheui ) is the humble form of  ( uri , ""we""); and  ( dangshin , ""friend,"" but only used as a form of address and more polite than ""chingu"", the usual word for ""friend""; also, whereas uses of other humble forms are straightforward, ""dangsin"" must be used only in specific social contexts, such as between two married couple — ""dangsin"" can often be used in ironic sense when used between strangers) is the honorific form of  ( neo , ""you"" (singular). Note: in general, Koreans avoid using second person singular pronoun, especially when using honorific forms, and either i) use the person's name,  kinship term , or title in place of ""you"" in English, ii) use plural   yeoreobun  where applicable, or iii) avoid using a pronoun, relying on context to supply meaning instead).    [ edit ] Speech levels   There are no fewer than 7 verb  paradigms  or  speech levels  in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation. Unlike ""honorifics"" — which are used to show respect towards a subject —  speech levels  are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience. The names of the 7 levels are derived from the non-honorific  imperative  form of the verb X ( hada , ""do"") in each level, plus the suffix  ('che'), which means ""style.""  The highest 5 levels use  final  verb  endings , while the lowest 2 levels (t  haeyoche  and t  haeche ) use  non-final   endings  and are called  ( banmal , ""half-words"") in Korean. (The  haeyoche  in turn is formed by simply adding the non-final ending - ( -yo ) to the  haeche  form of the verb.)  Taken together, honorifics and speech levels form a  cartesian product  of 14 basic verb stems. Here is a table giving the 7 levels, the  present   indicative  form of the verb X ( hada , ""do"" in English) in each level in both its honorific and non-honorific forms, and the situations in which each level is used.

Haeyoche (t)   haeyo (t)   haseyo (X8) (common), hasheoyo (XT) (rare)   Informal and polite   Used mainly between strangers, especially those older or of equal age.

Haeche (t)   hae (t) (in speech), hayeo (X) (in writing)   hasheo(XT)    Informal, of neutral politeness or impolite   Used most often between close friends and relatives, and when addressing younger people. It is  never  used between strangers unless the speaker wants to pick a fight.    [ edit ] Vocabulary   The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words. More than 50% of the vocabulary, however, is made up of  Sino-Korean  words, which are words borrowed from  Chinese . To a much lesser extent, words have also been borrowed from  Mongolian ,  Sanskrit , and other languages. In modern times, many words have also been borrowed from  Western languages  such as  German  and, more recently,  English .  The numbers are a good example of borrowing. Like  Japanese , Korean has two number systems — one native and one borrowed from the Chinese — so Korean, Chinese and Japanese all appear to have similar words for numbers.    [ edit ] Writing system   Main article:  Hangul     The Korean language was originally written using "" Hanja "", or  Chinese characters ; it is now mainly written in  Hangul , the Korean alphabet, optionally mixing in Hanja to write  Sino-Korean  words. South Korea still teaches 1800 Hanja characters to its children, while the North has abolished the use of hanja decades ago.   Hangul consists of 24 letters — 14 consonants and 10 vowels that are written in syllabic blocks of 2 to 5 components. Unlike the  Chinese  writing system (including  Japanese   Kanji ), Hangul is not an  ideographic  system.  Below is a chart of the Korean alphabet's symbols and their canonical  IPA  values:       Consonants        IPA     p     t     c     k     b,     d,     _,     a,     p     t     c     k     s     h     z,     m     n     K     w     r     j         Hangul    B   7   H   1   C   8   I   2   M   L   J   K   E   N   F   A   4   G       9           Vowels        IPA     i     e     [     a     o     u          o     oi     je     j[     ja     jo     ju     j     wi     we     w[     wa     w         Hangul    c   T   P   O   W   \   S   a   b   V   R   Q   [   `   U   _   ^   Y   X   ]    See also:  Hangul consonant and vowel tables   Modern Korean is written with  spaces  between  words , a feature not found in Chinese and Japanese. Korean  punctuation  marks are almost identical to Western ones. Traditionally, Korean was written in columns from top to bottom, right to left, but is now usually written in rows from left to right, top to bottom.    [ edit ] Differences in the language between North Korea and South Korea   The Korean language used in the North and the South exhibits differences in pronunciation, spelling, grammar and vocabulary.    [ edit ] Pronunciation   In North Korea, palatization of  /si/  is optional, and  /t/  can be pronounced as  [z]  in between vowels.  Words that are written the same way may be pronounced differently, such as the examples below.  The pronunciations below are given in  Revised Romanization ,  McCune-Reischauer  and Hangul, the last of which represents what the Hangul would be if one writes the word as pronounced.

In the 15th century a national writing system was developed by  Sejong the Great , nowadays called  Hangul .   The genealogical  classification  of the Korean language is debated.

In South Korea, the language is most often called  Hangungmal  (  ;   ), or more formally,  Hangugeo  (  ;   ) or  Gugeo  (  ;   ; literally ""national language"").   In North Korea and Yanbian in China, the language is most often called  Chosnmal  (  ; with  hanja :   ), or more formally,  Chosn  (  ;   ).   On the other hand, Korean people in the  former USSR , who refer to themselves as  Koryo-saram  (also  Goryeoin  [  ;   ; literally, "" Goryeo  person(s)""]) call the language  Goryeomal  (  ;   ).   In  mainland China , following the establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992, the term  Choxiny  (   or short form:  Choy  (  )) has normally been used to refer to the language spoken in North Korea and Yanbian, while  Hnguy  (   or short form:  Hny  (  )) is used to refer to the language spoken in South Korea.   Some older English sources also used the name ""Korean"" to refer to the language, country, and people.     [ edit ]   History       Main article:  History of the Korean language       Korean is descended from  Old Korean  and  Middle Korean .     [ edit ]   Classification   The classification of the modern Korean language is uncertain, and due to the lack of any one generally accepted theory, it is sometimes described conservatively as a  language isolate .   On the other hand, since the publication of the article of  Ramstedt  in 1926, many linguists support the hypothesis that Korean can be classified as an  Altaic  language, or as a relative of proto-Altaic. Korean is similar to Altaic languages in that they both lack certain grammatical elements, including  number ,  gender ,  articles , fusional morphology, voice, and  relative pronouns  (Kim Namkil). Korean especially bears some  morphological  resemblance to some languages of the Northern Turkic group, namely  Sakha (Yakut) . Vinokurova, a scholar of the Sakha language, noted that like in Korean, and unlike in other  Turkic languages  or a variety of other languages surveyed, adverbs in Sakha are derived from verbs with the help of derivational morphology; however, she did not suggest this implied any relation between the two languages. [ 2 ]   It is also considered likely that Korean is related in some way to  Japanese , since the two languages have nearly identical grammatical structures, and share a number of possible phonological cognates (though a majority of them are likely due to local pronunciations of the Chinese characters from which they are derived), as noted by such researchers as  Samuel E. Martin  and  Roy Andrew Miller  in the late 1960s.  Sergei Starostin  (1991) found about 25% of potential cognates in the Japanese-Korean 100-word  Swadesh list , which places these two languages closer together than other possible members of the Altaic family. [ 3 ]   Genetic relationships have been postulated both directly and indirectly, the latter either through placing both languages in the Altaic family, or by arguing for a relationship between Japanese and the  Buyeo languages  of  Goguryeo  and  Baekje  (see below); the proposed Baekje relationship is supported by cognates such as Baekje  mir , Japanese  mi-  ""three"". [ 4 ]   The possible relationship between Korean and Japanese can be exemplified by such basic vocabularly items as J.     mizu  (Old J.  midu ) : K.     mul  (Middle K.  mirh ) ""water"",  mot  ""lake""; J.     ku-ru  ""come"" (Old J.  ku , also cf. irregular root changes as in past tense   ki-ta , negative   ko-nai  in Modern J.) : K.     ka-da  (""go""); J.     kata-i  ""hard"" (whence     kata-na  ""knife, sword"") : K.  kud-yn  (hard); J.     i-ru  ""to be"" (past tense   i-ta ) : K.     i-da  ""to be""; J.  na ,  -en  : K.  anh  ""not"", J.  minna  (Old J.  mynna ) ""all, everyone"" : K.  manh-  ""many"" (predicate  mana-da ), etc.  [ 5 ] . The same possible cognates are often observed in other members of the potential  Altaic family , esp. in the  Tungusic languages . Cf. Nanay  mue  ""water"",  giagda-  ""to walk"",  anaa, anna  ""not"".   Others argue, however, that the similarities are not due to any genetic relationship, but rather to a  sprachbund  effect. See  East Asian languages  for morphological features shared among languages of the East Asian  sprachbund , and  Japanese language classification  for further details on the possible relationship.   It is presumed that modern Korean may be more closely related to the languages of  Samhan  and  Silla  than the Buyeo languages; many Korean scholars believe they were mutually intelligible, and the collective basis of what in the  Goryeo  period would merge to become Middle Korean (the language before the changes that the  Seven-Year War  brought) and eventually Modern Korean. The  Jeju dialect  preserves some archaic features that can also be found in Middle Korean, whose  arae a  is retained in the dialect as a distinct vowel.   There are also more marginal hypotheses proposing various other relationships; for example, a few scholars, such as  Homer B. Hulbert  (1905), have tried to relate Korean to the  Dravidian languages  through the similar syntax in both. [ 6 ]   Though not related to Chinese, it has borrowed heavily; see the Vocabulary section below.     [ edit ]   Dialects       Main article:  Korean dialects              Dialects of Korean       Korean has several  dialects  (called  mal  [literally ""speech""],  saturi , or  bang-eon  in Korean). The  standard language  ( pyojuneo  or  pyojunmal ) of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  P'yngyang . These dialects are similar, and are in fact all mutually intelligible, perhaps with the exception of the dialect of  Jeju Island  (see  Jeju dialect ). The dialect spoken in Jeju is in fact classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of  Seoul dialect  use very little stress, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of the  Gyeongsang dialect  have a very pronounced intonation.   It is also worth noting that there is substantial evidence for a history of extensive  dialect levelling , or even  convergent evolution  or intermixture of two or more originally distinct linguistic stocks, within the Korean language and its dialects. Many Korean dialects have basic vocabulary that is etymologically distinct from vocabulary of identical meaning in Standard Korean or other dialects, such as South Jeolla dialect /kur/ vs. Standard Korean     /ip/  ""mouth"" or Gyeongsang dialect  /.u.i/  vs. Standard Korean  /puu/  "" garlic chives ."" This suggests that the Korean Peninsula may have at one time been much more linguistically diverse than it is at present. [ citation needed ]  See also the  Buyeo languages   hypothesis .   There is a very close connection between the dialects of Korean and the  regions of Korea , since the boundaries of both are largely determined by mountains and seas. Here is a list of traditional dialect names and locations:       Standard dialect   Where used       Seoul   Seoul  (),  Incheon  (/), most of  Gyeonggi  (/)       P'yngan  (/)   P'yngyang ,  P'yngan  region,  Chagang  (North Korea)       Regional dialect   Where used       Gyeonggi   limited areas of the  Gyeonggi  region (South Korea)       Chungcheong   Daejeon ,  Chungcheong  region (South Korea)       Gangwon   Gangwon-do (South Korea) / Kangwn (North Korea)       Gyeongsang   Busan ,  Daegu ,  Ulsan ,  Gyeongsang  region (South Korea)       Hamgyng   Rasn ,  Hamgyng  region,  Ryanggang  (North Korea)       Hwanghae   Hwanghae  region (North Korea)       Jeju   Jeju Island/Province  (South Korea)       Jeolla   Gwangju ,  Jeolla  region (South Korea)         [ edit ]   Phonology       This article contains  IPA  phonetic symbols.

Its official use in the  Extensions to the IPA  is for  'strong'  articulation, but is used in the literature for  faucalized voice . The Korean consonants also have elements of  stiff voice , but it is not yet known how typical this is of faucalized consonants. They are produced with a partially constricted  glottis  and additional subglottal pressure in addition to tense vocal tract walls, laryngeal lowering, or other expansion of the larynx.     [ edit ]   Vowels                    The Korean basic vowels                 Monophthongs   /i/    ,  /e/    ,  //    ,  /a/    ,  /o/    ,  /u/    ,  //    ,  //    ,  //          Vowels preceded by intermediaries,  or Diphthongs   /je/    ,  /j/    ,  /ja/    ,  /wi/    ,  /we/    ,  /w/    ,  /wa/    ,  /i/    ,  /jo/    ,  /ju/    ,  /j/    ,  /w/            [ edit ]   Allophones   /s/  becomes an  alveolo-palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i]  for most speakers (but see  Differences in the language between North Korea and South Korea ). This occurs with the tense fricative and all the affricates as well. At the end of a syllable, /s/ changes to /t/ (Example: beoseot () 'mushroom').   /h/  may become a  bilabial   []  before  [o]  or  [u] , a  palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i] , a  velar   [x]  before  [] , a voiced  []  between voiced sounds, and a  [h]  elsewhere. [ citation needed ]   /p, t, , k/  become voiced  [b, d, , ]  between voiced sounds.   /l/  becomes alveolar flap  []  between vowels, and  [l]  or  []  at the end of a syllable or next to another  /l/ . Note that a written syllable-final '', when followed by a vowel or a glide ( i.e. , when the next character starts with ''), migrates to the next syllable and thus becomes  [] .   Traditionally,  /l/  was disallowed at the beginning of a word. It disappeared before  [j] , and otherwise became  /n/ . However, the inflow of western loanword changed the trend, and now word-initial  /l/  (mostly from English loanwords) are pronounced as a free variation of either  []  or  [l] . The traditional prohibition of word-initial  /l/  became a morphological rule called ""initial law"" () in South Korea, which pertains to Sino-Korean vocabulary. Such words retain their word-initial  /l/  in North Korea.   All  obstruents  (plosives, affricates, fricatives) are  unreleased   [p, t, k]  at the end of a word.   Plosive stops  /p, t, k/  become nasal stops  [m, n, ]  before nasal stops.   Hangul  spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying, partly historical  morphology . Given this, it is sometimes hard to tell which actual phonemes are present in a certain word.   One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial  [r] , and initial  [n] . For example,     ""labour"" - north:  r odong  (), south:  n odong  ()   ""history"" - north:  ry ksa  (), south:  y eoksa  ()   ""female"" - north:  ny ja  (), south:  y eoja  ()       [ edit ]   Morphophonemics   Grammatical morphemes may change shape depending on the preceding sounds. Examples include  -eun/-neun  (-/-) and  -i/-ga  (-/-). Sometimes sounds may be inserted instead. Examples include  -eul/-reul  (-/-),  -euro/-ro  (-/-),  -eseo/-seo  (-/-),  -ideunji/-deunji  (-/-) and  -iya/-ya  (-/-). However,  -euro/-ro  is somewhat irregular, since it will behave differently after a rieul consonant.

[ edit ]   Grammar       Main article:  Korean grammar         [ edit ]   Sentence structure   Korean is an  agglutinative language . Modifiers generally follow the modified word, and in the case of verb modifiers, can be serially appended. The basic form of a Korean sentence is  Subject Object Verb , but the verb is the only required and immovable element.       A :       -       -? (?)           gage-e     gasseo-yo           store + [location marker ()]     [go (verb root) ()]+[conjunctive ()]+[past ()]+[conjunctive ()]+ [interrogative marker ()]         ""Did [you] go to the store?"" (with ""you"" implied by context)         B :       .           ne           yes         ""Yes.""       [ edit ]   Parts of speech     [ edit ]   Verb   Korean  verbs  (  ,  dongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""action verbs"" or ""dynamic verbs"" to distinguish them from [  () ,  hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""]), which are also known as ""descriptive verbs"" or ""stative verbs"". Examples of action/dynamic verbs include    ( hada , ""to do, to have"") and    ( gada , ""to go"") which constitute an action or movement as opposed to descriptive verbs such as    ( yehppeuda , ""to be beautiful""). For a larger list of Korean verbs, see  wikt:Category:Korean verbs .   Unlike most of the European languages, Korean does not conjugate verbs using agreement with the subject, and nouns have no gender. Instead, verb conjugations depend upon the verb tense, aspect, mood, and the social relation between the speaker, the subjects, and the listeners. The system of speech levels and honorifics loosely resembles the  T-V distinction  of most  Indo-European languages . For example, different endings are used based on whether the subjects and listeners are friends, parents, or honoured persons.     [ edit ]   Adjective   Words categorized as Korean  adjectives  (  ,  hyeong-yongsa ,   ) conjugate similarly to verbs, so some English texts call them ""descriptive verbs"" or "" stative verbs "", but they are distinctly separate from    ( dongsa ).   English does not have an identical grammatical category, so the English translation of Korean adjectives may misleadingly suggest that they are verbs. For example,    ( bukda ) translates literally as ""to be red"" and    ( aswipda ) often best translates as ""to lack"" or ""to want for"", but both are    ( hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""). For a larger list of Korean adjectives, see  wikt:Category:Korean adjectives .     [ edit ]   Determiner   Korean  determiners  (  ,  gwanhyeongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""determinatives"", ""adnominals"", ""pre-nouns"", ""attributives"", and ""unconjugated adjectives"". Examples include    ( gak , ""each""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean determiners .     [ edit ]   Noun   A large body of Korean  nouns  (  ,  myeongsa ,   ) stem from  Chinese characters , e.g.    (,  san , mountain),    (,  yeok , station),    (,  munhwa , culture), etc. Others are native to the Korean language, e.g.    ( nara , country),    ( nal , day). Many  Sino-Korean words  have a native Korean equivalent and vice versa, but not always. Nouns do not have  grammatical gender  and can be made  plural  by adding  to the end of the word, however in most instances the  singular  form is used even when in English it would be translated as plural. For example, while in English the sentence  ""there are three apples""  would use the plural  ""apples""  instead of the singular  ""apple"" , the Korean sentence    ( sagwa segae isssumnida ) maintains the word  ( sagwa , ""apple"") in its singular form, thus rendered in English as ""apple three(things) exist."" For a list of Korean nouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean nouns .     [ edit ]   Pronoun       Main article:  Korean pronouns       Korean  pronouns  (  ,  daemyeongsa ,   ) are highly influenced by the honorifics in the language. Pronouns change forms depending on the social status of the person or persons spoken to, e.g. the pronoun for ""I"" there is both the informal    ( na ) and the honorific/humble    ( jeo ). In general second person singular pronouns are avoided, especially when using honorific forms. For a larger list or Korean pronouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean pronouns .     [ edit ]   Adverb   Korean  adverbs  (  ,  busa ,   ) include    ( tto , ""also"") and    ( gadeuk , ""fully""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean adverbs .     [ edit ]   Particle   Korean  particles  (  ,  josa ,   ) are also known in English as "" postpositions "". Examples include    ( neun , topic marker) and    ( reul , object marker). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean particles .     [ edit ]   Interjection   Korean  interjections  (  ,  gamtansa ,   ) are also known in English as ""exclamations"". Examples include    ( ani , ""no""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean interjections .     [ edit ]   Number       Main article:  Korean numerals       Korean  numbers  or numerals (  ,  sutja ,   ) consitute two regularly used sets: a native Korean set and a  Sino-Korean  set. The Sino-Korean system is nearly entirely based on the  Chinese numerals . The distinction between the two numeral systems is very important. Everything that can be counted will use one of the two systems, but seldom both. Sino-Korean words are sometimes used to mark ordinal usage: yeol beon ( ) means ""ten times"" while sip beon (() ()) means ""number ten."" The grouping of large numbers in Korean follow the Chinese tradition of myriads (10000) rather than thousands (1000) as is common in Europe and North America.     [ edit ]   Speech levels and honorifics       Main article:  Korean honorifics       The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean, and the grammar reflects this. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject referent is reflected in  honorifics , while that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in  speech level .     [ edit ]   Honorifics   When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a younger stranger, student, employee or the like. Nowadays, there are special endings which can be used on declarative, interrogative, and imperative sentences; and both honorific or normal sentences. They are made for easier and faster use of Korean.     [ edit ]   Speech levels   There are seven verb  paradigms  or  speech levels  in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation. [ citation needed ]  Unlike  honorifics   which are used to show respect towards the referent   speech levels  are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience. The names of the 7 levels are derived from the non-honorific  imperative  form of the verb    ( hada , ""do"") in each level, plus the suffix  ('che',  hanja :   ), which means ""style.""   The highest 6 levels are generally grouped together as  jondaenmal  (), while the lowest level ( haeche , ) is called  banmal  () in Korean.     [ edit ]   Vocabulary   The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words. Like Japanese and Vietnamese, more than 50% of the vocabulary (up to 60% by some estimates), especially words that denote abstract ideas, are  Sino-Korean words , [ 7 ]  either     directly borrowed from  Written Chinese , or   coined in Japan or Korea using  Chinese characters ,     in a similar way European languages borrow from Latin and Greek. Korean has two  number systems : one native, and one borrowed from Chinese.   To a much lesser extent, words have also occasionally been borrowed from  Mongolian ,  Sanskrit , and other languages. Conversely, the Korean language itself has also contributed some loanwords to other languages, most notably the  Tsushima dialect  of Japanese.   The vast majority of loanwords other than Sino-Korean come from modern times, 90% of which are from  English . [ 8 ]  Many words have also been borrowed from  Japanese  and  Western languages  such as  German  ( areubaiteu  part-time job,  allereugi  allergy). Some Western words were borrowed indirectly via Japanese, taking a Japanese sound pattern, for example dozen >     dsu  >     daseu . Most indirect Western borrowings are now written according to current Hangulization rules for the respective Western language, as if borrowed directly. There are a few more complicated borrowings such as German(y) (see  Names for Germany ), the first part of whose  endonym   [d.lant]  the Japanese approximated using the  kanji      doitsu  that were then accepted into the Korean language by their Sino-Korean pronunciation:     dok  +     il  =  Dogil . In South Korean official use, a number of other Sino-Korean country names have been replaced with phonetically oriented Hangulizations of the countries' endonyms or English names.   North Korean vocabulary shows a tendency to prefer native Korean over Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings, especially with recent political objectives aimed at eliminating foreign (mostly Chinese) influences on the Korean language in the North. By contrast, South Korean may have several Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings which tend to be absent in North Korean.     [ edit ]   Writing system       Korean writing systems           Hangul       Hanja       Hyangchal   Gugyeol   Idu       Mixed script       Korean romanization       Revised Romanization of Korean   McCune-Reischauer   Yale Romanization               Main article:  Hangul     See also:  Hangul consonant and vowel tables     In ancient times, the languages of the Korean peninsula were written using  Chinese characters , using  hyangchal  or  idu . Such systems were not popular because hanja is not well suited to the Korean language. Its use limited some cases and the aristocracy prefers  Classical Chinese  for its writing.   Korean is now mainly written in Hangul, the Korean alphabet promulgated in 1446 by  Sejong the Great ;  hanja may be mixed in  to write  Sino-Korean words . South Korea still teaches 1800 hanja characters in its schools, while the North abolished the use of hanja decades ago.   Below is a chart of the Korean alphabet's symbols and their canonical  IPA  values:     Consonants     Hangul                                                                        RR   b , p   d , t   j   g , k   pp   tt   jj   kk   p   t   ch   k   s   h   ss   m   n   ng       r , l           IPA   p   t      k   p   t      k   p   t      k   s   h   s   m   n      w   r   j         Vowels     Hangul                                                                      RR   i   e   oe   ae   a   o   u   eo   eu   ui   ye   yae   ya   yo   yu   yeo   wi   we   wae   wa   wo       IPA   i   e         a   o   u         i   je   j   ja   jo   ju   j   wi   we   w   wa   w       Modern Korean is written with  spaces  between  words , a feature not found in Chinese or Japanese. Korean  punctuation  marks are almost identical to Western ones. Traditionally, Korean was written in columns from top to bottom, right to left, but is now usually written in rows from left to right, top to bottom.     [ edit ]   Differences between North Korean and South Korean       Main article:  Korean language North-South differences       The Korean language used in the North and the South exhibits differences in pronunciation, spelling, grammar and vocabulary. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Pronunciation   In North Korea,  palatalization  of  /si/  is optional, and  //  can be pronounced as  [z]  in between vowels.   Words that are written the same way may be pronounced differently, such as the examples below. The pronunciations below are given in  Revised Romanization ,  McCune-Reischauer  and Hangul, the last of which represents what the Hangul would be if one writes the word as pronounced.       Word   Meaning   Pronunciation       North (RR/MR)   North (Hangul)   South (RR/MR)   South (Hangul)          wide   neo p tta (n p ta)      neo l tta (n l ta)             to read  (continuative form)   i l kko (i l ko)      i l kko (i l ko)             Amnok River   am r okgang (am r okkang)      am n okkang (am n okkang)             independence   dong r ip (tong r ip)      dong n ip (tong n ip)             idea / sense / conception   gwa ll yeom (kwa ll ym)      gwa nn yeom (kwa nn ym)          *   innovative   hyeoksin jj eok (hyksin tch k)      hyeoksin j eok (hyksin j k)          * Similar pronunciation is used in the North whenever the hanja """" is attached to a Sino-Korean word ending in ,  or . (In the South, this rule only applies when it is attached to any single-character Sino-Korean word.)     [ edit ]   Spelling   Some words are spelled differently by the North and the South, but the pronunciations are the same.       Word spelling   Meaning   Pronunciation (RR/MR)   Remarks       North   South             sunshine   haeppit (haepit)   The ""sai siot"" ('' used for indicating sound change) is almost never written out in the North.             cherry blossom   beotkkot (ptkkot)                cannot read   monnikda (monnikta)   Spacing.             Hallasan   hallasan (hallasan)   When a - combination is pronounced as  ll , the original Hangul spelling is kept in the North, while the Hangul is changed in the South.             rules   gyuyul (kyuyul)   In words where the original hanja is spelt """" or """" and follows a vowel, the initial  is not pronounced in the North, making the pronunciation identical with that in the South where the  is dropped in the spelling.         [ edit ]   Spelling and pronunciation   Some words have different spellings and pronunciations in the North and the South, some of which were given in the ""Phonology"" section above:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          ryeongryang (ryngryang)      yeongnyang (yngnyang)   strength   Korean words originally starting in  r  or  n  have their  r  or  n  dropped in the South Korean version if the sound following it is an  i  or  y  sound.          rodong (rodong)      nodong (nodong)   work   Korean words originally starting in  r  have their  r  changed to  n  in the South Korean version if the sound following it is a sound other than  i  or  y .          wonssu (wnssu)      wonsu (wnsu)   mortal enemy   ""Mortal enemy"" and ""head of state"" are homophones in the South. Possibly to avoid referring to  Kim Il-sung  /  Kim Jong-il  as the enemy, the second syllable of ""enemy"" is written and pronounced  in the North.          rajio (rajio)      radio (radio)   radio            u (u)      wi (wi)   on; above            anhae (anhae)      anae (anae)   wife            kkuba (kkuba)      kuba (k'uba)   Cuba   When transcribing foreign words from languages that do not have contrasts between aspirated and unaspirated stops, North Koreans generally use tensed stops for the unaspirated ones while South Koreans use aspirated stops in both cases.          pe (p'e)      pye (p'ye), pe (p'e)   lungs   All hanja pronounced as  pye  ( p'ye ) or  pe  ( p'e ) in the South are pronounced as  pe  ( p'e ) in the North. The spelling is also accordingly different.       In general, when transcribing place names, North Korea tends to use the pronunciation in the original language more than South Korea, which often uses the pronunciation in English. For example:       Original name   North Korea transliteration   English name   South Korea transliteration       Spelling   Pronunciation   Spelling   Pronunciaton       Ulaanbaatar      ullanbattareu (ullanbattar)   Ulan Bator      ullanbatoreu (ullanbat'or)       Kbenhavn      koeppenhabeun (k'oeppenhabn)   Copenhagen      kopenhagen (k'op'enhagen)       al-Qhirah      kkahira (kkahira)   Cairo      kairo (k'airo)         [ edit ]   Grammar   Some grammatical constructions are also different:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          doeyeotda (toeytta)      doeeotda (toetta)   past tense of  (doeda/toeda), ""to become""   All similar grammar forms of verbs or adjectives that end in  in the stem (i.e. , , , ,  and ) in the North use  instead of the South's .          gomawayo (komawayo)      gomawoyo (komawyo)   thanks   -irregular verbs in the North use  (wa) for all those with a positive ending vowel; this only happens in the South if the verb stem has only one syllable.          halgayo (halkayo)      halkkayo (halkkayo)   Shall we do?   Although the Hangul differ, the pronunciations are the same (i.e. with the tensed  sound).         [ edit ]   Vocabulary   Some vocabulary is different between the North and the South:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          munhwajutaek (munhwajut'aek)      apateu (ap'at')   Apartment     (appateu/appat') is also used in the North.          joseonmal (chosnmal)      han-gugeo(han'gugeo)   Korean language            gwakbap (kwakpap)      dosirak (tosirak)   lunch box           [ edit ]   Others   In the North,  guillemets     and    are the symbols used for quotes; in the South, quotation marks equivalent to the English ones,  and , are standard, although     and     are sometimes used in popular novels.     [ edit ]   Study by non-native speakers   The  United States '  Defense Language Institute  classifies Korean alongside  Arabic ,  Chinese , and  Japanese  as a Category IV language, meaning that 63 weeks of instruction (as compared to just 25 weeks for  French ,  Spanish ,  Portuguese , and  Italian ) are required to bring an English-speaking student to a limited working level of proficiency in which he or she has ""sufficient capability to meet routine social demands and limited job requirements"" and ""can deal with concrete topics in past, present, and future tense."" [ 10 ]  As a result, the study of the Korean language in the United States is dominated by  Korean American  heritage language students; they are estimated to form over 80% of all students of the language at non-military universities. [ 11 ]   However, Korean is considerably easier for speakers of certain other languages, such as Japanese, Mongolian and Turkic languages; in Japan, it is more widely studied by non-heritage learners. [ 12 ]  The  Korean Language Proficiency Test , an examination aimed at assessing non-native speakers' competence in Korean, was instituted in 1997; 17,000 people applied for the 2005 sitting of the examination.

Korean  (  /  , see  below ) is the official  language  of  North Korea  and  South Korea . It is also one of the two official languages in the  Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture  in  China . There are about 78 million Korean speakers. It was formerly written using  Hanja , borrowed  Chinese characters  pronounced in the Korean way. In the 15th century a national writing system was developed by  Sejong the Great , nowadays called  Hangul .   The genealogical  classification  of the Korean language is debated. Some linguists place it in the  Altaic  language family, while others consider it to be a  language isolate . It is  agglutinative  in its morphology and  SOV  in its  syntax .

In South Korea, the language is most often called  Hangungmal  (  ;   ), or more formally,  Hangugeo  (  ;   ) or  Gugeo  (  ;   ; literally ""national language"").   In North Korea and Yanbian in China, the language is most often called  Chosnmal  (  ; with  hanja :   ), or more formally,  Chosn  (  ;   ).   On the other hand, Korean people in the  former USSR , who refer to themselves as  Koryo-saram  (also  Goryeoin  [  ;   ; literally, "" Goryeo  person(s)""]) call the language  Goryeomal  (  ;   ).   In  mainland China , following the establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992, the term  Choxiny  (   or short form:  Choy  (  )) has normally been used to refer to the language spoken in North Korea and Yanbian, while  Hnguy  (   or short form:  Hny  (  )) is used to refer to the language spoken in South Korea.   Some older English sources also used the name ""Korean"" to refer to the language, country, and people.     [ edit ]   History   Main article:  History of the Korean language   Korean is descended from  Old Korean  and  Middle Korean .     [ edit ]   Classification   The classification of the modern Korean language is uncertain, and due to the lack of any one generally accepted theory, it is sometimes described conservatively as a  language isolate .   On the other hand, since the publication of the article of  Ramstedt  in 1926, many linguists support the hypothesis that Korean can be classified as an  Altaic  language, or as a relative of proto-Altaic. Korean is similar to Altaic languages in that they both lack certain grammatical elements, including  number ,  gender ,  articles , fusional morphology, voice, and  relative pronouns  (Kim Namkil). Korean especially bears some  morphological  resemblance to some languages of the Northern Turkic group, namely  Sakha (Yakut) . Vinokurova, a scholar of the Sakha language, noted that like in Korean, and unlike in other  Turkic languages  or a variety of other languages surveyed, adverbs in Sakha are derived from verbs with the help of derivational morphology; however, she did not suggest this implied any relation between the two languages. [ 2 ]   It is also considered likely that Korean is related in some way to  Japanese , since the two languages have nearly identical grammatical structures, and share a number of possible phonological cognates (though a majority of them are likely due to local pronunciations of the Chinese characters from which they are derived), as noted by such researchers as  Samuel E. Martin  and  Roy Andrew Miller  in the late 1960s.  Sergei Starostin  (1991) found about 25% of potential cognates in the Japanese-Korean 100-word  Swadesh list , which places these two languages closer together than other possible members of the Altaic family. [ 3 ]   Genetic relationships have been postulated both directly and indirectly, the latter either through placing both languages in the Altaic family, or by arguing for a relationship between Japanese and the  Buyeo languages  of  Goguryeo  and  Baekje  (see below); the proposed Baekje relationship is supported by cognates such as Baekje  mir , Japanese  mi-  ""three"". [ 4 ]   The possible relationship between Korean and Japanese can be exemplified by such basic vocabularly items as J.     mizu  (Old J.  midu ) : K.     mul  (Middle K.  mirh ) ""water"",  mot  ""lake""; J.     ku-ru  ""come"" (Old J.  ku , also cf. irregular root changes as in past tense   ki-ta , negative   ko-nai  in Modern J.) : K.     ka-da  (""go""); J.     kata-i  ""hard"" (whence     kata-na  ""knife, sword"") : K.  kud-yn  (hard); J.     i-ru  ""to be"" (past tense   i-ta ) : K.     i-da  ""to be""; J.  na ,  -en  : K.  anh  ""not"", J.  minna  (Old J.  mynna ) ""all, everyone"" : K.  manh-  ""many"" (predicate  mana-da ), etc.  [ 5 ] . The same possible cognates are often observed in other members of the potential  Altaic family , esp. in the  Tungusic languages . Cf. Nanay  mue  ""water"",  giagda-  ""to walk"",  anaa, anna  ""not"".   Others argue, however, that the similarities are not due to any genetic relationship, but rather to a  sprachbund  effect. [ citation needed ]  See  East Asian languages  for morphological features shared among languages of the East Asian  sprachbund , and  Classification of Japanese  for further details on the possible relationship. Though it is very difficult to believe words such as ""water"", ""to be"", and ""to go"" arise from sprachbund effects.   It is presumed that modern Korean may be more closely related to the languages of  Samhan  and  Silla  than the Buyeo languages; many Korean scholars believe they were mutually intelligible, and the collective basis of what in the  Goryeo  period would merge to become Middle Korean (the language before the changes that the  Seven-Year War  brought) and eventually Modern Korean. The  Jeju dialect  preserves some archaic features that can also be found in Middle Korean, whose  arae a  is retained in the dialect as a distinct vowel.   There are also more marginal hypotheses proposing various other relationships; for example, a few scholars, such as  Homer B. Hulbert  (1905), have tried to relate Korean to the  Dravidian languages  through the similar syntax in both. [ 6 ]   Though not related to Chinese, it has borrowed heavily; see the Vocabulary section below.     [ edit ]   Dialects   Main article:  Korean dialects          Dialects of Korean       Korean has several  dialects  (called  mal  [literally ""speech""],  saturi , or  bang-eon  in Korean). The  standard language  ( pyojuneo  or  pyojunmal ) of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  P'yngyang . All dialects of Korean are similar to each other, and are in fact all mutually intelligible, perhaps with the exception of the dialect of  Jeju Island  (see  Jeju dialect ). The dialect spoken in Jeju is in fact classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of  Seoul dialect  use very little stress, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of the  Gyeongsang dialect  have a very pronounced intonation.   It is also worth noting that there is substantial evidence for a history of extensive  dialect levelling , or even  convergent evolution  or intermixture of two or more originally distinct linguistic stocks, within the Korean language and its dialects. Many Korean dialects have basic vocabulary that is etymologically distinct from vocabulary of identical meaning in Standard Korean or other dialects, such as South Jeolla dialect /kur/ vs. Standard Korean     /ip/  ""mouth"" or Gyeongsang dialect  /.u.i/  vs. Standard Korean  /puu/  "" garlic chives ."" This suggests that the Korean Peninsula may have at one time been much more linguistically diverse than it is at present. See also the  Buyeo languages   hypothesis .   There is a very close connection between the dialects of Korean and the  regions of Korea , since the boundaries of both are largely determined by mountains and seas. Here is a list of traditional dialect names and locations:       Standard dialect   Where used       Seoul   Seoul  (),  Incheon  (/), most of  Gyeonggi  (/)       P'yngan  (/)   P'yngyang ,  P'yngan  region,  Chagang  (North Korea)       Regional dialect   Where used       Gyeonggi   limited areas of the  Gyeonggi  region (South Korea)       Chungcheong   Daejeon ,  Chungcheong  region (South Korea)       Gangwon   Gangwon-do (South Korea) / Kangwn (North Korea)       Gyeongsang   Busan ,  Daegu ,  Ulsan ,  Gyeongsang  region (South Korea)       Hamgyng   Rasn ,  Hamgyng  region,  Ryanggang  (North Korea)       Hwanghae   Hwanghae  region (North Korea)       Jeju   Jeju Island/Province  (South Korea)       Jeolla   Gwangju ,  Jeolla  region (South Korea)         [ edit ]   Phonology       This article contains  IPA  phonetic symbols.  Without proper  rendering support , you may see  question marks, boxes, or other symbols  instead of  Unicode  characters.       Main article:  Korean phonology     [ edit ]   Consonants          The Korean consonants             Bilabial   Alveolar   Post-  alveolar   Velar   Glottal       Nasal      /m/      /n/        //  (syllable-final)         Plosive  and   Affricate   plain      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         tense      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         aspirated      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         Fricative   plain        /s/          /h/       tense        /s/             Liquid        /l/           The  IPA  symbol <  > (a subscript double straight quotation mark, shown here with a placeholder circle) is used to denote the tensed consonants  /p/, /t/, /k/, //, /s/ . Its official use in the  Extensions to the IPA  is for  'strong'  articulation, but is used in the literature for  faucalized voice . The Korean consonants also have elements of  stiff voice , but it is not yet known how typical this is of faucalized consonants. They are produced with a partially constricted  glottis  and additional subglottal pressure in addition to tense vocal tract walls, laryngeal lowering, or other expansion of the larynx.     [ edit ]   Vowels                    The Korean basic vowels                 Monophthongs   /i/    ,  /e/    ,  //    ,  /a/    ,  /o/    ,  /u/    ,  //    ,  //    ,  //          Vowels preceded by intermediaries,  or Diphthongs   /je/    ,  /j/    ,  /ja/    ,  /wi/    ,  /we/    ,  /w/    ,  /wa/    ,  /i/    ,  /jo/    ,  /ju/    ,  /j/    ,  /w/            [ edit ]   Allophones   /s/  becomes an  alveolo-palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i]  for most speakers (but see  Differences in the language between North Korea and South Korea ). This occurs with the tense fricative and all the affricates as well. At the end of a syllable, /s/ changes to /t/ (Example: beoseot () 'mushroom').   /h/  may become a  bilabial   []  before  [o]  or  [u] , a  palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i] , a  velar   [x]  before  [] , a voiced  []  between voiced sounds, and a  [h]  elsewhere. [ citation needed ]   /p, t, , k/  become voiced  [b, d, , ]  between voiced sounds.   /l/  becomes alveolar flap  []  between vowels, and  [l]  or  []  at the end of a syllable or next to another  /l/ . Note that a written syllable-final '', when followed by a vowel or a glide ( i.e. , when the next character starts with ''), migrates to the next syllable and thus becomes  [] .   Traditionally,  /l/  was disallowed at the beginning of a word. It disappeared before  [j] , and otherwise became  /n/ . However, the inflow of western loanword changed the trend, and now word-initial  /l/  (mostly from English loanwords) are pronounced as a free variation of either  []  or  [l] . The traditional prohibition of word-initial  /l/  became a morphological rule called ""initial law"" () in South Korea, which pertains to Sino-Korean vocabulary. Such words retain their word-initial  /l/  in North Korea.   All  obstruents  (plosives, affricates, fricatives) are  unreleased   [p, t, k]  at the end of a word.   Plosive stops  /p, t, k/  become nasal stops  [m, n, ]  before nasal stops.   Hangul  spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying, partly historical  morphology . Given this, it is sometimes hard to tell which actual phonemes are present in a certain word.   One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial  [r] , and initial  [n] . For example,     ""labour"" - north:  r odong  (), south:  n odong  ()   ""history"" - north:  ry ksa  (), south:  y eoksa  ()   ""female"" - north:  ny ja  (), south:  y eoja  ()       [ edit ]   Morphophonemics   Grammatical morphemes may change shape depending on the preceding sounds. Examples include  -eun/-neun  (-/-) and  -i/-ga  (-/-). Sometimes sounds may be inserted instead. Examples include  -eul/-reul  (-/-),  -euro/-ro  (-/-),  -eseo/-seo  (-/-),  -ideunji/-deunji  (-/-) and  -iya/-ya  (-/-). However,  -euro/-ro  is somewhat irregular, since it will behave differently after a rieul consonant.     Korean particles     After a consonant   After a rieul   After a vowel       -ui  (-)       -eun  (-)   -neun  (-)       -i  (-)   -ga  (-)       -eul  (-)   -reul  (-)       -gwa  (-)   -wa  (-)       -euro  (-)   -ro  (-)       Some verbs may also change shape morphophonemically.     [ edit ]   Grammar   Main article:  Korean grammar     [ edit ]   Sentence structure   Korean is an  agglutinative language . Modifiers generally follow the modified word, and in the case of verb modifiers, can be serially appended. The basic form of a Korean sentence is  Subject Object Verb , but the verb is the only required and immovable element.       A :       -       -? (?)           kage-e     kasseo-yo           store + [location marker ()]     [go (verb root) ()]+[conjunctive ()]+[past ()]+[conjunctive ()]+ [polite marker ()]         ""Did [you] go to the store?"" (with ""you"" implied by context)         B :       .           ye           yes         ""Yes.""       [ edit ]   Parts of speech     [ edit ]   Verb   Korean  verbs  (  ,  tongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""action verbs"" or ""dynamic verbs"" to distinguish them from [  () ,  hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""]), which are also known as ""descriptive verbs"" or ""stative verbs"". Examples of action/dynamic verbs include    ( hada , ""to do"") and    ( kada , ""to go"") which constitute an action or movement as opposed to descriptive verbs such as    ( yehppeuda , ""to be beautiful""). For a larger list of Korean verbs, see  wikt:Category:Korean verbs .   Unlike most of the European languages, Korean does not conjugate verbs using agreement with the subject, and nouns have no gender. Instead, verb conjugations depend upon the verb tense, aspect, mood, and the social relation between the speaker, the subjects, and the listeners. The system of speech levels and honorifics loosely resembles the  T-V distinction  of most  Indo-European languages . For example, different endings are used based on the speaker's relation with the person they are talking to or the person about which they are talking. Politeness is a critical part of Korean language and Korean culture, therefore, when talking to someone esteemed, the correct verb ending, which should have a lot of respect, must be chosen.     [ edit ]   Adjective   Words categorized as Korean  adjectives  (  ,  hyeong-yongsa ,   ) conjugate similarly to verbs, so some English texts call them ""descriptive verbs"" or "" stative verbs "", but they are distinctly separate from    ( tongsa ).   English does not have an identical grammatical category, so the English translation of Korean adjectives may misleadingly suggest that they are verbs. For example,    ( pukda ) translates literally as ""to be red"" and    ( aswipda ) often best translates as ""to lack"" or ""to want for"", but both are    ( hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""). For a larger list of Korean adjectives, see  wikt:Category:Korean adjectives .     [ edit ]   Determiner   Korean  determiners  (  ,  gwanhyeongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""determinatives"", ""adnominals"", ""pre-nouns"", ""attributives"", and ""unconjugated adjectives"". Examples include    ( kak , ""each""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean determiners .     [ edit ]   Noun   A large body of Korean  nouns  (  ,  myeongsa ,   ) stem from  Chinese characters , e.g.    (,  san , mountain),    (,  yeok , station),    (,  munhwa , culture), etc. Others are native to the Korean language, e.g.    ( nara , country),    ( nal , day). Many  Sino-Korean words  have a native Korean equivalent and vice versa, but not always. Nouns do not have  grammatical gender  and can be made  plural  by adding  to the end of the word, however in most instances the  singular  form is used even when in English it would be translated as plural. For example, while in English the sentence  ""there are three apples""  would use the plural  ""apples""  instead of the singular  ""apple"" , the Korean sentence    ( sagwa segae isssumnida ) maintains the word  ( sagwa , ""apple"") in its singular form, thus rendered in English as ""apple three(things) exist."" For a list of Korean nouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean nouns .     [ edit ]   Pronoun   Main article:  Korean pronouns   Korean  pronouns  (  ,  daemyeongsa ,   ) are highly influenced by the honorifics in the language. Pronouns change forms depending on the social status of the person or persons spoken to, e.g. the pronoun for ""I"" there is both the informal    ( na ) and the honorific/humble    ( jeo ). In general second person singular pronouns are avoided, especially when using honorific forms. For a larger list or Korean pronouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean pronouns .     [ edit ]   Adverb   Korean  adverbs  (  ,  busa ,   ) include    ( tto , ""also"") and    ( gadeuk , ""fully""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean adverbs .     [ edit ]   Particle   Korean  particles  (  ,  josa ,   ) are also known in English as "" postpositions "". Examples include    ( neun , topic marker) and    ( reul , object marker). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean particles .     [ edit ]   Interjection   Korean  interjections  (  ,  gamtansa ,   ) are also known in English as ""exclamations"". Examples include    ( ani , ""no""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean interjections .     [ edit ]   Number   Main article:  Korean numerals   Korean  numbers  or numerals (  ,  sutja ,   ) consitute two regularly used sets: a native Korean set and a  Sino-Korean  set. The Sino-Korean system is nearly entirely based on the  Chinese numerals . The distinction between the two numeral systems is very important. Everything that can be counted will use one of the two systems, but seldom both. Sino-Korean words are sometimes used to mark ordinal usage: yeol beon ( ) means ""ten times"" while sip beon (() ()) means ""number ten."" The grouping of large numbers in Korean follow the Chinese tradition of myriads (10000) rather than thousands (1000) as is common in Europe and North America.     [ edit ]   Speech levels and honorifics   Main article:  Korean honorifics   The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean, and the grammar reflects this. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject referent is reflected in  honorifics , while that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in  speech level .     [ edit ]   Honorifics   When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a younger stranger, student, employee or the like. Nowadays, there are special endings which can be used on declarative, interrogative, and imperative sentences; and both honorific or normal sentences. They are made for easier and faster use of Korean.     [ edit ]   Speech levels   There are seven verb  paradigms  or  speech levels  in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation. [ citation needed ]  Unlike  honorifics   which are used to show respect towards the referent   speech levels  are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience. The names of the 7 levels are derived from the non-honorific  imperative  form of the verb    ( hada , ""do"") in each level, plus the suffix  ('che',  hanja :   ), which means ""style.""   The highest 6 levels are generally grouped together as  jondaenmal  (), while the lowest level ( haeche , ) is called  banmal  () in Korean.     [ edit ]   Vocabulary   The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words. Like Japanese and Vietnamese, more than 50% of the vocabulary (up to 60% by some estimates), especially words that denote abstract ideas, are  Sino-Korean words , [ 7 ]  either     directly borrowed from  Written Chinese , or   coined in Japan or Korea using  Chinese characters ,     in a similar way European languages borrow from Latin and Greek. Korean has two  number systems : one native, and one borrowed from Chinese.   To a much lesser extent, words have also occasionally been borrowed from  Mongolian ,  Sanskrit , and other languages. Conversely, the Korean language itself has also contributed some loanwords to other languages, most notably the  Tsushima dialect  of Japanese.   The vast majority of loanwords other than Sino-Korean come from modern times, 90% of which are from  English . [ 8 ]  Many words have also been borrowed from  Japanese  and  Western languages  such as  German  ( areubaiteu  part-time job,  allereugi  allergy). Some Western words were borrowed indirectly via Japanese, taking a Japanese sound pattern, for example dozen >     dsu  >     daseu . Most indirect Western borrowings are now written according to current Hangulization rules for the respective Western language, as if borrowed directly. There are a few more complicated borrowings such as German(y) (see  Names for Germany ), the first part of whose  endonym   [d.lant]  the Japanese approximated using the  kanji      doitsu  that were then accepted into the Korean language by their Sino-Korean pronunciation:     dok  +     il  =  Dogil . In South Korean official use, a number of other Sino-Korean country names have been replaced with phonetically oriented Hangulizations of the countries' endonyms or English names.   North Korean vocabulary shows a tendency to prefer native Korean over Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings, especially with recent political objectives aimed at eliminating foreign (mostly Chinese) influences on the Korean language in the North. By contrast, South Korean may have several Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings which tend to be absent in North Korean.     [ edit ]   Writing system       Korean writing systems           Hangul       Hanja       Hyangchal   Gugyeol   Idu       Mixed script       Korean romanization       Revised Romanization of Korean   McCune-Reischauer   Yale Romanization           Main article:  Hangul   See also:  Hangul consonant and vowel tables   In ancient times, the languages of the Korean peninsula were written using  Chinese characters , using  hyangchal  or  idu . Such systems were not popular because hanja is not well suited to the Korean language. Its use is now limited.   Korean is now mainly written in Hangul, the Korean alphabet promulgated in 1446 by  Sejong the Great ;  hanja may be mixed in  to write  Sino-Korean words . South Korea still teaches 1800 hanja characters in its schools, while the North abolished the use of hanja decades ago.   Below is a chart of the Korean alphabet's symbols and their canonical  IPA  values:     Consonants     Hangul                                                                        RR   b , p   d , t   j   g , k   pp   tt   jj   kk   p   t   ch   k   s   h   ss   m   n   ng       r , l           IPA   p   t      k   p   t      k   p   t      k   s   h   s   m   n      w   r   j         Vowels     Hangul                                                                      RR   i   e   oe   ae   a   o   u   eo   eu   ui   ye   yae   ya   yo   yu   yeo   wi   we   wae   wa   wo       IPA   i   e         a   o   u         i   je   j   ja   jo   ju   j   wi   we   w   wa   w       Modern Korean is written with  spaces  between  words , a feature not found in Chinese or Japanese. Korean  punctuation  marks are almost identical to Western ones. Traditionally, Korean was written in columns from top to bottom, right to left, but is now usually written in rows from left to right, top to bottom.     [ edit ]   Differences between North Korean and South Korean   Main article:  Korean language North-South differences   The Korean language used in the North and the South exhibits differences in pronunciation, spelling, grammar and vocabulary. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Pronunciation   In North Korea,  palatalization  of  /si/  is optional, and  //  can be pronounced as  [z]  in between vowels.   Words that are written the same way may be pronounced differently, such as the examples below. The pronunciations below are given in  Revised Romanization ,  McCune-Reischauer  and Hangul, the last of which represents what the Hangul would be if one writes the word as pronounced.       Word   Meaning   Pronunciation       North (RR/MR)   North (Hangul)   South (RR/MR)   South (Hangul)          wide   neo p tta (n p ta)      neo l tta (n l ta)             to read  (continuative form)   i l kko (i l ko)      i l kko (i l ko)             Amnok River   am r okgang (am r okkang)      am n okkang (am n okkang)             independence   dong r ip (tong r ip)      dong n ip (tong n ip)             idea / sense / conception   gwa ll yeom (kwa ll ym)      gwa nn yeom (kwa nn ym)          *   innovative   hyeoksin jj eok (hyksin tch k)      hyeoksin j eok (hyksin j k)          * Similar pronunciation is used in the North whenever the hanja """" is attached to a Sino-Korean word ending in ,  or . (In the South, this rule only applies when it is attached to any single-character Sino-Korean word.)     [ edit ]   Spelling   Some words are spelled differently by the North and the South, but the pronunciations are the same.       Word spelling   Meaning   Pronunciation (RR/MR)   Remarks       North   South             sunshine   haeppit (haepit)   The ""sai siot"" ('' used for indicating sound change) is almost never written out in the North.             cherry blossom   beotkkot (ptkkot)                cannot read   monnikda (monnikta)   Spacing.             Hallasan   hallasan (hallasan)   When a - combination is pronounced as  ll , the original Hangul spelling is kept in the North, while the Hangul is changed in the South.             rules   gyuyul (kyuyul)   In words where the original hanja is spelt """" or """" and follows a vowel, the initial  is not pronounced in the North, making the pronunciation identical with that in the South where the  is dropped in the spelling.         [ edit ]   Spelling and pronunciation   Some words have different spellings and pronunciations in the North and the South, some of which were given in the ""Phonology"" section above:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          ryeongryang (ryngryang)      yeongnyang (yngnyang)   strength   Korean words originally starting in  r  or  n  have their  r  or  n  dropped in the South Korean version if the sound following it is an  i  or  y  sound.          rodong (rodong)      nodong (nodong)   work   Korean words originally starting in  r  have their  r  changed to  n  in the South Korean version if the sound following it is a sound other than  i  or  y .          wonssu (wnssu)      wonsu (wnsu)   mortal enemy   ""Mortal enemy"" and ""head of state"" are homophones in the South. Possibly to avoid referring to  Kim Il-sung  /  Kim Jong-il  as the enemy, the second syllable of ""enemy"" is written and pronounced  in the North.          rajio (rajio)      radio (radio)   radio            u (u)      wi (wi)   on; above            anhae (anhae)      anae (anae)   wife            kkuba (kkuba)      kuba (k'uba)   Cuba   When transcribing foreign words from languages that do not have contrasts between aspirated and unaspirated stops, North Koreans generally use tensed stops for the unaspirated ones while South Koreans use aspirated stops in both cases.          pe (p'e)      pye (p'ye), pe (p'e)   lungs   All hanja pronounced as  pye  ( p'ye ) or  pe  ( p'e ) in the South are pronounced as  pe  ( p'e ) in the North. The spelling is also accordingly different.       In general, when transcribing place names, North Korea tends to use the pronunciation in the original language more than South Korea, which often uses the pronunciation in English. For example:       Original name   North Korea transliteration   English name   South Korea transliteration       Spelling   Pronunciation   Spelling   Pronunciaton       Ulaanbaatar      ullanbattareu (ullanbattar)   Ulan Bator      ullanbatoreu (ullanbat'or)       Kbenhavn      koeppenhabeun (k'oeppenhabn)   Copenhagen      kopenhagen (k'op'enhagen)       al-Qhirah      kkahira (kkahira)   Cairo      kairo (k'airo)         [ edit ]   Grammar   Some grammatical constructions are also different:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          doeyeotda (toeytta)      doeeotda (toetta)   past tense of  (doeda/toeda), ""to become""   All similar grammar forms of verbs or adjectives that end in  in the stem (i.e. , , , ,  and ) in the North use  instead of the South's .          gomawayo (komawayo)      gomawoyo (komawyo)   thanks   -irregular verbs in the North use  (wa) for all those with a positive ending vowel; this only happens in the South if the verb stem has only one syllable.          halgayo (halkayo)      halkkayo (halkkayo)   Shall we do?   Although the Hangul differ, the pronunciations are the same (i.e. with the tensed  sound).         [ edit ]   Vocabulary   Some vocabulary is different between the North and the South:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          munhwajutaek (munhwajut'aek)      apateu (ap'at')   Apartment     (appateu/appat') is also used in the North.          joseonmal (chosnmal)      han-gugeo(han'gugeo)   Korean language            gwakbap (kwakpap)      dosirak (tosirak)   lunch box           [ edit ]   Others   In the North,  guillemets     and    are the symbols used for quotes; in the South, quotation marks equivalent to the English ones,  and , are standard, although     and     are sometimes used in popular novels.     [ edit ]   Study by non-native speakers   The  United States '  Defense Language Institute  classifies Korean alongside  Arabic ,  Chinese , and  Japanese  as a Category IV language, meaning that 63 weeks of instruction (as compared to just 25 weeks for  French ,  Spanish ,  Portuguese , and  Italian ) are required to bring an English-speaking student to a limited working level of proficiency in which he or she has ""sufficient capability to meet routine social demands and limited job requirements"" and ""can deal with concrete topics in past, present, and future tense."" [ 10 ]  As a result, the study of the Korean language in the United States is dominated by  Korean American  heritage language students; they are estimated to form over 80% of all students of the language at non-military universities. [ 11 ]   However, Korean is considerably easier for speakers of certain other languages, such as Japanese, Mongolian and Turkic languages; in Japan, it is more widely studied by non-heritage learners. [ 12 ]  The  Korean Language Proficiency Test , an examination aimed at assessing non-native speakers' competence in Korean, was instituted in 1997; 17,000 people applied for the 2005 sitting of the examination.

Korean  (  /  , see  below ) is the official  language  of  North Korea  and  South Korea . It is also one of the two official languages in the  Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture  in  China . There are about 78 million Korean speakers. It was formerly written using  Hanja , borrowed  Chinese characters  pronounced in the Korean way. In the 15th century a national writing system was developed by  Sejong the Great , nowadays called  Hangul .   The genealogical  classification  of the Korean language is debated. Some linguists place it in the  Altaic  language family, while others consider it to be a  language isolate . It is  agglutinative  in its morphology and  SOV  in its  syntax .

In South Korea, the language is most often called  Hangungmal  (  ;   ), or more formally,  Hangugeo  (  ;   ) or  Gugeo  (  ;   ; literally ""national language"").   In North Korea and Yanbian in China, the language is most often called  Chosnmal  (  ; with  hanja :   ), or more formally,  Chosn  (  ;   ).   On the other hand, Korean people in the  former USSR , who refer to themselves as  Koryo-saram  (also  Goryeoin  [  ;   ; literally, "" Goryeo  person(s)""]) call the language  Goryeomal  (  ;   ).   In  mainland China , following the establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992, the term  Choxiny  (   or short form:  Choy  (  )) has normally been used to refer to the language spoken in North Korea and Yanbian, while  Hnguy  (   or short form:  Hny  (  )) is used to refer to the language spoken in South Korea.   Some older English sources also used the name ""Korean"" to refer to the language, country, and people.     [ edit ]   History   Main article:  History of the Korean language   Korean is descended from  Old Korean  and  Middle Korean .     [ edit ]   Classification   The classification of the modern Korean language is uncertain, and due to the lack of any one generally accepted theory, it is sometimes described conservatively as a  language isolate .   On the other hand, since the publication of the article of  Ramstedt  in 1926, many linguists support the hypothesis that Korean can be classified as an  Altaic  language, or as a relative of proto-Altaic. Korean is similar to Altaic languages in that they both lack certain grammatical elements, including  number ,  gender ,  articles , fusional morphology, voice, and  relative pronouns  (Kim Namkil). Korean especially bears some  morphological  resemblance to some languages of the Northern Turkic group, namely  Sakha (Yakut) . Vinokurova, a scholar of the Sakha language, noted that like in Korean, and unlike in other  Turkic languages  or a variety of other languages surveyed, adverbs in Sakha are derived from verbs with the help of derivational morphology; however, she did not suggest this implied any relation between the two languages. [ 2 ]   It is also considered likely that Korean is related in some way to  Japanese , since the two languages have nearly identical grammatical structures, and share a number of possible phonological cognates (though a majority of them are likely due to local pronunciations of the Chinese characters from which they are derived), as noted by such researchers as  Samuel E. Martin  and  Roy Andrew Miller  in the late 1960s.  Sergei Starostin  (1991) found about 25% of potential cognates in the Japanese-Korean 100-word  Swadesh list , which places these two languages closer together than other possible members of the Altaic family. [ 3 ]   Genetic relationships have been postulated both directly and indirectly, the latter either through placing both languages in the Altaic family, or by arguing for a relationship between Japanese and the  Buyeo languages  of  Goguryeo  and  Baekje  (see below); the proposed Baekje relationship is supported by cognates such as Baekje  mir , Japanese  mi-  ""three"". [ 4 ]   The possible relationship between Korean and Japanese can be exemplified by such basic vocabularly items as J.     mizu  (Old J.  midu ) : K.     mul  (Middle K.  mirh ) ""water"",  mot  ""lake""; J.     ku-ru  ""come"" (Old J.  ku , also cf. irregular root changes as in past tense   ki-ta , negative   ko-nai  in Modern J.) : K.     ka-da  (""go""); J.     kata-i  ""hard"" (whence     kata-na  ""knife, sword"") : K.  kud-yn  (hard); J.     i-ru  ""to be"" (past tense   i-ta ) : K.     i-da  ""to be""; J.  na ,  -en  : K.  anh  ""not"", J.  minna  (Old J.  mynna ) ""all, everyone"" : K.  manh-  ""many"" (predicate  mana-da ), etc.  [ 5 ] . The same possible cognates are often observed in other members of the potential  Altaic family , esp. in the  Tungusic languages . Cf. Nanay  mue  ""water"",  giagda-  ""to walk"",  anaa, anna  ""not"".   Others argue, however, that the similarities are not due to any genetic relationship, but rather to a  sprachbund  effect. [ citation needed ]  See  East Asian languages  for morphological features shared among languages of the East Asian  sprachbund , and  Classification of Japanese  for further details on the possible relationship. Though it is very difficult to believe words such as ""water"", ""to be"", and ""to go"" arise from sprachbund effects.   It is presumed that modern Korean may be more closely related to the languages of  Samhan  and  Silla  than the Buyeo languages; many Korean scholars believe they were mutually intelligible, and the collective basis of what in the  Goryeo  period would merge to become Middle Korean (the language before the changes that the  Seven-Year War  brought) and eventually Modern Korean. The  Jeju dialect  preserves some archaic features that can also be found in Middle Korean, whose  arae a  is retained in the dialect as a distinct vowel.   There are also more marginal hypotheses proposing various other relationships; for example, a few scholars, such as  Homer B. Hulbert  (1905), have tried to relate Korean to the  Dravidian languages  through the similar syntax in both. [ 6 ]   Though not related to Chinese, it has borrowed heavily; see the Vocabulary section below.     [ edit ]   Dialects   Main article:  Korean dialects          Dialects of Korean       Korean has several  dialects  (called  mal  [literally ""speech""],  saturi , or  bang-eon  in Korean). The  standard language  ( pyojuneo  or  pyojunmal ) of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  P'yngyang . All dialects of Korean are similar to each other, and are in fact all mutually intelligible, perhaps with the exception of the dialect of  Jeju Island  (see  Jeju dialect ). The dialect spoken in Jeju is in fact classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of  Seoul dialect  use very little stress, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of the  Gyeongsang dialect  have a very pronounced intonation.   It is also worth noting that there is substantial evidence for a history of extensive  dialect levelling , or even  convergent evolution  or intermixture of two or more originally distinct linguistic stocks, within the Korean language and its dialects. Many Korean dialects have basic vocabulary that is etymologically distinct from vocabulary of identical meaning in Standard Korean or other dialects, such as South Jeolla dialect /kur/ vs. Standard Korean     /ip/  ""mouth"" or Gyeongsang dialect  /.u.i/  vs. Standard Korean  /puu/  "" garlic chives ."" This suggests that the Korean Peninsula may have at one time been much more linguistically diverse than it is at present. See also the  Buyeo languages   hypothesis .   There is a very close connection between the dialects of Korean and the  regions of Korea , since the boundaries of both are largely determined by mountains and seas. Here is a list of traditional dialect names and locations:       Standard dialect   Where used       Seoul   Seoul  (),  Incheon  (/), most of  Gyeonggi  (/)       P'yngan  (/)   P'yngyang ,  P'yngan  region,  Chagang  (North Korea)       Regional dialect   Where used       Gyeonggi   limited areas of the  Gyeonggi  region (South Korea)       Chungcheong   Daejeon ,  Chungcheong  region (South Korea)       Gangwon   Gangwon-do (South Korea) / Kangwn (North Korea)       Gyeongsang   Busan ,  Daegu ,  Ulsan ,  Gyeongsang  region (South Korea)       Hamgyng   Rasn ,  Hamgyng  region,  Ryanggang  (North Korea)       Hwanghae   Hwanghae  region (North Korea)       Jeju   Jeju Island/Province  (South Korea)       Jeolla   Gwangju ,  Jeolla  region (South Korea)         [ edit ]   Phonology       This article contains  IPA  phonetic symbols.  Without proper  rendering support , you may see  question marks, boxes, or other symbols  instead of  Unicode  characters.       Main article:  Korean phonology     [ edit ]   Consonants          The Korean consonants             Bilabial   Alveolar   Post-  alveolar   Velar   Glottal       Nasal      /m/      /n/        //  (syllable-final)         Plosive  and   Affricate   plain      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         tense      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         aspirated      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         Fricative   plain        /s/          /h/       tense        /s/             Liquid        /l/           The  IPA  symbol <  > (a subscript double straight quotation mark, shown here with a placeholder circle) is used to denote the tensed consonants  /p/, /t/, /k/, //, /s/ . Its official use in the  Extensions to the IPA  is for  'strong'  articulation, but is used in the literature for  faucalized voice . The Korean consonants also have elements of  stiff voice , but it is not yet known how typical this is of faucalized consonants. They are produced with a partially constricted  glottis  and additional subglottal pressure in addition to tense vocal tract walls, laryngeal lowering, or other expansion of the larynx.     [ edit ]   Vowels                    The Korean basic vowels                 Monophthongs   /i/    ,  /e/    ,  //    ,  /a/    ,  /o/    ,  /u/    ,  //    ,  //    ,  //          Vowels preceded by intermediaries,  or Diphthongs   /je/    ,  /j/    ,  /ja/    ,  /wi/    ,  /we/    ,  /w/    ,  /wa/    ,  /i/    ,  /jo/    ,  /ju/    ,  /j/    ,  /w/            [ edit ]   Allophones   /s/  becomes an  alveolo-palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i]  for most speakers (but see  Differences in the language between North Korea and South Korea ). This occurs with the tense fricative and all the affricates as well. At the end of a syllable, /s/ changes to /t/ (Example: beoseot () 'mushroom').   /h/  may become a  bilabial   []  before  [o]  or  [u] , a  palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i] , a  velar   [x]  before  [] , a voiced  []  between voiced sounds, and a  [h]  elsewhere. [ citation needed ]   /p, t, , k/  become voiced  [b, d, , ]  between voiced sounds.   /l/  becomes alveolar flap  []  between vowels, and  [l]  or  []  at the end of a syllable or next to another  /l/ . Note that a written syllable-final '', when followed by a vowel or a glide ( i.e. , when the next character starts with ''), migrates to the next syllable and thus becomes  [] .   Traditionally,  /l/  was disallowed at the beginning of a word. It disappeared before  [j] , and otherwise became  /n/ . However, the inflow of western loanword changed the trend, and now word-initial  /l/  (mostly from English loanwords) are pronounced as a free variation of either  []  or  [l] . The traditional prohibition of word-initial  /l/  became a morphological rule called ""initial law"" () in South Korea, which pertains to Sino-Korean vocabulary. Such words retain their word-initial  /l/  in North Korea.   All  obstruents  (plosives, affricates, fricatives) are  unreleased   [p, t, k]  at the end of a word.   Plosive stops  /p, t, k/  become nasal stops  [m, n, ]  before nasal stops.   Hangul  spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying, partly historical  morphology . Given this, it is sometimes hard to tell which actual phonemes are present in a certain word.   One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial  [r] , and initial  [n] . For example,     ""labour"" - north:  r odong  (), south:  n odong  ()   ""history"" - north:  ry ksa  (), south:  y eoksa  ()   ""female"" - north:  ny ja  (), south:  y eoja  ()       [ edit ]   Morphophonemics   Grammatical morphemes may change shape depending on the preceding sounds. Examples include  -eun/-neun  (-/-) and  -i/-ga  (-/-). Sometimes sounds may be inserted instead. Examples include  -eul/-reul  (-/-),  -euro/-ro  (-/-),  -eseo/-seo  (-/-),  -ideunji/-deunji  (-/-) and  -iya/-ya  (-/-). However,  -euro/-ro  is somewhat irregular, since it will behave differently after a rieul consonant.     Korean particles     After a consonant   After a rieul   After a vowel       -ui  (-)       -eun  (-)   -neun  (-)       -i  (-)   -ga  (-)       -eul  (-)   -reul  (-)       -gwa  (-)   -wa  (-)       -euro  (-)   -ro  (-)       Some verbs may also change shape morphophonemically.     [ edit ]   Grammar   Main article:  Korean grammar     [ edit ]   Sentence structure   Korean is an  agglutinative language . Modifiers generally follow the modified word, and in the case of verb modifiers, can be serially appended. The basic form of a Korean sentence is  Subject Object Verb , but the verb is the only required and immovable element.       A :       -       -? (?)           kage-e     kasseo-yo           store + [location marker ()]     [go (verb root) ()]+[conjunctive ()]+[past ()]+[conjunctive ()]+ [polite marker ()]         ""Did [you] go to the store?"" (with ""you"" implied by context)         B :       .           ye           yes         ""Yes.""       [ edit ]   Parts of speech     [ edit ]   Verb   Korean  verbs  (  ,  tongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""action verbs"" or ""dynamic verbs"" to distinguish them from [  () ,  hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""]), which are also known as ""descriptive verbs"" or ""stative verbs"". Examples of action/dynamic verbs include    ( hada , ""to do"") and    ( kada , ""to go"") which constitute an action or movement as opposed to descriptive verbs such as    ( yehppeuda , ""to be beautiful""). For a larger list of Korean verbs, see  wikt:Category:Korean verbs .   Unlike most of the European languages, Korean does not conjugate verbs using agreement with the subject, and nouns have no gender. Instead, verb conjugations depend upon the verb tense, aspect, mood, and the social relation between the speaker, the subjects, and the listeners. The system of speech levels and honorifics loosely resembles the  T-V distinction  of most  Indo-European languages . For example, different endings are used based on the speaker's relation with the person they are talking to or the person about which they are talking. Politeness is a critical part of Korean language and Korean culture, therefore, when talking to someone esteemed, the correct verb ending, which should have a lot of respect, must be chosen.     [ edit ]   Adjective   Words categorized as Korean  adjectives  (  ,  hyeong-yongsa ,   ) conjugate similarly to verbs, so some English texts call them ""descriptive verbs"" or "" stative verbs "", but they are distinctly separate from    ( tongsa ).   English does not have an identical grammatical category, so the English translation of Korean adjectives may misleadingly suggest that they are verbs. For example,    ( pukda ) translates literally as ""to be red"" and    ( aswipda ) often best translates as ""to lack"" or ""to want for"", but both are    ( hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""). For a larger list of Korean adjectives, see  wikt:Category:Korean adjectives .     [ edit ]   Determiner   Korean  determiners  (  ,  gwanhyeongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""determinatives"", ""adnominals"", ""pre-nouns"", ""attributives"", and ""unconjugated adjectives"". Examples include    ( kak , ""each""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean determiners .     [ edit ]   Noun   A large body of Korean  nouns  (  ,  myeongsa ,   ) stem from  Chinese characters , e.g.    (,  san , mountain),    (,  yeok , station),    (,  munhwa , culture), etc. Others are native to the Korean language, e.g.    ( nara , country),    ( nal , day). Many  Sino-Korean words  have a native Korean equivalent and vice versa, but not always. Nouns do not have  grammatical gender  and can be made  plural  by adding  to the end of the word, however in most instances the  singular  form is used even when in English it would be translated as plural. For example, while in English the sentence  ""there are three apples""  would use the plural  ""apples""  instead of the singular  ""apple"" , the Korean sentence    ( sagwa segae isssumnida ) maintains the word  ( sagwa , ""apple"") in its singular form, thus rendered in English as ""apple three(things) exist."" For a list of Korean nouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean nouns .     [ edit ]   Pronoun   Main article:  Korean pronouns   Korean  pronouns  (  ,  daemyeongsa ,   ) are highly influenced by the honorifics in the language. Pronouns change forms depending on the social status of the person or persons spoken to, e.g. the pronoun for ""I"" there is both the informal    ( na ) and the honorific/humble    ( jeo ). In general second person singular pronouns are avoided, especially when using honorific forms. For a larger list or Korean pronouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean pronouns .     [ edit ]   Adverb   Korean  adverbs  (  ,  busa ,   ) include    ( tto , ""also"") and    ( gadeuk , ""fully""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean adverbs .     [ edit ]   Particle   Korean  particles  (  ,  josa ,   ) are also known in English as "" postpositions "". Examples include    ( neun , topic marker) and    ( reul , object marker). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean particles .     [ edit ]   Interjection   Korean  interjections  (  ,  gamtansa ,   ) are also known in English as ""exclamations"". Examples include    ( ani , ""no""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean interjections .     [ edit ]   Number   Main article:  Korean numerals   Korean  numbers  or numerals (  ,  sutja ,   ) consitute two regularly used sets: a native Korean set and a  Sino-Korean  set. The Sino-Korean system is nearly entirely based on the  Chinese numerals . The distinction between the two numeral systems is very important. Everything that can be counted will use one of the two systems, but seldom both. Sino-Korean words are sometimes used to mark ordinal usage: yeol beon ( ) means ""ten times"" while sip beon (() ()) means ""number ten."" The grouping of large numbers in Korean follow the Chinese tradition of myriads (10000) rather than thousands (1000) as is common in Europe and North America.     [ edit ]   Speech levels and honorifics   Main article:  Korean honorifics   The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean, and the grammar reflects this. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject referent is reflected in  honorifics , while that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in  speech level .     [ edit ]   Honorifics   When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a younger stranger, student, employee or the like. Nowadays, there are special endings which can be used on declarative, interrogative, and imperative sentences; and both honorific or normal sentences. They are made for easier and faster use of Korean.     [ edit ]   Speech levels   There are seven verb  paradigms  or  speech levels  in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation. [ citation needed ]  Unlike  honorifics   which are used to show respect towards the referent   speech levels  are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience. The names of the 7 levels are derived from the non-honorific  imperative  form of the verb    ( hada , ""do"") in each level, plus the suffix  ('che',  hanja :   ), which means ""style.""   The highest 6 levels are generally grouped together as  jondaenmal  (), while the lowest level ( haeche , ) is called  banmal  () in Korean.     [ edit ]   Vocabulary   The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words. Like Japanese and Vietnamese, more than 50% of the vocabulary (up to 60% by some estimates), especially words that denote abstract ideas, are  Sino-Korean words , [ 7 ]  either     directly borrowed from  Written Chinese , or   coined in Japan or Korea using  Chinese characters ,     in a similar way European languages borrow from Latin and Greek. Korean has two  number systems : one native, and one borrowed from Chinese.   To a much lesser extent, words have also occasionally been borrowed from  Mongolian ,  Sanskrit , and other languages. Conversely, the Korean language itself has also contributed some loanwords to other languages, most notably the  Tsushima dialect  of Japanese.   The vast majority of loanwords other than Sino-Korean come from modern times, 90% of which are from  English . [ 8 ]  Many words have also been borrowed from  Japanese  and  Western languages  such as  German  ( areubaiteu  part-time job,  allereugi  allergy). Some Western words were borrowed indirectly via Japanese, taking a Japanese sound pattern, for example dozen >     dsu  >     daseu . Most indirect Western borrowings are now written according to current Hangulization rules for the respective Western language, as if borrowed directly. There are a few more complicated borrowings such as German(y) (see  Names for Germany ), the first part of whose  endonym   [d.lant]  the Japanese approximated using the  kanji      doitsu  that were then accepted into the Korean language by their Sino-Korean pronunciation:     dok  +     il  =  Dogil . In South Korean official use, a number of other Sino-Korean country names have been replaced with phonetically oriented Hangulizations of the countries' endonyms or English names.   North Korean vocabulary shows a tendency to prefer native Korean over Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings, especially with recent political objectives aimed at eliminating foreign (mostly Chinese) influences on the Korean language in the North. By contrast, South Korean may have several Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings which tend to be absent in North Korean.     [ edit ]   Writing system       Korean writing systems           Hangul       Hanja       Hyangchal   Gugyeol   Idu       Mixed script       Korean romanization       Revised Romanization of Korean   McCune-Reischauer   Yale Romanization           Main article:  Hangul   See also:  Hangul consonant and vowel tables   In ancient times, the languages of the Korean peninsula were written using  Chinese characters , using  hyangchal  or  idu . Such systems were not popular because hanja is not well suited to the Korean language. Its use is now limited.   Korean is now mainly written in Hangul, the Korean alphabet promulgated in 1446 by  Sejong the Great ;  hanja may be mixed in  to write  Sino-Korean words . South Korea still teaches 1800 hanja characters in its schools, while the North abolished the use of hanja decades ago.   Below is a chart of the Korean alphabet's symbols and their canonical  IPA  values:     Consonants     Hangul                                                                        RR   b , p   d , t   j   g , k   pp   tt   jj   kk   p   t   ch   k   s   h   ss   m   n   ng       r , l           IPA   p   t      k   p   t      k   p   t      k   s   h   s   m   n      w   r   j         Vowels     Hangul                                                                      RR   i   e   oe   ae   a   o   u   eo   eu   ui   ye   yae   ya   yo   yu   yeo   wi   we   wae   wa   wo       IPA   i   e         a   o   u         i   je   j   ja   jo   ju   j   wi   we   w   wa   w       Modern Korean is written with  spaces  between  words , a feature not found in Chinese or Japanese. Korean  punctuation  marks are almost identical to Western ones. Traditionally, Korean was written in columns from top to bottom, right to left, but is now usually written in rows from left to right, top to bottom.     [ edit ]   Differences between North Korean and South Korean   Main article:  Korean language North-South differences   The Korean language used in the North and the South exhibits differences in pronunciation, spelling, grammar and vocabulary. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Pronunciation   In North Korea,  palatalization  of  /si/  is optional, and  //  can be pronounced as  [z]  in between vowels.   Words that are written the same way may be pronounced differently, such as the examples below. The pronunciations below are given in  Revised Romanization ,  McCune-Reischauer  and Hangul, the last of which represents what the Hangul would be if one writes the word as pronounced.       Word   Meaning   Pronunciation       North (RR/MR)   North (Hangul)   South (RR/MR)   South (Hangul)          wide   neo p tta (n p ta)      neo l tta (n l ta)             to read  (continuative form)   i l kko (i l ko)      i l kko (i l ko)             Amnok River   am r okgang (am r okkang)      am n okkang (am n okkang)             independence   dong r ip (tong r ip)      dong n ip (tong n ip)             idea / sense / conception   gwa ll yeom (kwa ll ym)      gwa nn yeom (kwa nn ym)          *   innovative   hyeoksin jj eok (hyksin tch k)      hyeoksin j eok (hyksin j k)          * Similar pronunciation is used in the North whenever the hanja """" is attached to a Sino-Korean word ending in ,  or . (In the South, this rule only applies when it is attached to any single-character Sino-Korean word.)     [ edit ]   Spelling   Some words are spelled differently by the North and the South, but the pronunciations are the same.       Word spelling   Meaning   Pronunciation (RR/MR)   Remarks       North   South             sunshine   haeppit (haepit)   The ""sai siot"" ('' used for indicating sound change) is almost never written out in the North.             cherry blossom   beotkkot (ptkkot)                cannot read   monnikda (monnikta)   Spacing.             Hallasan   hallasan (hallasan)   When a - combination is pronounced as  ll , the original Hangul spelling is kept in the North, while the Hangul is changed in the South.             rules   gyuyul (kyuyul)   In words where the original hanja is spelt """" or """" and follows a vowel, the initial  is not pronounced in the North, making the pronunciation identical with that in the South where the  is dropped in the spelling.         [ edit ]   Spelling and pronunciation   Some words have different spellings and pronunciations in the North and the South, some of which were given in the ""Phonology"" section above:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          ryeongryang (ryngryang)      yeongnyang (yngnyang)   strength   Korean words originally starting in  r  or  n  have their  r  or  n  dropped in the South Korean version if the sound following it is an  i  or  y  sound.          rodong (rodong)      nodong (nodong)   work   Korean words originally starting in  r  have their  r  changed to  n  in the South Korean version if the sound following it is a sound other than  i  or  y .          wonssu (wnssu)      wonsu (wnsu)   mortal enemy   ""Mortal enemy"" and ""head of state"" are homophones in the South. Possibly to avoid referring to  Kim Il-sung  /  Kim Jong-il  as the enemy, the second syllable of ""enemy"" is written and pronounced  in the North.          rajio (rajio)      radio (radio)   radio            u (u)      wi (wi)   on; above            anhae (anhae)      anae (anae)   wife            kkuba (kkuba)      kuba (k'uba)   Cuba   When transcribing foreign words from languages that do not have contrasts between aspirated and unaspirated stops, North Koreans generally use tensed stops for the unaspirated ones while South Koreans use aspirated stops in both cases.          pe (p'e)      pye (p'ye), pe (p'e)   lungs   All hanja pronounced as  pye  ( p'ye ) or  pe  ( p'e ) in the South are pronounced as  pe  ( p'e ) in the North. The spelling is also accordingly different.       In general, when transcribing place names, North Korea tends to use the pronunciation in the original language more than South Korea, which often uses the pronunciation in English. For example:       Original name   North Korea transliteration   English name   South Korea transliteration       Spelling   Pronunciation   Spelling   Pronunciaton       Ulaanbaatar      ullanbattareu (ullanbattar)   Ulan Bator      ullanbatoreu (ullanbat'or)       Kbenhavn      koeppenhabeun (k'oeppenhabn)   Copenhagen      kopenhagen (k'op'enhagen)       al-Qhirah      kkahira (kkahira)   Cairo      kairo (k'airo)         [ edit ]   Grammar   Some grammatical constructions are also different:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          doeyeotda (toeytta)      doeeotda (toetta)   past tense of  (doeda/toeda), ""to become""   All similar grammar forms of verbs or adjectives that end in  in the stem (i.e. , , , ,  and ) in the North use  instead of the South's .          gomawayo (komawayo)      gomawoyo (komawyo)   thanks   -irregular verbs in the North use  (wa) for all those with a positive ending vowel; this only happens in the South if the verb stem has only one syllable.          halgayo (halkayo)      halkkayo (halkkayo)   Shall we do?   Although the Hangul differ, the pronunciations are the same (i.e. with the tensed  sound).         [ edit ]   Vocabulary   Some vocabulary is different between the North and the South:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          munhwajutaek (munhwajut'aek)      apateu (ap'at')   Apartment     (appateu/appat') is also used in the North.          joseonmal (chosnmal)      han-gugeo(han'gugeo)   Korean language            gwakbap (kwakpap)      dosirak (tosirak)   lunch box           [ edit ]   Others   In the North,  guillemets     and    are the symbols used for quotes; in the South, quotation marks equivalent to the English ones,  and , are standard, although     and     are sometimes used in popular novels.     [ edit ]   Study by non-native speakers   The  United States '  Defense Language Institute  classifies Korean alongside  Arabic ,  Chinese , and  Japanese  as a Category IV language, meaning that 63 weeks of instruction (as compared to just 25 weeks for  French ,  Spanish ,  Portuguese , and  Italian ) are required to bring an English-speaking student to a limited working level of proficiency in which he or she has ""sufficient capability to meet routine social demands and limited job requirements"" and ""can deal with concrete topics in past, present, and future tense."" [ 10 ]  As a result, the study of the Korean language in the United States is dominated by  Korean American  heritage language students; they are estimated to form over 80% of all students of the language at non-military universities. [ 11 ]   However, Korean is considerably easier for speakers of certain other languages, such as Japanese, Mongolian and Turkic languages; in Japan, it is more widely studied by non-heritage learners. [ 12 ]  The  Korean Language Proficiency Test , an examination aimed at assessing non-native speakers' competence in Korean, was instituted in 1997; 17,000 people applied for the 2005 sitting of the examination.

Korean  (  /  , see  below ) is the official  language  of  North Korea  and  South Korea . It is also one of the two official languages in the  Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture  in  China . There are about 78 million Korean speakers. It was formerly written using  Hanja , borrowed  Chinese characters  pronounced in the Korean way. In the 15th century a national writing system was developed by  Sejong the Great , nowadays called  Hangul .   The genealogical  classification  of the Korean language is debated. Some linguists place it in the  Altaic  language family, while others consider it to be a  language isolate . It is  agglutinative  in its morphology and  SOV  in its  syntax .

In South Korea, the language is most often called  Hangungmal  (  ;   ), or more formally,  Hangugeo  (  ;   ) or  Gugeo  (  ;   ; literally ""national language"").   In North Korea and Yanbian in China, the language is most often called  Chosnmal  (  ; with  hanja :   ), or more formally,  Chosn  (  ;   ).   On the other hand, Korean people in the  former USSR , who refer to themselves as  Koryo-saram  (also  Goryeoin  [  ;   ; literally, "" Goryeo  person(s)""]) call the language  Goryeomal  (  ;   ).   In  mainland China , following the establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992, the term  Choxiny  (   or short form:  Choy  (  )) has normally been used to refer to the language spoken in North Korea and Yanbian, while  Hnguy  (   or short form:  Hny  (  )) is used to refer to the language spoken in South Korea.   Some older English sources also used the name ""Korean"" to refer to the language, country, and people.     [ edit ]   History   Main article:  History of the Korean language   Korean is descended from  Old Korean  and  Middle Korean .     [ edit ]   Classification   The classification of the modern Korean language is uncertain, and due to the lack of any one generally accepted theory, it is sometimes described conservatively as a  language isolate .   On the other hand, since the publication of the article of  Ramstedt  in 1926, many linguists support the hypothesis that Korean can be classified as an  Altaic  language, or as a relative of proto-Altaic. Korean is similar to Altaic languages in that they both lack certain grammatical elements, including  number ,  gender ,  articles , fusional morphology, voice, and  relative pronouns  (Kim Namkil). Korean especially bears some  morphological  resemblance to some languages of the Northern Turkic group, namely  Sakha (Yakut) . Vinokurova, a scholar of the Sakha language, noted that like in Korean, and unlike in other  Turkic languages  or a variety of other languages surveyed, adverbs in Sakha are derived from verbs with the help of derivational morphology; however, she did not suggest this implied any relation between the two languages. [ 2 ]   It is also considered likely that Korean is related in some way to  Japanese , since the two languages have nearly identical grammatical structures, and share a number of possible phonological cognates (though a majority of them are likely due to local pronunciations of the Chinese characters from which they are derived), as noted by such researchers as  Samuel E. Martin  and  Roy Andrew Miller  in the late 1960s.  Sergei Starostin  (1991) found about 25% of potential cognates in the Japanese-Korean 100-word  Swadesh list , which places these two languages closer together than other possible members of the Altaic family. [ 3 ]   Genetic relationships have been postulated both directly and indirectly, the latter either through placing both languages in the Altaic family, or by arguing for a relationship between Japanese and the  Buyeo languages  of  Goguryeo  and  Baekje  (see below); the proposed Baekje relationship is supported by cognates such as Baekje  mir , Japanese  mi-  ""three"". [ 4 ]   The possible relationship between Korean and Japanese can be exemplified by such basic vocabularly items as J.     mizu  (Old J.  midu ) : K.     mul  (Middle K.  mirh ) ""water"",  mot  ""lake""; J.     ku-ru  ""come"" (Old J.  ku , also cf. irregular root changes as in past tense   ki-ta , negative   ko-nai  in Modern J.) : K.     ka-da  (""go""); J.     kata-i  ""hard"" (whence     kata-na  ""knife, sword"") : K.  kud-yn  (hard); J.     i-ru  ""to be"" (past tense   i-ta ) : K.     i-da  ""to be""; J.  na ,  -en  : K.  anh  ""not"", J.  minna  (Old J.  mynna ) ""all, everyone"" : K.  manh-  ""many"" (predicate  mana-da ), etc.  [ 5 ] . The same possible cognates are often observed in other members of the potential  Altaic family , esp. in the  Tungusic languages . Cf. Nanay  mue  ""water"",  giagda-  ""to walk"",  anaa, anna  ""not"".   Others argue, however, that the similarities are not due to any genetic relationship, but rather to a  sprachbund  effect. [ citation needed ]  See  East Asian languages  for morphological features shared among languages of the East Asian  sprachbund , and  Classification of Japanese  for further details on the possible relationship. Though it is very difficult to believe words such as ""water"", ""to be"", and ""to go"" arise from sprachbund effects.   It is presumed that modern Korean may be more closely related to the languages of  Samhan  and  Silla  than the Buyeo languages; many Korean scholars believe they were mutually intelligible, and the collective basis of what in the  Goryeo  period would merge to become Middle Korean (the language before the changes that the  Seven-Year War  brought) and eventually Modern Korean. The  Jeju dialect  preserves some archaic features that can also be found in Middle Korean, whose  arae a  is retained in the dialect as a distinct vowel.   There are also more marginal hypotheses proposing various other relationships; for example, a few scholars, such as  Homer B. Hulbert  (1905), have tried to relate Korean to the  Dravidian languages  through the similar syntax in both. [ 6 ]   Though not related to Chinese, it has borrowed heavily; see the Vocabulary section below.     [ edit ]   Dialects   Main article:  Korean dialects          Dialects of Korean       Korean has several  dialects  (called  mal  [literally ""speech""],  saturi , or  bang-eon  in Korean). The  standard language  ( pyojuneo  or  pyojunmal ) of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  P'yngyang . All dialects of Korean are similar to each other, and are in fact all mutually intelligible, perhaps with the exception of the dialect of  Jeju Island  (see  Jeju dialect ). The dialect spoken in Jeju is in fact classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of  Seoul dialect  use very little stress, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of the  Gyeongsang dialect  have a very pronounced intonation.   It is also worth noting that there is substantial evidence for a history of extensive  dialect levelling , or even  convergent evolution  or intermixture of two or more originally distinct linguistic stocks, within the Korean language and its dialects. Many Korean dialects have basic vocabulary that is etymologically distinct from vocabulary of identical meaning in Standard Korean or other dialects, such as South Jeolla dialect /kur/ vs. Standard Korean     /ip/  ""mouth"" or Gyeongsang dialect  /.u.i/  vs. Standard Korean  /puu/  "" garlic chives ."" This suggests that the Korean Peninsula may have at one time been much more linguistically diverse than it is at present. See also the  Buyeo languages   hypothesis .   There is a very close connection between the dialects of Korean and the  regions of Korea , since the boundaries of both are largely determined by mountains and seas. Here is a list of traditional dialect names and locations:       Standard dialect   Where used       Seoul   Seoul  (),  Incheon  (/), most of  Gyeonggi  (/)       P'yngan  (/)   P'yngyang ,  P'yngan  region,  Chagang  (North Korea)       Regional dialect   Where used       Gyeonggi   limited areas of the  Gyeonggi  region (South Korea)       Chungcheong   Daejeon ,  Chungcheong  region (South Korea)       Gangwon   Gangwon-do (South Korea) / Kangwn (North Korea)       Gyeongsang   Busan ,  Daegu ,  Ulsan ,  Gyeongsang  region (South Korea)       Hamgyng   Rasn ,  Hamgyng  region,  Ryanggang  (North Korea)       Hwanghae   Hwanghae  region (North Korea)       Jeju   Jeju Island/Province  (South Korea)       Jeolla   Gwangju ,  Jeolla  region (South Korea)         [ edit ]   Phonology       This article contains  IPA  phonetic symbols.  Without proper  rendering support , you may see  question marks, boxes, or other symbols  instead of  Unicode  characters.       Main article:  Korean phonology     [ edit ]   Consonants          The Korean consonants             Bilabial   Alveolar   Post-  alveolar   Velar   Glottal       Nasal      /m/      /n/        //  (syllable-final)         Plosive  and   Affricate   plain      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         tense      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         aspirated      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         Fricative   plain        /s/          /h/       tense        /s/             Liquid        /l/           The  IPA  symbol <  > (a subscript double straight quotation mark, shown here with a placeholder circle) is used to denote the tensed consonants  /p/, /t/, /k/, //, /s/ . Its official use in the  Extensions to the IPA  is for  'strong'  articulation, but is used in the literature for  faucalized voice . The Korean consonants also have elements of  stiff voice , but it is not yet known how typical this is of faucalized consonants. They are produced with a partially constricted  glottis  and additional subglottal pressure in addition to tense vocal tract walls, laryngeal lowering, or other expansion of the larynx.     [ edit ]   Vowels                    The Korean basic vowels                 Monophthongs   /i/    ,  /e/    ,  //    ,  /a/    ,  /o/    ,  /u/    ,  //    ,  //    ,  //          Vowels preceded by intermediaries,  or Diphthongs   /je/    ,  /j/    ,  /ja/    ,  /wi/    ,  /we/    ,  /w/    ,  /wa/    ,  /i/    ,  /jo/    ,  /ju/    ,  /j/    ,  /w/            [ edit ]   Allophones   /s/  becomes an  alveolo-palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i]  for most speakers (but see  Differences in the language between North Korea and South Korea ). This occurs with the tense fricative and all the affricates as well. At the end of a syllable, /s/ changes to /t/ (Example: beoseot () 'mushroom').   /h/  may become a  bilabial   []  before  [o]  or  [u] , a  palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i] , a  velar   [x]  before  [] , a voiced  []  between voiced sounds, and a  [h]  elsewhere. [ citation needed ]   /p, t, , k/  become voiced  [b, d, , ]  between voiced sounds.   /l/  becomes alveolar flap  []  between vowels, and  [l]  or  []  at the end of a syllable or next to another  /l/ . Note that a written syllable-final '', when followed by a vowel or a glide ( i.e. , when the next character starts with ''), migrates to the next syllable and thus becomes  [] .   Traditionally,  /l/  was disallowed at the beginning of a word. It disappeared before  [j] , and otherwise became  /n/ . However, the inflow of western loanword changed the trend, and now word-initial  /l/  (mostly from English loanwords) are pronounced as a free variation of either  []  or  [l] . The traditional prohibition of word-initial  /l/  became a morphological rule called ""initial law"" () in South Korea, which pertains to Sino-Korean vocabulary. Such words retain their word-initial  /l/  in North Korea.   All  obstruents  (plosives, affricates, fricatives) are  unreleased   [p, t, k]  at the end of a word.   Plosive stops  /p, t, k/  become nasal stops  [m, n, ]  before nasal stops.   Hangul  spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying, partly historical  morphology . Given this, it is sometimes hard to tell which actual phonemes are present in a certain word.   One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial  [r] , and initial  [n] . For example,     ""labour"" - north:  r odong  (), south:  n odong  ()   ""history"" - north:  ry ksa  (), south:  y eoksa  ()   ""female"" - north:  ny ja  (), south:  y eoja  ()       [ edit ]   Morphophonemics   Grammatical morphemes may change shape depending on the preceding sounds. Examples include  -eun/-neun  (-/-) and  -i/-ga  (-/-). Sometimes sounds may be inserted instead. Examples include  -eul/-reul  (-/-),  -euro/-ro  (-/-),  -eseo/-seo  (-/-),  -ideunji/-deunji  (-/-) and  -iya/-ya  (-/-). However,  -euro/-ro  is somewhat irregular, since it will behave differently after a rieul consonant.     Korean particles     After a consonant   After a rieul   After a vowel       -ui  (-)       -eun  (-)   -neun  (-)       -i  (-)   -ga  (-)       -eul  (-)   -reul  (-)       -gwa  (-)   -wa  (-)       -euro  (-)   -ro  (-)       Some verbs may also change shape morphophonemically.     [ edit ]   Grammar   Main article:  Korean grammar     [ edit ]   Sentence structure   Korean is an  agglutinative language . Modifiers generally follow the modified word, and in the case of verb modifiers, can be serially appended. The basic form of a Korean sentence is  Subject Object Verb , but the verb is the only required and immovable element.       A :       -       -? (?)           kage-e     kasseo-yo           store + [location marker ()]     [go (verb root) ()]+[conjunctive ()]+[past ()]+[conjunctive ()]+ [polite marker ()]         ""Did [you] go to the store?"" (with ""you"" implied by context)         B :       .           ye           yes         ""Yes.""       [ edit ]   Parts of speech     [ edit ]   Verb   Korean  verbs  (  ,  tongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""action verbs"" or ""dynamic verbs"" to distinguish them from [  () ,  hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""]), which are also known as ""descriptive verbs"" or ""stative verbs"". Examples of action/dynamic verbs include    ( hada , ""to do"") and    ( kada , ""to go"") which constitute an action or movement as opposed to descriptive verbs such as    ( yehppeuda , ""to be beautiful""). For a larger list of Korean verbs, see  wikt:Category:Korean verbs .   Unlike most of the European languages, Korean does not conjugate verbs using agreement with the subject, and nouns have no gender. Instead, verb conjugations depend upon the verb tense, aspect, mood, and the social relation between the speaker, the subjects, and the listeners. The system of speech levels and honorifics loosely resembles the  T-V distinction  of most  Indo-European languages . For example, different endings are used based on the speaker's relation with the person they are talking to or the person about which they are talking. Politeness is a critical part of Korean language and Korean culture, therefore, when talking to someone esteemed, the correct verb ending, which should have a lot of respect, must be chosen.     [ edit ]   Adjective   Words categorized as Korean  adjectives  (  ,  hyeong-yongsa ,   ) conjugate similarly to verbs, so some English texts call them ""descriptive verbs"" or "" stative verbs "", but they are distinctly separate from    ( tongsa ).   English does not have an identical grammatical category, so the English translation of Korean adjectives may misleadingly suggest that they are verbs. For example,    ( pukda ) translates literally as ""to be red"" and    ( aswipda ) often best translates as ""to lack"" or ""to want for"", but both are    ( hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""). For a larger list of Korean adjectives, see  wikt:Category:Korean adjectives .     [ edit ]   Determiner   Korean  determiners  (  ,  gwanhyeongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""determinatives"", ""adnominals"", ""pre-nouns"", ""attributives"", and ""unconjugated adjectives"". Examples include    ( kak , ""each""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean determiners .     [ edit ]   Noun   A large body of Korean  nouns  (  ,  myeongsa ,   ) stem from  Chinese characters , e.g.    (,  san , mountain),    (,  yeok , station),    (,  munhwa , culture), etc. Others are native to the Korean language, e.g.    ( nara , country),    ( nal , day). Many  Sino-Korean words  have a native Korean equivalent and vice versa, but not always. Nouns do not have  grammatical gender  and can be made  plural  by adding  to the end of the word, however in most instances the  singular  form is used even when in English it would be translated as plural. For example, while in English the sentence  ""there are three apples""  would use the plural  ""apples""  instead of the singular  ""apple"" , the Korean sentence    ( sagwa segae isssumnida ) maintains the word  ( sagwa , ""apple"") in its singular form, thus rendered in English as ""apple three(things) exist."" For a list of Korean nouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean nouns .     [ edit ]   Pronoun   Main article:  Korean pronouns   Korean  pronouns  (  ,  daemyeongsa ,   ) are highly influenced by the honorifics in the language. Pronouns change forms depending on the social status of the person or persons spoken to, e.g. the pronoun for ""I"" there is both the informal    ( na ) and the honorific/humble    ( jeo ). In general second person singular pronouns are avoided, especially when using honorific forms. For a larger list or Korean pronouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean pronouns .     [ edit ]   Adverb   Korean  adverbs  (  ,  busa ,   ) include    ( tto , ""also"") and    ( gadeuk , ""fully""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean adverbs .     [ edit ]   Particle   Korean  particles  (  ,  josa ,   ) are also known in English as "" postpositions "". Examples include    ( neun , topic marker) and    ( reul , object marker). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean particles .     [ edit ]   Interjection   Korean  interjections  (  ,  gamtansa ,   ) are also known in English as ""exclamations"". Examples include    ( ani , ""no""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean interjections .     [ edit ]   Number   Main article:  Korean numerals   Korean  numbers  or numerals (  ,  sutja ,   ) consitute two regularly used sets: a native Korean set and a  Sino-Korean  set. The Sino-Korean system is nearly entirely based on the  Chinese numerals . The distinction between the two numeral systems is very important. Everything that can be counted will use one of the two systems, but seldom both. Sino-Korean words are sometimes used to mark ordinal usage: yeol beon ( ) means ""ten times"" while sip beon (() ()) means ""number ten."" The grouping of large numbers in Korean follow the Chinese tradition of myriads (10000) rather than thousands (1000) as is common in Europe and North America.     [ edit ]   Speech levels and honorifics   Main article:  Korean honorifics   The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean, and the grammar reflects this. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject referent is reflected in  honorifics , while that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in  speech level .     [ edit ]   Honorifics   When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a younger stranger, student, employee or the like. Nowadays, there are special endings which can be used on declarative, interrogative, and imperative sentences; and both honorific or normal sentences. They are made for easier and faster use of Korean.     [ edit ]   Speech levels   There are seven verb  paradigms  or  speech levels  in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation. [ citation needed ]  Unlike  honorifics   which are used to show respect towards the referent   speech levels  are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience. The names of the 7 levels are derived from the non-honorific  imperative  form of the verb    ( hada , ""do"") in each level, plus the suffix  ('che',  hanja :   ), which means ""style.""   The highest 6 levels are generally grouped together as  jondaenmal  (), while the lowest level ( haeche , ) is called  banmal  () in Korean.     [ edit ]   Vocabulary   The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words. Like Japanese and Vietnamese, more than 50% of the vocabulary (up to 60% by some estimates), especially words that denote abstract ideas, are  Sino-Korean words , [ 7 ]  either     directly borrowed from  Written Chinese , or   coined in Japan or Korea using  Chinese characters ,     in a similar way European languages borrow from Latin and Greek. Korean has two  number systems : one native, and one borrowed from Chinese.   To a much lesser extent, words have also occasionally been borrowed from  Mongolian ,  Sanskrit , and other languages. Conversely, the Korean language itself has also contributed some loanwords to other languages, most notably the  Tsushima dialect  of Japanese.   The vast majority of loanwords other than Sino-Korean come from modern times, 90% of which are from  English . [ 8 ]  Many words have also been borrowed from  Japanese  and  Western languages  such as  German  ( areubaiteu  part-time job,  allereugi  allergy). Some Western words were borrowed indirectly via Japanese, taking a Japanese sound pattern, for example dozen >     dsu  >     daseu . Most indirect Western borrowings are now written according to current Hangulization rules for the respective Western language, as if borrowed directly. There are a few more complicated borrowings such as German(y) (see  Names for Germany ), the first part of whose  endonym   [d.lant]  the Japanese approximated using the  kanji      doitsu  that were then accepted into the Korean language by their Sino-Korean pronunciation:     dok  +     il  =  Dogil . In South Korean official use, a number of other Sino-Korean country names have been replaced with phonetically oriented Hangulizations of the countries' endonyms or English names.   North Korean vocabulary shows a tendency to prefer native Korean over Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings, especially with recent political objectives aimed at eliminating foreign (mostly Chinese) influences on the Korean language in the North. By contrast, South Korean may have several Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings which tend to be absent in North Korean.     [ edit ]   Writing system       Korean writing systems           Hangul       Hanja       Hyangchal   Gugyeol   Idu       Mixed script       Korean romanization       Revised Romanization of Korean   McCune-Reischauer   Yale Romanization           Main article:  Hangul   See also:  Hangul consonant and vowel tables   In ancient times, the languages of the Korean peninsula were written using  Chinese characters , using  hyangchal  or  idu . Such systems were not popular because hanja is not well suited to the Korean language. Its use is now limited.   Korean is now mainly written in Hangul, the Korean alphabet promulgated in 1446 by  Sejong the Great ;  hanja may be mixed in  to write  Sino-Korean words . South Korea still teaches 1800 hanja characters in its schools, while the North abolished the use of hanja decades ago.   Below is a chart of the Korean alphabet's symbols and their canonical  IPA  values:     Consonants     Hangul                                                                        RR   b , p   d , t   j   g , k   pp   tt   jj   kk   p   t   ch   k   s   h   ss   m   n   ng       r , l           IPA   p   t      k   p   t      k   p   t      k   s   h   s   m   n      w   r   j         Vowels     Hangul                                                                      RR   i   e   oe   ae   a   o   u   eo   eu   ui   ye   yae   ya   yo   yu   yeo   wi   we   wae   wa   wo       IPA   i   e         a   o   u         i   je   j   ja   jo   ju   j   wi   we   w   wa   w       Modern Korean is written with  spaces  between  words , a feature not found in Chinese or Japanese. Korean  punctuation  marks are almost identical to Western ones. Traditionally, Korean was written in columns from top to bottom, right to left, but is now usually written in rows from left to right, top to bottom.     [ edit ]   Differences between North Korean and South Korean   Main article:  Korean language North-South differences   The Korean language used in the North and the South exhibits differences in pronunciation, spelling, grammar and vocabulary. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Pronunciation   In North Korea,  palatalization  of  /si/  is optional, and  //  can be pronounced as  [z]  in between vowels.   Words that are written the same way may be pronounced differently, such as the examples below. The pronunciations below are given in  Revised Romanization ,  McCune-Reischauer  and Hangul, the last of which represents what the Hangul would be if one writes the word as pronounced.       Word   Meaning   Pronunciation       North (RR/MR)   North (Hangul)   South (RR/MR)   South (Hangul)          wide   neo p tta (n p ta)      neo l tta (n l ta)             to read  (continuative form)   i l kko (i l ko)      i l kko (i l ko)             Amnok River   am r okgang (am r okkang)      am n okkang (am n okkang)             independence   dong r ip (tong r ip)      dong n ip (tong n ip)             idea / sense / conception   gwa ll yeom (kwa ll ym)      gwa nn yeom (kwa nn ym)          *   innovative   hyeoksin jj eok (hyksin tch k)      hyeoksin j eok (hyksin j k)          * Similar pronunciation is used in the North whenever the hanja """" is attached to a Sino-Korean word ending in ,  or . (In the South, this rule only applies when it is attached to any single-character Sino-Korean word.)     [ edit ]   Spelling   Some words are spelled differently by the North and the South, but the pronunciations are the same.       Word spelling   Meaning   Pronunciation (RR/MR)   Remarks       North   South             sunshine   haeppit (haepit)   The ""sai siot"" ('' used for indicating sound change) is almost never written out in the North.             cherry blossom   beotkkot (ptkkot)                cannot read   monnikda (monnikta)   Spacing.             Hallasan   hallasan (hallasan)   When a - combination is pronounced as  ll , the original Hangul spelling is kept in the North, while the Hangul is changed in the South.             rules   gyuyul (kyuyul)   In words where the original hanja is spelt """" or """" and follows a vowel, the initial  is not pronounced in the North, making the pronunciation identical with that in the South where the  is dropped in the spelling.         [ edit ]   Spelling and pronunciation   Some words have different spellings and pronunciations in the North and the South, some of which were given in the ""Phonology"" section above:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          ryeongryang (ryngryang)      yeongnyang (yngnyang)   strength   Korean words originally starting in  r  or  n  have their  r  or  n  dropped in the South Korean version if the sound following it is an  i  or  y  sound.          rodong (rodong)      nodong (nodong)   work   Korean words originally starting in  r  have their  r  changed to  n  in the South Korean version if the sound following it is a sound other than  i  or  y .          wonssu (wnssu)      wonsu (wnsu)   mortal enemy   ""Mortal enemy"" and ""head of state"" are homophones in the South. Possibly to avoid referring to  Kim Il-sung  /  Kim Jong-il  as the enemy, the second syllable of ""enemy"" is written and pronounced  in the North.          rajio (rajio)      radio (radio)   radio            u (u)      wi (wi)   on; above            anhae (anhae)      anae (anae)   wife            kkuba (kkuba)      kuba (k'uba)   Cuba   When transcribing foreign words from languages that do not have contrasts between aspirated and unaspirated stops, North Koreans generally use tensed stops for the unaspirated ones while South Koreans use aspirated stops in both cases.          pe (p'e)      pye (p'ye), pe (p'e)   lungs   All hanja pronounced as  pye  ( p'ye ) or  pe  ( p'e ) in the South are pronounced as  pe  ( p'e ) in the North. The spelling is also accordingly different.       In general, when transcribing place names, North Korea tends to use the pronunciation in the original language more than South Korea, which often uses the pronunciation in English. For example:       Original name   North Korea transliteration   English name   South Korea transliteration       Spelling   Pronunciation   Spelling   Pronunciaton       Ulaanbaatar      ullanbattareu (ullanbattar)   Ulan Bator      ullanbatoreu (ullanbat'or)       Kbenhavn      koeppenhabeun (k'oeppenhabn)   Copenhagen      kopenhagen (k'op'enhagen)       al-Qhirah      kkahira (kkahira)   Cairo      kairo (k'airo)         [ edit ]   Grammar   Some grammatical constructions are also different:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          doeyeotda (toeytta)      doeeotda (toetta)   past tense of  (doeda/toeda), ""to become""   All similar grammar forms of verbs or adjectives that end in  in the stem (i.e. , , , ,  and ) in the North use  instead of the South's .          gomawayo (komawayo)      gomawoyo (komawyo)   thanks   -irregular verbs in the North use  (wa) for all those with a positive ending vowel; this only happens in the South if the verb stem has only one syllable.          halgayo (halkayo)      halkkayo (halkkayo)   Shall we do?   Although the Hangul differ, the pronunciations are the same (i.e. with the tensed  sound).         [ edit ]   Vocabulary   Some vocabulary is different between the North and the South:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          munhwajutaek (munhwajut'aek)      apateu (ap'at')   Apartment     (appateu/appat') is also used in the North.          joseonmal (chosnmal)      han-gugeo(han'gugeo)   Korean language            gwakbap (kwakpap)      dosirak (tosirak)   lunch box           [ edit ]   Others   In the North,  guillemets     and    are the symbols used for quotes; in the South, quotation marks equivalent to the English ones,  and , are standard, although     and     are sometimes used in popular novels.     [ edit ]   Study by non-native speakers   The  United States '  Defense Language Institute  classifies Korean alongside  Arabic ,  Chinese , and  Japanese  as a Category IV language, meaning that 63 weeks of instruction (as compared to just 25 weeks for  French ,  Spanish ,  Portuguese , and  Italian ) are required to bring an English-speaking student to a limited working level of proficiency in which he or she has ""sufficient capability to meet routine social demands and limited job requirements"" and ""can deal with concrete topics in past, present, and future tense."" [ 10 ]  As a result, the study of the Korean language in the United States is dominated by  Korean American  heritage language students; they are estimated to form over 80% of all students of the language at non-military universities. [ 11 ]   However, Korean is considerably easier for speakers of certain other languages, such as Japanese, Mongolian and Turkic languages; in Japan, it is more widely studied by non-heritage learners. [ 12 ]  The  Korean Language Proficiency Test , an examination aimed at assessing non-native speakers' competence in Korean, was instituted in 1997; 17,000 people applied for the 2005 sitting of the examination.

This article is mainly about the native Korean writing system. See  Korean language  for details on the Korean spoken language.     Hangul  (pronounced  /hl/ , or Korean    [hanl]   ( help  info ) , in  Korean :   Hangeul/Han'gl  (in South Korea) or   Chosn'gl/Joseongeul  (in North Korea)) is the native  alphabet  of the  Korean language , as distinguished from the  logographic   Sino-Korean   hanja  system. It was created in the mid-fifteenth century, and is now the official  script  of both  North Korea  and  South Korea , being  co-official  in the  Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture  of  China .   Hangul is a  phonemic  alphabet organized into  syllabic  blocks. Each block consists of at least two of the 24 Hangul letters  ( jamo ) , with at least one each of the 14  consonants  and 10  vowels . These syllabic blocks can be written horizontally from left to right as well as vertically from top to bottom in columns from right to left. Originally, the alphabet had several additional letters  (see  obsolete jamo ) . For a phonological description of the letters, see  Korean phonology .

Han  (  ) meant ""great"" in archaic Korean, while  geul  (  ) is the native Korean word for ""script"".  Han  could also be understood as the  Sino-Korean  word  ""Korean"", so that the name can be read ""Korean script"" as well as ""great script"". [ 2 ]     is pronounced  /hanl/  and would be  romanized  in one of the following ways:    Hangeul  or  han-geul  in the  Revised Romanization of Korean , which the  South Korean  government uses in all English publications and encourages for all purposes.   Han'gl  in the  McCune-Reischauer  system. When used as an English word, it is often rendered without the  diacritics :  hangul,  often capitalized as  Hangul.  This is how it appears in many English dictionaries.   Hankul  in  Yale Romanization , a system recommended for technical linguistic studies.       North Koreans  prefer to call it  Chosn'gl  (  ), for reasons related to the different  names of Korea .   The original name was  Hunminjeongeum  (; ; see  history ).  Due to objections to the names  Hangeul,   Chosn'gl,  and  urigeul  () (see below) by the Korean minority in  Manchuria , the otherwise uncommon short form  jeongeum  may be used as a neutral name in some international contexts.       [ edit ]   Other names   Until the early twentieth century, Hangul was denigrated as vulgar by the literate elite who preferred the traditional hanja writing system. [ 3 ]  They gave it such names as:     Eonmun  (Hangul: , hanja:    ""vernacular script"") [ 3 ]   Amgeul  ( ""women's script""; also written  Amkeul  ). [ 3 ]   Am  () is a prefix that signifies a noun is feminine   Ahaetgeul  or  Ahaegeul  ( or  ""children's script"")   Achimgeul  ( ""writing you can learn within a morning"") [ 4 ]   Gungmun  (Hangul: , hanja:    ""national script"")     However, these names are now archaic, as the use of hanja in writing has become very rare in South Korea and completely phased out in North Korea.

The Hangul-only column, fourth from left, (  ), has pitch-accent diacritics to the left of the syllable blocks.       Hangul was promulgated by the fourth king of the  Joseon Dynasty ,  Sejong the Great . The  Hall of Worthies  ( Jiphyeonjeon , ) is often credited for the work. [ 5 ]   The project was completed in late December 1443 or January 1444, and described in 1446 in a document titled  Hunmin Jeongeum  (""The Proper Sounds for the Education of the People""), after which the alphabet itself was named. [ 3 ]  The publication date of the  Hunmin Jeong-eum,  October 9, became  Hangul Day  in  South Korea . Its  North Korean  equivalent is on January 15.   Various speculations about the creation process were put to rest by the discovery in 1940 of the 1446  Hunmin Jeong-eum Haerye  ("" Hunmin Jeong-eum  Explanation and Examples""). This document explains the design of the consonant letters according to  articulatory phonetics  and the vowel letters according to the principles of  yin  and  yang  and  vowel harmony .   In explaining the need for the new script, King Sejong explained that the Korean language was different from Chinese; using Chinese characters (known as  hanja ) to write was so difficult for the common people that only privileged aristocrats  ( yangban ),  usually male, could read and write fluently. The majority of Koreans were effectively illiterate before the invention of Hangul.   Hangul was designed so that even a commoner could learn to read and write; the  Haerye  says ""A wise man can acquaint himself with them before the morning is over; a stupid man can learn them in the space of ten days."" [ 6 ]   Hangul faced opposition by the literate elite, such as  Choe Manri  and other  Confucian  scholars in the 1440s, who believed hanja to be the only legitimate writing system, and perhaps saw it as a threat to their status. [ 5 ]  However, it entered popular culture as Sejong had intended, being used especially by women and writers of popular fiction. [ 7 ]  It was effective enough at disseminating information among the uneducated that  Yeonsangun , the paranoid tenth king, forbade the study or use of Hangul and banned Hangul documents in 1504, [ 8 ]  and  King Jungjong  abolished the Ministry of  Eonmun  ( , governmental institution related to Hangul research) in 1506. [ 9 ]   The late 16th century, however, saw a revival of Hangul, with  gasa  literature and later  sijo  flourishing. In the 17th century, Hangul novels became a major genre. [ 10 ]  By this point spelling had become quite irregular. [ 7 ]   Due to growing  Korean nationalism  in the 19th century, Japan's attempt to sever Korea from China's  sphere of influence , and the  Gabo Reformists ' push, Hangul was eventually adopted in official documents for the first time in 1894. [ 8 ]  Elementary school texts began using Hangul in 1895, and the  Dongnip Sinmun , established in 1896, was the first newspaper printed in both Hangul and English. [ 11 ]   After Korea was  annexed by Japan  in 1910, Japanese became the official language and main educational language, but Hangul was also taught in the Japanese-established schools of colonial Korea, and Korean was written in a mixed Hanja-Hangul script, where most lexical roots were written in hanja and grammatical forms in Hangul. The orthography was partially standardized in 1912, with  arae a  restricted to Sino-Korean, the emphatic consonants written   sg,    sd,    sb,    ss,    sj,  and final consonants restricted to   g,    n,    l,    m,    b,    s,    ng,    lg,    lm,    lb  (no   d,  as it was replaced by  s).  Long vowels were marked by a diacritic dot to the left of the syllable, but this was dropped in 1921. [ 7 ]   A second colonial reform occurred in 1930.  Arae a  was abolished; the emphatic consonants were changed to   gg,    dd,    bb,    ss,    jj;  more final consonants () were allowed, making the orthography more  morphophonemic ;   ss  was written alone (without a vowel) when it occurred between nouns; and the  nominative particle    ga  was introduced after vowels, replacing   i.  (  i  had been written without an   iung.  The nominative particle had been unvarying  i  in Sejong's day, and perhaps up to the eighteenth or nineteenth century.) [ 7 ]   Ju Sigyeong , who had coined the term  Hangul  ""great script"" to replace  eonmun  ""vulgar script"" in 1912, established the Hangul Society which further reformed orthography with  Standardized System of Hangul  (  ) in 1933. The principal change was to make Hangul as morphophonemic as practical given the existing letters. [ 7 ]  A system for transliterating foreign orthographies was published in 1940.   However, the Korean language was banned from schools in 1938 as part of a policy of  cultural assimilation , [ 12 ]  and all Korean-language publications were outlawed in 1941. [ 13 ]   The definitive modern orthography was published in 1946, just after independence from Japan. In 1948 North Korea attempted to make the script perfectly morphophonemic through the addition of new letters, and in 1953  Syngman Rhee  in South Korea attempted to simplify the orthography by returning to the colonial orthography of 1921, but both reforms were abandoned after only a few years. [ 7 ]   Since independence from Japan, the Koreas have used Hangul or mixed Hangul as their sole official writing system, with ever-decreasing use of  hanja.  Since the 1950s, it has become uncommon to find  hanja  in commercial or unofficial writing in the South, with some South Korean newspaper only using  hanja  as abbreviations or disambiguation of homonyms. There has been widespread debate as to the future of  hanja  in South Korea. North Korea instated Hangul as its exclusive writing system in 1949, and banned the use of  hanja  completely.     [ edit ]   Jamo   See also:  Hangul consonant and vowel tables     Jamo  (;   ) or  natsori  () are the units that make up the Hangul alphabet.  Ja  means letter or character, and  mo  means mother, so the name suggests that the  jamo  are the building-blocks of the script.   There are 51  jamo,  of which 24 are equivalent to letters of the  Latin alphabet . The other 27  jamo  are clusters of two or sometimes three of these letters. Of the 24 simple  jamo,  fourteen are  consonants   (ja-eum  ,  ""child sounds"") and ten are  vowels   (mo-eum  ,  ""mother sounds""). Five of the simple consonant letters are doubled to form the five ""tense"" ( faucalized ) consonants (see below), while another eleven clusters are formed of two different consonant letters. The ten vowel  jamo  can be combined to form eleven  diphthongs . Here is a summary:     14 simple  consonant  letters: , , , , , , , , , , , , , , plus obsolete , , , , ,  ( alveolar ),  ( velar ), , , , , ,    5 double letters (glottalized): , , , , , plus obsolete , , , , , , , , ,    11  consonant clusters : , , , , , , , , , , , plus obsolete , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and obsolete triple clusters , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,        6 simple  vowel  letters: , , , , , , plus obsolete    4 simple  iotized  vowel letters (semi consonant-semi vowel): , , , , plus obsolete , ,    11  diphthongs : , , , , , , , , , , , plus obsolete , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,      Four of the simple vowel  jamo  are derived by means of a short stroke to signify iotation (a preceding  i  sound):   ya,    yeo,    yo,  and   yu.  These four are counted as part of the 24 simple  jamo  because the iotating stroke taken out of context does not represent  y . In fact, there is no separate  jamo  for  y .   Of the simple consonants,   chieut,    kieuk,    tieut,  and   pieup  are  aspirated  derivatives of   jieut,    giyeok,    digeut,  and   bieup,  respectively, formed by combining the unaspirated letters with an extra stroke.   The doubled letters are   ssang-giyeok  (kk:  ssang-   ""double""),   ssang-digeut  (tt),   ssang-bieup  (pp),   ssang-siot  (ss), and   ssang-jieut  (jj). Double  jamo  do not represent  geminate  consonants, but rather a ""tense""  phonation .     [ edit ]   Stroke order   All hangul letters follow the rules of Chinese calligraphy. Although  and  use a circle, which is not found in printed Chinese characters, it is found in cursive styles.

[ edit ]   Jamo  design   Numerous linguists have praised Hangul for its featural design, describing it as ""remarkable,"" ""the most perfect phonetic system devised,"" and ""brilliant, so deliberately does it fit the language like a glove."" [ 14 ]  The principal reason Hangul has attracted this praise is its partially  featural  design: The shapes of the graphs are related to the phonemes they represent. The shapes of consonant letters are based on the shape of the mouth and tongue in the production of that sound, sometimes with extra marks showing features such as  aspiration . In addition, vowels are built from vertical or horizontal lines so that they are easily distinguishable from consonants.   Scripts may transcribe languages at the level of  morphemes  ( logographic scripts  like  hanja ),  of  syllables  (syllabic scripts like  kana ),  or of  segments  ( alphabetic  scripts like the  Roman alphabet  used to write English and many other languages.). Hangul goes one step further in some cases, using distinct strokes to indicate  distinctive features  such as  place of articulation  ( labial ,  coronal ,  velar , or  glottal ) and  manner of articulation  ( plosive ,  nasal ,  sibilant ,  aspiration ) for consonants, and iotation (a preceding  i-  sound),  harmonic class , and  I-mutation  for vowels.   For instance, the consonant  jamo    t   [t]  is composed of three strokes, each one meaningful: the top stroke indicates  is a plosive, like   ,    g,    d,    j,  which have the same stroke (the last is an  affricate , a plosive-fricative sequence); the middle stroke indicates that  is aspirated, like   h,    k,    ch,  which also have this stroke; and the curved bottom stroke indicates that  is coronal, like   n,    d,  and   l.  (The  element is said to represent the shape of the tongue when pronouncing coronal consonants.) Two consonants,  and , have dual pronunciations, and appear to be composed of two elements corresponding to these two pronunciations:  [] /silence for  and  [m] / [w]  for obsolete .   With vowel  jamo,  a short stroke connected to the main line of the letter indicates that this is one of the vowels which  can  be iotated; this stroke is then doubled when the vowel  is  iotated. The position of the stroke indicates which harmonic class the vowel belongs to,  ""light""  (top or right) or  ""dark""  (bottom or left). In modern  jamo,  an additional vertical stroke indicates  i-mutation , deriving   [] ,   [e] ,   [] , and   [y]  from   [a] ,   [] ,   [o] , and   [u] . However, this is not part of the intentional design of the script, but rather a natural development from what were originally  diphthongs  ending in the vowel   [i] . Indeed, in many  Korean dialects [ citation needed ] , including the standard  dialect of Seoul , some of these may still be diphthongs.   Although the design of the script may be featural, for all practical purposes it behaves as an alphabet. The  jamo   isn't read as three letters  coronal plosive aspirated,  for instance, but as a single consonant  t.  Likewise, the former diphthong  is read as a single vowel  e.   Beside the  jamo,  Hangul originally employed  diacritic marks  to indicate  pitch accent . A syllable with a high pitch () was marked with a dot (  ) to the left of it (when writing vertically); a syllable with a rising pitch () was marked with a double dot, like a colon (  ). These are no longer used. Although  vowel length  was and still is phonemic in Korean, it was never indicated in Hangul, except that syllables with rising pitch (  ) necessarily had long vowels.   Although some aspects of Hangul reflect a shared history with the  Phagspa script , and thus  Indic   phonology , such as the relationships among the  homorganic   jamo  and the  alphabetic principle  itself, other aspects such as organization of  jamo  into syllablic blocks, and which Phagspa letters were chosen to be basic to the system, reflect the influence of Chinese writing and phonology.     [ edit ]   Consonant  jamo  design   The letters for the consonants fall into five  homorganic  groups, each with a basic shape, and one or more letters derived from this shape by means of additional strokes. In the  Hunmin Jeong-eum Haerye  account, the basic shapes iconically represent the articulations the  tongue ,  palate ,  teeth , and  throat  take when making these sounds.       Simple   Aspirated   Tense                                                                       The Korean names for the groups are taken from Chinese  phonetics :     Velar consonants  (,   a-eum  ""molar sounds"")      g   [k] ,   k   [k]   Basic shape:  is a side view of the back of the tongue raised toward the velum (soft palate). (For illustration, access the external link below.)  is derived from  with a stroke for the burst of aspiration.       Coronal consonants  (,   seoreum  ""lingual sounds""):      n   [n] ,   d   [t] ,   t   [t] ,   r   [, l]   Basic shape:  is a side view of the tip of the tongue raised toward the  alveolar ridge  (gum ridge). The letters derived from  are pronounced with the same basic articulation. The line topping  represents firm contact with the roof of the mouth. The middle stroke of  represents the burst of aspiration. The top of  represents a  flap  of the tongue.       Bilabial consonants  (,   suneum  ""labial sounds""):      m   [m] ,   b   [p] ,   p   [p]   Basic shape:  represents the outline of the lips in contact with each other. The top of  represents the release burst of the  b . The top stroke of  is for the burst of aspiration.       Sibilant consonants  (,   chieum  ""dental sounds""):     s  [s] ,  j  [t] ,  ch  [t]   Basic shape:  was originally shaped like a wedge , without the  serif  on top. It represents a side view of the teeth. The line topping  represents firm contact with the roof of the mouth. The stroke topping  represents an additional burst of aspiration.       Glottal consonants  (,   hueum  ""throat sounds""):      ng   [, ] ,   h   [h]   Basic shape:  is an outline of the throat. Originally  was two letters, a simple circle for silence (null consonant), and a circle topped by a vertical line, , for the nasal  ng . A now obsolete letter, , represented a  glottal stop , which is pronounced in the throat and had closure represented by the top line, like . Derived from  is , in which the extra stroke represents a burst of aspiration.         The phonetic theory inherent in the derivation of glottal stop  and aspirate  from the null  may be more accurate than Chinese phonetics or modern  IPA  usage. In Chinese theory and in the IPA, the glottal consonants are posited as having a specific ""glottal"" place of articulation. However, recent phonetic theory has come to view the glottal stop and [h] to be isolated features of 'stop' and 'aspiration' without an inherent place of articulation, just as their Hangul representations based on the null symbol assume.     [ edit ]   Vowel  jamo  design   Vowel letters are based on three elements:     A horizontal line representing the flat Earth, the essence of  yin .   A point for the Sun in the heavens, the essence of  yang . (This becomes a short stroke when written with a brush.)   A vertical line for the upright Human, the neutral mediator between the Heaven and Earth.     Short strokes (dots in the earliest documents) were added to these three basic elements to derive the simple vowel  jamo:     Simple vowels    Horizontal letters: these are mid-high back vowels.    bright   o   dark   u   dark   eu  (  )       Vertical letters: these were once low vowels.    bright   a   dark   eo  (  )   neutral   i           Compound  jamo . Hangul never had a  w , except for  Sino-Korean   etymology . Since an  o  or  u  before an  a  or  eo  became a  [w]  sound, and  [w]  occurred nowhere else,  [w]  could always be analyzed as a  phonemic   o  or  u,  and no letter for  [w]  was needed. However, vowel harmony is observed: ""dark""   u  with ""dark""   eo  for   wo;  ""bright""   a  with ""bright""   o  for   wa:       wa  =   o  +   a     wo  =   u  +   eo     wae  =   o  +   ae     we  =   u  +   e         The compound  jamo  ending in   i  were originally  diphthongs . However, several have since evolved into pure vowels:           ae  =   a  +   i     e  =   eo  +   i     wae  =   wa  +   i     oe  =   o  +   i  (formerly pronounced  [] , see  Korean phonology )     we  =   wo  +   i     wi  =   u  +   i  (formerly pronounced  [y] , see  Korean phonology )     ui  =   eu  +   i           Iotized  vowels: There is no  jamo  for Roman  y  before a vowel. Instead, this sound is indicated by doubling the stroke attached to the base line of the vowel letter. Of the seven basic vowels, four could be preceded by a  y  sound, and these four were written as a dot next to a line. (Through the influence of Chinese calligraphy, the dots soon became connected to the line: .) A preceding  y  sound, called ""iotation"", was indicated by doubling this dot:   yeo, ya, yu, yo . The three vowels which could not be iotated were written with a single stroke:   eu, (arae a), i .         Simple   Iotized                                                                 The simple iotated vowels are,           ya  from    a     yeo  from    eo     yo  from    o     yu  from    u         There are also two iotated diphthongs,           yae  from    ae     ye  from    e         The Korean language of the 15th century had  vowel harmony  to a greater extent than it does today. Vowels in grammatical  morphemes  changed according to their environment, falling into groups which ""harmonized"" with each other. This affected the  morphology  of the language, and Korean phonology described it in terms of  yin  and  yang:  If a root word had  yang  ('bright') vowels, then most suffixes attached to it also had to have  yang  vowels; conversely, if the root had  yin  ('dark') vowels, the suffixes needed to be  yin  as well. There was a third harmonic group called ""mediating"" ('neutral' in Western terminology) that could coexist with either  yin  or  yang  vowels.   The Korean neutral vowel was   i . The  yin  vowels were   eu, u, eo;  the dots are in the  yin  directions of 'down' and 'left'. The  yang  vowels were   , o, a,  with the dots in the  yang  directions of 'up' and 'right'. The  Hunmin Jeong-eum Haerye  states that the shapes of the non-dotted  jamo   were chosen to represent the concepts of  yin,   yang,  and mediation: Earth, Heaven, and Human. (The letter     is now obsolete except in the  Jeju dialect .)   There was yet a third parameter in designing the vowel  jamo,  namely, choosing  as the graphic base of  and , and  as the graphic base of  and . A full understanding of what these horizontal and vertical groups had in common would require knowing the exact sound values these vowels had in the 15 th  century.   Our uncertainty is primarily with the three  jamo  . Some linguists reconstruct these as  *a, *, *e , respectively; others as  *, *e, *a . A third reconstruction is to make them all middle vowels as  *, *, *a . [ 15 ]  With the third reconstruction, Middle Korean vowels actually line up in a tidy vowel harmony pattern, albeit with only one front vowel and four middle vowels:         *i     *     *u         *         *     *o         *a       However, the horizontal  jamo    eu, u, o  do all appear to have been mid to high  back vowels ,  [*, *u, *o] , and thus to have formed a coherent group phonetically in every reconstruction.     [ edit ]   Standard theory of consonant  jamo  design   See also:  Origin of Hangul   The generally accepted theory [ 16 ] on the origin of the  jamo  design is that the vowels are derived from various combinations of the following three components:   . Here,  symbolically stands for the heaven,  stands for the earth, and  stands for a human. The original sequence of the Korean vowels Hunminjeongeum listed these three vowels first, followed by a various combinations. Thus, the original order for the vowels was:           . Note that two positive vowels ( ) including one  are followed by two negative vowels including one , then by two positive vowels each including two of , and then by two negative vowels each including two of . The same theory provides the most simple explanation of the shapes of the consonants as approximation of the shapes of the most representative organ needed to form that sound. The original order of the consonants in Hunmin Jeong-eum was:                 . For example,  representing the ""g"" sound geometrically describes a tongue at the moment of pronunciation.  representing the ""k"" sound is derived from  by adding another stroke.  representing the """" sound geometrically describes an open mouth while the tongue is touching the upper ceiling.  representing the ""d"" sound geometrically describes the combination of the ceiling of the mouth and the tongue.  representing the ""t"" sound is derived from  by adding a stroke.  representing the ""n"" sound geometrically describes a tongue while making the ""n"" sound.  representing the ""b"" sound geometrically describes a closed mouth ready to burst at the moment of pronunciation.  representing the ""p"" sound is a variant of , which is obtained by a 90 degree rotation and extension the horizontal strokes.  representing the ""m"" sound geometrically describes a closed mouth before opening the lips.  representing the ""d"" sound geometrically describes the touching of the ceiling of the mouth with the tongue.  representing the ""ch"" sound is derived from  by adding a stroke.  representing the ""s"" sound geometrically describes a near contact between the tongue and the frontal ceiling of the mouth.  representing a weak ""h"" sound geometrically describes an open throat with a bar to indicate that there is an aspiration.  representing the ""h"" sound is derived from  with the extra stroke representing a stronger flow of the aspiration.  representing the absence of a consonant geometrically describes an open mouth, which necessarily accompanies the following vowel.  representing a sound between ""r"" and ""l"" geometrically describes a backward-bending tongue.  representing a weak ""s"" sound is derived from  by placing an extra stroke. Therefore, according to the standard theory, all alphabets in Hangeul are pure geometric representations of either the shapes of pronunciation organs or abstract symbols. Ledyard's theory below is rejected by the majority of Korean scholars.     [ edit ]   Ledyard's theory of consonant  jamo  design   For more details on this topic, see  origin of Hangul .

(Bottom) Derivation of Phagspa  w, v, f  from variants of the letter  [h]  (left) plus a subscript [w], and analogous composition of Hangul  w, v, f  from variants of the basic letter  [p]  plus a circle.       Although the  Hunmin Jeong-eum Haerye  explains the design of the consonantal  jamo  in terms of  articulatory phonetics , as a purely innovative creation, there are several theories as to which external sources may have inspired or influenced King Sejong's creation. Professor  Gari Ledyard  of Columbia University believes that five consonant letters were derived from the Mongol  Phagspa alphabet  of the  Yuan dynasty . A sixth basic letter, the null initial , was invented by Sejong. The rest of the  jamo  were derived internally from these six, essentially as described in the  Hunmin Jeong-eum Haerye . However, the five borrowed consonants were not the graphically simplest letters considered basic by the  Hunmin Jeong-eum Haerye,  but instead the consonants basic to Chinese phonology: , , , , and .   The  Hunmin Jeong-eum  states that King Sejong adapted the  ("" G  Seal Script"") in creating Hangul. The  has never been identified. The primary meaning of   g  is ""old"" (""Old Seal Script""), frustrating philologists because Hangul bears no functional similarity to Chinese   seal scripts . However, Ledyard believes   g  may be a pun on   Mngg  ""Mongol"", and that  is an abbreviation of  ""Mongol Seal Script"", that is, the formal variant of the Phagspa alphabet written to look like the Chinese seal script. There were Phagspa manuscripts in the Korean palace library, including some in the seal-script form, and several of Sejong's ministers knew the script well.   If this was the case, Sejong's evasion on the Mongol connection can be understood in light of Korea's relationship with Ming China after the fall of the Mongol Yuan dynasty, and of the literati's contempt for the Mongols as ""barbarians"".   According to Ledyard, the five borrowed letters were graphically simplified, which allowed for  jamo  clusters and left room to add a stroke to derive the aspirate plosives, . But in contrast to the traditional account, the non-plosives ( ng   and ) were derived by  removing  the top of the basic letters. He points out that while it's easy to derive  from  by removing the top, it's not clear how to derive  from  in the traditional account, since the shape of  is not analogous to those of the other plosives.   The explanation of the letter  ng  also differs from the traditional account. Many Chinese words began with  ng,  but by King Sejong's day, initial  ng  was either silent or pronounced  []  in China, and was silent when these words were borrowed into Korean. Also, the expected shape of  ng  (the short vertical line left by removing the top stroke of ) would have looked almost identical to the vowel   [i] . Sejong's solution solved both problems: The vertical stroke left from  was added to the null symbol  to create  (a circle with a vertical line on top), iconically capturing both the pronunciation  []  in the middle or end of a word, and the usual silence at the beginning. (The graphic distinction between null  and   []  was eventually lost.)   Another letter composed of two elements to represent two regional pronunciations was , which transcribed the Chinese  initial  . This represented either  m  or  w  in various Chinese dialects, and was composed of  [m] plus  (from Phagspa [w]). In Phagspa, a loop under a letter represented  w  after vowels, and Ledyard proposes this became the loop at the bottom of . Now, in Phagspa the Chinese initial  is also transcribed as a compound with  w,  but in its case the  w  is placed under an  h.  Actually, the Chinese consonant series   w, v, f  is transcribed in Phagspa by the addition of a  w  under three graphic variants of the letter for  h,  and Hangul parallels this convention by adding the  w  loop to the labial series   m, b, p,  producing now-obsolete   w, v, f.  (Phonetic values in Korean are uncertain, as these consonants were only used to transcribe Chinese.)   As a final piece of evidence, Ledyard notes that most of the borrowed Hangul letters were simple geometric shapes, at least originally, but that   d  [t] always had a small lip protruding from the upper left corner, just as the Phagspa  d  [t] did. This lip can be traced back to the Tibetan letter  d , .   If Ledyard's theory is correct, Hangul would be part of the great family of alphabets ultimately developing out of the Middle Eastern  Phoenician alphabet , along the route Phoenician >  Aramaic  >  Brhm  >  Tibetan  > Phagspa > Hangul.     [ edit ]   Jamo  order   The alphabetical order of Hangul does not mix consonants and vowels as Western alphabets do. Rather, the order is that of the  Indic type , first velar consonants, then coronals, labials, sibilants,  etc.  However, the vowels come after the consonants rather than before them as in the Indic systems.     [ edit ]   Historical orders   The consonantal order of the  Hunmin Jeongeum  in 1446 was,                          and the order of vowels was,                    In 1527,  Choe Sejin  reorganized the alphabet:                                          This is the basis of the modern alphabetic orders. It was before the development of the Korean tense consonants and the double  jamo  that represent them, and before the conflation of the letters  (null) and  (ng). Thus when the  South Korean  and  North Korean  governments implemented full use of Hangul, they ordered these letters differently, with South Korea grouping similar letters together, and North Korea placing new letters at the end of the alphabet.     [ edit ]   South Korean order   In the Southern order, double  jamo  are placed immediately after their single counterparts. No distinction is made between silent and nasal :                                                   The modern  monophthongal  vowels come first, with the derived forms interspersed according to their form: first added  i , then iotized, then iotized with added  i .  Diphthongs  beginning with  w  are ordered according to their spelling, as  or  plus a second vowel, not as separate  digraphs .   The order of the final  jamo  is,     (none)                                ""None"" stands for no final jamo.     [ edit ]   North Korean order   North Korea maintains a more traditional order:                             used as an initial, goes at the very end, as it is a placeholder for the vowels which follow. (A syllable with no final is ordered before all syllables with finals, however, not with null .)   The new letters, the double  jamo , are placed at the end of the consonants, just before the null , so as not to alter the traditional order of the rest of the alphabet.   The order of the vocalic  jamo  is,                              All digraphs and  trigraphs , including the old diphthongs  and , are placed after all basic vowels, again maintaining Choe's alphabetic order.   The order of the final  jamo  is,     (none)                                Unlike the order of the initial  jamo , on the other hand, this  is the nasal   ng,  which occurs only as a final in the modern language. The double  jamo  are placed to the very end, like the initial  jamo  order, but the combined consonants are placed right after their first counterparts.     [ edit ]   Jamo  names   The Hangul arrangement is called the  ganada  order, ( ) which is basically an alphabetical order named after the first three  jamo   (g, n, d)  affixed to the first vowel  (a).  The  jamo  were named by Choe Sejin in 1527. North Korea regularized the names when it made Hangul its official orthography.     [ edit ]   Consonantal  jamo  names   The modern consonants have two-syllable names, with the consonant coming both at the beginning and end of the name, as follows:       Consonant   Name          giyeok  (), or  kik  () in North Korea          nieun/nin  ()          digeut  (), or  tit  () in North Korea          rieul/ril  ()          mieum/mim  ()          bieup/pip  ()          siot  (), or  sit  () in North Korea          ieung/ing  ()          jieut/chit  ()          chieut/ch'it  ()          kieuk/k'ik  ()          tieut/t'it  ()          pieup/p'ip  ()          hieut/hit  ()               All  jamo  in North Korea, and all but three in the more traditional nomenclature used in South Korea, have names of the format of  letter  +  i  +  eu  +  letter . For example, Choe wrote  bieup  with the  hanja    bi    eup . The names of  g,   d,  and  s  are exceptions because there were no  hanja  for  euk,   eut,  and  eus .   yeok  is used in place of  euk . Since there is no  hanja  that ends in  t  or  s,  Choi chose two  hanja  to be read in their Korean gloss,   kkeut  ""end"" and   ot  ""clothes"".   Originally, Choi gave  j, ch, k, t, p,  and  h  the irregular one-syllable names of  ji, chi, ki, ti, pi,  and  hi,  because they should not be used as final consonants, as specified in  Hunmin jeong-eum . But after the establishment of the new orthography in 1933, which allowed all consonsants to be used as finals, the names were changed to the present forms.

These include several that represent Korean sounds that have since disappeared from the standard language, as well as a larger number used to represent the sounds of the Chinese  rime tables . The most frequently encountered of these archaic letters are:     (transcribed    ( arae-a   ""lower  a"" ): Presumably pronounced  [] , similar to modern  eo . It is written as a dot, positioned beneath (Korean for ""beneath"" is  arae ) the consonant. The  arae-a  is not entirely obsolete, as it can been found in various brand names and is often used in  spelling the dialect of Jeju Island , Korea's southernmost province, where it is pronounced  [] . Even so, it was not transcribed in the official  Korean Romanization  and thus modern renderings of the Jeju dialect transcribe it the same way as , that is,  o . Korean words that were written with  long ago are now usually written with  pronounced  [a] .    The    formed a medial of its own, or was found in the diphthong   arae-ae , written with the dot under the consonant and  (transcribed  i ) to its right  in the same fashion as  or .         z  ( bansiot  ): A rather unusual sound, perhaps IPA  []  (a  nasalized   palatal fricative ). Modern Korean words previously spelled with  substitute .       ( yeorinhieut   ""light hieut"" or  doenieung    ""strong ieung""): A  glottal stop , ""lighter than  and harsher than "".       ( yesieung  ): The original  jamo  for  [] ; now conflated with   ieung . (With some computer  fonts  such as  Arial Unicode MS ,  yesieung  is shown as a flattened version of  ieung,  but the correct form is with a long peak, longer than what you would see on a  serif  version of  ieung.)       ( gabyeounbieup  ): IPA  [f] . This letter appears to be a digraph of  bieup  and  ieung,  but it may be more complicated than that. There were three other less common  jamo  for sounds in this section of the Chinese  rime tables ,   w  ( [w]  or  [m] ), a theoretical   f,  and   ff   [v] ; the bottom element appears to be only coincidentally similar to  ieung.     There were two other now-obsolete double  jamo ,       x  ( ssanghieut   ""double  hieut""):  IPA  []  or  [] .    ( ssang-ieung   ""double  ieung""):  Another  jamo  used in the Chinese rime table.     In the original Hangul system, double  jamo  were used to represent Chinese  voiced  () consonants, which survive in the  Shanghainese   slack  consonants, and were not used for Korean words. It was only later that a similar convention was used to represent the modern ""tense"" ( faucalized ) consonants of Korean.   The sibilant (""dental"") consonants were modified to represent the two series of Chinese sibilants,  alveolar  and  retroflex , a ""round"" vs. ""sharp"" distinction which was never made in Korean, and which was even being lost from southern Chinese. The alveolar  jamo  had longer left stems, while retroflexes had longer right stems:       Original consonants                      Chidueum  (alveolar sibilant)                      Jeongchieum  (retroflex sibilant)                      There were also  consonant clusters  that have since dropped out of the language, such as the initials   bsg  and   bsd,  as well as  diphthongs  that were used to represent Chinese medials, such as , , , .   Some of the Korean sounds represented by these obsolete jamo still exist in some dialects.

In order to make Hangul a perfect  morphophonological  fit to the Korean language, North Korea introduced six new  jamo,  which were published in the  New Orthography for the Korean Language  and used officially from 1948-1954.   Two obsolete  jamo  were resurrected: <> (), which alternated in pronunciation between initial /l/ and final /d/; and <> (), which was only pronounced between vowels. Two modifications of the letter  were introduced, one for a  which is silent finally, and one for a  which doubles between vowels. A hybrid - letter was introduced for words which alternate between those two sounds (that is, a /b/ which becomes /w/ before a vowel). Finally, a vowel <1> was introduced for variable  iotation .     [ edit ]   Morpho-Syllabic blocks   Except for a few grammatical morphemes prior to the twentieth century, no letter may stand alone to represent elements of the Korean language. Instead,  jamo  are grouped into  syllabic  or  morphemic  blocks of at least two and often three: (1) a consonant or a doubled consonant called the  initial  (,     choseong   syllable onset ), (2) a vowel or  diphthong  called the  medial  (,     jungseong   syllable nucleus ), and, optionally, (3) a consonant or consonant cluster at the end of the syllable, called the  final  (,     jongseong   syllable coda ). When a syllable has no actual initial consonant, the  null initial    ieung  is used as a placeholder. (In modern Hangul, placeholders are not used for the final position.) Thus, a block contains a minimum of two  jamo,  an initial and a medial. Although the Hangul has historically been organized into syllables, in modern orthography it is instead first organized into morphemes, and only secondarily into syllables within those morphemes, with the exception that single-consonant morphemes may not be written alone. (See  Orthography .)   The sets of initial and final consonants are not the same. For instance,   ng  only occurs in final position, while the doubled  jamo  that can occur in final position are limited to   ss  and   kk . For a list of initials, medials, and finals, see  Hangul consonant and vowel tables .   Not including obsolete  jamo,  there are 11 172 possible Hangul blocks.     [ edit ]   Jamo placement within a block   The placement or ""stacking"" of  jamo  in the block follows set patterns based on the shape of the medial.     The components of complex  jamo,  such as   bs,    wo,  or obsolete   bsd,    ye  are written left to right.   Medials are written under the initial, to the right, or wrap around the initial from bottom to right, depending on their shape: If the medial has a horizontal axis like   eu,  then it is written under the initial; if it has a vertical axis like   i,  then it is written to the right of the initial; and if it combines both orientations, like   ui,  then it wraps around the initial from the bottom to the right:               initial   medial               initial       medial               initial   med.  2       med. 1               A final  jamo,  if there is one, is always written at the bottom, under the medial. This is called   batchim  ""supporting floor"":               initial   medial       final               initial       medial       final               initial   med.  2       med.       final               A complex final is written left to right:               initial   medial       final 1   final 2               initial       medial       final 1   final 2               initial   med.  2       med.       fin. 1   fin. 2             Blocks are always written in phonetic order, initial-medial-final. Therefore,     Syllables with a horizontal medial are written downward:   eup ;   Syllables with a vertical medial and simple final are written clockwise:   ssang ;   Syllables with a wrapping medial switch direction (down-right-down):   doen ;   Syllables with a complex final are written left to right at the bottom:   balp .       [ edit ]   Block shape   Normally the resulting block is written within a square of the same size and shape as a  hanja  (Chinese character) by compressing or stretching the jamo to fill the bounds of the block; therefore someone not familiar with the scripts may mistake Hangul text for Hanja or Chinese text.   However, some recent fonts (for example  Eun, HYM, UnJamo ) move towards the Western practice of letters whose relative size is fixed, and the use of whitespace to fill letter positions not used in a particular block, and away from the East Asian tradition of square block characters (). They break one or more of the traditional rules:     Do not stretch initial consonant vertically, but leave  white space  below it if no lower vowel and/or no final consonant.   Do not stretch right-hand vowel vertically, but leave white space below it if no final consonant. (Often the right-hand vowel extends farther down than the left-hand consonant, like a  descender  in Western typography)   Do not stretch final consonant horizontally, but leave white space to left of it.   Do not stretch or pad each block to be a  fixed width , but allow variable width ( kerning ) where syllable blocks with no right-hand vowel and no double final consonant can be narrower than blocks that do have a right-hand vowel or double final consonant.     So far, these fonts have been used as design accents on signs or headings, rather than for typesetting large volumes of body text.     [ edit ]   Linear Hangul   There was a minor and unsuccessful movement in the early twentieth century to abolish syllabic blocks and write the  jamo  individually and in a row, in the fashion of the Western alphabets: e.g.  for   hangeul.   [ 17 ]   Avant-garde typographer Ahn Sang-Soo made a font for the ""Hangul Dada"" exposition that exploded the syllable blocks; but while it strings out the jamo horizontally, it retains the distinctive vertical position each letter would normally have within a block, unlike the century-old linear writing proposals. [ 18 ]   While Koreans have largely accepted the Western-derived conventions of writing successive syllables left-to-right in horizontal lines instead of in vertical columns, adding spaces between words, and Western-style punctuation, they have completely resisted getting rid of syllabic blocks, the most distinctive feature of this writing system.     [ edit ]   Orthography   Until the 20th century, no official orthography of Hangul had been established. Due to liaison, heavy consonant assimilation, dialectical variants and other reasons, a Korean word can potentially be spelled in various ways. King Sejong seemed to prefer  morphophonemic  spelling (representing the underlying root forms) rather than a  phonemic  one (representing the actual sounds). However, early in its history, Hangul was dominated by phonemic spelling. Over the centuries the orthography became partially morphophonemic, first in nouns, and later in verbs. Today it is as morphophonemic as is practical. The difference between phonetic Romanization, phonemic orthography, and morpho-phonemic orthography can be illustrated with the phrase  motaneun sarami :     Phonetic transcription and translation:       motaneun sarami   [mo.ta.nn.sa.a.mi]   a person who cannot do it       Phonemic transcription:          /mo.ta.nn.sa.la.mi/       Morphophonemic transcription:          |mos-ha-nn-sa.lam-i|       Morpheme-by-morpheme  gloss :                    =            mos-ha-neun   saram=i            cannot-do-[ attributive ]   person=[subject]         Modern orthography:             After the  Gabo Reform  in 1894, the  Joseon Dynasty  and later the  Korean Empire  started to write all official documents in Hangul. Under the government's management, proper usage of Hangul, including orthography, was discussed, until Korea was  annexed  by Japan in 1910.   The Japanese  Government-General of Chosen  established the writing style of a mixture of hanja and Hangul, as in the Japanese writing system. The government revised the spelling rules in 1912, 1921 and 1930, which were relatively phonemic.   The  Hangul Society , originally founded by  Ju Si-gyeong , announced a proposal for a new, strongly morphophonemic orthography in 1933, which became the prototype of the contemporary orthographies in both North and South Korea. After Korea was divided, the North and South revised orthographies separately. The guiding text for  Hangul orthography  is called  Hangeul Machumbeop,  whose last South Korean revision was published in 1988 by the Ministry of Education.     [ edit ]   Mixed scripts   Since the Late Joseon dynasty period, various  Hanja-Hangul mixed systems  were used. In these systems, hanja was used for lexical roots, and Hangul for grammatical words and inflections, much as  kanji  and  kana  are used in Japanese. Today however,  hanja  have been almost entirely phased out of daily use in North Korea, and in South Korea they are now mostly restricted to parenthetical glosses for proper names and for disambiguating homonyms.   Arabic numerals can also be mixed in with Hangul, as in 2007 3 22 ( 22 March   2007 ).   The Roman alphabet, and occasionally other alphabets, may be sprinkled within Korean texts for illustrative purposes, or for unassimilated  loanwords .     [ edit ]   Readability   The organization of Hangul syllableswith individual phonemes clustered into a syllable, rather than organized in a horizontal line as in Englishis thought by some observers to be a powerful reading aid. Because of the clustering of syllables, words are shorter on the page than their linear counterparts would be, and the boundaries between syllables are easily visible (which may aid reading, if segmenting words into syllables is natural for the reader than dividing them up into phonemes). [ 19 ]  Because the component parts of the syllable are relatively simple phonemic characters, the number of strokes per character on average is lower than in Chinese characters. [ citation needed ]  Unlike syllabaries, such as Japanese kana, or Chinese logographs, none of which encode the constituent phonemes within a syllable, the graphic complexity of Korean syllabic blocks varies in direct proportion with the phonemic complexity of the syllable. [ 20 ]  Unlike linear alphabets such as English, the Korean orthography allows the reader to ""utilize both the horizontal and vertical visual fields;"" [ 21 ]  finally, since Hangul syllables are represented both as collections of phonemes and as unique-looking graphs, they may allow for both visual and aural retrieval of words from the  lexicon .   Although many experts hold similar views about the advantages of Hangul for readability and literacy, [ citation needed ]  most of these theories have not yet been subject to rigorous testing, or the tests have not shown the specific features of the Hangul orthography to produce any significant effects on readers' visual processing. [ 22 ]     [ edit ]   Style   Hangul may be written either vertically or horizontally. The traditional direction is the Chinese style of writing top to bottom, right to left. Horizontal writing in the style of the Roman alphabet was promoted by  Ju Sigyeong , and has become overwhelmingly preferred.   In  Hunmin Jeongeum , Hangul was printed in sans-serif angular lines of even thickness. This style is found in books published before about 1900, and can be found today in stone carvings (on statues, for example).          Three Korean type styles (gungche, batang, dotum) next to analogous Latin type styles       Over the centuries, an ink-brush style of  calligraphy  developed, employing the same style of lines and angles as Chinese calligraphy. This brush style is called  gungche  ( ), which means ""Palace Style"" because the style was mostly developed and used by the maidservants ( gungnyeo,   ) of the court in Joseon dynasty.   Modern styles that are more suited for printed media were developed in the 20th century, which were more or less influenced by Japanese typefaces, the serifed  Myeongjo  (derived from Japanese  minch ) and  sans-serif   Gothic  (from Japanese  Gothic ) being the foremost examples. Variations of these styles are widely used today in books, newspapers, and magazines, and several computer  fonts . In 1993, new names for both Myeongjo and Gothic styles were introduced when Ministry of Culture initiated an effort to standardize typographic terms, and the names  Batang  (, meaning ""background"") and  Dotum  (, meaning ""stand out"") replaced Myeongjo and Gothic respectively. These names are also used in  Microsoft Windows .   A sans-serif style with lines of equal width is popular with pencil and pen writing, and is often the default typeface of Web browsers. A minor advantage of this style is that it makes it easier to distinguish  -eung  from  -ung  even in small or untidy print, as the  jongseong ieung  () of such fonts usually lacks a  serif  that could be mistaken for the   (u) jamo 's short vertical line.

Korean  (  /  , see  below ) is the official  language  of  North Korea  and  South Korea . It is also one of the two official languages in the  Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture  in  China . There are about 78 million Korean speakers. It was formerly written using  Hanja , borrowed  Chinese characters  pronounced in the Korean way. In the 15th century a national writing system was developed by  Sejong the Great , nowadays called  Hangul .   The genealogical  classification  of the Korean language is debated. Some linguists place it in the  Altaic  language family, while others consider it to be a  language isolate . It is  agglutinative  in its morphology and  SOV  in its  syntax .

In South Korea, the language is most often called  Hangungmal  (  ;   ), or more formally,  Hangugeo  (  ;   ) or  Gugeo  (  ;   ; literally ""national language"").   In North Korea and Yanbian in China, the language is most often called  Chosnmal  (  ; with  hanja :   ), or more formally,  Chosn  (  ;   ).   On the other hand, Korean people in the  former USSR , who refer to themselves as  Koryo-saram  (also  Goryeoin  [  ;   ; literally, "" Goryeo  person(s)""]) call the language  Goryeomal  (  ;   ).   In  mainland China , following the establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992, the term  Choxiny  (   or short form:  Choy  (  )) has normally been used to refer to the language spoken in North Korea and Yanbian, while  Hnguy  (   or short form:  Hny  (  )) is used to refer to the language spoken in South Korea.   Some older English sources also used the name ""Korean"" to refer to the language, country, and people.     [ edit ]   History       Main article:  History of the Korean language       Korean is descended from  Old Korean  and  Middle Korean .     [ edit ]   Classification   The classification of the modern Korean language is uncertain, and due to the lack of any one generally accepted theory, it is sometimes described conservatively as a  language isolate .   On the other hand, since the publication of the article of  Ramstedt  in 1926, many linguists support the hypothesis that Korean can be classified as an  Altaic  language, or as a relative of proto-Altaic. Korean is similar to Altaic languages in that they both lack certain grammatical elements, including  number ,  gender ,  articles , fusional morphology, voice, and  relative pronouns  (Kim Namkil). Korean especially bears some  morphological  resemblance to some languages of the Northern Turkic group, namely  Sakha (Yakut) . Vinokurova, a scholar of the Sakha language, noted that like in Korean, and unlike in other  Turkic languages  or a variety of other languages surveyed, adverbs in Sakha are derived from verbs with the help of derivational morphology; however, she did not suggest this implied any relation between the two languages. [ 2 ]   It is also considered likely that Korean is related in some way to  Japanese , since the two languages have nearly identical grammatical structures, and share a number of possible phonological cognates (though a majority of them are likely due to local pronunciations of the Chinese characters from which they are derived), as noted by such researchers as  Samuel E. Martin  and  Roy Andrew Miller  in the late 1960s.  Sergei Starostin  (1991) found about 25% of potential cognates in the Japanese-Korean 100-word  Swadesh list , which places these two languages closer together than other possible members of the Altaic family. [ 3 ]   Genetic relationships have been postulated both directly and indirectly, the latter either through placing both languages in the Altaic family, or by arguing for a relationship between Japanese and the  Buyeo languages  of  Goguryeo  and  Baekje  (see below); the proposed Baekje relationship is supported by cognates such as Baekje  mir , Japanese  mi-  ""three"". [ 4 ]   The possible relationship between Korean and Japanese can be exemplified by such basic vocabularly items as J.     mizu  (Old J.  midu ) : K.     mul  (Middle K.  mirh ) ""water"",  mot  ""lake""; J.     ku-ru  ""come"" (Old J.  ku , also cf. irregular root changes as in past tense   ki-ta , negative   ko-nai  in Modern J.) : K.     ka-da  (""go""); J.     kata-i  ""hard"" (whence     kata-na  ""knife, sword"") : K.  kud-yn  (hard); J.     i-ru  ""to be"" (past tense   i-ta ) : K.     i-da  ""to be""; J.  na ,  -en  : K.  anh  ""not"", J.  minna  (Old J.  mynna ) ""all, everyone"" : K.  manh-  ""many"" (predicate  mana-da ), etc.  [ 5 ] . The same possible cognates are often observed in other members of the potential  Altaic family , esp. in the  Tungusic languages . Cf. Nanay  mue  ""water"",  giagda-  ""to walk"",  anaa, anna  ""not"".   Others argue, however, that the similarities are not due to any genetic relationship, but rather to a  sprachbund  effect. See  East Asian languages  for morphological features shared among languages of the East Asian  sprachbund , and  Japanese language classification  for further details on the possible relationship.   It is presumed that modern Korean may be more closely related to the languages of  Samhan  and  Silla  than the Buyeo languages; many Korean scholars believe they were mutually intelligible, and the collective basis of what in the  Goryeo  period would merge to become Middle Korean (the language before the changes that the  Seven-Year War  brought) and eventually Modern Korean. The  Jeju dialect  preserves some archaic features that can also be found in Middle Korean, whose  arae a  is retained in the dialect as a distinct vowel.   There are also more marginal hypotheses proposing various other relationships; for example, a few scholars, such as  Homer B. Hulbert  (1905), have tried to relate Korean to the  Dravidian languages  through the similar syntax in both. [ 6 ]   Though not related to Chinese, it has borrowed heavily; see the Vocabulary section below.     [ edit ]   Dialects       Main article:  Korean dialects              Dialects of Korean       Korean has several  dialects  (called  mal  [literally ""speech""],  saturi , or  bang-eon  in Korean). The  standard language  ( pyojuneo  or  pyojunmal ) of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  P'yngyang . These dialects are similar, and are in fact all mutually intelligible, perhaps with the exception of the dialect of  Jeju Island  (see  Jeju dialect ). The dialect spoken in Jeju is in fact classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of  Seoul dialect  use very little stress, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of the  Gyeongsang dialect  have a very pronounced intonation.   It is also worth noting that there is substantial evidence for a history of extensive  dialect levelling , or even  convergent evolution  or intermixture of two or more originally distinct linguistic stocks, within the Korean language and its dialects. Many Korean dialects have basic vocabulary that is etymologically distinct from vocabulary of identical meaning in Standard Korean or other dialects, such as South Jeolla dialect /kur/ vs. Standard Korean     /ip/  ""mouth"" or Gyeongsang dialect  /.u.i/  vs. Standard Korean  /puu/  "" garlic chives ."" This suggests that the Korean Peninsula may have at one time been much more linguistically diverse than it is at present. [ citation needed ]  See also the  Buyeo languages   hypothesis .   There is a very close connection between the dialects of Korean and the  regions of Korea , since the boundaries of both are largely determined by mountains and seas. Here is a list of traditional dialect names and locations:       Standard dialect   Where used       Seoul   Seoul  (),  Incheon  (/), most of  Gyeonggi  (/)       P'yngan  (/)   P'yngyang ,  P'yngan  region,  Chagang  (North Korea)       Regional dialect   Where used       Gyeonggi   limited areas of the  Gyeonggi  region (South Korea)       Chungcheong   Daejeon ,  Chungcheong  region (South Korea)       Gangwon   Gangwon-do (South Korea) / Kangwn (North Korea)       Gyeongsang   Busan ,  Daegu ,  Ulsan ,  Gyeongsang  region (South Korea)       Hamgyng   Rasn ,  Hamgyng  region,  Ryanggang  (North Korea)       Hwanghae   Hwanghae  region (North Korea)       Jeju   Jeju Island/Province  (South Korea)       Jeolla   Gwangju ,  Jeolla  region (South Korea)         [ edit ]   Phonology       This article contains  IPA  phonetic symbols.

Main article:  Korean phonology         [ edit ]   Consonants          The Korean consonants             Bilabial   Alveolar   Post-  alveolar   Velar   Glottal       Nasal      /m/      /n/        //  (syllable-final)         Plosive  and   Affricate   plain      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         tense      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         aspirated      /p/      /t/      //      /k/         Fricative   plain        /s/          /h/       tense        /s/             Liquid        /l/           The  IPA  symbol <  > (a subscript double straight quotation mark, shown here with a placeholder circle) is used to denote the tensed consonants  /p/, /t/, /k/, //, /s/ . Its official use in the  Extensions to the IPA  is for  'strong'  articulation, but is used in the literature for  faucalized voice . The Korean consonants also have elements of  stiff voice , but it is not yet known how typical this is of faucalized consonants. They are produced with a partially constricted  glottis  and additional subglottal pressure in addition to tense vocal tract walls, laryngeal lowering, or other expansion of the larynx.     [ edit ]   Vowels                    The Korean basic vowels                 Monophthongs   /i/    ,  /e/    ,  //    ,  /a/    ,  /o/    ,  /u/    ,  //    ,  //    ,  //          Vowels preceded by intermediaries,  or Diphthongs   /je/    ,  /j/    ,  /ja/    ,  /wi/    ,  /we/    ,  /w/    ,  /wa/    ,  /i/    ,  /jo/    ,  /ju/    ,  /j/    ,  /w/            [ edit ]   Allophones   /s/  becomes an  alveolo-palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i]  for most speakers (but see  Differences in the language between North Korea and South Korea ). This occurs with the tense fricative and all the affricates as well. At the end of a syllable, /s/ changes to /t/ (Example: beoseot () 'mushroom').   /h/  may become a  bilabial   []  before  [o]  or  [u] , a  palatal   []  before  [j]  or  [i] , a  velar   [x]  before  [] , a voiced  []  between voiced sounds, and a  [h]  elsewhere. [ citation needed ]   /p, t, , k/  become voiced  [b, d, , ]  between voiced sounds.   /l/  becomes alveolar flap  []  between vowels, and  [l]  or  []  at the end of a syllable or next to another  /l/ . Note that a written syllable-final '', when followed by a vowel or a glide ( i.e. , when the next character starts with ''), migrates to the next syllable and thus becomes  [] .   Traditionally,  /l/  was disallowed at the beginning of a word. It disappeared before  [j] , and otherwise became  /n/ . However, the inflow of western loanword changed the trend, and now word-initial  /l/  (mostly from English loanwords) are pronounced as a free variation of either  []  or  [l] . The traditional prohibition of word-initial  /l/  became a morphological rule called ""initial law"" () in South Korea, which pertains to Sino-Korean vocabulary. Such words retain their word-initial  /l/  in North Korea.   All  obstruents  (plosives, affricates, fricatives) are  unreleased   [p, t, k]  at the end of a word.   Plosive stops  /p, t, k/  become nasal stops  [m, n, ]  before nasal stops.   Hangul  spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying, partly historical  morphology . Given this, it is sometimes hard to tell which actual phonemes are present in a certain word.   One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial  [r] , and initial  [n] . For example,     ""labour"" - north:  r odong  (), south:  n odong  ()   ""history"" - north:  ry ksa  (), south:  y eoksa  ()   ""female"" - north:  ny ja  (), south:  y eoja  ()       [ edit ]   Morphophonemics   Grammatical morphemes may change shape depending on the preceding sounds. Examples include  -eun/-neun  (-/-) and  -i/-ga  (-/-). Sometimes sounds may be inserted instead. Examples include  -eul/-reul  (-/-),  -euro/-ro  (-/-),  -eseo/-seo  (-/-),  -ideunji/-deunji  (-/-) and  -iya/-ya  (-/-). However,  -euro/-ro  is somewhat irregular, since it will behave differently after a rieul consonant.     Korean particles     After a consonant   After a rieul   After a vowel       -ui  (-)       -eun  (-)   -neun  (-)       -i  (-)   -ga  (-)       -eul  (-)   -reul  (-)       -gwa  (-)   -wa  (-)       -euro  (-)   -ro  (-)       Some verbs may also change shape morphophonemically.     [ edit ]   Grammar       Main article:  Korean grammar         [ edit ]   Sentence structure   Korean is an  agglutinative language . Modifiers generally follow the modified word, and in the case of verb modifiers, can be serially appended. The basic form of a Korean sentence is  Subject Object Verb , but the verb is the only required and immovable element.       A :       -       -? (?)           gage-e     gasseo-yo           store + [location marker ()]     [go (verb root) ()]+[conjunctive ()]+[past ()]+[conjunctive ()]+ [interrogative marker ()]         ""Did [you] go to the store?"" (with ""you"" implied by context)         B :       .           ne           yes         ""Yes.""       [ edit ]   Parts of speech     [ edit ]   Verb   Korean  verbs  (  ,  dongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""action verbs"" or ""dynamic verbs"" to distinguish them from [  () ,  hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""]), which are also known as ""descriptive verbs"" or ""stative verbs"". Examples of action/dynamic verbs include    ( hada , ""to do, to have"") and    ( gada , ""to go"") which constitute an action or movement as opposed to descriptive verbs such as    ( yehppeuda , ""to be beautiful""). For a larger list of Korean verbs, see  wikt:Category:Korean verbs .   Unlike most of the European languages, Korean does not conjugate verbs using agreement with the subject, and nouns have no gender. Instead, verb conjugations depend upon the verb tense, aspect, mood, and the social relation between the speaker, the subjects, and the listeners. The system of speech levels and honorifics loosely resembles the  T-V distinction  of most  Indo-European languages . For example, different endings are used based on whether the subjects and listeners are friends, parents, or honoured persons.     [ edit ]   Adjective   Words categorized as Korean  adjectives  (  ,  hyeong-yongsa ,   ) conjugate similarly to verbs, so some English texts call them ""descriptive verbs"" or "" stative verbs "", but they are distinctly separate from    ( dongsa ).   English does not have an identical grammatical category, so the English translation of Korean adjectives may misleadingly suggest that they are verbs. For example,    ( bukda ) translates literally as ""to be red"" and    ( aswipda ) often best translates as ""to lack"" or ""to want for"", but both are    ( hyeong-yongsa , ""adjectives""). For a larger list of Korean adjectives, see  wikt:Category:Korean adjectives .     [ edit ]   Determiner   Korean  determiners  (  ,  gwanhyeongsa ,   ) are also known in English as ""determinatives"", ""adnominals"", ""pre-nouns"", ""attributives"", and ""unconjugated adjectives"". Examples include    ( gak , ""each""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean determiners .     [ edit ]   Noun   A large body of Korean  nouns  (  ,  myeongsa ,   ) stem from  Chinese characters , e.g.    (,  san , mountain),    (,  yeok , station),    (,  munhwa , culture), etc. Others are native to the Korean language, e.g.    ( nara , country),    ( nal , day). Many  Sino-Korean words  have a native Korean equivalent and vice versa, but not always. Nouns do not have  grammatical gender  and can be made  plural  by adding  to the end of the word, however in most instances the  singular  form is used even when in English it would be translated as plural. For example, while in English the sentence  ""there are three apples""  would use the plural  ""apples""  instead of the singular  ""apple"" , the Korean sentence    ( sagwa segae isssumnida ) maintains the word  ( sagwa , ""apple"") in its singular form, thus rendered in English as ""apple three(things) exist."" For a list of Korean nouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean nouns .     [ edit ]   Pronoun       Main article:  Korean pronouns       Korean  pronouns  (  ,  daemyeongsa ,   ) are highly influenced by the honorifics in the language. Pronouns change forms depending on the social status of the person or persons spoken to, e.g. the pronoun for ""I"" there is both the informal    ( na ) and the honorific/humble    ( jeo ). In general second person singular pronouns are avoided, especially when using honorific forms. For a larger list or Korean pronouns, see  wikt:Category:Korean pronouns .     [ edit ]   Adverb   Korean  adverbs  (  ,  busa ,   ) include    ( tto , ""also"") and    ( gadeuk , ""fully""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean adverbs .     [ edit ]   Particle   Korean  particles  (  ,  josa ,   ) are also known in English as "" postpositions "". Examples include    ( neun , topic marker) and    ( reul , object marker). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean particles .     [ edit ]   Interjection   Korean  interjections  (  ,  gamtansa ,   ) are also known in English as ""exclamations"". Examples include    ( ani , ""no""). For a larger list, see  wikt:Category:Korean interjections .     [ edit ]   Number       Main article:  Korean numerals       Korean  numbers  or numerals (  ,  sutja ,   ) consitute two regularly used sets: a native Korean set and a  Sino-Korean  set. The Sino-Korean system is nearly entirely based on the  Chinese numerals . The distinction between the two numeral systems is very important. Everything that can be counted will use one of the two systems, but seldom both. Sino-Korean words are sometimes used to mark ordinal usage: yeol beon ( ) means ""ten times"" while sip beon (() ()) means ""number ten."" The grouping of large numbers in Korean follow the Chinese tradition of myriads (10000) rather than thousands (1000) as is common in Europe and North America.     [ edit ]   Speech levels and honorifics       Main article:  Korean honorifics       The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean, and the grammar reflects this. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject referent is reflected in  honorifics , while that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in  speech level .     [ edit ]   Honorifics   When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a younger stranger, student, employee or the like. Nowadays, there are special endings which can be used on declarative, interrogative, and imperative sentences; and both honorific or normal sentences. They are made for easier and faster use of Korean.     [ edit ]   Speech levels   There are seven verb  paradigms  or  speech levels  in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation. [ citation needed ]  Unlike  honorifics   which are used to show respect towards the referent   speech levels  are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience. The names of the 7 levels are derived from the non-honorific  imperative  form of the verb    ( hada , ""do"") in each level, plus the suffix  ('che',  hanja :   ), which means ""style.""   The highest 6 levels are generally grouped together as  jondaenmal  (), while the lowest level ( haeche , ) is called  banmal  () in Korean.     [ edit ]   Vocabulary   The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words. Like Japanese and Vietnamese, more than 50% of the vocabulary (up to 60% by some estimates), especially words that denote abstract ideas, are  Sino-Korean words , [ 7 ]  either     directly borrowed from  Written Chinese , or   coined in Japan or Korea using  Chinese characters ,     in a similar way European languages borrow from Latin and Greek. Korean has two  number systems : one native, and one borrowed from Chinese.   To a much lesser extent, words have also occasionally been borrowed from  Mongolian ,  Sanskrit , and other languages. Conversely, the Korean language itself has also contributed some loanwords to other languages, most notably the  Tsushima dialect  of Japanese.   The vast majority of loanwords other than Sino-Korean come from modern times, 90% of which are from  English . [ 8 ]  Many words have also been borrowed from  Japanese  and  Western languages  such as  German  ( areubaiteu  part-time job,  allereugi  allergy). Some Western words were borrowed indirectly via Japanese, taking a Japanese sound pattern, for example dozen >     dsu  >     daseu . Most indirect Western borrowings are now written according to current Hangulization rules for the respective Western language, as if borrowed directly. There are a few more complicated borrowings such as German(y) (see  Names for Germany ), the first part of whose  endonym   [d.lant]  the Japanese approximated using the  kanji      doitsu  that were then accepted into the Korean language by their Sino-Korean pronunciation:     dok  +     il  =  Dogil . In South Korean official use, a number of other Sino-Korean country names have been replaced with phonetically oriented Hangulizations of the countries' endonyms or English names.   North Korean vocabulary shows a tendency to prefer native Korean over Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings, especially with recent political objectives aimed at eliminating foreign (mostly Chinese) influences on the Korean language in the North. By contrast, South Korean may have several Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings which tend to be absent in North Korean.     [ edit ]   Writing system       Korean writing systems           Hangul       Hanja       Hyangchal   Gugyeol   Idu       Mixed script       Korean romanization       Revised Romanization of Korean   McCune-Reischauer   Yale Romanization               Main article:  Hangul     See also:  Hangul consonant and vowel tables     In ancient times, the languages of the Korean peninsula were written using  Chinese characters , using  hyangchal  or  idu . Such systems were not popular because hanja is not well suited to the Korean language. Its use limited some cases and the aristocracy prefers  Classical Chinese  for its writing.   Korean is now mainly written in Hangul, the Korean alphabet promulgated in 1446 by  Sejong the Great ;  hanja may be mixed in  to write  Sino-Korean words . South Korea still teaches 1800 hanja characters in its schools, while the North abolished the use of hanja decades ago.   Below is a chart of the Korean alphabet's symbols and their canonical  IPA  values:     Consonants     Hangul                                                                        RR   b , p   d , t   j   g , k   pp   tt   jj   kk   p   t   ch   k   s   h   ss   m   n   ng       r , l           IPA   p   t      k   p   t      k   p   t      k   s   h   s   m   n      w   r   j         Vowels     Hangul                                                                      RR   i   e   oe   ae   a   o   u   eo   eu   ui   ye   yae   ya   yo   yu   yeo   wi   we   wae   wa   wo       IPA   i   e         a   o   u         i   je   j   ja   jo   ju   j   wi   we   w   wa   w       Modern Korean is written with  spaces  between  words , a feature not found in Chinese or Japanese. Korean  punctuation  marks are almost identical to Western ones. Traditionally, Korean was written in columns from top to bottom, right to left, but is now usually written in rows from left to right, top to bottom.     [ edit ]   Differences between North Korean and South Korean       Main article:  Korean language North-South differences       The Korean language used in the North and the South exhibits differences in pronunciation, spelling, grammar and vocabulary. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Pronunciation   In North Korea,  palatalization  of  /si/  is optional, and  //  can be pronounced as  [z]  in between vowels.   Words that are written the same way may be pronounced differently, such as the examples below. The pronunciations below are given in  Revised Romanization ,  McCune-Reischauer  and Hangul, the last of which represents what the Hangul would be if one writes the word as pronounced.       Word   Meaning   Pronunciation       North (RR/MR)   North (Hangul)   South (RR/MR)   South (Hangul)          wide   neo p tta (n p ta)      neo l tta (n l ta)             to read  (continuative form)   i l kko (i l ko)      i l kko (i l ko)             Amnok River   am r okgang (am r okkang)      am n okkang (am n okkang)             independence   dong r ip (tong r ip)      dong n ip (tong n ip)             idea / sense / conception   gwa ll yeom (kwa ll ym)      gwa nn yeom (kwa nn ym)          *   innovative   hyeoksin jj eok (hyksin tch k)      hyeoksin j eok (hyksin j k)          * Similar pronunciation is used in the North whenever the hanja """" is attached to a Sino-Korean word ending in ,  or . (In the South, this rule only applies when it is attached to any single-character Sino-Korean word.)     [ edit ]   Spelling   Some words are spelled differently by the North and the South, but the pronunciations are the same.       Word spelling   Meaning   Pronunciation (RR/MR)   Remarks       North   South             sunshine   haeppit (haepit)   The ""sai siot"" ('' used for indicating sound change) is almost never written out in the North.             cherry blossom   beotkkot (ptkkot)                cannot read   monnikda (monnikta)   Spacing.             Hallasan   hallasan (hallasan)   When a - combination is pronounced as  ll , the original Hangul spelling is kept in the North, while the Hangul is changed in the South.             rules   gyuyul (kyuyul)   In words where the original hanja is spelt """" or """" and follows a vowel, the initial  is not pronounced in the North, making the pronunciation identical with that in the South where the  is dropped in the spelling.         [ edit ]   Spelling and pronunciation   Some words have different spellings and pronunciations in the North and the South, some of which were given in the ""Phonology"" section above:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          ryeongryang (ryngryang)      yeongnyang (yngnyang)   strength   Korean words originally starting in  r  or  n  have their  r  or  n  dropped in the South Korean version if the sound following it is an  i  or  y  sound.          rodong (rodong)      nodong (nodong)   work   Korean words originally starting in  r  have their  r  changed to  n  in the South Korean version if the sound following it is a sound other than  i  or  y .          wonssu (wnssu)      wonsu (wnsu)   mortal enemy   ""Mortal enemy"" and ""head of state"" are homophones in the South. Possibly to avoid referring to  Kim Il-sung  /  Kim Jong-il  as the enemy, the second syllable of ""enemy"" is written and pronounced  in the North.          rajio (rajio)      radio (radio)   radio            u (u)      wi (wi)   on; above            anhae (anhae)      anae (anae)   wife            kkuba (kkuba)      kuba (k'uba)   Cuba   When transcribing foreign words from languages that do not have contrasts between aspirated and unaspirated stops, North Koreans generally use tensed stops for the unaspirated ones while South Koreans use aspirated stops in both cases.          pe (p'e)      pye (p'ye), pe (p'e)   lungs   All hanja pronounced as  pye  ( p'ye ) or  pe  ( p'e ) in the South are pronounced as  pe  ( p'e ) in the North. The spelling is also accordingly different.       In general, when transcribing place names, North Korea tends to use the pronunciation in the original language more than South Korea, which often uses the pronunciation in English. For example:       Original name   North Korea transliteration   English name   South Korea transliteration       Spelling   Pronunciation   Spelling   Pronunciaton       Ulaanbaatar      ullanbattareu (ullanbattar)   Ulan Bator      ullanbatoreu (ullanbat'or)       Kbenhavn      koeppenhabeun (k'oeppenhabn)   Copenhagen      kopenhagen (k'op'enhagen)       al-Qhirah      kkahira (kkahira)   Cairo      kairo (k'airo)         [ edit ]   Grammar   Some grammatical constructions are also different:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          doeyeotda (toeytta)      doeeotda (toetta)   past tense of  (doeda/toeda), ""to become""   All similar grammar forms of verbs or adjectives that end in  in the stem (i.e. , , , ,  and ) in the North use  instead of the South's .          gomawayo (komawayo)      gomawoyo (komawyo)   thanks   -irregular verbs in the North use  (wa) for all those with a positive ending vowel; this only happens in the South if the verb stem has only one syllable.          halgayo (halkayo)      halkkayo (halkkayo)   Shall we do?   Although the Hangul differ, the pronunciations are the same (i.e. with the tensed  sound).         [ edit ]   Vocabulary   Some vocabulary is different between the North and the South:       Word   Meaning   Remarks       North spelling   North pronun.   South spelling   South pronun.          munhwajutaek (munhwajut'aek)      apateu (ap'at')   Apartment     (appateu/appat') is also used in the North.          joseonmal (chosnmal)      han-gugeo(han'gugeo)   Korean language            gwakbap (kwakpap)      dosirak (tosirak)   lunch box           [ edit ]   Others   In the North,  guillemets     and    are the symbols used for quotes; in the South, quotation marks equivalent to the English ones,  and , are standard, although     and     are sometimes used in popular novels.     [ edit ]   Study by non-native speakers   The  United States '  Defense Language Institute  classifies Korean alongside  Arabic ,  Chinese , and  Japanese  as a Category IV language, meaning that 63 weeks of instruction (as compared to just 25 weeks for  French ,  Spanish ,  Portuguese , and  Italian ) are required to bring an English-speaking student to a limited working level of proficiency in which he or she has ""sufficient capability to meet routine social demands and limited job requirements"" and ""can deal with concrete topics in past, present, and future tense."" [ 10 ]  As a result, the study of the Korean language in the United States is dominated by  Korean American  heritage language students; they are estimated to form over 80% of all students of the language at non-military universities. [ 11 ]   However, Korean is considerably easier for speakers of certain other languages, such as Japanese, Mongolian and Turkic languages; in Japan, it is more widely studied by non-heritage learners. [ 12 ]  The  Korean Language Proficiency Test , an examination aimed at assessing non-native speakers' competence in Korean, was instituted in 1997; 17,000 people applied for the 2005 sitting of the examination.

Although a historical        relationship between Korean and Japanese has not been established, the two        languages have strikingly similar grammatical structures.          Some have hypothesized that        Korea and Japan stood at the end of two routes of large-scale migration in        ancient times: a northern route from Inner Asia and southern route from        southern China or Southeast Asia where the differences in the two        languages are in part a reflection of disparate ""northern"" and ""southern""        influences, with Korean showing more influence from the northern, Inner        Asian strain.          Both Korean and Japanese        possess what is sometimes called ""polite"" or ""honorific"" language, the use        of different levels of speech in addressing persons of superior, inferior,        or equal rank. These distinctions depend both on the use of different        vocabulary and upon basic structural differences in the words employed.        For example, in Korean the imperative ""go"" can be rendered kara when        speaking to an inferior or a child, kage when speaking to an adult        inferior, kaseyo when speaking to a superior, and kasipsio when speaking        to a person of still higher rank. The proper use of polite language, or        levels of polite speech, is an extremely complex and subtle matter. The        Korean language, like Japanese, is extremely sensitive to the nuances of        hierarchical human relationships. Two persons who meet for the first time        are expected to use the more distant or formal terms, but they will shift        to more informal or ""equal"" terms if they become friends. Younger people        invariably use formal language in addressing elders; the latter will use        ""inferior"" terms in ""talking down"" to those who are younger. Additionally        both employ particles after nouns to indicate case (the particle used to        indicate ""of"" as in ""the wife of Mr. Li"" is no in Japanese and ui in        Korean).          The Korean language may be        written using a mixture of Chinese ideograms (hancha) and a native Korean        alphabet known as hangul, or in hangul alone, much as in a more limited        way Indo-European languages sometimes write numbers using Arabic symbols        and at other times spell numbers out in their own alphabets or in some        combination of the two forms. See the section on this page for a further        discussion of the orginal of hangul.          Because of its greater variety        of sounds, Korean does not have the problem of the Japanese written        language, which some experts have argued needs to retain a sizable        inventory of Chinese characters to distinguish a large number of        potentially ambiguous homophones. Since 1948 the continued use of Chinese        characters in South Korea has been criticized by linguistic nationalists        and some educators and defended by cultural conservatives, who fear that        the loss of character literacy could cut younger generations off from a        major part of their cultural heritage.          Although the Korean and Chinese        languages are not related in terms of grammatical structure, more than 50        percent of all Korean vocabulary is derived from Chinese loanwords, a        reflection of the cultural dominance of China over 2 millennia. In many        cases there are two words--a Chinese loanword and an indigenous Korean        word -- meaning the same thing. The Chinese-based word in Korean sometimes        has a bookish or formal flavor. Koreans select one or the other variant to        achieve the proper register in speech or in writing, and to make subtle        distinctions of meaning in accordance with established usage.          Large numbers of Chinese        character compounds coined in Japan in the nineteenth or twentieth        centuries to translate modern Western scientific, technical, and political        vocabulary came into use in Korea during the colonial period. Post-1945        United States influence has been reflected in a number of English words        that have been absorbed into Korean.          Unlike Chinese, Korean does not        encompass dialects that are mutually unintelligible (with the notable        exception of the variant spoken on Cheju Island). There are, however,        regional variations both in vocabulary and pronunciation. Despite several        decades of universal education, similar variations also have been heard        between highly educated and professional speakers and Koreans of working        class or rural backgrounds. The ""Standard Language"" (p'yojuno) of South        Korea is derived from the language spoken in and around Seoul. More than        forty years of division has meant that there are also some divergences in        the development of the Korean language north and south of the        DMZ.         The North-South        Divide         It is unclear to what extent        the honorific language and its grammatical forms have been retained in the        north. However, according to a South Korean scholar, Kim Il Sung        ""requested people to use a special, very honorific deference system toward        himself and his family and, in a 1976 publication, Our Party's Language        Policy, rules formulated on the basis of Kim Il Sung's style of speech and        writing were advocated as the norm.""          The North Korean regime has a        policy that has attempted to eliminate as many foreign loanwords as        possible, as well as older terms of Chinese origin; Western loanwords are        also being dropped.          P'yongyang regards hancha, or        Chinese characters, as symbols of ""flunkeyism"" and has systematically        eliminated them from all publications. Klloja (The Worker), the monthly        KWP journal of the Central Committee, has been printed exclusively in        hangul since 1949. An attempt has also been made to create new words of        exclusively Korean origin. Parents are encouraged to give their children        Korean rather than Chinese-type names. Nonetheless, approximately 300        Chinese characters are still taught in North Korean schools.          North Koreans refer to their        language as ""Cultured Language"" (munhwa), which uses the regional dialect        of P'yongyang as its standard. North Korean sources vilify the Standard        Language language of the South as ""coquettish"" and ""decadent,"" corrupted        by English and Japanese loanwords, and full of nasal    twangs.                                Back to top        menu                                A Short        History of Hangul                       Prior to the middle of the        15th Century, the Korean language had, for over one thousand years, been        written using Chinese ideograms.  Korean sounds were represented        using Chinese characters with similar pronunciations.  This was        however unsatisfactory on two counts.  Firstly, the types of sounds        used in both languages are considerably different - a reflection in part        of the different origins of the two languages. The result was that it was        difficult to represent in writing many ""pure Korean"" sounds.(1) Secondly,        the Chinese writing system is not phonetic, making it somewhat difficult        to learn.  As a result, literacy in Korea was limited to the upper        classes and the aristocracy.          In the early 1440s, King Sejong        ( 세종대왕  -  r.1418-1450) of the Yi (or Choson  -  조선시대 ) Dynasty (1392-1910) commissioned a group of        Korean scholars to formulate a writing system that was suitable for the        Korean language and that was relatively easy to learn.  The system        they invented was called HunMinChongUm ( 훈민정음  -         ""Correct Sounds for the Instruction of the People"").         Originally the system comprised 28 letters but modern Hangul now contains        24 letters - 14 consonants and 10 vowels.           Hangul is an extremely easy        writing system to learn. Syllables are based on 2,3 or 4 letters grouped        into a character. A word comprises one or more syllables.  Each        syllable begins with a consonant (which may be silent) and is followed by        a vowel.  Syllables may end in one or two consonants.         Diphthongs are also able to be constructed using a combination of two        vowels.           Chinese characters (HanCha  -  한자 ) were still used widely until after the Korean        War.  Confucian scholarship imbued HanCha with a prestige which it        still enjoys in some circles of modern Korea.  During the Japanese        Colonial period, the use of Hangul was seen as nationalistic and was        suppressed by the Japanese.  After the Korean War nationalist        movements promoted the exclusive use of Hangul. With some further        development, including a slightly more sophisticated spelling convention,        Hangul was adopted as the official national script.           However, up until the early        1980s school children continued to learn Chinese characters (a minimum of        1000 called the ChonChaMun  -  천자문 ) because they        continued to be used in some newspapers and in academic manuscripts.        President Chon Du Hwan's administration removed HanCha from school        curricula although many schools have reintroduced the study of        HanCha.           As a result of a long history        of using the Chinese script and close cultural, religious and commercial        links between Korea and China, over half of the modern Korean vocabulary        came to be made up of Sino-Korean words, the pronunciation of which derive        directly from Chinese.  As a consequence of Chinese being a tonal        language and Korean not being tonal, there are many Sino-Korean words with        identical Korean pronunciations. This can result in confusion and HanCha        is often required to overcome this.  When Mr Kim Dae Jung         (김대중대통령) , was President        of the Republic of Korean (ROK - South Korea) he pushed        for a reintroduction of Chinese characters into school curricula and this        engendered considerable debate in South Korea. Since then the ROK Ministry        of Education declared that high school students are no longer legally        required to learn Chinese characters in order to graduate. Most students        weren't really studying Chinese characters anyway, so the law basically        caught up with reality.

Korean generally relies on context and other devices to communicate              whether a noun is definite or indefinite.                               For                example:   개가  밥을 먹어요                  Could mean "" The                 dog eats rice"" {we know which dog}; or "" A  dog eats rice""                {some dog that is unspecified or new to the                conversation}.                                                                                       Subject              and Object Markers                The subjects and objects              of Korean sentences are often marked with a post-fix that is              attached to the end of the noun.               The  subject marker               is  이/가  ( 이               when the noun ends              with a consonant and  가               when it ends with a              vowel).               The  object marker               is  를 / 을               ( 를  when the noun ends with a vowel and  을  when it ends with a consonant).                               For                example:   개 가   고기 를  먹어요  ([The] dog <subject marker                 가 >  meat <object marker                 를 >               eats)                                                                        Korean              Verbs - the infinitive form                If you look up a Korean              verb (such as  to eat ) in a English-Korean dictionary you will              find it in the infinitive form - that is with a  다                ending. This is much              the same as the  to  at the start of the infinitive form of              English verbs (eg.  to eat ). So the verb to eat is               먹다 .               To actually use               먹다  in conversation, the               다  is dropped to leave the verb stem              ( 먹 ) and then another ending is attached to the              verb stem to convey meaning like for example past tense              ( 았/었)  or future tense ( ㄹ/을 거예요 )              etc....                                                                           To              and From -   에   &   에서                The propositions               에   &   에서                are used for               to  and  from  places respectively (NOT for  to  and               from  people, time etc. - just places).

And now Windows VISTA .                       One of the        most frequently asked questions asked on Korean chat sites and web-boards        is how to get Korean language sites to display HanGul correctly in web        browsers running on English language operating systems.          Here is a test of whether our        machine is already setup to read Hangul:                                                                       한늘                                 If the text on the left does        not match the picture on the right then you are not set up correctly and        need to explore one of the solutions listed below.....         There are a number of solutions        listed below:                                     Windows 95/98/ME : Install Microsoft's  free   Korean Language IME . (or upgrade to Windows 2000        ;-)          Simply download it from         here  (2 MB - you should download the version        with the ""language pack"" that includes a unicode HanGul font).          Then simply run the executable        (called ""komodo.exe"" when I last downloaded it) to install it. This will        install the IME and give you a blue IME icon in your taskbar - like        this:                 You should be able to use the        IME to type Hangul in applications that are IME-enabled like Microsoft        Outlook (email program) and some internet sites.         Windows 2000           & XP : Win2000 and XP support Korean internally - all you        need to do is go to the  Keyboard properties  in the  Control        Panel  ( Start  >>  Setting  >>  Control        Panel ), select the I nput Locales tab  and add Korean as an input        language.

Handbook of Korean Vocabulary: An Approach to        Word Recognition and Comprehension, by Miho Choo,        Paperback: 384 pages, Publisher: University of Hawaii        Press        This book is comprehensive; it is comprised of both        native Korean roots and lists of Sino-Korean words        organized by character and alphabetized according to        Korean pronunciation. Sino-Korean word lists for each        character include both words in which the character        appears first and words in which the character appears        last. For example, the entry under ""dae"" meaning ""big,""        includes ""daehakyo"" (university) and ""hwakdae""        (enlarge).
