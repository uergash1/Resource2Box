Editorial Review for Hotel Belleclaire      – by Citysearch Staff                   In Short Housed in a landmark building (circa 1903) on the Upper West Side, this moderately priced hotel has less than a moderate amount of facilities and amenities. Rooms are quite spacious, however, upper floors are bright, and guests will be in walking distance of Central Park, the American Museum of Natural History (which includes the Rose Center for Earth and Space) and the New York Historical Society.

I booked a big room at this hotel for my cousin's bachelorette party and it worked out really well for us. We couldn't have even  gotten a small room for the same price at a ""trendy"" hotel. It's listed as a ""budget hotel"" but it's not cheezy like a Holiday Inn or anything. It's small and quaint and staff is friendly. I think it's a great deal for your money, and at a great location.              Pros:  amazing prices, upper west side location                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Good...if you're on a budget                                                            10/21/2002 Posted by  Stephanie_Wilson         The Belleclaire is perfect if you're more interested in spending your money seeing New York than on a hotel room.  The room was relatively clean but small.  The staff was wonderful and willing to help with any needs.  And the elevators (though very tiny) were a plus!  Lots of great little restaurants nearby:  Manhattan Diner (free delivery), Niko's Mediterranean Grill, Ruby Foo's.  And the subway is only two blocks away!

Interrupted blood flow to your heart can damage or destroy a part of the heart muscle.  Years ago, a heart attack was often fatal. Thanks to better awareness of heart attack signs and symptoms and improved treatments, most people who have a heart attack now survive.  Your overall lifestyle — what you eat, how often you exercise and the way you deal with stress — plays a role in your  Recovery  from a heart attack. In addition, a healthy lifestyle can help you prevent a first or subsequent heart attack by controlling risk factors that contribute to the narrowing of the coronary arteries that supply blood to your heart.  Heart attack Symptoms Common signs and symptoms of a heart attack include:  pressure , fullness or a squeezing  pain  in the center of your chest that lasts for more than a few minutes  Pain extending beyond your chest to your shoulder, arm, back, or even to your teeth and jaw Increasing episodes of chest pain  Prolonged pain in the upper abdomen Shortness of breath  Sweating Impending sense of doom Fainting Nausea  and  Vomiting Signs and symptoms of a heart attack in  Women  may be different or less noticeable than heart attack symptoms in men. In addition to the symptoms above, heart attack symptoms in women can include:  Abdominal pain or "" Heartburn ""  Clammy  Skin Lightheadedness or  Dizziness Unusual or unexplained fatigue Not all people who have heart attacks experience the same ones or experience them to the same degree. Many heart attacks  Aren 't as dramatic as the ones you've seen on TV. Some people have no symptoms at all. Still, the more signs and symptoms you have, the greater the likelihood that you may be having a heart attack.  A heart attack can occur anytime — at work or play, while you're resting, or while you're in motion. Some heart attacks strike suddenly, but many people who experience a heart attack have warning signs and symptoms hours, days or weeks in advance. The earliest predictor of an attack may be recurrent chest pain ( Angina ) that's triggered by exertion and relieved by rest. Angina is caused by temporary, insufficient blood flow to the heart, also known as ""cardiac ischemia.""  Heart attack Causes The medical term for a heart attack is "" Myocardial infarction ."" ""Myo"" refers to ""muscle;"" ""cardio"" refers to ""heart;"" ""infarct"" refers to "" Death  of tissue from lack of oxygen."" Like any muscle, the heart needs a steady supply of blood. Without blood, heart cells are injured, causing pain or pressure. If blood flow isn't restored, heart cells can die and scar tissue can form, replacing working heart tissue. The lack of blood flow to the heart also may trigger irregular heart rhythms that can be fatal.  A heart attack occurs when one or more of the arteries supplying your heart with oxygen-rich blood become blocked. These arteries are called coronary arteries and encircle your heart like a crown. Over time, a coronary artery can become narrowed from the buildup of cholesterol. This buildup — collectively known as plaques — in arteries throughout the body is called  Atherosclerosis .  During a heart attack, one of these plaques can rupture and a blood clot forms on the site of the rupture. If the clot is large enough, it can block the flow of blood through the artery. When your coronary arteries have narrowed due to atherosclerosis, the condition is known as  Coronary Artery Disease . Coronary artery disease is the major underlying cause of heart attacks.  An uncommon cause of a heart attack is a spasm of a coronary artery that shuts down blood flow to part of the heart muscle. Drugs, such as  cocaine , can cause such a life-threatening spasm.  A heart attack is the end of a process that typically evolves over several hours. With each passing minute, more heart tissue is deprived of blood and deteriorates or dies. However, if blood flow can be restored in time, damage to the heart can be limited or prevented.  Heart attack Risk factors Certain factors, called coronary risk factors, increase your risk of a heart attack. These factors contribute to the unwanted buildup of deposits (atherosclerosis) that narrows arteries throughout your body, including arteries to your heart. Coronary risk factors include:  Tobacco smoke. smoking  and long-term exposure to secondhand smoke damage the interior walls of arteries — including arteries to your heart — allowing deposits of cholesterol and other substances to collect and hamper blood flow. Smoking also increases the risk of deadly blood clots forming and causing a heart attack.  High  Blood pressure .  Blood pressure is determined by the amount of blood your heart pumps and the amount of resistance to blood flow in your arteries. Over time, high blood pressure can damage arteries that feed your heart by accelerating atherosclerosis. The risk of high blood pressure increases as you age, but the main culprits for most Americans are  Eating  a diet too high in salt and being overweight. High blood pressure can also be an inherited problem. High blood cholesterol or  Triglyceride  levels.  Cholesterol is a major part of the deposits that can narrow arteries throughout your body, including those that supply your heart. A high level of the wrong kind of cholesterol in your blood increases your risk of a heart attack. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (the ""bad"" cholesterol) is most likely to narrow arteries. A high LDL level is undesirable and is often a byproduct of a diet high in saturated fats and cholesterol. A high level of triglycerides, a type of blood fat related to your diet, also is undesirable. However, a high level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (the ""good"" cholesterol), which helps the body clean up excess cholesterol, is desirable and lowers your risk of heart attack.  Lack of physical activity.  An inactive lifestyle contributes to high blood cholesterol levels and  Obesity . Conversely, people who get regular  Aerobic Exercise  have better cardiovascular  Fitness , which decreases their overall risk of heart attack. Exercise is also beneficial in lowering high blood pressure. Obesity.  Obese people have a high proportion of body fat (a  Body Mass Index  of 30 or higher). Obesity raises the risk of heart disease because it's associated with high blood cholesterol levels, high blood pressure and  Diabetes .  Diabetes.  Diabetes is the inability of your body to adequately produce or respond to insulin properly. Insulin, a hormone secreted by your pancreas, allows your body to use  Glucose , which is a form of sugar from foods. Diabetes can occur in childhood, but it appears more often in middle age and among overweight people. Diabetes greatly increases your risk of a heart attack. Stress.  You may respond to stress in ways that can increase your risk of a heart attack. If you're under stress, you may overeat or smoke from  Nervous  tension. Too much stress, as well as  Anger , can also raise your blood pressure. Alcohol.  Consumed in moderation, alcohol helps raise HDL levels — the ""good"" cholesterol — and can have a protective effect against heart attack. Men should have no more than two drinks a day, and women should have no more than one. Excessive drinking can raise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, increasing your risk of heart attack.  Family history of heart attack.  If your siblings, parents or grandparents have had early heart attacks, you may be at risk, too. Your family may have a genetic condition that raises unwanted blood cholesterol levels. High blood pressure also can run in families.  Homocysteine, C-reactive  Protein  and fibrinogen.  People who have higher blood levels of homocysteine, C-reactive protein and fibrinogen appear to have an increased risk of heart disease. Some research suggests homocysteine levels can be reduced with  Folic acid  supplements and a  Healthy diet . Fibrinogen and C-reactive protein levels may be reduced by modifying other risk factors for heart disease, such as quitting smoking, lowering cholesterol and exercising. You can modify or eliminate many of these risk factors to reduce your chances of having a first or second heart attack. However, you can't change some risk factors, such as heredity and gender. Men are generally at greater risk than are women of heart attacks. However, the risk for women increases sometime after  Menopause , usually after age 55. If your father had heart disease before 55 or your mother had heart trouble before 65, your risk of developing heart disease is greater.  Heart attack When to seek medical advice During a heart attack, some people waste precious minutes because they don't recognize the important signs and symptoms — or they deny them. Some people also delay calling for help because they're afraid to risk the embarrassment of a false alarm.  However, one of the most important things you can do to increase your survival after a heart attack is to recognize what's happening and take immediate action. Of the people who die of heart attacks, about half die within the first hour after the onset of signs and symptoms.  Don't ""tough out"" the symptoms of a heart attack, such as pressure or pain in your chest, for more than five minutes. Call 911 or other emergency medical services for help.  If you don 't have access to emergency medical services, have someone drive you to the nearest hospital, such as a neighbor or friend. Drive yourself only as a last resort, if there are absolutely no other options. Driving yourself puts you and others at risk if your condition suddenly worsens.  If it turns out you weren't having a heart attack, doctors may be able to pinpoint the cause of your signs and symptoms and treat them.  Heart attack Tests and  Diagnosis Ideally, your doctor should screen you during regular physical exams for risk factors that can lead to a heart attack.  If you're having a heart attack or suspect you're having one, screening and diagnosis will likely happen in an emergency setting. You'll be asked to describe your symptoms and will have your blood pressure, pulse and  Temperature  checked. You'll be hooked up to a heart monitor and will almost immediately start to have tests done to determine if you are indeed having a heart attack. The medical staff will listen to your heart and lung sounds with a stethoscope. You'll be asked about your  health  history and the history of heart disease in your family. The tests your doctors order will help determine whether your signs and symptoms, such as chest pain, signal a heart attack or another condition. These tests include:  Electrocardiogram  (ECG).  This is the first test done to diagnose a heart attack. It's often done while you are being asked questions about your symptoms. This test records the electrical activity of your heart via electrodes attached to your skin. Impulses are recorded as ""waves"" displayed on a monitor or printed on paper. Because injured heart muscle  Doesn 't conduct electrical impulses normally, the ECG may show that a heart attack has occurred or is in progress. Blood Tests .  Certain heart enzymes slowly leak out into your blood if your heart has been damaged by a heart attack. Emergency room doctors will take samples of your blood to test for the presence of these enzymes.  Additional tests If you've had a heart attack or one is occurring, doctors will take immediate steps to treat your condition. You may also undergo these additional tests:  Chest X-ray.  An X-ray image of your chest allows your doctor to check the size and shape of your heart and its blood vessels.  Nuclear scan.  This test helps identify blood flow problems to your heart. Small amounts of radioactive material, such as thallium, are injected into your bloodstream. Special cameras can detect the radioactive material as it flows through your heart and lungs. Areas of reduced blood flow to the heart muscle — through which less of the radioactive material flows — appear as dark spots on the scan. Echocardiogram.  This test uses sound waves to produce an image of your heart. During an echocardiogram, sound waves are directed at your heart from a transducer, a wand-like device, held on your chest. The sound waves bounce off your heart and are reflected back through your chest wall and processed electronically to provide video images of your heart. An echocardiogram can help identify whether an area of your heart has been damaged by a heart attack and isn't pumping normally or at peak capacity.  Coronary catheterization (angiogram).  This test can show if your coronary arteries are narrowed or blocked. A liquid dye is injected into the arteries of your heart through a long, thin tube (catheter) that's fed through an artery, usually in your leg, to the arteries in your heart. As the dye fills your arteries, the arteries become visible on X-ray, revealing areas of blockage. Additionally, while the catheter is in position, your doctor may treat the blockage by performing an angioplasty, also known as coronary artery balloon dilation, balloon angioplasty and percutaneous coronary intervention. Angioplasty uses tiny balloons threaded through a blood vessel and into a coronary artery to widen the blocked area. In most cases, a mesh tube (stent) is also placed inside the artery to hold it open more widely and prevent re-narrowing in the future.  In the days or weeks following your heart attack, you may also undergo a stress test. Stress tests measure how your heart and blood vessels respond to exertion. You may walk on a treadmill or pedal a stationary bike while attached to an ECG machine. Or you may receive a drug intravenously that stimulates your heart similar to exercise. Stress tests help doctors determine the best long-term treatment for you.  Heart attack Complications Heart attack complications are often related to the damage sustained by your heart during a heart attack. This damage can lead to the following conditions:  Abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias).  If your heart muscle is damaged from a heart attack, electrical ""short circuits"" can develop resulting in abnormal heart rhythms, some of which can be serious, even fatal. Heart Failure .  The amount of damaged tissue in your heart may be so extensive that the remaining heart muscle can't do an adequate job of pumping blood out of your heart. This decreases blood flow to tissues and organs throughout your body and may produce shortness of breath, fatigue, and  Swelling  in your ankles and feet. Heart failure may be a temporary problem that remedies itself after your heart, which has been stunned by a heart attack, recovers over a few days to weeks. However, it can also be a chronic condition resulting from extensive and permanent damage to your heart following your heart attack.  Heart rupture.  Areas of heart muscle weakened by a heart attack can rupture, leaving a hole in part of the heart. This rupture is often rapidly fatal. Valve problems.  Heart valves damaged during a heart attack may develop severe, life-threatening leakage problems. Heart attack Treatments and drugs During a heart attack, act immediately. Take these steps:  Call for emergency medical help.  If you even suspect you're having a heart attack, don't hesitate. Immediately call 911 or your local emergency number. If you don't have access to emergency medical services, have someone drive you to the nearest hospital. Drive yourself only as a last resort, if there are absolutely no other options. Driving yourself puts you and others at risk if your condition suddenly worsens. Take nitroglycerin.  If your doctor has prescribed nitroglycerin, take as instructed while awaiting the arrival of emergency medical personnel. If you encounter someone who is unconscious from a presumed heart attack, call for emergency medical help and, if you have received training in emergency procedures, begin cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). This helps deliver oxygen to the body and  Brain . If you're not trained in emergency procedures, doctors recommend skipping  Mouth -to-mouth rescue breathing and proceeding directly to chest compression. Do chest compressions at a rate of 100 a minute.  In the initial minutes, a heart attack can also trigger ventricular fibrillation, a condition in which the heart quivers uselessly. Without immediate treatment, ventricular fibrillation leads to sudden death. The timely use of an automatic external defibrillator (AED) that shocks the heart back into a normal rhythm can provide emergency treatment before a person suffering a heart attack reaches the hospital.  Once you reach a hospital emergency room and it's clear you're having a heart attack, you may be treated with medications, undergo an invasive procedure or both — depending on the severity of your condition and the amount of damage to your heart.  Medications With each passing minute after a heart attack, more tissue is deprived of oxygen and deteriorates or dies. The main way to prevent progressive damage is to restore blood flow quickly.  Medications given to treat a heart attack include:  Aspirin.  You may be given aspirin by emergency medical personnel soon after they arrive or as soon as you get to the hospital. Aspirin inhibits blood clotting, thus helping maintain blood flow through a narrowed artery. Take an aspirin yourself while waiting for help to arrive only if your doctor has previously recommended that you do so if you have symptoms of a heart attack. Thrombolytics.  These drugs, also called clot-busters, help dissolve a blood clot that's blocking blood flow to your heart. The earlier you receive a thrombolytic drug following a heart attack, the greater the chance you will survive and lessen the damage to your heart. Superaspirins.  Doctors in the emergency room may give you other drugs which are somewhat similar to aspirin to help prevent new clots from forming. These include medications such as clopidogrel (Plavix) and others called platelet IIb/IIIa receptor blockers. Other blood-thinning medications.  You'll likely be given other medications, such as heparin, to make your blood less ""sticky"" and less likely to form more dangerous clots. Heparin is given intravenously or by an injection under your skin and is usually used during the first few days after a heart attack.  Pain relievers.  If your chest pain or associated pain is great, you may receive a pain reliever, such as morphine, to alleviate your discomfort. Nitroglycerin.  This  Medication , used to treat chest pain (angina), temporarily opens arterial blood vessels, improving blood flow to and from your heart.  Beta blockers.  These medications help relax your heart muscle, slow your heartbeat and decrease blood pressure making your heart's job easier. Beta blockers can limit the amount of heart muscle damage and prevent future heart attacks.  Cholesterol-lowering medications.  Examples include  Statins , niacin, fibrates and bile acid sequestrants. These drugs help lower levels of unwanted blood cholesterol and may be helpful if given soon after a heart attack to improve survival. Surgical and other procedures In addition to medications, you may undergo one of the following procedures to treat your heart attack:  Coronary angioplasty and stenting.  Emergency angioplasty opens blocked coronary arteries, letting blood flow more freely to your heart. Doctors insert a long, thin tube (catheter) that's passed through an artery, usually in your leg, to a blocked artery in your heart. This catheter is equipped with a special balloon tip. Once in position, the balloon tip is briefly inflated to open up a blocked coronary artery. At the same time, a metal mesh stent may be inserted into the artery to keep it open long term, restoring blood flow to the heart. Depending on your condition, you doctor may opt to place a stent coated with a slow-releasing medication to help keep your artery open.  Coronary angioplasty is done at the same time as a coronary catheterization (angiogram), a procedure that doctors do first to locate narrowed arteries to the heart. When getting an angioplasty for heart attack treatment, the sooner the better. If an angioplasty is performed days or weeks after you've been stabilized with a completely blocked artery, there may not be any benefit.  Coronary artery bypass surgery.  In rare cases, doctors may perform emergency bypass surgery at the time of a heart attack. Bypass surgery involves sewing veins or arteries in place at a site beyond a blocked or narrowed coronary artery (bypassing the narrowed section), restoring blood flow to the heart. Or your doctor may suggest that you have this procedure after your heart has had time to recover from your heart attack. Once blood flow to your heart is restored and your condition is stable following your heart attack, you may be hospitalized for observation. Because physical exertion and emotional upset place stress on your heart, be sure to rest. Visitors are usually limited to family members and close friends.  Rehabilitation The goal of emergency treatment of a heart attack is to restore blood flow and save heart tissue. The purpose of subsequent treatment is to promote healing of your heart and prevent another heart attack.  Some hospitals offer  Cardiac Rehabilitation  programs that may start while you're in the hospital and, depending on the severity of your attack, continue for weeks to months  After You Return  home. Cardiac rehabilitation programs generally focus on three main areas — medications, lifestyle changes and emotional issues.  Heart attack Prevention It's never too late to take steps to prevent a heart attack — even if you've already had one. Drug therapy has become an increasingly important part of reducing the risk of a second heart attack and helping a damaged heart function better. Lifestyle factors also play a critical role in heart attack prevention and recovery.  Medications Doctors typically prescribe drug therapy for people who've had a heart attack or who are at high risk of having one. Medications that help the heart function more effectively or reduce heart attack risk may include:  Blood-thinning medications.  Aspirin makes your blood less ""sticky"" and likely to clot. Doctors recommend a daily aspirin for most people who've had a heart attack. Your doctor may, in some cases, prescribe a stronger blood thinner than aspirin.  Doctors may prescribe aspirin and an anti-clotting drug such as clopidogrel (Plavix) for people undergoing an angioplasty or stent procedure to open narrowed coronary arteries, both before and after the procedure.  If you're taking aspirin to help prevent a heart attack, be aware that taking the painkiller ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) at the same time may increase the risk of  Gastrointestinal Problems  and may interfere with the heart benefits of aspirin. If you need to take a pain-relieving medication for a condition such as arthritis, discuss with your doctor which is best for you.  Beta blockers.  These drugs lower your heart rate and blood pressure, reducing demand on your heart and helping to prevent further heart attacks. Many patients will need to take beta blockers for the rest of their lives following a heart attack.  Angiotensin-converting  Enzyme  (ACE) inhibitors.  Doctors prescribe ACE inhibitors for most patients after heart attacks, especially for those who have had a moderate to severe heart attack that has reduced the heart's pumping capacity. These drugs allow blood to flow from your heart more easily, prevent some of the complications of heart attacks, and make a second heart attack less likely.  Cholesterol-lowering medications.  A variety of medications, including statins, niacin, fibrates and bile acid sequestrants, can help lower your levels of unwanted blood cholesterol. The majority of people who've had a heart attack take cholesterol-lowering medications — drugs that help lower the risk of a second heart attack. These medications can help prevent future heart attacks even if your cholesterol was not very high at the time of the heart attack. Lifestyle How you live your life can largely affect the health of your heart. Taking the following steps can help you not only prevent but also recover from a heart attack:  Don't smoke.  If you smoke, the single most important thing you can do to improve your heart's health is to stop. It's very hard to stop smoking by yourself, so ask your doctor to prescribe a treatment plan to help you kick the habit. Check your cholesterol.  Have your blood cholesterol levels checked regularly, through a  Blood test  at your doctor's office. If ""bad"" cholesterol levels are undesirably high, your doctor can prescribe changes to your diet and medications to help lower the numbers and protect your cardiovascular health.  Get regular medical checkups.  Some of the major risk factors for heart attack — high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes — cause no symptoms in their early stages. Your doctor can perform tests to check that you're free of these conditions. If a problem exists, you and your doctor can manage it early to prevent complications that can lead to a heart attack.  Control your blood pressure.  Have your blood pressure checked every two years. Your doctor may recommend more frequent measurement if you have high blood pressure or a history of coronary artery disease. Exercise regularly.  Years ago, doctors forbade exercise following a heart attack for fear it would cause another. But regular exercise helps improve heart muscle function following a heart attack. Exercise is now a major component of a cardiac rehabilitation program. Exercise helps prevent a heart attack by helping you to achieve and maintain a healthy weight and control diabetes, elevated cholesterol and high blood pressure. Exercise doesn't have to be vigorous. For example, walking 30 minutes a day, five days a week can improve your health. Maintain a healthy weight.  Excess weight strains your heart and can contribute to  High Cholesterol , high blood pressure and diabetes.  Losing weight  can lower your risk of heart disease. Eat a heart-healthy diet.  Too much saturated fat and cholesterol in your diet can narrow arteries to your heart. If you've had a heart attack, limit fat and cholesterol — and  Sodium . A diet high in sodium can raise your blood pressure. Follow your doctor's and dietitian's advice on  Eating a heart-healthy diet . Prepare heart-healthy meals together as a family. Fish is part of a heart-healthy diet. It contains omega-3 fatty acids, which help improve blood cholesterol levels and prevent blood clots. Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables. Fruits and vegetables contain  Antioxidants  — nutrients that help prevent everyday wear and tear on your coronary arteries. Manage stress.  To reduce your risk of a heart attack, reduce stress in your day-to-day activities. Rethink workaholic habits and find healthy ways to minimize or deal with stressful events in your life. Consume alcohol in moderation.  Drinking more than one to two alcoholic drinks a day raises blood pressure, so cut back on your drinking if necessary. From a heart-healthy standpoint, one to two drinks daily is fine for men, and women can have one alcoholic beverage a day. One drink is equivalent to 12 ounces of beer, 4 ounces of wine or 1.5 ounces of an 80-proof liquor. Heart attack Coping and support Having a heart attack is a scary experience. Even if your doctor says you're OK, you may still be afraid. How will this affect your life? Will you be able to get back to work or resume activities you enjoy? Even more frightening — will it happen again?  Fear is just one of the many emotions you and your family must deal with. Other emotions that can be particularly difficult to cope with after a heart attack may include:  Anger.  You may be angry and wonder: ""Why did I have to have a heart attack, and why now?"" It's normal to feel some resentment after a heart attack.  Guilt.  Family members may feel scared at first and then guilty about your heart attack. Some may even feel that they're somehow responsible for doing something that gave you a heart attack.  Depression .  Depression is common after a heart attack. You may feel that you can no longer do things you used to do — that you're not the same person you were before the heart attack.  These feelings are common, and openly discussing them with your doctor, a family member or a friend may help you better cope. You need to take care of yourself mentally as well as physically after a heart attack. Exercising and participating in cardiac rehabilitation sessions with other people who are recovering from a heart attack may help you work through these feelings.  Sex after a heart attack  Many people worry that sex after a heart attack will be too strenuous on their hearts. However, most people can safely return to sexual activity after recovering from a heart attack. Each person has a different timeline, depending on his or her level of physical comfort, psychological readiness and previous sexual activity.  The demands  Sexual intercourse  places on your heart approximate those of taking a brisk walk, scrubbing a floor, or climbing one or two flights of stairs. In a way, sexual activity parallels any other physical exertion — your heart rate, breathing rate and blood pressure level increase. Ask your doctor when it's safe to resume sexual activity. With time, you'll likely be able to resume your normal sexual patterns.  Some heart medications, such as beta blockers, may affect sexual function. However, sexual dysfunction following a heart attack is more often due to depression or  Anxiety  than to medications. If you're having problems with sexual dysfunction, talk to your doctor. He or she may be able to help you pinpoint the problem and seek the appropriate treatment.  You and your family may have a lot of questions and concerns following your heart attack. If  So, it  might be helpful to talk to others who are experiencing some of the same things as you and your family. Many cardiac rehabilitation programs offer counseling services and support groups for heart attack survivors.  Surviving a heart attack doesn't mean that life as you knew it is over. On the contrary, most people lead full, active lives after a heart attack. But it may mean making some positive changes in your daily habits, being patient as you recover and adopting a can-do attitude.

By MIKE POULOS  Special to the Journal & Topics Newspapers    The facts and figures about French Lick Resort don't do it justice. This luxurious resort complex tucked into the hilly terrain of south-central Indiana will blow you away the moment you lay your eyes on it. A scenic setting couldn't be more impressive---or more imagined---than the location of the two full-service hotels, casino and three golf courses nestled into this heavily forested region of rolling hills located next to the towns of French Lick and West Baden Springs...the home town of NBA legend Larry Bird.  How this swanky resort 300 miles south of Chicago got to be the way it did goes way, way back, much of it hinged on unique circumstances.  The first hotel of any kind in French Lick was built in 1845 by Dr. William Bowles and appropriately named the French Lick Springs Hotel. It drew guests from as far as 100 miles away to partake in the naturally occurring ""miracle waters"" from subterranean sulfur springs. The original West Baden Springs Hotel in neighboring West Baden Springs was constructed by Dr. John Lane in 1850 and was named Mile Lick Inn. It, too, benefited from the area's natural spring waters. These two hotels formed the backbone of the resort, which over time have expanded to include a plethora of activities for the guests.  Lee W. Sinclair transformed the West Baden Springs Hotel into a sophisticated resort when he assumed ownership in 1888 and added an opera house, golf courses, church, ball field, pony rides and bicycle trails. A fire ravaged the hotel in 1901 and those portions that were salvageable along with a scant $414,000 budget---and one-year timeline---rebuilt the hotel, which Sinclair modeled after the grandest spas of Europe. At that time and until 1968, it sported the largest free-span dome in the world and was dubbed the ""Eighth Wonder of the World"".  This magnificent six-story hotel has had a colorful history including uses as a hospital, monastery and college...until 1983 when it closed, badly in need of repairs. Through an anonymous contribution, the Historic Landmarks Foundation of Indiana purchased the vacant West Baden Springs Hotel in 1996 and in that same year, philanthropists Bill and Gayle Cook, and associated groups, participated in partial restoration of the hotel and its grounds. In 2005, CFC Incorporated, a Cook Group Company, purchased both the West Baden Springs and French Lick Springs hotels and began a long-term $450 million historic renovation project. The upgrade included development of a new casino, restoration of two existing golf courses and creation of a third, designed by legendary Pete Dye...all for the exclusive use by guests.  The West Baden Springs Hotel is a marvel to behold and is again enjoying its national and international fame. It has been named a National Historic Landmark, a National Register of Historic Places property, and a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark. Today, the two hotels accommodate 689 luxurious rooms and suites, a state-of-the-art spa and fitness center, a 10,000 sq. ft. meeting place, a 109,000 sq. ft. conference center, a 30,000 sq. ft. domed Atrium, a 13,000 sq. ft. ballroom with a 6,700 sq. ft. junior ballroom, a combined 15 dining options from elegant cuisine to casual fare, a 42,000 sq. ft. casino, bowling alley and game arcade, retail shopping, train rides, historical tours, carriage rides and hayrides, pony rides, bicycle trails and garden/nature walks.  For golf enthusiasts, there are 45 holes of championship golf that includes practice and training facilities. There is the Donald Ross Course at French Lick, the Pete Dye Course at French Lick (which doesn't fully open until spring 2009), and the nine-hole Tom Bendelow Course, which used to be Valley Links at French Lick. To complement these outstanding golf courses is a 60,000 sq. ft. Sports & Exhibits Complex situated at the Tom Bendelow Course featuring an indoor putting green, 40 yard driving range for up to 10 golfers, video analysis of your golf swing, golf lessons, and five tennis courts.  World-renowned architect Donald Ross originally constructed the course that bears his name in 1917.  It has been the home to many regional and national tournaments including the 1924 PGA Championship won by Walter Hagen. This is a links-type course with deep green-sided bunkers and severely undulating greens.  Nearly $5 million was poured in to renovate it.  The furthest of the tees plays to about 6,500 yards...but it feels more like 7,500 yards.   Seasoned golfers may overlook the nine-hole Tom Bendelow Course because it isn't a fully developed 18-hole course, but at 3,500 yards, it plays long and though it is a links course, it features some narrow fairways bordered by dense forested land. This course was molded out of what was originally a short 18-hole course (Valley Links) and has been reconfigured to offer maximum challenge for even experienced golfers. This course is closest to the two hotels.  The third and most impressive course is the Pete Dye layout, appropriately named after its famed architect, who, like Donald Ross, is one of the most famous golf course designers in the world. As the story goes, Dye did his initial outlay of this course over a short stay in the area not many years ago sketching his design onto a napkin. Three of the 18-holes are still being shaped and seeded and are expected to be completed in spring 2009. This course is undulating with broad doglegs and sloped greens. If you play from the back tees, it's an incredible 8,057 yards. There aren't as many bunkers, but a unique feature of the Pete Dye Course is that it is fitted into a more diverse topographic setting, tucked into the natural hilly terrain. It features more vertical elevation, making for some amazing vistas. Pete Dye Courses don't include a lot of trees either.  As for some of my personal experiences playing these impressive courses, all I can say is I'm glad there were no TV cameras rolling. As to the Donald Ross Course, it certainly lives up to its reputation as being long, undulating and uncompromisingly deceptive in terms of judging distances and slopes. There were several occasions when I played a long putt (which there were many of) to break to the left only to see the ball break to the right...and yet your perspective of how the green is sloped against the horizon dictates otherwise. That accounted for a lot of extra strokes...but then again, who's counting?  The nine-hole Tom Bendelow Course is less intimidating than the other two, not taking into consideration it is shorter but primarily due to less hazards and fairways that don't twist and bend as much...and greens that are less washboard.  Of the three, this course is more picturesque...tree-lined or composed of thick vegetation.  With less to get into trouble with, your average golfer stands a better chance of making par (hey...what's that?).  When it comes to determining the difficulty of a golf course, there is a calculation that computes certain important factors called ""slope rating.""  Generally, courses in the 130s and 140s provide maximum challenge to even the pros Dave Harner, director of Golf for the French Lick Resort courses, said the Ross is in the mid-120s (varies depending on which tees you play from) and the Pete Dye Course, when it is completed, is significantly higher.  That brings me to the famed Pete Dye Course, which if you don't hit relatively straight and relatively far, you're in big trouble. Since I do neither except for an occasional ""surprise"" shot, I found the nine holes I played incredibly difficult.    Green fees vary seasonally for these courses and since my visit was after summertime hours, with fall into full swing, the fees were much lower ($85 weekdays and $115 weekends at Donald Ross and $20 weekdays at Tom Bendelow).  Summer rates in 2008 were $155 weekdays and $270 weekends at Donald Ross and $129 weekdays and $185 weekends at Tom Bendelow.    The casino is connected to the French Lick Springs Hotel and Conference Center and features a 42,000 sq. ft. single-level gaming room housing 1,200 slot machines and table games, including blackjack, roulette, 3-card poker and craps. There is an entertainment lounge with TVs and a permanent stage for musical performances and a non-smoking gaming room as well. Dining options include a bistro, casual deli, the Grand Colonnade Buffet along with several dining choices connected to the hotel.   There is a continuous shuttle bus pick-up and drop-off service from the West Baden Springs Hotel and other resort attractions in-between.  As much as the French Lick Springs Hotel is an impressive structure, built in 1901, it is hard to top the West Baden Springs Hotel (1902) with that amazing 30,000 sq. ft. vaulted Atrium.  It was the world's largest self-supporting dome until the Houston Astrodome was completed in 1968.  The Spa at the French Lick Springs Hotel features 24 full-service treatment and relaxation rooms, hair salon and fitness center, which has 36 station including five treadmills with built-in TVs.  Other attractions associated with the resort complex and in some cases extending into the towns of French Lick and West Baden Springs are plentiful.  There is a 4.5-mile bike trail that connects to most of these attractions such as the two hotels, casino and Bendelow Golf Course.  There is the Joe Louis Bridge named in honor of boxing legend Joe Louis who trained and stayed at the West Baden Spring hotel; the Sunken Garden at West Baden; horseback riding and pony rides for children; and the Indiana Railway Museum featuring over 65 18th century locomotives and coach cars.  The variety of attractions, golfing, gambling, dining, architecture and boundless historical significance to not only the resort grounds but in the two towns are hard to come by.

clueweb09-en0008-85-37761	"   Hotel Online  Special Releases       Elegance Returning To Midwest's Largest Resort    By Francine Silverman     The glory days of Indiana's two grandest resorts are definitely gone. When it opened in 1902,  West Baden Springs Hotel  was dubbed the Eighth Wonder of the World. Closed as a hotel in 1932 and unoccupied since 1983, the crumbling structure is undergoing a massive restoration, its fate unknown.     Tourists standing in the Pompeian Court under the massive glass-and-steel dome must think they're in a Greek ruin. ""This is probably Indiana's number one architectural landmark and it's going to be saved,"" declared my tour guide, Kent Abraham.     That remains to be seen. The owner, Historic Landmarks Foundation, is seeking a new user for the property. Cook Group, a Bloomington, Indiana-based medical technology company, is spending about $14 million to renovate a third of the facility. This is less than half of the estimated $40 million needed to restore the hotel and its 708 rooms to prime condition.     It's anyone's guess why  French Lick Springs Resort , a mile away, survived the Depression and its chief rival did not.     After all, these two fashionable spas had much in common. Both had mineral springs, believed to cure everything from cancer to alcoholism to constipation. French Lick's ""Pluto"" water was bottled nationally as ""America's Laxative,"" inspiring its motto, ""When Nature Won't, Pluto Will.""     These cold springs were mostly used for drinking - popularly called ""dipping and sipping,"" although in 1920 a ""Pluto Bath"" was advertised, at 50 cents. Of the seven springs in the area, all but one were eventually capped over. The survivor is at French Lick, bubbling under a gazebo behind the hotel and smelling as foul as a hot spring. Paula Mills, the activities director, recalls: ""As a child my father played in an orchestra here. I can remember Proserpine (spring), which was probably capped and covered with a brick patio sometime in the 1960s."" She also recounts that ""Paul Harvey used to spend a lot of time at French Lick"" and that he discovered the mineral water contains lithium. This led to his ""Rest of the Story,"" suggesting that health seekers were drugged into thinking they were cured.     Between 1887 and the 1950s, trains provided direct service to French Lick, at one point stopping there 14 times a day. Wealthy guests would spend their winters in Miami, summers in Mackinac Island in Michigan and the fall season at French Lick. They'd come to take the cure, some folks ingesting as many as 20 glasses a day. The laxative effect spawned several outhouses along the promenade, later replaced by the tennis courts. (Today's guests can bathe in the 22-mineral Pluto water in the health and fitness spa).     Both French Lick and West Baden were meccas for the gilded class - celebrities and mobsters alike. Between 1900 and World War I, it was common to see more than 100 private autos and Pullman cars parked on the sidings at both hotels. Photos in the basement at French Lick show Lana Turner signing an autograph on the front steps; Bing Crosby teeing up on the Hill course; George Jessel in the lobby; and Franklin D. Roosevelt in the ballroom accepting the presidential nomination in 1932. French Lick was also the spring training headquarters of the Chicago Cubs from 1879 to 1930. Between the 1920s and 1940s, the town boasted 12 gambling casinos and 20 hotels within a mile radius. Legend has it that Capone would arrive in a bulletproof car and gamble all night. He probably stayed at West Baden since he was refused entry at French Lick. ""Anybody who was anybody was at French Lick at one time or another,"" says G. Alan Barnett, president of the Indiana Railway Museum for 35 years and conductor of the French Lick, West Baden Railroad. ""This area never came back after the Depression.The hotel didn't close but the clientele would change dramatically.""     Sadly, the basement memorabilia contains the only early history of French Lick. Tom Taggart Jr., who took over in 1929 after his father died, and sold in 1946, destroyed all the records from almost half a century. ""I think for him the operation of the hotel became a real burden,"" says Mills. Despite his devotion to his employees, it was such a relief, she guesses. ""Most of what we have is from a 1952 thesis by Richard Haupt at Indiana University.""     We do know that the name French Lick originated in the 1700s when French fur traders observed livestock licking the mineral deposits found at the springs. Later on, American settlers built a fort in this ""Valley of the Seven Springs."" In 1845, physician William Bowles purchased the site and three mineral springs from the state of Indiana for $1.25 an acre. Eight years later, he opened the hotel and began selling ""Pluto"" water across the nation. (Two statues of these mythical gods of the lower world once guarded the springs from atop the old hotel entrance, but are now indoors).     The first French Lick hotel, a three-story frame structure, was destroyed by fire in 1897. In 1901, Tom J. Taggart, the former mayor of Indianapolis and Democratic boss, purchased the site. The West Baden Hotel had just burned to the ground and he didn't want to lose potential spa business. The present hotel, on 2600 acres, is an expanded and renovated version of Taggart's hotel.     Says Mills: ""During the Taggart years, the furnishings were replaced quite frequently. Taggart always had a very modern hotel."" The kitchen was self-sustaining, providing its own home-grown vegetables and milk products. A 1929 Christmas menu features barbequed opossum with southern candied yams and ice cream. (Tomato juice was first served and bottled in French Lick in 1917. A smokestack is all that's left of the factory).     Taggart's plan to create ""the grandest hotel in the midwest"" included a world class golf course, at a time when the sport was relatively new in the U.S. In 1907, he hired Scotsman Thomas Bendelow to build the 18-hole Valley Golf Link course. Six years later, he hired another Scotsman, Donald Ross, to design the championship Hill course two miles south of French Lick. Flat and treeless, the Valley course is used by the recreational golfer; the Hill course, set among rolling fairways and highbanked bunkers, is more challenging and professional. (Larry Bird, the town's favorite native son, plays there on a regular basis). ""We are the only full spa, golf and tennis resort and convention hotel in the midwest,"" boasts Michael Pitstick of Boykin Lodging Company, owners of the hotel since April 1997. ""Golf is our strongest attraction.""     It's Barnett's opinion that French Lick survived because it was Democratic and had lower rates, whereas West Baden attracted Republicans. ""Many of those people's wealth was on paper,"" he says. ""Ed (Ballard) closed it in the Depression. His business came to a screeching halt. Taggart managed to have the wherewithal to hold the thing together.""     Between 1954 and 1979, the property had several owners, including the Sheraton Hotel chain. In attempting to modernize it, they covered the front windows with wood, thereby blocking out sunlight, painted the brass white and hid the tile floors in the lobby under a carpet. ""I can remember as a child marble being taken to the local dump,"" Mills says with a shudder.     Fortunately, in recent years the owners have taken an interest in enhancing the nearly century-old hotel. In the next ten years, Boykin plans to spend $20 million to improve the landscape and pool area. It also plans to re-route traffic and increase maintenance and food/beverage personnel by 25 percent each. The Luther James Family of Louisville, which assumed ownership in 1981, spent $7 million for renovations. ""Luther James had three different decorators until he could finally find one,"" Mills recalls. ""They remodeled a floor at a time. Most of the guests weren't even aware they were remodeling.     ""The James family had planned to own it indefinitely,"" she adds, until it got an offer it couldn't refuse. ""I thought they were going to be our Taggarts. Apparently Boykin made them three different offers, raising the price each time.""     French Lick and its environs may not have the grandeur of old, but still holds a special place in the hearts of some. Barnett says he ""fell in love"" with the hotel years ago. Larry Bird, who has a home in town, ""grew up with a lot of the people who work in our resort"" and has his hair cut in the neighborhood, says Pitstick. When Bird was an NBA All-Star, a reporter asked how it felt to be home in Indianapolis. ""I ain't from here,"" Bird replied in disbelief. ""I'm from French Lick.""     -------------    French Lick is the largest, most complete four-season resort in the Midwest. It has 485 guest rooms,15 meeting and function rooms and nine restaurants and lounges. Sports facilities include two 18-hole golf courses, eight indoor and ten outdoor tennis courts, complete health spa, horseback riding, bowling, bicycling, shuffleboard and horseshoes. There are planned social activities and live entertainment.    -------------    Francine Silverman is a New York City-based freelance writer, specializing in profiles and travel.

After the discovery of rich mineral springs, which attracted animals that flocked to lick the waters and wet rocks, this valley became known among the settlers as “The Lick”.                    The French had ideas about exploiting these lush salt deposits, but because of one obstacle and another, not the least of which was relentless harassment by Indians, they never did make much progress. Finally, following the Louisiana Purchase Treaty in 1803, in which Napoleon relinquished claims on that part of the frontier, the French abandoned their trading posts at The Lick.                    British settlers moved in about 1812. Despite continued Indian resistance, they succeeded in establishing a permanent fort. Indian incidents continued, however. One of the first recorded was the slaying of Irishman William Charles, who was bushwhacked by Indians outside the fort. His remains are rumored to be buried somewhere beneath the front lawn of the resort.                    In 1832, all the lands surrounding the accrual mineral springs, which has been reserved for production of salt, was offered for public sale.                    About 1,500 acres – including all the large springs – were purchased by a Dr. William A. Bowles. Within several years he opened the first French Lick Springs Hotel, a ramshackle, three-story frame building. It was an immediate success. People flocked from hundreds of miles to partake of the “miracle waters”. They carried the mineral water away in all sorts of jugs and canvas containers. “Doc” Bowles had struck it rich.                    In the 1850’s, as North-South tension mounted, French Lick was a key station of the Negro slave “underground”. To counter this activity, Doc Bowles, who always had indicated sympathy for the Southern cause, helped organize a Confederate secret society, called Knights of the Golden Circle. In 1857, however, Bowles did take time out from his subversive activities to help charter the town of French Lick.                    Just before the Civil War, Bowles was arrested, courts-martial, convicted of treason and sentenced to death. President Lincoln, however, quietly commuted the sentence to life imprisonment. Bowles spent the war in a Federal prison in Ohio. He returned to French Lick in 1865 and managed the hotel until his death in 1873.                    French Lick Springs thrived under various managements with two more buildings being added in 1888. One building called the  Clifton  had additional rooms for guests while the other building was the  Pavilion , which was used for billiards, dancing and had a casino on the second floor. In 1897, the original building, now called the Windsor, burned. The owners were able to rebuild immediately. In 1901 the property was purchased by a syndicate which called itself the French Lick Springs Hotel Co. – headed by the then mayor of Indianapolis, Irish immigrant Thomas Taggart.                    It was under Taggart’s imaginative rule that French Lick Springs rocketed to international prominence. First he enlarged the east wing, using brick and marble. He had the Monon Railroad lay a special spur and run daily trains between Chicago and the front entrance of the hotel. He later designed a championship golf course (still later, a second). He modernized and expanded the baths and began bottling “Pluto Water” in concentrated form for national distribution. With an expansive and luxurious spa (and after Taggart had been named Democratic National Chairman in 1904), the elite of politics and society suddenly “discovered” French Lick Springs. It was at this hotel, too, in 1917 that tomato juice was first served by a world famous chef, Louis Perrin.                    Taggart insisted that the resort maintain a rigidly elegant dedication to health and recreation – although he himself was no teetotaler, he never permitted liquor on the premises. The first bar was not opened, in fact until after Repeal, some years following the old man’s demise. The wealthy celebrities who descended upon the little town in Indiana hills each spring and fall cane (1) to take “the cure”, (2) to play, (3) to conduct business and (4) to gamble.                    Taggart always disclaimed any connection with plush gambling casino throughout the valley. It never was however, officially explained how, in flagrant violation of state law, two big gambling rooms operated across the street from the hotel, perhaps half a dozen others catered to lesser hotel guests and common folk and, indeed at one time there was even a combination dice room and bowling alley right in the middle of the hotel’s own Japanese gardens, near the Pluto Spring. In any event, French Lick Springs was to become as well known for its resort facilities. The last casinos were shuttered in 1949. One of these buildings was taken over by the American Legion.                    Taggart, who served briefly as a U.S. Senator by appointment, had three more wings added to the hotel in the next 20 years. Taggart, who described himself as a hotelman first and a political hobbyist second, grew in stature until he was the acknowledged power behind Democratic politics in the U.S. Simultaneously, French Lick Springs developed a reputation as the unofficial party headquarters. It was there in Taggart’s hotel in 1931 that Franklin Roosevelt rounded up support at a Democratic governor’s conference for his party’s presidential nomination.                    Tom Taggart died in 1929. His son – the only boy among six children – Thomas D. Taggart, carried on. With the Depression, however, the popular French Lick Springs began to decline. World War II brought a momentary revival, but in 1946 your Tom Taggart sold out to a New York syndicate.                    Nearly a decade had passed when Sheraton Corporation acquired the colorful resort property in 1954. During the next twenty-five years, the Sheraton Corporation spent millions of dollars in restoring the famed spa to its former grandeur.                    In 1979, a group of investors, together with Cox Hotel Corporation of New York purchased the hotel. Kenwood Financial, of Washington D.C. was the owner from 1986 until 1991 and the hotel was managed by Buena Vista Hospitality Group of Florida.                    August 1991, the grand hotel was once again offered for sale. The Luther James family of Louisville, KY, purchased the hotel. The James family sold the property in 1997 to Boykin Lodging out of Cleveland, Ohio.                   On April 13, 2005 the French Lick Springs Resort was purchased by the Cook-Lauth Group, a newly formed group. The Cook-Lauth Group placed a bid with the Indiana Gaming Commission for the license to operate the Casino.                    Located on some 2,600 acres, the French Lick Springs Resort with its 525 rooms, boasts two superb golf courses, the Valley Course and the scenic, Donald Ross designed, Country Club Course. Badminton, volleyball, horseshoes, shuffleboard, croquet and water sports in two swimming pools (including a spacious bubble enclosed one) are other activities offered. Additionally, excellent horses, tennis courts, mineral baths and massages await the pleasure of guests.                    A rich colorful history included such famous names as John Barrymore, Clark Gable, Bing Crosby, President Roosevelt, the Truman’s, the Reagan’s and Joe and Rose Kennedy. All were honored guests at the French Lick Springs Resort and Spa. They walked the gardens and relaxed in the spa and enjoyed sitting on our wonderful veranda….and you can too.

It has Disneyland, however and  a variety of rooms and   prices that are generally a value compared to surrounding areas. You can   stay in surrounding areas and take a bus or drive to Disneyland.  A day   fee to park at Disneyland is now over $10 so you should factor that into the   price of a room elsewhere. As you can see on the map above, most of these   hotels are within walking distance or provide bus or shuttle service to the   theme park.                  One of the most difficult tasks in   picking a hotel room is seeing exactly where it is located in relationship   to the surrounding area.  Though this is only a small sampling of   Anaheim and Garden Grove hotels located near Disney theme parks, it may help   you gain perspective, on some of the properties nearby. Below are some web   pages for hotels listed here. Happy travels to the Happiest Place on Earth!   The are many surrounding cities featuring a large   variety of hotels and resorts. Some people like to stay at the beach nearby   and others prefer this freeway-close location Anaheim offers near the 5   Freeway to Los Angeles and San Diego. Whatever you choose, you will be able   to see how close the places are to Disneyland on this aerial photo above.
