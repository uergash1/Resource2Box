Two distinct systems for           pretreating wool/cotton fabrics, before dyeing them to union shades, were   investigated: the traditional (including low-and non-formaldehyde-          releasing) resins designed to impart durable press properties to cotton,    and certain commercial dye fixatives originally designed to increase        colorfastness in dyed cotton textiles.  Union shades with superior          colorfastness were found for a low-formaldehyde resin together with a       simple nitrogen-containing compound so that home laundering could be        prescribed.  As for the dye fixative systems, though union shades were      obtained there was limited color stability and this would require the ""dry  clean only"" label.  However, this limitation was overcome by using one      type of dye fixative, a cyanoguanidine, as the pretreatment to dyeing with  wool-reactive dyes.  The advantage to using dye fixative pretreatment       systems over resin systems is one of uniform application and processing     ease.  Resin systems require padding and baking and can lead to uneven      finishing of the fabric for uneven dye uptake.  Dye fixative systems, on    the other hand, allow simple and even application by immersing the fabric   in a solution bath at room temperature; subsequent dyeing leads to even     dye uptake.  The ability to dye wool/cotton to union shades with good       fastness properties will open new markets for comfortable, all-seasonal     apparel incorporating wool.  This will lead to a greater demand for wool    while adding greater value to cotton.

R-7 A-39 P-17  C. Identify basic methods of fabric construction. 1. Weaving (types of weaves) a. Plain weave (1) Defined: simplest and most common weave in which each weft/filling yarn passes successively over and under each warp yarn, alternating with each row. The result is a fabric that is strong and durable. The basket weave is a variation of the plain weave in which two or more yarns are passed successively over and under each other. (2) Fabric examples: broadcloth, chambray, chiffon, gingham, muslin, organdy, percale, poplin, sailcloth, seersucker, shantung, and taffeta. b. Twill weave (1) Defined: formed by passing a filling yarn over and under one, two, or three warp yarns, lapping back one warp yarn in each row. The twill weave creates diagonal ridges on the surface of the fabric called wales. The result is a very strong and durable fabric that is also wrinkle and soil resistant. Herringbone is a variation of a twill weave in which the direction of the ridge reverses itself. (2) Fabric examples: denim, gabardine, serge, surah, and ticking. c. Satin weave (1) Defined: characterized by long yarn floa ts on the surface of the fabric giving a smooth, lustrous appearance. (2) Fabric examples: sateen, satin. d. Variation weaves (1) Pile weave (a) Defined: formed by interlacing three sets of yarns with two sets forming the background and a third (cut or uncut) used to give a three-dimensional effect. Cut pile fabrics have a nap. (b) Fabric examples: corduroy, terrycloth, velvet and fake furs. (2) Dobby weave (a) Defined: uses an attachment that permits the weaving of geometric designs. (b) Fabric examples: fabrics with dots or geometric designs. (3) Jacquard weave (a) Defined: created when simple or complex designs are woven into the fabrics using a complicated type of loom.

(2) Fabric examples: double knits, interlock knits, jersey, ribbed knits, single knits, and sweater knits. b. Warp knits (1) Defined: made on flat knitting machines, with several yarns and needles. Loops are interlocking in the lengthwise direction. Warp knits have selvage edges and do not ravel. (2) Fabric examples : raschel knits and tricot. 3. Other forms of fabric construction a. Types (1) Nonwoven: a fabric in which textile fibers are compacted together using a combination of moisture, heat, chemicals, friction, and /or pressure. (2) Nets and laces : openwork fabrics made by knotting, twisting, or looping yarns. They can be constructed by hand or machine. (3) Braiding : process of interlacing three or more yarns to form a regular diagonal pattern down the length of the resulting cord. (4) Bonding : a method of permanently fastening together two layers of fabric by lamination. A chemical adhesive may be used or the layers may be fused with a web of fibers that melts when heat is applied. (5) Quilting : a layer of padding or batting is sandwiched between two layers and then held in place by machine stitching around decorative areas.

ARS  chemists Jeanette M. Cardamone and William N. Marmer have found a way to make cotton more chemically similar to its high-end counterpart—wool—so that a fabric blend of the two can be easily dyed.   Dyeing a cotton/wool blend is difficult because the two fibers have different chemical makeups. Wool, which is sheep hair, is made of animal proteins, while cotton is made of plant cellulose—the main part of a plant's cell wall. Normally, when wool and cotton are blended together, two separate dye baths are required because the wool takes up most of the dye.   ""The process we developed is a new single-bath dyeing procedure called union dyeing,"" says Cardamone. She and Marmer are with the Hides, Lipids, and Wool Research Unit at ARS' Eastern Regional Research Center (ERRC), in Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania. ""This process helps textile manufacturers overcome a major technological barrier: dyeing all-natural blends to the same depth of shade in one step.""             In the conventional procedure, Cardamone explains, cotton is dyed first and wool second. Wool is dyed in an acidic environment at high temperatures, and cotton is dyed in a nonacidic environment at lower temperatures. This difference requires that the wool and cotton be dyed either separately, or sequentially in one bath in which the pH and temperature levels are changed.  ""Our improved method uses pretreatments to make the cotton as receptive to dye uptake as the wool,"" she says.    Opposites Attract   Cardamone and Marmer's simple approach is to reverse the chemical charge of cotton from negative to positive before dyeing; wool is already positive. To do this, they use cationic fixatives—positively charged ions—which are typically used after cotton is dyed to help it keep its color. Applying the fixatives before dyeing gives both fiber components of the fabric a positive charge. Since the dye is negatively charged—and opposites attract—the cotton and wool dye to a uniform shade because the dye is attracted equally to both fibers. This union-dyeing process uses one dye in one bath, under one set of conditions.             Cotton industry officials are excited about the new process. ""This technology is easy to adopt,"" says John Turner, a senior chemist with Cotton Incorporated in Cary, North Carolina. ""It doesn't require elaborate equipment or expense. In the past, there was no satisfactory method for cotton mills to dye blends. This technology could potentially increase the use of cotton."" Cotton Incorporated wants to expand the use of cotton and make it more profitable for cotton farmers and the textile industry.  ""This process gives cotton an upscale market. A cotton/wool blend would have greater value than a 100-percent cotton item,"" Turner says. ""And depending on the blend level, it could be cleaned in the washing machine."" Cotton Incorporated has a research partnership with the ERRC scientists.     The wool industry also finds the concept appealing because it creates a new market for wool. Approximately 66,800 sheep producers raise 7.2 million sheep and lambs, producing about 49.2 million pounds of wool in the United States. Even so, the country still imports wool from Australia and New Zealand. This technology could help open more markets for American wool by increasing demand.                Keeping Colors Colorful     The ERRC scientists also use another method that helps make dyeing wool/cotton blends possible—a durable-press finishing resin. The resin treatment was originally developed by chemists at the ARS Southern Regional Research Center (SRRC) in New Orleans, Louisiana, to prevent wrinkling in 100-percent cotton. SRRC scientists further developed the technology to increase cotton's dyeability. SRRC chemist Eugene Blanchard collaborated with ERRC scientists on using the durable-press finishing resin treatment for cotton/wool blends.      Cardamone says resin treatments, which are alternatives to cationic fixatives, are important for good colorfastness in laundering. Colorfastness is a textile industry standard that determines how stable the color is in a garment. Good colorfastness means the garment won't fade after one washing. Resin pretreatment is best for garments that require excellent colorfastness. Cationic fixatives could be used for outerwear garments where colorfastness to washing is moderate but colorfastness to dry cleaning is high, notes Cardamone.   ""Both pretreatment systems will effectively lead to union-dyeing of wool/cotton blends, but the treatment should be selected to accommodate the anticipated end use. A wool/cotton-blend fabric is ideal for multiseason apparel because wool provides inherent resiliency and warmth while cotton contributes comfort and coolness,"" says Cardamone. ""These experimental textile treatments may broaden the market for cool-weather garments made of cotton/wool blends. In sweaters, for example, the blend's wool component retains body heat and imparts thickness, while cotton makes it comfortable to wear. Both natural fibers are great at wicking away moisture, too.""   Through a cooperative research and development agreement between ERRC researchers and chemical specialties manufacturer Hercules, Incorporated, other pretreatment systems are being investigated.   Applied commercially, these technologies may cut textile dyeing costs—savings that can be passed on to consumers seeking versatile garments for spring and fall.—By  Tara Weaver-Missick,  Agricultural Research Service Information Staff.

GX087-21-7235310	TEKTRAN   IMAGE ANALYSIS FOR DETECTING COLOR UNIFORMITY IN DYED TEXTILES      Author(s):    CARDAMONE  JEANETTE M              DAMERT  WILLIAM C                          Interpretive Summary:      Evenness or uniformity of color is subjective while quality of color in     terms of value, purity, and hue is objective through instrumental           (colorimetric) measurement.  Thus the textile industry is in need of an     objective measurement system for uniformity of color.  An image analysis    system configured with a TV camera, personal computer, and image analysis   hardware and software was used to capture and store the digital images of   dyed fabrics to analyze the fabrics for uniform coloration after dyeing.    The system was successfully tested on wool, cotton, and wool/cotton         blended fabrics that had been the object of research for chemically         imparting uniform coloration.

BioPreparation™ of Cotton Textiles:             A Cost Effective, Environmentally Compatible             Preparation Process            In textiles, the source of one of the most negative impacts on the            environment originates from traditional processes used to prepare cotton            fiber, yarn, and fabric. Fabric preparation consists of a series of            various treatments and rinsing steps critical to obtaining good results            in subsequent textile finishing processes. These water-intensive wet            processing steps generate large volumes of wastes, particularly from            alkaline scouring and continuous/batch dyeing. These wastes include            large amounts of salts, acids, and alkali. In view of the 40 billion            pounds of cotton fiber that are prepared annually on a global scale,            it becomes clear that the preparation process is a major source of environmentally            harsh chemical contribution to the environment.              Cotton wax, a natural component in the outer layer of cotton fibers,            is a major obstacle in processing textiles and must be removed to ""prepare""            the textile for dyeing and finishing. Conventional chemical preparation            processes involve treatment of the cotton substrate with hot solutions            of sodium hydroxide, chelating agents, and surface active agents, often            followed by a neutralization step with acetic acid. The scouring process            is designed to break down or release natural waxes, oils, and contaminants,            and emulsify or suspend these impurities in the scouring bath. Typically,            scouring wastes contribute high BOD loads during cotton textile preparation            (as much as 50%).             Novozymes' BioPreparation™ technology is an alternative to sodium            hydroxide that offers many advantages for textile wet processing, including            reduced BOD/COD and decreased water use. BioPreparation™ is an            enzymatic process for treating cotton textiles that meets the performance            characteristics of alkaline scour systems while reducing chemical and            effluent load. Pectate lyase is the main scouring agent that degrades            pectin to release the entangled waxes and other components from the            cotton surface. The enzyme is also compatible with other enzymatic preparations            (amylases, cellulases) used to improve the performance properties of            cotton fabrics.             The practical implications that BioPreparation™ technology has            on the textile industry are realized in terms of conservation of chemicals,            water, energy, and time. Based on field trials, textile mills may save            as much as 30 to 50% in water costs by replacing caustic scours or by            combining the usually separate scouring and dyeing steps into one. This            water savings results because BioPreparation™ uses fewer rinsing            steps than required during a traditional caustic scour. Significant            time savings were also demonstrated by combining treatment steps. A            recent statistical survey determined that 162 knitting mills typically            use 89 million m3/year of water in processing goods from scouring to            finishing; the BioPreparation™ approach would save from 27 to 45            million m3/year of water. In addition, field trials established that            BOD and COD loads are decreased by 25 and 40%, respectively, when compared            to conventional sodium hydroxide treatments. Furthermore, these conservation            measures translate directly into costs savings of 30% or more. As such,            this patented process provides an economical and environmentally friendly            alternative to alkaline scour systems currently used in the textile            industry today.

GX100-87-13770133	TEKTRAN   EFFECTIVE BIGUANIDE PRETREATMENTS FOR UNION DYEING WOOL/COTTON BLENDS      Author(s):    CARDAMONE  JEANETTE M              MARMER  WILLIAM N                  PHILLIPS  JOHN G                           Interpretive Summary:      There is difficulty in union dyeing (same color on wool and cotton) wool in the presence of cotton by an efficient and easy process because wool and    cotton require different types of dyes.  Wool and cotton blended textiles   were pretreated before dyeing with nitrogen-containing compounds having     similar chemical structures, and designed as commercial products to improve the dyeability of cotton.  After pretreatments, only the cotton in the      blend was modified and thus it dyed to the same color as wool in the same   dyebath.  Wool and cotton dyes proved effective for union dyeing after      these pretreatments.  The most effective and efficient conditions for       applying these compounds for union dyeing with wool dyes were by padding    the solution on with rollers and this could be done at lower concentrations than when the compounds were applied by leaving the fabrics in solutions    (exhaust).  One pretreatment compound provided antibacterial properties but was found to be not as versatile as the other compound for providing union  shades over a broad range of pretreatment concentrations when cotton dyes   were used.  Based on the colorfastness properties of the union dyed         wool/cotton fabrics, recommendations were made for use as outerwear with    labeling for dry-cleaning only.  This work established the lowest           pretreatment conditions for concentration, acidity/basicity, time, and      temperature of application.   Overall these compounds provided an expedient method for union dyeing by padding and by exhaust and the methods proved to be efficient, economical, and ecologically sound.  This will benefit the    textile industry and wool growers by opening a new market for wool.

ARS  chemists Jeanette M. Cardamone and William N. Marmer have found a way to make cotton more chemically similar to its high-end counterpart—wool—so that a fabric blend of the two can be easily dyed.   Dyeing a cotton/wool blend is difficult because the two fibers have different chemical makeups. Wool, which is sheep hair, is made of animal proteins, while cotton is made of plant cellulose—the main part of a plant's cell wall. Normally, when wool and cotton are blended together, two separate dye baths are required because the wool takes up most of the dye.   ""The process we developed is a new single-bath dyeing procedure called union dyeing,"" says Cardamone. She and Marmer are with the Hides, Lipids, and Wool Research Unit at ARS' Eastern Regional Research Center (ERRC), in Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania. ""This process helps textile manufacturers overcome a major technological barrier: dyeing all-natural blends to the same depth of shade in one step.""             In the conventional procedure, Cardamone explains, cotton is dyed first and wool second. Wool is dyed in an acidic environment at high temperatures, and cotton is dyed in a nonacidic environment at lower temperatures. This difference requires that the wool and cotton be dyed either separately, or sequentially in one bath in which the pH and temperature levels are changed.  ""Our improved method uses pretreatments to make the cotton as receptive to dye uptake as the wool,"" she says.    Opposites Attract   Cardamone and Marmer's simple approach is to reverse the chemical charge of cotton from negative to positive before dyeing; wool is already positive. To do this, they use cationic fixatives—positively charged ions—which are typically used after cotton is dyed to help it keep its color. Applying the fixatives before dyeing gives both fiber components of the fabric a positive charge. Since the dye is negatively charged—and opposites attract—the cotton and wool dye to a uniform shade because the dye is attracted equally to both fibers. This union-dyeing process uses one dye in one bath, under one set of conditions.             Cotton industry officials are excited about the new process. ""This technology is easy to adopt,"" says John Turner, a senior chemist with Cotton Incorporated in Cary, North Carolina. ""It doesn't require elaborate equipment or expense. In the past, there was no satisfactory method for cotton mills to dye blends. This technology could potentially increase the use of cotton."" Cotton Incorporated wants to expand the use of cotton and make it more profitable for cotton farmers and the textile industry.  ""This process gives cotton an upscale market. A cotton/wool blend would have greater value than a 100-percent cotton item,"" Turner says. ""And depending on the blend level, it could be cleaned in the washing machine."" Cotton Incorporated has a research partnership with the ERRC scientists.     The wool industry also finds the concept appealing because it creates a new market for wool. Approximately 66,800 sheep producers raise 7.2 million sheep and lambs, producing about 49.2 million pounds of wool in the United States. Even so, the country still imports wool from Australia and New Zealand. This technology could help open more markets for American wool by increasing demand.                Keeping Colors Colorful     The ERRC scientists also use another method that helps make dyeing wool/cotton blends possible—a durable-press finishing resin. The resin treatment was originally developed by chemists at the ARS Southern Regional Research Center (SRRC) in New Orleans, Louisiana, to prevent wrinkling in 100-percent cotton. SRRC scientists further developed the technology to increase cotton's dyeability. SRRC chemist Eugene Blanchard collaborated with ERRC scientists on using the durable-press finishing resin treatment for cotton/wool blends.      Cardamone says resin treatments, which are alternatives to cationic fixatives, are important for good colorfastness in laundering. Colorfastness is a textile industry standard that determines how stable the color is in a garment. Good colorfastness means the garment won't fade after one washing. Resin pretreatment is best for garments that require excellent colorfastness. Cationic fixatives could be used for outerwear garments where colorfastness to washing is moderate but colorfastness to dry cleaning is high, notes Cardamone.   ""Both pretreatment systems will effectively lead to union-dyeing of wool/cotton blends, but the treatment should be selected to accommodate the anticipated end use. A wool/cotton-blend fabric is ideal for multiseason apparel because wool provides inherent resiliency and warmth while cotton contributes comfort and coolness,"" says Cardamone. ""These experimental textile treatments may broaden the market for cool-weather garments made of cotton/wool blends. In sweaters, for example, the blend's wool component retains body heat and imparts thickness, while cotton makes it comfortable to wear. Both natural fibers are great at wicking away moisture, too.""   Through a cooperative research and development agreement between ERRC researchers and chemical specialties manufacturer Hercules, Incorporated, other pretreatment systems are being investigated.   Applied commercially, these technologies may cut textile dyeing costs—savings that can be passed on to consumers seeking versatile garments for spring and fall.—By  Tara Weaver-Missick,  Agricultural Research Service Information Staff.

ARS  chemists Jeanette M. Cardamone and William N. Marmer have found a way to make cotton more chemically similar to its high-end counterpart—wool—so that a fabric blend of the two can be easily dyed.   Dyeing a cotton/wool blend is difficult because the two fibers have different chemical makeups. Wool, which is sheep hair, is made of animal proteins, while cotton is made of plant cellulose—the main part of a plant's cell wall. Normally, when wool and cotton are blended together, two separate dye baths are required because the wool takes up most of the dye.   ""The process we developed is a new single-bath dyeing procedure called union dyeing,"" says Cardamone. She and Marmer are with the Hides, Lipids, and Wool Research Unit at ARS' Eastern Regional Research Center (ERRC), in Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania. ""This process helps textile manufacturers overcome a major technological barrier: dyeing all-natural blends to the same depth of shade in one step.""             In the conventional procedure, Cardamone explains, cotton is dyed first and wool second. Wool is dyed in an acidic environment at high temperatures, and cotton is dyed in a nonacidic environment at lower temperatures. This difference requires that the wool and cotton be dyed either separately, or sequentially in one bath in which the pH and temperature levels are changed.  ""Our improved method uses pretreatments to make the cotton as receptive to dye uptake as the wool,"" she says.    Opposites Attract   Cardamone and Marmer's simple approach is to reverse the chemical charge of cotton from negative to positive before dyeing; wool is already positive. To do this, they use cationic fixatives—positively charged ions—which are typically used after cotton is dyed to help it keep its color. Applying the fixatives before dyeing gives both fiber components of the fabric a positive charge. Since the dye is negatively charged—and opposites attract—the cotton and wool dye to a uniform shade because the dye is attracted equally to both fibers. This union-dyeing process uses one dye in one bath, under one set of conditions.             Cotton industry officials are excited about the new process. ""This technology is easy to adopt,"" says John Turner, a senior chemist with Cotton Incorporated in Cary, North Carolina. ""It doesn't require elaborate equipment or expense. In the past, there was no satisfactory method for cotton mills to dye blends. This technology could potentially increase the use of cotton."" Cotton Incorporated wants to expand the use of cotton and make it more profitable for cotton farmers and the textile industry.  ""This process gives cotton an upscale market. A cotton/wool blend would have greater value than a 100-percent cotton item,"" Turner says. ""And depending on the blend level, it could be cleaned in the washing machine."" Cotton Incorporated has a research partnership with the ERRC scientists.     The wool industry also finds the concept appealing because it creates a new market for wool. Approximately 66,800 sheep producers raise 7.2 million sheep and lambs, producing about 49.2 million pounds of wool in the United States. Even so, the country still imports wool from Australia and New Zealand. This technology could help open more markets for American wool by increasing demand.                Keeping Colors Colorful     The ERRC scientists also use another method that helps make dyeing wool/cotton blends possible—a durable-press finishing resin. The resin treatment was originally developed by chemists at the ARS Southern Regional Research Center (SRRC) in New Orleans, Louisiana, to prevent wrinkling in 100-percent cotton. SRRC scientists further developed the technology to increase cotton's dyeability. SRRC chemist Eugene Blanchard collaborated with ERRC scientists on using the durable-press finishing resin treatment for cotton/wool blends.      Cardamone says resin treatments, which are alternatives to cationic fixatives, are important for good colorfastness in laundering. Colorfastness is a textile industry standard that determines how stable the color is in a garment. Good colorfastness means the garment won't fade after one washing. Resin pretreatment is best for garments that require excellent colorfastness. Cationic fixatives could be used for outerwear garments where colorfastness to washing is moderate but colorfastness to dry cleaning is high, notes Cardamone.   ""Both pretreatment systems will effectively lead to union-dyeing of wool/cotton blends, but the treatment should be selected to accommodate the anticipated end use. A wool/cotton-blend fabric is ideal for multiseason apparel because wool provides inherent resiliency and warmth while cotton contributes comfort and coolness,"" says Cardamone. ""These experimental textile treatments may broaden the market for cool-weather garments made of cotton/wool blends. In sweaters, for example, the blend's wool component retains body heat and imparts thickness, while cotton makes it comfortable to wear. Both natural fibers are great at wicking away moisture, too.""   Through a cooperative research and development agreement between ERRC researchers and chemical specialties manufacturer Hercules, Incorporated, other pretreatment systems are being investigated.

Site Map              Search                                   Dyeing   Dyeing operations are used at various stages of production to add color and intricacy to textiles and increase product value. Most dyeing is performed either by the finishing division of vertically integrated textile companies, or by specialty dyehouses. Specialty dyehouses operate either on a commission basis or purchase greige goods and finish them before selling them to apparel and other product manufacturers. Textiles are dyed using a wide range of dyestuffs, techniques and equipment.   Dyes  used by the textile industry are largely synthetic, typically derived from coal tar and petroleum-based intermediates. Dyes are sold as powders, granules, pastes and liquid dispersions, with concentrations of active ingredients ranging typically from 20 to 80 percent.   Methods of Dyeing   Dyeing can be performed using continuous or batch processes. In batch dyeing, a certain amount of textile substrate, usually 100 to 1,000 kilograms, is loaded into a dyeing machine and brought to equilibrium, or near equilibrium, with a solution containing the dye. Because the dyes have an affinity for the fibers, the dye molecules leave the dye solution and enter the fibers over a period of minutes to hours, depending on the type of dye and fabric used. Auxiliary chemicals and controlled dyebath conditions (mainly temperature) accelerate and optimize the action. The dye is fixed in the fiber using heat and/or chemicals, and the tinted textile substrate is washed to remove unfixed dyes and chemicals. Common methods of batch, or exhaust, dyeing include beam, beck, jet and jig processing (see picture to the left). Pad dyeing can be performed by either batch or continuous processes.   In continuous dyeing processes, textiles are fed continuously into a dye range at speeds usually between 50 and 250 meters per minute. Continuous dyeing accounts for about 60 percent of total yardage of product dyed in the industry (Snowden-Swan, 1995). To be economical, this may require the dyer to process 10,000 meters of textiles or more per color, although specialty ranges are now being designed to run as little as 2,000 meters economically. Continuous dyeing processes typically consist of dye application, dye fixation with chemicals or heat, and washing.    Dye fixation is a measure of the amount of the percentage of dye in a bath that will fix to the fibers of the textile material. Dye fixation on the fiber occurs much more rapidly in continuous dying than in batch dyeing. Each dyeing process requires different amounts of dye per unit of fabric to be dyed. This is significant since color and salts in wastewater from spent dyes are often a pollution concern for textile facilities. In addition, less dye used results in energy conservation and chemical savings. The amounts of dye used depends on the dye exhausted from the dyebaths which determines the required dyebath ratio. The dyebath ratio is the ratio of the units of dye required per unit of fabric and typically ranges from 5 to 50 depending on the type of dye, dyeing system and affinity of the dyes for the fibers.   Dyeing processes may take place at any of several stages of the manufacturing process (fibers, yarn, piece-dyeing). Stock dyeing is used to dye fibers. Top dyeing is used to dye combed wool sliver. Yarn dyeing and piece dyeing is done after the yarn has been constructed into fabric.       Yarn Dyeing.  Yarn dyeing is used to create interesting checks,   stripes and plaids with different-colored yarns in the weaving process. In yarn dyeing, dyestuff penetrates the fibers in the core of the yarn. Some methods of yarn dyeing are stock,   package and skein dyeing. Stock dyeing dyes fiber using perforated tubes. In package dyeing, spools of yarn are stacked on perforated rods in a rack and immersed in a tank where dye is then forced outward from the rods under pressure. The dye is then pressured back through the packages toward the center to fully penetrate the entire yarn. Most carded and combed cotton used for knitted outerwear is package-dyed. In skein dyeing, yarn is loosely coiled on a reel and then dyed. The coils, or skeins, are hung over a rung and immersed in a dyebath (Corbman, 1975). Skein-dyed yarn is used for bulky acrylic and wool yarns. Typical capacity for package dyeing equipment is 1,210   lbs (550 kg) and for skein dyeing equipment is 220 lbs (100 kg).     Piece Dyeing.  Most dyed fabric is piece-dyed since this method gives the manufacturer maximum inventory flexibility to meet color demands as fashion changes. In terms of overall volume, the largest amount of dyeing is performed using beck and jig equipment (Figure 11). Beck dyeing is a versatile, continuous process used to dye long yards of fabric. About 1,980   lbs (900 kg) of fabric can be dyed on beck equipment at a time. The fabric is passed in rope form through the dyebath. The rope moves over a rail onto a reel which immerses it into the dye and then draws the fabric up and forward to the front of the machine. This process is repeated as long as necessary to dye the material uniformly to the desired color intensity. Jig dyeing uses the same procedure of beck   dyeing; however, the fabric is held on rollers at full width rather than in rope form as it is passed through the dyebath (Corbman, 1975). This reduces fabric tendency to crack or crease. Jig dyeing equipment can handle 550   lbs (250 kg) of fabric. Other piece dyeing methods include jet dyeing and pad dyeing. Fabric can be jet-dyed   [at up to 1,100 lbs (500 kg)] by placing it in a heated tube or column where jets of dye solution are forced through it at high pressures. The dye is continually recirculated as the fabric is moved along the tube. Pad dyeing, like jig dyeing, dyes the fabric at full width. The fabric is passed through a trough containing dye and then between two heavy rollers which force the dye into the cloth and squeeze out the excess (Corbman, 1975).

GX042-36-14259098	"TEKTRAN   PRETREATMENT OF WOOL/COTTON FOR UNION DYEING  PART 2: FIBER-REACTIVE QUATERNARY AMMONIUM COMPOUNDS      Author(s):    CARDAMONE  JEANETTE M              BAO  GUOPING                       MARMER  WILLIAM N                  DUDLEY  ROBERT L                   BULAN-BRADY  JANET                         Interpretive Summary:      There is recurrent interest in wool/cotton blended fabrics                  because they offer the consumer a luxurious product with the                unique and complementary properties of both fibers and because              these blends suggest apparel for all seasons.  The problems                 limiting the availability of such blends have been associated               with the difficulties in dyeing the two fiber components, having            different chemistries, to one shade.  We show that pretreating              wool/cotton with commercial dye fixatives before dyeing leads to            union (same color on wool and cotton) dyeing over a broad depth             of shades.  This system circumvents the cumbersome dyeing of wool           and cotton separately by one or two dyes in one or two dye baths.           After wet-pretreatment, the blend is dyed with one dye in one               bath.  Cotton then dyes similarly to wool by attraction of all              dye classes using conventional wool dyeing protocols.  For                  pretreated all-cotton fabrics, dye uptake is dramatically                   improved; without pretreatment, cotton is only stained.  All-wool           fabrics are only slightly affected.  Pretreated wool/cotton                 fabrics take up dye to the same depth of color as unpretreated              all-wool.  Colorfastness of the pretreated and dyed fabrics to              dry cleaning is excellent, but colorfastness to laundering is               poor.  Thus the care-label ""dryclean only"" is required.

GX058-83-11134193	"Publications     Issue List     Vote Analysis   Main Page     May 9, 2000         Highlights of the Conference Report  to Accompany H.R. 434, the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act               The Senate passed H.R. 434, the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, on November 3, 1999, by a vote of 79 to 19.  The House passed the conference report to H.R. 434 on May 4, 2000, by a vote of 309 to 110.    Noteworthy       The Senate may begin consideration of the conference report today.  It is expected that objection will be heard to waiving the reading of the report.     Senate Finance Chairman Roth has strongly endorsed the report despite his disappointment that it drops two Senate-passed provisions (1) closing two corporate tax shelters and (2) addressing the provision of AIDS drugs to countries in sub-Saharan Africa.     Titles in the Senate-passed bill reauthorizing Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) and the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) were dropped from the conference report but both were extended last year as part of the tax extenders package.     It is widely seen that passage of this first major piece of trade legislation in several years is a positive indication regarding Congressional action on the upcoming China Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) vote expected in the House later this month.     Highlights      The conference report to H.R. 434 authorizes new trade and investment policies for sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean by unilaterally expanding access to our markets.  Specifically, the measure creates a new trade preference program for the countries of sub-Saharan Africa.  The legislation also enhances a trade preference program already in place for the countries in the  Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) region.  The following are significant features of the conference report to H.R. 434:    African Growth and Opportunity Act      Extension of Trade Benefits to Sub-Saharan Africa.   The conference report amends the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program, Title V of the Trade Act of 1974, by inserting a new section 506A.     This new section authorizes the President to designate certain countries as beneficiary Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) countries eligible for certain enhanced benefits under the GSP program.  In order to be designated as a beneficiary SSA country, and therefore eligible for the benefits set forth in this section, a country must satisfy three criteria:      -- First, the president must find that the SSA country has established or is making continual progress toward establishing a market-based economy, a democratic society, and certain economic policies;     -- Second, the country must meet certain human rights and national security-related standards; and      -- Third, the country must satisfy the eligibility criteria for the GSP program.       Once a country is deemed an eligible beneficiary under this legislation, it will receive trade benefits in two general areas.  The first category covers apparel and a limited number of textile articles.  The second category includes other non-apparel items currently deemed ""import sensitive"" under the GSP program.       Treatment of Textile and Apparel Items.    The conference report provides beneficiary SSA countries (as designated under the new section 506A of the Trade Act of 1974) with duty-free and quota-free access to the U.S. market for certain textiles and apparel products, as well as for a limited number of textiles.  These benefits are contingent on a country's satisfying the eligibility criteria described above, as well as certain provisions designed to curb the illegal transshipment of textile and apparel products.  Once a country satisfies these requirements, duty-free and quota-free benefits will be extended to:      -- Apparel articles assembled in beneficiary SSA countries from U.S. fabric made with U.S. yarn.     -- Apparel made in Africa from regional fabric made with regional yarn, up to a certain cap.  This cap on duty-free treatment begins in the first year at 1.5 percent of total apparel imports coming into the United States (currently, the sub-Saharan countries account for less than 1 percent of all such imports) and increases in even increments over the eight-year life of the bill to reach a limit of 3 percent.  Included within this cap, duty-free and quota-free benefits for four years to apparel made in Africa from third country fabric by any ""least developed"" African country (defined as a country with a per capita GNP below $1,500).  For trade above the cap amount, normal trade relations (NTR) duty rates would apply, as they do to imports from all other countries, other than our free trade partners (i.e., Mexico, Canada, and Israel).     -- Knit-to-shape sweaters made from third-country yarns not available in the United States (including silk and cashmere); provisions also create a process to include additional non-available items.  These benefits also extend to knit-to-shape sweaters made from merino wool.      Additionally, the conference report mandates the following:      -- Requires the lifting of all existing quotas on textile and apparel products from Africa.     -- Establishes a surge mechanism whereby duties may be ""snapped back"" to non-preferential levels if an apparel article qualifying for benefits is being imported in such increased quantities as to cause serious damage or the threat of such damage to the U.S. industry producing the like or directly competitive article.  The legislation directs the President to monitor imports from Africa to detect if such surges are occurring, and to initiate investigations to determine whether such surges are injurious to the domestic industry.       Beneficiary country participation requirements.   The legislation establishes stringent provisions intended to curb the risk of illegal transshipment of textile and apparel products through sub-Saharan Africa.  Specifically, in order to receive the benefits provided in the bill, a beneficiary SSA country must (1) adopt an effective and efficient visa system to guard against unlawful transshipment of textile and apparel products and the use of counterfeit documents; and (2) enact legislation or regulations that would permit the U.S. Customs Service to investigate thoroughly allegations of transshipment through such country.  The conference report authorizes $5.9 million in additional funding for transshipment enforcement to ensure that Customs has the resources necessary to provide technical assistance to beneficiary SSA countries.  The legislation also directs the Customs Service to provide technical assistance to the sub-Saharan African countries to assist them with combating illegal transshipment.      Products Other than Textiles and Apparel.   The conference report extends duty-free treatment under the GSP program to certain products currently deemed ""import sensitive"" and therefore not covered by duty-free benefits under the GSP program.  These products include certain watches, electronic articles, steel products, footwear, handbags, luggage, and glass products, among others.      U.S.-SSA Free Trade Forum.   The conference report directs the president to establish a United States-SSA Trade and Economic Cooperation Forum with interested SSA countries.  The purpose of this Forum is to foster close economic ties between the United States and SSA by encouraging meetings between private sector, governmental, and nongovernmental leaders to discuss expanding trade and investment relations between the United States and SSA.  This provision also directs the president to meet with the heads of the governments of interested SSA countries for the purpose of discussing expanding trade and investment relations between the United States and the SSA countries.      Negotiations Toward Free-Trade Agreement.   The conference report directs the president to examine the feasibility of negotiating a free-trade agreement with interested SSA countries.  If the president finds that such an agreement is feasible, then the president must provide a detailed plan for such negotiations that outlines the objectives, timing, potential benefits to the United States and SSA countries, and likely economic impact of any such agreement.      HIV/AIDS.   The conference report expresses the sense of the Congress that U.S. businesses should be encouraged to provide assistance to sub-Saharan Africa to prevent and reduce the incidence of HIV/AIDS, including use of a Response Fund to coordinate the collection and distribution of assistance.     NOTE:  Regarding this provision, Finance Committee Chairman Roth stated on May 3, 2000:  ""I would also like to note my disappointment that we were unable to agree on a way to address the issue of providing AIDS drugs for Africa.  But I would also note that other committees are working to address this issue, allowing Congress the opportunity to take an active role in ensuring that the United States makes a significant contribution to combating the AIDS crisis.""      Economic Development.   The conference report includes additional sense of Congress provisions expressing support for programs, most of which have already been initiated, designed to spur exports to and investment in sub-Saharan Africa.  Specifically, the conference report expresses support to initiatives undertaken by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the Export-Import Bank, and the U.S. Department of Commerce's Foreign Commercial Service.       U.S.-Caribbean Basin Trade Enhancement     Enhanced CBI Program.   The conference report preserves the United States' commitment to Caribbean Basin beneficiary countries by promoting the growth of free enterprise and economic opportunity in these neighboring countries.  Trade benefits established through the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act enacted in 1984 are extended through 2008.       Apparel and Textiles.    Duty-free and quota-free treatment are immediately extended to:      -- Apparel articles made in the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) region from U.S. fabric made with U.S. yarn.       -- Knit apparel made in the Caribbean Basin from regional knit fabric made with U.S. yarn and knit-to-shape apparel (except socks), up to a cap of 250 million square meter equivalents, with a growth rate of 16 percent per year for the first three years; provisions extend the benefits for outerwear t-shirts knit in the CBI region up to a separate cap of 4.2 million dozen each year, growing 16 percent per year for the first three years.     -- Benefits for products other than textiles and apparel.  The conference report extends NAFTA tariff rates for imports of certain products currently excluded from the CBI program, including certain footwear, tuna, petroleum, and watches.        Extension of Benefits.   The enhanced benefits under the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act are conditioned on countries continuing to meet conditions of the current CBI program, as well on as the additional eligibility criteria set forth in the conference report.  These additional criteria includ e  intellectual property protection, investment protection, improved market access for U.S. exports, and whether the country is taking steps to afford internationally recognized workers' rights.         Transshipment Protections.   The conference report requires that eligible countries implement strict and effective customs procedures to guard against transshipment.  Under a ""one strike and you are out"" provision, if an exporter is determined to have engaged in the illegal transshipment of textile and apparel products from a CBI country, the president is required to deny all benefits under the bill to that exporter for a period of two years.  Those guilty of transshipment violations are subject to treble charges to existing textile and apparel quotas.      Other provisions.   The conference report requires countries to implement their commitment to eliminate the worst forms of child labor in order to receive benefits; requires the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) to periodically change products on any Section 301 retaliation list, in whole or in part, unless a settlement is imminent or petitioners agree not to change the list; extends permanent normal trade relations status to Kyrgyzstan and Albania; clarifies that Section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 bans imports of products made with forced or indentured child labor; establishes provisions to rectify tariff inversion on imports of fine wool fabric; and establishes a permanent agricultural ambassador within the USTR.

GX054-55-6972349	"*EPF414   05/11/00  Text: Senate Committee Summary of Africa-Caribbean Trade Bill  (Senate passed bill in 77-19 vote) (2800)    Following is the text of the Senate Finance Committee press release summarizing the Africa-Caribbean trade bill, which the Senate passed 77-19 May 11:    (begin text)     SUMMARY OF THE TRADE AND DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2000 CONFERENCE REPORT  including THE AFRICA GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY ACT; THE CARIBBEAN BASIN TRADE PARTNERSHIP ACT; AND OTHER TRADE MEASURES    WASHINGTON -- The Trade and Development Act of 2000 contains the conference agreement on the African Growth and Opportunity Act, the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act, and miscellaneous other trade measures that were passed as part of the Senate's consideration of the legislation in November, 1999.  On May 4, the House passed the conference agreement by a vote of 309-110.  Passage of the conference agreement by the Senate would send the first significant trade legislation to pass both Houses of Congress since 1988, other than the implementation of trade agreements under special procedures, to the President for his signature.    The following discussion provides an overview of the conference agreement by title.    Title I -- Extension of Certain Trade Benefits to Sub-Saharan Africa Title I incorporates the conferee's agreement on the benefits available under the African Growth and Opportunity Act.  To obtain the benefits of Title I, a potential beneficiary must be listed among the 48 African countries identified in the bill and meet certain eligibility requirements.    The eligibility requirements include, as a first step, satisfaction of the basic eligibility criteria of the U.S.  Generalized System of Preferences (""GSP""), which applies to all developing countries and includes basic commitments to foster open trade, avoid certain acts that discourage investment, and take appropriate steps to afford internationally recognized worker rights.  The conference agreement would add one additional item to the GSP eligibility requirements -- the Harkin-Helms Amendment -- that would also require that beneficiary countries to fulfill their international commitments to eliminate the worst forms of child labor, such as slavery, indentured servitude and child prostitution.  The Harkin-Helms Amendment would apply to all GSP beneficiary countries, not to Africa alone.    In addition to the GSP criteria, Title I would require the President to determine that the beneficiary countries were meeting certain eligibility criteria that were specific to Africa.  Those include promotion of market economies, democratic societies, and open trading system, economic policies to reduce poverty, and a system to combat corruption and bribery.  The President would be obliged to monitor the beneficiary countries' progress on these criteria on an annual basis, as he does with all developing countries participating in other U.S.  programs, like GSP, the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (""CBERA""), or the Andean Trade Preferences Act.    Title I would authorize U.S. participation in a United States-Sub-Saharan Africa Trade and Economic Cooperation Forum to foster the goals set out in the conference agreement.  The conference agreement calls for annual meetings of the Forum, in cooperation with non-governmental organizations and in consultation with Congress.  As part of the expected ongoing consultation with Congress, the conference agreement requires periodic reports from the President regarding the achievement of the conference agreement's objectives.    Title I would extend the following trade benefits to eligible Sub-Saharan Africa beneficiary countries.  The conference agreement would eliminate existing quotas applied under the Uruguay Round Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (which applied only to Kenya and South Africa and generally went unfilled).  Title I would extend duty-free and quota-free treatment to all apparel products made in a beneficiary country using American fabric, yarn and thread.  Title I would then add similar benefits for apparel made from fabric made in the Sub-Saharan African region over the life of the bill (8 years) up to a set percentage of overall apparel imports into the United States.  That figure would start at 1.5 percent of U.S.  apparel imports in the first year of the program, then rise to 3.5 percent of U.S.  apparel imports by the final year.    For the least developed countries, Title I would extend the same duty-free and quota-free treatment to their apparel exports to the United States, subject to the same conditions, but authorize their use, for a period of 4 years, of fabric formed in third countries.  The added benefits are intended to give the least developed countries (defined here as those with annual per capita gross domestic product of $1500 or less) in order to allow them a head start in developing the infrastructure necessary to produce for world markets.    Title I would create certain exceptions to the rules of origin set out above in the case of fabrics not made in the United States and a general de minimis exception that would permit the use of limited amounts of fabric originating in third countries (up to 7 percent by value) of apparel items to which the rules would otherwise apply.  Title I would also create exceptions to those rules of origin that would permit the use of third country-origin items in the manufacture of certain undergarments and with respect to findings and trimmings.    Title I would also extend duty-free treatment to other articles previously excluded from the Generalized System of Preferences, including petroleum, watches, certain electronic and steel articles, footwear, handbags, flat goods, and glass products, among others.    To protect against customs fraud designed to gain access to the program illegally (commonly referred to as ""transshipment""), the conference agreement contains unprecedented protections.  They include requirements that the beneficiary countries develop their own effective infrastructure, with U.S. technical assistance, to combat transshipment and cooperate fully with the U.S.    Customs Service in its investigation of alleged customs fraud.  In addition, with respect to any individual exporter found fraudulently to have claimed the trade benefits extended under the conference agreement, Title I would expel the exporter from eligibility for the program's benefits for a period of 5 years.    Title I would also authorize the appropriation of funds necessary to improve the U.S. Customs Service's investigation of transshipment generally, in order to contribute to the success of the program's benefits.    In addition, Title I would provide a mechanism by which domestic producers of apparel articles competing with those imported under Title I from Sub-Saharan Africa (or manufacturers of the U.S. fabric inputs into such apparel articles) would petition for relief from surges in imports in particular categories that threaten serious injury to the domestic industry producing the apparel article in question.  Under those provisions, the tariffs could be reimposed in limited instances in which a domestic producer could establish a meritorious case.    Title I of the conference agreement would add certain other provisions the conferees believed necessary to the success of the program established under the African Growth and Opportunity Act.  Those include -- (1) encouraging the negotiation of trade-liberalizing agreements with interested Sub-Saharan Africa trading partners, (2) the permanent establishment of an Assistant United States Trade Representative for African Affairs, (3) a sense of the Congress resolution regarding the need for comprehensive debt relief for the world's poorest countries (most of which are in Sub-Saharan Africa), (4) targeting of U.S. technical assistance to foster the goals of the conference agreement with respect to Sub-Saharan Africa, (5) encouraging the development of a special equity fund for fostering investment in Africa at the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation, (6) directing the expansion of U.S. Commerce Department initiatives designed to foster the development of African markets for U.S. exports, (7) the donation of air traffic control equipment no longer in use in the United States to eligible Sub-Saharan Africa countries, (8) a sense of the Congress relating to efforts to combat desertification, and (9) authorization of a study regarding potential improvements in Sub-Saharan agricultural practices.    In addition, Title I contains two provisions that represent a step, but only a first step, toward the development of a comprehensive U.S. strategy to assist Sub-Saharan African countries combat the scourge of AIDS.  The two provisions express the sense of Congress that the combat of AIDS in affected Sub-Saharan Africa countries should form a central element of U.S. foreign policy in the region and that every effort should be made to encourage U.S. businesses to provide assistance to Sub-Saharan Africa countries to prevent and reduce the incidence of AIDS, including the establishment of an HIV/AIDS Response Fund to provide for coordination of public and private sector efforts.    Title II -- Trade Benefits for the Caribbean Basin Title II incorporates the conference agreement on the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act, which is an expansion of the benefits of what is commonly referred to as the Caribbean Basin Initiative or ""CBI."" The structure of Title II is much like that of Title I -- Title II establishes basic findings concerning the need to restore the margin of preference CBI countries enjoyed prior to the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (""NAFTA""), as well as to improve economic opportunities, foster the CBI beneficiary countries participation in both existing and proposed trade arrangements in the region, and to foster economic development in light of the devastation wrought in the region by multiple natural disasters in recent years.    As was true of Title I, Title II is subject to the Harkin-Helms Amendment which would add to the list of existing eligibility criteria for participation in the CBI program a requirement that the beneficiary countries have fulfilled their obligation to implement their international commitments with respect to the worst forms of child labor.  As noted above, those include slavery, indentured servitude and child prostitution.    The original Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act excluded certain products as did the GSP.  Title II of the conference agreement would now extend duty-free treatment to such articles subject to the special rules affecting textiles and apparel described below.  With respect to textiles and apparel, Title II would provide duty-free and quota-free access to the U.S. market for apparel made with U.S. fabric, yarn and thread.  Title II would also authorize duty-free and quota free access to certain apparel items made from fabric knit in the CBI region subject to an initial annual limit of 250 million square meter equivalents for knit apparel items other than outerwear t-shirts and an initial annual limit of 4.2 million dozen outerwear t-shirts.  Both limits would be subject of a growth rate of 16 percent compounded annually through the first three years following the first year of the program.    Title I would apply certain exceptions and exemptions akin to those set out above with respect to Title I.  Those include exceptions regarding the use of a de minimis amount of fabric originating in a third country, with the exception of certain fabrics made from elastomeric yarns, as well as exemptions for the use of fabric and other components in the manufacture of certain undergarments and for use as findings and trimmings on apparel.    Title II contains provisions designed to combat illegal transshipment equivalent to those contained in Title I with respect to Sub-Saharan Africa.  Title II also contains a safeguard mechanism that could lead to the reimposition of tariffs on items that cause serious damage to the domestic producers of competing products in the United States.    As did Title I, Title II incorporates certain other provisions that the conferees determined would be helpful in fostering stronger trading links with the CBI region.  Those include (1) providing duty-free treatment to certain beverages made with Caribbean rum and (2) encouraging annual meetings between the United States Trade Representative and trade ministers from beneficiary countries in the CBI region with a view toward initiating trade liberalizing negotiations with interested beneficiary countries.    Title III -- Normal Trade Relations for Albania and Kyrgyzstan The Senate-passed legislation that led to the Trade and Development Act of 200) contained provisions extending normal trade relations status to Albania and Kyrgyzstan.  Both have acceded to the World Trade Organization, as a result of which the United States is obliged, under the terms of its own participation in the WTO, to extend normal trade relations status under U.S. law.  That involves excluding them from the ambit of the Jackson-Vanik amendment which applies to former member states of the Soviet Union.    The conferees took special note that the freedom of emigration provisions of the Jackson-Vanik amendment were met in the case of Kyrgyzstan, the first of the former Soviet republics to graduate from coverage of the amendment.  The conferees underscored that they will apply a similar scrutiny to all other successor states to the Soviet Union in consideration of their exemption from the ambit of the Jackson-Vanik amendment.    Title IV -- Other Trade Provisions Title Iv of the Trade and Development Act of 2000 contains a number of miscellaneous trade provisions.  They include the following items:     -- directions to the General Accounting Office (""GAO"") to prepare a report on the effectiveness of current trade adjustment assistance (""TAA"") programs and other federal and state job training programs;    -- provision of TAA benefits workers that were previously certified for such benefits in connection with the retirement of certain nuclear power facilities in Oregon;    reliquidation at zero rate of duty of certain nuclear fuel rod assemblies;    requirements that certain trade-related reports provided for under section 607 of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Appropriations Act, 1999, the International Financial Institutions Act, and section 629 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 1999, be forwarded to the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means Committees;    -- implementation of rules of origin applicable to imports of certain flat goods made from silk, cotton, man-made and vegetable fibers in order to implement an agreement reached with the European Union resolving a prior dispute regarding such rules of origin;    establishment of a permanent chief agriculture negotiator in the Office of the United States Trade Representative;    -- requirements that the USTR regularly rotate products identified on any list of goods subject to retaliatory sanctions resulting from a trade dispute;    -- requirement that the Secretary of Labor, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture, report efficacy of current TAA programs as they apply to American farmers and provide recommendations on means by which such programs might be improved in order to effect their original intent that farmers be covered;    -- directions to the U.S.  Customs Service to provide for weekly entry of merchandise produced in foreign trade zones to effect the intent of Congress as previously expressed in the Customs Modernization Act, which passed as part of the NAFTA implementing legislation in 1993; and    -- clarification that section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930, which authorizes the Customs Service to deny entry to imports manufactured with forced or indentured labor, includes forced or indentured child labor within its existing scope.    The final provision of Title IV contains the conference agreement regarding the Harkin-Helms Amendment discussed above with respect to the benefits extended under Titles I and II of the conference agreement, as well as under the existing GSP program.    Title V -- Imports of Certain Wool Articles Title V would, consistent with the policy statement on tariff inversions contained in the Senate bill, reduce the impact of certain tariff inversions affecting the manufacture of certain apparel from worsted wool fabric.  Title V would reduce tariffs on imports of worsted wool fabric, certain worsted wool yarn, and fiber beginning January 1, 2000, for a period of three years.  In addition, Title V would also allow for the refund of duties currently paid on such items based on amounts imported of those items by individual producers of the identified apparel items, the fabric, and the yarn during calendar year 1999.  Title V would direct the creation of a fund for research and market development regarding production of improved wool fiber in the United States.    Title VI -- Revenue Provisions Title VI of the conference agreement would include two revenue provisions.  The first would authorize the President to waive the application of section 901(j) of the Internal Revenue Code which denies foreign tax credit treatment to taxes paid to the local government on income earned in certain countries previously identified as supporters of international terrorism.  The President's waiver authority is subject to two conditions -- (1) the President must determine that such waiver is in the national interest of the United States and that it will expand trade opportunities for U.S. companies in such countries and (2) the President must report to the Congress not less than 30 days before granting the waiver, setting out his reasons for granting the waiver.    The second revenue provision would accelerate the rum excise tax cover overpayments to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands currently provided under section 7652 of the Internal Revenue Code, subject to certain clarifications as to the conditions that apply to such payments.

GX009-03-2575320	TEKTRAN   A NOVEL TECHNIQUE FOR EVALUATING QUALITY OF A COTTON FIBER, YARN AND FABRIC      Author(s):    SAWHNEY  AMAR P                            Interpretive Summary:      Evaluation of cotton fabrics for quality determination/control and for      marketing is important.  However, there is no well established single       process or test method which can show a true picture of the fabric's        detailed physical appearance, clearly indicating the various forms of       fiber, yarn, and fabric defects simultaneously.  The appearance,            especially of a non-technical, cotton or cotton-blend fabric is a very      important factor in determining the fabric's overall quality.  A novel      technique of electronic printing/dyeing of only face of a swatch of         fabric on a computer has been developed.  Because of the extremely          uniform dispersing of ink with the computer accuracy, this new              technique allows to see on the other side of the fabric a very clear        picture of the fabric surface and, hence, overall quality.  By              pronouncedly highlighting almost all the different types of common          defects of the fiber, yarn, and fabric simultaneously, the other,           undyed side of the fabric indeed tells the whole story about the            fabric's overall aesthetic quality.  Subjective examination or              objective evaluations of this side of the fabric sample can be used to      grade or compare the fabric, both quantitatively and qualitatively.         The test method is a new tool to inspect, examine, compare, and             evaluate cotton textiles.  This information will benefit the cotton         textile industry.

They can be produced also by treating cotton with non-formaldehyde polycarboxylic crosslinking agents.  In either case the finished fabrics    are not dyeable with dyes normally used to dye cotton.  However, by         treatment of cotton with specific reactive nitrogenous compounds in         conjunction with crosslinking agents, fabrics are produced that are both    smooth drying and dyeable with several classes of dyes, including some that are not even useful for dyeing untreated cotton.  These processes have      application in the garment dyeing industry, whereby fabrics are dyed after  they have been fabricated into garments.  No such fabric as described is    commercially available.  Presently, only  untreated cotton garments, which  do not have smooth drying properties after processing, are dyed.  This      report provides information of value to textile finishers, researchers,     garment manufacturers, and to those engaged in the dyeing of textiles.

ACTION: Notice of exception to regulations (40 CFR Part 72).     SUMMARY: Title IV of the Clean Air Act authorizes the Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA) to establish the Acid Rain Program. During  Phase I (1995-1999) of the program, units subject to sulfur dioxide  emissions limitations are required to account for any emissions  resulting from reduced utilization of the units and shifting of  electric generation from the units to other units or generators. Each  unit is included in a dispatch system, and the accounting for reduced  utilization is conducted on a dispatch-system basis. Under  Sec. 72.33(b), a unit may submit an identification of dispatch system,  i.e., a request to establish a given group of units as a dispatch  system. The regulation requires the submission to be made by January 30  of the first year for which the dispatch system is to be used for  reduced utilization accounting.      The Agency hereby gives notice that on May 3, 1995, Midwest Power  System, Inc. submitted an identification of dispatch system to take  effect starting in 1995 and a request for an exception to the January  30 submission deadline. By letter dated May 31, 1995, the Agency  granted the request and accepted the identification of dispatch system.  The May 31, 1995 letter sets forth the basis for granting the request.

GX048-93-6564999	"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    Press Release #106 - 375    May 9, 2000            seven pages total     SUMMARY OF     THE TRADE AND DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2000 CONFERENCE REPORT     including    THE AFRICA GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY ACT;    THE CARIBBEAN BASIN TRADE PARTNERSHIP ACT; AND     OTHER TRADE MEASURES      WASHINGTON - The Trade and Development Act of 2000 contains the conference agreement on the African Growth and Opportunity Act, the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act, and miscellaneous other trade measures that were passed as part of the Senate's consideration of the legislation in November, 1999.  On May 4, the House passed the conference agreement by a vote of 309-110.  Passage of the conference agreement by the Senate would send the first significant trade legislation to pass both Houses of Congress since 1988, other than the implementation of trade agreements under special procedures, to the President for his signature.       The following discussion provides an overview of the conference agreement by title.     Title I -- Extension of Certain Trade Benefits to Sub-Saharan Africa      Title I incorporates the conferee's agreement on the benefits available under the African Growth and Opportunity Act.  To obtain the benefits of Title I, a potential beneficiary must be listed among the 48 African countries identified in the bill and meet certain eligibility requirements.      The eligibility requirements include, as a first step, satisfaction of the basic eligibility criteria of the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences (""GSP""), which applies to all developing countries and includes basic commitments to foster open trade, avoid certain acts that discourage investment, and take appropriate steps to afford internationally recognized worker rights.  The conference agreement would add one additional item to the GSP eligibility requirements --  the Harkin-Helms Amendment -- that would also require that beneficiary countries to fulfill their international commitments to eliminate the worst forms of child labor, such as slavery, indentured servitude and child prostitution.  The Harkin-Helms Amendment would apply to all GSP beneficiary countries, not to Africa alone.      In addition to the GSP criteria, Title I would require the President to determine that the beneficiary countries were meeting certain eligibility criteria that were specific to Africa.  Those include promotion of market economies, democratic societies, and open trading system, economic policies to reduce poverty, and a system to combat corruption and bribery.  The President would be obliged to monitor the beneficiary countries' progress on these criteria on an annual basis, as he does with all developing countries participating in other U.S. programs, like GSP, the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (""CBERA""), or the Andean Trade Preferences Act.      Title I would authorize U.S. participation in a United States-Sub-Saharan Africa Trade and Economic Cooperation Forum to foster the goals set out in the conference agreement.  The conference agreement calls for annual meetings of the Forum, in cooperation with non-governmental organizations and in consultation with Congress.  As part of the expected ongoing consultation with Congress, the conference agreement requires periodic reports from the President regarding the achievement of the conference agreement's objectives.      Title I would extend the following trade benefits to eligible Sub-Saharan Africa beneficiary countries.  The conference agreement would eliminate existing quotas applied under the Uruguay Round Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (which applied only to Kenya and South Africa and generally went unfilled).  Title I would extend duty-free and quota-free treatment to all apparel products made in a beneficiary country using American fabric, yarn and thread.  Title I would then add similar benefits for apparel made from fabric made in the Sub-Saharan African region over the life of the bill (8 years) up to a set percentage of overall apparel imports into the United States.  That figure would start at 1.5 percent of U.S. apparel imports in the first year of the program, then rise to 3.5 percent of U.S. apparel imports by the final year.      For the least developed countries, Title I would extend  the same duty-free and quota-free treatment to their apparel exports to the United States, subject to the same conditions, but authorize their use, for a period of 4 years, of fabric formed in third countries.  The added benefits are intended to give the least developed countries (defined here as those with annual per capita gross domestic product of $1500 or less)  in order to allow them a head start in developing the infrastructure necessary to produce for world markets.      Title I would create certain exceptions to the rules of origin set out above in the case of fabrics not made in the United States and a general de minis exception that would permit the use of limited amounts of fabric originating in third countries (up to 7 percent by value) of apparel items to which the rules would otherwise apply.  Title I would also create exceptions to those rules of origin that would permit the use of third country-origin items in the manufacture of certain undergarments and with respect to findings and trimmings.      Title I would also extend duty-free treatment to other articles previously excluded from the Generalized System of Preferences, including petroleum, watches, certain electronic and steel articles, footwear, handbags, flat goods, and glass products, among others.      To protect against customs fraud designed to gain access to the program illegally (commonly referred to as ""transshipment""), the conference agreement contains unprecedented protections.   They include requirements that the beneficiary countries develop their own effective infrastructure, with U.S. technical assistance, to combat transshipment and cooperate fully with the U.S. Customs Service in its investigation of alleged customs fraud.  In addition, with respect to any individual exporter found fraudulently to have claimed the trade benefits extended under the conference agreement, Title I would expel the exporter from eligibility for the program's benefits for a period of 5 years.  Title I would also authorize the appropriation of funds necessary to improve the U.S. Customs Service's investigation of transshipment generally, in order to contribute to the success of the program's benefits.      In addition, Title I would provide a mechanism by which domestic producers of apparel articles competing with those imported under Title I from Sub-Saharan Africa (or manufacturers of the U.S. fabric inputs into such apparel articles) would petition for relief from surges in imports in particular categories that threaten serious injury to the domestic industry producing the apparel article in question.  Under those provisions, the tariffs could be reimposed in limited instances in which a domestic producer could establish a meritorious case.      Title I of the conference agreement would add certain other provisions the conferees believed necessary to the success of the program established under the African Growth and Opportunity Act.  Those include -- (1) encouraging the negotiation of trade-liberalizing agreements with interested Sub-Saharan Africa trading partners, (2) the permanent establishment of an Assistant United States Trade Representative for African Affairs, (3) a sense of the Congress resolution regarding the need for comprehensive debt relief for the world's poorest countries (most of which are in Sub-Saharan Africa), (4) targeting of U.S. technical assistance to foster the goals of the conference agreement with respect to Sub-Saharan Africa,  (5) encouraging the development of a special equity fund for fostering investment in Africa at the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation, (6) directing the expansion of U.S. Commerce Department initiatives designed to foster the development of African markets for U.S. exports, (7) the donation of air traffic control equipment no longer in use in the United States to eligible Sub-Saharan Africa countries,  (8) a sense of the Congress relating to efforts to combat desertification, and (9) authorization of a study regarding potential improvements in Sub-Saharan agricultural practices.      In addition, Title I contains two provisions that represent a step, but only a first step, toward the development of a comprehensive U.S. strategy to assist Sub-Saharan African countries combat the scourge of AIDS.  The two provisions express the sense of Congress that the combat of AIDS in affected Sub-Saharan Africa countries should form a central element of U.S. foreign policy in the region and that every effort should be made to encourage U.S. businesses to provide assistance to Sub-Saharan Africa countries to prevent and reduce the incidence of AIDS, including the establishment of an HIV/AIDS Response Fund to provide for coordination of public and private sector efforts.      Title II -- Trade Benefits for the Caribbean Basin      Title II incorporates the conference agreement on the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act, which is an expansion of the benefits of what is commonly referred to as the Caribbean Basin Initiative or ""CBI.""  The structure of Title II is much like that of Title I -- Title II establishes basic findings concerning the need to restore the margin of preference CBI countries enjoyed prior to the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (""NAFTA""), as well as to improve economic opportunities, foster the CBI beneficiary countries participation in both existing and proposed trade arrangements in the region, and to foster economic development in light of the devastation wrought in the region by multiple natural disasters in recent years.      As was true of Title I, Title II is subject to the Harkin-Helms Amendment which would add to the list of existing eligibility criteria for participation in the CBI program a requirement that the beneficiary countries have fulfilled their obligation to implement their international commitments with respect to the worst forms of child labor.  As noted above, those include slavery, indentured servitude and child prostitution.      The original Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act excluded certain products as did the GSP.  Title II of the conference agreement would now extend duty-free treatment to such articles subject to the special rules affecting textiles and apparel described below.  With respect to textiles and apparel, Title II would provide duty-free and quota-free access to the U.S. market for apparel made with U.S. fabric, yarn and thread.  Title II would also authorize duty-free and quota free access to certain apparel items made from fabric knit in the CBI region subject to an initial annual limit of 250 million square meter equivalents for knit apparel items other than outerwear t-shirts and an initial annual limit of 4.2 million dozen outerwear t-shirts.  Both limits would be subject of a growth rate of 16 percent compounded annually through the first three years following the first year of the program.      Title I would apply certain exceptions and exemptions akin to those set out above with respect to Title I.  Those include exceptions regarding the use of a de minimis amount of fabric originating in a third country, with the exception of certain fabrics made from elastomeric yarns, as well as exemptions for the use of fabric and other components in the manufacture of certain undergarments and for use as findings and trimmings on apparel.      Title II contains provisions designed to combat illegal transshipment equivalent to those contained in Title I with respect to Sub-Saharan Africa.  Title II also contains a safeguard mechanism that could lead to the reimposition of tariffs on items that cause serious damage to the domestic producers of competing products in the United States.      As did Title I, Title II incorporates certain other provisions that the conferees determined would be helpful in fostering stronger trading links with the CBI region.  Those include (1) providing duty-free treatment to certain beverages made with Caribbean rum and (2) encouraging annual meetings between the United States Trade Representative and trade ministers from beneficiary countries in the CBI region with a view toward initiating trade liberalizing negotiations with interested beneficiary countries.     Title III -- Normal Trade Relations for Albania and Kyrgyzstan      The Senate-passed legislation that led to the Trade and Development Act of 200) contained provisions extending normal trade relations status to Albania and Kyrgyzstan.  Both have acceded to the World Trade Organization, as a result of which the United States is obliged, under the terms of its own participation in the WTO, to extend normal trade relations status under U.S. law.  That involves excluding them from the ambit of the Jackson-Vanik amendment which applies to former member states of the Soviet Union.      The conferees took special note that the freedom of emigration provisions of the Jackson-Vanik amendment were met in the case of Kyrgyzstan, the first of the former Soviet republics to graduate from coverage of the amendment.  The conferees underscored that they will apply a similar scrutiny to all other successor states to the Soviet Union in consideration of their exemption from the ambit of the Jackson-Vanik amendment.     Title IV -- Other Trade Provisions      Title Iv of the Trade and Development Act of 2000 contains a number of miscellaneous trade provisions.  They include the following items --       directions to the General Accounting Office (""GAO"") to prepare a report on the effectiveness of current trade adjustment assistance (""TAA"") programs and other federal and state job training programs;      provision of TAA benefits workers that were previously certified for such benefits in connection with the retirement of certain nuclear power facilities in Oregon;       reliquidation at zero rate of duty of certain nuclear fuel rod assemblies;      requirements that certain trade-related reports provided for under section 607 of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Appropriations Act, 1999, the International Financial Institutions Act,  and section 629 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 1999, be forwarded to the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means Committees;      implementation of rules of origin applicable to imports of certain flat goods made from silk, cotton, man-made and vegetable fibers in order to implement an agreement reached with the European Union resolving a prior dispute regarding such rules of origin;      establishment of a permanent chief agriculture negotiator in the Office of the United States Trade Representative;      requirements that the USTR regularly rotate products identified on any list of goods subject to retaliatory sanctions resulting from a trade dispute;      requirement that the Secretary of Labor, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture, report efficacy of current TAA programs as they apply to American farmers and provide recommendations on means by which such programs might be improved in order to effect their original intent that farmers be covered;      directions to the U.S. Customs Service to provide for weekly entry of merchandise produced in foreign trade zones to effect the intent of Congress as previously expressed in the Customs Modernization Act, which passed as part of the NAFTA implementing legislation in 1993; and      clarification that section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930, which authorizes the Customs Service to deny entry to imports manufactured with forced or indentured labor, includes forced or indentured child labor within its existing scope.      The final provision of Title IV contains the conference agreement regarding the Harkin-Helms Amendment discussed above with respect to the benefits extended under Titles I and II of the conference agreement, as well as under the existing GSP program.     Title V -- Imports of Certain Wool Articles      Title V would, consistent with the policy statement on tariff inversions contained in the Senate bill, reduce the impact of certain tariff inversions affecting the manufacture of certain apparel from worsted wool fabric.  Title V would reduce tariffs on imports of worsted wool fabric, certain worsted wool yarn, and fiber beginning January 1, 2000 for a period of three years.  In addition, Title V would also allow for the refund of duties currently paid on such items based on amounts imported of those items by individual producers of the identified apparel items, the fabric, and the yarn during calendar year 1999.  Title V would direct the creation of a fund for research and market development regarding production of improved wool fiber in the United States.     Title VI -- Revenue Provisions      Title VI of the conference agreement would include two revenue provisions.  The first would authorize the President to waive the application of section 901(j) of the Internal Revenue Code which denies foreign tax credit treatment to taxes paid to the local government on income earned in certain countries previously identified as supporters of international terrorism.  The President's waiver authority is subject to two conditions -- (1) the President must determine that such waiver is in the national interest of the United States and that it will expand trade opportunities for U.S. companies in such countries and (2) the President must report to the Congress not less than 30 days before granting the waiver, setting out his reasons for granting the waiver.      The second revenue provision would accelerate the rum excise tax coverover payments to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands currently provided under section 7652 of the Internal Revenue Code, subject to certain clarifications as to the conditions that apply to such payments."

ACTION: Notice of written exemptions.     SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency is issuing, as a direct  final action, written exemptions from the Acid Rain permitting and  monitoring requirements to 7 utility units at 2 plants in accordance  with the Acid Rain Program regulations (40 CFR part 72). Because the  Agency does not anticipate receiving adverse comments, the exemptions  are being issued as a direct final action.  DATES: Each of the exemptions issued in this direct final action will  be final on December 26, 1995, unless significant, adverse comments are  received by December 13, 1995. If significant, adverse comments are  timely received on any exemption in this direct final action, that  exemption will be withdrawn through a notice in the Federal Register.  ADDRESSES: Administrative Records. The administrative record for the  exemptions, except information protected as confidential, may be viewed  during normal operating hours at EPA Region 5, 77 West Jackson Blvd.,  Chicago, IL 60604.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For plants in Minnesota, Franklin  Echevarria, (312) 886-9653, for plants in Wisconsin, Beth Valenziano,  (312) 886-2703.  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: All public comment received on any exemption  in this direct final action on which significant, adverse comments are  timely received will be addressed in a subsequent issuance or denial of  exemption based on the relevant draft exemption in the notice of draft  written exemptions that is published elsewhere in today's Federal  Register and that is identical to this direct final action.     Under the Acid Rain Program regulations (40 CFR 72.7), utilities  may petition EPA for an exemption from permitting and monitoring  requirements for any new utility unit that serves one or more  generators with total nameplate capacity of 25 MW or less and burns  only fuels with a sulfur content of 0.05 percent or less by weight. On  the earlier of the date a unit exempted under 40 CFR 72.7 burns any  fuel with a sulfur content in excess of 0.05 percent by weight or 24  months prior to the date the exempted unit first serves one or more  generators with total nameplate capacity in excess of 25 MW, the unit  shall no longer be exempted under 40 CFR 72.7 and shall be subject to  all permitting and monitoring requirements of the Acid Rain Program.     EPA is issuing written exemptions to the following new units,  effective from January 1, 1996 through December 31, 2000:     IEA Georgia Pacific units 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 in Minnesota. The  designated representative is William C. Douglas.     Oneida Casino units 1 and 2 in Wisconsin. The designated  representative is Gary T. Van Helvoirt.      Dated: November 3, 1995.  Brian J.

The following investigative approaches are designed to assist our stakeholders and customer base, the American sheep and textile industries and the consumer:        Apply enzymatic processes to selectively modify the surface of wool to whiten,     biopolish, and confer shrinkage resistance and comfort to wool without causing loss in     tactile, aesthetic, and end-use performance properties.     Chemically alter wool through functional group modification for improved performance and     novel enduses.     Apply knowledge of chemical dyeing behavior of wool to selectively modify fiber blend     constituents to achieve union dyeing using a wool dye.     Develop analytical FTIR spectroscopic techniques to record chemical changes in wool     fibers and fabrics and to determine the effects of natural and synthetic agents on keratin     structure.     Apply the method of Digital Image Analysis with algorithms to examine fiber, yarn and     fabric structures in historic and modern textiles to measure color uniformity, dye     penetration, quality of union shade, and structural integrity.

Desired objectives can be to effect a washed appearance   in denims, to impart a smooth appearance by removing surface fuzz fibers,   or to remove tangled bundles of surface fibers that do not pick up dyes and thus result in white specks.  Many surfactants are used in textile          processing.  In this paper the effect of inclusion of the non-ionic         surfactant Tween 20 in the reaction system was investigated and was found   to enhance the action of the cellulases towards crystalline celluloses such as Avicel, cotton, and Tencel. These results will be useful both to         scientists conducting research on the enzymatic modification of cotton      textiles and to textile companies using industrial cellulase preparations   in processing.

On May 4, the House passed the conference agreement by a vote of 309-110. Passage of the conference agreement by the Senate would send the first significant trade legislation to pass both Houses of Congress since 1988, other than the implementation of trade agreements under special procedures, to the President for his signature.  The following discussion provides an overview of the conference agreement by title.  Title I -- Extension of Certain Trade Benefits to Sub-Saharan Africa Title I incorporates the conferee's agreement on the benefits available under the African Growth and Opportunity Act. To obtain the benefits of Title I, a potential beneficiary must be listed among the 48 African countries identified in the bill and meet certain eligibility requirements.  The eligibility requirements include, as a first step, satisfaction of the basic eligibility criteria of the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences (""GSP""), which applies to all developing countries and includes basic commitments to foster open trade, avoid certain acts that discourage investment, and take appropriate steps to afford internationally recognized worker rights. The conference agreement would add one additional item to the GSP eligibility requirements -- the Harkin-Helms Amendment -- that would also require that beneficiary countries to fulfill their international commitments to eliminate the worst forms of child labor, such as slavery, indentured servitude and child prostitution. The Harkin-Helms Amendment would apply to all GSP beneficiary countries, not to Africa alone.  In addition to the GSP criteria, Title I would require the President to determine that the beneficiary countries were meeting certain eligibility criteria that were specific to Africa. Those include promotion of market economies, democratic societies, and open trading system, economic policies to reduce poverty, and a system to combat corruption and bribery. The President would be obliged to monitor the beneficiary countries' progress on these criteria on an annual basis, as he does with all developing countries participating in other U.S. programs, like GSP, the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (""CBERA""), or the Andean Trade Preferences Act.  Title I would authorize U.S. participation in a United States-Sub-Saharan Africa Trade and Economic Cooperation Forum to foster the goals set out in the conference agreement. The conference agreement calls for annual meetings of the Forum, in cooperation with non-governmental organizations and in consultation with Congress. As part of the expected ongoing consultation with Congress, the conference agreement requires periodic reports from the President regarding the achievement of the conference agreement's objectives.  Title I would extend the following trade benefits to eligible Sub-Saharan Africa beneficiary countries. The conference agreement would eliminate existing quotas applied under the Uruguay Round Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (which applied only to Kenya and South Africa and generally went unfilled). Title I would extend duty-free and quota-free treatment to all apparel products made in a beneficiary country using American fabric, yarn and thread. Title I would then add similar benefits for apparel made from fabric made in the Sub-Saharan African region over the life of the bill (8 years) up to a set percentage of overall apparel imports into the United States. That figure would start at 1.5 percent of U.S. apparel imports in the first year of the program, then rise to 3.5 percent of U.S. apparel imports by the final year.  For the least developed countries, Title I would extend the same duty-free and quota-free treatment to their apparel exports to the United States, subject to the same conditions, but authorize their use, for a period of 4 years, of fabric formed in third countries. The added benefits are intended to give the least developed countries (defined here as those with annual per capita gross domestic product of $1500 or less) in order to allow them a head start in developing the infrastructure necessary to produce for world markets.  Title I would create certain exceptions to the rules of origin set out above in the case of fabrics not made in the United States and a general de minis exception that would permit the use of limited amounts of fabric originating in third countries (up to 7 percent by value) of apparel items to which the rules would otherwise apply. Title I would also create exceptions to those rules of origin that would permit the use of third country-origin items in the manufacture of certain undergarments and with respect to findings and trimmings.  Title I would also extend duty-free treatment to other articles previously excluded from the Generalized System of Preferences, including petroleum, watches, certain electronic and steel articles, footwear, handbags, flat goods, and glass products, among others.  To protect against customs fraud designed to gain access to the program illegally (commonly referred to as ""transshipment""), the conference agreement contains unprecedented protections. They include requirements that the beneficiary countries develop their own effective infrastructure, with U.S. technical assistance, to combat transshipment and cooperate fully with the U.S.  Customs Service in its investigation of alleged customs fraud. In addition, with respect to any individual exporter found fraudulently to have claimed the trade benefits extended under the conference agreement, Title I would expel the exporter from eligibility for the program's benefits for a period of 5 years.  Title I would also authorize the appropriation of funds necessary to improve the U.S. Customs Service's investigation of transshipment generally, in order to contribute to the success of the program's benefits.  In addition, Title I would provide a mechanism by which domestic producers of apparel articles competing with those imported under Title I from Sub-Saharan Africa (or manufacturers of the U.S. fabric inputs into such apparel articles) would petition for relief from surges in imports in particular categories that threaten serious injury to the domestic industry producing the apparel article in question. Under those provisions, the tariffs could be reimposed in limited instances in which a domestic producer could establish a meritorious case.  Title I of the conference agreement would add certain other provisions the conferees believed necessary to the success of the program established under the African Growth and Opportunity Act. Those include -- (1) encouraging the negotiation of trade-liberalizing agreements with interested Sub-Saharan Africa trading partners, (2) the permanent establishment of an Assistant United States Trade Representative for African Affairs, (3) a sense of the Congress resolution regarding the need for comprehensive debt relief for the world's poorest countries (most of which are in Sub-Saharan Africa), (4) targeting of U.S. technical assistance to foster the goals of the conference agreement with respect to Sub-Saharan Africa, (5) encouraging the development of a special equity fund for fostering investment in Africa at the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation, (6) directing the expansion of U.S. Commerce Department initiatives designed to foster the development of African markets for U.S. exports, (7) the donation of air traffic control equipment no longer in use in the United States to eligible Sub-Saharan Africa countries, (8) a sense of the Congress relating to efforts to combat desertification, and (9) authorization of a study regarding potential improvements in Sub-Saharan agricultural practices.  In addition, Title I contains two provisions that represent a step, but only a first step, toward the development of a comprehensive U.S. strategy to assist Sub-Saharan African countries combat the scourge of AIDS. The two provisions express the sense of Congress that the combat of AIDS in affected Sub-Saharan Africa countries should form a central element of U.S. foreign policy in the region and that every effort should be made to encourage U.S. businesses to provide assistance to Sub-Saharan Africa countries to prevent and reduce the incidence of AIDS, including the establishment of an HIV/AIDS Response Fund to provide for coordination of public and private sector efforts.  Title II -- Trade Benefits for the Caribbean Basin Title II incorporates the conference agreement on the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act, which is an expansion of the benefits of what is commonly referred to as the Caribbean Basin Initiative or ""CBI."" The structure of Title II is much like that of Title I -- Title II establishes basic findings concerning the need to restore the margin of preference CBI countries enjoyed prior to the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (""NAFTA""), as well as to improve economic opportunities, foster the CBI beneficiary countries participation in both existing and proposed trade arrangements in the region, and to foster economic development in light of the devastation wrought in the region by multiple natural disasters in recent years.  As was true of Title I, Title II is subject to the Harkin-Helms Amendment which would add to the list of existing eligibility criteria for participation in the CBI program a requirement that the beneficiary countries have fulfilled their obligation to implement their international commitments with respect to the worst forms of child labor. As noted above, those include slavery, indentured servitude and child prostitution.  The original Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act excluded certain products as did the GSP. Title II of the conference agreement would now extend duty-free treatment to such articles subject to the special rules affecting textiles and apparel described below. With respect to textiles and apparel, Title II would provide duty-free and quota-free access to the U.S. market for apparel made with U.S. fabric, yarn and thread. Title II would also authorize duty-free and quota free access to certain apparel items made from fabric knit in the CBI region subject to an initial annual limit of 250 million square meter equivalents for knit apparel items other than outerwear t-shirts and an initial annual limit of 4.2 million dozen outerwear t-shirts. Both limits would be subject of a growth rate of 16 percent compounded annually through the first three years following the first year of the program.  Title I would apply certain exceptions and exemptions akin to those set out above with respect to Title I. Those include exceptions regarding the use of a de minimis amount of fabric originating in a third country, with the exception of certain fabrics made from elastomeric yarns, as well as exemptions for the use of fabric and other components in the manufacture of certain undergarments and for use as findings and trimmings on apparel.  Title II contains provisions designed to combat illegal transshipment equivalent to those contained in Title I with respect to Sub-Saharan Africa. Title II also contains a safeguard mechanism that could lead to the reimposition of tariffs on items that cause serious damage to the domestic producers of competing products in the United States.  As did Title I, Title II incorporates certain other provisions that the conferees determined would be helpful in fostering stronger trading links with the CBI region. Those include (1) providing duty-free treatment to certain beverages made with Caribbean rum and (2) encouraging annual meetings between the United States Trade Representative and trade ministers from beneficiary countries in the CBI region with a view toward initiating trade liberalizing negotiations with interested beneficiary countries.  Title III -- Normal Trade Relations for Albania and Kyrgyzstan The Senate-passed legislation that led to the Trade and Development Act of 200) contained provisions extending normal trade relations status to Albania and Kyrgyzstan. Both have acceded to the World Trade Organization, as a result of which the United States is obliged, under the terms of its own participation in the WTO, to extend normal trade relations status under U.S. law. That involves excluding them from the ambit of the Jackson-Vanik amendment which applies to former member states of the Soviet Union.  The conferees took special note that the freedom of emigration provisions of the Jackson-Vanik amendment were met in the case of Kyrgyzstan, the first of the former Soviet republics to graduate from coverage of the amendment. The conferees underscored that they will apply a similar scrutiny to all other successor states to the Soviet Union in consideration of their exemption from the ambit of the Jackson-Vanik amendment.  Title IV -- Other Trade Provisions Title Iv of the Trade and Development Act of 2000 contains a number of miscellaneous trade provisions. They include the following items:  -- directions to the General Accounting Office (""GAO"") to prepare a report on the effectiveness of current trade adjustment assistance (""TAA"") programs and other federal and state job training programs;  -- provision of TAA benefits workers that were previously certified for such benefits in connection with the retirement of certain nuclear power facilities in Oregon;   reliquidation at zero rate of duty of certain nuclear fuel rod assemblies;   requirements that certain trade-related reports provided for under section 607 of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Appropriations Act, 1999, the International Financial Institutions Act, and section 629 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 1999, be forwarded to the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means Committees;  -- implementation of rules of origin applicable to imports of certain flat goods made from silk, cotton, man-made and vegetable fibers in order to implement an agreement reached with the European Union resolving a prior dispute regarding such rules of origin;   establishment of a permanent chief agriculture negotiator in the Office of the United States Trade Representative;  -- requirements that the USTR regularly rotate products identified on any list of goods subject to retaliatory sanctions resulting from a trade dispute;  -- requirement that the Secretary of Labor, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture, report efficacy of current TAA programs as they apply to American farmers and provide recommendations on means by which such programs might be improved in order to effect their original intent that farmers be covered;  -- directions to the U.S. Customs Service to provide for weekly entry of merchandise produced in foreign trade zones to effect the intent of Congress as previously expressed in the Customs Modernization Act, which passed as part of the NAFTA implementing legislation in 1993; and  -- clarification that section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930, which authorizes the Customs Service to deny entry to imports manufactured with forced or indentured labor, includes forced or indentured child labor within its existing scope.  The final provision of Title IV contains the conference agreement regarding the Harkin-Helms Amendment discussed above with respect to the benefits extended under Titles I and II of the conference agreement, as well as under the existing GSP program.  Title V -- Imports of Certain Wool Articles Title V would, consistent with the policy statement on tariff inversions contained in the Senate bill, reduce the impact of certain tariff inversions affecting the manufacture of certain apparel from worsted wool fabric. Title V would reduce tariffs on imports of worsted wool fabric, certain worsted wool yarn, and fiber beginning January 1, 2000, for a period of three years. In addition, Title V would also allow for the refund of duties currently paid on such items based on amounts imported of those items by individual producers of the identified apparel items, the fabric, and the yarn during calendar year 1999. Title V would direct the creation of a fund for research and market development regarding production of improved wool fiber in the United States.  Title VI -- Revenue Provisions Title VI of the conference agreement would include two revenue provisions. The first would authorize the President to waive the application of section 901(j) of the Internal Revenue Code which denies foreign tax credit treatment to taxes paid to the local government on income earned in certain countries previously identified as supporters of international terrorism. The President's waiver authority is subject to two conditions -- (1) the President must determine that such waiver is in the national interest of the United States and that it will expand trade opportunities for U.S. companies in such countries and (2) the President must report to the Congress not less than 30 days before granting the waiver, setting out his reasons for granting the waiver.  The second revenue provision would accelerate the rum excise tax cover overpayments to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands currently provided under section 7652 of the Internal Revenue Code, subject to certain clarifications as to the conditions that apply to such payments.

GX093-26-3472081	TEKTRAN   NEPS: HOW DO THEY IMPACT COTTON QUALITY?      Author(s):    BEL BERGER  PATRICIA               ROBERTS  GRANT                             Interpretive Summary:      A nep, defined as an entanglement of fibers, is currently a defect in       cotton fabrics that is difficult to quantify and predict.                   Classically, neps are measured by counting them in a card web and used      to predict the quality of the resulting fabric.  This method is             tedious and time consuming.  Neps can be caused by environmental            factors during growth, processing and some are inherent to particular       varieties. Biological neps are caused by trash particles entangled in       the cotton and result in small dark specks in the greige fabric.            Mechanical neps can be found in ginned lint, card web, yarns and cloth      and are influenced by mechanical processing.  This research                 demonstrates how AFIS can be used for a high-speed measure of neps in       fiber samples. Image analysis is another technique that is shown to         quantify white speck neps on dyed fabric. White speck neps are neps         that contain immature clusters of fibers and are often not visible as       defects until dyeing, causing large financial losses. It has been           estimated that the U.S. Textile industry has had financial losses as        high as $200 million per year due to white specks. Initial research         has shown a strong correlation between AFIS card sliver data and white      speck content of fabric. Also, this research identifies two high speed      techniques to evaluate neps in fibers as well as fabrics.  The U.S. &       Australia will be collaborating in research to: 1) gain fundamental         knowledge of the nature and behavior of cotton and neps; 2) gather          baseline data on the level and characteristics of neps in Australian        cotton; and 3) predict white specks on fabric using high-speed fiber        data.

They can be produced also by treating cotton with non-formaldehyde polycarboxylic crosslinking agents.  In either case the finished fabrics    are not dyeable with dyes normally used to dye cotton.  However, through    treatment of cotton with certain reactive nitrogenous compounds in          conjunction with the crosslinking agents, fabrics are produced that are     both smooth drying and dyeable with several classes of anionic dyes         including some dyes that are not even useful for dyeing untreated cotton.   These processes have application in the garment dyeing field, whereby       fabrics are dyed after they have been fabricated into garments.  No such    fabric as described is commercially available.  Presently, only untreated   cotton garments, which do not have smooth drying properties after           processing, are dyed.  This report provides information of value to textile finishers, researchers, garment manufacturers, and to those engaged in the  dyeing of textiles.

APPROACH: Currently, the use of short staple cotton in greige, bleached and mercerized forms has not made a significant impact on the nonwoven textile market.  This research will involve the preparation of nonwoven webs from short staple cotton in each of these three states, to study their absorption properties both before and after chemical modification, the preparation of novel spunlaced fabrics, and finally the preparation of high-loft insulation materials.  Needle entanglement, hydroentanglement, and thermal bonding techniques as well as combinations of each will be evaluated.  In order to better assess the usefulness of kenaf and other natural fibers as filters for metals, organic pollutants and biologically undesirable entities, nonwoven mats will be produced.  In this form these kenaf fibers should act most efficiently as filters and sorbents for these unwanted materials.  Blends of kenaf, cotton, and other natural and synthetic fibers will be studied.

APPROACH: Growing public demand for healthy products and environmentally responsible  practices supports the use of naturally pigmented cottons that do not require chemical dyeing.  The objective of this research is to develop methods to produce superior textile goods from these inherently short, weak fibers.  A diversity of colored cultivars will be examined to better understand and characterize the unique attributes of these fibers.  Methods will be developed to use them in combination with other natural or synthetic materials to facilitate processing and to improve the physical and functional properties of the resultant textiles.  Research will involve intimate or strategic blends incorporating novel fibers of various types into woven and nonwoven materials.  The development and use of new and existing bicomponent spinning technologies will also be involved.

It is covered with waxes, which are          chemically connected to pectins, and they are enmeshed in the basket        weave structure of the cellulosic primary wall.  Because of its wax         coating, cotton is practically waterproof.  The normal industrial           method for cleaning cotton fabric involves three steps: de-sizing with      amylase enzymes to remove yarn sizing; scouring with caustic soda to        remove waxes; and bleaching with hydrogen peroxide to obtain uniform        whiteness.  The effluent from this process is environmentally toxic,        but the process is necessary to prepare fabric for dyeing, durable          press finishing, etc.  Current research is investigating                    environmentally friendly methods of removing cotton waxes.  Super           critical carbon dioxide extraction, as well as lipase and pectinase         enzymes have been studied.  Water absorbancy, wicking tests, and            scanning electron microscopy have been used in evaluating results.          These show potential for developing a new non-polluting cotton textile      process.  The fabric hand is softer and strength retention is as good       as that of fabric processed by conventional methods.  This process will     benefit the textile finishing industry and may open a new market for        enzymes in textile wet processing.

This reduces         the market for both fibers.  Cotton and wool/cotton blend textiles          have been pre-treated with three formulations to impart one step            dyeing by wool dyes to both types of fibers.  Two of the formulations       were composed of resins used for durable press (DP) finishing of            cotton plus a protein additive and the third was a coating having           protein character.  Fabrics pre-treated by all three processes were         then dyed with a wool dye.  Initially, acceptable dye levels were           achieved with all three pre-treatments, but color fastness tests            revealed that the DP resins gave better dyeing results than the             coating and were more durable to laundering.  Examination with the          light microscope after swelling and solubility tests showed why the DP      resins were more durable treatments.  Examination with the scanning         electron microscope after laundering tests showed which DP resin            finish would cause less damage to treated fabrics.  This finish will        benefit both cotton farmers and sheep ranchers by providing a market        for more cotton and wool.  It will also benefit the American textile        finishing industry by providing a less costly one step dyeing of            trans-seasonal wool/cotton blend textiles.

This research is    relevant to textile manufacturers that produce chemical finishes designed   to create smooth drying fabrics from two general types of materials--those  that release formaldehyde and those that don't.  Workers' health is an      important factor and federal regulations may require monitoring.  Imported  fabrics may not be well labeled, and a means of identifying finishing       materials is desirable.  Thermal analyses were successful in recognizing    the finish/additive in this study.  Successful separation of three dyes     applied after finishing was difficult.  A new technique involving thermal   analyses and measuring the mass of fragments of the evolved gases in one    test was studied.  These basic findings are relevant to the industry as     possible quality control tests and may impact forensic or U.S. Custom       Service scientists in the future.

ACTION: Notice.     SUMMARY: Title IV of the Clean Air Act requires EPA to establish the  Acid Rain Program to reduce the adverse environmental and public health  effects of acidic deposition. Under titles IV and V of the Act, state  and local permitting authorities develop and administer acid rain  programs as part of their title V operating permits programs. The  purpose of this notice is to (1) provide a status report on the  progress of specific state and local permitting authorities in  establishing regulatory authority to issue acid rain permits, (2)  describe in general terms the degree to which state and local  permitting authorities can currently take part in acid rain permit  issuance given the current status of their title V programs and (3) to  identify which permitting authorities should receive Phase II acid rain  permit applications (due January 1, 1996) from designated  representatives of affected sources. This notice is for informational  purposes only and does not supplant any other Federal Register notices  under title V.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert Miller, U.S. EPA, Acid Rain  Division (6204J), 401 M St., SW, Washington, DC 20460, (202) 233-9077.  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On August 29, 1995, the Acid Rain Division  issued guidance describing the extent to which permitting authorities  could participate in the acid rain permit issuance process given the  status of their title V programs, including the acid rain portion. The  guidance outlined criteria by which acid rain permitting authorities  are grouped into one of three categories, `A,' `B,' or `C.'     Category A permitting authorities have EPA-approved title V  programs with acid rain regulations that are sufficient for issuing  Phase II acid rain permits covering sulfur dioxide. Such permits must  be issued no later than December 31, 1997.     Category B permitting authorities have not yet received final EPA  approval of their title V programs and acid rain regulations, and so  cannot yet issue acid rain permits. However, they have sufficient  regulatory authority to perform completeness reviews and process Phase  II acid rain permits up to issuance of draft permits. Most category B  permitting authorities are expected to receive final EPA approval of  their title V programs and their acid rain regulations sometime in  1996. If, as anticipated, their title V programs and acid rain  regulations are approved by January 1, 1997, they will be the  permitting authorities for issuing acid rain permits to sources within  their respective jurisdictions.      Category C permitting authorities have also not yet received EPA  approval of their title V programs, but have not yet established a  sufficient degree of regulatory authority, e.g., because they lack  final title V and acid rain regulations or because their title V  programs have been rejected. Category C permitting authorities will  issue the Phase II acid rain permits if their title V programs and acid  rain regulations are approved by January 1, 1997. If not, then EPA  intends to begin to take steps to issue the initial Phase II acid rain  permits.      The designated representatives of affected sources within the  jurisdiction of permitting authorities in categories A or B should  submit the original Phase II acid rain permit application and all  required copies to the appropriate state or local permitting authority.  The application should not be submitted to EPA. The designated  representatives of affected sources with state or local permitting  authorities in category C must submit the original Phase II acid rain  permit application and 1 copy to the appropriate EPA Regional office  and two copies to their respective state or local permitting authority.     The status of state and local acid rain programs is noted on a  document updated weekly on EPA's Technology Transfer Network (TTN) and  is available for downloading under the ``Clean Air Act,'' ``Title IV,''  ``Policy and Guidance,'' subdirectories, entitled ``ARDGUID.WPF.''     As of November 15, 1995, the status of state and local permitting  authorities with regard to acid rain is as follows:  Region 1  Category A: None  Category B: Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont Category C: Connecticut, Maine  Region 2  Category A: None  Category B: New Jersey  Category C: New York  Region 3  Category A: West Virginia  Category B: Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Washington D.C.

GX087-25-7177867	"TEKTRAN   A COMPUTER-CLEAN TECHNIQUE FOR DETECTING BLEND HOMOGENEITY OF A BICOMPONENT FABRIC      Author(s):    SAWHNEY  AMAR P                          Interpretive Summary:    One of the problems encountered in processing cotton with other fibers is   the lack of an efficient method for quickly assessing the homogeneity       (evenness) of the blend.  A technique developed by ARS scientists of        evaluating the appearance and defects of an electronically printed/dyed     cotton fabric has been applied to effectively assess the blend uniformity   of a cotton blend, or biocomponent fabric.  Basically, a specimen of the    fabric is ""electronically dyed"" in a continuous digital printing mode on    a color printer and subsequently evaluated for its surface appearance.      Since ink dispensing on a printer can be easily and precisely controlled,   and, since different fibers and their intimate-blend aggregates have        different affinities for a particular dye/ink pigment, a carefully          programmed ink flow/amount for a specific fabric produces significantly     different color shades on constituent fibers of the blend fabric.  Thus,    any fiber blending deficiency is reflected as a different color shade in a  subjective visual examination, or in an objective image analysis, of the    digitally printed fabric.  This technique may be used to ensure timely      on-line/off-line fabric quality control and may also be used in the         laboratory to quickly and effectively detect and identify any unwanted      fiber or yarn mix in a multi-component fabric.  This will enable spinners   and weavers to quickly identify quality problems, thereby preventing poorer quality textiles from reaching the consuming public.

ACTION:  Request for public comments.     SUMMARY:  This notice requests public comments on the administration of the allocation of the speciality sugar tariff-rate quota (TRQ), which is an administrative breakout of the refined sugar TRQ provided for in Additional U.S. Note 5 (a)(i) of Chapter 17 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS).   DATES:  Comments should be received on or before July 31, 2001 to be assured of consideration.   ADDRESSES:  Comments should be mailed or delivered to the Director, Import Policies and Programs Division, Foreign Agricultural Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1400 Independence Avenue, SW., AgStop 1021, Washington DC 20250-1021, or e-mailed to  Blabey@fas.usda.gov  . Comments received may be inspected between 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. at room 5531-S, 1400 Independence Avenue, SW, Washington, DC 20250.   FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:  Richard Blabey at the address above, or   telephone at (202) 720-2916, or e-mail at  Blabey@fas.usda.gov  . Persons with disabilities who require this request for comment in an alternative means of communication (Braille, large print, audiotape,  etc.) should contact the USDA Target Center at (202) 720-2600 (voice and TDD).   SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  USDA is preparing to establish the FY 2002 speciality sugar allocation under which imports may enter under subheadings 1701.12.10, 1701.91.10, 1701.99.10, 1702.90.10, 2106.90.44 of the HTS. Imports must be accompanied by a speciality sugar certificate issued by the USDA Certifying Authority to be eligible to enter under his TRQ allocation.      USDA is proposing to administer the speciality sugar TRQ in two tranches. The first tranche would permit imports not exceeding 1,656 metric tons raw value to enter under this TRQ beginning in October 2001. All speciality sugars identified in 15 CFR 2011, Subpart B would be eligible for entry. When combined with other refined sugars, syrups, and molasses entered under the above HTS subheadings, this tranche would permit sufficient imports of specialty sugar to satisfy the requirement of Additional U.S. Note 5 of Chapter 17 of the HTS that the Secretary establish a TRQ of not less than 22,000 metric tons raw value annually for refined sugar.      A second tranche would permit entry of speciality sugars not currently commercially produced in the United States or reasonably available from domestic sources. For FY 2002, USDA proposes to establish the quantity permitted entry under the second tranche at a level sufficient to assure that supplies of various types of specialty sugars meet domestic demand at reasonable prices. USDA would make known the size of the second tranche in its press release announcing the establishment of the FY 2002 refined sugar TRQ. The second tranche would be adjusted annually thereafter to reflect changing market conditions.      USDA also proposes that beginning in FY 2002 all imports of specialty sugar entered under the TRQ must be entered in bags containing not more than 50 kilos of sugar stowed in containers. This is the traditional method of importing specialty sugars and is intended  to facilitate enforcement of the Regulation for specialty sugar.      USDA is soliciting comments on the above proposals for administering the specialty sugar TRQ and, in particular, solicits comments regarding appropriate dates for announcing the refined sugar TRQ and for opening of the second specialty sugar tranche.       Signed at Washington, DC, on June 22, 2001.

Summary of Fiber Analysis Guidelines        The various analytical methods     available for fiber analysis yield different kinds of information.     It is highly desirable to select a combination of methods and     apply them in an order that provides the most exclusionary information     first. By doing this, the examiner optimizes accuracy, precision,     and production while most effectively using the laboratory's     resources.        Back to the top          5.0.          Significance and Use        5.1. Microscopy      At a minimum, a fiber examiner must employ a stereomicroscope,     a comparison microscope, and a compound light microscope equipped     with polarized light capability. The examiner must view questioned     and known fibers side by side at the same magnifications in visible     light, and alternative lighting, such as polarized light or fluorescent     lighting, although not necessary, is recommended if the equipment     allows. For some analyses, for example, in testing for solubility,     it may be necessary to place questioned and known fibers next     to each other on the same slide or in adjacent wells of a spot     plate. Extreme caution must be exercised with loose fibers in     these circumstances so as not to confuse the source of each fiber.        5.2. Comparison      Typically, fiber examinations involve a comparison of samples     from known and questioned sources to determine whether they are     consistent with having originated from the same source (e.g.,     carpet from a suspect's car compared with foreign fibers removed     from the victim's clothing). This comparison involves the recognition     and evaluation of class characteristics, which associate materials     to a group but never to a single source. Conversely, individual     characteristics allow the association between two or more items     with each other to the exclusion of all other items. For fiber     examiners, this most often occurs when pieces of fabric or cordage     are physically matched.        5.3. Source Determination      Textile fibers can be exchanged between individuals, between     individuals and objects, and between objects. When fibers are     associated with a specific source, such as fabric from the victim,     suspect, or scene, a value is placed on that association. The     probative weight of this value is dependent upon many factors.     The following subsections describe those factors.        5.3.1. Fiber type or types     found;      5.3.2. Fiber color or colors;      5.3.3. Number of fibers found;      5.3.4. Fiber location or locations;      5.3.5. Fabric type or types;      5.3.6. Multiple fiber associations;      5.3.7. Nature of contact; and       5.3.8.Fiber transfer and persistence.        Whether a fiber is transferred     and detected is also dependent on the nature and duration of     the contact between the suspect, the victim, or both and the     persistence of the fibers after they have been transferred.        5.3.1. Fiber Type or     Types.  The rarity     or commonness of the fiber types found at a crime scene or on     a victim or suspect affects their probative value. Cotton fibers     are by far the most commonly used plant fibers in textile production.     The type of cotton, the fibers' length, and the degree of twist     contribute to the diversity found in cotton fibers. Processing     techniques, such as mercerization, and color applications also     influence the value of cotton fiber identifications. The presence     of other less common plant fibers at a crime scene or on the     clothing of a victim or suspect increases its significance.        The most common animal fiber     used in textile production is wool originating from sheep. The     fineness or coarseness of woolen fibers often dictates the end     use of wool. The finer woolen fibers are used in the production     of clothing, whereas the coarser fibers are found in carpet.     The diameter and the degree of scale protrusion of the fibers     are other important characteristics. Woolen fibers from other     animals may also be found, including camel, alpaca, cashmere,     and mohair. The identification of less common animal hairs, fibers,     or both at a crime scene or on the clothing of a suspect or victim     would have increased significance.        Over half of all fibers used     in the production of textile materials are manufactured. Some     manufactured fibers originate from natural materials such as     cotton or wood, whereas others originate from synthetic materials.     All nonnaturally occurring fibers are manufactured, but not all     manufactured fibers are synthetic (e.g., rayon). Certain types     of manufactured fibers are more common than others. Polyester     and nylon fibers are the most commonly encountered manufactured     fibers, followed by rayons, acetates, and acrylics. There are     also many other less commonly manufactured fibers. The amount     of production, the end use, the cross-sectional shape, microscopic     characteristics, and other traits of the fiber help to influence     the degree of rarity of a particular fiber type.        5.3.2. Fiber Color     or Colors.  One     of the greatest variations seen in textiles is color. Thus, color     greatly influences the significance of a fiber comparison. Synthetic     dyes and pigments belong to 29 different chemical categories     with more than a dozen different application methods (7). Even     simple dyes might require between eight and ten processes to     convert the raw materials into a finished dye. Given that the     total annual production of any particular dye might not amount     to more than 10 tons and that small process batches are becoming     the rule in the dyeing industry, color becomes a powerful discriminant.     Color is particularly significant when the gamut of colors is     spread out over the range of garments and carpeting produced     in any one year and even more so when multiplied by the number     of garments and carpets produced in previous years.        Individual fibers can be     colored before being spun into yarn, yarns can be dyed after     being spun, or the fabric can be dyed before or after its construction.     Color can also be applied to the surface of a fabric by printing.     The absorbance of the dye along the fiber length suggests the     dyes and dyeing method used. Fading and discoloration may also     add increased significance to a fiber association.        5.3.3. Number of Fibers.  The number of fibers identified     on the clothing of a victim associated to the clothing of a suspect     is important in determining actual contact. The greater the number     of fibers, the more likely that direct contact occurred between     these individuals. The converse is not necessarily true, however,     and even one fiber association can have probative and scientific     value. Additionally, finding no fibers does not de facto mean     that no contact occurred. Each case is different, and the examiner     must weigh all of the relevant factors before determining the     significance of the evidence.        5.3.4. Fiber Location.  Where the fibers are found also     affects the probative value of a particular fiber association.     The location of fibers on different areas of the body or on specific     items at the scene can influence the significance of the fiber     association.        5.3.5. Fabric Type.  Fabric construction affects the     number and types of fibers that may be transferred. Tightly woven     or knitted fabrics shed fewer fibers than loosely knit or woven     fabrics. Fabrics composed of filament yarns shed less than fabric     composed of spun yarns. Certain types of fibers also transfer     more readily. The condition and wear of the fabric also affects     the degree of fiber transfers: Newer fabrics may have an abundance     of loosely adhering fibers on the surface of the fabric, whereas     worn fabrics may have damaged areas that easily shed fibers.     Damage to a fabric caused during physical contact greatly increases     the likelihood of fiber transfer.        5.3.6. Multiple Fiber     Associations.      If many different fiber types are associated among the suspect,     victim, and scene, then the likelihood that contact occurred     between these items is greatly increased. Each associated fiber     transfer is considered to be an independent event, and multiple     associations undermine an argument that the fibers were all deposited     by coincidence.        5.3.7. Nature of Contact.  The type of physical contact between     a suspect and a victim helps to determine the number of fibers     transferred and the value placed on their discovery. Violent     physical contact of an extended duration may result in many fiber     transfers.        5.3.8. Fiber Transfer     and Persistence.      Textile fibers are transferred to the surface of a fabric either     by direct (primary) transfer or indirect (secondary) transfer.     The likelihood of transfer depends on the types of fabric involved     in the contact and the nature and duration of the contact. Studies     have shown that transferred fibers are lost at a geometric rate,     depending on the types of fabrics involved and on the movement     of the clothing after contact (see endnote 1). For example, the     clothing of a homicide victim may retain transferred fibers for     a longer time because the victim is not moving. Therefore, under     these circumstances it is difficult to predict precisely how     many fibers might remain on the clothing of a living individual     after a given period, but it is important for investigators to     retrieve clothing immediately.        Whenever a fiber is found in relation to a crime scene, victim,     or suspect, it has potential significance. Matching dyed fibers,     whether manufactured or natural, can be very meaningful, whereas     the matching of common fibers such as white cotton or blue denim     cotton can would be less significant. In some situations, however,     the presence of white cotton or blue denim cotton possibly still     has some meaning in resolving the truth of an issue. The discovery     of cross transfers (suspect[s] to victim[s] and vice versa) dramatically     increases the likelihood that two items came into contact and     greatly reduces the likelihood of chance occurrence.        When a fiber examiner associates     a questioned fiber to a known textile item, there are ultimately     two possible explanations: (a) The questioned fiber originated     from the known textile, or (b) the questioned fiber did not originate     from the known textile.        To say that the questioned     fiber originated from the known textile, it either had to be     the only fabric of its type ever produced or now existing, or     the transfer of fibers was directly observed. As neither of these     situations is likely to occur, fiber examiners must conclude     that because the questioned fibers exhibit the same results in     all tested properties as the fibers from the known sample, the     questioned fibers are consistent with originating from the source     textile. Other textile sources that incorporate the same fibers     can be ruled out only by context and availability. In order to     say that a fiber did not originate from a particular textile     is to know the history of the textile or have observed the fiber     transfer from another textile.        5.4. Volume of Fiber Production       It could be argued     that the large volume of fibers produced reduces the significance     of a fiber association discovered in a criminal case. It can     never be stated with certainty that a fiber originated from a     particular textile because other textiles are produced using     the same fiber types and color. The inability to positively associate     a fiber to a particular textile to the exclusion of all others,     however, does not mean that a fiber association is without value.     Considering the volume of textiles produced worldwide each year,     the number of textiles produced with any one fiber type and color     is extremely small. The likelihood of two or more manufacturers     exactly duplicating all of the aspects of the textile is extremely     remote (see endnote 2). Beyond the comments made previously about     color, shade tolerance differs between dyeing companies. Therefore,     color may vary demonstrably from batch to batch. Also, the life     span of a particular fabric must be considered. Only so much     of a given fabric of a particular color and fiber type is produced,     and it will eventually end up being destroyed or dumped in a     landfill.        The world produced approximately     80 billion pounds of fabric in 1995, about half of which was     cotton (5). The other approximately 44 billion pounds of fiber     were manufactured or synthetic. Table 1 provides U.S. fiber production     levels.                  Table 1.      U.S. Annual Production for Manufactured Fibers: 1995      (millions of pounds)               (Table 1 [6]). All these fibers were used in a variety of applications including but not limited to clothing, household textiles, carpeting, and industrial textiles.                                     Fiber                      Product                                      Polyester                      3,887                                      Nylon                      270                                      Olefin                      521                                      Rayon/Acetate/Triacetate                      498                                      Acrylic/Modacrylic                      432                       5.4.1. Significance.  As an example, given a yarn-dyed     nylon fiber from a knit polo shirt of a specific color, the significance     could be described in the following way:        5.4.1.1. Total fiber production;       5.4.1.2. Total nylon (of that type) production;       5.4.1.3. Total nylon production in staple form;      5.4.1.4. Total production of Item 3 in a particular denier, cross-section,     optical characteristics, and luster;       5.4.1.5. Total amount of Item 4 used in production of garments;       5.4.1.6. Total garments constructed in the same fashion, including     knit specifications, collar, and sleeve incorporating Item 5;      5.4.1.7. Total of Item 6 in a specific color;       5.4.1.8. Total of Item 7 from indistinguishable dye lots;       5.4.1.9. Total of Item 8 available for merchandising;      5.4.1.10. Total of Item 9 sold;       5.4.1.11. Total of Item 10 still in existence;       5.4.1.12. Total of Item 11 available to be connected with a particular     criminal offense; and      5.4.1.13. Total of Item 12 actually connected with a particular     criminal offense (i.e., found and submitted as evidence).        The fiber examiner is still     limited to stating that the questioned fibers are consistent     with originating from the evidence garment, with the understanding     that all other garments listed under Item 11 (subsection 5.4.1.11)     may or may not be distinguishable from the evidence garment by     fiber analysis alone. This argument in no way intimates a positive     match to the evidence garment to the exclusion of all other garments.     Production numbers for textiles may be available for use in interpreting     the significance of evidence in a crime, but the examiner must     be careful to be conservative in all estimates in order to avoid     false inclusions (8). Calculating exact probability statistics     for this type of evidence is problematic at best, and professional     statisticians must be consulted before any calculations are reported     or testified.        5.5. Fiber Source       If questioned fibers     are associated with known fibers, the questioned fibers either     originated from the known textile or from another fabric source,     which not only is composed of fibers of the exact type and color     but also from a fabric that had to be available to contribute     those fibers through direct or indirect contact. The chance is,     therefore, remote to encounter fibers from the environment of     a victim that are identical to fibers from the suspects' environment     or environments in the absence of contact (9). Put another way,     the chance of finding known fibers from a randomly selected suspect     source that match the questioned fibers is remote (see endnote     3).          Back to the top          6.0.          Sample Handling        Although examiners may be     consulted concerning proper sample size, collection, or packaging,     this may not happen, and the examiner must optimize the evidence     that is submitted. Garfield (1) and others (2) list the following     methods of sampling:        6.1. Probability Sampling     (So-Called ""Random Sampling"")      Every unit in the population has a known, nonzero probability     of being included in the sample (e.g., collecting about 33 percent     of the fibers from a pillbox or by taping and mounting them);        6.2. Nonprobability or     Judgment Sampling      Every unit in the population either is or is not included in     the sample on the basis of certain characteristics it has in     common with other units of interest (e.g., mounting only red     trilobal carpet-type fibers from the victims' evidence given     the suspect has red carpet as a possible source); and        6.3. Bulk or Lot Sampling      A sampling unit is taken from a larger amount of material that     does not consist of discrete and identifiable units. Special     considerations are involved with bulk sampling, such as where     the sample is taken, how much sample is taken, and if the sample     is considered representative of the lot (e.g., cutting a swatch     from a garment for fabric and fiber examination).        Samples are adequate for     analysis when they are taken in a manner consistent with generally     recognized and accepted sampling techniques and practices within     the context of the proposed analyses. All of the previously mentioned     sampling methods have their place, and one may be more feasible     than another, given crime scene or laboratory constraints. The     examiner must be able to explain how the samples were taken and     why that procedure was used.        Examinations typically should     be conducted in the order of increasing magnification, from gross     inspection to microscopical analysis. If sample size is limited,     nondestructive methods must be exhausted before subjecting the     sample to any destructive tests (e.g., pyrolysis).        It is highly desirable that     the methods be selected in an order that provides the greatest     discrimination between samples. An exclusion precludes further     analysis, thereby maximizing the examiner's time and resources.          Back to the top          7.0. Analysis        There are three basic activities     involved in an analysis (1): (a) collection of a representative     sample; (b) preparation of the sample for analysis; and (c) analysis     using appropriate methods.        Although these activities     are ostensibly independent of each other, any one can have a     significant effect on another. Because error is possible at each     step, the examiner must be able to identify these errors and     avoid them. Any method of analysis has certain attributes such     as accuracy, precision, specificity, sensitivity, dependability,     and practicality that must be considered when choosing the most     appropriate method to adequately answer the question at hand.     Ultimately, it is the examiner's responsibility to evaluate all     of the available information and decide the level of uncertainty     that is acceptable with a given method on a given set of samples.        7.1. Physical Matches      A physical match occurs when two or more pieces of fabric or     cordage are reconstructed to prove they were previously one continuous     piece of fabric or cordage. This examination is conducted by     describing and documenting any cut, torn, or damaged edges on     questioned items and their correlation to like areas on known     items. Photography is the recommended method of documentation.        Depending upon sample size,     suitability, and exhibited characteristics, it may not be possible     to effect a positive physical match. For descriptions of physical     construction refer to the fabric and cordage guidelines in  Chapter 7  of this document.        7.2. Fiber Examinations      Fiber identifications consist of determining the generic class     of fiber type, which generally follows the Federal Trade Commission     Guidelines (3). This analysis requires a sufficient number of     examinations to unequivocally place the fiber in question into     one and only one generic class (see  Table     2 ).        Fiber comparisons consist     of determining if a questioned fiber or fibers exhibits the same     chemical, microscopic, and optical properties as fiber or fibers     comprising part or all of a known sample. A comparison requires     an examiner to complete at least two of the analytical techniques     listed for each of the following categories: generic class, physical     characteristics, and color (see  Figure     1 ). The techniques selected should independently confirm     the results obtained. It should be noted that some techniques     allow greater discrimination than others between apparently similar     samples.          Back to the top          8.0.          Report Documentation        Laboratory results should     be reported in a uniform and consistent manner. Format, units     of measurement, and accepted calculations should all be documented     in the laboratory's manuals. The contributor of the evidence     must be able to ""interpret the results and understand their     significance"" (1). The  International     Organization for Standardization (ISO)  recommends that reports     be clear, accurate, and unambiguous in the presentation of results     (4). Refer to the appropriate sections of the SWGMAT Quality     Assurance Guidelines for further information.          Back to the top          9.0. References        (1) Garfield, F. M.

GX266-77-3310990	"Care Labeling and the Textile Industr y Kay M. Villa American Textile Manufacturers Institute Ms. Villa is the Assistant Director of the American Textile Manufacturers Institute's (ATMI's) Product Ser vices Division and ser ves as the staff secretar y to the Consumer Affairs and Upholster y Fabrics Committees. She is responsible for coordinating ATMI's strategic standardization initiative under the Board of Director's Task Force on Global Competitiveness. Ms. Villa holds an M.S. in Textile Engineering and Science from North Carolina State University and degrees in Textiles and Interior Design from the University of Wisconsin.  I  'm going to talk today about care labeling and how the textile industry interfaces with that. I'm going to reserve most of my comments to talk about the new care symbol systems. I want to talk about how the industry interfaces in terms of wet cleaning. I also want to thank the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Dr. Wentz, and Ohad Jehassi for inviting the American Textile Manufacturers Institute (ATMI) to be a co-sponsor for this program. We were first aware that EPA was looking at alternative dry cleaning techniques about 4 years ago. At that time, and since then, we have been contacted twice by EPA to find out what our industry's position is on this. Basically, however, we have not been involved in this process. We have a great deal at stake and in order for you to be successful, you must engage our industry in this process. First of all, I want to talk about what ATMI is and what we represent. I also want to describe to you the fiber, textile, apparel, retail pipeline. It is a commerce stream, and it starts at one end with raw fibers--both natural fibers such as cottons and wools, and synthetic products such as nylons and polyesters. We convert them into fabrics which are handed over to an apparel manufacturer who cuts and sews the fabric into garments. The garment is then transferred downstream to the retailer who provides that product to the end consumer. ATMI represents one segment within this pipeline. We are involved in the actual manufacturing of textile products. This includes yarns, threads, fabrics, and in some cases, end products. We use techniques such as weaving, knitting, non-woven papertype production, printing, dyeing, finishing, and tufting of these fibers into textiles or fabrics. We also have members that produce products such as bandages, carpets, comforters, sheets, linens, and literally thousands of different end products. But as an association, we do not represent apparel interests. 165  There's one other issue I'd like to address here, which is some of the terminology that has been floating around. I've often heard the discussion of garment care as being fabric care and textile care. From an industry perspective, we would prefer to use the terminology ""garment and apparel care,"" because that's really what we're talking about. We're talking about a specific end product and addressing its cleaning techniques. ATMI's member companies, consume approximately 80 percent of all fibers utilized in U.S. textile operations. The gross domestic product (GDP) of this fiber, textile, and apparel pipeline is $60 billion. It is the second largest industry in the United States, following the auto industry at about $67-69 billion. The fiber industry is about $8 billion, textiles are $25 billion, and apparel is $28 billion. Textile sales in 1995 alone were $69 billion. The GDP is an integration which takes out the value added in all of those steps. Over the past 10 years, our industry has been spending approximately $2 billion annually to modernize our facilities. We're doing this for several reasons: to increase our productivity, increase our efficiency, and improve the quality of the products we're providing. We're also modernizing for a lot of environmental reasons: to reduce energy consumption, reduce water consumption, and to produce a more environmentally friendly product. When we talk about consumer labeling, I want to make you aware of the fact that the industry actually complies with four different labeling regulations. At this point, we've only discussed one, which is Trade Regulation Rules on Care Labeling of Textile Products for General Wearing Apparel and Certain Piece Goods--I will just call it the Care Labeling Act. The other two regulations that are enforced by the Federal Trade Commission include the Textile Fiber Products Identification Act (TFPIA) and the Wool Products Labeling Act. The Wool Products Labeling Act goes all   Apparel Care and the Environment  the way back to the 1930's and is essentially a consumer protection regulation. So when you go out and buy your cashmere sweater, you in fact are getting cashmere, not mohair. The other regulation that the industry deals with is one on a state level. It's called The Uniform Packaging and Labeling Regulation, and it basically deals with the physical dimensions or characteristics of products. So when you go to the grocery store and you buy a can of tomato paste, and it says that it's 8 oz. or 12 oz., that in fact is a requirement under this rule. The enforcement under that rule occurs at the state level, so state metrology or state weights and measures offices are responsible for it. Our segment of the industry, in terms of producing carpets and home furnishings products, must include dimensions to describe to the consumer what they're buying. The Care Labeling Act requires a number of different things. In fact, it requires different things of the textile industry than it does of the apparel industry. It is mandatory for apparel, but it is not required for home furnishings products. Our industry, since the promulgation of the rule in 1971, has provided care instructions to the consumer on a voluntary basis. The rule does not address industrial products. What happens in this pipeline stream is that we do not provide a permanent care label to each bolt of fabric that we sell to our customers. We typically provide that information on the invoice as the product is transferred downline. TFPIA is really a very important regulation. It's applicable to apparel and home furnishings. There are mandatory requirements. Country of origin and manufacture identification is required to be permanently attached to the product at the point of sale. Fiber type, however, is provisional. Most industry people in the United States automatically provide this on a permanent care label, but it is a voluntary option. It is an important piece of information, however, because when the consumer goes to purchase an article of clothing, their decision is made based on previous experience with the product. So when I pick out a suit in a store and it says wool, I'm going to know based on the fiber type, what I can do with this product and what the expected life of it will be. Again, as we transfer the fabrics downstream to our customers, this information is generally provided on an invoice. Now, I want to talk a little bit about ATMI in terms of how we relate to the environment. In 1992, we started a new program called Encouraging Environmental Excellence (E3). At this point in time, more than 50 percent of our members are involved in this program. What the program does is ask our members to go above and beyond local, EPA, and state environmental requirements. In our E3 1994 annual report, it talks about our 10 point program representing the minimum 166  criteria companies must meet in order to participate in the program. I think the real selling point of the program is the fact that if a member goes through this process, they've essentially qualified for International Organization for Standards (ISO) 14001, the new environmental management system standard that will come out next year. I think it's a real feather in our cap that our members have done this. The only thing that would be required for our companies to meet ISO 14001 is for an outside third-party certifier to come in and audit the books. The E3 logo is essentially a marketing program for our members to show that they in fact are a company that is committed to environmental initiatives. Some of you may have seen this logo in the L.L. Bean catalog. Now let's talk about ATMI's position on the Care Labeling Rule, with regards to the new wet and ""ecocleaning"" techniques. ATMI does support the proposal to change the rulemaking to allow the optional use of symbols to provide consumers with care instructions. Additionally, we support the dual labeling requirement to provide dry cleaning and eco options (I'm going to use eco not just wet), meaning alternative technologies, to describe to the consumers that they have these options. Our support of that is based on the provision that the requirement would only be applicable to items that normally would be dry cleaned. If it were applicable to products that would normally only be laundered it would lead to increased testing for us, increase labeling costs, and could increase the consumption of perc and other solvents. I think our E3 program demonstrates that ATMI does support eco initiatives. We do have some concerns about the potential of moving forward with these new technologies because these technologies have not been used with the pipeline of products that are out there. If the consumer has the idea that they can just take any of their clothing out of their closet and take it to a local Greener Cleaner, we would expect to see more damage claims. We would expect to see problems including shrinkage, color loss, dye transfer, color bleeding, felting of wools, stiffness in some fabrics, and water stains and water marks. I was very interested in the comments that were provided yesterday, both on the Greener Cleaner project in Chicago and in Germany, and I'm very pleased to hear that there are now up to 31,000 garments that have been tested with this new technology. We need more testing. The 31,000 samples that have been tested are minuscule compared to the 12 billion garments that are sold in the United States annually. Yesterday, Dr. Josef Kurz told us about research being carried out in Germany. He indicated that approximately 200 million garments are cleaned annu-   Care Labeling and the Textile Industr y  ally. Please note that these 200 million garments only represent slightly over one and a half percent of the U.S. annual market. The German experience is a very good example, but it does not automatically correlate to the size and scope of the U.S. marketplace. The industry will not be able to automatically modify our product, or reformulate to meet the rigors of these new cleaning technologies.That would include our spinning operations, how we take fiber and spin it to make it into yarn, how we take those yarns and then convert them into woven goods or knit goods. It would include how we scour, that is, how we clean the fabric before we prepare it for adding dyes and finishes. The technology that exists in the textile industry today is based on 300 years of product development. A lot of that product development has come over the last 50 years with the advent of a number of synthetic products and synthetic fibers. That doesn't mean that we won't change, but I'm not going to stand up here and say that our industry is automatically going to accept all of this and reformulate our products. I also want to emphasize that, as we discussed yesterday, just because a product can be eco cleaned does not necessarily guarantee that the manufacturing  processes that went into the development of that end product were done in an environmentally friendly manner. So we have to be able to weigh these options. If it's more important on one end, what does it mean we give up on the other end? I also want to stress the kind of time line that we're talking of in terms of taking fibers from one end of the pipeline and getting it down to the end consumer. Normally, most textile operations can take anywhere from 6 to 18 months to transfer the raw fiber to the end product that goes to the consumer. It will require a very large amount of time for the industry to make modifications. In some cases, it might be an easy fix; it might be something the company can do within a 2-month period of time to reformulate to develop a better product. But in some cases, we may never be able to find a solution that will take every single fiber, every single product and guarantee that it can be cleaned with these new technologies. The other major factor that will really drive whether or not we are all successful is whether the consumer will accept the end product that comes out of the pipeline stream.  167   Apparel Care and the Environment  1  Care Labeling and the Textile Industry Apparel Care and the Environment: Alternative Technologies and Labeling September 9-10, 1996  2  This is ATMI q Manufacturing q Techniques q End Products  168   Care Labeling and the Textile Industr y  3  This is ATMI q Membership represents 80% of fiber consumption q GDP > $60 B q Modernization - $2 B  4  Consumer Labeling Rules and Regulations Textiles and Apparel Required To Meet Four Rules q Care Labeling Act q Textile Fiber Products Identification Act (TFPIA) q Uniform Packaging and Labeling Regulation (NCWM) q Wool Products Labeling Act  169   Apparel Care and the Environment  5  Care Labeling Act Promulgated in 1971 q Labeling Requirements for Product Disclosure to the Consumer s s s s  Apparel--Mandatory Home Furnishings--Voluntary Industrial--No Requirements Upstream Manufacturers Supply Care Instructions Via Invoice  6  TFPIA Promulgated in 1950s q Products s  Apparel and Home Furnishings Fiber Type, Country of Origin, and Manufacturer 's Identification  q Product Information s  q Manufacturer 's Supply Information Via Invoice  170   Care Labeling and the Textile Industr y  7  ATMI and the Environment Encouraging Environmental Excellence Program Promulgated in 1992 q > 50% of ATMI Members Enrolled q Company Programs Exceed EPA, State, and Local Requirements  8  ATMI and the Environment Encouraging Environmental Excellence Program Promulgated in 1992 q Environmental Management 10 Point Program q E3 Members Meet ISO 14001  171   Apparel Care and the Environment  9  ATMI and Care Labeling q Support Current FTC Rulemaking To Change Care Labeling Act  10  ATMI and Care Labeling q Support Dual Labeling of Dryclean and Eco-Clean Systems s  Should Apply Only to Products Normally Drycleaned  172   Care Labeling and the Textile Industr y  11  Implementation of Eco Cleaning Systems q ATMI Supports Eco-Initiatives q More Damages Seen if Customers Perceive that Methods Work for All Products  12  Implementation of Eco Cleaning Systems Limitations q Industry cannot Automatically ""Turn Over"" or Modify Products s  New Cleaning Methods Require New Formulations  173   Apparel Care and the Environment  13  Implementation of Eco Cleaning Systems Limitations q Fiber, Textile, and Apparel Retail Pipelines s  6 to 18 Months Minimum of Several Years  q Phase-In Time Required by Industry s  174"

To date the errors appear to be quite small as long as the prediction is for inputs within the range of those used in the training of the neural network. The accuracy degrades noticeably when trying to predict performance for inputs which are out of the range used in training. Additional testing with the spinning model will be conducted during the next quarter. As the other plaht models become functional, neural nets will be developed and trained for them as well. In addition we shall compare neural nets versus response surfaces as to ease of development and accuracy of prediction. 7.

Summary:  A paper on the modeling project was presented at a workshop on manufacturing innovations held at McGill University in Montreal on June 29-30. This paper has also been accepted for publication in the International Journal of Clothing Science and Technology.  We have made significant progress on all individual projects and are bringing several to a point of completion for the graduate students theses. On another front, the CIM team students and faculty - hosted a future search workshop on CIM in the Fiber-Textile-Apparel Complex. This workshop, sponsored by Duke Power, brought 40 international thought leaders from all phases of the textile, textile machinery, sensors and controllers, and computer hardware and software industries together to undertake a ""whole-system"" reshaping of the capability for CIM to change the competitive capability of the domestic industry. We created a temporary community for one week which included students and faculty to open up possibility thinking and then to focus on specific recommendations with actions proposed by launch teams. The conference was highly successful in meeting the objectives, particularly in defining the elements of a paradigm shift. A full report will be published this Fall.

Different spinning technologies were used to make 210 yarn samples from the above card sliver. Linear density and tensile properties of all yams were measured. A fabric was knitted from each yarn sample. The fabric was then dyed and the color measured. In addition, the surface friction, surface roughness, shear, and bending rigidity of each fabric was measured. This yam and fabric property data will be used to evaluate yarn performance in subsequent processes. A Total Quality-Computer Integrated Management System - Continuing literary research for CIM and TQM. Have  written a literary review comparing and contrasting TQM and CIM philosophies.

Knitted Fabric Inspection and Monitoring - Developed a Data Collection and Control/2 program that can receive and interpret signals from the knitting machine through the hardware interface. Completed a paper on the barriers to the implementation of CIM. Also visited several circular knitting facilities and interviewed plant personnel to collect data to develop an accurate information model of the ""generic"" knitting facility. Currently developing data flow diagrams of this information model. One major textile company is very excited about working with us in completing model development and applying it to their operation. CIM in Wet-Laid Nonwovens - This project is nearing completion with the drafting of the thesis. We have modified the design of automation for the wet-lay process and have completed development of the PlantWorks application which will monitor and control this process. We also prepared and presented a paper at the Fundamental Research Conference. Analysis of Loom Stops - This project is nearing completion with the drafting of the thesis. We have completed the data collection and analysis of variable loom speed data and are working with industry to obtain constant loom speed data. we have completed a literary survey and are currently writing a review. Adaptive Loom Control for Slashing Defects - Currently, we are running experiments and collecting data on 18Ne cotton yarn to help correlate sizing defects to the loom stop level. Also, we are modeling and validating simulation models on weave room efficiency. Based on this information, a paper is being written on predicting weaving efficiency taking into account the frequency of loom stops and repair time.  We are reviewing existing instruments which detect yarn faults on the loom. CIM and Fiber Formation - We are continuing to develop a process model to predict the resulting properties of as-spun fibers. We are developing a theoretical model which maps information necessary to understand how one or more process parameters can affect one or more material parameters.

Persons with disabilities who require this request for comment in an alternative means of communication (Braille, large print, audiotape, etc.) should contact the USDA Target Center at (202) 720-2600 (voice and TDD).    SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: USDA is preparing to establish the FY 2001 TRQs for both raw cane sugar that may be entered under subheading 1701.11.10 of the HTS and certain sugars, syrups and molasses that may be entered under subheadings 1701.12.10, 1701.91.10, 1701.99.10, 1702.90.10, and 2106.90.44 of the HTS (i.e., the refined sugar TRQ).        USDA is not proposing a specific administrative approach for the raw cane or refined sugar TRQs at this time. However, interested parties may wish to consider the following factors when preparing comments: (1) In accordance with its international obligations under the World Trade Organization, USDA must establish a raw cane sugar TRQ of not less than 1,117,195 metric tons raw value and a refined sugar TRQ of not less than 22,000 metric tons raw value as provided for in Additional U.S. Note 5(a)(i) of the HTS; (2) In order for USDA to offer non-recourse support loans, the Federal Agriculture Improvement and   Reform Act of 1996 requires the TRQ for imports of sugar to be established at, or increased to, a level in excess of 1,500,000 short tons raw value during the fiscal year; and (3) USDA proposes establishing the specialty sugar allocation at 14,656 metric tons,   which will result in a refined sugar TRQ of at least 35,000 metric tons.

GX236-24-10816421	54276  Federal Register / Vol. 64, No. 193 / Wednesday, October 6, 1999 / Notices Whales) to review and comment on the research pertinent to this decision to delist gray whales, as required under section 4(g) of the ESA. Effective June 16, 1994 (59 FR 31094), as a result of NMFS' determination, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) removed this whale stock from the List under the ESA. Concurrent with that action, NMFS amended the list of endangered species under its jurisdiction (50 CFR part 222), removing the Eastern North Pacific gray whale stock. Abundance and trends in the population's growth were sufficient to allow this stock to be removed from the List without going through an interim consideration period as a threatened stock. Changes to the listing of the Eastern North Pacific gray whale stock did not affect the fact that the Western North Pacific (``Korean'') gray whale stock has not recovered and should continue to be considered endangered. A workshop was convened by NMFS at NMML in Seattle, Washington, on March 1617, 1999, to review the status of the Eastern North Pacific stock of gray whales based on research conducted during the 5-year period following the delisting of this stock. The workshop followed guidelines outlined in the NMFS 5-year Plan to conduct the status review and recommend whether to (1) continue the monitoring program for an additional 5-year period; (2) terminate the monitoring program; or (3) consider changing the status of the gray whale under the ESA. The 28 invited participants determined that this stock was neither in danger of extinction, nor was it likely to again become endangered within the foreseeable future, according to the determining factors listed in section 4(a)(1) of the ESA. Therefore, there was no apparent reason to reverse the previous decision to delist this stock from the List. There was a consensus among participants that this stock of gray whales should continue to be monitored for an additional 5-year period (19992004). Canada's Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada lists the ``Northeast Pacific population'' of gray whale as ``not at risk.'' This is the lowest category for animals in their classification system, which also includes vulnerable, threatened, endangered, extirpated, and extinct. Although the Eastern North Pacific stock of gray whales no longer receives protection under the ESA, it continues to be protected under the MMPA, and subsistence take is managed under quotas set by the International Whaling Commission. The delisting of this stock does not in any way alter the status of the still endangered Western North Pacific (``Korean'') stock of gray whales. There is no allowable commercial take of any gray whales, and the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species regulates the transportation of animal parts. Furthermore, if there is evidence of a significant negative decline and research indicates that such a change would be warranted, this stock can be proposed to be listed again as threatened or endangered under the ESA. This review concludes the 5-year status review required by section 4(g)(1) of the ESA, that commenced on June 16, 1994 (59 FR 31094), when the USFWS removed this whale stock from the List.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.; the MMPA), NMFS has jurisdiction over most marine mammal species, including whales. Under section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.; the ESA) and 50 CFR part 424, NMFS makes determinations as to whether a species should be listed as endangered or threatened, or whether it should be reclassified or removed from the List. Accordingly, NMFS has conducted comprehensive evaluations of the status of the Eastern North Pacific gray whale stock. The first review was conducted in 1984, followed by another review in 1990 (56 FR 29471, June 27, 1991). These evaluations were conducted in terms of factors contained in section 4(a)(1) of the ESA for listing and delisting actions. The best available abundance estimate (21,296; CV = 6.05%; 95% CI = 18,900 to 24,000) and average annual rate of increase (3.29%; SE = 0.44%) indicated that this stock no longer met the standards for classification as an endangered species. An extensive public comment period was provided (56 FR 58869, November 22, 1991). On 7 January 1993 (58 FR 3121), NMFS published a final notice of determination that this whale stock had recovered to near its estimated preexploitation population size. Although individual and cumulative impacts might have the potential to adversely affect these whales, it was determined that this stock was neither in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range, nor was it likely to again become endangered within the foreseeable future. NMFS determined, therefore, that the Eastern North Pacific stock of gray whales should no longer be considered endangered. On June 3, 1994, NMFS announced the availability of a draft plan (A 5-year Plan for Research and Monitoring of the Eastern North Pacific Population of Gray  CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION Proposed Collection; Comment Request--Collection of Information for Children's Sleepwear : Consumer Product Safety Commission.

The Commission staff estimates that these standards and implementing regulations will impose an average annual burden of about 1,650 hours on each of those firms. That burden will result from conducting the testing required by the standards and maintaining records of the results of that testing required by the implementing regulations. The total annual burden imposed by the standards and regulations on all manufacturers and importers of children's sleepwear will be about 103,950 hours. The hourly wage for the testing and recordkeeping required by the standards and regulations is about $30, for an annual cost to the industry of about $3,118,500. The Commission will expend approximately three months of professional staff time and travel costs annually for reviewing and evaluating the records maintained by manufacturers and importers of children's sleepwear subject to the standards. The annual cost to the Federal government of the collection of information in the sleepwear standards and implementing regulations is estimated to be $17,000. C. Request for Comments The Commission solicits written comments from all interested persons about the proposed collection of information. The Commission specifically solicits information relevant to the following topics: --Whether the collection of information described above is necessary for the proper performance of the Commission's functions, including whether the information would have practical utility; --Whether the estimated burden of the proposed collection of information is accurate; --Whether the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected could be enhanced; and --Whether the burden imposed by the collection of information could be minimized by use of automated, electronic or other technological  collection techniques, or other forms of information technology.

ACTION: Notice. AGENCY  A. The Standards Children's sleepwear in sizes 0 through 6X manufactured for sale in or imported into the United States is subject to the Standard for the Flammability of Children's Sleepwear: Sizes 0 through 6X (16 CFR Part 1615). Children's sleepwear in sizes 7 through 14 is subject to the Standard for the Flammability of Children's Sleepwear: Sizes 7 through 14 (16 CFR Part 1616). The children's sleepwear flammability standards require that fabrics, seams, and trim used in children's sleepwear in sizes 0 through 14 must self-extinguish when exposed to a small open-flame ignition source. The children's sleepwear standards and implementing regulations also require manufacturers and importers of children's sleepwear in sizes 0 through 14 to perform testing of products and to maintain records of the results of that testing. 16 CFR Part 1615, Subpart B; 16 CFR Part 1616; Subpart B. The Commission uses the information compiled and maintained by manufacturers and importers of children's sleepwear to help protect the public from risks of death or burn injuries associated with children's sleepwear. More specifically, the Commission reviews this information to determine whether the products produced and imported by the firms comply with the applicable standard. Additionally, the Commission uses this information to arrange corrective actions if items of children's sleepwear fail to comply with the applicable standard in a manner that creates a substantial risk of injury to the public. OMB approved the collection of information in the children's sleepwear standards and implementing regulations  : The Strategic Advisory Group (SAG) will meet in closed session on October 21 and 22, 1999. The mission of the SAG is to provide timely advice on scientific, technical, and policyrelated issues to the Commander in Chief, U.S. Strategic Command, during the development of the nation's strategic war plans. At this meeting, the SAG will discuss strategic issues that relate to the development of the Single Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP). Full development of the topics will require discussion of information classified TOP SECRET in accordance with Executive Order 12958, April 17, 1995. Access to this information must be strictly limited to personnel having requisite security clearances and specific need-to know. Unauthorized disclosure of the information to be discussed at the SAG meeting could have exceptionally grave impact upon national defense. In accordance with section 10(d) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, (5 U.S.C. App. 2), it has been determined that this SAG meeting concerns matters listed in 5 USC 552b(c) and that, accordingly, this meeting will be closed to the public. SUMMARY  Dated: September 30, 1999.

C-3738  COMPLAINT The Federal Trade Commission, having reason to Zale Corporation, a corporation (""respondent""), has provisions of the Federal Trade Commission Act, and to the Commission that a proceeding by it in respect would be in the public interest, alleges: believe that violated the it appearing thereof  1. Respondent Zale Corporation is a Delaware corporation with its principal office or place of business at 901 W. Walnut Hill Lane, Irving, Texas 75038. 2. Respondent operates the country's largest chain of retail jewelry stores with more than 1,200 locations throughout the United States, Guam, and Puerto Rico. 3. Respondent has manufactured, advertised, labeled, offered Ocean Treasures line of for sale, sold, and distributed the imitation pearl jewelry, and numerous other lines of cultured pearl jewelry, to the public. These lines of jewelry have included bracelets, earrings, pendants, rings and strands. None of respondent s jewelry products has included natural pearls. 4. Federal Trade Commission ind ustry guides are administrative interpretations of laws administered by the Commission for the guidance of the public in conducting its affairs in conformity with legal requirements. The Federal Trade Commission s Guides for the Jewelry, Precious Metals, and Pewter Industries, 16 C.F.R. Part 23, 61 F.R. 27212 (May 30, 1996), state as follows:   A. 23.2 Misleading Illustrations. It is unfair or deceptive to use, as part of any advertisement, packaging material, label, or other sales promotion matter, any visual representation, picture, televised or computer image, illustration, diagram, or other depiction which, either alone or in conjunction with any accompanying words or phrases, misrepresents the type, kind, grade, quality, quantity, metallic content, size, weight, cut, color, character, treatment, substance, durability, serviceability, origin, preparation, production, manufacture, distribution, or any other material aspect of an industry product. 23.20 Misuse of terms such as ""cultured pearl,"" B. ""seed pearl,"" ""Oriental pearl,"" ""natura,"" ""kultured,"" ""real,"" ""gem,"" ""synthetic,"" and regional designations. It is unfair or deceptive to use the term ""cultured pearl,"" ""cultivated pearl,"" or any other word, term, or phrase of like meaning to describe, identify, or refer to any imitation pearl. 23.19 Misuse of the word ""pearl."" (c) It is unfair C. or deceptive to use the word ""pearl"" to describe, identify, or refer to an imitation pearl unless it is immediately preceded, with equal conspicuousness, by the word ""artificial,"" ""imitation,"" or ""simulated,"" or by some other word or phrase of like meaning, so as to indicate definitely and clearly that the product is not a pearl. 5. The acts and practices of respondent alleged in this complaint have been in or affecting commerce, as ""commerce"" is defined in Section 4 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. 6. Respondent has disseminated or has caused to be disseminated advertisements for its Ocean Treasures imitation pearl jewelry products, including but not necessarily limited to the attached Exhibits A through B. These advertisements contain the following statements and depictions: 1. ""ZALES THE DIAMOND, SEMI-PRECIOUS AND PEARL STORE Ocean Treasures TM Fine Jewelry Created by nature, enhanced by man."" [Depictions of necklace, earrings, rings, and pendants, all of which appear to contain pearls or cultured pearls](Exhibit A) ""Ocean TreasuresTM Fine Jewelry Created by nature, enhanced by man."" [Depictions of necklace, earrings, and pendant, all of which appear to contain pearls or cultured pearls] (Exhibit B) TM  2.   7. Through the means described in Paragraph 6, respondent has represented, expressly or by implication, that the Ocean Treasures line of jewelry is composed of cultured pearls. 8. In truth and in fact, the Ocean Treasures line of jewelry is not composed of cultured pearls, but rather is composed exclusively of imitation pearls. A cultured pearl is a pearl formed by a mollusk as a result of an irritant placed in the mollusk s shell by humans. An imitation pearl is a manufactured product that is designed to simulate in appearance a pearl or cultured pearl. Therefore, the representation set forth in Paragraph 7 was, and is, false or misleading. 9. The acts and practices of respondent as alleged in this complaint constitute unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. THEREFORE, the Federal Trade Commission this twenty-eighth day of April, 1997, has issued this complaint against respondent. By the Commission.  Donald S.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) plans to hold four public meetings to discuss how we should administer our imported fire ant program in light of reduced funding.     Our imported fire ant program is based on our imported fire ant regulations (7 CFR 301.81-1 through 301.81-10, referred to below as the regulations). The regulations govern the interstate movement of regulated articles from areas quarantined because of imported fire ant. Section 301.81-2 of the regulations provides a list of articles regulated because of imported fire ant. Regulated articles are imported fire ant queens and reproducing colonies of imported fire ants, soil (except potting soil shipped in its original container), baled hay or straw stored in direct contact with the ground, nursery stock (except plants maintained indoors in a home or office environment and not for sale), used soil-moving equipment, and any other article determined to present a risk of spreading imported fire ant. Section 301.81-3 of the regulations lists areas quarantined because of imported fire ant. Quarantined areas are all or portions of the following States and territories: Alabama, Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas. Sections 301.81-4 through 301.81-10 provide requirements for moving regulated articles interstate from quarantined areas to nonquarantined areas. These sections include requirements for certificates and limited permits and for treatment of regulated articles.     For fiscal year (FY) 2000, Congress gave APHIS $100,000 to cover the costs of administering the imported fire ant program and directed APHIS to use $58,000 of that amount to administer the program in New Mexico. Although $100,000 is considerably less than the amount allotted to the program for FY 1999, this amount is actually more than APHIS requested. For several years, APHIS has sought to eliminate its imported fire ant control activities because no economical, environmentally acceptable control agents specific to imported fire ant are available for large-scale application on agricultural land. Also, APHIS has not received any requests from States for cooperative treatment programs since 1985. In past years, APHIS has provided States with technical knowledge, treatment guidelines, and regulatory guidelines to help control imported fire ant populations; the States have conducted regulatory and survey activities. Through this arrangement, States have maintained a strong regulatory program and have even eradicated small, isolated infestations outside quarantined areas.     In support of these efforts to control imported fire ant, APHIS successfully tested the insecticide fipronil in FY 1998. Fipronil would be used to treat nursery stock and grass sod moving interstate from quarantined areas. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is currently reviewing this insecticide; it may be registered by the EPA for use in the spring of 2001. APHIS plans to continue to evaluate the efficacy of new regulatory treatments for imported fire ant under its plant methods development laboratories? budget line item.     The public meetings will provide an opportunity for interested persons to comment on whether APHIS should continue to administer the imported fire ant program in accordance with the regulations (and if so, how we should manage the program in light of current funding) or if we should pursue another course of action. Please note, however, that while the information gathered during the meetings may indicate the need for changes to our current regulatory program, the meetings will not directly result in any changes to the regulations. If we determine that changes to the regulations are appropriate, we will propose those changes in the Federal Register.  Issues      We have identified three potential courses of action with respect to the imported fire ant program. They are:     (1) Maintain our imported fire ant program with minimal Federal regulatory activity, in line with current funding.     This option would, through APHIS regulations, continue to provide uniform standards for the regulated industry and consistent interstate shipping requirements. Under this option, States would continue to enforce the Federal quarantine without Federal funding. When alerted by States, APHIS personnel would continue to investigate noncompliance with the regulations and examine the origin and pathway of introduction of imported fire ants found on regulated articles.     (2) Eliminate the imported fire ant regulations (i.e., rescind the Federal quarantine) and develop model guidelines for States to use in harmonizing their quarantines.     This option would reduce Federal resource requirements and may provide uniformity without Federal regulation. However, in the absence of Federal regulations, States may independently impose more or less stringent requirements for the entry of currently regulated articles. Requirements could differ from State to State.     (3) Eliminate the imported fire ant regulations (i.e., rescind the Federal quarantine) and establish a voluntary nursery self- certification program.     This option would also reduce Federal resource requirements and may provide uniformity without Federal regulation. However, a voluntary self-certification program is not a mandatory program and could, therefore, result in less than 100 percent participation by producers.     Comments on these, or any other options, are welcome during the public meetings.  Meeting Procedures/Registration      A representative of APHIS will preside at each public meeting. Any interested person may appear and be heard in person, by attorney, or by another representative. Written statements may be submitted and will be made part of the meeting record. Persons who wish to speak at a meeting will be asked to provide their names and organizations. We ask that anyone who reads a statement or submits a written statement provide two copies to the presiding officer at the meeting.     Registration for each public meeting will take place from 8:30 a.m. to 9 a.m. on the day of the meeting at the meeting room. Each public meeting will begin at 9 a.m. and is scheduled to end at 5 p.m., local time. However, any meeting may end at any time after it begins if all persons desiring to speak have been heard. If the number of speakers at a meeting warrants it, the presiding officer may limit the time for presentations so that everyone wishing to speak has the opportunity.  Written Comments      If you cannot attend a public meeting, you may submit written comments on the issues raised in this notice. To submit written comments, please follow the instructions listed under the heading ADDRESSES near the beginning of this document.

Please note, however, that while the information gathered during the meetings may indicate the need for changes to our current regulatory program, the meetings will not directly result in any changes to the regulations. If we determine that changes to the regulations are appropriate, we will propose those changes in the Federal Register.  Issues      We have identified three potential courses of action with respect to the imported fire ant program. They are:     (1) Maintain our imported fire ant program with minimal Federal regulatory activity, in line with current funding.     This option would, through APHIS regulations, continue to provide uniform standards for the regulated industry and consistent interstate shipping requirements. Under this option, States would continue to enforce the Federal quarantine without Federal funding. When alerted by States, APHIS personnel would continue to investigate noncompliance with the regulations and examine the origin and pathway of introduction of imported fire ants found on regulated articles.     (2) Eliminate the imported fire ant regulations (i.e., rescind the Federal quarantine) and develop model guidelines for States to use in harmonizing their quarantines.     This option would reduce Federal resource requirements and may provide uniformity without Federal regulation. However, in the absence of Federal regulations, States may independently impose more or less stringent requirements for the entry of currently regulated articles. Requirements could differ from State to State.     (3) Eliminate the imported fire ant regulations (i.e., rescind the Federal quarantine) and establish a voluntary nursery self- certification program.     This option would also reduce Federal resource requirements and may provide uniformity without Federal regulation. However, a voluntary self-certification program is not a mandatory program and could, therefore, result in less than 100 percent participation by producers.     Comments on these, or any other options, are welcome during the public meetings.  Meeting Procedures/Registration      A representative of APHIS will preside at each public meeting. Any interested person may appear and be heard in person, by attorney, or by another representative. Written statements may be submitted and will be made part of the meeting record. Persons who wish to speak at a meeting will be asked to provide their names and organizations. We ask that anyone who reads a statement or submits a written statement provide two copies to the presiding officer at the meeting.     Registration for each public meeting will take place from 8:30 a.m. to 9 a.m. on the day of the meeting at the meeting room. Each public meeting will begin at 9 a.m. and is scheduled to end at 5 p.m., local time. However, any meeting may end at any time after it begins if all persons desiring to speak have been heard. If the number of speakers at a meeting warrants it, the presiding officer may limit the time for presentations so that everyone wishing to speak has the opportunity.  Written Comments      If you cannot attend a public meeting, you may submit written comments on the issues raised in this notice. To submit written comments, please follow the instructions listed under the heading ADDRESSES near the beginning of this document.

Site Map              Search                                   Textile Operations Overview   The textile industry is comprised of a diverse, fragmented group of establishments that produce and/or process textile-related products (fiber, yarn, fabric) for further processing into apparel, home furnishings and industrial goods. Textile establishments receive and prepare fibers; transform fibers into yarn, thread or webbing; convert the yarn into fabric or related products; and dye and finish these materials at various stages of production.   The process of converting raw fibers into finished apparel and non-apparel textile products is complex; thus, most textile mills specialize. Little overlap occurs between knitting and weaving, or among production of manmade, cotton and wool fabrics. Textiles generally go through three to four stages of production that may include yarn formation, fabric formation, wet processing and textile fabrication.  The flow diagram below shows some of the general steps in which fibers are processed to manufacture textile goods.                  The following table provides a listing of some of the waste streams that may be generated at each level of textile processing.

GX045-83-9083820	TEKTRAN   EFFECT OF WHOLE CELLULASE ON THE SUPRAMOLECULAR STRUCTURE OF COTTON CELLULOSE      Author(s):    ROUSSELLE  MARIE A                 BERTONIERE  NOELIE R               HOWLEY  PHYLLIS S                  GOYNES JR  WILTON R                      Interpretive Summary:    In commercial textile processing, cotton fabrics are frequently treated     with enzymes to improve their appearance.  Enzymes can give the appearance  of stone-washed denim without having to use stones, can produce a smooth    surface by removing fuzzy fibers, or can improve color uniformity of dyed   fabrics.  Such treatments are very mild and have been very successful       commercially.  In this study, cotton fabric that had been desized, scoured  and bleached in the usual manner was treated with a commercial textile      cellulase for 10, 60 and 180 minutes in stainless steel canisters           containing stainless steel ball bearings.  Changes in fabric weight,        fabric strength, appearance of fibers when examined by a microscope,        moisture regain, molecular weight of the cellulose, the size of pores in    the fibers, and hydrogen bonding patterns in the cellulose are compared.    These results can help industry optimize their use of cellulases to give    the desired effects while minimizing undesired side effects, and can help   other researchers understand how cellulases act on cotton fabrics.

GX034-83-0384935	TEKTRAN   INTENSIFICATION OF ENZYMATIC PROCESSING OF TEXTILES BY ULTRASOUND      Author(s):    YACHMENEV  VALERIY                 BERTONIERE  NOELIE R               BLANCHARD  EUGENE J                      Interpretive Summary:    The goal of the cotton preparation process is to remove hydrophobic         noncellulosic components and produce highly absorbent fiber that can be     dyed and finished uniformly. Currently, these noncellulosics on cotton      fibers are solubilized and removed by conventional alkaline scouring with   sodium hydroxide solution at the boil. This preparation process requires    large quantities of water and energy and generates a significant amount of  highly alkaline wastewater. In this study we show that the combination of   enzymatic bio-preparation and ultrasound could greatly reduce the amount of wastewater effluent, energy consumption and overall preparation costs.      Introduction of ultrasonic energy in the reaction chamber during enzymatic  treatment of cotton fabric resulted in significant improvement in the       performance of the enzymes, but it did not contribute to a decrease in      tensile strength of the fabric. The combination of ultrasound with          enzymatic treatment of cotton textiles offers significant advantages such   as less consumption of enzymes, shorter processing time, less fiber damage  and better uniformity of treatment. Groups benefiting from this development include the enzyme producers, the textile industry, industrial and academic textile scientists and the consumer.

DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE  Foreign Agricultural Service     Notice of Request for Extension of a Currently Approved Information Collection     AGENCY:  Foreign Agricultural Service, USDA.     ACTION:  Notice and request for comments.          SUMMARY : In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, this notice announces that the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) intends to request an extension for a currently approved information collection procedure for entry of specialty sugars into the United States as described in 7 CFR Part 2011.     DATES:  Comments should be received on or before September 18, 2001, to be assured of consideration.     ADDRESSES:  Mail or deliver comments to Richard J. Blabey, Director, Import Policies and Programs Division, Foreign Agricultural Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Stop 1021, 1400 Independence Ave., SW., Washington, DC 20250-1021, (202) 720-2916.     FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:  Richard J. Blabey, at the address above, or telephone at (202) 720-2916, or e-mail at   Blabey@fas.usda.gov .    SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:      Title: Specialty Sugar Import Certificates.      OMB Number: 0551-0025.      Expiration Date of Approval: September 30, 2001.      Type of Request: Extension of a currently approved information collection.    Abstract: The quota system established by Presidential Proclamation 4941 of May 5, 1982, prevented the importation of certain sugars used for specialized purposes which originated in countries which did not have quota allocations. Therefore, the regulation at 15 CFR part 2011 (Allocation of Tariff-Rate Quota on Imported Sugars, Syrups and Molasses, subpart B--Specialty Sugar) established terms and conditions under which certificates are issued permitting U.S. importers holding certificates to enter specialty sugars from specialty sugar source countries under the sugar tariff-rate quotas (TRQ). Nothing in this subpart affects the ability to enter specialty sugars at the over-TRQ duty rates. Applicants for certificates for the import of specialty sugars must supply the information required by 15 CFR 2011.205 to be eligible to receive a specialty sugar certificate. The specific information required on an application must be collected from those who wish to participate in the program in order to grant specialty sugar certificates, ensure that imported specialty sugar does not disrupt the current domestic sugar program, and administer the issuance of the certificates effectively.      Estimate of Burden: Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 2 hours per response.      Respondents: Importers.      Estimated Number of Respondents: 30.      Estimated Number of Responses per Respondent: 1.      Estimated Total Annual Burden on Respondents: 60 hours.      Copies of this information collection can be obtained from Kimberly Chisley, the Agency Information Collection Coordinator, at (202) 720-2568.    Request for Comments        The public is invited to submit comments and suggestions to the above address regarding the accuracy of the burden estimate, ways to minimize the burden, including through the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of the information technology, or any other aspect of this collection of information. Comments on the issues covered by the Paperwork Reduction Act are most useful to OMB if received within 30 days of publication of the Notice and Request for Comments, but must be submitted no later than 60 days from the date of publication to be assured of consideration. All responses to this notice will be summarized and included in the request for OMB approval. All comments will also become a matter of public record. Persons with disabilities who require an alternative means for communication of information (Braille, large print, audiotape, etc.) should contact the USDA Target Center at (202) 720-2600 (voice and TDD).        Signed at Washington, DC, on July 5, 2001.
