The Task Force reviewed relevant UW documents and also looked at plans and practices in other universities. In 2004 the Task Force surveyed library staff in order to identify issues of diversity important to the staff and identify areas that need attention or improvement. Survey results showed diversity is important to our staff, and that the most important issue is being able to support our diverse user community effectively (Appendix 1). However, the staff also perceives that the Libraries can do a better job in addressing diversity issues, especially in recruiting a diverse work force and in supporting the needs of our diverse user community.      At the same time the LibrariesDiversity Task Force was working on the survey and plan, the University of Washington was conducting a Diversity Appraisal. The Appraisal Steering Committee asked all units across all three campuses to document their diversity initiatives and practices. The Diversity Appraisal is just one of many ways the UW administration is seeking to incorporate greater awareness of diversity issues into University operations. It is within this culture of diversity awareness that the LibrariesTask Force has written this plan.       The University of Washington defines diversity broadly to include ace, gender, disability, class, sexual identity/orientation, religion, age, ethnicity, culture, region/geography, and indigenous status.  Respect for all human diversity is a fundamental value of the Libraries and is identified among the core values of our strategic plan. Staff members who appreciate different backgrounds and perspectives provide us with a competitive advantage as we approach problem solving and planning for services. This appreciation also allows us to serve our increasingly diverse communities more effectively and with more sensitivity.       Beyond respect for diversity, it is important to recognize that inequity can often accompany diversity. This plan is meant to foster and support an organizational culture where those inequities do not occur or are remedied when identified.      Libraries personnel at all levels of the organization are responsible for developing and maintaining a culture supportive of and committed to diversity. However, in order to expedite implementation of the plan and provide support and guidance, the Diversity Task Force recommends that the establishment of a Diversity Officer position and a standing Diversity Committee be the first actions taken (see Goal #5). The Diversity Officer and Committee should begin action on the ithin 6 monthsitems immediately as they are of the highest priority. The remaining action items where implementation is recommended within twelve months should be prioritized by the Committee. Where funds and workload implications of others are incurred in the execution of the Plan, the responsible party(ies) will develop a plan.     Recruitment of staff from diverse backgrounds          Goal: To increase the diversity of the Librariesworkforce at all levels of the organization                    Action Items:              Implementation: Diversity Officer; Diversity Committee; Administrative Officer Responsible for Personnel (AORP); Staff Development      Within 6 Months    Review our recruitment policies and procedures so that they support the UW Libraries commitment to diversity Initiate a conversation between the iSchool Diversity Committee and the Libraries Diversity Committee to explore collaboration Investigate the costs and effectiveness of residency programs for minority librarians and develop a proposal if appropriate (2005-2006)     Within 12 Months    Establish mentoring program for staff who may want to pursue a library degree, collaborating with the i-School Work with the University to take advantage of hiring opportunities that promote a diverse Libraries staff Proactively promote UW Libraries as a place in which to work Establish opportunities for students interested in working in libraries as a career to participate in mentored work programs       Retention of staff from diverse backgrounds       Goal: Promote an inclusive and supportive workplace culture as an important element in retaining a diverse staff        Action Items:        Within 12 Months    Support opportunities for professional development and/or growth, and mentoring/networking for all staff        Implementation: Diversity Officer; Diversity Committee; Libraries Council; Staff Development; Librarian Advisory Program (LAP) Facilitate connections between new hires and groups/resources at the university and in the community    Implementation: Diversity Committee; Diversity Officer; Staff Development Officer, UL Staff Work with the University to enhance salary and compensation flexibility to retain a diverse library staff    Implementation: Dean of the Libraries; AORP       Organizational Culture       Goal: To incorporate awareness of the value and importance of diversity at all levels of the Libraries so that staff recognize their responsibility in maintaining a culture supportive of and committed to diversity; provide a supportive and safe working and learning environment      Action Items:        Implementation: Diversity Officer; Diversity Committee; Staff Development        Within 6 months    Provide ongoing staff training to foster individual responsibility for maintenance of a supportive and safe working and learning environment, with particular attention to the role of supervisors and managers to eliminate or remedy inequities when they are identified Highlight and promote the diversity of the libraries staff through programs and publications throughout the organization, i.e. Inforum, Library Directions, and LSA Enhance the Staff Development collection with diversity related materials including academic librarianship, higher education and organizational development       Services to Constituents       Goal: To enrich the quality of life and advance intellectual discovery by connecting people of diverse backgrounds and ethnicities with knowledge      Action Items:        Within 6 Months    Develop and implement ongoing staff training in order to improve staff members' abilities to provide excellent service to all our diverse users, especially with regards to primary language barriers and physical/mental disabilities.

As we slide further towards what seems to be an inevitable recession, more companies may have to cut back  on benefits and perks, many of which are used as incentives to attract and retain diversity employees.          juan rodriguez's blog   Add new comment   Read more               Most Companies Believe in Workplace Diversity, But Few Can Actually Define It                          Mar 17, 2008                   The Society for Human Resource Management has found that most organizations believe workplace diversity is important, but  only 30 percent  have an official definition of it, and most respondents said there is no common language to guide companies in managing their diversity efforts. The survey asked more than 1,400 HR professionals and diversity practitioners to rate how well their company's diversity practices accomplished their specific business objectives.            juan rodriguez's blog   Add new comment   Read more               Banking Industry's Failure to Increase Diversity In Management Will Be Costly                          Feb 22, 2008                   According to banking and finance industry officials testimony before a congressional oversight panel, banks and other financial institutions have made very little progress in increasing workforce diversity over the last ten years.  This disturbing news comes despite the fact that these institutions have had dedicated workplace diversity programs in place for more than a decade.  Industry officials also speculate that the percentage of women and minorities in high level positions in banking and finance has probably been exaggerated.            juan rodriguez's blog   Add new comment   Read more               Most Companies With Diversity Policies Don't Have  Minority Executives                          Jan 30, 2008                   A new study has found that 76 percent of global senior executives say that their companies have one or  no minorities  among their top five executives, despite the fact that a majority of the companies (54 percent) have implemented workplace diversity policies.            juan rodriguez's blog   Add new comment   Read more               How to Stop Workplace Discrimination and Create A Healthy Working Environment                          Jan 25, 2008                   No matter how anyone tries to spin it, discrimination in the workplace is  illegal .

Equal Employment Opportunity   What is Equal Employment Opportunity?   The Merit Principle   What are EEO groups?   What is Affirmative Action?     What is Equal Employment Opportunity?   Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) gives all people the right to be considered for any job for which they are skilled and qualified, ensuring that the best person for the job is employed. EEO is based on the principle of recruiting and promoting people on merit.   EEO also promotes a working environment free from harassment of any kind, and access for all staff to job-related opportunities, eg. training and development, promotion and reclassification.       Return to Top     The Merit Principle   Merit is the basis of equal employment opportunity in Australia. The merit principle aims to ensure that the best person for the job is employed. It gives all people the right to be considered for a job on the basis of their abilities, qualifications, experience, and standard of work performance.       Return to Top     What are EEO groups?   Particular groups of people have traditionally been disadvantaged in employment, because of discriminatory laws, rules, employment practices, stereotypes and attitudes. NSW legislation defines these groups, sometimes referred to as 'EEO groups', as         Indigenous Australians       people who speak a first language other than English       women       people with a disability     The University has a legal obligation to eliminate discrimination and harassment and to promote equality of opportunity for members of EEO groups.   Return to Top         What is Affirmative Action?   Members of EEO groups may not have had equal access to job opportunities or training and development for reasons such as past discrimination or prejudice, different educational experience, or being locked into low opportunity jobs. Affirmative Action (AA) strategies aim to redress these past disadvantages and improve employment outcomes for people from EEO groups. The principle of Affirmative Action acknowledges that equal treatment may not produce equal outcomes; differential treatment may be required to achieve real equity.   Examples of Affirmative Action at UTS include the  Wingara Strategy  to promote Indigenous employment; the  inpUTS Educational Access Scheme  and the  Women@UTS Program .

E. Reporting                                         1.  Do awarded programs need to report on their Recruitment and Retention Plans to Enhance Diversity?                                    2.  Are there forms or tables that should be used to report diversity data on Competing Continuation Applications?                        3.  Are there forms or tables that should be used to report diversity data in Non-Competing Continuation Applications?               4.  Do awarded programs need to report trainee diversity on the PHS 2271 trainee appointment form?               5.  Will NIH provide reports on these data?

Resources                                               1.  What are some suggested ways research training grant applicants may recruit and retain individuals to achieve diversity?              2.  Will NIH provide funds to cover the costs of Recruitment and Retention Plans to Enhance Diversity?                                  G. Inquiries                                                                                     A. Policy Related to Diversity                      1.  What is the Recruitment and Retention Plan to Enhance Diversity?       It is a plan that institutional research training, institutional career development, and research education grant award (e.g., T32, T35, K12, CTSA, and R25) applicants must include in their application.  The plan should describe their recruitment and retention efforts to diversify the biomedical, behavioral, clinical, and social sciences workforce through increased participation of talented individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups; individuals with disabilities; and individuals from economically, socially, culturally, or educationally disadvantaged backgrounds.  Institutions are encouraged to identify candidates who will increase diversity on a national or institutional basis.       The T34 Minority Access to Research Careers (MARC) and the Career Opportunities in Research Program (COR) are legislatively mandated programs to increase the recruitment of underrepresented minorities into science and thus are not covered by this policy.                                           2.  What is the NIH Policy to Enhance Diversity and its History?       NIH training grant programs have long required a Plan for the Recruitment and Retention of Underrepresented Minorities.  The NIH has also had research supplement programs aimed at the recruitment of underrepresented minorities and persons with disabilities into the scientific workforce.  In recent years, the NIH has broadened its efforts in recruitment to include other underrepresented groups such as individuals from economically, socially, and educationally disadvantaged backgrounds.       The NIH policy encouraging the recruitment of individuals who will increase the diversity of the biomedical, behavioral, clinical, and social sciences workforce was first included in the program announcement for  Research Supplements to Promote Diversity in Health-Related Research PA-05-015 , released on November 19, 2004. It was subsequently included in the program announcement for the Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) Institutional Research Training Grants (T32)  PA-06-468 , released on June 16, 2006, and the program announcement for Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Awards for Individual Predoctoral Fellowships (F31) to Promote Diversity in Health-Related Research PA-06-041, released on July 21, 2006. This policy has been included in all research training, fellowship, career development, and research education project award Funding Opportunity Announcements (FOAs) since that time, including, notably, the T32 and K12 linked award components of the Clinical Translational Research Award (CTSA) Request for Application FOAs issued for FY2007 and FY2008. It  has now been included in the  PHS 398 (Revised  11/2007)  application instructions:  http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/phs398/phs398.html .                                 3.  What groups does NIH consider to be in need of a special recruitment and retention plan in order to diversify the biomedical, behavioral, clinical, and social sciences workforce?       A.  Individuals from racial and ethnic groups that have been shown by the National Science Foundation to be underrepresented in health-related sciences on a national basis (see data at  http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/showpub.cfm?TopID=2&SubID=27  and the report  Women, Minorities, and Persons with Disabilities in Science and Engineering, 2007, p. 262 ) .  The following racial and ethnic groups have been shown to be underrepresented in biomedical research:  African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, Alaska Natives, Hawaiian Natives, and natives of the U.S. Pacific Islands.     In addition, it is recognized that under-representation can vary from setting to setting and individuals from racial or ethnic groups that can be convincingly demonstrated to be underrepresented by the grantee institution should be included in the recruitment and retention plan.       B.  Individuals with disabilities, who are defined as those with a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities.       C.  Individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds who are defined as:                             1. Individuals who come from a family with an annual income below established low-income thresholds.  These thresholds are based on family size, published by the U.S. Bureau of the Census; adjusted annually for changes in the Consumer Price Index; and adjusted by the Secretary for use in all health professions programs.  The Secretary periodically publishes these income levels at  http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/index.shtml .  For individuals from low-income backgrounds, the institution must be able to demonstrate that such candidates (a) have qualified for Federal disadvantaged assistance; or (b) have received any of the following student loans: Health Professional Student Loans (HPSL), Loans for Disadvantaged Student Program; or (c) have received scholarships from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under the Scholarship for Individuals with Exceptional Financial Need.           2. Individuals who come from a social, cultural, or educational environment such as that found in certain rural or inner-city environments that have demonstrably and recently directly inhibited the individual from obtaining the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to develop and participate in a research career.  Recruitment and retention plans related to a disadvantaged background are most applicable to high school and perhaps undergraduate candidates, but would be more difficult to justify for individuals beyond that level of achievement.                                            4.  How does the new Recruitment and Retention Plan to Enhance Diversity differ from the former Minority Recruitment and Retention Plan for Institutional Research Training Grants?       The new requirement for a Recruitment and Retention Plan to Enhance Diversity expands on the former requirement of a Minority Recruitment and Retention Plan to include retention and recruitment of disabled students and those from disadvantaged backgrounds.                               5.   Is NIH backing away from its commitment to recruiting Under- Represented Minorities in Science?       No.  NIH has expanded its emphasis on the importance of  recruiting all underrepresented groups into science, including those from  underrepresented racial and ethic groups.   The NIH believes that a diverse workforce increases the level of public  trust, the quality of our education and training programs, and the breadth of  our research portfolio.  A diverse  workforce will permit the NIH to more effectively address health issues of  concern to underrepresented groups.  Data  are available demonstrating that the following racial and ethnic groups are  under-represented among research scientists in comparison with their  representation in the U.S.  population at large: African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans,  Alaska Natives, Hawaiian Natives, and natives of the U.S. Pacific  Islands.  However, NIH is broadening its definition of Diversity  Recruitment to include additional groups that may enhance the diversity of the  scientific workforce along additional dimensions.                       6.  What does NIH expect from applicants with respect to the recruitment and retention of individuals from groups identified under 3.B (disabled) and 3.C (disadvantaged) defined in Question 3?        NIH recognizes that the training community will need to gain experience in the recruitment and retention of groups B (disabled) and C (disadvantaged). Applicants are expected to present plans for the recruitment and retention of these two additional groups. Over the next few years NIH expects that applicants, reviewers, grantees, and NIH staff will gain experience in recruitment and retention in these areas.                           7.  Do training grant programs need to recruit students from the 3.C2 group (individuals from disadvantaged environments) defined in Question 3?       The answer depends on the scientific career stage of the targeted trainee group.  The policy states that the C2 category, including individuals who come from a social, cultural, or educational disadvantaged environment, is most applicable to high school and undergraduate candidates, but would be more difficult to justify for individuals beyond that level of achievement.  Therefore, training grant programs that support only graduate-level students and postdoctoral fellows are not required to submit a recruitment and retention plan addressing this group of candidates.                           8.  Graduate students and postdoctoral scholars may receive annual wages below the low-income thresholds.  Should such students be considered as members of group 3.C1 (individuals from economically disadvantaged backgrounds) as defined in Question 3?       No.  Only students who come from families   with an annual income below established low-income thresholds are eligible.  The emphasis is on the  family  income history not on the current financial status of an  individual.                           9.  Immigrants from foreign countries may come from families whose incomes in their native country were below the U.S.-defined low-income thresholds.  How should institutions consider such individuals for the purposes of their NIH training grant applications?       The institution should consider the background of the individual since their family became residents of the U.S.                      10.  How does the institution determine which of the trainees and candidates for appointment as trainees should be included in its diversity recruitment efforts?       Determination of minority/ethnic group status is by self-identification and is voluntary.  The institution should ask the trainees or candidates for appointment whether they wish to be identified as a member of a particular minority/ethnic group.  By extension, NIH suggests that institutions ask trainees or candidates for appointment to self-identify whether they are individuals with disabilities or are from disadvantaged backgrounds.  In these cases, there are precise definitions of who meets the criteria for consideration as part of these groups (See Question 3 and Question 17). The institution should verify that the individual does in fact meet these criteria and request that the individual provide to the institution suitable documentation.                                          B. Application Questions             1.  What needs to be included in the Competing Grant Application?     The applicant should include a single section headed, Recruitment and Retention Plan to Enhance Diversity  This section should address the applicant institution's plans for recruitment and retention touching upon ALL three of the groups specifically mentioned in the Program Announcement:  A) Under-Represented Minorities in Science; B) Individuals with Disabilities; and C) Persons from Disadvantaged Backgrounds.  NIH recognizes that different approaches may be needed to recruit and retain students from the various groups.                              2.  Should there be three separate recruitment and retention plans devoted to each of the groups defined in the program announcement?     No.  There should only be a single plan to enhance diversity and not three separate plans.  The plan is an aggregate of the efforts to recruit and retain students from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, students with disabilities, and those from disadvantaged backgrounds, with the overall goal of increasing diversity of the scientific workforce.                              3.  Are the recruitment and retention plans to achieve diversity the responsibility of the applicant institution or that of the training grant program?     Both the institution and the specific training grant program (e.g., program director and faculty) should be involved in efforts to diversify the scientific workforce.                                4.  Do Competing Continuation Applications need to report trainee diversity data?   Yes.  Competing Continuation Applications need to report data on the diversity of their applicants, trainees, and past trainees to the extent that such records are available at the trainee institution.  Institutions should immediately begin collecting such data for future reports.                            5.  What type of data do I need to include to document program efforts and successes in recruiting individuals from diverse backgrounds?   In the past, NIH specifically asked for data reflecting underrepresented minorities in both competing applications and progress reports.  Applications and progress reports should now include data on: A) underrepresented minorities; B) individuals with disabilities; and C) individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds.  The same person may be counted in more than one of Groups A, B, and C.  For trainees appointed to training grants and institutional career development awards, institutions should count individuals as belonging to the same diversity groups that are self-identified by the individual on the PHS 2271 appointment form.                                    6.  What formats or tables should I use to report these data in my Competing Application?     The  PHS 398 (Revised  11/2007)  includes blank table format pages for reporting the tabular data  required in Institutional NRSA applications, including data pertaining to the  Recruitment and Retention Plan to Enhance Diversity.  These tables should be used, rather than any  other formats that have been used in the past.   All Institutes and Centers of the NIH have agreed to use these table  format pages; however, see Institute specific instructions and Funding  Opportunity Announcements (FOAs) for additional information.                           7.  What documentation does NIH require?     No documentation of specific individuals is required as part of the Competing Grant Application.  Data on all groups are to be reported based on voluntary self-identification by applicants and trainees.  Institutions should, however, request and retain appropriate documentation from individuals with disabilities and from disadvantaged backgrounds.  Underrepresented Minorities (Group A) are to be reported based on voluntary self-identification of applicants and trainees.  Native Americans should be persons who maintain tribal affiliation or community attachment (see PHS 398 Personal Data form page).   Data on Individuals with Disabilities should be based on voluntary self-identification and the institution's need to provide specific special accommodation as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act (see  http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/ada/ ).  Data on Individuals from a Disadvantaged Background should be based on voluntary self-identification and appropriate documentation provided to the institution.  The institution is to certify that the data reported with respect to all three groups are consistent with the definitions given in Question 3.  Records of documentation should be kept by the institution, and NIH staff may request this documentation if questions arise about the veracity of the data submitted by the institution.                              8.  Why do the instructions provided in some training grant, institutional career development, and research education grant program announcements differ from the instructions included in the current version of the PHS 398?     The  instructions in the  PHS 398 (Revised  11/2007)  are to be followed.  Some  older FOAs and Institute/Center websites may not have been updated since the  change in policy.  FOAs and websites will  be updated as soon as possible.                               C. Review Questions             1.  Must the Recruitment and Retention Plan to Enhance Diversity address all of the Diversity Recruitment Groups?     Yes.  The plan to diversify the biomedical, behavioral, clinical, and social sciences workforce should include information about efforts to recruit and retain individuals from all of the NIH-defined Diversity Recruitment Groups (see Question 3).  NIH expects continued efforts to recruit and retain individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups consistent with the policy initiated in 1989, and remains committed to its implementation and success.  Under the new policy, NIH has broadened its expectations with respect to recruitment and retention of additional groups.                              2.  How will the Diversity Recruitment element of applications be reviewed?      Peer reviewers will be asked to consider the diversity of the applicant and trainee pools and merit of plans in two distinct ways, based on the institution's record and future plans: 1 ) For Competing Continuation Applications, the diversity of the applicant and trainee pool is to be considered as part of the review criterion reflecting the trainee pool.  Diversity in the student pool has been associated with improved outcomes in many educational settings.  Thus, accomplishments in this area will contribute to the priority score assigned to the application.  2)  For all Competing Applications, the reviewers will be asked to comment upon the acceptability of the recruitment and retention plans for increasing diversity.  This discussion will occur after the priority score vote on the application has taken place.  The comments and recommendation will be recorded as an administrative note.                                  3.  Will the Diversity Recruitment criterion be reflected in the priority score?      For Renewal (Competing Continuation) Applications, the diversity of the student/postdoc population will be reflected in the priority score.  This assessment will not be applied to new applications and the priority score will not reflect the existing diversity of either the applicant or the trainee pool.  In both cases, however, the Recruitment and Retention Plans to Enhance Diversity will be evaluated and will be reflected in an administrative note.                              4.  Will the reviewers rate the Diversity Recruitment Plan on each of the three recruitment groups?     No.  The reviewers will be asked to consider the Diversity Recruitment plan in its entirety.  The reviewers may comment upon plans regarding recruitment of each of the three defined groups; however, these three elements will not be separately evaluated.    There will be a single assessment reflecting the overall study section's conclusion that the Diversity Recruitment Plan is either Acceptable or Unacceptable.                              5.  Can a plan be acceptable in its efforts to recruit members of only one or another of the defined Diversity Recruitment Groups?     No.  Plans may vary in their emphasis and may excel more in one area than the others with respect to activities targeting individuals in groups 3.A, B, or C.  However, it is not acceptable to focus efforts entirely on one group to the exclusion of the others.  The acceptability of the plan is evaluated as a whole with appropriate weighting of various efforts as judged by the reviewers.  Since recruitment and retention of underrepresented minorities have been long-standing NIH policies, reviewers have experience in judging plans and identifying a reasonable level of success.  While reviewers will have limited experience with plans for recruitment of the other Diversity Recruitment Groups, it is expected that they will become calibrated with respect to this new policy over the next few years.                              6.  In judging the merit of the recruitment and retention plan, should reviewers expect that individual personnel such as the PI and mentors involved in the specific training grant applications will be active in this effort, in addition to whatever other activities the applicant institution as a whole undertakes?     Yes.  Efforts to recruit and retain individuals that contribute to the diversity of the workforce are specific obligations of those members of the institution specifically associated with the training grant application as well as the institution as a whole.

Award Questions             1.  If the Diversity Recruitment Plan is deemed unacceptable, can an award be made?       No.  An award will not be made for any application with an unacceptable Diversity Recruitment Plan.  This policy has been in place for several years.                                  2.  If the Diversity Recruitment Plan is deemed unacceptable, what options exist to address this concern such that an award can be made?     The various Institutes and Centers of the NIH may develop processes by which the applicant may submit an updated Diversity Recruitment Plan that addresses the reviewers' concerns.  ICs and their Advisory Councils will develop policies and procedures regarding staff and Council review and resolution of peer review group concerns.  An award may be issued after such concerns have been resolved.                                  E. Reporting Questions             1.  Do awarded programs need to report on their Recruitment and Retention Plans to Enhance Diversity?     Yes.  Awardees are expected to report on any changes to their  Recruitment and Retention Plans to Enhance Diversity as part of the annual  progress section of their Non-Competing Continuation Application ( PHS Form 2590, Revised 11/2007 ).   Awardees are expected to report on progress in this area, including specific  activities undertaken, aggregate numbers of applications, acceptances,  enrollments, and retention and completion of training for diversity recruitment  groups.  Competing Continuation (Renewal) or Supplemental (Revision)  Applications should include this information as part of the Progress Report.                            2.  Are there forms or tables that should be used to report diversity data on Competing Continuation Applications?     Yes.  The  PHS 398 (Revised  11/2007)  includes tables that should be used to report the numbers of  applicants and trainees in each of the Diversity Recruitment Groups.                           3.  Are there forms or tables that should be used to report diversity data in Non-Competing Continuation Applications?     Yes.  The  PHS 2590 (Revised  11/2007)  includes a new Trainee Diversity Report that is to be used to  submit data on diversity of the appointed trainees, including race, ethnicity,  sex/gender, trainees with disabilities, and trainees from disadvantaged  backgrounds.  This new form replaces the use  of the Inclusion Enrollment Report form for this purpose.                           4.  Do awarded programs need to report trainee diversity on the PHS 2271 trainee appointment form?     Yes.  Awardee  institutions should use the updated Appointment Form  PHS 2271 (Revised 11/2007)  (PDF - 623 KB) to report on their appointees.  This form  has been modified to provide for voluntary self-identified reporting of individuals  with disabilities and individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, as well as  voluntary self-identified race/ethnicity.   All personal information will be kept confidential and reported only in  aggregate numbers.                              5.  Will NIH provide reports on these data?     NIH will periodically publish reports on trends in trainee appointments that will include demographic data reflecting the dimensions of diversity recruitment now to be tracked.  Anonymized and aggregated data reports are available from NIH upon request according to well-developed access policies designed to protect the identity of individuals and small groups of individuals.                                  F. Resources Available             1.   What are some suggested ways research training grant applicants may recruit and retain individuals to achieve diversity?     Some suggested ways to recruit and retain students from underrepresented minority groups include targeted mailings and personal visits to Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic Serving Institutions, Tribal Colleges, or other institutions that serve a significant number of minority students ( http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/edlite-minorityinst.html ), along with participation at national minority student science conferences such as the Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students ( http://www.abrcms.org/index.html ) and Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans ( http://www.sacnas.org/ ).  Additional suggestions, including commendable strategies from existing programs supported by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, may be viewed at  http://www.nigms.nih.gov/Training/Diversity/ .      As stated earlier, applicants may have limited experience in recruiting students with disabilities and from disadvantaged backgrounds, and there may be limited resources available. However, the following are several sources that may be useful to applicants:           Department of Justice (ADA Home Page at  http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/ada/adahom1.htm ),        National Council on Disabilities ( http://www.ncd.gov/newsroom/publications/2003/education.htm )        Department of Education ( http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/index.html ).       Department of Transportation ( http://www.dotcr.ost.dot.gov/asp/dotpart/msi/dotpartmin.asp ),       A number of educational institutions, professional societies, and non-profit organizations also provide information about facilitating the participation of individuals with disabilities in graduate programs.  For example, see: Temple University Institute on Disabilities ( http://isc.temple.edu/neighbor/ds/dsprograms.htm ); American Chemical Society ( http://membership.acs.org/C/CWD/index.htm ); American Speech-Language-Hearing Association ( http://www.asha.org/students/financial-aid/ ); Association on Higher Education and Disability ( http://www.ahead.org/ ); and Society for Disability Studies ( http://www.disstudies.org ).  A number of institutions are known for their efforts to provide educational opportunities to individuals with disabilities.  For example, see: Rochester Institute of Technology ( http://www.ntid.rit.edu/ ); and   Gallaudet  University ( http://www.gallaudet.edu/ ).  A list of institutions and state resources serving disabled persons is available at  http://www.geocities.com/ketchum4/bestcollegesanduniversitiespg2.htm .  Information relevant to recruitment and retention of individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds may be found at the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) site:   http://bhpr.hrsa.gov/DSA/sfag/health_professions/9sdhpcom-01.htm .  Most educational institutions and many state agencies also provide information on educational opportunities for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds.                                                                         2.  Will NIH provide funds to cover the costs of Recruitment and Retention Plans to Enhance Diversity?         To the extent that costs associated with recruitment and retention are consistent with the NIH Grants Policy Statement and applicable OMB Cost Principles, they are an allowable expense that may be paid from the Training-Related Expenses budget category.  See:   http://grants1.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps_2003/NIHGPS_Part11.htm .         With respect to Training-Related Expenses, the NIH Grants Policy Statement provides as follows: Funds are provided to defray costs such as staff salaries, consultant costs, equipment, research supplies, staff travel, and other expenses directly related to the training program. Funds are requested and awarded as a lump sum on the basis of the predetermined amount per predoctoral and postdoctoral trainee approved for support. Levels are published in the NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts. Interested applicants should consult the program announcement regarding the specific level for programs such as the short-term training program, the MARC U*STAR program, or the COR program.       Under exceptional circumstances, which can include accommodating the disabilities of a trainee, it is possible to request organizational costs above the standard level. Requests for additional costs must be explained in detail and justified in the application. Consultation with NIH program staff in advance of such requests is strongly advised.       The above language regarding Training-Related Expenses applies only to awards under the Kirschstein-NRSA program.  For allowable expenses under other training, career development, and education grant programs, see the relevant Funding Opportunity Announcement.                                          INQUIRIES         For comments or questions concerning this document, please contact the NIH Research Training Office at 301-435-4225 or by email at  NIHTrain@mail.nih.gov .

Since there is no funding in the state budget for this program, 2008 claims cannot be paid or processed.     In addition, funding has been reduced for all existing HRA workloads. As a result, you may experience delays with phone calls or HRA claims and correspondence for 2007 and prior years.    Homeowner Assistance Program   This program allows a once-a-year payment from the State of   California to qualified individuals based on part of the property taxes assessed   and paid on their homes. For the 2008 claim year, the maximum amount of assistance   that an eligible homeowner may receive is $472.60, which is 139 percent of   the property taxes paid of the first $34,000 of full value of the home (139%   x $340.00). You may be eligible to file a 2008 claim if you are a United States   citizen, designated alien or qualified alien when you file your claim and you   met the following criteria on December 31, 2007:      You were 62 years of age or older, blind, or disabled.    You owned and lived in your own home.    You had a total household income of $44,096 or less.     Renter Assistance Program   This program allows a once-a-year payment from the State of California to  qualified individuals based on part of the property taxes that they paid indirectly when they  paid their rent. The maximum amount of assistance that a claimant may receive is 139 percent  of $250.00, the statutory property tax equivalent (139% x $250.00), which is $347.50. You may  be eligible to file a 2008 claim for Renter Assistance if you are a United States citizen,  designated alien or qualified alien when you file your claim and you met the following criteria  on December 31, 2007:        You were 62 years of age or older, blind, or disabled.     You lived in a qualified rented residence in California.     You paid $50.00 or more per month in rent on that residence.     You had a total household income of $44,096, or less.

Cultural sensitivity, patience, tolerance and open-mindedness are required. A sense of humour and a sense of adventure are both essential!    As a general rule, ABV Volunteers have a minimum of 5 years professional experience in their field. It is important to note that ABV also does not provide work experience for inexperienced Volunteers - our Volunteers are expected to be experts in their fields already. Recent graduates who do not yet have at least 5 years professional experience should consider applying to other agencies targeted towards younger Volunteers.    ABV assignments cover almost anything that develops local skills and expertise, so we recruit people with a wide range of skills, such as:    Finance   Accounting   Management & Strategic Planning   Education & Training   Marketing   Agriculture/Horticulture   Trades/Technical skills   Health - Planning & Finance   I.T.- Websites, Databases, Software Training, Systems   Disability/Advocacy   Youth Employment   Manufacturing  Export  Textile/Clothing  Forestry - Sustainability  Fisheries  HIV/AIDS  Shipping                      To view PDF files on this page download Adobe Acrobat Reader                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Secondary Navigation Menu         Upcoming Assignments Becoming A Volunteer Skills Required Being Selected for an Assignment Time Commitments Cost Partners/Spouses Insurance Police Checks Code of Conduct Conditions Pre-Departure Information Health Issues Volunteer Profiles Apply To Be A Volunteer FAQs Returned Volunteers                                                              Site Information:            © 2007 Australian Business Volunteers           |  Privacy Policy      |  Terms and Conditions      |  Site Map      |  Web Design by Next Digital

Community Guidelines         Yahoo! communities (Chat, Clubs, Message Boards, Profiles, etc....) give Yahoo! members a place to meet, interact, and share ideas with each other. Just like a real community, you may have different opinions than others in Yahoo! communities, and just lik e the real world, you may face different norms or even legal restrictions when participating in a community based in another country.  The Yahoo! community experience is best when people follow a few rules. Here are some key ones to remember:      Do not harass, abuse, or threaten other members.   Do not post content that is obscene or otherwise objectionable.  Try to stay on topic. If you want to discuss a topic that is not      related to the community area in which you are participating, please    go to another topic area or create a new one.  Refrain from using these community services for commercial or      advertising purposes, or for any illegal purposes.  Please do not ""spam""   or otherwise post in quantity through automated methods..

The diversity infrastructure was strengthened in early 2000 when diversity action plans were integrated into annual human resource plans. The Fund's diversity strategy is inclusive, balances quantitative and qualitative objectives, and seeks to mainstream diversity into the day-to-day implementation of human resource management. Excellent policies are in place to meet diversity objectives. Still missing is consistent implementation, with sufficient accountability of individual supervisors reflected in performance reviews, promotion decisions, and merit pay.   Over the past five years, the representation of developing country nationals in economist career stream grades A9 to A15 has remained steady, with the share slightly exceeding the regional quota (1)  of 37.9 percent; at the B level, developing country representation has risen to 33.2 percent. The share of developing country nationals drops sharply from the A1 to A8 grade group to the A9 to A15 grade group, and further in the B grades in most departments. English-speaking candidates and staff from industrial countries have an advantage at the Fund, specifically in the functional and support departments.   Regionally, the Middle East continues to be the most underrepresented staff group in all grade categories and career streams. Compared with the regional quota of 8.6 percent, Middle Eastern staff account for only 5.3 percent of staff in grades A9 to A15 and 5.8 percent of staff in the B grades. Africa's representation in grades A9 to A15 is 6.1 percent and in the B grades 3.8 percent, relative to the regional quota of 4.2 percent. The share of Asian staff has gradually increased to 14.9 percent in grades A9 to A15 and 15.9 percent in the B grades, still below the regional quota of 17.4 percent. Nine departments have no B-level Middle Eastern staff and 13 departments have no B-level African staff. In absolute terms, the small number of staff from the African and Middle Eastern regions makes these calculations subject to great variation with retirements and other individual career choices.    The promotion rate of staff from industrial countries exceeded that of developing country nationals in most grade groups in 2000. Following important gains in promoting African staff to B-level economist positions from 1996 to 1998, promotion rates for that group dropped in 1999 and 2000. The promotion rate of Middle Eastern staff was below the Fund average in grades A9 and above, particularly so in the B grades.   Regional grade profiles indicate slight improvements in Grade A15 for underrepresented staff groups, with shares of African, Asian, and Middle Eastern economists increasing in 2000. The A15/A14 ratio is still highest for U.S. economists, but has improved for African and Middle Eastern economists.   From a gender standpoint, women economists' concentration in lower grades and lower representation overall (22.9 percent in grades A9 to A15 and 9.2 percent in the B grades) continues to be a concern, despite improvement over the past several years. In the specialized career streams, (2)  women account for 55.6 percent of staff in grades A9 to A15, but only 21.1 percent of B-level staff, showing no improvement since 1996. Women's share in EP (Economist Program) recruitment achieved a record high—over 40 percent—in 2000, but recruitment into grades A12 to A15 dropped to just under 20 percent. Women's share at the B-level Fundwide (11.7 percent) showed no increase in 2000. As of end-2000, EXR (the External Relations Department) did not employ any women at the B level and EU2 (the European II Department), FAD (the Fiscal Affairs Department), INS (the IMF Institute), LEG (the Legal Department), MAE (the Monetary and Exchange Affairs Department), and RES (the Research Department) employed only one woman in that grade group. Compared with other international institutions, the Fund's performance with respect to gender diversity is average.   HRD (the Human Resources Department) has introduced a number of policy reforms that support diversity efforts Fundwide. New interview methods and related training have been designed to better assess competencies and improve culture- and gender-sensitivity. In January 2000, the First Deputy Managing Director provided guidelines for departments to intensify external diversity recruitment to fill an unusually high number of openings that year. Departments' actual recruitment outcome was disappointing from a diversity standpoint, however. While recruitment of developing country nationals and women to the EP program was exceptionally high, it was otherwise uneven across career streams and grades. Regardless of the relatively large pool of qualified candidates identified by the interview panels, very few Middle Eastern and African staff were hired.    Newcomers have benefited from mentoring services provided by departments and the Diversity Advisor's office. In 2001, HRD will be launching a Fundwide mentoring program for mid-career newcomers, with special attention to African and Middle Eastern staff and women. Other enhancements include improved orientation programs and guidelines that provide time for new staff to settle their families before being sent on mission. Family-friendly policies previously reserved for women have been extended to male staff, a childcare center for children of Fund staff opened in 2001, and domestic partners of Fund staff are now entitled to medical benefits. Finally, the adoption in 2000 of the CWS (Compressed Work Schedule) contributes greatly to efforts to reduce work-related stress and improve the work/private life balance for staff.    The IMF's ""Diversity Week"" takes place three times a year and provides a myriad of departmental and Fundwide workshop opportunities. Despite positive feedback, participation remains low; management enforcement is needed to raise the importance of training. Staff development and management training programs have been revised gradually to incorporate a diversity perspective. Programs to strengthen English language and writing skills—particularly beneficial to minority staff groups—need to be strengthened.   Diversity management components have been integrated into management assessment tools, including the 360-degree SAM (Subordinate Assessment of Managers). The APR (Annual Performance Review) form has been revised to leave less room for subjective, biased assessment and language. Performance review and promotion procedures are now more structured, transparent, and balanced. Further progress will require greater accountability on diversity items in management assessments, including consequences.   The Fund demonstrated exceptional courage in its 1997-1999 review of individual discrimination cases. The experience indicates that a specific definition of discrimination is needed to supplement management's previous statement on zero tolerance of discrimination, the IMF's Policy on Harassment, and the Code of Conduct. All staff must feel confident that the Fund is protecting them as an employer. More open dialogue on sensitive topics such as racism is also needed.   Overall diversity results continue to vary widely department-to-department. Some departments have developed best practices that were later adopted Fundwide, such as the managerial standards prepared by EU1 (the European I Department). Several departments have developed databases for career planning. Others have increased performance feedback frequency, which is particularly beneficial for minority staff less familiar with the Fund's working culture. Far too few departments, however, make an extra effort to support underrepresented staff.   Conclusions   Year 2000 marked the fifth anniversary of the Fund's systematic diversity efforts. The diversity culture has evolved significantly during this period, and the Fund has become a source of many best practices in its diversity and broader human resource management. The ongoing challenge for the Fund is implementing these policies and practices in an efficient manner by increasing awareness, honing necessary skills, and demonstrating unfailing will across the organization.   Departments have been made responsible for their own diversity efforts, supported by assistance from HRD and the Diversity Advisor. Diversity data—more extensive and transparent than ever before—have revealed varied progress department to department. Partly to blame is the lack of sufficient accountability for diversity actions in merit pay or promotion decisions. Although diversity items are now included in performance competencies, the lack of consequences may risk the credibility of the Fund's commitment. Chronically low participation rates in diversity and other management development programs exacerbate those concerns.   Statistics indicate that more remains to be done. In 2000, women's share in total Fund staff did not increase; the developing country staff share in economist grades A9 to A15 dropped; and, although the share of developing country nationals at the B level improved, it is still significantly lower than the combined country quota. In the B grades, the Fund currently employs only 13 Africans—four of whom will retire in the next two to three years—and 20 Middle Eastern staff. These figures reflect vulnerability and significant gaps that will be difficult to fill without intensified efforts in development and career planning. Without strong external recruitment to mid-career and B grades, the Fund will not be able to make adequate progress.   Although some slowing of momentum is expected after five years of diversity efforts, the unevenness of departmental progress and the persistence of long-standing diversity concerns signals a lack of sufficient accountability, incentives, and commitment. Diversifying staff entails change, struggle, and extra effort. It requires firm actions to overcome resistance to changing individual and cultural mindsets. Prospects for success rest on individual supervisors' ability to understand and convey the rationale and business case for shifting the status quo. The Fund has excellent policies and practices in place, and many departments—although still too few—have adopted the diversity management mindset. That mindset needs to be broadened and deepened through the daily implementation of diversity-related policies Fundwide and a more open dialogue on topics such as discrimination, racism, and harassment.   Recommendations   1. Strengthen supervisors' accountability for diversity efforts, including concrete actions and quantitative progress. Enforce that accountability in performance appraisals, promotions, and merit pay decisions. (Management) (3)   2. Within the framework of human resources planning, track applicant pools, candidates, and appointments by grade group, gender, and nationality. (Departments, HRD)   3. Provide comprehensive writing training to all non-native English speakers in order to compensate for language disadvantages, develop writing skills, reduce work-related stress, and ensure high quality, timely departmental output. Sufficient training and coaching should be available to any staff member whose formal or informal performance assessment refers to writing skills development needs. Supervisors should collaborate closely with individual staff members, SDD (the Staff Development Division), and writing testers to ensure seamless support for staff. (Management, Departments, HRD)   4. Ensure diversity in the composition of all recruitment missions and panels. All panel members should have participated in RSD (the Recruitment and Staffing Division) and SDD training by end-2002. (Departments, HRD)    5. Make management and diversity training—including topics such as harassment and discrimination—available for staff at earlier stages of their careers and make such training a prerequisite for promotion. Make cultural diversity training an element of mission preparation. (Management)   6. Strengthen HRD and EXR cooperation to improve the Fund's public image as an employer and facilitate recruitment of the most desirable candidates. Monitor the Fund's reputation as an employer and intensify public relations efforts during recruitment missions. (HRD, EXR)   7. Define the Fund's zero tolerance of discrimination policy in specific terms to ensure that all managers and staff understand the concept of discrimination and recognize the rationale of the policy. Managers and staff must be aware of the nature of discrimination; their responsibility to intervene in discriminatory situations; and the available support systems the Fund has in place. While the discrimination policy would supplement the IMF Code of Conduct, the Policy on Harassment, Management Standards, and the forthcoming Mission Code of Conduct, it should stand on its own as an individual policy statement. (Management)               I. Introduction     Staff diversity is a fundamental personnel principal at the IMF. Achieving a level of diversity that reflects all 183 member countries sets high demands on the institution. Equal rights and opportunities are frequently challenged. Good intentions and policy statements do not suffice; management, through its leadership and interactions with staff, translates words into action. All staff members are responsible for demonstrating sensitivity, awareness, tolerance, and respect. Ensuring fairness and justice requires extraordinary efforts, given the deep roots of discrimination in society and in every work community.    In the Fund, the concept of diversity has gradually evolved from a focus on geographical representation to an approach that encompasses a broad range of staff characteristics, including gender, language, race, religion, family status, physical ability, and sexual orientation. The Fund has set two main goals for its diversity efforts: (1) promote higher shares of women and underrepresented nationalities and (2) ensure that all individuals are respected and recognized, have equal opportunities, and are provided positive support and career development options. The Fund implements internationally accepted—but typically Western—human resource practices. Within this framework, the Fund is doing its best to fully integrate a variety of diversity approaches. The aim is to take advantage of existing diversity and to ensure that all staff are fully equipped to perform well and contribute to the Fund.   In 1995, the Managing Director created the position of Special Advisor on Diversity to address concerns identified in various studies, to assist management, and to track progress. In 2000, the Advisor's contractual position was converted to a fixed-term staff appointment. The Diversity Advisor reports to management and collaborates closely with the newly restructured HRD. The objective over the next three years is to fully integrate diversity into the Fund's human resource management. While diversity programs are developed and monitored by the Diversity Advisor and HRD, implementation depends on the efforts of departmental supervisors, review committees, and recruitment panels. Sustainable change takes place in day-to-day operations and management practices; in that regard, accountability is crucial.   The Fund's diversity program was formally established in 1996 in the Managing Director's statement on ""Measures to Promote Staff Diversity and Address Discrimination."" The statement emphasized the importance of:     human resource and diversity management,   equal rights and opportunities,   zero tolerance of discrimination,   remedial action through reviews and adjustment measures,   transparency in personnel policies and practices,   open communication in departments,   constructive performance feedback, and   departmental accountability in promoting staff diversity.     Human resource indicators are carefully monitored to assess diversity status and trends, thereby providing a framework for measuring quantitative progress. The personnel data system (PeopleSoft) compiles data on citizenship, gender, age, education, and language of the country of citizenship (native-language). Fund staff can view human resource indicators on the Fund's intranet. Efforts are underway to further develop qualitative and quantitative indicators.   From 1996-1999 each department prepared an annual diversity action plan and follow-up report, which the Diversity Advisor monitored to assess changes in management practices, in equity and transparency of procedures, and in the working culture. In 2000, management requested departments to prepare comprehensive human resources plans, including diversity aspects. Diversity programs and reviews now have a two-fold focus: (1) to integrate diversity into Fundwide human resource management functions (mainstreaming) and (2) to address specific equity issues as they arise.    This 2000 Diversity Annual Report is the fourth progress report since departments developed their first diversity action plans in 1996. Progress is measured by trends over time.    The objectives of this report are to:      outline the Fund's diversity strategy;   report on the main actions taken in calendar year 2000 and monitor and analyze progress over time;   identify concerns; and   recommend further steps.                 II. The Fund’s Diversity Strategy             Diversity:  The combination of all the characteristics that make us who we are, including nationality, race, culture, ethnic background, gender, age, religion, native language, physical ability, sexual orientation, education, and profession.             Diversity Management:  Fully utilizing the resources and skill mix found within the Fund's membership and international workforce. Attracting the best-qualified diverse candidates. Empowering, engaging, and encouraging all staff members to develop their potential and gain fair recognition.         The diversity strategy is built upon the following principles:      An  inclusive approach  including, but not limited to, gender, nationality, and language.   Quantitative and qualitative guidelines , rather than quotas.   Regular  monitoring  of progress.   Transparency , with statistics and best practices made public.   Mainstreaming  diversity into Fundwide human resource policies and practices.   Decentralized implementation and responsibility , involving management, review committees, departments, and informal networks, groups, and individual staff.     The goal is to achieve a balanced distribution of diverse staff at all grades in all career streams. In that context, fairness, equality of treatment, zero tolerance of discrimination, and opportunity for all staff and applicants are required. Every staff member should feel respected and valued; have opportunities to develop and demonstrate individual skills and potential; obtain guidance, support, and constructive feedback; and see that prospects and success depend on individual effort and team performance. As a result, the Fund's organizational flexibility improves, its ability to adjust to changes is enhanced, and its institutional innovativeness and problem solving capacity are strengthened.       Guidelines for Staff and Managers     In view of the international character of the Fund and the value that the Fund attaches to diversity, staff are expected to act with tolerance, sensitivity, respect, and impartiality toward other persons' cultures and backgrounds.   All staff are expected to treat their colleagues-whether supervisors, peers, or subordinates-with courtesy and respect, without harassment or physical or verbal abuse, and should at all times avoid behavior at the workplace that, although not rising to the level of harassment or abuse, may nonetheless create an atmosphere of hostility or intimidation.   As individuals, we all share responsibility for respecting and valuing each other. Individual managers, however, make these efforts credible by following high standards in their own daily managerial activities and serving as examples for junior staff.   A good Fund manager/supervisor makes a conscious effort to promote and encourage diversity within his or her department and division. This entails not only creating an open and encouraging atmosphere, but also developing new activities focusing on staff diversity, while integrating diversity aspects into existing management practices.   Effective managers make themselves available to staff members who may wish to raise concerns in confidence; they deal with such situations in an impartial and sensitive manner. Managers should endeavor to create an atmosphere in which staff feel free to use-without fear of reprisal-existing institutional channels for conflict resolution, and to express concerns about situations that are, or have the potential to be, conflictive.   The Fund does not tolerate intentional or unintentional discrimination, unfair treatment, disrespectful behavior, or harassment on the part of any staff member.

Fundwide Accomplishments From 1996 to 2000     The Fund's diversity accomplishments over the past five years can be broadly grouped into the areas of data, planning and reporting, recruitment, newcomers' support, work/private life policies, staff development, management training, APR and promotion process reforms, and efforts to reduce discrimination and harassment.   Recognizing the strong role of data in the Fund's work culture, the Diversity Advisor has developed specific diversity indicators and reports for SPMs (Senior Personnel Managers), AOs (Administrative Officers), and HRD. HRD has developed software that consolidates core diversity data for planning and monitoring. This important step in mainstreaming diversity has been adopted as a best practice in many other institutions, including in the private sector. The Fund now publicly signals its commitment to diversity and transparency with the inclusion of more comprehensive data on staff diversity in its  Annual Report.   Enhanced transparency has improved trust significantly, stimulated interest in diversity issues, and empowered staff to take initiative. However, some staff groups, including sub-Saharan African and Arab staff, still express concern that hidden inequality and discrimination exists; these concerns should be openly discussed.    The Fund's systematic approach to diversity management was initiated in 1996 when departments prepared their first diversity action plans. The diversity infrastructure and departmental accountability were strengthened in early 2000 when diversity action plans were integrated into annual human resource plans. This new approach streamlined reporting, simplified information flow between departments, HRD, and the Diversity Advisor's office, and set the stage to integrate diversity into overall human resource management and day-to-day supervisory practices. The Diversity Advisor's work in 2000 focused on (1) mainstreaming diversity into human resources management and (2) promoting the recruitment and career progress of African and Middle Eastern staff.   Responding to SPMs' requests, in 1999 the Diversity Advisor developed the first Diversity Pipeline Reports, which consolidate career-relevant information on underrepresented staff in each grade. Those reports, updated biannually and supplemented by additional reporting as needed, are designed to facilitate departments' diversity staffing and career planning and to increase the visibility of diverse staff Fundwide. Unfortunately, many departments have not made use of the pipeline reports in their planning, relying instead on more limited, traditional recruitment channels and personal contacts.    Recruitment has traditionally been the most visible diversity function. RSD has contributed greatly to diversity efforts over the past five years, including by developing an electronic database of underrepresented candidates, contacts, and professional associations and strengthening other channels of outreach to non-traditional candidates. Proper maintenance of the database is crucial to ensure its effectiveness. Elsewhere, RSD has designed new interview methods and training to better assess technical and behavioral competencies and to improve sensitivity to and interpretation of cultural and gender differences in interview situations. In 2000, HRD introduced an Internet-based application system to improve documentation, efficiency, and transparency of the recruitment process; the system will also facilitate reviews of equal treatment of applicants and candidates. Care will be taken to ensure that every candidate, regardless of Internet access, can still apply. Perhaps most importantly, in January 2000, the First Deputy Managing Director provided guidelines for departments to intensify external diversity recruitment in a systematic manner to fill an exceptionally high number of openings that year. Despite these combined efforts, excessive workloads and time pressures appear to have hindered proper staff planning and conflicted with good diversity intentions.   Stress is one of many factors in the work environment that influences diversity. Indeed, the higher the stress levels, the less tolerance there is for differences. Vacancies have had to be filled quickly and new staff have been expected to understand the Fund's culture and expectations without guidance. In those circumstances, managers tend to view it as safer and easier to hire from traditional pools of candidates.    Newcomers' early experiences in the Fund have a long-lasting impact on their outlook and overall work performance. Since 1997, the Diversity Advisor has arranged mentoring for individual newcomers, usually upon request of the new staff members themselves. While the focus has been on underrepresented staff, no staff member has been turned down. Supervisors appear to be recognizing the value of mentoring, illustrated in 2000 by the increase in supervisor-initiated requests for mentoring services. As described in  Chapter IV , several departments have developed their own mentoring programs for newcomers. In some of those cases, specifically at the mid-career level, efforts need to be strengthened. In an important step forward, HRD will be launching in 2001 a Fundwide mentoring program for mid-career newcomers, including mentor training, with special attention paid to staff in underrepresented categories. Other initiatives to support newcomers include improved orientation programs and guidelines that provide time for new staff to settle their families before being sent on mission. The IMF Spouse/Partner Association also provides support for families upon relocation to Washington, D.C. In 2000, SBD (the Staff Benefits Division) developed a well-targeted relocation program for new staff, which was, unfortunately, not funded in the 2001 budget.   Issues related to work/private life balance have become more prominent in the Fund as global developments and budget constraints have increased pressures on staff. The institution's culture demands hard work, long hours, and total commitment to any and all requests from management and the Executive Board. Several policy reforms have been introduced over the past five years in an attempt to offset those pressures. A 1996 revision of GAO (General Administrative Order) 15 enabled the Fund to establish more flexible working hours, part-time work, job sharing, and work-at-home arrangements in all career streams. An emergency childcare system was also put in place for sick children of Fund staff. As a result of extensions of family-friendly policies previously available only to women, male staff are now able to take adoption leave and formal guidelines restrict the travel of male staff around the time of the birth or adoption of a child. In 2000, medical benefits were extended to domestic partners of staff members and additional benefits are under consideration. The successful experience in 2000 of the CWS pilot resulted in the approval of the policy Fundwide (to be implemented in 2001). Finally, a full-time childcare center for children of Fund staff opened in March 2001, providing an especially valuable asset for the Fund as an international employer with many dual career families. However, many staff have yet to take advantage of these important policy reforms, particularly flexible work arrangements. Senior staff who role-model healthier work/private life balances by implementing available flexibility in their own schedules have a crucial influence.   Staff development programs have been revised gradually to incorporate a diversity perspective. Diversity is now an explicit element in the orientation program for new staff. Supplementary e-learning programs are currently being designed to ensure that all Fund staff, regardless of hectic workdays, have access to learning opportunities. The IMF's ""Diversity Week"" takes place three times a year and provides a myriad of departmental and Fundwide workshop opportunities on topics such as delegation of work, providing feedback, exploring cultural assumptions, gender in the workplace, and communication. Despite positive feedback from workshop attendees, participation continues to be low. Most Fund staff members do not have training in human resources management and would clearly benefit from such learning opportunities if provided sufficient time and incentives. Current low participation in diversity and other management development programs not only compromises the diversity commitment but is also a waste of HRD's limited budget resources.   Recognizing the benefits of supplemental English language and writing training, SDD and individual departments developed writing programs and guidelines for staff. However, some staff members have confronted situations in which supervisors note language skill weaknesses in the individual's performance assessment, but language experts' tests and interviews do not result in recommendations for training. This gap may have a negative influence on equal opportunities for non-native English speakers and should be reviewed by HRD.   Diversity items have been incorporated into management training programs—including the Management Development Center—and linked to management competencies in the APR system and promotion standards. Diversity management components were integrated into the SFE (Supervisory Feedback Exercise) and into its replacement, the SAM (Subordinate Assessment of Managers) instrument. In evaluating the performance of department heads, SPMs, and all other senior-level supervisors, SAM's 360 degree assessments highlight the importance of people and work management. Integrated diversity management makes those skills essential elements in the Fund's supervisory practices. SDD studied gender differences in SFEs and will follow up with a SAM review in 2001. Those findings will be made available to staff in due course. In addition to classroom training and performance assessments, supervisors can now receive individual coaching, including on diversity awareness and skills, for longer periods than before; division chiefs are now eligible for two years and directors and SPMs from two to five years of coaching.   In 1999, the Diversity Advisor followed up on a 1994 study of gender differences in written APRs and shared those findings with supervisors and staff groups during the APR period in 1999 and 2000. A similar study on geographic groupings, focusing on underrepresented staff groups, will be conducted in 2001. Various reviews and surveys have resulted in a revised APR form that is well-structured and based on objective competencies. The form leaves less room for subjective, biased assessment and language, even though some sections still require narrative evaluation. Several departments have increased the frequency of feedback to ensure clarity and transparency of performance standards, which is especially helpful for minority staff. Assessments of department heads are now part of the APR system and the related database is very comprehensive. These accomplishments benefit not only the Fund, but also provide best practices for other international institutions. Further progress will require greater accountability on each management competency, including diversity items. Without accountability and sufficient consequences, these initiatives will lose their influence.   Career progress poses equity challenges in any organization. The review committees, in cooperation with HRD, reformed their procedures to develop a more structured, transparent, and balanced competency-based evaluation and promotion process. The mobility program was strengthened to enhance career opportunities for staff who have spent an extended period of time in their current positions. Vacancy announcement and selection procedures have also been revised. However, most of the latest career advancement improvements benefit economists. Recognizing that bias, in 2000 management assigned the Working Group on Specialized Career Streams to review such issues as qualifications, recruitment and retention, development and succession planning, promotions, and leadership. From a diversity perspective this is important; equitable treatment and opportunities can only be promoted in an inclusive culture that acknowledges all staff groups equally.   The 1994 Status of Women in the Fund study highlighted grade and salary discrepancies in the female-dominated career ladders—Accounting, Human Resources, and Writing and Editing. A 1998 follow-up study indicated that the Fund had significantly improved equity in those ladders. To further improve transparency in assessments and merit increases, HRD's Staff Compensation and Benefits Policy Division has committed to conducting gender and nationality-grouping reviews on a regular basis.   The Fund demonstrated exceptional courage in the 1997-1999 review of individual discrimination cases. Previously unacknowledged discrimination issues were discussed and remedies to address biases were defined. While increasing transparency and communication, the exercise also led to some disappointments and individual grievances that continue to be under review. The experience indicates that discrimination needs to be clearly defined and more precise guidelines given on appropriate behavior and responsibility to intervene in discriminatory situations. Related to discrimination, the Policy on Harassment was revised in 1999 and serves as an excellent example of an inclusive approach to harassment, rather than separating sexual and other harassment aspects. The Fund issued a Code of Conduct in 1998 and appointed its first Ethics officer in 2000, signifying that the institution takes seriously its responsibility to educate staff and effectively address misconduct. These initiatives need to be strengthened with a detailed policy on discrimination. The lack of such a policy may send a signal to staff that the topic of discrimination is considered to be unimportant.   Finally, the Fund's increasing acceptance of diversity was illustrated in 1999 when gay and lesbian staff established IMF/GLOBE, a forum to advance non-discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The existence of IMF-GLOBE testifies to increasing tolerance and also serves as an encouraging signal to potential employees to whom these issues are relevant. This is a promising start for a more open culture.               IV. Departmental Progress     This chapter assesses trends at the departmental level, reviewing both quantitative progress and qualitative changes relative to previous years' indicators. Data are drawn from the PeopleSoft database and departmental diversity and human resource reports.   In January 2000, the First Deputy Managing Director advised department heads about  the completion of three important reports: HRD's Fundwide strategic human resource management plan; OIA's (Office of Internal Audit's) review of the Fund's personnel management practices; and the report of the Working Group on Stress. Taking the findings of those reports into account, he requested departments to prepare comprehensive and integrated human resource plans, including diversity planning, which would be monitored and updated annually.    The same memorandum outlined new guidelines on external recruitment to fill roughly 300 openings—twice the normal recruitment volume—in the coming year. Given this unique opportunity to improve staff diversity, departments were requested to intensify efforts to identify and hire qualified women, nationals of developing countries, and nationals of underrepresented industrial countries.   The First Deputy Managing Director noted that external recruitment for B1 to B4 positions should be preceded by a systematic search process to ensure that shortlists for these positions include minority as well as majority candidates. Progress in that regard would be reviewed in department heads' APRs. Actual recruitment outcomes in 2000 were disappointing from a diversity perspective, however, particularly at the mid-career level (see  Chapter V  for more details on recruitment).   Diversity results continue to vary widely department to department. A broad overview since 1996 highlights a few prominent trends. Area departments generally have high representations of staff from the regions they cover. Staff from developing countries continue to have higher representations in economist departments—45.4 percent in area departments, 44.1 percent in functional departments—than in support departments (34.9 percent). In most departments, the share of developing country nationals drops sharply from the A1 to A8 grade group to the A9 to A15 grade group, and further in the B grades; area departments—with the exception of EU1 and EU2—and INS have the most evenly spread distribution across grade groups. Since 1996, only APD (the Asia Pacific Department) and EU1 have demonstrated consistent improvement at the B level, whereas support departments as a whole have not been able to improve their developing country staff representation. HRD is the only department that does not employ any B-level staff from developing countries ( Figures 1, 2a, and 2b ;  Table 3  in Attachments).   Fundwide, the most underrepresented regions in higher grades continue to be Africa and the Middle East. Thirteen departments have no B-level African staff and nine departments have no B-level Middle Eastern staff. European nationals are heavily overrepresented at the B level in MED (the Middle East Department), OMD (the Office of the Managing Director), and TRE (the Treasurer's Department), as are U.S. citizens in all support departments, LEG, RES, and TRE. Of all departments, the INS boasts the best nationality balance across grade groups ( Table 4  in Attachments).   Native language bias—specifically English vs. non-English—has become prominent in the diversity dialogue. English-speaking candidates and staff have an advantage in the Fund's work environment, where strong writing skills and persuasive oral communication are crucial competencies. In functional and support departments, career progression to the B level seems to strongly favor English-speaking industrial country backgrounds; in the area departments, other languages are more prominent in the B grades. (4)  In the functional departments, the share of English-speaking industrial country nationals jumps sharply from 32.3 percent of staff in grades A9 to A15 to 57.3 percent in the B grades. In support departments the share increases from 56.4 percent in grade group A9 to A15 to as high as 62.7 percent in the B grades. Area departments have a more balanced share across grade groups ( Figure 5 ;  Table 6  in Attachments).   With respect to gender, in economist departments women's share in higher grades is very low, while staff in grades A1 to A8 are almost exclusively women. In support departments, the gender balance across grade groups is better, though far from ideal. No area department has a ""critical mass"" (30-40 percent) of women in grade groups A9 and above. Functional departments have a somewhat better gender balance in grades A9 to A15 but not in B grades ( Table 2  in Attachments).    Of the area departments, MED has the highest proportion of women economists (28.3 percent) followed by EU1 (26.9 percent), although both of those shares are lower than 1999 levels. Among functional departments, INS, LEG, and TRE each have around 50 percent of women in the professional grades. Support departments have over 50 percent women in those grades. Fundwide, only 11.7 percent of B-level positions are filled by women. Nine departments—AFR (the African Department), EU2, EXR, FAD, INS, MAE, OMD, RES and WHD (the Western Hemisphere Department)—are below the Fund average of women's representation at the B level. Only HRD has managed to reach a critical mass with its 40 percent share of women at the B level ( Figures 3, 4a, and 4b ;  Table 5  in Attachments).   In addition to monitoring data, it is essential to evaluate the whole range of actions surrounding diversity issues to get a full picture. The wealth of diversity data now available allows departments to progress with their diversity agendas independently. In 2000, HRD adopted a new partnership role with departments, including customized service provided by Business Advisors and guidance on staff diversity in coordination with the Diversity Advisor. Overall, the actions undertaken by departments are in line with the recommendations of the 1994 Status of Women in the Fund Study and the 1999 review of individual discrimination cases. Having said that, most departments need to develop bolder diversity initiatives and targeted actions. Departmental diversity actions currently focus on:     Higher recruitment of candidates from underrepresented countries/regions;   Programs for newcomers to ensure an equal and fair start for all;   English language development and guidance to bridge potential cultural and communication gaps, specifically in written communications—a crucial performance component in the Fund;   Individual development and career planning and performance feedback to ensure that staff members have a clear understanding of their own performance level   and realistic expectations of their careerprospects; and   Flexible work arrangements—specifically the CWS—to help balance work and private life needs and reduce stress levels.     A new employee's reputation is established within the first few months on the job, as are his or her impressions of the organization's working culture. Immediate actions and monitoring are therefore needed to address the needs of new staff—particularly those of minority staff members without established networks. Departments have made a lot of progress in that regard. According to the departmental human resource updates of 2000, AFR, APD, EU1, EXR, HRD, MAE, MED, RES, SEC, STA (the Statistics Department), TGS (the Technology and General Services Department), TRE, and WHD offered mentoring programs for newcomers, some of which were supplemented by newcomers' orientation seminars and Starters' Kits. In some departments, however, mentoring programs are so informal and insufficiently communicated that not all new staff receive the information. Matching of mentors and mentees has not always been handled with sufficient care. Only a few departments provide training and guidance to ensure that mentors are aware of the responsibilities and have the necessary skills for the assignment. WHD should be acknowledged for developing a mentoring program for assistants, a staff group that too often is ignored. Overall, departmental mentoring programs are an excellent start and would be even more beneficial if they were better designed and administered. Other commendable efforts on behalf of newcomers—reported in a particular by EU1 and TRE—include the introduction of new staff members on departmental Web sites, Newcomers' Teas, and other welcome events.   The quality of individual development, career planning, and performance management—particularly important to women and minority staff—seems to be improving. Several departments, including APD, EU1, HRD, MED, PDR (the Policy Development and Review Department), STA, and TRE, have developed databases on career experience and mobility of their staff, supplemented by documentation of career development requests expressed by individual staff members. Far too few departments, however, make an extra effort to support their minority staff, which easily leads to cultural biases on the part of both managers and employees. The Diversity Pipeline Reports prepared twice a year by the Diversity Advisor have not been effectively used in many departments. Several departments have increased performance feedback frequency by introducing mid-year feedback discussions and/or improved transparency of performance ratings and merit pay. This is especially beneficial for staff who are less familiar with the Fund's style and working culture. In 1999, APD, EU1, INS, and PDR prepared departmental guidelines for conduct and management, which served as a foundation for Fundwide standards implemented in 2001.   English language skills, specifically writing skills, are essential for Fund staff to perform well.   Most staff from non-native E  "

This continuous increase in workplace diversity will come primarily as a result of the large number of retiring baby boomers (eventually they will all retire) and the growing population of minorities.     Even though minorities will become the  majority  in the United States by 2042, the new census projections indicate that the working age population, defined as the age group from 18 through 64, will be  majority minority  as early as the year 2039.  By mid century,  55 percent  of the working population will be minorities.       Because the US is an  aging nation  (a nation where the overall birthrate is declining quicker than the death rate), the working age population is projected to  steadily decline  to 57 percent of the total population by the year 2050.  In the year 2050, this same working age population will be 30% Hispanic, 12% non-Hispanic Black and 8% non-Hispanic Asian.  Today, the breakdown is 15% Hispanic, 12% Black and 5% Asian.     There are two important milestones to remember here.  First, the size of the workforce relative to the total population will be comparatively  small .  Second, as a result of the shrinking size of the workforce and increase in workforce diversity, as a nation we need to make sure that this new diverse workforce is  prepared .     A key component in the growth of the minority population over the next thirty years will come from the Hispanic population, which is projected to nearly triple, from 46.7 million to 132.8 million from 2008-2050. By 2050, nearly one in three U.S. residents will be Hispanic.     The challenge in preparing minorities for the workforce lies primarily with Hispanics, if only by virtue of the sheer size and  exponential growth of the Hispanic population .  Hispanics fall well behind other minority groups when it comes to education, as they have the  lowest high school and college completion rates  of any racial or ethnic group.  As a nation we need to do more to prepare Hispanics for graduation from high school, college, and to become leaders in the new diversity dominated workforce.     This characteristic of ill preparedness for the workforce is also shared by the African American population, who despite a long term increase in college graduation rates since the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 , the black student college graduation rate remains at a dismally low 44 percent.  Asian Americans, projected to make up the smallest portion of the new diverse workforce in 2050, have the highest college graduation rates in the US, exceeding those of White students in many states.     The new census bureau data makes it clear that changes are sure to come over the next three decades.  Employers and companies armed with this knowledge would be  wise  to extend their  diversity recruiting efforts  and develop community outreach programs to motivate and inspire young minorities to pursue higher education with the goal of becoming the business leaders of tomorrow.  Making  simple investments  in promising diversity students in graduate school, college, and even high school is in the best interests of any company wanting to find and develop the best future business leaders over the next thirty years.                      related stories: Corporate Diversity   Diversity Recruiting   Economics & Demographics   Hispanic population   Majority Minority   Workplace           juan rodriguez's blog              Post new comment           Comment:  *        More information about formatting options   CAPTCHA This question is for testing whether you are a human visitor and to prevent automated spam submissions.

Equity in Employment   The University of Adelaide is an Equal Opportunity Employer and  Employer of Choice for Women .  The principles of equal opportunity employment  are embedded  in our    recruitment and selection  processes and  promotion  processes.   The University of Adelaide’s mission is to be an Australian leader in research and teaching of excellence and to have a positive impact on our students and staff as well as the local, national and international community. Our vision is  to   provide a vibrant intellectual environment that will be satisfying for staff and rewarding for students with a seamless provision of administrative and support services.   Equal Employment Opportunity   As an Equal Opportunity Employer the University of Adelaide is committed to the principles of Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO).     EEO means that all employees have equal access to the opportunities that are available at work. The aim of EEO is to ensure  all employees are treated with fairness and respect in that they are not subject to discrimination or harassment in  the workplace.    EEO does not assume that everyone has the same abilities or that everyone will reach the same levels of  seniority or remuneration. Rather, it requires that everyone be given an equal chance to use their skills and capabilities.   Equal opportunity in the workplace matters because it:     helps  attract and retain the best talent     enhances an organisation’s productivity and innovation    improves workplace relationships     helps  to attract and retain a broader ‘customer base’     reduces an organisation’s risk.     As an Equal Opportunity Employer, the University does not condone any form of  discrimination, and expects all staff to know and to adhere to the related  policies and procedures .

clueweb09-en0005-28-22069	"       December 4,1997      States Now Have the Option to Purchase Food Stamps   to Provide Food Assistance to Legal Immigrants   Stacy Dean  and  Kelly Carmody                Note:  This paper was written prior to the federal restoration of food           stamps for some legal           immigrants, and will be revised soon to reflect the changes           enacted in the new           legislation. Until the paper is revised, please see "" New Federal Food           Stamp Restoration for Legal           Immigrants: Implications and Implementation Issues ""           for a description of which           legal immigrants will be eligible for federal food stamp           benefits effective November 1, 1998.                       On June 12, 1997, Congress passed and the President signed into law the FY1997 supplemental appropriations act (P.L. 105-18  —  see copy of legislation below). This law includes new authority for states to purchase food stamps from the federal government for use in a state-funded food assistance program for legal immigrants (1) . This legislation provides states with important new flexibility to provide food assistance to legal immigrants who are ineligible for federal food stamps under the new welfare law. Without this change, states wishing to aid these immigrants would have faced the prospect of having to establish expensive and burdensome parallel food voucher programs. A state-funded food stamp program is likely to be the most cost-effective means for providing targeted food assistance to vulnerable state residents who will no longer be eligible for federal food stamp benefits.     Eleven states  —   California ,  Florida ,  Illinois ,  Maryland ,  Massachusetts ,  Nebraska ,  New Jersey ,  New York ,  Rhode Island ,  Texas , and  Washington ,  —  have already passed legislation that authorizes the purchase of food stamps for state-funded food assistance.  Minnesota  is providing food assistance in cash but may provide state-funded food stamps in the future. Still other states will be considering legislation to provide state-funded food stamps in the near future. In light of recent congressional action on the federal budget agreement, more states may become interested in providing some form of temporary or ongoing food assistance to low-income immigrants.           Federal food stamps will         not be restored for legal immigrants.   The Balanced Budget Act  enacted on August 5, 1997 does not         restore federal food stamp benefits to any of the legal         immigrants no longer eligible to receive food stamps         under the restrictions established under the Welfare Law (2) .             A significant portion of         legal immigrants will retain their SSI benefits and         Medicaid coverage.  The Balanced Budget Act         reestablishes eligibility for immigrants in three         significant ways. First, it maintains SSI and SSI-related         Medicaid benefits for all legal immigrants who were both         in the country prior to August 22, 1996 and receiving         those benefits. Second, the new law permits legal         immigrants who were in the country as of August 22, 1996         and subsequently become disabled to receive SSI and         Medicaid. Finally, refugees' and asylees' eligibility for         SSI and Medicaid was extended from their first five years         in the United States to their first seven years. In         addition, the bill provides limited benefit eligibility         to other smaller groups of immigrants.      Because many legal immigrants will retain their SSI, the state cost of extending food assistance to legal immigrants will be reduced. The legal immigrant households that would retain their SSI under the budget agreement will still have incomes too low to cover their food needs and will continue to require food assistance. (The federal SSI benefit level for a single individual is only 75 percent of the poverty line.) However, since many will have some income as a result of the expected change in SSI rules, states wishing to fill the assistance gap created by the change in federal food stamp law will face a much lower cost.          States that have set         aside funds for cash assistance for legal immigrants         could consider redirecting some of it to food assistance .         Some states legislatures have considered or passed         legislation that would provide cash assistance to legal         immigrants who lose their SSI benefits. Depending on the         state's legislation, some portion of these funds may no         longer be necessary now that Congress has acted to         continue to provide SSI to some of these immigrants.         Therefore, these states may wish to redirect a portion of         these funds to provide a state-funded food assistance         program for legal immigrants.           Steps Needed to Elect the State Purchase Option     USDA  issued detailed guidance on August 8, 1996 on the specifics of how the state purchase option will work; the basic elements are very simple. A state food stamp agency must inform USDA of the state's desire to purchase food stamps for distribution to immigrants made ineligible by the changes in the welfare law, P.L. 104-193. The state-funded food assistance program for legal immigrants may either follow the design of the federal food stamp program or a design of the state's choosing.     In addition to informing USDA of the nature of the state-funded program, the state must provide USDA with a plan for how it intends to reimburse USDA for the face value of the food stamps issued under the state program and the federal administrative costs associated with operating the state funded program. Once the state and USDA agree to the terms of the reimbursement, the state should be able to start issuing food stamps for its state-funded program shortly thereafter.          Complete Flexibility in Structuring their State-Funded Program     The new legislation does not contain any requirements that the eligibility rules or the structure or level of benefits under a state-funded program remain equivalent to the federal food stamp program. States have tremendous flexibility to design a food assistance program for poor immigrants that meets both their programmatic and budgetary needs. Food stamps are simply the means by which state-funded and state-designed food assistance can be distributed to immigrant households.     Although states can design their own food stamp rules for their state-funded program, a benefit structure that parallels the existing food stamp program is likely to be preferable to most other options for several reasons.          A benefit structure for the         state-funded food assistance program which parallels the         federal food stamp program would be one of the easiest to         administer and would be the least disruptive to immigrant         households. State eligibility workers and food stamp         households are familiar with the current food stamp         program. Workers would not need to learn and to         administer a new set of rules, and state computer systems         would not need to be reprogrammed.             The federal food stamp         benefit ensures that the basic nutritional needs of the         household are met. The food stamp benefit structure is         recognized for its ability to target benefits efficiently         to those households who are least able to purchase food.      However, states could consider a variety of options which would best suit their needs and budgetary constraints. For instance, Maryland's state-funded program will only provide food assistance to low-income immigrant children.         States Could Use TANF Funds and Receive Credit Towards their TANF ""MOE"" for Providing Food Assistance for Some Families    States may want to consider using federal TANF funds to cover some of the cost of purchasing food stamps for certain legal immigrant families. TANF funds may be used to provide assistance to households that include children and that are needy as defined by the state TANF income standards. (Most states have set the TANF income standards below the food stamps standards.) However, if federal TANF funds are used for this purpose, this food assistance will make these families subject to the federal TANF time limits, work participation rates, and other federal TANF prohibitions and requirements. Therefore, states may want to use TANF funds only for those families that are receiving other types of TANF-funded assistance to ensure that the provision of food assistance does not subject families to time limits that will restrict needed help in the future. Similarly, states may not want to use TANF funds for food assistance if the effect would be to bring into TANF work requirements families for whom those requirements may not be appropriate. It may make more sense for the state to use state funds to provide food assistance for these families.    Under  HHS  guidelines, states could receive credit towards their TANF maintenance of effort (MOE) requirement for state funds spent providing food assistance to some legal immigrant households. The assistance provided to eligible families through a state-funded food assistance program is not subject to TANF restrictions such as the 60-month time limit or the work participation rates. (3)  States would be allowed to count funds used to serve legal immigrant households with children whose income falls below the income thresholds in the state's TANF-funded program. This would mean that the state would not receive MOE credit for serving households comprised solely of elderly or disabled legal immigrants. Nor could they count assistance provided to working poor households with children whose income makes the family ineligible for TANF but still leaves them in need of food assistance. Nonetheless, a considerable portion of a state-funded food assistance program could be credited to the TANF MOE. (4)  USDA estimates that some 40 percent of immigrant households who received food stamps in 1995 also received AFDC. Approximately 65 percent of the immigrant households on food stamps during that same year, were households with children.         Requirements for States Choosing to Purchase Coupons    While states have the flexibility to design a state-funded program of their choosing, the legislation does provide some guidelines for states electing to purchase food stamps for use in their own program.           States can only use the         purchase option to provide benefits to individuals made         ineligible for federal food stamp benefits due to the         restrictions on immigrants and the three-month time limit         for childless adults enacted in welfare law. States         cannot purchase food stamps for individuals or households         made ineligible for food stamps under other sections of         the Food Stamp Act, such as a household with income in         excess of the federal eligibility standards.            The legislation requires         states to reimburse the federal government for the value         of the food stamps distributed to legal immigrants as         well as for the costs of printing, distributing,         redeeming, and destroying the food stamps that states         distribute. USDA and many states have experience in         calculating these costs as a part of estimating allowable         administrative costs under EBT. USDA is likely to be         amenable to several different methods of reimbursement,         including a reimbursable agreement or a state letter of         credit against upon which USDA can draw.             States must submit a plan to         USDA detailing on what basis they will issue the         state-purchased coupons, including the eligibility         criteria and the benefit structure. As stated above, the         state has virtually complete flexibility to determine how         their program will work.            States may not charge state         administrative costs incurred under the state-funded         program to the federal food stamp program. Under the         legislation, states must cover the full cost of         certification for these households. Essentially, expenses         incurred in the operation of the state-funded program         would be ""non-allowable"" costs.            All federal penalties         applicable to food stamp fraud and abuse would apply to         the state-purchased food stamps. For instance, if an         individual were caught trafficking food stamps, he or she         would be subject to the same federal penalties regardless         of whether the coupons were federal funded or         state-purchased food stamps.           Associated Federal Administrative Costs Are Not Significant    The total cost of the state purchase option can be split into three pieces: the benefit costs, the state administrative costs and the federal administrative costs. The benefit costs are determined by the benefit structure the state establishes when it creates its state-funded food assistance program. These costs are entirely at the discretion of the state.     State administrative costs are the costs the state incurs in operating the program. They include the time public assistance workers spend interviewing legal immigrant households and the time computing eligibility and benefits. The state would be responsible for these costs and could not charge them to the federal food stamp program as an administrative expense. These administrative costs would be similar to those the state incurs when it operates a state-funded cash assistance program such as General Assistance.     The federal administrative costs are those costs the federal government would incur were a state to elect the state purchase option. The most significant federal administrative cost is that of printing, shipping and redeeming the federal food stamp coupon or the related federal EBT expenses. USDA's guidance states that the Department will charge states 0.28 percent of the total benefit cost ($2,800 per $1 million worth of coupons) for federal administration. This means that if a state elects to operate the state purchase option for a program distributing $10 million annually, its annual federal administrative costs would be $28,000. While there are other related federal administrative costs such as data processing and personnel costs, USDA does not intend to charge states for these costs.         States May Want to Consider Moving Quickly to Elect this Option    This state purchase option is permanently available to all states,  i.e, there is no legal deadline by which states must decide if they will elect the option or not . However, the welfare law terminates federal food stamp assistance to almost one million legal immigrants by August 1997. Among those losing benefits are children, elderly and disabled immigrants, low-income workers, and refugees who have been in the country for more than five years. These terminations are already being phased in and will soon be complete. Also, transitioning current recipients to a state-funded program will be cheaper, easier and more reliable than doing the work to cut them off and then take reapplications. If states wish to continue to provide food assistance to legal immigrants once the federal benefits are eliminated or if they wish to temporarily ""cushion the blow"" of the federal cuts, they will need to act quickly.         Conclusion    This new option for states to purchase food stamps provides states with a cost-effective means for providing targeted food assistance to low-income legal immigrants. Under the new federal law, states can assure that vulnerable low-income residents do not lose critical food assistance.        Pub. L. No. 105-18   June 12, 1997   (Supplemental Appropriations, HR1871)      STATE OPTION TO ISSUE FOOD STAMP BENEFITS TO CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS MADE INELIGIBLE BY WELFARE REFORM     (a) IN GENERAL  —  Section 7 of the Food Stamp Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. 2016) is amended —                      (1) in subsection (a), by         inserting after ""necessary, and"" the following:         ""(except as provided in subsection (j)""; and            (2) by adding at the end         the following:           ''(j) STATE OPTION TO         ISSUE BENEFITS TO CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS MADE INELIGIBLE BY         WELFARE REFORM  —             ''(1) IN GENERAL  —  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a     State agency may, with the approval of the Secretary, issue     benefits under this Act to an individual who is ineligible to     participate in the food stamp program solely as a result of     section 6(o)(2) of this Act or section 402 or 403 of the     Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation     Act of 1996 (8 U.S.C. 1612 or 1613).

End Notes    1.  The new legislation would also permit states to purchase food stamps from the federal government for use in a state-funded food assistance program for individuals subject to the three-month food stamp time limit.     2.  There is one exception. Under the  Balanced Budget Act , Cuban and Haitian Entrants as well as certain Amerasian immigrants will be treated as refugees for the purposes of food stamp eligibility. These immigrants, therefore, would be eligible to receive food stamps for their first five years in the United States.     3.  The federal requirements differ for assistance provided with TANF funds, segregated TANF/state funds, and separate state funds. See  HHS  Policy Announcement No. TANF-ACF-PA-97-1, January 31, 1997; and  Guyer ,  State Funding Requirements Under the New Welfare Law ,  Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , April 15, 1997.     4.  States do not have to serve the families that meet the MOE requirements under a separate food assistance program in order to count the cost of assistance provided to them towards the state's MOE requirement. States can serve all legal immigrants under a state-funded food assistance program and then identify the assistance provided to these families for MOE reporting purposes.

The program operated by    permitting people on relief to buy orange stamps equal to their normal    food expenditures; for every $1 worth of orange stamps purchased, 50    cents worth of blue stamps were received. Orange stamps could be used to    buy any food; blue stamps could only be used to buy food determined by    the Department to be surplus.      Over the course of nearly 4 years, the first    FSP reached approximately 20 million people at one time or another in    nearly half of the counties in the U.S.--peak participation was 4    million--at a total cost of $262 million. The first recipient was Mabel    McFiggin of Rochester, New York; the first retailer to redeem the stamps    was Joseph Mutolo; and the first retailer caught violating the program    was Nick Salzano in October 1939. The program ended ""since the    conditions that brought the program into being--unmarketable food    surpluses and widespread unemployment--no longer existed.""                ""We got a picture of a gorge, with      farm surpluses on one cliff and under-nourished city folks with      outstretched hands on the other. We set out to find a practical      way to build a bridge across that chasm.""                                                                                 ( Milo Perkins )              Pilot Food Stamp Program  - May 29,    1961-1964     The 18 years between the end of the first FSP    and the inception of the next were filled with studies, reports, and    legislative proposals.      Prominent Senators actively associated with    attempts to enact an FSP during this period were: Aiken, La Follette, Humphrey, Kefauver, and Symington. From 1954 on, Congresswoman    Leonor K. Sullivan strove unceasingly to pass food stamp program    legislation. On Sept. 21, 1959, P.L. 86-341 authorized the Secretary of    Agriculture to operate a food stamp system through Jan. 31, 1962.      The Eisenhower Administration never used the    authority. However, in fulfillment of a campaign promise made in West    Virginia, President Kennedy's first Executive Order called for expanded    food distribution and, on Feb. 2, 1961, he announced that food stamp    pilot programs would be initiated. The pilot programs would retain the    requirement that the food stamps be purchased, but eliminated the    concept of special stamps for surplus foods. A Department spokesman    indicated the emphasis would be on increasing the consumption of    perishables.     Mr. and Mrs. Alderson Muncy of Paynesville,    West Virginia, were the first food stamp recipients on May 29, 1961.    They purchased $95 in food stamps for their 15-person household. In the    first food stamp transaction, they bought a can of pork and beans at    Henderson's Supermarket. By January 1964, the pilot programs had    expanded from eight areas to 43 (40 counties, Detroit, St. Louis, and    Pittsburgh) in 22 States with 380,000 participants.                 ""...the Department of Agriculture      seemed bent on outlining a possible food stamp plan of such      scope and magnitude, involving some 25 million persons, as to      make the whole idea seem ridiculous and tear food stamp plans to      smithereens.""                                                  (  Congresswoman Leonor K. Sullivan  )              Food Stamp Act of 1964  - August 31, 1964        On Jan. 31, 1964, President Johnson requested Congress to pass    legislation making the FSP permanent. Secretary Orville Freeman    submitted proposed legislation to establish a permanent FSP on April 17,    1964. The bill eventually passed by Congress was H.R. 10222, introduced    by Congresswoman Sullivan. Among the official purposes of the Food Stamp    Act of 1964 were strengthening the agricultural economy and providing    improved levels of nutrition among low-income households; however, the    practical purpose was to bring the pilot FSP under Congressional control    and to enact the regulations into law. The major provisions were:                                             the State Plan of Operation requirement and     development of eligibility standards by States;                                   the requirement that recipients purchase     their food stamps, paying an amount commensurate with their normal     expenditures for food and receiving an amount of food stamps     representing an opportunity more nearly to obtain a low-cost     nutritionally adequate diet;                                   the eligibility for purchase with food     stamps of all items intended for human consumption except alcoholic     beverages and imported foods (the House version would have     prohibited the purchase of soft drinks, luxury foods, and luxury     frozen foods);                                   prohibitions against discrimination on     bases of race, religious creed, national origin, or political     beliefs;                                   the division of responsibilities between     States (certification and issuance) and the Federal Government     (funding of benefits and authorization of retailers and     wholesalers), with shared responsibility for funding costs of     administration; and                                   appropriations for the first year limited     to $75 million; for the second year, to $100 million; and, for the     third year, to $200 million.                     The Department estimated that participation in    a national FSP would eventually reach 4 million, at a cost of $360    million annually.     Program Expansion - FSP Participation    Milestones in the 1960s and Early 1970s.        In April 1965, participation topped half a million. (Actual    participation was 561,261 people.) Participation topped 1 million in    March 1966, 2 million in October 1967, 3 million in February 1969, 4    million in February 1970, 5 million one month later in March 1970, 6    million two months later in May 1970, 10 million in February 1971, and    15 million in October 1974. Rapid increases in participation during this    period were primarily due to geographic expansion.     Major Legislative Changes - Early 1970s     The early 1970s were a period of growth in    participation; concern about the cost of providing food stamp benefits;    and questions about administration, primarily timely certification. It    was during this time that the issue was framed that would dominate food    stamp legislation ever after: How to balance program access with program    accountability? Three major pieces of legislation shaped this period    leading up to massive reform to follow:          P.L. 91-671 (Jan. 11, 1971) established     uniform national standards of eligibility and work requirements;     required that allotments be equivalent to the cost of a     nutritionally adequate diet; limited households' purchase     requirements to 30 percent of their income; instituted an outreach     requirement; authorized the Department to pay 62.5 percent of     specific administrative costs incurred by States; expanded the FSP     to Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands of the United States;     and provided $1.75 billion appropriations for Fiscal Year 1971.          Agriculture and Consumer Protection Act of 1973 (P.L. 93-86, Aug.     10, 1973) required States to expand the program to every political     jurisdiction before July 1, 1974; expanded the program to drug     addicts and alcoholics in treatment and rehabilitation centers;     established semi-annual allotment adjustments, SSI cash-out, and     bi-monthly issuance; introduced statutory complexity in the income     definition (by including in-kind payments and providing an     accompanying exception); and required the Department to establish     temporary eligibility standards for disasters.           P.L. 93-347 (July 12, 1974) authorized the Department to pay 50     percent of all States' costs for administering the program and     established the requirement for efficient and effective     administration by the States.         1974 Nationwide Program     In accordance with P.L. 93-86, the FSP began    operating Nationwide on July 1, 1974. (The program was not fully    implemented in Puerto Rico until Nov. 1, 1974.) Participation for July    1974 was almost 14 million.      The Food Stamp Act of 1977     Both the outgoing Republican Administration and    the new Democratic Administration offered Congress proposed legislation    to reform the FSP in 1977. The Republican bill stressed targeting    benefits to the neediest, simplifying administration, and tightening    controls on the program; the Democratic bill focused on increasing    access to those most in need and simplifying and streamlining a    complicated and cumbersome process that delayed benefit delivery as well    as reducing errors, and curbing abuse. The chief force for the    Democratic Administration was Robert Greenstein, Administrator of FNS;    on the Hill, major players were Senators McGovern, Javits, Humphrey, and    Dole and Congressmen Foley and Richmond. Amidst all the themes, the one    that became the rallying cry for FSP reform was ""EPR""--eliminate the    purchase requirement--because of the barrier to participation the    purchase requirement represented. The bill that became the law--S.    275--did eliminate the purchase requirement. It also:                                     eliminated categorical eligibility;                                         established statutory income eligibility     guidelines at the poverty line;                                   established 10 categories of excluded     income;                                   reduced the number of deductions used to     calculate net income and established a standard deduction to take     the place of eliminated deductions;                                   raised the general resource limit to     $1,750;                                   established the fair market value (FMV)     test for evaluating vehicles as resources;                                   penalized households whose heads     voluntarily quit jobs;                                   restricted eligibility for students and     aliens;                                   eliminated the requirement that households     must have cooking facilities;                                   replaced store due bills with cash change     up to 99 cents;                                   established the principle that stores must     sell a substantial amount of staple foods if they are to be     authorized;                                   established the ground rules for Indian     Tribal Organization administration of the FSP on reservations; and                                        introduced demonstration project authority.                          In addition to EPR, the Food Stamp Act of 1977    included several access provisions:                                     using mail, telephone, or home visits for     certification;                                   requirements for outreach, bilingual     personnel and materials, and nutrition education materials;                                   recipients' right to submit applications     the first day they attempt to do so;                                   30-day processing standard and inception of     the concept of expedited service;                                   SSI joint processing and coordination with     AFDC;                                   notice, recertification, and retroactive     benefit protections; and                                   a requirement for States to develop a     disaster plan.                     The integrity provisions of the new program    included fraud disqualifications, enhanced Federal funding for States'    anti-fraud activities, and financial incentives for low error rates.        EPR was implemented Jan. 1, 1979. Participation that month increased 1.5    million over the preceding month.                Interesting fact:       The House Report for the 1977 legislation points out that the      changes in the Food Stamp Program are needed without reference      to upcoming welfare reform since ""the path to welfare reform is,      indeed, rocky....""              Cutbacks of the Early 1980s      The large and expensive FSP came under close scrutiny of both the Executive Branch and    Congress in the early 1980s. Major legislation in 1981 and 1982 enacted    cutbacks including:                                     addition of a gross income eligibility test     in addition to the net income test for most households;                                   temporary freeze on adjustments of the     shelter deduction cap and the standard deduction and constraints on     future adjustments;                                   annual adjustments in food stamp allotments     rather than semi-annual;                                   consideration of non-elderly parents who     live with their children and non-elderly siblings who live together     as one household;                                   required periodic reporting and     retrospective budgeting;                                   prohibition against using Federal funds for     outreach;                                   replacing the FSP in Puerto Rico with a     block grant for nutrition assistance;                                   counting retirement accounts as resources;                                        State option to require job search of     applicants as well as participants; and                                   increased disqualification periods for     voluntary quitters.                                Interesting Fact:       Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) began in Reading,      Pennsylvania, in 1984.              The Mid- to Late 1980s     Recognition of the severe domestic hunger    problem in the latter half of the 1980s led to incremental improvements    in the FSP in 1985 and 1987, such as elimination of sales tax on food    stamp purchases, reinstitution of categorical eligibility, increased    resource limit for most households ($2,000), eligibility for the    homeless, and expanded nutrition education. The Hunger Prevention Act of    1988 and the Mickey Leland Memorial Domestic Hunger Relief Act in 1990    foretold the improvements that would be coming. The 1988 and 1990    legislation accomplished the following:                                     increasing benefits by applying a     multiplication factor to Thrifty Food Plan costs;                                   making outreach an optional activity for     States;                                   excluding advance earned income tax credits     as income;                                   simplifying procedures for calculating     medical deductions;                                   instituting periodic adjustments of the     minimum benefit;                                   authorizing nutrition education grants;                                         establishing severe penalties for     violations by individuals or participating firms; and                                   establishing EBT as an issuance     alternative.                     Throughout this era, significant players     were principally various committee chairmen: Congressmen Leland,     Hall, Foley, Panetta, and de la Garza and Senator Leahy.         Development of Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT): 1988-2004     Public Law 100-435, the Hunger Prevention Act    of 1988 was signed into law September 19, 1988 and permitted one or more    pilot projects to test whether the use of benefit cards or other    automated or electronic benefit delivery systems could enhance the    efficiency and effectiveness of program operations for both program    administrators and recipients. Following this initiative, Public Law    101-624, the Mickey Leland Memorial Domestic Hunger Relief Act of    November 28, 1990 established EBT as an issuance alternative and    permitted the Department to continue to conduct EBT demonstration    projects.      On August 10, 1993 the Conference Report on    Public Law 103-66, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993,    included a managers statement strongly urging the Secretary to encourage    State agencies to develop and establish EBT systems. This was followed    by Public Law 104-193, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity    Reconciliation Act of August 22, 1996 which mandated that States    implement EBT systems before October 1, 2002, unless USDA waived the    requirement because a State faced unusual barriers to implementation.        A national standard of interoperability and    portability applicable to electronic food stamp benefit transactions was    established by Public Law 106-171, the Electronic Benefit Transfer    Interoperability and Portability Act of 2000 on February 11, 2000 and    Public Law 107-171, the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002    of May 13, 2002 required USDA to submit a report not later than October    1, 2003 to the House and Senate Agriculture Committees describing the    status of EBT systems in each State. This act also allows group homes    and institutions to redeem EBT benefits directly through banks in areas    where EBT has been implemented rather than going through authorized    wholesalers or other retailers.      Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) is an    electronic system that allows a recipient to authorize transfer of their    government benefits from a Federal account to a retailer account to pay    for products received. EBT is used in all 50 States, the District of    Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Guam. State food stamp agencies    work with contractors to procure their own EBT systems for delivery of    Food Stamp and other state-administered benefit programs.     In EBT systems, food stamp recipients apply for    their benefits in the usual way, by filling out a form at their local    food stamp office. Once eligibility and level of benefits have been    determined, an account is established in the participant's name, and    food stamp benefits are deposited electronically in the account each    month. A plastic card, similar to a bank card, is issued and a personal    identification number (PIN) is assigned or chosen by the recipient to    give access to the account. Recipients are offered the opportunity to    change the PIN number at any time, and are offered ongoing training if    they have any problems accessing the system.      EBT eliminates the cumbersome processes    required by the paper food stamp system. By eliminating paper coupons    which could be lost, sold or stolen, EBT may help cut back on food stamp    fraud. EBT creates an electronic record of each food stamp transaction,    making it easier to identify and document instances where food benefits    are exchanged for cash, drugs, or other illegal goods.      All States are using EBT as an alternative for    food stamp issuance and, in some cases, for other programs such as    USDA's Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and    Children (WIC); and the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF)    program, the Federal block-grant program operated by the Department of    Health and Human Services. As of July 2004, all 50 States, the District    of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Guam operated    state-wide, city-wide, and territory-wide EBT systems to issue food    stamp benefits.      1993 Mickey Leland Childhood Hunger Relief    Act     By 1993, major changes in food stamp benefits    had arrived. The final legislation provided for $2.8 billion in benefit    increases over Fiscal Years 1984-1988. Leon Panetta, in his new role as    OMB Director, played a major role as did Senator Leahy. Substantive    changes included:                                     eliminating the shelter deduction cap     beginning Jan. 1, 1997;                                   providing a deduction for legally binding     child support payments made to nonhousehold members;                                   raising the cap on the dependent care     deduction from $160 to $200 for children under 2 years old and $175     for all other dependents;                                   improving employment and training (E&T)     dependent care reimbursements;                                   increasing the FMV test for vehicles to     $4,550 on Sept. 1, 1994 and $4,600 on Oct. 1, 1995, then annually     adjusting the value from $5,000 on Oct. 1, 1996;                                   mandating asset accumulation demonstration     projects; and                                   simplifying the household definition.                           Later Participation Milestones         In December 1979, participation finally surpassed 20 million. In March    1994, participation hit a new high of 28 million.     The Personal Responsibility and Work    Opportunities Reconciliation Act of 1996     The mid-1990s was a period of welfare reform.    Many States had waivers of the rules for the cash welfare program, Aid    to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) before major welfare reform    legislation was enacted in 1996. The Personal Responsibility and Work    Opportunities Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA) removed the    entitlement of recipients to AFDC and replaced that with a new block    grant to states called Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF).        Although the FSP was    reauthorized in the 1996 Farm Bill, major changes to the program were    enacted through PRWORA. Among them were:                                     eliminating eligibility of most legal     immigrants to food stamps;                                   placing a time limit on food stamp receipt     of three out of 36 months for able-bodied adults without dependents     (ABAWDs) who are not working at least 20 hours a week or     participating in a work program;                                   reduction in maximum allotments by setting     them at 100 percent of the change in the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP)     from 103 percent of the change in the TFP;                                   freezing the standard deduction, the     vehicle limit, and the minimum benefit;                                   setting the shelter cap at graduated     specified levels up to $300 by fiscal year 2001, and permitting     States to make use of the standard utility allowance mandatory;                                   revising provisions for disqualification,     including comparable disqualification with other means-tested     programs; and                                   requiring States to implement EBT before     Oct. 1, 2002.                     The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) and the    Agricultural Research, Education and Extension Act of 1998 (AREERA) made    some changes to these provisions, most significantly:                                     additional Employment and Training (E&T)     funds targeted toward providing work program opportunities for     ABAWDs;                                   allowing States to exempt up to 15 percent     of the estimated number of ABAWDs who would otherwise be ineligible;                                        restoring eligibility for certain elderly,     disabled and child immigrants who resided in the United States when     PRWORA was enacted; and                                   cutting administrative funding for States     to account for certain administrative costs that previously had been     allocated to the AFDC program and now were required to be allocated     to the Food Stamp Program.                     The fiscal year 2001 agriculture appropriations    bill included two significant changes to the FSP. The    legislation increased the excess shelter cap to $340 in fiscal year 2001    and then indexed the cap to changes in the Consumer Price Index for All    Consumers each year beginning in fiscal year 2002. The legislation also    allowed States to use the vehicle limit they use in a TANF assistance    program, if it would be result in a lower attribution of resources for    the household. To date, only two States have not taken advantage of this    option.      Early 2000s - The Farm Bill of 2002     Participation declined throughout the late    1990s, even more so than expected based on the changes in PRWORA and    falling unemployment. Program access and simplification of program rules    were a major focus of proposed legislation and of major regulations    promulgated by the Department. In May 2002, the Food Security and Rural    Investment Act of 2002 was enacted, including reauthorization of the    Food Stamp Program. Major changes to the FSP included:                                        restoration of eligibility for food stamps to qualified       aliens who have been in the United States at least five       years;                                         restoration of eligibility for immigrants receiving certain       disability payments and for children, regardless of how long       they have been the country;                                         adjusting the standard deduction to vary by household size and indexed       each year for inflation;                                         reforming the quality control (QC) system by basing financial       sanctions on consecutive years of high error rate;                                               replacing enhanced funding for States with low error rates with a       performance bonus system based on several different measures       of performance;                                         providing States with several options to simplify the program,       including aligning the definition of income and/or resources       to that used in TANF or Medicaid, adopting a simplified       reporting system, and providing transitional benefits for       clients leaving TANF;                                         cutting E&T funding while eliminating the requirements of targeting       those funds toward ABAWDs; and                                         eliminating the cost neutrality requirement for EBT systems.                      Food stamp participation increased from about    17.2 million in fiscal year 2000 to 26 million people in July 2006. The    rate of payment accuracy in the FSP improved 34 percent between FY2000    and FY2004 and the 94.12 percent overall payment accuracy rate was the    highest achieved since the inception of the program. USDA awarded $48    million to 24 States for their exemplary administration of the program    in fiscal year (FY) 2005.     This improvement in payment accuracy is a    result of strong partnerships with States administering the program as    well as implementation of program simplifications and policy options    provided in the 2002 Farm Bill. These options which include aligning the    definition of income and/or resources to that used in TANF or Medicaid,    adopting a simplified reporting system, and providing transitional    benefits for clients leaving TANF, were well received by State    agencies. Forty-one of these have aligned income and 36 have aligned    resource exclusions to those used in TANF or Medicaid. 47 States have    adopted simplified reporting which has reduced the program error rate.        The Department continues to work with States to    implement the various provisions of the 2002 Farm Bill, through guidance    and regulations.     Late 2000s - The Farm Bill of 2008     By August 2008, participation had reached an    all-time (non-disaster) high of 29 million people per month. The    participation increases occurred at a time when eligibility for food    stamp benefits expanded as a result of the 2002 Farm Bill. Moreover,    there was a consistent focus on outreach and improved access to FSP    benefits. Some of the most recent increase in participation may be    caused by the current economic slowdown and the recent rise in    unemployment rates. During this time, payment accuracy continued to    improve and the program set a new payment error rate record for fiscal    year 2007 of 5.64.         The 2008 farm bill ( H.R.    2419, the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008) was    enacted May 22, 2008 through an override of the President veto. The new law    increased the commitment to Federal food assistance programs by more    than $10 billion over the next 10 years. In efforts to fight stigma,    the law changed the name of the Federal program to the Supplemental    Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP as of Oct. 1, 2008, and changed    the name of the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to the Food and Nutrition Act of    2008. States maintained flexibility to name the program on their own    but were encouraged to change the name to SNAP or another alternate    name. In fact, more than ten States had already changed the names of    their programs by this time.         Significantly, the    2008 Farm Bill also institutionalized priorities that FNS had focused on    for many years including strengthening integrity; simplifying    administration; maintaining State flexibility; improving health through    nutrition education; and improving access.         Benefits were    augmented for most households on Oct. 1, 2008, due to the increase in    the minimum benefit and standard deduction and elimination of the cap on    the deduction for child care expenses. The new law also expanded    eligibility by indexing the asset limits to inflation and excluding    combat pay, and most retirement and education accounts as countable    resources. The law modernized the program by acknowledging EBT as the    standard issuance vehicle and de-obligating coupons one year from    enactment.  The Farm Bill also provided $20 million in mandatory    funding for a project to test point-of-purchase incentives for healthful    foods and authorized appropriations for other similar projects.     Other important changes included:                                           Extended simplified reporting to all households                                        Extended of transitional benefits to those leaving a State-funded       cash assistance program                                         Allowed use of E&T funds for job retention expenses                                        Clarified the E&T volunteers are not subject to a participation limit                                        Stipulated that State agencies must issue monthly benefit allotments to       individuals in one lump sum unless a benefit correction is       necessary                                        Sets standards for expungement of benefits and for moving       benefits off line                                         Clarified that interchange fees may not apply to EBT transactions                                        Required USDA to set standards for major changes in program design                                        Required USDA to require proper testing as a condition of Federal       financial participation in State automation systems.                                        Allowed USDA to prohibit State agencies from collecting       claims from a household and to assert a claim against a       State in cases of major systems failure                                  "

The typical Arkansas diet has too much fat and does  not include enough fruits, vegetables, and whole-grains. This diet, in  conjunction with too little physical activity contributes to the development of  serious health problems.   The Food Stamp Nutrition Education (FSNE) Program is a partnership between  the University of Arkansas  Cooperative Extension Service (UACES), the Arkansas Department of Health & Human  Services, and the USDA Food and Nutrition Service. The FSNE program provides nutrition education  to food stamp recipients and other eligible low-income individuals and families.    The goal of FSNE is to provide educational programs that help food stamp  participants and those eligible for food stamps make healthier food choices and  adopt active lifestyles that are consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for  Americans and USDA Food Guidance System. The program is designed to teach skills  that help participants to:                                                   Buy and prepare healthful meals and snacks based on the Dietary    Guidelines for Americans and USDA Food Guidance System     Become more physically active     Improve safe handling, preparation, and storage of food     Develop spending and savings plans to make food dollars last        throughout the month            FSNE is partnering with the Arkansas Department of Health & Human Services,  Arkansas Department of Health WIC clinics, Head Start programs, senior citizen  centers, commodity distribution sites, and public schools where 50% or more of  the students are eligible for free or reduced price lunch. The FSNE program is  currently delivering nutrition education in 75 counties in the state.   The FSNE educators live in the community and understand the needs of  families. They deliver nutrition education in a variety of ways including:                                                    School programs     Hands-on learning experiences     Food demonstrations     Small group discussions     Educational displays     Handouts     Newsletters                           County Extension agents develop their FSNE program based on specific needs in  individual counties. The focus of most county FSNE programs is targeted to  school-age children and their parents.

The program provides benefits with electronic debit cards, which participants may use to buy food from eligible retailers. The program served about          21.3 million low-income Americans on average each month in fiscal 2003, with an           USDA outlay of about $23.9 billion. The  Food          Assistance and Nutrition Research Program  at ERS studies the Food          Stamp Program and other nutrition programs, including  WIC           and the  child nutrition programs ,           program outcomes ,  vulnerable          populations , the relationship between  food          assistance programs and the general economy ,  program          operations and integrity , and   food          security in the United States .          Features            Food Stamp Nutrition Education (FSNE) —The primary goal of Food Stamp Nutrition Education (FSNE) is to improve the ability of food stamp participants to make healthy food choices and choose active lifestyles consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the Food Guide Pyramid. USDA's Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) began providing funding for FSNE in the early 1990s by matching the dollars a State spends on FSNE activities. This section of the briefing room describes FSNE research activities, provides links to State-level maps and data, and posts tools to assist in assessing the impact of FSNE.         Food              Stamp Program Map Machine —The Food Stamp Program (FSP) Map Machine              is an interactive web-based mapping utility that illustrates program participation              and benefit levels down to the county level. Use the map machine to show              per capita participation, per capita benefits, changes from year to year,              and more. The map's tools allow you to call up tabular data for the county,              State, or Nation. For example, select a State, zoom into a specific county,              and display the data for that county by using the identify tool. Or, zoom              into a region of the United States and display a map showing how rapidly            program participation changed in each county between 1993 and 1997.          Food          Stamp Research Discussion Group —The Food Stamp Research discussion          group (FSP-research) is a communication tool for individuals who conduct          or use research and policy analysis related to the U.S. Food Stamp Program.          This collaborative effort between ERS and USDA's Food and Nutrition Information          Center (FNIC) provides an electronic forum for publication announcements          and for discussion of food stamp data and research methods. Find out more          about the  electronic          discussion group ,  subscribe ,          or view the  archives           on the FNIC web site.         The  Food Stamp Program provisions of the Nutrition Programs Title  in the  2002 Farm Act  reauthorize the program for 5 years. The Act reinstates eligibility for many legal immigrants, increases benefits by raising the standard deduction for many large families, and offers transitional food stamp benefits for families leaving welfare. The Act also contains several new provisions for Food Stamp Program  simplification and administrative reforms .          The Food Assistance Landscape —This periodical provides a brief overview of USDA's domestic food assistance programs. Each issue contains recent program statistics, such as expenditure, participation, and benefit levels, as well as information on related economic and social indicators, such as unemployment rates, income growth, and food price inflation. It also discusses a recent ERS study that examined patterns of entry into and exit from the Food Stamp Program.         Recommended Readings           Prototype Notebook: Short Questions on Dietary Intake, Knowledge, Attitudes, and Behaviors —Assessing the impact of Food Stamp Nutrition Education (FSNE) on the dietary behavior of Food Stamp Program participants is a complex task. Because dietary quality is multifaceted, researchers are challenged to develop measures that assess targeted behaviors, and are suitable for use with program participants. This report provides a compendium of 128 survey questions used in previous research to assess dietary knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors for low-income populations over the age of 18. Each question is presented using a common template including the citations, data sources, data characteristics, and availability of comparable data.          White Papers on Food Stamp          Nutrition Education (FSNE) Evaluation —ERS and the Food and Nutrition          Service (FNS) sponsored this set of papers to support evaluation of nutrition          education provided through FSNE activities. Published in the  Journal          of Nutrition Education , the papers identify tools to assess nutrition          education needs of low-income families and evaluate outcomes of nutrition          education programs directed toward this audience.          Food Stamp Benefits and Childhood Poverty          in the 1990s —In 2000, 8.8 million children received food stamps,          making the Food Stamp Program a significant component in the well-being          of children in many low-income households. To shed light on the efficacy          of food stamps in helping households meet basic needs, ERS researchers          added the value of food stamp benefits to household income and then measured          the effect on child poverty rates. The analysis in this report indicates          that the Food Stamp Program plays an important role in reducing the depth          and severity of poverty.          Issues in Food Assistance —The          Issues in Food Assistance series, part of ERS's Food Assistance and Nutrition          Research Program, addresses a variety of topics related to the USDA food          assistance programs. The series includes several reports relevant to the          Food Stamp Program, including  The          Standard Deduction in the Food Stamp Benefit Formula ,  Assessing          the Self-Sufficiency of Food Stamp Leavers , and  How          Unemployment Affects the Food Stamp Program .           The Summer 2002          issue of  Focus  included papers from a conference sponsored          by ERS and the Institute for Research on Poverty. Several of the papers          are relevant to research on the Food Stamp Program (FSP), including the          conference's title essay, ""Income volatility and the implications          for food assistance programs."" Other papers relevant to the FSP include          "" The role          of food stamps in stabilizing income and consumption ,"" ""Short          recertification periods in the U.S. Food Stamp Program,"" ""Food          stamps and the elderly: Why is participation so low?"" and ""Gateways          into the Food Stamp Program.""

The figures will put the spotlight on hunger when Congress begins deliberations on a new economic stimulus package, said legislators and anti-hunger advocates, predicting that any stimulus bill will include a boost in food stamp benefits. Advocates are also optimistic that President-elect Barack Obama, who made campaign promises to end childhood hunger and whose mother once briefly received food stamps, will make the issue a priority next year.   ""We soon will have the most food stamps recipients in the history of our country,"" said Jim Weill, president of the Food Research and Action Center, a D.C.-based anti-hunger policy organization. ""If the economic forecasts come true, we're likely to see the most hunger that we've seen since the 1981 recession and maybe since the 1960s, when these programs were established.""   The Agriculture Department is set to release the new numbers as early as this week. Agency officials declined to confirm the figures but outlined them in a briefing last month for advocates and administrators of state food stamp programs. Breaking the symbolically important 30 million mark comes on the heels of government data showing that 11.9 million people went hungry in America at some point last year. That included nearly 700,000 children, up more than 50 percent from the year before.   Food pantries and other charitable organizations are also reporting an increase in demand from those in need. Visits to local pantries are up by 20 to 100 percent over the past six months, and calls to the Capital Area Food Bank's hunger hotline have jumped 248 percent. Most are from people who have never used food stamps or a pantry before, said Lynn Brantley, the organization's president and chief executive.   Analysts attribute the jump primarily to rising unemployment, which hit 6.5 percent in October and is predicted to increase to 8 percent by the end of 2009, but rising food costs are also a factor. Although prices have fallen from the levels of this past spring, they remain high. In October, the consumer price index for food and beverages had jumped 6.1 percent over last year. Staples such as eggs and bread rose even faster.   For low-income families, who spend a higher percentage of their monthly budget on food, that rise has been particularly painful. Food stamp benefits are adjusted for inflation only once a year, and as of September, the maximum benefit fell $64 a month short of the cost of the thriftiest, USDA-established diet for a family of four. The annual adjustment in October of 8.5 percent largely brought the benefit in line with food costs again, but the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan policy group, estimates that if current inflation persists, by December benefits will again fail to match the cost of the thrifty food plan.   ""At a time when we have more people turning to the food stamp program, it is less and less able to meet their basic food needs,"" said Stacy Dean, the research center's director of food assistance policy.   To qualify for the food stamp program, whose name was officially changed last month to the Simplified Nutrition Assistance Program, recipients must have an income below 130 percent of the federal poverty level, or less than $27,564 for a family of four. The benefits, which average $109.93 a month per person, are based on a plan set by the government to represent a low-cost but nutritionally adequate diet. Participants apply locally to receive an electronic card that is used like an ATM card to buy food at most grocery stores and some farmers markets. The maximum benefit for a household of four is $588 a month.   At the Department of Human Services on H Street NE yesterday, the benefits office was busy. D.C. resident Harry Washington, 54, had come to apply for food stamps after losing his job at a Dupont Circle restaurant that closed for renovations last month. Over the past three years, he has received food stamps several times to tide him over between jobs. ""This all has been going on awhile. It just depends where you are on the totem pole whether or not you have felt it,"" Washington said.   Jaqueline Hawkins was also there to sign up. The 47-year-old broke her hip last November, forcing her to leave her job at a Whole Foods Market. Hawkins received short-term disability, then unemployment benefits. Both have run out. ""I came for food stamps because my other options have expired,"" she said. Hawkins plans to begin looking for work after Jan. 1.   Benefit applications are up around the Washington area. In the District, the number of applicants in October was up 7.5 percent over last year's. In Arlington County, the average number of food stamp applications in the past six months is up 17 percent over applications during the same period last year.   At the Arlington Food Assistance Center, meanwhile, the number of clients has jumped by 25 to 35 percent over last year, said Executive Director Christine Lucas. Lines for food, sometimes with as many as 95 people, begin forming at about 7:30 a.m., even though the food pantry does not open until 10.   On a recent morning, one of the early arrivers was Alvaro Ascencio. The 45-year-old, who lost his construction job after 12 years, was hopeful he would find work soon and had turned to the pantry as a stopgap. ""If I didn't know about this, I wouldn't know what to do,"" Ascencio said through an interpreter.   To tackle the problem, supportive lawmakers are pressing to include a temporary bump in food stamp benefits in the next stimulus package. Similar proposals failed to pass twice this year, but there appears to be broad support now for an increase of 10 to 20 percent, advocates and lawmakers said.   Economists say an increase in food stamp benefits would help the economy overall by concentrating relief on those most likely to spend the money quickly, pumping dollars into an economy desperate for demand. According to Mark Zandi, chief economist of the rating agency Moody's Economy.com, every $1 spent on food stamp benefits generates $1.73 of economic activity, more than extending unemployment benefits or offering state fiscal relief.   ""Congress has been focusing on the impact on the financial markets,"" said Dean at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. ""We want them to focus on the supermarkets and help 30 million people.""   In 2009, the new Congress will also have to deal with renewing the Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act, which includes school breakfast and lunch programs and the Women, Infants and Children program that provides money for specific foods such as milk and infant formula. The act is due to expire in September 2009, and Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), who chairs the Agriculture Committee, has long been keen to expand eligibility and strengthen mandates for nutritious food in these government-funded programs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               -                                                                                 Proud member of the AFL-CIO                         National Nurses Organizing Committee                         Caregiver and Healthcare Employees Union                          American Association of Registered Nurses                         California Nurses Foundation                       Join us on:    Facebook  |    YouTube  |   Flickr                                                                                                                                                                     CNA/NNOC 2000 Franklin Street, Oakland,                  CA 94612                  Tel: (510) 273-2200 | Fax: (510) 663-1625                                                                                                         © 2008  California Nurses        Association / National Nurses Organizing Committee .

Food Stamp Boost Would Feed Hungry Children and Stimulate Economy         ( Idaho Statesman , January 4, 2009)         In this letter to the editor, Burke Hays, a masters of public health student, points out that increasing food stamp benefits would have a arger positive impacton the economy than tax rebates. According to financial analysts at Goldman Sachs, every dollar in food stamp benefits returns $1.73 in economic activity while only $1.26 in economic activity is generated for each tax rebate dollar. In addition, 90 percent of food stamp cash benefits are spent within two weeks of receipt by the poorest Americans, while middle- and upper-income tax rebate recipients take much longer to spend their cash, if they spend it at all. During this economic downturn, with many households struggling to purchase food, children are suffering from hunger; a boost to food stamps is also n investment in our neediest and hungriest children.Childhood hunger can lead to chronic illness, behavioral issues, and psychiatric stress, according to a study from the journal Pediatrics. The American Journal of Public Health found that hungry children are more likely to perform poorly in school, experience difficulty in extending their education beyond secondary school, and have trouble getting adequate employment. Hays concludes by urging people to contact their Congresspersons and ell them to extend food stamp benefits to struggling Americans. Doing so will go a long way toward feeding hungry children and reviving our economy./p>                               2. Federal Aid Not State Budget Cuts Necessary to Help Economy         ( Fort Wayne Journal Gazette , January 2, 2009)          This op-ed piece, which ran in the Fort Wayne Journal Gazette, refers to a recent New York Times editorial by 2008 Nobel Prize winning economist Paul Krugman, which warned that governors are cutting budgets the same way that Herbert Hoover did in 1932 in order to balance the federal budget. These cuts are hurting the most vulnerable sector of society, and Krugman suggested that Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland approach to the economy alling for federal aid to the state for food stamps and Medicaid, for state and local infrastructure and for educationis the right path to take. According to this op-ed, Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, and the state new Family and Social Services Administration (FSSA) chief Anne Waltermann Murphy, should call for the same kinds of support, especially food stamps and Medicaid, and refrain from hredding the social safety net at a moment when many more Americans need help FSSA chief Murphy takes over running the agency from Mitch Roob, whose 10-year, $1.6 billion outsourced contract for social services has been criticized for keeping needy Indiana residents from receiving food stamps and other aid.                                 3. Economy Drives Up SNAP/Food Stamp Participation                 Iowa      ( Chicago Tribune , December 30, 2008;  The Gazette , December 29, 2008)     More than 128,000 Iowans received food assistance in November 2008, and the number of households in the state receiving food aid and other assistance grew 15 percent from November 2007. The number of households receiving only food assistance grew 25 percent over the past year. Officials say the increase from July through September was the result of disaster relief from tornadoes and flooding. However, the economy has been driving the increase since October, according to Ann Wiebers, administrator of the human services division of financial, health and work support. From July through November 2008, the state distributed $28.9 million in food stamps, a 33 percent increase from the previous year. Cedar Rapids resident Lela Julis, a ood aidrecipient, said changes in the program from the switch to EBT cards to being able to redeem benefits at farmersmarkets have helped. High prices had forced her to buy hings that aren good for youbecause theye cheaper, and she wanted to buy more fresh fruits and vegetables. Julis appreciated being able to use her benefits at the farmersmarket, noting that it s cheaper than the grocery store.                 West Virginia      ( Louisville Courier-Journal , December 16, 2008)     One-sixth of West Virginia population more than 281,000 residents receive federal food assistance through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, which is the new federal name for the Food Stamp Program). Across the country, one in 10 Americans now receive the benefit, an all-time high as the conomy worsens and more people are out of work.West Virginia neighboring states also reported food stamp enrollment increases since September 2007, including Kentucky (7 percent climb), Virginia (9 percent), and Maryland (16 percent).                 Maryland      ( Maryland Gazette , December 10, 2008)     Maryland historic 16 percent increase in Food Supplement (the state new name for the Food Stamp Program) participation means that 389,300 people now receive the benefit, according to the state Department of Human Resources. The numbers have been climbing steadily from month to month according to officials. Anne Arundel County is experiencing the fastest growth in numbers 26 percent as more people in the county are applying after being laid off, or are dealing with consumer price increases. Outreach strategies have brought in new recipients, especially a partnership with the county Department of Aging to get more elderly and disabled residents signed up for assistance.                 Massachusetts      ( Boston Herald , December 28, 2008)     SNAP/Food Stamp numbers grew from November 2007 to 2008 going from 253,048 to 300,000 recipients as the recession, combined with a huge outreach project, expanded statewide enrollment. Officials credit about 20 percent of the increase to the outreach effort, which included outreach at senior expos to sign up eligible elderly residents who had not enrolled. Also, a state program providing cash assistance titled Emergency Aid to Elders, Disabled and Children (EAEDC) saw an increase of 9.4 percent, going from 17,389 in November 2007 to 19,023 in November 2008. During the same period, the state largest welfare program Transitional Aid to Families with Dependent Children (TAFDC) grew 3.2 percent, from 45,736 to 47,226 households. For years, caseloads for all these programs had either declined or leveled off. In addition, Gov. Deval Patrick cut funding for cash aid programs during emergency cuts made in October, with EAEDC reduced by $381,000, and TAFDC by $4.5 million.                 New Jersey      ( Newark Star-Ledger , January 4, 2009)     In October 2008 the number of food stamp applications doubled compared to the year before. Driven by the recession, the increase saw 4,547 people apply for food stamps in October 2008; in October 2007, 2,234 people applied. Still, a Mathematica report found that in 2006, only 60 percent of the state eligible residents applied for the benefit, which is below the nation average of 67 percent. The October increase is seen as encouraging by Adele LaTourette, director of the Statewide Emergency Food and Anti-Hunger Network, since many people who are eligible for assistance often don apply for help. e really need to be getting people into the (food stamp) program,said LaTourette.                                   4. New York Gov. Announces Increases for Food Assistance Program in Spite of State Budget Cuts         ( Albany Times Union blog , January 2, 2009)          Saying it ratifying to be in a position to provide additional funding for food assistance providersat a time when he must propose significant budget cuts, New York Gov. David Paterson announced an emergency increase in funding of $1 million for regional food banks across the state, and noted the state has received an additional $365 million in federal food stamp funding over the last 15 months. In November, the state food stamp enrollment reached a record high of 2.1 million individuals, an increase over the past year of 300,000 individuals. In a press release, the Governor said that groups that traditionally do not participate  seniors, disabled people, families with children, the unemployed, and head of household college students are seeking food stamps in increasing numbers. Also, changes in the program have made more low-income working families eligible. Calling hunger and the lack of nutrition a public health threat, State Department of Health Commissioner Richard F. Daines, M.D., thanked the Governor for moving the state uickly to avert a hunger crisis.Streamlined access to the food stamp program increased enrollment, and shows hat those who need these benefits are getting them,said Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance Commissioner David A. Hansell. He added orking families are struggling enough these days, and should not have to struggle to get the benefits to which they are entitled.In streamlining the process, the state has raised the income limit from 130 percent to 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Level, waived face-to-face interviews and finger-imaging requirements for certain households, eliminated the resource test for nearly all applicants, instituted telephone interviews for renewal of benefits, and created a Web site www.mybenefits.ny.gov where residents of 12 counties can apply for the benefit online.                                    5. Legal Aid Vital to Survival of New York Poor         ( New York Times , January 1, 2009)         While Gov. Peterson $121 billion oomsday budgetdoes not single out any one program for elimination and guards against any interest groups putting heir needs above the stability and solvency of New York State,this editorial points out that officials should keep in mind that the poor will suffer the most from the lack of funding for legal aid services in the new budget. Advocates point to the significant returns for relatively modest financial outlay, as legal services for poor residents keeps their mortgages from foreclosure, lowers the number of evictions and keeps many families and individuals from becoming homeless. Avoiding litigation keeps the load on judges and courtrooms manageable. Legal aid also helps needy residents access food stamps. By avoiding he poor house,New York needy ill haveore money to spend, increasing sales tax revenues and benefiting local businesses./p>                                  6.

Massachusetts Schools See Increase in Free and Reduced-Price Lunch Numbers         ( Milford Daily News , December 28, 2008)          School food service directors in Massachusetts are reporting increased numbers of children applying for and receiving free and reduced-price lunch. ive years ago, parents wouldn do it, but now they want to put (in) an application,said Framingham Food Services Director Brendan Ryan. Bellingham director Kyle Parson noticed an increase since September, and attributes it to tough times, layoffs, and people struggling with paying bills. Franklin Food Service Director Clair Doyle expects more to sign up, as  applications come in every day. et face it,she said, he economy is terrible and people need it.These trends mirror those nationwide as reported in the School Nutrition Association (SNA) recently-published study aved by the Lunch Bell: As Economy Sinks, School Nutrition Program Participation Rises,which found that 425,000 more students are participating in school lunch and breakfast programs this year than in previous school years. SNA, which represents workers providing school meals, found almost 80 percent of schools surveyed nationally reported increases in school lunches served.                                   8. Barriers Keep Massachusetts from Increasing School Breakfast Participation         ( Boston Globe , January 4, 2009)          Only 34 percent of eligible low-income children in Massachusetts take advantage of free- and reduced-price breakfast according to Project Bread, and only half of Boston students receive the free or reduced-price breakfasts. Nutrition and education advocates cite barriers to participation, including         - Only 48 percent of schools those with the neediest students must serve breakfast. Schools not offering the meal say they can cover the meal costs not picked up by the federal government. (All public schools must offer free lunch to qualifying students.)  - Not all parents know school breakfast is available.  - Students travelling long distances to school arrive too late for the meal.  - Some children feel stigmatized by accepting free breakfast and while studies have shown that in-classroom breakfast to all students removes the stigma, some schools are reluctant to spend instruction time on feeding students, due to educational mandates.         Ensuring children eat a nutritious breakfast is likely the best investment i]n terms of producing good outcomes for kidssaid J. Larry Brown of the Harvard School of Public Health and senior author of the recent report mpact of School Breakfast on Children Health and Learning.The study findings mirror the impact felt by one elementary school student, who said that without breakfast  sit there for 10 minutes trying to figure out the question. My belly would be grumbling while waiting for lunch.According to Project Bread, free school meals can save a family with two young children about $1,450 a year.                           9. Beverage Tax, Other Measures Battle Obesity         ( Santa Rose Press Democrat , December 28, 2008)          In 2009, New Yorkers could pay an 18 percent tax on non-diet sodas and other sugar-filled drinks if a controversial plan to fight obesity proposed by Gov. David Paterson is put in place. The tax is expected to reduce high-calorie drink consumption by an estimated 5 percent, and help fight the budget deficit by generating $404 million in its first year. According to the Center for Science in the Public Interest, sugary drinks are the ingle biggest contributor to calories in the American diet.Numerous research studies have linked sugared sodas to obesity and diabetes. New York governor is also planning additional high-calorie food taxes. California passed a state law mandating menu labeling, similar to one in New York, that requires fast-food chains to prominently post calorie counts. And in South Los Angeles, which has a high obesity rate, legislation prohibits the opening of new fast-food restaurants.                        10. South Carolina Governor Agrees to Continue Funding Unemployment Benefits         ( New York Times , January 1, 2009)          Called eartlessand criticized by fellow Republicans for initially refusing to ask for $146 million in federal funds to bolster the state almost-empty unemployment benefits fund, South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford agreed to apply for the funds. Currently the state has the third-highest unemployment rate in the nation, with 77,000 residents jobless. While legislators said that they couldn recall any other governor efusing to ask for unemployment funds,Gov. Sanford refused for weeks to ask, saying he did not trust the unemployment rate calculated by the state unemployment agency. Had the Governor not requested the additional funds, the state would have stopped cutting unemployment checks. e will not punish the unemployed for this agency incompetence,said Sanford about his decision change at a news conference. He continues to ask for an audit of the unemployment office, although other legislators question the need.

CWLA recommends that foster care caseworkers have case-loads of 12-15 children.52     REFERENCES            U.S. Bureau of the Census, Population Division. (2006).

FSP is the federal government's most targeted attempt to decrease food insecurity. The mission of the program is to end hunger and  improve nutrition and health by providing low-income citizens with the resources necessary to purchase food.    Calls for an increase in the minimum wage often cite increased food stamp utilization as a primary signal in favor of an increase.   In reality, the vast majority of food stamp recipients do not participate in the full-time labor force.  A 2001 report analyzing the  characteristics of food stamp recipients shows that only 26 percent of recipient households reported any level of earned income while  receiving food stamps.  Sixty-nine percent of recipient households report only unearned income in the form of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), general assistance, SSI,  social security and other sources.  Increasing the minimum wage will do nothing to help these individuals and may actually hurt  their attempts to secure employment and move towards self-sufficiency.       In order to determine eligibility for food stamps, the following criteria are utilized:      Resources:   According to the USDA guidelines, a household can have up to $2,000 in countable resources, or $3,000 if at least one person in the household is over 60 or disabled.  Resources such as home and lot, supplemental security income, TANF payments and many retirement plans are not counted towards allowable resources.  The fair market value of a licensed automobile worth over $4,650 is counted as a resource.  A licensed vehicle is not counted as a resource if it is used for an income-producing purpose, it is annually producing income consistent with its fair market value, it is needed for long-distance travel for work, it is used as a home, it is needed to transport a physically disabled household member, it is needed to carry most of the household's fuel and water, or if the household has little equity in the vehicle.       Income:   Participation in the FSP is contingent on certain net and gross income limits.     Deductions:   In order to determine the net income figure used for the calculation of benefits, the FSP allows certain deductions. These include: 20 percent of earned income, a standard $134 deduction for all households, a dependent care deduction, uncovered medical expenses exceeding $35 a month, legally owed child support, and excess shelter costs that are more than half of the household's income after other deductions, up to a limit of $354.

clueweb09-enwp00-76-18579	"                     Food Stamp Program          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Food Stamps/WIC )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search                    The examples and perspective in this article  deal primarily with the  United States  and do not represent a  worldwide view  of the subject . Please  improve this article  or discuss the issue on the  talk page .       The US  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program [ 1 ] , historically and commonly known as the  Food Stamp Program , is a  federal assistance  program that provides food to low and no income people living in the  United States . Benefits are distributed by the individual states, but the program is administered through the  U.S. Department of Agriculture . Most food stamp benefits are now distributed using cards but for most of its history the program had actually used paper denominational stamps/coupons worth $1, $5, and $10. These stamps could be used to purchase any prepackaged edible foods regardless of nutritional value (for example  soft drinks  and  confectionery  could be purchased on food stamps). In the late 1990s, the food stamp program was revamped and actual stamps were phased out in favor of a specialized debit card system known as  Electronic Benefit Transfer  (EBT) provided by private contractors. Many states merged the use of the EBT card for public assistance welfare programs as well. The successful replacement over time of all paper food stamps by EBT cards enabled Congress to rename the Food Stamp Program to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, as of October 2008, and update all references in federal law from ""stamp"" or ""coupon"" to ""card"" or ""EBT"". This was effectuated by H.R. 2419, The Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (a/k/a ""2008 Farm Bill"") passed into law as Public Law No: 110-234, over President Bush's veto. [1]   The number of Americans receiving food stamps reached 31.5 million in September 2008 (10.3% of the total USA population), the highest absolute number since the program began in 1962; but the highest ratio was reached in 1994 with 10.5% of the American population. [ 2 ]  Recipients must have near-poverty incomes to qualify for benefits.

Of the program, Perkins said, ""We got a picture of a gorge, with farm surpluses on one cliff and under-nourished city folks with outstretched hands on the other. We set out to find a practical way to build a bridge across that chasm."" The program operated by permitting people on  relief  to buy orange stamps equal to their normal food expenditures; for every $1 worth of orange stamps purchased, 50 cents worth of blue stamps were received. Orange stamps could be used to buy any food; blue stamps could be used only to buy food determined by the Department to be surplus. Over the course of nearly 4 years, the first FSP reached approximately 20 million people at one time or another in nearly half of the counties in the U.S. at a total cost of $262 million. At its peak, the program assisted 4 million people simultaneously. The first recipient was Mabel McFiggin of  Rochester, New York ; the first retailer to redeem the stamps was Joseph Mutolo; and the first retailer caught violating program rules was Nick Salzano in October 1939. The program ended when the conditions that brought the program into being (unmarketable food surpluses and widespread unemployment) no longer existed.     [ edit ]   Pilot Food Stamp Program - May 29, 1961-1964   The 18 years between the end of the first FSP,DSP,and the inception of the next were filled with studies, reports, and legislative proposals. Prominent Senators actively associated with attempts to enact a food stamp program during this period are  Aiken , La Follette,  Humphrey ,  Kefauver , and  Symington . From 1954 on, Congresswoman  Leonor Sullivan  strove unceasingly to pass food stamp program legislation. On  September 21 ,  1959 , P.L. 86-341 authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to operate a food stamp system through  January 31 ,  1962 . The  Eisenhower  Administration never used the authority. However, in fulfillment of a campaign promise made in  West Virginia , President  Kennedy 's first Executive Order called for expanded food distribution and, on  February 2 ,  1961 , he announced that food stamp pilot programs would be initiated. The pilot programs would retain the requirement that the food stamps be purchased, but eliminated the concept of special stamps for surplus foods. A Department spokesman indicated the emphasis would be on increasing the consumption of perishables.   Mr. and Mrs. Alderson Muncy of Paynesville, West Virginia, were the first food stamp recipients on  May 29 ,  1961 . They purchased US$95 in food stamps for their 15-person household. In the first food stamp transaction, they bought a can of  pork and beans  at Henderson's Supermarket. By January 1964, the pilot programs had expanded from eight areas to 43 (40 counties,  Detroit ,  St. Louis , and  Pittsburgh ) in 22 States with 380,000 participants.   Of the program, Congresswoman Leonor K. Sullivan asserted, ""...the Department of Agriculture seemed bent on outlining a possible food stamp plan of such scope and magnitude, involving some 25 million persons, as to make the whole idea seem ridiculous and tear food stamp plans to smithereens."" [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Food Stamp Act of 1964 - August 31, 1964   On  January 31 ,  1964 , President  Johnson  requested Congress to pass legislation making the FSP permanent. Agriculture Secretary  Orville Freeman  submitted proposed legislation to establish a permanent FSP on  April 17 ,  1964 . The bill eventually passed by  Congress  was H.R. 10222, introduced by Congresswoman Sullivan. One of the members on the House Committee on Agriculture who voted against the FSP in Committee was then Representative  Bob Dole . As a Senator, Mr. Dole became a staunch supporter of the Program. Among the official purposes of the Food Stamp Act of 1964 were strengthening the agricultural economy and providing improved levels of nutrition among low-income households; however, the practical purpose was to bring the pilot FSP under Congressional control and to enact the regulations into law. The major provisions were:     The State Plan of Operation requirement and development of eligibility standards by States;   They required that the recipients should purchase their food stamps, while paying the average money spent on food then receiving an amount of food stamps representing an opportunity more nearly to obtain a low-cost nutritionally adequate diet;   The eligibility for purchase with food stamps of all items intended for human consumption except alcoholic beverages and imported foods (the House version would have prohibited the purchase of soft drinks, luxury foods, and luxury frozen foods);   Prohibitions against discrimination on bases of race, religious creed, national origin, or political beliefs;   The division of responsibilities between States (certification and issuance) and the Federal Government (funding of benefits and authorization of retailers and wholesalers), with shared responsibility for funding costs of administration; and   Appropriations for the first year limited to $75 million; for the second year, to $100 million; and, for the third year, to $200 million.     The Agriculture Department estimated that participation in a national FSP would eventually reach 4 million, at a cost of $360 million annually.     [ edit ]   Program Expansion - FSP Participation Milestones in the 1960s and Early 1970s.   In April 1965, participation topped half a million. (Actual participation was 561,261 people.) Participation topped 1 million in March 1966, 2 million in October 1967, 3 million in February 1969, 4 million in February 1970, 5 million one month later in March 1970, 6 million two months later in May 1970, 10 million in February 1971, and 15 million in October 1974. Rapid increases in participation during this period were primarily due to geographic expansion.     [ edit ]   Major Legislative Changes - Early 1970s   The early 1970s were a period of growth in participation, concern about the cost of providing food stamp benefits, and questions about administration, primarily timely certification. It was during this time that the issue was framed that would dominate food stamp legislation ever after: How to balance program access with program accountability? Three major pieces of legislation shaped this period leading up to massive reform to follow:   P.L. 91-671 ( January 11 ,  1971 ) established uniform national standards of eligibility and work requirements; required that allotments be equivalent to the cost of a nutritionally adequate diet; limited households' purchase requirements to 30 percent of their income; instituted an outreach requirement; authorized the Agriculture Department to pay 62.5 percent of specific administrative costs incurred by States; expanded the FSP to  Guam ,  Puerto Rico , and the  Virgin Islands  of the United States; and provided $1.75 billion appropriations for Fiscal Year 1971.   Agriculture and Consumer Protection Act of 1973 (P.L. 93-86,  August 10 ,  1973 ) required States to expand the program to every political jurisdiction before  July 1 ,  1974 ; expanded the program to drug addicts and alcoholics in treatment and rehabilitation centers; established semi-annual allotment adjustments, SSI cash-out, and bi-monthly issuance; introduced statutory complexity in the income definition (by including in-kind payments and providing an accompanying exception); and required the Department to establish temporary eligibility standards for disasters.   P.L. 93-347 ( July 12 ,  1974 ) authorized the Department to pay 50 percent of all States' costs for administering the program and established the requirement for efficient and effective administration by the States.     [ edit ]   1974 Nationwide Program   In accordance with P.L. 93-86, the FSP began operating Nationwide on  July 1 ,  1974 . (The program not fully implemented in Puerto Rico until  November 1 ,  1974 .) Participation for July 1974 was almost 1.4 million.     [ edit ]   The Food Stamp Act of 1977   Both the outgoing Republican Administration and the new Democratic Administration offered Congress proposed legislation to reform the FSP in 1977. The Republican bill stressed targeting benefits to the neediest, simplifying administration, and tightening controls on the program; the Democratic bill focused on increasing access to those most in need and simplifying and streamlining a complicated and cumbersome process that delayed benefit delivery as well as reducing errors, and curbing abuse. The chief force for the Democratic Administration was Robert Greenstein, Administrator of FNS; in Congress, major players were Senators  McGovern ,  Javits , Humphrey, and Dole and Congressmen Foley and Richmond. Amidst all the themes, the one that became the rallying cry for FSP reform was ""EPR"" -- eliminate the purchase requirement -- because of the barrier to participation the purchase requirement represented. The bill that became the law (S. 275) did eliminate the purchase requirement. It also:     eliminated categorical eligibility;   established statutory income eligibility guidelines at the poverty line;   established 10 categories of excluded income;   reduced the number of deductions used to calculate net income and established a standard deduction to take the place of eliminated deductions;   raised the general resource limit to $1,750;   established the fair market value (FMV) test for evaluating vehicles as resources;   penalized households whose heads voluntarily quit jobs;   restricted eligibility for students and aliens;   eliminated the requirement that households must have cooking facilities;   replaced store due bills with cash change up to 99 cents;   established the principle that stores must sell a substantial amount of staple foods if they are to be authorized;   established the ground rules for Indian Tribal Organization administration of the FSP on reservations; and   introduced demonstration project authority.     In addition to EPR, the Food Stamp Act of 1977 included several access provisions:     using mail, telephone, or home visits for certification;   requirements for outreach, bilingual personnel and materials, and nutrition education materials;   recipients' right to submit applications the first day they attempt to do so;   30-day processing standard and inception of the concept of expedited service;   SSI joint processing and coordination with AFDC;   notice, recertification, and retroactive benefit protections; and   a requirement for States to develop a disaster plan.     The integrity provisions of the new program included fraud disqualifications, enhanced Federal funding for States' anti-fraud activities, and financial incentives for low error rates.   The House Report for the 1977 legislation points out that the changes in the Food Stamp Program are needed without reference to upcoming welfare reform since ""the path to welfare reform is, indeed, rocky....""   EPR was implemented  January 1 ,  1979 . Participation that month increased 1.5 million over the preceding month.     [ edit ]   Cutbacks of the Early 1980s   The large and expensive FSP proved to be a favorite subject of close scrutiny from both the Executive Branch and Congress in the early 1980s. Major legislation in 1981 and 1982 enacted cutbacks including:     addition of a gross income eligibility test in addition to the net income test for most households;   temporary freeze on adjustments of the shelter deduction cap and the standard deduction and constraints on future adjustments;   annual adjustments in food stamp allotments rather than semi-annual;   consideration of non-elderly parents who live with their children and non-elderly siblings who live together as one household;   required periodic reporting and retrospective budgeting;   prohibition against using Federal funds for outreach;   replacing the FSP in Puerto Rico with a block grant for nutrition assistance;   counting retirement accounts as resources;   State option to require job search of applicants as well as participants; and   increased disqualification periods for voluntary quitters.     Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) began in  Reading ,  Pennsylvania , in 1984.     [ edit ]   The Mid- to Late 1980s   Recognition of the severe domestic hunger problem in the latter half of the 1980s led to incremental expansions of the FSP in 1985 and 1987, such as elimination of sales tax on food stamp purchases, reinstitution of categorical eligibility, increased resource limit for most households ($2,000), eligibility for the homeless, and expanded nutrition education. The Hunger Prevention Act of 1988 and the Mickey Leland Memorial Domestic Hunger Relief Act in 1990 foretold the improvements that would be coming. The 1988 and 1990 legislation accomplished the following:     increasing benefits by applying a multiplication factor to Thrifty Food Plan costs;   making outreach an optional activity for States;   excluding advance earned income tax credits as income;   simplifying procedures for calculating medical deductions;   instituting periodic adjustments of the minimum benefit;   authorizing nutrition education grants;   establishing severe penalties for violations by individuals or participating firms; and   establishing EBT as an issuance alternative.     Throughout this era, significant players were principally various committee chairmen: Congressmen Leland, Hall, Foley, Panetta, and de la Garza and Senator  Leahy .     [ edit ]   1993 Mickey Leland Childhood Hunger Relief Act   By 1993, major changes in food stamp benefits had arrived. The final legislation provided for $2.8 billion in benefit increases over Fiscal Years 1984-1988. Leon Panetta, in his new role as OMB Director, played a major role as did Senator Leahy. Substantive changes included:     eliminating the shelter deduction cap beginning  January 1 ,  1997 ;   providing a deduction for legally binding child support payments made to nonhousehold members;   raising the cap on the dependent care deduction from $160 to $200 for children under 2 years old and $175 for all other dependents;   improving employment and training (E&T) dependent care reimbursements;   increasing the FMV test for vehicles to $4,550 on  September 1 ,  1994  and $4,600 on  October 1 ,  1995 , then annually adjusting the value from $5,000 on  October 1 ,  1996 ;   mandating asset accumulation demonstration projects; and   simplifying the household definition.       [ edit ]   Later Participation Milestones   In December 1979, participation finally surpassed 20 million. In March 1994, participation hit a new high of 28 million.     [ edit ]   The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunities Reconciliation Act of 1996   The mid-1990s was a period of welfare reform. Many states had waivers of the rules for the cash welfare program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) before major welfare reform legislation was enacted in 1996. The  Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act  of 1996 (PRWORA) removed the entitlement of recipients to AFDC and replaced that with a new block grant to states called  Temporary Assistance to Needy Families  (TANF).   Although the Food Stamp Program was reauthorized in the 1996 Farm Bill, major changes to the program were enacted through PRWORA. Among them were:     eliminating eligibility of most legal immigrants to food stamps;   placing a time limit on food stamp receipt of three out of 36 months for able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs) who are not working at least 20 hours a week or participating in a work program;   reduction in maximum allotments by setting them at 100 percent of the change in the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) from 103 percent of the change in the TFP;   freezing the standard deduction, the vehicle limit, and the minimum benefit;   setting the shelter cap at graduated specified levels up to $300 by fiscal year 2001, and permitting States to make use of the standard utility allowance mandatory;   revising provisions for disqualification, including comparable disqualification with other means-tested programs; and   requiring States to implement EBT before  October 1 ,  2002 .     The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) and the Agricultural Research, Education and Extension Act of 1998 (AREERA) made some changes to these provisions, most significantly:     additional Employment and Training (E&T) funds targeted toward providing work program opportunities for ABAWDs;   allowing States to exempt up to 15 percent of the estimated number of ABAWDs who would otherwise be ineligible;   restoring eligibility for certain elderly, disabled and child immigrants who resided in the United States when PRWORA was enacted; and   cutting administrative funding for States to account for certain administrative costs that previously had been allocated to the AFDC program and now were required to be allocated to the Food Stamp Program.     The fiscal year 2001 agriculture appropriations bill included two significant changes to the Food Stamp Program. The legislation increased the excess shelter cap to $340 in fiscal year 2001 and then indexed the cap to changes in the Consumer Price Index for All Consumers each year beginning in fiscal year 2002. The legislation also allowed States to use the vehicle limit they use in a TANF assistance program, if it would be result in a lower attribution of resources for the household.     [ edit ]   The Farm Bill of 2002   Participation declined throughout the late 1990s, even more so than expected based on the changes in PRWORA and falling unemployment. Program access and simplification of program rules were a major focus of proposed legislation and of major regulations promulgated by the Department. In May 2002, the Food Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 was enacted, including reauthorization of the Food Stamp Program. Major changes to food stamps included:     restoration of eligibility for food stamps to qualified aliens who have been in the United States at least five years;   restoration of eligibility for immigrants receiving certain disability payments and for children, regardless of how long they have been the country;   adjusting the standard deduction to vary by household size and indexed each year for inflation;   reforming the quality control (QC) system by basing financial sanctions on consecutive years of high error rate;   replacing enhanced funding for States with low error rates with a performance bonus system based on several different measures of performance;   providing States with several options to simplify the program, including aligning the definition of income and/or resources to that used in TANF or  Medicaid , adopting a simplified reporting system, and providing transitional benefits for clients leaving TANF;   cutting E&T funding while eliminating the requirements of targeting those funds toward ABAWDs; and   eliminating the cost neutrality requirement for EBT systems.     Food stamp participation began to increase in fiscal year 2001 and has continued to rise through the beginning of fiscal year 2003. The Department continues to work with States to implement the various provisions of the Farm Bill, through guidance and regulations.     [ edit ]   Statistics   According to the  United States Department of Agriculture , statistics for the food stamp program are as follows: [ 4 ]     51 percent of all participants are children (17 or younger), and 65 percent of them live in single-parent households.   55 percent of food stamp households include children.   9 percent of all participants are elderly (age 60 or over).   79 percent of all benefits go to households with children, 14 percent go to households with disabled persons, and 7 percent go to households with elderly persons.   36 percent of households with children were headed by a single parent, the overwhelming majority of whom were women.   The average household size is 2.3 persons.   The average gross monthly income per food stamp household is $640.   41 percent of participants are white; 36 percent are African-American, non-Hispanic; 18 percent are Hispanic; 3 percent are Asian, 2 percent are Native American, and 1 percent are of unknown race or ethnicity.     An annual report released by the  USDA  about the composition of households participating in the Food Stamp Program is identified as the Characteristics Report.     [ edit ]   Critics of the program     [ edit ]   Housing expenditure   The lack of  affordable housing  in urban areas means that money that would have been spent on food is spent on housing expenses. Housing is generally considered affordable when it costs 30% or less of total household income; rising housing costs have made this ideal difficult to attain.   This is especially true in  New York City , where a recent survey shows that more than 28% of city renters are spending more than half their income on rent. Amongst lower income families the percentage is much higher. According to an estimate by the  Community Service Society , 65% of New York City families living below the federal poverty line are paying more than half of their income toward rent.   The current eligibility criteria attempt to address this, by including a deduction for ""excess shelter costs."" This applies only to households that spend more than half of their  net income  on rent. For the purpose of this calculation, a household's net income is obtained by subtracting certain deductions from their gross (before deductions) income. If the household's total expenditures on rent exceed 50% of that net income, then the net income is further reduced by the amount of rent that exceeds 50% of net income. For 2007, this deduction can be no more than $417, except in households that include an elderly or disabled person. [ 5 ]   The adjusted net income, including the deduction for excess shelter costs, is used to determine whether a household is eligible for food stamps.     [ edit ]   Income maintenance   The purpose of the Food Stamp Program as laid out in its implementation was to assist low-income households in obtaining adequate and nutritious diets. According to Rossi, the program rests on the assumption that households with restricted incomes may skimp on food purchases and live on diets that are inadequate in quantity and quality, or, alternatively skimp on other necessities to maintain an adequate diet. [ 6 ]  Food stamps, as many like Rossi, MacDonald and Eisinger contend, are used not only for increasing food but also as income maintenance. Income Maintenance basically is the money that household would have spent on food that they no longer have to; since households no longer have to spend this money on food, they can spend it on other things. The FSP is meant solely to increase food purchases, not to act as a tool of income maintenance.   According to various studies shown by Rossi, because of income maintenance only about $0.17-$0.47 more is being spent on food for every food stamp dollar than was spent prior to individuals receiving food stamps [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Nutritional improvement   Another benefit sometimes attributed to the Food Stamp Program is that it makes nutritious food more readily available.   According to the National Food Consumption Survey individuals in food stamp households do not differ significantly from those living in non-recipient households in the nutritional quality of the food eaten. As a result, Rossi argues that this objective is not being met. [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Proponents of the Program     [ edit ]   Work support   The Food Stamps Program is known in public policy circles as a work support, meaning it is used primarily by people looking for a job, or employed but not making enough to make ends meet. Because food stamps allow this latter group to maintain their low-wage employment, most experts believe food stamps actually keep people off the welfare rolls. Peer-reviewed research on the ""dependency"" effect referenced above is non-existent. The available evidence, in particular a  University of Maryland  study conducted in 2002, indicates that enrollment in the food stamps program keeps former welfare recipients from sliding back into poverty and re-enrolling in welfare programs. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Fraud and abuse   Claims of fraud and abuse of the program have likewise proved to be unfounded. In 2005, 98% of food stamp benefits went to eligible households. According to the  Government Accountability Office , at last count (2004), only 4.48% of food stamps benefits were found to be overpaid, down by more than a third from six years earlier. [ citation needed ]  Two-thirds of all improper payments were found to be the fault of the caseworker, not the individual. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Healthful foods   Finally, while the evidence is mixed as to the effect of the food stamps program on weight gain, studies conducted by the USDA [ citation needed ]  on the receipts of food stamps purchases have found that program participants are more likely to spend their income on fruits, vegetables and healthful foods than low-income consumers who do not participate in the program.

clueweb09-enwp00-68-18733	"                     Food Stamp Program          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search          The US  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program [ 1 ] , historically and commonly known as the  Food Stamp Program , is a  federal assistance  program that provides food to low and no income people living in the  United States . Benefits are distributed by the individual states, but the program is administered through the  U.S. Department of Agriculture . Most food stamp benefits are now distributed using cards but for most of its history the program had actually used paper denominational stamps/coupons worth $1, $5, and $10. These stamps could be used to purchase any prepackaged edible foods regardless of nutritional value (for example  soft drinks  and  confectionery  could be purchased on food stamps). In the late 1990s, the food stamp program was revamped and actual stamps were phased out in favor of a specialized debit card system known as  Electronic Benefit Transfer  (EBT) provided by private contractors. Many states merged the use of the EBT card for public assistance welfare programs as well. The successful replacement over time of all paper food stamps by EBT cards enabled Congress to rename the Food Stamp Program to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, as of October 2008, and update all references in federal law from ""stamp"" or ""coupon"" to ""card"" or ""EBT"". This was effectuated by H.R. 2419, The Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (a/k/a ""2008 Farm Bill"") passed into law as Public Law No: 110-234, over President Bush's veto. [1]   The number of Americans receiving food stamps reached 31.5 million in September 2008 (10.3% of the total USA population), the highest absolute number since the program began in 1962; but the highest ratio was reached in 1994 with 10.5% of the American population. [ 2 ]  Recipients must have near-poverty incomes to qualify for benefits.

Of the program, Perkins said, ""We got a picture of a gorge, with farm surpluses on one cliff and under-nourished city folks with outstretched hands on the other. We set out to find a practical way to build a bridge across that chasm."" The program operated by permitting people on  relief  to buy orange stamps equal to their normal food expenditures; for every $1 worth of orange stamps purchased, 50 cents worth of blue stamps were received. Orange stamps could be used to buy any food; blue stamps could be used only to buy food determined by the Department to be surplus. Over the course of nearly 4 years, the first FSP reached approximately 20 million people at one time or another in nearly half of the counties in the U.S. at a total cost of $262 million. At its peak, the program assisted 4 million people simultaneously. The first recipient was Mabel McFiggin of  Rochester, New York ; the first retailer to redeem the stamps was Joseph Mutolo; and the first retailer caught violating program rules was Nick Salzano in October 1939. The program ended when the conditions that brought the program into being (unmarketable food surpluses and widespread unemployment) no longer existed.     [ edit ]   Pilot Food Stamp Program - May 29, 1961-1964   The 18 years between the end of the first FSP,DSP,and the inception of the next were filled with studies, reports, and legislative proposals. Prominent Senators actively associated with attempts to enact a food stamp program during this period are  Aiken , La Follette,  Humphrey ,  Kefauver , and  Symington . From 1954 on, Congresswoman  Leonor Sullivan  strove unceasingly to pass food stamp program legislation. On  September 21 ,  1959 , P.L. 86-341 authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to operate a food stamp system through  January 31 ,  1962 . The  Eisenhower  Administration never used the authority. However, in fulfillment of a campaign promise made in  West Virginia , President  Kennedy 's first Executive Order called for expanded food distribution and, on  February 2 ,  1961 , he announced that food stamp pilot programs would be initiated. The pilot programs would retain the requirement that the food stamps be purchased, but eliminated the concept of special stamps for surplus foods. A Department spokesman indicated the emphasis would be on increasing the consumption of perishables.   Mr. and Mrs. Alderson Muncy of Paynesville, West Virginia, were the first food stamp recipients on  May 29 ,  1961 . They purchased US$95 in food stamps for their 15-person household. In the first food stamp transaction, they bought a can of  pork and beans  at Henderson's Supermarket. By January 1964, the pilot programs had expanded from eight areas to 43 (40 counties,  Detroit ,  St. Louis , and  Pittsburgh ) in 22 States with 380,000 participants.   Of the program, Congresswoman Leonor K. Sullivan asserted, ""...the Department of Agriculture seemed bent on outlining a possible food stamp plan of such scope and magnitude, involving some 25 million persons, as to make the whole idea seem ridiculous and tear food stamp plans to smithereens."" [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Food Stamp Act of 1964 - August 31, 1964   On  January 31 ,  1964 , President  Johnson  requested Congress to pass legislation making the FSP permanent. Agriculture Secretary  Orville Freeman  submitted proposed legislation to establish a permanent FSP on  April 17 ,  1964 . The bill eventually passed by  Congress  was H.R. 10222, introduced by Congresswoman Sullivan. One of the members on the House Committee on Agriculture who voted against the FSP in Committee was then Representative  Bob Dole . As a Senator, Mr. Dole became a staunch supporter of the Program. Among the official purposes of the Food Stamp Act of 1964 were strengthening the agricultural economy and providing improved levels of nutrition among low-income households; however, the practical purpose was to bring the pilot FSP under Congressional control and to enact the regulations into law. The major provisions were:     The State Plan of Operation requirement and development of eligibility standards by States;   They required that the recipients should purchase their food stamps, while paying the average money spent on food then receiving an amount of food stamps representing an opportunity more nearly to obtain a low-cost nutritionally adequate diet;   The eligibility for purchase with food stamps of all items intended for human consumption except alcoholic beverages and imported foods (the House version would have prohibited the purchase of soft drinks, luxury foods, and luxury frozen foods);   Prohibitions against discrimination on bases of race, religious creed, national origin, or political beliefs;   The division of responsibilities between States (certification and issuance) and the Federal Government (funding of benefits and authorization of retailers and wholesalers), with shared responsibility for funding costs of administration; and   Appropriations for the first year limited to $75 million; for the second year, to $100 million; and, for the third year, to $200 million.     The Agriculture Department estimated that participation in a national FSP would eventually reach 4 million, at a cost of $360 million annually.     [ edit ]   Program Expansion - FSP Participation Milestones in the 1960s and Early 1970s.   In April 1965, participation topped half a million. (Actual participation was 561,261 people.) Participation topped 1 million in March 1966, 2 million in October 1967, 3 million in February 1969, 4 million in February 1970, 5 million one month later in March 1970, 6 million two months later in May 1970, 10 million in February 1971, and 15 million in October 1974. Rapid increases in participation during this period were primarily due to geographic expansion.     [ edit ]   Major Legislative Changes - Early 1970s   The early 1970s were a period of growth in participation, concern about the cost of providing food stamp benefits, and questions about administration, primarily timely certification. It was during this time that the issue was framed that would dominate food stamp legislation ever after: How to balance program access with program accountability? Three major pieces of legislation shaped this period leading up to massive reform to follow:   P.L. 91-671 ( January 11 ,  1971 ) established uniform national standards of eligibility and work requirements; required that allotments be equivalent to the cost of a nutritionally adequate diet; limited households' purchase requirements to 30 percent of their income; instituted an outreach requirement; authorized the Agriculture Department to pay 62.5 percent of specific administrative costs incurred by States; expanded the FSP to  Guam ,  Puerto Rico , and the  Virgin Islands  of the United States; and provided $1.75 billion appropriations for Fiscal Year 1971.   Agriculture and Consumer Protection Act of 1973 (P.L. 93-86,  August 10 ,  1973 ) required States to expand the program to every political jurisdiction before  July 1 ,  1974 ; expanded the program to drug addicts and alcoholics in treatment and rehabilitation centers; established semi-annual allotment adjustments, SSI cash-out, and bi-monthly issuance; introduced statutory complexity in the income definition (by including in-kind payments and providing an accompanying exception); and required the Department to establish temporary eligibility standards for disasters.   P.L. 93-347 ( July 12 ,  1974 ) authorized the Department to pay 50 percent of all States' costs for administering the program and established the requirement for efficient and effective administration by the States.     [ edit ]   1974 Nationwide Program   In accordance with P.L. 93-86, the FSP began operating Nationwide on  July 1 ,  1974 . (The program not fully implemented in Puerto Rico until  November 1 ,  1974 .) Participation for July 1974 was almost 1.4 million.     [ edit ]   The Food Stamp Act of 1977   Both the outgoing Republican Administration and the new Democratic Administration offered Congress proposed legislation to reform the FSP in 1977. The Republican bill stressed targeting benefits to the neediest, simplifying administration, and tightening controls on the program; the Democratic bill focused on increasing access to those most in need and simplifying and streamlining a complicated and cumbersome process that delayed benefit delivery as well as reducing errors, and curbing abuse. The chief force for the Democratic Administration was Robert Greenstein, Administrator of FNS; in Congress, major players were Senators  McGovern ,  Javits , Humphrey, and Dole and Congressmen Foley and Richmond. Amidst all the themes, the one that became the rallying cry for FSP reform was ""EPR"" -- eliminate the purchase requirement -- because of the barrier to participation the purchase requirement represented. The bill that became the law (S. 275) did eliminate the purchase requirement. It also:     eliminated categorical eligibility;   established statutory income eligibility guidelines at the poverty line;   established 10 categories of excluded income;   reduced the number of deductions used to calculate net income and established a standard deduction to take the place of eliminated deductions;   raised the general resource limit to $1,750;   established the fair market value (FMV) test for evaluating vehicles as resources;   penalized households whose heads voluntarily quit jobs;   restricted eligibility for students and aliens;   eliminated the requirement that households must have cooking facilities;   replaced store due bills with cash change up to 99 cents;   established the principle that stores must sell a substantial amount of staple foods if they are to be authorized;   established the ground rules for Indian Tribal Organization administration of the FSP on reservations; and   introduced demonstration project authority.     In addition to EPR, the Food Stamp Act of 1977 included several access provisions:     using mail, telephone, or home visits for certification;   requirements for outreach, bilingual personnel and materials, and nutrition education materials;   recipients' right to submit applications the first day they attempt to do so;   30-day processing standard and inception of the concept of expedited service;   SSI joint processing and coordination with AFDC;   notice, recertification, and retroactive benefit protections; and   a requirement for States to develop a disaster plan.     The integrity provisions of the new program included fraud disqualifications, enhanced Federal funding for States' anti-fraud activities, and financial incentives for low error rates.   The House Report for the 1977 legislation points out that the changes in the Food Stamp Program are needed without reference to upcoming welfare reform since ""the path to welfare reform is, indeed, rocky....""   EPR was implemented  January 1 ,  1979 . Participation that month increased 1.5 million over the preceding month.     [ edit ]   Cutbacks of the Early 1980s   The large and expensive FSP proved to be a favorite subject of close scrutiny from both the Executive Branch and Congress in the early 1980s. Major legislation in 1981 and 1982 enacted cutbacks including:     addition of a gross income eligibility test in addition to the net income test for most households;   temporary freeze on adjustments of the shelter deduction cap and the standard deduction and constraints on future adjustments;   annual adjustments in food stamp allotments rather than semi-annual;   consideration of non-elderly parents who live with their children and non-elderly siblings who live together as one household;   required periodic reporting and retrospective budgeting;   prohibition against using Federal funds for outreach;   replacing the FSP in Puerto Rico with a block grant for nutrition assistance;   counting retirement accounts as resources;   State option to require job search of applicants as well as participants; and   increased disqualification periods for voluntary quitters.     Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) began in  Reading ,  Pennsylvania , in 1984.     [ edit ]   The Mid- to Late 1980s   Recognition of the severe domestic hunger problem in the latter half of the 1980s led to incremental expansions of the FSP in 1985 and 1987, such as elimination of sales tax on food stamp purchases, reinstitution of categorical eligibility, increased resource limit for most households ($2,000), eligibility for the homeless, and expanded nutrition education. The Hunger Prevention Act of 1988 and the Mickey Leland Memorial Domestic Hunger Relief Act in 1990 foretold the improvements that would be coming. The 1988 and 1990 legislation accomplished the following:     increasing benefits by applying a multiplication factor to Thrifty Food Plan costs;   making outreach an optional activity for States;   excluding advance earned income tax credits as income;   simplifying procedures for calculating medical deductions;   instituting periodic adjustments of the minimum benefit;   authorizing nutrition education grants;   establishing severe penalties for violations by individuals or participating firms; and   establishing EBT as an issuance alternative.     Throughout this era, significant players were principally various committee chairmen: Congressmen Leland, Hall, Foley, Panetta, and de la Garza and Senator  Leahy .     [ edit ]   1993 Mickey Leland Childhood Hunger Relief Act   By 1993, major changes in food stamp benefits had arrived. The final legislation provided for $2.8 billion in benefit increases over Fiscal Years 1984-1988. Leon Panetta, in his new role as OMB Director, played a major role as did Senator Leahy. Substantive changes included:     eliminating the shelter deduction cap beginning  January 1 ,  1997 ;   providing a deduction for legally binding child support payments made to nonhousehold members;   raising the cap on the dependent care deduction from $160 to $200 for children under 2 years old and $175 for all other dependents;   improving employment and training (E&T) dependent care reimbursements;   increasing the FMV test for vehicles to $4,550 on  September 1 ,  1994  and $4,600 on  October 1 ,  1995 , then annually adjusting the value from $5,000 on  October 1 ,  1996 ;   mandating asset accumulation demonstration projects; and   simplifying the household definition.       [ edit ]   Later Participation Milestones   In December 1979, participation finally surpassed 20 million. In March 1994, participation hit a new high of 28 million.     [ edit ]   The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunities Reconciliation Act of 1996   The mid-1990s was a period of welfare reform. Many states had waivers of the rules for the cash welfare program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) before major welfare reform legislation was enacted in 1996. The  Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act  of 1996 (PRWORA) removed the entitlement of recipients to AFDC and replaced that with a new block grant to states called  Temporary Assistance to Needy Families  (TANF).   Although the Food Stamp Program was reauthorized in the 1996 Farm Bill, major changes to the program were enacted through PRWORA. Among them were:     eliminating eligibility of most legal immigrants to food stamps;   placing a time limit on food stamp receipt of three out of 36 months for able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs) who are not working at least 20 hours a week or participating in a work program;   reduction in maximum allotments by setting them at 100 percent of the change in the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) from 103 percent of the change in the TFP;   freezing the standard deduction, the vehicle limit, and the minimum benefit;   setting the shelter cap at graduated specified levels up to $300 by fiscal year 2001, and permitting States to make use of the standard utility allowance mandatory;   revising provisions for disqualification, including comparable disqualification with other means-tested programs; and   requiring States to implement EBT before  October 1 ,  2002 .     The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) and the Agricultural Research, Education and Extension Act of 1998 (AREERA) made some changes to these provisions, most significantly:     additional Employment and Training (E&T) funds targeted toward providing work program opportunities for ABAWDs;   allowing States to exempt up to 15 percent of the estimated number of ABAWDs who would otherwise be ineligible;   restoring eligibility for certain elderly, disabled and child immigrants who resided in the United States when PRWORA was enacted; and   cutting administrative funding for States to account for certain administrative costs that previously had been allocated to the AFDC program and now were required to be allocated to the Food Stamp Program.     The fiscal year 2001 agriculture appropriations bill included two significant changes to the Food Stamp Program. The legislation increased the excess shelter cap to $340 in fiscal year 2001 and then indexed the cap to changes in the Consumer Price Index for All Consumers each year beginning in fiscal year 2002. The legislation also allowed States to use the vehicle limit they use in a TANF assistance program, if it would be result in a lower attribution of resources for the household.     [ edit ]   The Farm Bill of 2002   Participation declined throughout the late 1990s, even more so than expected based on the changes in PRWORA and falling unemployment. Program access and simplification of program rules were a major focus of proposed legislation and of major regulations promulgated by the Department. In May 2002, the Food Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 was enacted, including reauthorization of the Food Stamp Program. Major changes to food stamps included:     restoration of eligibility for food stamps to qualified aliens who have been in the United States at least five years;   restoration of eligibility for immigrants receiving certain disability payments and for children, regardless of how long they have been the country;   adjusting the standard deduction to vary by household size and indexed each year for inflation;   reforming the quality control (QC) system by basing financial sanctions on consecutive years of high error rate;   replacing enhanced funding for States with low error rates with a performance bonus system based on several different measures of performance;   providing States with several options to simplify the program, including aligning the definition of income and/or resources to that used in TANF or  Medicaid , adopting a simplified reporting system, and providing transitional benefits for clients leaving TANF;   cutting E&T funding while eliminating the requirements of targeting those funds toward ABAWDs; and   eliminating the cost neutrality requirement for EBT systems.     Food stamp participation began to increase in fiscal year 2001 and has continued to rise through the beginning of fiscal year 2003. The Department continues to work with States to implement the various provisions of the Farm Bill, through guidance and regulations.     [ edit ]   Statistics   According to the  United States Department of Agriculture , statistics for the food stamp program are as follows: [ 4 ]     51 percent of all participants are children (17 or younger), and 65 percent of them live in single-parent households.   55 percent of food stamp households include children.   9 percent of all participants are elderly (age 60 or over).   79 percent of all benefits go to households with children, 14 percent go to households with disabled persons, and 7 percent go to households with elderly persons.   36 percent of households with children were headed by a single parent, the overwhelming majority of whom were women.   The average household size is 2.3 persons.   The average gross monthly income per food stamp household is $640.   41 percent of participants are white; 36 percent are African-American, non-Hispanic; 18 percent are Hispanic; 3 percent are Asian, 2 percent are Native American, and 1 percent are of unknown race or ethnicity.     An annual report released by the  USDA  about the composition of households participating in the Food Stamp Program is identified as the Characteristics Report.     [ edit ]   Critics of the program     [ edit ]   Housing expenditure   The lack of  affordable housing  in urban areas means that money that would have been spent on food is spent on housing expenses. Housing is generally considered affordable when it costs 30% or less of total household income; rising housing costs have made this ideal difficult to attain.   This is especially true in  New York City , where a recent survey shows that more than 28% of city renters are spending more than half their income on rent. Amongst lower income families the percentage is much higher. According to an estimate by the  Community Service Society , 65% of New York City families living below the federal poverty line are paying more than half of their income toward rent.   The current eligibility criteria attempt to address this, by including a deduction for ""excess shelter costs."" This applies only to households that spend more than half of their  net income  on rent. For the purpose of this calculation, a household's net income is obtained by subtracting certain deductions from their gross (before deductions) income. If the household's total expenditures on rent exceed 50% of that net income, then the net income is further reduced by the amount of rent that exceeds 50% of net income. For 2007, this deduction can be no more than $417, except in households that include an elderly or disabled person. [ 5 ]   The adjusted net income, including the deduction for excess shelter costs, is used to determine whether a household is eligible for food stamps.     [ edit ]   Income maintenance   The purpose of the Food Stamp Program as laid out in its implementation was to assist low-income households in obtaining adequate and nutritious diets. According to Rossi, the program rests on the assumption that households with restricted incomes may skimp on food purchases and live on diets that are inadequate in quantity and quality, or, alternatively skimp on other necessities to maintain an adequate diet. [ 6 ]  Food stamps, as many like Rossi, MacDonald and Eisinger contend, are used not only for increasing food but also as income maintenance. Income Maintenance basically is the money that household would have spent on food that they no longer have to; since households no longer have to spend this money on food, they can spend it on other things. The FSP is meant solely to increase food purchases, not to act as a tool of income maintenance.   According to various studies shown by Rossi, because of income maintenance only about $0.17-$0.47 more is being spent on food for every food stamp dollar than was spent prior to individuals receiving food stamps [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Nutritional improvement   Another benefit sometimes attributed to the Food Stamp Program is that it makes nutritious food more readily available.   According to the National Food Consumption Survey individuals in food stamp households do not differ significantly from those living in non-recipient households in the nutritional quality of the food eaten. As a result, Rossi argues that this objective is not being met. [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Proponents of the Program     [ edit ]   Work support   The Food Stamps Program is known in public policy circles as a work support, meaning it is used primarily by people looking for a job, or employed but not making enough to make ends meet. Because food stamps allow this latter group to maintain their low-wage employment, most experts believe food stamps actually keep people off the welfare rolls. Peer-reviewed research on the ""dependency"" effect referenced above is non-existent. The available evidence, in particular a  University of Maryland  study conducted in 2002, indicates that enrollment in the food stamps program keeps former welfare recipients from sliding back into poverty and re-enrolling in welfare programs. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Fraud and abuse   Claims of fraud and abuse of the program have likewise proved to be unfounded. In 2005, 98% of food stamp benefits went to eligible households. According to the  Government Accountability Office , at last count (2004), only 4.48% of food stamps benefits were found to be overpaid, down by more than a third from six years earlier. [ citation needed ]  Two-thirds of all improper payments were found to be the fault of the caseworker, not the individual. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Healthful foods   Finally, while the evidence is mixed as to the effect of the food stamps program on weight gain, studies conducted by the USDA [ citation needed ]  on the receipts of food stamps purchases have found that program participants are more likely to spend their income on fruits, vegetables and healthful foods than low-income consumers who do not participate in the program.

Please  improve this article  or discuss the issue on the  talk page .       The US  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program [ 1 ] , historically and commonly known as the  Food Stamp Program , is a  federal assistance  program that provides food to low and no income people living in the  United States . Benefits are distributed by the individual states, but the program is administered through the  U.S. Department of Agriculture . Most food stamp benefits are now distributed using cards but for most of its history the program had actually used paper denominational stamps/coupons worth $1, $5, and $10. These stamps could be used to purchase any prepackaged edible foods regardless of nutritional value (for example  soft drinks  and  confectionery  could be purchased on food stamps). In the late 1990s, the food stamp program was revamped and actual stamps were phased out in favor of a specialized debit card system known as  Electronic Benefit Transfer  (EBT) provided by private contractors. Many states merged the use of the EBT card for public assistance welfare programs as well. The successful replacement over time of all paper food stamps by EBT cards enabled Congress to rename the Food Stamp Program to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, as of October 2008, and update all references in federal law from ""stamp"" or ""coupon"" to ""card"" or ""EBT"". This was effectuated by H.R. 2419, The Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (a/k/a ""2008 Farm Bill"") passed into law as Public Law No: 110-234, over President Bush's veto. [1]   The number of Americans receiving food stamps reached 31.5 million in September 2008 (10.3% of the total USA population), the highest absolute number since the program began in 1962; but the highest ratio was reached in 1994 with 10.5% of the American population. [ 2 ]  Recipients must have near-poverty incomes to qualify for benefits.

Of the program, Perkins said, ""We got a picture of a gorge, with farm surpluses on one cliff and under-nourished city folks with outstretched hands on the other. We set out to find a practical way to build a bridge across that chasm."" The program operated by permitting people on  relief  to buy orange stamps equal to their normal food expenditures; for every $1 worth of orange stamps purchased, 50 cents worth of blue stamps were received. Orange stamps could be used to buy any food; blue stamps could be used only to buy food determined by the Department to be surplus. Over the course of nearly 4 years, the first FSP reached approximately 20 million people at one time or another in nearly half of the counties in the U.S. at a total cost of $262 million. At its peak, the program assisted 4 million people simultaneously. The first recipient was Mabel McFiggin of  Rochester, New York ; the first retailer to redeem the stamps was Joseph Mutolo; and the first retailer caught violating program rules was Nick Salzano in October 1939. The program ended when the conditions that brought the program into being (unmarketable food surpluses and widespread unemployment) no longer existed.     [ edit ]   Pilot Food Stamp Program - May 29, 1961-1964   The 18 years between the end of the first FSP,DSP,and the inception of the next were filled with studies, reports, and legislative proposals. Prominent Senators actively associated with attempts to enact a food stamp program during this period are  Aiken , La Follette,  Humphrey ,  Kefauver , and  Symington . From 1954 on, Congresswoman  Leonor Sullivan  strove unceasingly to pass food stamp program legislation. On  September 21 ,  1959 , P.L. 86-341 authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to operate a food stamp system through  January 31 ,  1962 . The  Eisenhower  Administration never used the authority. However, in fulfillment of a campaign promise made in  West Virginia , President  Kennedy 's first Executive Order called for expanded food distribution and, on  February 2 ,  1961 , he announced that food stamp pilot programs would be initiated. The pilot programs would retain the requirement that the food stamps be purchased, but eliminated the concept of special stamps for surplus foods. A Department spokesman indicated the emphasis would be on increasing the consumption of perishables.   Mr. and Mrs. Alderson Muncy of Paynesville, West Virginia, were the first food stamp recipients on  May 29 ,  1961 . They purchased US$95 in food stamps for their 15-person household. In the first food stamp transaction, they bought a can of  pork and beans  at Henderson's Supermarket. By January 1964, the pilot programs had expanded from eight areas to 43 (40 counties,  Detroit ,  St. Louis , and  Pittsburgh ) in 22 States with 380,000 participants.   Of the program, Congresswoman Leonor K. Sullivan asserted, ""...the Department of Agriculture seemed bent on outlining a possible food stamp plan of such scope and magnitude, involving some 25 million persons, as to make the whole idea seem ridiculous and tear food stamp plans to smithereens."" [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Food Stamp Act of 1964 - August 31, 1964   On  January 31 ,  1964 , President  Johnson  requested Congress to pass legislation making the FSP permanent. Agriculture Secretary  Orville Freeman  submitted proposed legislation to establish a permanent FSP on  April 17 ,  1964 . The bill eventually passed by  Congress  was H.R. 10222, introduced by Congresswoman Sullivan. One of the members on the House Committee on Agriculture who voted against the FSP in Committee was then Representative  Bob Dole . As a Senator, Mr. Dole became a staunch supporter of the Program. Among the official purposes of the Food Stamp Act of 1964 were strengthening the agricultural economy and providing improved levels of nutrition among low-income households; however, the practical purpose was to bring the pilot FSP under Congressional control and to enact the regulations into law. The major provisions were:     The State Plan of Operation requirement and development of eligibility standards by States;   They required that the recipients should purchase their food stamps, while paying the average money spent on food then receiving an amount of food stamps representing an opportunity more nearly to obtain a low-cost nutritionally adequate diet;   The eligibility for purchase with food stamps of all items intended for human consumption except alcoholic beverages and imported foods (the House version would have prohibited the purchase of soft drinks, luxury foods, and luxury frozen foods);   Prohibitions against discrimination on bases of race, religious creed, national origin, or political beliefs;   The division of responsibilities between States (certification and issuance) and the Federal Government (funding of benefits and authorization of retailers and wholesalers), with shared responsibility for funding costs of administration; and   Appropriations for the first year limited to $75 million; for the second year, to $100 million; and, for the third year, to $200 million.     The Agriculture Department estimated that participation in a national FSP would eventually reach 4 million, at a cost of $360 million annually.     [ edit ]   Program Expansion - FSP Participation Milestones in the 1960s and Early 1970s.   In April 1965, participation topped half a million. (Actual participation was 561,261 people.) Participation topped 1 million in March 1966, 2 million in October 1967, 3 million in February 1969, 4 million in February 1970, 5 million one month later in March 1970, 6 million two months later in May 1970, 10 million in February 1971, and 15 million in October 1974. Rapid increases in participation during this period were primarily due to geographic expansion.     [ edit ]   Major Legislative Changes - Early 1970s   The early 1970s were a period of growth in participation, concern about the cost of providing food stamp benefits, and questions about administration, primarily timely certification. It was during this time that the issue was framed that would dominate food stamp legislation ever after: How to balance program access with program accountability? Three major pieces of legislation shaped this period leading up to massive reform to follow:   P.L. 91-671 ( January 11 ,  1971 ) established uniform national standards of eligibility and work requirements; required that allotments be equivalent to the cost of a nutritionally adequate diet; limited households' purchase requirements to 30 percent of their income; instituted an outreach requirement; authorized the Agriculture Department to pay 62.5 percent of specific administrative costs incurred by States; expanded the FSP to  Guam ,  Puerto Rico , and the  Virgin Islands  of the United States; and provided $1.75 billion appropriations for Fiscal Year 1971.   Agriculture and Consumer Protection Act of 1973 (P.L. 93-86,  August 10 ,  1973 ) required States to expand the program to every political jurisdiction before  July 1 ,  1974 ; expanded the program to drug addicts and alcoholics in treatment and rehabilitation centers; established semi-annual allotment adjustments, SSI cash-out, and bi-monthly issuance; introduced statutory complexity in the income definition (by including in-kind payments and providing an accompanying exception); and required the Department to establish temporary eligibility standards for disasters.   P.L. 93-347 ( July 12 ,  1974 ) authorized the Department to pay 50 percent of all States' costs for administering the program and established the requirement for efficient and effective administration by the States.     [ edit ]   1974 Nationwide Program   In accordance with P.L. 93-86, the FSP began operating Nationwide on  July 1 ,  1974 . (The program not fully implemented in Puerto Rico until  November 1 ,  1974 .) Participation for July 1974 was almost 1.4 million.     [ edit ]   The Food Stamp Act of 1977   Both the outgoing Republican Administration and the new Democratic Administration offered Congress proposed legislation to reform the FSP in 1977. The Republican bill stressed targeting benefits to the neediest, simplifying administration, and tightening controls on the program; the Democratic bill focused on increasing access to those most in need and simplifying and streamlining a complicated and cumbersome process that delayed benefit delivery as well as reducing errors, and curbing abuse. The chief force for the Democratic Administration was Robert Greenstein, Administrator of FNS; in Congress, major players were Senators  McGovern ,  Javits , Humphrey, and Dole and Congressmen Foley and Richmond. Amidst all the themes, the one that became the rallying cry for FSP reform was ""EPR"" -- eliminate the purchase requirement -- because of the barrier to participation the purchase requirement represented. The bill that became the law (S. 275) did eliminate the purchase requirement. It also:     eliminated categorical eligibility;   established statutory income eligibility guidelines at the poverty line;   established 10 categories of excluded income;   reduced the number of deductions used to calculate net income and established a standard deduction to take the place of eliminated deductions;   raised the general resource limit to $1,750;   established the fair market value (FMV) test for evaluating vehicles as resources;   penalized households whose heads voluntarily quit jobs;   restricted eligibility for students and aliens;   eliminated the requirement that households must have cooking facilities;   replaced store due bills with cash change up to 99 cents;   established the principle that stores must sell a substantial amount of staple foods if they are to be authorized;   established the ground rules for Indian Tribal Organization administration of the FSP on reservations; and   introduced demonstration project authority.     In addition to EPR, the Food Stamp Act of 1977 included several access provisions:     using mail, telephone, or home visits for certification;   requirements for outreach, bilingual personnel and materials, and nutrition education materials;   recipients' right to submit applications the first day they attempt to do so;   30-day processing standard and inception of the concept of expedited service;   SSI joint processing and coordination with AFDC;   notice, recertification, and retroactive benefit protections; and   a requirement for States to develop a disaster plan.     The integrity provisions of the new program included fraud disqualifications, enhanced Federal funding for States' anti-fraud activities, and financial incentives for low error rates.   The House Report for the 1977 legislation points out that the changes in the Food Stamp Program are needed without reference to upcoming welfare reform since ""the path to welfare reform is, indeed, rocky....""   EPR was implemented  January 1 ,  1979 . Participation that month increased 1.5 million over the preceding month.     [ edit ]   Cutbacks of the Early 1980s   The large and expensive FSP proved to be a favorite subject of close scrutiny from both the Executive Branch and Congress in the early 1980s. Major legislation in 1981 and 1982 enacted cutbacks including:     addition of a gross income eligibility test in addition to the net income test for most households;   temporary freeze on adjustments of the shelter deduction cap and the standard deduction and constraints on future adjustments;   annual adjustments in food stamp allotments rather than semi-annual;   consideration of non-elderly parents who live with their children and non-elderly siblings who live together as one household;   required periodic reporting and retrospective budgeting;   prohibition against using Federal funds for outreach;   replacing the FSP in Puerto Rico with a block grant for nutrition assistance;   counting retirement accounts as resources;   State option to require job search of applicants as well as participants; and   increased disqualification periods for voluntary quitters.     Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) began in  Reading ,  Pennsylvania , in 1984.     [ edit ]   The Mid- to Late 1980s   Recognition of the severe domestic hunger problem in the latter half of the 1980s led to incremental expansions of the FSP in 1985 and 1987, such as elimination of sales tax on food stamp purchases, reinstitution of categorical eligibility, increased resource limit for most households ($2,000), eligibility for the homeless, and expanded nutrition education. The Hunger Prevention Act of 1988 and the Mickey Leland Memorial Domestic Hunger Relief Act in 1990 foretold the improvements that would be coming. The 1988 and 1990 legislation accomplished the following:     increasing benefits by applying a multiplication factor to Thrifty Food Plan costs;   making outreach an optional activity for States;   excluding advance earned income tax credits as income;   simplifying procedures for calculating medical deductions;   instituting periodic adjustments of the minimum benefit;   authorizing nutrition education grants;   establishing severe penalties for violations by individuals or participating firms; and   establishing EBT as an issuance alternative.     Throughout this era, significant players were principally various committee chairmen: Congressmen Leland, Hall, Foley, Panetta, and de la Garza and Senator  Leahy .     [ edit ]   1993 Mickey Leland Childhood Hunger Relief Act   By 1993, major changes in food stamp benefits had arrived. The final legislation provided for $2.8 billion in benefit increases over Fiscal Years 1984-1988. Leon Panetta, in his new role as OMB Director, played a major role as did Senator Leahy. Substantive changes included:     eliminating the shelter deduction cap beginning  January 1 ,  1997 ;   providing a deduction for legally binding child support payments made to nonhousehold members;   raising the cap on the dependent care deduction from $160 to $200 for children under 2 years old and $175 for all other dependents;   improving employment and training (E&T) dependent care reimbursements;   increasing the FMV test for vehicles to $4,550 on  September 1 ,  1994  and $4,600 on  October 1 ,  1995 , then annually adjusting the value from $5,000 on  October 1 ,  1996 ;   mandating asset accumulation demonstration projects; and   simplifying the household definition.       [ edit ]   Later Participation Milestones   In December 1979, participation finally surpassed 20 million. In March 1994, participation hit a new high of 28 million.     [ edit ]   The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunities Reconciliation Act of 1996   The mid-1990s was a period of welfare reform. Many states had waivers of the rules for the cash welfare program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) before major welfare reform legislation was enacted in 1996. The  Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act  of 1996 (PRWORA) removed the entitlement of recipients to AFDC and replaced that with a new block grant to states called  Temporary Assistance to Needy Families  (TANF).   Although the Food Stamp Program was reauthorized in the 1996 Farm Bill, major changes to the program were enacted through PRWORA. Among them were:     eliminating eligibility of most legal immigrants to food stamps;   placing a time limit on food stamp receipt of three out of 36 months for able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs) who are not working at least 20 hours a week or participating in a work program;   reduction in maximum allotments by setting them at 100 percent of the change in the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) from 103 percent of the change in the TFP;   freezing the standard deduction, the vehicle limit, and the minimum benefit;   setting the shelter cap at graduated specified levels up to $300 by fiscal year 2001, and permitting States to make use of the standard utility allowance mandatory;   revising provisions for disqualification, including comparable disqualification with other means-tested programs; and   requiring States to implement EBT before  October 1 ,  2002 .     The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) and the Agricultural Research, Education and Extension Act of 1998 (AREERA) made some changes to these provisions, most significantly:     additional Employment and Training (E&T) funds targeted toward providing work program opportunities for ABAWDs;   allowing States to exempt up to 15 percent of the estimated number of ABAWDs who would otherwise be ineligible;   restoring eligibility for certain elderly, disabled and child immigrants who resided in the United States when PRWORA was enacted; and   cutting administrative funding for States to account for certain administrative costs that previously had been allocated to the AFDC program and now were required to be allocated to the Food Stamp Program.     The fiscal year 2001 agriculture appropriations bill included two significant changes to the Food Stamp Program. The legislation increased the excess shelter cap to $340 in fiscal year 2001 and then indexed the cap to changes in the Consumer Price Index for All Consumers each year beginning in fiscal year 2002. The legislation also allowed States to use the vehicle limit they use in a TANF assistance program, if it would be result in a lower attribution of resources for the household.     [ edit ]   The Farm Bill of 2002   Participation declined throughout the late 1990s, even more so than expected based on the changes in PRWORA and falling unemployment. Program access and simplification of program rules were a major focus of proposed legislation and of major regulations promulgated by the Department. In May 2002, the Food Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 was enacted, including reauthorization of the Food Stamp Program. Major changes to food stamps included:     restoration of eligibility for food stamps to qualified aliens who have been in the United States at least five years;   restoration of eligibility for immigrants receiving certain disability payments and for children, regardless of how long they have been the country;   adjusting the standard deduction to vary by household size and indexed each year for inflation;   reforming the quality control (QC) system by basing financial sanctions on consecutive years of high error rate;   replacing enhanced funding for States with low error rates with a performance bonus system based on several different measures of performance;   providing States with several options to simplify the program, including aligning the definition of income and/or resources to that used in TANF or  Medicaid , adopting a simplified reporting system, and providing transitional benefits for clients leaving TANF;   cutting E&T funding while eliminating the requirements of targeting those funds toward ABAWDs; and   eliminating the cost neutrality requirement for EBT systems.     Food stamp participation began to increase in fiscal year 2001 and has continued to rise through the beginning of fiscal year 2003. The Department continues to work with States to implement the various provisions of the Farm Bill, through guidance and regulations.     [ edit ]   Statistics   According to the  United States Department of Agriculture , statistics for the food stamp program are as follows: [ 4 ]     51 percent of all participants are children (17 or younger), and 65 percent of them live in single-parent households.   55 percent of food stamp households include children.   9 percent of all participants are elderly (age 60 or over).   79 percent of all benefits go to households with children, 14 percent go to households with disabled persons, and 7 percent go to households with elderly persons.   36 percent of households with children were headed by a single parent, the overwhelming majority of whom were women.   The average household size is 2.3 persons.   The average gross monthly income per food stamp household is $640.   41 percent of participants are white; 36 percent are African-American, non-Hispanic; 18 percent are Hispanic; 3 percent are Asian, 2 percent are Native American, and 1 percent are of unknown race or ethnicity.     An annual report released by the  USDA  about the composition of households participating in the Food Stamp Program is identified as the Characteristics Report.     [ edit ]   Critics of the program     [ edit ]   Housing expenditure   The lack of  affordable housing  in urban areas means that money that would have been spent on food is spent on housing expenses. Housing is generally considered affordable when it costs 30% or less of total household income; rising housing costs have made this ideal difficult to attain.   This is especially true in  New York City , where a recent survey shows that more than 28% of city renters are spending more than half their income on rent. Amongst lower income families the percentage is much higher. According to an estimate by the  Community Service Society , 65% of New York City families living below the federal poverty line are paying more than half of their income toward rent.   The current eligibility criteria attempt to address this, by including a deduction for ""excess shelter costs."" This applies only to households that spend more than half of their  net income  on rent. For the purpose of this calculation, a household's net income is obtained by subtracting certain deductions from their gross (before deductions) income. If the household's total expenditures on rent exceed 50% of that net income, then the net income is further reduced by the amount of rent that exceeds 50% of net income. For 2007, this deduction can be no more than $417, except in households that include an elderly or disabled person. [ 5 ]   The adjusted net income, including the deduction for excess shelter costs, is used to determine whether a household is eligible for food stamps.     [ edit ]   Income maintenance   The purpose of the Food Stamp Program as laid out in its implementation was to assist low-income households in obtaining adequate and nutritious diets. According to Rossi, the program rests on the assumption that households with restricted incomes may skimp on food purchases and live on diets that are inadequate in quantity and quality, or, alternatively skimp on other necessities to maintain an adequate diet. [ 6 ]  Food stamps, as many like Rossi, MacDonald and Eisinger contend, are used not only for increasing food but also as income maintenance. Income Maintenance basically is the money that household would have spent on food that they no longer have to; since households no longer have to spend this money on food, they can spend it on other things. The FSP is meant solely to increase food purchases, not to act as a tool of income maintenance.   According to various studies shown by Rossi, because of income maintenance only about $0.17-$0.47 more is being spent on food for every food stamp dollar than was spent prior to individuals receiving food stamps [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Nutritional improvement   Another benefit sometimes attributed to the Food Stamp Program is that it makes nutritious food more readily available.   According to the National Food Consumption Survey individuals in food stamp households do not differ significantly from those living in non-recipient households in the nutritional quality of the food eaten. As a result, Rossi argues that this objective is not being met. [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Proponents of the Program     [ edit ]   Work support   The Food Stamps Program is known in public policy circles as a work support, meaning it is used primarily by people looking for a job, or employed but not making enough to make ends meet. Because food stamps allow this latter group to maintain their low-wage employment, most experts believe food stamps actually keep people off the welfare rolls. Peer-reviewed research on the ""dependency"" effect referenced above is non-existent. The available evidence, in particular a  University of Maryland  study conducted in 2002, indicates that enrollment in the food stamps program keeps former welfare recipients from sliding back into poverty and re-enrolling in welfare programs. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Fraud and abuse   Claims of fraud and abuse of the program have likewise proved to be unfounded. In 2005, 98% of food stamp benefits went to eligible households. According to the  Government Accountability Office , at last count (2004), only 4.48% of food stamps benefits were found to be overpaid, down by more than a third from six years earlier. [ citation needed ]  Two-thirds of all improper payments were found to be the fault of the caseworker, not the individual. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Healthful foods   Finally, while the evidence is mixed as to the effect of the food stamps program on weight gain, studies conducted by the USDA [ citation needed ]  on the receipts of food stamps purchases have found that program participants are more likely to spend their income on fruits, vegetables and healthful foods than low-income consumers who do not participate in the program.

Related Links and Other Helping Agencies for            Food Assistance                   Program Overview          The United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Food Assistance          Program (also known as the Food Stamp Program) provides Food Stamp benefits          low-income households who qualify. It also provides education on food          preparation and nutrition to these families. This program is meant to          provide low income households with access to a healthy, nutritious diet.                  The Food Assistance Program serves as the first line of defense against          hunger. This program provides crucial support to elderly households, needy          working households, and to those households making the transition from          welfare to work. Food stamp recipients can spend their benefits to buy          eligible nutritious food. They can also spend the food stamp benefit for          plants and seeds to grow food for their household to eat.            What are Food Stamps?         The Food Assistance Program (also known as the Food Stamp Program) is          a nutrition assistance program which provides a Vision card (plastic debit          card) to eligible persons for use in purchasing food from local grocery          stores. Complete information regarding food assistance eligibility can          be obtained by contacting your local Social and Rehabilitation Services          Office or call toll free at 1-888-369-4777.            How does the program work?          SRS offers food assistance (food stamps) to low income individuals and          families to buy food from the local grocery store. The cost is electronically          subtracted from the person’s Vision card account. The Vision card          looks and acts like a debit card. Simply present the card to the store          clerk when purchasing food.            Who is eligible?                   Persons who work, but have a low income and those who do not work            are eligible.                     Persons who live together and buy food together are eligible. Household            members do not have to be related to be considered part of the household.                                 Persons age 60 and older and persons with disabilities are eligible.            Persons with disabilities such as those receiving Supplemental Security            Income, Social Security Disability payments, certain Veteran’s            disability payments, disability retirement benefits for a permanent            disability, and railroad disability.                   Any single individual, household, or group of individuals who live and          eat together, whose income and resources are low and who meet certain          basic program requirements can qualify.          THE FOOD STAMP PROGRAM IS AVAILABLE TO ALL ELIGIBLE PERSONS REGARDLESS          OF RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, AGE, NATIONAL ORIGIN, POLITICAL BELIEFS, OR          HANDICAPS.            How much help can I get?          The amount of assistance eligible persons receive is based on household          size and amount of income after deductions.           What are the income requirements?                                The Maximum Monthly Net Incomes                (Effective 10-01-08)                                  $867             1 person                                  $1167             2 persons                                  $1467             3 persons                                  $1767             4 persons                                  $2067               5 persons                                  Add $300 for each additional person                           What other household resources count          toward eligibility?          All income and resources must be reported when you apply. Although certain          types of income may be excluded, most is counted in determining eligibility          and the amount of food assistance benefits for the household. Food assistance          income limits go up as household size increases. The following can be          deducted from total gross monthly income to determine monthly net Income:                           to cover basic household expenses, a standard deduction will be subtracted                     to cover work-related expenses and payroll taxes, a 20% deduction            will be subtracted from earned income           to cover dependent care expenses, a deduction for actual costs, up            to the maximum allowed, will be subtracted           to cover high shelter expenses, a deduction for actual costs, up to            the maximum allowed, may be subtracted           to cover legally obligated child support payments, a deduction for            actual payments will be subtracted                   All households may have up to $2,000 worth of resources. Households          may have up to $3,000 if at least one member is age 60 or older or is          disabled.          Some countable resources that apply toward the $2,000 (or $3,000) limit          are:                   cash, checking and savings accounts            U.S. Savings Bonds            Savings Certificates           buildings or land (except family home)            jointly owned resources                  Certain Resources are exempt, such as:                   the home where you live           cars and other vehicles           life insurance policies            income-producing real estate (if the property annually produces income            consistent with its fair market value)            tradesman tools and farm machinery                  See Special Provisions below for eligibility requirements for the elderly,          disabled, Veterans, households with farm income, and those receiving other          assistance.            Do I have to be a U.S. citizen to apply?          To be eligible for Food Assistance, persons or the persons’ household          members must be United States citizens or meet other non-citizen qualifications.          Many non-citizens may be eligible for assistance, so please apply. SRS          is not required to report to Immigration and Naturalization Services.                   What are the special provisions?           Special Provisions for the Elderly and/or          Disabled           Special Provisions for the elderly and/or disabled include medical expenses          and shelter expenses. Additionally, elderly and disabled people who have          difficulty getting around can ask the SRS office to arrange a home visit          or telephone interview. Elderly and disabled people may also name an authorized          representative who can complete the food assistance application process          for them or can assist or accompany them.         Special Provisions for Medical Expenses                    Medical Expenses are defined as if a household has at least one person          who:                    is 60 or older            receives SSI benefits or disability payments under the Social Security            Act           is a disabled veteran, a disabled surviving spouse of a veteran, or            a disabled surviving child of a veteran           meets one of the other specific disability criteria                   The person may deduct unreimbursed medical expenses that exceed $35          a month for its elderly or disabled members. Deductions are made from          the household's adjusted income.          Special Provisions for Shelter Expenses          Households with elderly or disabled persons may also deduct all shelter          costs over 50% of the household's adjusted income. Disabled persons receiving          or applying for SSI benefits may apply for food assistance at local Social          Security offices at the time they apply or reapply for SSI benefits. Joint          processing is limited to persons who live in households in which all members          are receiving or applying for SSI.         Special Provisions for Households with          Farm Income           If the cost of producing farm income exceeds the income derived from          self-employment as a farmer, such losses will be offset against any other          countable income in the household. To utilize this provision, a self-employed          farmer must receive or anticipate receiving annual gross proceeds of $1,000          or more from the farming enterprise.           Special Provisions for Categorically          Eligible Households         Households in which all members receive or are authorized to receive          Temporary Assistance for Families (TAF), General Assistance (GA) and/or          Supplemental Security Income (SSI) may be considered categorically eligible          for food assistance because of their status as TAF, GA and/or SSI recipients.          If all members of the household are approved for TAF, GA and/or SSI benefits,          contact the local SRS office about the possibility of categorical eligibility          for food stamps.            How does the Nutrition Education          part of the Food Assistance Program work?          Teaching about good nutrition is an important part of the Food Assistance          Program. It is meant to help food stamp participants and others choose          healthy foods and an active lifestyle. It can also help them stretch their          food dollars with easy meals. The State of Kansas works with Kansas State          University Extension Service to provide the Food Stamp Nutrition Education          Program. SRS and Kansas State University Extension Service are part of          the Kansas Nutrition Network (KNN).           How can Nutrition information          help?          USDA studies show that many low-income households do not know the facts          about good dietary practices. Approximately 65% of adults in America and          16% of children and adolescents are overweight. This extra weight is putting          them at risk for serious problems. These include heart disease, hypertension,          diabetes and some cancers.          In Kansas, the objectives of the Food Stamp Nutrition Education (FSNE)          program are to:                   improve dietary quality by providing information on the Dietary Guidelines            and My Pyramid           increase fruit and vegetable consumption           increase food resource management skills            increase participation in physical activity           increase food security by taking advantage of Food Stamp benefits                   How can I get food preparation          and nutrition information?          Newsletters are sent to Food Stamp households. Recipients are also encouraged          to attend food and nutrition classes and workshops. Youth are also taught          nutrition in Head Start and pre-school facilities, school classrooms,          churches, community centers, and in summer school programs.

Kansas          counties responded to a 2005 survey and provided the local food distribution          points in each county.          The          Food Resources Map  and its list of Kansas counties contain links to          a page for each county, with a listing of those county and community agencies          that distribute food to persons in need.

Stamps Caseload Characteristics                                                                                  The 1996 welfare law mandated changes in food nutrition programs, most notably a scaling back of the Food Stamp Program. Following the implementation of PRWORA, participation in the Food Stamp Program declined considerably - approximately 28 percent between December 1995 and December 1998. However, this trend has seen a reverse, with Food Stamps caseloads increasing for 28 of the past 32 months. This increase may be due to a slowed economy as well as growing efforts to connect eligible people with benefits. Four studies in Arizona, Illinois, Iowa, and South Carolina were designed to examine the status of those who leave the Food Stamp Program. The South Carolina project expands upon a welfare leavers study. The projects all pay close attention to able-bodied adults ages 18-50 without dependents, who are now subject to time limits if they do not meet specific work requirements. Researchers are using administrative records and surveys to analyze employment, support from earnings and income, and support from public/private programs. Illinois and Arizona released final reports in early 2001. A final report for South Carolina was released in September 2001. The final report for Iowa was released in July 2002. The Farm Bill that was passed in late 2001 restored Food Stamps benefits to legal immigrants who have been in the country for 5 years, legal immigrant children (regardless of time of entry), and legal immigrants with disabilities.        Selected Summary Findings In Brief    Study of Arizona Adults Leaving the Food Stamp Program  ( Abt  March 2002): Adults with dependents or a disability who did not receive Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) at any time during the 12 months preceding their food stamp exit showed the highest degree of self-sufficiency (independence from both public benefits and private support and higher earnings).  Adults with dependents or a disability who received TANF at some time during the 12 months preceding their exit improved the most in their post-exit employment situation.  Able-bodied adults without dependents and adults with dependents or a disability who received TANF showed the strongest evidence of post-exit hardship and deprivation (living with family or friends while paying no rent or partial rent, no health insurance coverage, and food insecure with moderate or severe hunger).  Food Stamps in Illinois  ( Mathematica  March 2001): Most food stamp leavers report leaving the FSP because of an employment or earnings increase.  Families are more likely than other groups of households to have left because of an employment or earnings increase.  Many food stamp leavers return to the program. Half returned within the next 24 months.  Just about half of all leavers are employed in any given month after FSP exit, and many work in low-wage jobs. Families are more likely than other household types to be employed and to have higher earnings.  Food stamp leavers as a group have fairly low incomes. Approximately two years after they exited the FSP, more than half had incomes below the poverty level.  Family leavers reported more income two years after FSP exit than ABAWDs (Able-bodied adults without dependents) or the elderly/disabled leavers. Similarly, rural leavers had higher incomes and were less likely to be in poverty than urban leavers.  Many food stamp leavers reported having fair or poor health or reported other health problems during the year prior to the interview.  There is considerable prevalence of food insecurity among food stamp leavers as a group. Food insecurity is higher among ABAWDs than among other groups of leavers.  Serious hardships are fairly common among food stamp leavers as a group, especially among ABAWDs and the elderly/disabled.  Food Stamps in South Carolina  ( Maximus ): The employment rate for ABAWD leavers was 55%. Of those who worked, the average monthly earnings was $1,229.  Work hours for ABAWD eavers averaged about 37 hours per week.  Only 16% of ABAWD leavers cited difficulty in finding a job as a reason for lack of work.  Over half (57%) the ABAWD leavers were high school dropouts.  Almost half (46%) of ABAWD leavers had household income below the poverty level, and 12% were in severe poverty.  Over half of ABAWD leavers had no health insurance of any kind, 29% reported difficulties paying for housing, and 65% had problems paying their utility bills.  Food Stamps in Iowa  ( USDA  July 2002): Nearly 58 percent of those participating in the FSP in 1997 were not participating in the program when interviewed in 1999.  Those who left the FSP in 1997 (including working age adults without dependents or a disability) had better economic and employment outcomes than others.  Adults without dependents or a disability who remained in the FSP in 1997 had the greatest hardships: They were most likely to have very low income, had less contribution from earned income, and were more likely to experience food insecurity and hunger in the last year.  Over half of all of the households in the survey had used private food assistance in the past year.  Synthesis of findings from 8 case studies  ( USDA  January 2001):   Barriers to access:  Formal or informal job search diversion policies (e.g. overzealous promotion of employment goals to the point of urging clients to visit the unemployment office before filing for food stamp benefits)  Limited office hours  Burdensome verification requirements (e.g. multiple interviews with employment-related staff before the food stamp application can be completed)  Shortened food stamp certification periods  Lack of E&T services to help ABAWDs meet their work requirement and maintain benefits (e.g. limited E&T services for non-TANF food stamp clients, particularly ABAWDs and those who were not job ready, despite, in one State, a general policy to provide these services to all clients)  Food stamp sanctions for noncompliance with TANF rules (e.g. more punitive food stamp sanctions for noncompliance with TANF rules and E&T work requirements, sometimes without opportunities for conciliation)  Privatization of the TANF eligibility process (leading to lack of coordination between TANF and food stamp certification and change reporting processes)  Local office characteristics may influence how State welfare reform policies are implemented.                                                                                                        Privacy Policy Terms of Use This site copyright © 2003 The Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York, for its National Center for Children in Poverty (NCCP).

One avenue through which these individuals can alleviate their food insecurity is food stamps. However, some of these food insecure individuals are denied access to food stamps due to citizenship status. In addition, only 38% of citizen children living in immigrant families are receiving the food stamp benefits for which they are eligible ( 2 ).    Current and Pending Federal Legislation   The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA) made most noncitizens ineligible for food stamps. Approximately one-third of these noncitizens were restored eligibility for food stamps by the Agriculture Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998. Immigrants remaining ineligible for food stamps are children who entered the U.S. after August 22, 1996, adults (18-64), those who entered the U.S. after August 22, 1996 and became disabled or reached aged 65, and refugees after seven years. (For more information about the details of these bills, see the  Issue Brief on Nutritional Assistance--01/01/99 .)    Regulations implementing the food stamp provisions of these bills were implemented by Food and Nutrition Services of the U.S. Department of Agriculture on November 21, 2000 ( 3 ).  The 80-page regulation addresses several issues relating to immigrant access to food stamps, removing some of the barriers for eligible legal immigrants and eligible members of mixed legal status households. According to the regulation, states have the option to include only a pro rata share of immigrant household income if the immigrants are ineligible for food stamps under the pre-1996 law. If immigrants were made ineligible by the 1996 law, states can decide to count a pro rata share or none of the immigrant household income, but the benefit cannot exceed the amount the immigrant would have been eligible for prior to the 1996 law. The regulation also explains immigrant sponsor deeming and exempts indigent immigrants and battered immigrants from deeming for 12 months.   As part of a broader initiative, federal legislation entitled ""Healthy Solutions for America's Hardworking Families,"" the Nutrition Assistance for Working Families and Seniors Act of 2001 would restore food stamp benefits to all legal immigrants who would otherwise be eligible. In addition to restoring immigrant access to food stamps, this bill would also make some changes to nutrition services for all recipients. By adjusting the family size standard deduction, the proposed legislation would end the child penalty. The bill would also count child support as part of the existing food stamp earnings disregard, thereby encouraging families receiving food stamps be paid child support. Over a period of three years, the minimum food stamp benefit would be increased from $10 to $25. To assist those moving from welfare to work, the bill would create a state option to initiate a fixed six-month transitional food stamp benefit. Finally, the bill would improve the availability and dissemination of food stamp eligibility and access information. Sens. Edward Kennedy (D-Massachusetts), James Jeffords (R-Vermont), and Lincoln Chafee (R-Rhode Island) introduced the bill in the Senate as S 583 on March 21.     As a result of the implementation of PRWORA, subsequent amendments, and previous legislation, the following people are eligible for food stamps:      Citizens;    Lawful permanent residents who can demonstrate 40 qualifying quarters of work;    Refugees, asylees, those whose deportation has been withheld, and Cuban, Haitians and Amerasians during their first seven years in the United States;    Veterans, active duty military, their spouses, and dependents;    Elderly immigrants who were 65 or older and present in the United States as of August 22, 1996;    Immigrants residing in the United States as of August 22, 1996, who meet the Food Stamp program's definition of disabled, regardless of when they became disabled;    Immigrant children under age 18 who were in the United States as of August 22, 1996;    Hmong and highland Lao tribe members who assisted the United States armed forces during the Vietnam War, their spouses, dependent children, and unremarried widow(er)s of those deceased; and    Certain Native Americans born in Canada or Mexico who are entitled under treaty law to reside in the United States.      State Programs and Initiatives    In 1999, Title VII of P. L. 105-18 gave states the option to purchase federal food stamps for noncitizens made ineligible for food stamp benefits solely because of their citizenship status. The following states restored benefits to some or all of those made ineligible because of their citizenship status.        States Purchasing Food Stamps for Legal Immigrants (dark gray)   States with Legislative Initiatives (light gray)     Maine ,  Minnesota ,  Nebraska ,  Washington , and  Wisconsin  extend food stamp benefits to all legal immigrants who are ineligible for Federal Food Stamps solely because of their citizenship status and regardless of date of entry. In Minnesota, non-citizens ineligible for Federal Food Stamps solely because of citizenship can receive state-funded food assistance in one of two ways. If they are eligible for the Minnesota Family Investment Program (MFIP), they qualify for food assistance through this program. If they are not eligible for MFIP, they may receive food assistance through the Minnesota Food Assistance Program (MFAP). During FY00, MFAP served 9,914 cases at a total cost of $1,073,604. However, as of July 1, 2002, only those persons 50 years of age or older will qualify for benefits under MFAP. In addition, as of July 1, 2001, legal noncitizens will no longer be eligible for state-funded assistance under MFIP. Wisconsin appropriated $4.6 million for FY98-99, and served around 4,500 noncitizens per month prior to the Agriculture Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998 and nearly 1,000 noncitizens per month after this law took effect.    California  extends food stamp benefits to all eligible legal immigrants who were admitted to the United States on or before August 22, 1996, under its California Food Assistance Program (CFAP). Legal immigrants, who entered the United States after August 22, 1996, may be eligible for benefits if their sponsors are deceased, disabled, or abusive. Battered immigrants are also eligible for food stamps. In 1999, California passed a law to provide food stamps to all noncitizens who were made ineligible solely due to their citizenship status. The program was set to run from October 1, 1999, to September 30, 2001. A bill is currently in the California Assembly to extend these benefits indefinitely (CA AB 989). In FY99, California served 253,250 non-citizens, which is 11.6% of their total served population. California also served 70,340 refugees (3.2% of their total) ( 4 ).  To continue to provide the California Food Assistance Program, the California 2000-2001 budget includes $51.1 million.   Massachusetts  has created the State Supplemental Food Stamp Program (SSFSP) to provide state-funded food stamps to noncitizens who would otherwise be eligible for food stamps. In order to receive these benefits, the noncitizen must reside in Massachusetts continuously for 60 days before applying or reapplying. Those noncitizens receiving SSFSP benefits are not subject to the deeming requirements of the Federal Food Stamp Program. For FY01, Massachusetts appropriated $7,753,772 for its State Supplemental Food Stamp Program, down from the previous year's appropriation of $8,460,369.    Connecticut  also extends food stamp benefits to legal immigrants who entered the United States prior to April 1, 1998, and are ineligible for federal food stamps solely because of citizenship. Immigrants entering the United States after April 1, 1998, must be residents of Connecticut for six months before they are eligible to receive food stamps from the state of Connecticut. Connecticut's provision of food stamps to legal immigrants was appropriated approximately $2.2 million for FY01.   Illinois  provides food stamps for elderly immigrants (60-64 years of age) if the person was in the United States before August 22, 1996. In addition, immigrant parents of eligible children are provided food stamps if they were present in the Unite States before August 22, 1996.    Elderly immigrants ages 60-68 are eligible to receive food stamps from  New York  if they have lived in the same county or New York City since August 22, 1996. Also, for FY99-00, New York's Assembly proposed $12 million of its TANF surplus be used to provide alternative food assistance to legal immigrant parents of TANF eligible children.    If a child under the age of 18 entered the United States on or after August 22, 1996,  Maryland  will provide food stamps to them if they would otherwise be eligible.  Missouri  provides food stamps to legal immigrant TANF recipients.   New Jersey  extends food stamp benefits through its Supplementary Food Stamp Program to immigrant parents or guardians of children if they entered the United States before August 22, 1996. The legislature provided a fiscal estimate during the debate of the bill that created this program; it recommended that $6.7 million be appropriated for the New Jersey Supplementary Food Stamp Program.    Rhode Island  provides benefits to legal immigrant residents of Rhode Island who were such residents before August 22, 1996.   To qualify for  Ohio's  State-Funded Food Stamp Program for Qualified Aliens, a qualified alien must 1) be ineligible for federal food stamps solely because of his/her citizenship status, 2) be eligible for supplemental security income benefits, 3) have been residing in Ohio as of and since August 22, 1996, and 4) have resided in the United States for seven years and be pursuing naturalization.   Elderly immigrant residents of  Texas  might be eligible for food stamps if they 1) entered the United States before August 22, 1996, 2) became 65 after that date but before March 1, 1998, and 3) received federal food stamps during any month from September 1996 to August 1997. A bill (TX H 1218) currently in the Texas House of Representatives would restore food stamp benefits to qualified aliens who were either 65 or older or eligible for food stamps for any time during the last month they received them before the change in law.   States with pending legislation to restore benefits to immigrants.   Hawaii H 367: This bill initiates a program to assist limited English proficient eligible immigrants as they apply for naturalization/citizenship. Program would specifically target immigrants who have lost benefits due to their citizenship status.   Oregon S 797: This bill would require that the income of ineligible household members be disregarded when calculating eligible members' food stamp benefits.     1. Andrews, Margaret, et. al.

In Colorado, less                than one third of individuals who are potentially qualified to participate                in LEAP respond with an application. The LEAP Study Team –                comprised of representatives from the Colorado Department of Human                Services, the Colorado Energy Assistance Foundation, and Excel Energy                – retained BBC Research & Consulting to investigate why.                The objectives of this research effort were to: 1) determine perceptions                of low-income energy consumers regarding the LEAP program (and governmental                assistance in general); 2) test the array of theories regarding                why eligible households do not apply for LEAP and identify barriers                that inhibit them from applying for the program; 3) explore the                eligible populations' need for energy assistance programs, and their                level of awareness about existing programs.

Prepared for the Colorado Energy                Assistance Foundation (CEAF), this study examined why eligible low-income                households in Colorado do not participate in the Low-income Energy                Assistance Program (LEAP). The study determined that the primary                barrier to participation in Colorado's LEAP is the lack of information.                Based on Colorado-specific data, persons who were disproportionately                represented in the populations that reported not knowing about LEAP                included persons aged 65 and older, non-English speaking households                (and particularly non-English/non-Spanish speaking households),                African-Americans, and unmarried households.

This report considers mechanisms                through which Iowa can seek to increase enrollment of low-income                households in LIHEAP, as well as to target outreach to selected                populations including households with elderly and disabled members                and young children. Colton drew on the conclusions from previous                studies of other benefit programs, which examined how nonparticipation                can result from institutional barriers or lack of desire or need.                The recommended outreach initiatives are divided into two parts:                1) those that can and should be pursued at the statewide administrative                level and 2) those that can and should be pursued at the local level.

The study sought to identify the factors                involved in client decision making around participation in Montana's                LIEAP. It used county level data to examine LIEAP participation                in Montana from 1992 to 1996. The analysis revealed how some program/policy,                economic and demographic factors affect participation by developing                a forecasting model to help LIEAP administrators with program planning                and budgeting. Unemployment and average benefit payments had a significant                positive relationship with LIEAP participation, while policy changes                that resulted in LIEAP eligibility restrictions had a negative effect.

The author analyzes the Basic Food   (Washington   State’s name for the Food   Stamp program) program and tries to determine what are the factors involved in a   successful outreach model. The study finds that counties (in Washington) with higher   participation rates had a collaborative and comprehensive outreach program,   whereas those with low participation did not. A comprehensive outreach program,   the authored defined, was one that offered at least three methods of outreach   and attempted to increase awareness as well as to assist potential clients with   applications. Collaboration was operationalized by having both food banks and   community service organization know about outreach efforts and by having food   stamp outreach efforts in roughly half of the local food banks.

The  Business Case for Increasing Food Stamp Participation , published by the USDA, explains that one  reason is that it helps the local economy as well as the clients. In your effort to involve a wide variety of people in your outreach efforts, be sure to use economic arguments to convince business leaders.

These are areas that outreach specialists can think about, especially   when an outreach program wishes to do advocacy work in legislatures. The issue   brief identifies several approaches states can take to improve access:                                          using   the internet and online applications                           creating a single application for multiple   programs                           establishing call centers                           aligning program policies regarding eligibility,   verification, and renewal                                              Successful Food Stamp Innovations               Successful  Food Stamp Innovations , compiled by the American Public Human Services Association, offers case studies of innovations in the Food Stamp Program that are simultaneously increasing participation and program integrity.  These case studies show what states across the nation are doing to improve efficiency in the Food Stamp Program.

If you wish to learn more, you can start by going to USDA's  explanation of their methodology . There is a step-by-step guide on the website. The PAI is meant look at how well each state's Food Stamp Programs are operating; it is NOT originally meant to look at participation. We can, however, use it as a very rough estimate for participation. A very simple explanation of the process is that it is calculated by dividing the number of people using Food Stamps by the number of people below 130% of the federal poverty line in each state.                                  The USDA also estimates the  participation rate by state , after accounting for many factors (such as assets). The  October 2006 report  estimates participation rates for 2004. This methodology is much more complicated, as the process involves using mathematical models. You may also go to the agency's website to read more detailed analyses on participation rate amongst  subpopulations with particular characteristics , such as the working poor.                                              Because of the lack of participation measurement for urban areas, Food Research and Action Center has devised its own Local Access Indicator.  Click here  for the most recent national report. The FRAC methodology is explained inside the report. The LAI is calculated by dividing the number of Food Stamps recipients by the number of potentially eligible people. The latter figure is obtained by first looking at the number of people below 130% of the poverty line, and subtracting from the figure the number of people with certain categories of immigration status, with assets above a certain limit, or with SSI (issue specific to California). If you would like help in roughly estimating the participation rate in your city, CAFB can help put you in touch with appropriate experts. You may attempt to calculate the LAI by looking at the FRAC report (link above). To find the tables named in the FRAC methodology page, follow these instructions: Go to www.census.gov, click on American FactFinder on the left-hand toolbar, then click on Data Sets on the left-hand toolbar on the FactFinder webpage, and select the appropriate section - Census tables or American Community Survey tables.                                             Urban Institute’s  study,  Employment Factors Influencing Food Stamp Program Participation , offers  some explanations for the lack of participation in FSP by many working  families. Also available here:  http://www.urban.org/UploadedPDF/410800_Employment_Factors.pdf                                             USDA's  Program Access Study  on the FSP explores ways in which policies at the local offices might promote or hinder food stamp participation.

Click on “Launch MapViewer” at the bottom of the  website to enter the Map Viewer.  First, select the scope of data  you want in the “Jump to a new location” box; for example, you may want to  limit the information to one county. The map will then reflect the parameters  you indicated. Second, on the right-hand tool bar, click on any of the  categories under the Map Layers tab to map the type of information you wish to  see. For example, to map all the WIC clinics in the area, click on the category  “Health, Nutrition” and select WIC. To view Food Stamp data, click on the  category “Demographics” and scroll down to the buttons relevant to Food Stamps.  Third, to view all the selected information in a table for downloading, click  “Go” in the Summarize Data box at the bottom. You may need to press the Control  button while you do this so that the pop-up box can appear. If you are  interested in a county map, almost all of the color coding will be done by 2000  Census blocks, which are groupings of census tracts.
