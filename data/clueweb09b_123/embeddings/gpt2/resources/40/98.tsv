Case information is kept on WCCA for 10 years      from the date of the last Court Record Event      or the minimum period of time for the case type as set by the supreme court      rules (              SCR Chapter      72 Retention and Maintenance of Court Records  ), whichever is longer. Cases kept on WCCA      longer than 10 years will be removed as follows:                                                      20 Years                 Docketed Judgments and Tax Warrants            Civil Cases (CV)            Misdemeanor and Criminal Traffic Cases (CM & CT)            Small Claims Cases (SC) except for dismissed SC cases deleted after 10           years                                             30 Years                 Family cases (FA). + 7 years if payments are ongoing                                             50 Years                 Felony Cases (CF) Class B-E                                             75 Years                 Felony Cases (CF) Class A             Commitment of an Inmate (CI)            Probate and Informal Probate (PR & IN)                                                     Top                           Why are some cases not available on WCCA?                         There are several reasons why a case may not be available on WCCA:                                                      Some older cases were not           included when the circuit court in a county automated its records. How           far back WCCA records go differs by county. See                   When counties began           using CCAP .                                                                       Case types such as           adoptions, mental commitments, and juvenile cases are confidential by           law and so are not shown on WCCA.                                             A judge may order a           misdemeanor case to be expunged if the convicted offender is under age           21. This order will delete all court records of the case included on           WCCA. See                   Clerk of Circuit Court contact information .                                                                               Top                           Why is Traffic Case Information about Juveniles available on WCCA?                         Licensed drivers ages 16 or older are treated as adults for non-criminal traffic violations.                           Top                           Is it necessary to put all non-criminal/OWI cases and     ordinance violation information on WCCA?                         By law and tradition, Wisconsin favors openness in government. Determinations about which cases appear on WCCA were finalized in March of 2002. The information that appears on WCCA represents an effort to balance these competing interests.                           Top                           Can I Access Court Cases for Other States?  CCAP does not maintain a list of court records databases for other states or jurisdictions. The State Law Library provides links to other                 court records  and                 public records  databases.                                                     Top                           Why isn't there information for Walworth County,   and for Portage County why no cases other than Probate?     CCAP is a voluntary program. Counties (or divisions within a county) that elected to use CCAP's Case Management       system have data on WCCA. We are unable to include data on WCCA for counties that do not use CCAP's Case     Management system, as we do not have access to their data in the same fashion as we do for the CCAP counties.   Walworth is scheduled to begin using CCAP's Case Management System in   2003. There are no plans for Portage at this time.                 Top                           My case was expunged; why is it still showing on WCCA?     Any case properly expunged from the individual county's database will be removed from WCCA. It may be that the   case was expunged from another system, such as the Wisconsin Department of Justice's Crime Information Bureau. If     you have questions as to why your specific case is still appearing on WCCA, contact the Clerk of Circuit Court in the                                              county where the case originated.                Top                           The information in a case is incorrect. Could you correct the information?               CCAP does not modify data contained on WCCA in any way. All the data in the CCAP database is entered in the individual counties where the case files are located. If you believe any of the data contained in this database is inaccurate, please contact the circuit court where the original record was created and filed. See  Clerk of Circuit Court contact information .                                        Top                           My judgment is satisfied; why is the judgment party status active?   A judgment party's status is always active, unless a creditor has an assigned creditor. If the creditor has an assigned creditor, the assigned creditor is 'active' and the original creditor is inactivated. The active status has nothing to do with the satisfaction of a judgment.                 Top                           What is a converted case?    A converted case is a case that existed in the county's case management system prior to using CCAP's Case Management system. Some cases were converted onto CCAP's Case Management system. Some converted and historical cases do not contain complete information. To view complete information on these cases, visit the Clerk of Court's office in the county where the case took place. Converted and historical cases have the following Court Record events:                             This converted data may be     incorrect. See file.

Bankruptcy cases are handled by the Federal Courts, not the Circuit Courts, and are therefore not available on WCCA.                            Top                           Where do I find more information about statutes?

Contact the Clerk of Circuit Court office in the county where the case was filed for additional information about any cases, judgments, or calendar activities on WCCA. See               Clerk of Circuit Court contact information .                                       Top                           How long are dismissed cases displayed?                         Cases display for the same period of time, regardless of the finding or disposition on the case. See               Question #1  for details.                                      Top                           Do cases settled out of court display on WCCA?                         Once a case is filed with the court, it will display on WCCA, even if the case was settled or dismissed.                           Top                           I keep getting the message: ""Your search has returned more than 500 rows. Please try again."" What's wrong?                          WCCA limits your results two ways. First, if a search returns more than 500 records, you will receive an error message. Second, if you search takes longer than a certain amount of time, your search will time out and you will receive an error message. For example, if you search in a county for ""Smith*"", you will likely get this message because there are more than 500 cases with a last name of Smith. Try further limiting your search by adding additional criteria, such as a first name, a filing date range, or a case type.                            Top                           After doing a 'Docketed Civil Judgment' search, some judgments have a link that reads 'Click Here' instead of a case number link. What does 'Click Here' mean?                          When you see 'Click Here' instead of a case number, the docketed civil judgment is on a confidential case. No case information will be displayed.                            Top                           Why don't I see any Court Record Additional Text on older cases?                          The information that displays on WCCA varies based on when the case was added. We display 'Finding Notes', 'Sentence Notes', the 'Miscellaneous Condition Notes', and court record 'Additional Text' for all cases filed after July 1, 2001. In addition, if the individual finding, sentence, or Court Record Event was added after July 1, 2001, the text will display on WCCA.  Finally, we display 'Probation Notes' and probation 'Time Conditions Notes' on WCCA for cases with guilty findings beginning on April 1, 2003                Top                           Why do I see the month and year in the 'Date of Birth' field for some cases and the full date of birth on others?                          For non-criminal cases, we display only the birth month and year -- we do not display the full date of birth. For criminal felony, criminal traffic, and criminal misdemeanor cases, we display the full date of birth.

GX000-53-11280401	"2001 TERM COURT ORDERS      The vast majority of cases filed in the Supreme Court are disposed of summarily by unsigned orders.  Such an order will, for example, deny a petition for certiorari without comment.  Regularly scheduled lists of orders are issued on each Monday that the Court sits, but ""miscellaneous"" orders may be issued in individual cases at any time.  Scheduled order lists are posted on this Website on the day of their issuance, while miscellaneous orders are posted on the day of issuance or the next day.    Caution:  These electronic orders may contain computer-generated errors or other deviations from the official printed versions.  Moreover, all order lists and miscellaneous orders are replaced within a few months by paginated versions of them in a preliminary print of the United States Reports, and one year after the issuance of the preliminary print by the final version of the orders in a U. S. Reports bound volume.  In case of discrepancies between the print and electronic versions of orders, the print version controls.  In case of discrepancies between order lists or miscellaneous orders and any later official version of them, the later version controls.            10/01/02   Miscellaneous Order    10/01/02   Order List    09/25/02   Miscellaneous Orders    09/18/02   Miscellaneous Order    09/17/02   Miscellaneous Orders    09/16/02   Miscellaneous Order    09/13/02   Miscellaneous Order    09/12/02   Miscellaneous Orders    09/06/02   Miscellaneous Order    09/06/02   Order List    08/26/02   Order List    08/23/02   Miscellaneous Orders    08/20/02   Miscellaneous Order    08/16/02   Miscellaneous Order    08/15/02   Miscellaneous Orders    08/14/02   Miscellaneous Orders    08/07/02   Miscellaneous Orders    08/05/02   Order List    07/29/02   Miscellaneous Order    07/23/02   Miscellaneous Order    07/17/02   Miscellaneous Order    07/10/02   Miscellaneous Orders    06/28/02   Order List    06/26/02   Miscellaneous Orders    06/25/02   Miscellaneous Orders    06/24/02   Order List    06/18/02   Miscellaneous Order    06/17/02   Order List    06/11/02   Miscellaneous Order    06/10/02   Order List    06/03/02   Order List    05/28/02   Miscellaneous Order    05/28/02   Order List    05/24/02   Miscellaneous Order    05/22/02   Miscellaneous Orders    05/21/02   Miscellaneous Order    05/20/02   Order List    05/16/02   Miscellaneous Order    05/13/02   Order List    05/12/02   Miscellaneous Orders    05/09/02   Miscellaneous Order    05/08/02   Miscellaneous Order    05/07/02   Miscellaneous Orders    05/06/02   Miscellaneous Order    05/03/02   Miscellaneous Orders    05/01/02   Miscellaneous Order    04/30/02   Miscellaneous Orders    04/29/02   Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure    04/29/02   Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure    04/29/02   Federal Rules of Civil Procedure    04/29/02   Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure    04/29/02   Order List    04/25/02   Miscellaneous Orders    04/24/02   Miscellaneous Orders    04/22/02   Order List    04/15/02   Order List    04/12/02   Miscellaneous Order    04/10/02   Miscellaneous Orders    04/09/02   Miscellaneous Order    04/08/02   Miscellaneous Orders    04/04/02   Miscellaneous Order    04/01/02   Order List    03/25/02   Order List    03/18/02   Order List    03/15/02   Miscellaneous Order    03/13/02   Miscellaneous Order    03/12/02   Miscellaneous Order    03/05/02   Miscellaneous Order    03/04/02   Order List    03/01/02   Miscellaneous Order    02/28/02   Miscellaneous Order    02/25/02   Order List    02/19/02   Order List    02/15/02   Miscellaneous Orders    02/14/02   Miscellaneous Order    02/08/02   Miscellaneous Order    02/05/02   Miscellaneous Orders    01/30/02   Miscellaneous Order    01/29/02   Miscellaneous Orders    01/28/02   Miscellaneous Order    01/24/02   Order List    01/24/02   Miscellaneous Orders    01/23/02   Miscellaneous Order    01/22/02   Order List    01/14/02   Order List    01/11/02   Order List    01/10/02   Miscellaneous Orders    01/07/02   Order List    01/04/02   Order List    01/03/02   Miscellaneous Order    12/12/01   Miscellaneous Order    12/11/01   Miscellaneous Order    12/10/01   Order List    12/03/01   Order List    11/26/01   Order List    11/21/01   Order List    11/15/01   Miscellaneous Orders    11/14/01   Miscellaneous Orders    11/13/01   Order List    11/08/01   Order List    11/06/01   Miscellaneous Orders    10/29/01   Order List    10/25/01   Miscellaneous Orders    10/23/01   Miscellaneous Order    10/22/01   Miscellaneous Order    10/18/01   Miscellaneous Order    10/17/01   Miscellaneous Order    10/16/01   Miscellaneous Order    10/15/01   Order List    10/09/01   Miscellaneous Order    10/09/01   Order List    10/03/01   Miscellaneous Order    10/02/01   Miscellaneous Order    10/01/01   Miscellaneous Order    10/01/01   Order List                 HOME  |  ABOUT THE COURT  |  DOCKET  |  ORAL ARGUMENTS  |  BAR ADMISSIONS  |  COURT RULES   CASE HANDLING GUIDES  |  OPINIONS  |  ORDERS  |  VISITING THE COURT  |  PUBLIC INFORMATION  |  RELATED WEBSITES           (To view PDF files)       Adobe Access PDF to HTML conversion      Last Updated: October 2, 2002  Page Name: http://www.supremecourtus.gov/orders/01ordersofthecourt.html"
