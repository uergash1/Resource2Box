(osa di Parmameans it stuffed with Parmigiano-Reggiano and prosciutto.) Typically made with beef, it is equally delicious and more economical made with pork tenderloin and ideal for entertaining parties of 8 to 10. Seek out true Italian Prosciutto di Parma and Parmigiano-Reggiano for this dishven though they are more costly, the superior flavor is worth the expense.                       Makes 10 servings               ACTIVE TIME:  25 minutes               TOTAL TIME:  55 minutes               EASE OF PREPARATION:  Moderate                 2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh sage  1 1/2 teaspoons minced garlic  1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh rosemary  1 teaspoon kosher salt  1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper  2 pork tenderloins (1-1 1/4 pounds each), trimmed  4 thin slices Italian Parma ham (Prosciutto di Parma), divided  1 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, divided  3 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided                1. Combine sage, garlic, rosemary, salt and pepper in a small bowl. Set aside.   2. Preheat oven to 450°F.  3. Youe going to double butterfly the tenderloins, so they can be flattened, stuffed and rolled. To do that, youl make two long horizontal cuts, one on each side, dividing the tenderloin in thirds without cutting all the way through. Working with one tenderloin at a time, lay it on a cutting board. Holding the knife blade flat, so it parallel to the board, make a lengthwise cut into the side of the tenderloin one-third of the way down from the top, stopping short of the opposite edge so that the flaps remain attached. Rotate the tenderloin 180°. Still holding the knife parallel to the cutting board, make a lengthwise cut into the side opposite the original cut, starting two-thirds of the way down from the top of the tenderloin and taking care not to cut all the way through. Open up the 2 cuts so you have a large rectangle of meat. Use the heel of your hand to gently flatten the meat to about 1/2 inch thick.   4. Cover each butterflied tenderloin with 2 of the ham slices, then spread 1/2 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano over the ham, leaving a 1-inch border. Starting with a long side, roll up each tenderloin so the stuffing is in a spiral pattern; then tie the roasts at 2-inch intervals with kitchen string.   5. Lightly brush the roasts all over with 1 1/2 teaspoons oil then rub with the reserved herb mixture. Heat the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons oil in a large, heavy, ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add the roasts, bending to fit if necessary, and cook, turning often, until the outsides are browned, 3 to 5 minutes total.   6. Transfer the pan to the oven and roast, checking often, until the internal temperature reaches 145°F, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board, tent with foil and let rest for 5 minutes. To serve, remove the string and cut the pork into 1-inch-thick slices.

Double butterfly instructions were clear and easy to follow. Thank you for a memorable Easter dinner!   Anonymous, San Francisco, CA        This was relatively easy, after getting past the anxiety of butterflying each of the loins properly.  It was incredibly delicious.  I am not a big pork fan, and I am a cook who usually doesn't eat what I prepare, but I ate it right along with my family and enjoyed it immensely.  One note, I substituded mozzerella for the parm, which gave the meat a cheesier inside.    , Hoboken, NJ        This was outstanding. It was relatively easy to prepare but looked like I had slaved for hours, which is the kind of meal I like! Everyone enjoyed it and asked for seconds.   Anonymous, Aurora, IL        While the visual impact of prosciutto slices would have been more dynamic...the store only had minced...but the flavor was awsome. The whole family loved it. A keeper!   Wolfer, OR        I've made this a few times and it's delicious! I don't even bother to butterfly the loins I just make a slice through the center, but not all the way through obviously, put the stuff in and then fold the flap back over. It's one of my favorite recipes!   Cassie, NJ                   EATINGWELL EDITORS' PICKS               Quick and Healthy Dinners       Make easy, delicious and healthy meals in 15-30 minutes.

It is identified as 1” to 2” in length and can be a variety of colors, more commonly a golden brown.    Like the date, there are several different varieties of figs depending upon the region in which they are grown. When ripe they have a texture similar to a peach, but should be firm, not soft or mushy. In the Middle East one of the most popular recipes for figs is Figs in Syrup, a light desert containing figs drizzled with a sweet syrup.  The fig fruit comes from the fig tree popularly known as the Common Fig. When ripe, the fig fruit is harvested and can be eaten both fresh and dry. Although figs have gained a reputation from the popular cookie, Fig Newtons, fresh figs have an altogether different taste, similar to a strawberry and peach. For those that are health conscious, figs contain more fiber than any other fruit or vegetable, as well as antioxidants.  Figs can sometimes be difficult to find, but they are definitely worth looking for. Most likely they will be found in the produce section of grocery stores, or dried in the baking section. In the U.S. fig season is usually around July and August and lasts only a few months. Dried figs can be found all year long. When purchasing fresh figs, look for fruit that is slightly soft. Fresh figs are highly perishable so purchase only if they will be used within a day or two. Check the fruit to make sure they are not bruised and have a deep, rich color. To store fresh figs, keep in the refrigerator, covered or wrapped. Again, fresh figs will only last a couple of days at most so use as soon as possible.  Dried figs, on the other hand, will last several months when stored wrapped in the refrigerator or a cool, dry place away from light. To prepare, wash fresh figs thoroughly and remove its stem. Dried figs can be used or eaten immediately as is.            Related Articles Fig Varieties. Choosing the right variety for your recipe. Fig Selection and Storage Information.

God does not heal the sick without the aid of the means of healing which lie within the reach of man; or when men refuse to be benefited by the simple remedies that God has provided in pure air and water. When the Lord told Hezekiah that He would spare his life for fifteen years, and as a sign that He would fulfill His promise, caused the sun to go back ten degrees, why did He not put His direct, restoring power upon the King? He told him to apply a bunch of figs to His sore, and that natural remedy, blessed by God, healed him. The God of nature directs the human agent to use natural remedies now.” -   2 SM 286-7         INTERNAL   Fig Juice   made from soaked figs aids:  Sore Throat  Cough  Digestive Ulcers  As a laxative         EXTERNAL   As a poultice:  Split open fig and soak in warm water.   Use on:   Inflamed boil  Gum and teeth abscess  Pain  Scar Tissues     Place thin layer of gauze over affected area then apply fig poultice. Change every eight hours or twice daily.                                                                                 Amazing Health © Copyright 2007.             "

Pat tenderloins dry and dredge in spice mixture until evenly coated.                                                                       Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but  not smoking. Reduce heat to moderate and cook pork, turning occasionally, until meat is browned on all sides and thermometer inserted diagonally into center of each tenderloin registers  145°F, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer pork with tongs to a cutting board (reserve skillet) and let stand 10 minutes.                                                                       While pork stands, pour off and discard any fat from skillet, then add pomegranate juice to skillet and boil over moderately high heat until reduced to about 2/3 cup, about 3 minutes (if side of skillet begins to scorch, reduce heat to moderate). Stir together cornstarch and water and whisk into juice, then boil sauce until thickened slightly, 1 to 2 minutes.                                                                       Remove from heat and add Sherry vinegar to taste, then swirl in butter until incorporated. Pour sauce through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl and skim off  any fat. Season with salt. Slice pork and serve with sauce.                                       add your own note                                                     see all 55 reviews & comments  ›              write your

                           Figs, one of mankind’s oldest fruits, is only now receiving its due attention in homes across the United States. Although considered a fruit, the fig is actually a flower inverted into itself. They are the only fruit to ripen on the tree. Originally native from Turkey to northern India, the fig fruit spread to many of the Mediterranean countries. The primary producers of dried figs today are the United States, Turkey, Greece, and Spain. This highly nutritious fruit arrived in the United States by Spanish missionaries settling in Southern California in 1759. Fig trees were soon planted throughout the state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 One serving of figs is 40 grams, about cup, or about 3 Calimyrna figs or about 4 to 5 Mission figs. Figs are high in fiber, providing 20% of the Daily Value — more dietary fiber per serving than any other common dried or fresh fruit. Varieties There are hundreds of fig varieties but the following are most commonly found in today’s markets. The Calimyrna Fig:  Is known for its nut-like flavor and golden skin. This type is commonly eaten as is.  The Mission Fig:  Was named for the mission fathers who planted the fruit along the California coast. This fig is a deep purple which darkens to a rich black when dried.                                                                                         The Kadota Fig:  Is the American version of the original Italian Dattato fig, that is thick-skinned with a creamy amber color when ripe. Practically seedless, this fig is often canned and dried.  The Brown Turkey Fig:  has copper-colored skin, often with hints of purple, and white flesh that shades to pink in the center. This variety is used exclusively for the fresh fig market. Availability Fresh figs are available July through September. Dried figs are never out of season, and are available all year. You can find them in your favorite grocery store in the produce or dried fruit section.                                                                                         Selection Look for figs that are soft and smell sweet. Handle carefully because their fragile skins bruise easily. Storage Store fully ripened figs in the refrigerator up to 2 days; bring to room temperature before serving. Using Dried Figs As a Replacement For Fat in Your Recipes Dried figs are excellent replacement for fat in baked goods. Just remember when using dried figs to replace shortening or oil in baking do not overmix or overbake. Use only half of the normal amount of shortening, margarine, butter or oil, in a recipe when using dried puree. For instance, if 1 cup of margarine is called for, use only cup. Then use of the fig puree.  Here’s a simple fig puree recipe to include in your baking recipes.

Serve mashed or cubed winter squash or sweet potatoes with some chopped figs. The figs are rich on their own, so skip the butter or margarine.

Figs are thought to be one of the oldest cultivated fruit, dating back over 6000  years, so it seems fitting that they should have a week to themselves and  National Fig Week is the ideal time to celebrate these flowers. Flowers? Yes,  figs are indeed inverted flowers, so not strictly speaking a fruit but for the  purpose of this editorial, wel continue to call them fruit.          Monika Adamczyk  - Fotolia.com    Unlike many fruit, figs don contain much vitamin C, however nutritionally,  they outgun most others in numerous ways. They are a better source of vitamin  B6, have higher quantities of minerals, including potassium, and contain dietary  fibre than many other fruit. As a consequence of the high fibre content, figs  are a mild laxative. Dried figs are also an excellent source of calcium    Historically figs have been referred to and revered from the earliest of times,  though we doubt there was a National Fig week.  They are mentioned in the first book of The Bible (Genesis) and some scholars  believe the forbidden fruit picked by Eve was a fig rather than an apple, which  would actually make more sense as it supposed to be a fig leaf which Adam  chose to rotect his modesty. The ancient Greeks are believed to have fed figs  to their athletes (Spartans) to induce strength and vitality and the Roman's  gave fresh figs to their agricultural slaves to help keep them fit and therefore  able to work harder. Not forgetting old Cleopatra with her basket of figs hiding  the asp .    Figs are also considered a symbol of fertility in many cultures possibly because  each fruit contains between 30 and 1,000 seedsometimes more.    Whatever the reason, be it for its nutritional values or its exquisite taste,  below are some recipes to help you celebrate National Fig week.

Dried figs are a good source of fiber.

Whether you savor flavorful figs as a snack or in your favorite                      recipes, figs are always rich in complex carbohydrates, a                      good source of dietary fiber and a wealth of essential minerals                      such as potassium, iron and calcium.                                             It                      may surprise you to know that when y ou eat a  h alf-cu p of                       figs                      you get as much calcium as when you drink a half-cup of milk.                      Figs                       are deliciously portable, so they are readily available                      as calcium-rich                       snacks at home, at work, at play or on the                      road. Needed for strong bones and teeth, calcium is the most                      abundant mineral in the body, but one that often is lacking                      in diets. Growing teens and women have especially high needs                      for calcium.                                             Figs - No Fat and High in Nutrients                      Because they have no fat, saturated fat, cholesterol or sodium,                      figs help you meet today’s Dietary Guidelines established                      by the U.S. Department                       of Agriculture. Health organizations                      recommend a diet low in fat, high in vitamins, minerals and                      dietary fiber to help lower the risk of heart disease and                      some types of cancer.                                            Figs’ full flavor and chewy texture make them a tasty,                      nutritious addition                       to your healthful diet. Use the Nutrition                     Facts label to discover all the nutrition packed into a                    serving  of figs. If you eat more than the 1 1⁄2                      ounce                     serving  of figs described on the Blue Ribbon Orchard Choice                     or                       Sun-Maid  package label, adjust your nutrient intake upward.                                            Total carbohydrate and sugars are listed on the nutrition                      label. Carbohydrate, the body’s preferred energy source,                      comes mainly from plant foods: fruits such as figs, grains,                      and vegetables. The USDA’s Food Guide Pyramid recommends                      these complex carbohydrates for the basis                       of healthful diets.                      Two to four servings daily of fruit are recommended. Sugars                      refer to the natural fruit sugars in figs that give figs their                      sweetness.                                             Dietary                      fiber, found only in plant foods, aids digestion, and may                      help reduce the risk of some types of cancer, according to                      the National Cancer Institute’s 5 a Day for Better Health                      program. Most Americans fail to get even half of the recommended                      25 to 30 grams daily. Figs are a good source of dietary fiber                      - about 5 grams a serving.                                           Tips on Storing and Handling Figs                                           Use a sharp knife or a pair of scissors to cut up figs.                        Run the knife under hot water when it gets sticky.                       Sometimes the natural sugars in figs come to the surface                        and form crystals. If you want to remove the sugar crystals:                                                1. Place 1/2 cup figs in a microwave-safe dish.                         2. Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon water.                       3. Cover loosely and microwave on high for one minute.                       Store figs in refrigerator after opening.                       While figs are available year-round, they also can be                      kept in the freezer for up to one year.                                         Fascinating Facts About Figs                                           Fig trees have no blossoms on their                          branches. The blossom is inside of the fruit! Many tiny                          flowers produce the crunchy little seeds that give figs                        their unique texture.                       Figs are harvested according to nature’s                        clock, fully ripened and partially dried on the tree.                       Figs naturally help hold in moisture                        in baked goods, keeping them fresher.                       Fig puree can be used to replace fat                        in baked goods.

California grows many varieties of                          figs, but the two most common are the golden, slightly nutty-flavored                        Calimyrna and the dark, sweet Mission.                                                                                                                                                             Fig Information                                         -Fascinating Fig Facts                     -Growing and Processing                     -Ingredient/Food Service                      -Organic Figs                     -Consumer Comments                                                                           Home  |  About           Us  |  Industry News  |  About           Figs  |  Retailers  |  Ingredient/Food           Service  | Recipes  |  Comments           Valley Fig Growers • 2028 South Third St., Fresno, California           93702•  (559) 237-3893  © 2004 Valley Fig Growers • eMail:  info@valleyfig.com  •  Legal Disclaimer

Preheat oven to 425F. Heat 1 teaspoon of the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add onion, jalapeo and garlic; saut until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add molasses, vinegar, mustard and soy sauce; reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until quite thick, about 7 minutes. 2. Rub tenderloins generously with black pepper. Heat the remaining 1 teaspoon oil in a medium ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add the tenderloins and cook, turning, until well browned on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes. 3. Brush the pork generously with some of the barbecue sauce. Place the skillet in the oven and roast for 7 minutes. Turn over the tenderloins and brush them with remaining sauce and roast for 7 to 8 minutes more, or until the internal temperature is 160F. Let the pork rest for 5 minutes. Carve into 3/4-inch-thick slices and serve.

A classically trained chef shows you how to prepare the pork, plus how to make sauce in five steps.

Today we're making a roast pork tenderloin with an amazing apple Dijon pan sauce.   Remove the Silver Skin From the Pork  There's our whole pork tenderloin. It's about a pound and a half -- a really beautiful piece of meat. The only trimming we have to do is to take off the silver skin with a sharp knife.    There's the slow-mo version of how to do it. Just put the knife in between the silver skin and the meat.    I didn't have three minutes to show you how to do it all, so three minutes later, all that was gone. It's very easy. You can do it, just use a sharp knife.   Fold the Tail Piece of the Pork Tenderloin  Now see that little tail piece, how that's thinner than the rest of the pork? I'm going to use a knot and just fold that up and tie it. That way, it's all the same thickness. See that? Pretty good trick.   Marinate the Pork Tenderloin  OK, cover that with black pepper. For our marinade, we're going to use some garlic, three cloves, and some rosemary, which we are going to bruise. This just means to pound it with the back of your knife.    Throw all that in a bag and add a tablespoon of olive oil and your pork. And then give it a nice little massage to distribute all the garlic and rosemary. All right, you are going to throw that in the fridge for four to 12 hours.   Preheat your oven to 375F. When you remove it from the marinade, take off the garlic and rosemary so it doesn't burn in the pan. We're going to salt it well.   Sear the Pork Tenderloin  And here are your 5 steps for any pan sauce: sear it, roast it, deglaze the pan, reduce the sauce, and finish with butter -- my favorite step!   So, here's the searing. We're going to put a tablespoon of oil in a very hot pan. We're going to sear that pork tenderloin - I'm going to put it fold side down - and we're going to sear it 3-4 minutes per side on high heat to get a nice crust going. So that's the searing.   Roast the Pork Tenderloin  The roasting is of course the roasting. I'm going to go 20 minutes at 375F, or if you want to go internal temperature, I go 165F, which comes out nice and moist. So now that we've taken that pork out to rest, we are ready to deglaze the bottom of the pan.   Deglaze the Bottom of the Pan and Reduce  We're going to add our liquids; our cider vinegar, which is a 1/4 cup; our couple tablespoons of Dijon; our two cups of apple cider. And that's the deglazing.   Now on high, heat the reduction. We're simply going to reduce that liquid down buy 3/4 until it kind of looks like that. Turn off the heat.   Add Butter to the Apple Dijon Pan Sauce  Add two tablespoons of cold butter, and whisk until incorporated. Just whisk it all in. It will come together, it will thicken it.    Now what's happening is the vinegar in the reduction is helping emulsify the butter into the sauce, and that's what gives it that shine and that incredible texture.    Season and Strain the Pan Sauce  Be sure to adjust for salt and pepper. And just to be fancy I'm going to strain mine, you know, just to look professional.   I'm going to add 1 teaspoon of fresh minced rosemary for some color after I strain it.    Top the Pork With the Pan Sauce  Slice your meat on the bias -- it just looks cool. Top with that amazing sauce, and you have an incredible, incredible pork dish.    And the important thing to remember is that if you follow those five steps you can make a delicious pan sauce out of any roasted meat. I hope you give it a try. Enjoy!   Thanks for watching.

Serve this delicious, succulent pork tenderloin with a tart and flavorful cranberry pomegranate sauce. In the summer months, I highly recommend substituting cranberries with cherries for an equally delicious sauce. Cook Time: 30 minutes Ingredients: 1 pound pork tenderloin 2 tbsp salt-free poultry seasoning 1 cup pomegranate juice (such as Pom brand) 1/4 cup sugar 1 1/2 cups fresh cranberries Preparation:  Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Trim pork tenderloin of excess fat, and silver skin. Spray pork briefly with nonstick cooking spray. Rub with poultry seasoning.   Place pork in a small, shallow roasting pan, tucking thin end of tenderloin under to ensure even roasting.   Roast for 20-25 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer reads 155 degrees Fahrenheit and the juices run clear.   Remove from oven, and place on a platter and cover loosely with foil.   Meanwhile, heat pomegranate juice, sugar and cranberries in a small saucepan on medium high until boiling, stirring occasionally; reduce heat to medium low and cook until sauce thickens and reduces.   Slice pork into 8, and serve sauce in a sauce boat alongside the pork, or drizzle sauce on top of pork.

Diehl, licensed to About.com          Sliced into rounds and served with dill-creamed potatoes, roasted prune-stuffed tenderloin is a beautiful dish for either company or family dinners. Prep Time: 25 minutes Cook Time: 1 hours,  Ingredients: one 2-3 pound pork tenderloin  12 pitted prunes 3 Tbsp. butter 1/2 tsp. ground ginger 1 1/2 tsp. kosher salt 1/2 tsp. freshly ground pepper 1 1/2 cups plus 2 Tbsp. water 1 Tbsp. cornstarch Preparation:   Soak prunes in hot water until plump, about 10-15 minutes. Preheat oven to 325º.   Using a sharp knife, slit tenderloin open length-wise, so that it looks like an envelope. Drain plumped prunes and insert into tenderloin in a row. Tie pork back together with kitchen string. Combine the ground ginger, salt, and pepper, then rub mixture well all over the meat.   Melt butter in roasting pan on top of stove, then sear tenderloin on all sides until nicely brown. Pour 1 1/2 cups water around pork in pan. Transfer pan to heated oven. Roast meat, uncovered, for 1 hour or until meat thermometer registers 160ºF, basting with pan juices every 20 minutes.  Transfer meat to cutting board, remove string, and carefully slice into rounds. Place slices on serving platter and tent with aluminum foil until serving.  For gravy : Strain pan juices and return to roasting pan. Heat on stove, bringing to a light boil. Whisk together cornstarch and 2 Tbsp. water until smooth; quickly stir into juices until gravy is smooth and thick.    Yield: Serves 5-6 (can be doubled).

The herb and garlic stuffing is balanced by the sweetness of the currants, and pairs perfectly with the tender pork and light sauce.   Makes 4 Portions of Stuffed Pork Tenderloin     Prep Time: 20 minutes Cook Time: 30 minutes Ingredients: 1 whole pork tenderloin (about 1 1/4 pound) 1 tsp salt 1 tsp black pepper 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 tbsp minced fresh rosemary 1/4 cup chopped fresh Italian parsley 1 egg, beaten 1/3 cup bread crumbs 2 tbsp olive oil pinch of cayenne 2 tbsp dried currants, or chopped raisins Preparation:     With a sharp knife, butterfly the pork by cutting about 2/3rds of the way down into the tenderloin (lengthwise, from the larger end to the tail end). Be careful not to cut all the way through. Open up the tenderloin, and place between 2 pieces of plastic wrap. Flatten with a meat pounder to about 1/2-inch thick. Remove the top piece of plastic, and season with salt and fresh ground black pepper to taste.   Add the rest of the ingredients to a bowl, add a pinch of salt and pepper, and mix together with a fork to combine. Spread the stuffing evenly on the pork, leaving at least 2 inches bare on the top edge. Starting at the edge closest to you, roll the pork up firmly, but without pressing out the stuffing.    Once rolled up, make a tie every inch or so with kitchen twine. Season the outside with salt and fresh ground black pepper to taste, and brown in a hot pan, in vegetable oil, for 2-3 minutes per side. Transfer to a 9 x12 baking dish and roast in a preheat 375 degree F. oven for 30 minutes. Remove and let rest for 15 minutes.   While the pork is resting, add 1 tbsp of Dijon mustard, and 1/2 cup of chicken stock to the hot baking dish, and scrap any of the drippings of the bottom with a spatula. Whisk until the mustard is incorporated, season with salt and fresh ground black pepper to taste, and pour into a small serving bowl. Untie the pork, and cut in 1/2-inch slices, and serve with some of the mustard pan sauce.

The sweet apple cider combines beautifully with the tangy Dijon mustard. Pork tenderloin is low in fat, and cooks in just 30 minutes.    Makes 4-6 Portions of Apple Dijon Pork Tenderloin     Prep Time: 10 minutes Cook Time: 30 minutes Ingredients: 2 tbsp vegetable oil 2 pork tenderloin, trimmed of excess fat fresh ground black pepper to taste salt to taste 1 clove garlic, crushed 2 tbsp cider vinegar 2 cups apple cider, or juice 1/4 cup Dijon mustard 1 tbsp fresh rosemary, minced 2 tbsp cold butter Preparation:     Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.     Season the pork tenderloins well with black pepper and salt to taste. Heat the vegetable oil in a large frying pan, over med-high heat, until it begins to smoke. Sear the pork on all sides, about 2 minutes per side. Turn off the heat and transfer to a shallow baking pan. Roast the pork for about 30 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees F.     While the pork is cooking, pour off the excess oil from the frying pan. Place over high heat, and add the garlic. Cook for just 30 seconds, and then add the vinegar, apple cider, Dijon mustard, and rosemary. Cook until the sauce reduces by about 2/3, and begins to slightly thicken. Turn off the heat, and whisk in the cold butter, stirring constantly until the butter is gone. Taste and adjust seasoning.     Remove the pork from the oven and move to a platter. Allow to rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving with the warm sauce.      Note: Pork tenderloin is a very tender and lean cut of pork, and should not be served well-done. Pork is completely safe to eat cooked medium, and may be slightly pink in color if cooked properly.

I have never made one that I kept, so I'll skip that part, but I do know that the scales await me so it is the time to think about light (and easy) meals.  Pork is still a wonderful winter choice. The price is right, it is low in fat, and it can be made very tasty. The following recipe is a bit sweet, a bit tart and, best of all, it is very easy to prepare.                           Maple Mustard Pork Tenderloin 2 -  pound pork tenderloins Cooking spray  cup Dijon mustard 6 Tablespoons maple syrup, divided 1 Tablespoon chopped fresh (or 1 teaspoon dried) rosemary  teaspoon salt  teaspoon pepper 4 medium Granny Smith apples, peeled and cut into 16 wedges Preheat oven to 425. Trim fat and place on broiler pan coated with cooking spray. Combine mustard, 2 Tablespoons of maple syrup, rosemary, and salt and pepper in a bowl and brush on pork. Bake at 425 for approximately 25 minutes.  While pork is baking, heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add apples and saut for 5 minutes or until lightly browned. Reduce heat to low and add 4 Tablespoons of maple syrup. Simmer 10 minutes or until apples are tender, stirring occasionally. And dinner is ready to be served along with roasted brussel sprouts and orzo with sauted red peppers. Happy New Year to all...

Also, the sweet and tangy sauce, made in the pan after the meat is cooked, pairs perfectly with the black pepper crust on the pork.    Makes 4-6 Portions of Black Cherry Pork Tenderloin     Prep Time: 10 minutes Cook Time: 30 minutes Ingredients: 2 pork tenderloin, trimmed of excess fat cracked black pepper to taste salt to taste 2 tbsp vegetable oil 1 clove garlic, crushed 1/3 cup balsamic vinegar 1 cup chicken stock 1/2 cup black cherry preserves 2 tbsp cold butter Preparation:     Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.     Coat the pork tenderloins well with cracked black pepper, and salt to taste. Heat the vegetable oil, in a large frying pan, over med-high heat until it begins to smoke. Sear the pork on all sides, about 2 minutes per side. Turn off the heat and transfer to a shallow baking pan. Roast the pork for about 25-30 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 140 degrees F.     While the pork is cooking, pour off the excess oil from the frying pan. Place over high heat, and add the garlic. Cook for just 30 seconds, and then add the vinegar, cherry preserves, and chicken stock. Cook until the sauce reduces by about half, and begins to slightly thicken, about 5 minutes. Turn off the heat, and whisk in the cold butter, stirring constantly until the butter is gone. Taste and adjust seasoning.     Remove the pork from the oven and move to a platter. Allow to rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving with the warm sauce.      Note: Pork tenderloin is a very tender and lean cut of pork, and should not be served well-done. Pork is completely safe to eat cooked medium, and may be slightly pink in color if cooked properly.

Pork Tenderloin with Curried Fruit Sauce    1 pork tenderloin 1/2 cup diced pineapple with juice 1 tablespoon raisins 2 Roma tomatoes, diced 1 tablespoon curry powder 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 2 cloves crushed garlic 1 cube chicken bouillon 1/2 cup water    Bake whole pork tenderloin covered at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 25-30 minutes.  While it's baking, combine other ingredients in a saucepan and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat slightly and simmer until tomatoes and pineapple begin to cook down and the sauce thickens slightly.  Remove tenderloin from oven, slice into medallions, pour sauce over meat, and return to oven.  Bake uncovered for another 25-30 minutes.  Serve over steamed rice.  Serves 2.       I used canned pineapple, but fresh would be much tastier.  Instead of white rice, it might be interesting to go with brown rice or couscous - anything neutral to counter the spicy sauce.  As a side dish, I sauteed fresh green beans in olive oil with a little bit of salt, sesame seeds and red pepper flakes as garnish.

It totally rocks!             Posted by:    Pharmgirl |     March 29, 2005 at 09:35 AM                          This sounds fantastic.  I'm going to try it tonight with porkchops.

large measuring cup, mix together olive oil, herbes de Provence, and garlic. Place tenderloin in a large, rectangular baking pan. Pour olive oil mixture over meat, and turn to coat. Cover, and refrigerate for 3 hours.                                                                                                      Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Soak mushrooms in boiling hot water for 10 minutes to rehydrate.                                                                                                      Heat a large skillet over high heat. Remove meat from marinade, and discard any remaining marinade. Place meat in hot pan, and brown evenly. Return meat to baking dish.                                                                                                      Cook tenderloin in preheated oven about 15 to 20 minutes, or until the internal temperature of the meat is 150 degrees F (65 degrees C). Remove from oven, and allow it to rest for 5 minutes before slicing.                                                                                                      Meanwhile, combine the water in which the mushrooms were soaked, cognac, lemon juice, and shallots in a saucepan. Cook over medium heat until liquid is almost gone. Pour in the cream. Bring to a boil, and then reduce heat to medium-low. Chop mushrooms, and stir into the sauce. Continue cooking until the sauce thickens. Stir in the butter and honey. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Not only is it low in fat but is highly adaptable to many recipes. Tenderloin is also easy to grill. The biggest problem you might have is drying. Because the tenderloin is so low in fat it can dry quickly on the grill. There are four tricks to juicy, tender and flavorful pork tenderloin. Start with a well trimmed tenderloin making sure to remove any of the ""silver"" skin from the surface. The silver skin is a shiny membrane you typically find on tenderloins.    Once you have the tenderloin trimmed and ready prepare a brine. You will need about a quart of water with 2-3 tablespoons of plain or kosher salt. Place the tenderloin in the brine and refrigerate for about 12 hours.    To enhance the flavor of the tenderloin, use a rub, wet or dry. This can be a simple coating of garlic and pepper or whatever you prefer for pork. While the brine helps to add moisture to the meat the rub will add flavor and create a crust over the surface while it grills.    The third trick in getting your tenderloin just right is in the grilling. Once the tenderloin has been removed from the brine, dried off and coated with a rub it's time to put it on the grill. Have your grill good and hot; a double layer of coals for charcoal or the high setting on your gas grill. Now the real trick here is to treat the tenderloin like it has four sides. Being a long round roast you need to get the insides cooked through without burning the surface. Grill the tenderloin for about 3 to 4 minutes on each of its four sides.    The last thing to do is remove the tenderloin from the grill when its internal temperature reaches 145o. Of course this is a little low for pork, so what you do is cover the tenderloin with foil and let it stand for about 5 minutes. Because grilling uses a very high heat food will continue to cook after they are removed from the grill. Use this to let the tenderloin reach around 150o before you serve it. Make sure that you place the resting tenderloin in a spot where it won't be artificially cooled.    Once done, slice the tenderloin about 1 inch thick and serve.

Pork Tenderloin By  Linda Larsen , About.com    Filed In: Recipes by Ingredient   >  Start With Series      Southwest Pork Tenderloin Linda Larsen            Pork tenderloin is ideal for quick cooking.  This most tender and flavorful cut of pork is very lean.  There's no waste either, since the tenderloins are trimmed before you buy them.  Because the cut is so lean, tenderloin should be cooked quickly.  If you cut a tenderloin into rounds or medallions, it will cook in minutes on a dual-contact indoor grill.  Each tenderloin usually weighs about 1 to 1-1/4 pounds.  Pork is cooked in minutes per pound.  So roast a tenderloin at 425 degrees F for 15-20 minutes per pound and grill it over medium coals for 15-25 minutes per pound.  The internal temperature should be 155 to 160 degrees F.  One of the quickest meals in the market starts with a marinated pork tenderloin.  Several companies produce this product.  Just cook and eat!

Serve with black beans and rice.                      Makes 6 servings               ACTIVE TIME:  30 minutes               TOTAL TIME:  50 minutes               EASE OF PREPARATION:  Easy                 2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided  1/2 small onion, finely chopped  1 jalapeño pepper, seeded and finely chopped  1 clove garlic, finely chopped  1/4 cup molasses  1/4 cup cider vinegar  2 tablespoons Dijon mustard  2 teaspoons reduced-sodium soy sauce  2 3/4-pound pork tenderloins, trimmed  Freshly ground pepper to taste                1. Preheat oven to 425°F. Heat 1 teaspoon of the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add onion, jalapeño and garlic; sauté until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add molasses, vinegar, mustard and soy sauce; reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until quite thick, about 7 minutes.   2. Rub tenderloins generously with black pepper. Heat the remaining 1 teaspoon oil in a medium ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add the tenderloins and cook, turning, until well browned on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes.  3. Brush the pork generously with some of the barbecue sauce. Place the skillet in the oven and roast for 7 minutes. Turn over the tenderloins and brush them with remaining sauce and roast for 7 to 8 minutes more, or until the internal temperature is 160°F. Let the pork rest for 5 minutes. Carve into 3/4-inch-thick slices and serve.

Has everyone been cooking pork tenderloin all this time, licking their lips and  giggling covertly  as I fought to make other cuts palatable, trying my best to prevent them from turning out dry, and grey?    Oh, it's not that I haven't been happy with my pork experiments, not at all. Looking through the C&Z archives, I've found five recipes involving our pink friend -- a  cured pork shoulder with lentils , a  loin blade roast stewed in cider , a  roast with spiced red cabbage , and  two   terrines  -- that were all, if I remember correctly, consumed with unequivocal pleasure.    It's just that, now that I've had a taste of  filet mignon de porc  -- for such is the French name for it* -- I wonder what took me so long: it is truly the most succulent, the most flavorsome cut of pork I've ever dealt with.    If you're at all excited about  the butcher's craft , you may be interested to learn that the pork  filet mignon  (tenderloin) is a long muscle located on either side of the lower end of the animal's spine (so each pork yields two), underneath the  filet  (sirloin) and the  pointe de filet  (the tail end of the sirloin). (And lest you assume I've become an overnight expert in butchery, let me note that my life changed when I acquired a  Larousse gastronomique  and laid eyes on its crystal-clear meat diagrams.)    The tenderloin is lean, and  remarkably tender , so it is a choice cut that comes at a higher price than most: my organic butcher charges 19.50€/kg ($12/pound) for it, but it is net weight with no waste, i.e. no fat, bone, or gristle to remove.    Pork does well with sweet and tangy flavors, so I opted for a simple  marinade  of orange juice, honey, and rosemary, which, reduced and creamed up while the tenderloin was roasting in the oven, made for the perfect sauce to ladle over the butter-tender slices of meat.    ~~~    * In French butchery, the term  filet mignon  is used not only for  beef , but also for veal, venison, and pork. It refers to the same muscle in all cases, insofar as muscular similarities can be found in these different animals.                   Orange and Rosemary Pork Tenderloin    - 800 grams (1 pound 12 ounces)  pork tenderloin  ( filet mignon  in French), preferably organic   For the marinade:  - the juice of two  oranges  - 2 tablespoons  olive oil  - 1 tablespoon  white wine vinegar  - 1 rounded teaspoon  honey  - 2 cloves  garlic , finely chopped  - 1 teaspoon dried  rosemary  - 1/4 teaspoon fine  sea salt  - freshly ground  black pepper   For finishing:  - 1 rounded tablespoon  crme frache , or heavy cream  -  fleur de sel  - a handful flat-leaf  parsley , coarsely snipped    Serves 4.    Cut the tenderloin in 3 or 4 equal portions and place them in a nonreactive (glass or ceramic) baking dish large enough to accomodate them in a single layer.    Whisk together the marinade ingredients and pour them over the meat. Cover and refrigerate for at least an hour, and up to 4 hours, flipping the pieces of meat regularly so they'll marinate evenly.    Remove the dish from the fridge and preheat the oven to 180C (360F). Pour most of the marinade into a small saucepan, and leave about a tablespoon in the dish.     Put the dish (uncovered) in the oven and roast for 25 minutes, until cooked through but not dried out (the meat should be pale pink in the center; if using a meat thermometer, the recommended safe internal temperature is 70C or 160F), flipping the meat a couple of times during the roasting and basting it with its juices. Switch to grill and cook for 5 more minutes, until golden and slightly crusty at the top.    While the meat is roasting, put the saucepan with the remaining marinade over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Keep boiling, uncovered, stirring regularly, until the marinade has reduced to a thick syrup and is about a quarter of its original volume. Remove from heat, add in the cream, stir, and keep warm.    When the meat is ready, remove the dish from the oven, and transfer the meat to a cutting board. Add the marinade and cream mixture to the dish and stir to combine with the cooking juices. Cut the meat pieces into thickish slices, return to the dish, and sprinkle with fleur de sel and parsley. Bring the dish to the table and serve immediately, with boiled or mashed potatoes, and/or sauted carrots.        Never miss a recipe!

The meat stays juicy and develops a wonderful smoky flavor.    Sometimes I use the tenderloin to make cutlets. Cut think slices and then pound to an even thinness (is that a word??). I find it much more succulent and tender than the usual center cut pork cutlets.                         Posted by  Adele  on October  7, 2008  3:59 PM                                    I never heard the term ""filet mignon"" when I lived in France. Did not even know it was used in French - always thought it American Frenglish!    That said, pork tenderloin is a luxury cut indeed. It's also lovely on the grill. (and it makes incredible sandwiches should you have any left overs: layer a good homemade country bread with basil mayonnaise, roasted pepper, fresh mozzarella, some watercress and slices of cold tenderloin). Miam miam!                         Posted by  Sylvie, Rappahannock Cook & Kitchen Gardener  on October  7, 2008  4:02 PM                                    I got tickled because we're having pork tenderloin tonight!  The butcher's had a special of $2.99 a pound, so we'll be eating alot of it over the next couple of months.    I generally grill it and then make a sauce.  Tonight, I'm serving it with an orange-dijon-rosemary pan sauce, red bliss potatoes, and green beans.  The leftovers will be served tomorrow with a pineapple salsa (pineapple, jalapeno, red bell pepper and red onion), cous cous, and a salad.    I also make an Al Pastor type taco by dicing the pork and mixing it with achiote and pineapple.  It's also an excellent way to spice up leftovers.    Now I'm hungry!                         Posted by  liz  on October  7, 2008  4:13 PM                                    Yes, pork tenderloin is a wonderful, ever-delicious, super-quick treat. My mom makes a mustard rubbed one often for dinner parties, let me see if I can find the recipe (which is FANTASTIC and so easy)....    Yes!  I posted it  ages ago--excuse the mediocre old photos. I have probably eaten this recipe 25+ times (though I've only made it once; pork tenderloin is not cheap!) and every single time I think ""God, this is good.""                         Posted by  Kate F  on October  7, 2008  4:19 PM                                    We love pork tenderloin!  Your marinade looks wonderful.  I cut up marinated pork tenderloin and thread it on kabobs and grill it.  It's a great, lean meat.                         Posted by  the italian dish  on October  7, 2008  4:24 PM                                    Pork Tenderloin is excellent with cherry sauces as well.                         Posted by  JDC  on October  7, 2008  4:24 PM                                    In the words of a great movie, I have always found the pork tenderloin to be a nice sweet meat!                         Posted by  Alisa  on October  7, 2008  4:58 PM                                    Yes yes yes! It's the only cut of pork I buy!    If you'd like to try something delicious, I'd recommend rubbing it with  Massa de Pimento  - Portuguese red pepper paste, which I'm sure it'll be available somewhere in Paris! One of our most loved traditional dishes involves cutting it into cubes, marinating it in Pimento, white wine and garlic, and then cooking it with clams. It's fabulous!                           Posted by  Vanda  on October  7, 2008  4:58 PM                                    I love pork tenderloin and your recipe sounds great. My favorite way to prepare it is stuffed with dried fruits and couscous, then basted with a honey mixture. I haven't had pork tenderloin in a long time, I think I'll have to remedy that and prepeare your recipe.                          Posted by  Erin  on October  7, 2008  5:06 PM                                    We have a very similar pork tenderloin marinade that uses orange juice and cumin. And yes, we have been eating it with glee for years.                         Posted by  Laura  on October  7, 2008  5:17 PM                                    Sounds so easy! I've always loved pork tenderloin. I don't know why I don't cook it more. I am definitely trying this recipe.                          Posted by  Heather Miller  on October  7, 2008  6:07 PM                                    It's good that you have discovered pork tenderloin.  As you've stated, it's a terrific cut of meat.  For the past several years, I've cooked pork tenderloin for Thanksgiving dinner, instead of turkey, and it's always been a big hit.  I usually brine it for about 12 hours with sweet spices (cloves, cinnamon, anise, etc), then rub it up with olive oil and salt and roast it at high heat.  Yum yum.                         Posted by  Bradford Daly  on October  7, 2008  6:43 PM                                    One of my favorite pork tenderloin marinades is lime juice, cumin and coriander, with slices of garlic tucked into the roast.  Mmmmm!                         Posted by  Cat  on October  7, 2008  9:17 PM                                    :) coincidence: I made a batch of your oven ratatouille yesterday, and have the pork tenderloin waiting in my fridge to go with it (a bit pork-provenale). Will try out this version as well! It is my favourite cut, I found the other pork cuts easily to ruin (dried out chewy lumps in my case...)                         Posted by  Kim  on October  7, 2008 10:13 PM                                    Yes, I love pork with sweet flavors too!  I think that one of most memorable meals I have ever had was medallions of pork tenderloin with caramelized figs...                         Posted by  JessicaM  on October  7, 2008 10:20 PM                                    Ah...welcome to an amazing cut of meat!!!!  I find that marinading overnight and cooking whole, then slicing for presentation works better.  I follow Harold McGee's suggestion....Intense dry (fry) heat to caramelise the surface, then into a medium oven to cook within (with a meat thermometer to check for doneness).  And as for marinades... they all work..pick one each of sweet/salt/sour and spice.  Bon appetit                         Posted by  Artusi  on October  8, 2008 12:20 AM                                    I love pork tenderloin.  In fact w had it last night for dinner.  It is one of my favorite things to cook, so easy and you can do so many different things.  I will have to try your recipe next time.                         Posted by  Judy  on October  8, 2008  1:15 AM                                    That same piece of muscle also exists in a sheep and in a person. In fact in any animal that has a spine. It's the bit you always aim for in a spit-roasted whole sheep (it's the little bit on the smaller side of a mid-loin chop - too small to for butchers to sell by itself), and it's the bit in your back that hurts when you do sit-ups wrong (i.e. using your back rather than your stomach muscles).                          Posted by  Bronwyn  on October  8, 2008  3:52 AM                                    We love pork tenderloin in our house! I find it on sale every couple of months and I stock my freezer. We  are only three, so I trim the ends for a stir-fry or pasta, and marinate the rest (usually ginger, garlic, olive oil, soy, bit of honey, sometimes lime...) and I grill or roast, depending on weather and/or oven space. My five year old prefers vegetables, but does enjoy ""soft meat"", and this fits the bill. It's quick and delicious, and considering the fact that ALL of it is consumed, it's not too expensive. It's a regular feature in out home.                         Posted by  jennifer  on October  8, 2008  5:31 AM                                    Mmm. Pork tenderloin, the only cut of meat that  I feel confident about cooking. Cannot wait to try your recipe. Also, I'm watching Andrew Zimmern's show on TV and there you are talking about cheese!                          Posted by  Amy  on October  8, 2008  7:33 AM                                     I adore pork tenderloin as well and have used it for years as a fast and tasty meat done on my grill. My favorite marinade is with soy sauce, oil, minced garlic and minced ginger. You can also add a little honey if you like it sweet.                         Posted by  Linda  on October  8, 2008  8:27 AM                                    Pork tenderloin is delicious! Glad you've discovered it. One of my favourite marinades is maple syrup, soy sauce, fresh garlic and fresh ginger. Marinate for 30 minutes or so in a glass or ceramic dish. Sear the meat in a frying pan first, return to dish, then bake the whole thing, marinade and all, in the oven at 350F for 25 minutes or until cooked through. Use the cooked marinade to spoon over the meat. Delish!                         Posted by  margaux  on October  8, 2008  5:10 PM                                    My family loves pork tenderloin.  It is the only cut of meat that I can't screw up on.  My kids, 9,7, and 3 gobble it up.  I need to make more than one so my husband and I can have some!  Some times I sear it with salt and pepper and finish it in oven and sometimes I marinate it!  Oh by the way I saw you on Bizzare Foods with Andrew Zimmeran last night!  I would love to go to Paris some day.  It would be a dream vacation!                         Posted by  sara  on October  8, 2008  9:16 PM                                    I make pork pork tenderloin regularly, as its well-priced, very flexible, and a crowd-pleaser.    Last night for dinner I tried the orange and rosemary marinade. Delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, except did not add cream to the reduced marinade.  bon app!                         Posted by  la Reine  on October  8, 2008  9:19 PM                                    My absolute favourite cut of meat.    I usually marinate it in a mixture of hoisin sauce, honey, garlic,and green onions, sear it on high heat and then finish in the oven, until just pink in the middle. So good!                         Posted by  Danielle  on October  8, 2008  9:19 PM                                    I do a very similar pork tenderloin, but in my recipe instead of white wine vinegar and orange juice I'd use Dijon mustard and lemon juice/zest.                           Posted by  Michael  on October  8, 2008 10:20 PM                                    Yes, I love pork tenderloin also.  One of my favorite preparations is a chili powder dry rub and then grilled.  So many possibilities with this cut of pork.                         Posted by  Eileen  on October  8, 2008 10:21 PM                                    Can't agree no more that pork tenderloin is such a delicious and versatile meat to cook with. I've tried to make Chimichurri to grill my tenderloin.    Your marinade looks yummy. I gotta try it next time.                         Posted by  lululu  on October  8, 2008 10:24 PM                                    We love pork tenderloin! It is great for stir fry--just slice to apropriate thickness and viola! Also, in the USA Midwest, we have pork tenderloin sandwiches. Slice loin into 2 - 3"" sections and pound flat between 2 pieces of plastic wrap. Dip in beaten egg, dredge lightly in flour, and drop into hot vegetable oil. It cooks quickly and turns a lovely golden brown. Garnish with catsup and sweet pickle relish or serve it ""royal"" with mayo and lettuce and tomatoes. Midwesterners eat it on a soft hamburger roll, but just pick up your fork... There was never a better ""tenderloin"" than was served at Hunts in Peoria, IL.                         Posted by  Marielle  on October  8, 2008 11:55 PM                                    I didn't realize I was harbouring such a secret, but yes, we really are sighing ecstatically at my house,frequently.  My favourite recipe is pan-seared with a pomegranate sauce. I rarely make a recipe twice - there are just so many new ones to try - but this one I have made several times and just thinking about it makes we want it again....                         Posted by  Laurel  on October  9, 2008 12:03 AM                                    I have 3 pork loins--2 in the freezer and one I bought last week for $1.99 lb.  They are about 4 - 5 lb each.  I will cook one from the freezer and replace it with the fresh one I bought and it will be cut in half first.       Cooking for 1 is not always easy, but this cut of meat is easy to use for several meals in various ways.                              Posted by  Marcia   on October  9, 2008  1:48 AM                                    Pork tenderloin is a wonderful cut of meat, isn't it? And this sounds like a perfect recipe for bringing out its flavor and tenderness. One of my own favorite uses of pork tenderloin is a quickly cooked, pan-seared dish,  Pork Medallions with Tarragon Mustard Sauce .                         Posted by  Terry B  on October  9, 2008  3:30 AM                                    I took a cooking class recently, which featured pork tenderloin.  The chef told us that this cut was a blank canvas waiting for the artist palette!    This is proven by reading through the unique and varied cooking methods listed in this string.                          Posted by  Tom   on October  9, 2008  3:42 AM                                    A friend of mine in Italy introduced me to a wonderful classic French dish of pork tenderloin with prunes in a cream and wine sauce......mmmmmm.  I tracked it down in a cookbook here in Canada and it's sooo simple to make.                         Posted by  simone  on October  9, 2008  3:57 AM                                    According to Wikipedia, the accepted safe temp for pork has been reduced to 62.2 degrees - that may help the dryness issues.  One good thing to do with pork is to take a cutlet and crumb it (with maybe some herbs and grated parmesan) - or else coat in dukkah. Pan fry one side till golden, flip, then put the pan in a moderate oven for 10 minutes. Yum.

Posted by  Andr Sala  on October 10, 2008  4:04 PM                                    This is a classic and almost always available at Trader Joe's (here in SF Bay Area).  We use a marinade with pomegranate molasses, dijon mustard, and garlic!  Thanks.                         Posted by  sifi  on October 16, 2008 10:12 PM                                    I am definitely going to try making this for the soon to be wife. Maybe I can convince her that pork is not always hopelessly chewy.                         Posted by  Dan Alcantara  on October 17, 2008  5:58 AM                                    A tad overdone for my taste, should have known better and stick to my usual 20 mins. Still, the cut does stand the overcooking better than others and the marinade was excellent.                         Posted by  mara  on October 18, 2008  9:50 PM                                    I made this last night for supper.  It was fabulous!  Thank you!                         Posted by  Melissa  on October 24, 2008  3:07 PM                                    I like to slice the tenderloin into medallions and pound it a little bit, then brine it for about 20 minutes (1/4 C kosher salt and 1/4 C brown sugar per liter of water).  A quick saute and then any of many sauces -- just a pan sauce deglazed with a little white wine and a currant jelly, or marmalade.  Or saute some minced shallots in the pan, add a plum puree and season.  Or a honey-mustard cream pan sauce.  For something crispier, dredge the cutlets in egg and panko, then pan-fry and serve with mushroom and bacon gravy.  So many options, could eat pork tenderloin every day!                         Posted by  shelly  on November  1, 2008 10:08 PM                                    I have been cooking pork tenderloin for more years than i care to count & i respectfully submit that your internal temp of 160 is a tad high.   Although trichina is virtually nonexistent in pork, if it were present, it would be killed at 137 degrees F. Although trichina is virtually nonexistent in pork, if it were present, it would be killed at 137 degrees F. I generally prefer my pork cooked to approx 145. As it rests, it will rise approx 5-8 degrees. Think you might appreciate the flavor of the meat a bit more at this temp.    Love your site ! It's great fun .

Lutz  on November  3, 2008  5:10 PM                                    Patricia - Thanks for chiming in about the temperature -- I don't have a meat thermometer (I just play it by ear), and was merely reprinting the safety recommendations of the health authorities, but of course their concern is not flavor!

Just wanted to let you know I made this tenderloin recipe and it was a big hit with my family - even my picky 9-year-old gobbled it up!  I posted about it on my blog yesterday and look forward to making it again.  Thanks for your great recipes.                         Posted by  Janice  on November  4, 2008  3:15 PM                                    I don't cook meat a lot (besides fish) b/c it intimidates me, but I followed this simple recipe and really loved the results.  So tender was the p.t.l, I cut it with the side of my fork.  I will do this again with a fancier side dish if we have company.  Wouldn't it be good with a steamed artichoke???

Lightly coat a baking dish with cooking spray.    In a heavy frying pan, add the sesame seeds in a single layer. Over low heat, cook the seeds stirring constantly until they look golden and give off a noticeably toasty aroma, about 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the seeds from the pan to cool.    In a bowl, add the coriander, cayenne pepper, celery seed, minced onion, cumin, cinnamon, sesame oil and toasted sesame seeds. Stir to mix evenly.    Place the pork tenderloin in the prepared baking dish. Rub the spices on both sides of the pork pieces. Bake until no longer pink, about 15 minutes. Or bake until a meat thermometer reaches 160 degrees (medium) or 170 degrees (well-done).    Transfer the pork tenderloin to warmed plates. Serve immediately.

My figs are planted in pots because it's too cold and windy in this part of the world for the trees to survive the winter. Instead, in late fall, they are wrapped in burlap and placed in a dark, unheated barn.  This provides a safe environment, allowing the plants to spend the necessary dormant period so that they are energized to produce fruit again next spring. Please continue reading for more interesting facts about figs and to check out more pictures.                       One of the many joys of the late-summer harvest is biting into a sweet, juicy, plump fig. The fig is not a true fruit in the botanical sense of the word, but a fleshy receptacle housing thousands of tiny fruits.  The fig has tremendous nutritional and medicinal properties and has been prized since ancient times.      First cultivated 5,000 years ago in the Middle East, fresh figs are an excellent source of potassium and fiber and, when dried, these nutritional elements are even more concentrated. In fact, dried figs are so sweet that they were used as a sweetening agent long before sugar was introduced to the world. The stems and leaves of the fig tree contain a milky, coagulating substance that is said to rid the skin of wrinkles and calluses. In ancient Greece, fig-tree branches were used to stir cheese, accelerating the coagulation process.     If you're fortunate enough to have a fig tree, be sure to wait until the figs are ripe before picking them.  They will not ripen once they're picked. Figs are highly perishable and need to be eaten quickly. A perfectly ripe fig is a fabulous dessert by itself, but figs marry well with countless other flavors, from sweet to savory and raw to cooked.       This beautiful braided fig tree is an Italian purple-red. I really love the taste of the fruit.       Look at this plate of Italian purple-reds! So gorgeous and delicious!          This fig is actually a cutting from a tree that my father grew in his well-protected garden in Nutley, New Jersey.          It's a common variety that produces a light-green fig. When you take a bite, the inside is a gorgeous pink.    Still life with Vivaldi.

I mean, I've seen them around and all but have never tasted one.  You make them sound delicious!

Posted by:    Kristin Crowder |     August 26, 2008 at 12:25 AM                          Hi Martha, I don't remember when I first saw a fig tree, but I do remember being surprised that the small green fig was responsible for the delicious filling in fig bars. My neighbor has one like yours that is a cutting from your father's tree. It's beautiful like yours and it makes it through the winter here near Seattle without being wrapped. I love your photos. Vivaldi looks beautiful in that last photo. Thanks again for sharing. We had another fierce thunder storm again this evening, but nothing bad resulted from it. Thank goodness.

Why have I read before that the milky white substance in the stems and leaves that M talks about, is poisonous? Does anyone know if that is true?  It is interesting how the Greeks used it/the stems to make cheese. Wonder if it acts like rennet.             Posted by:    maurdel |     August 26, 2008 at 12:48 AM                          This is great idea to plant them in pots. In my area they can not survive winter as well. I feel like planting it and overwintering it.  /Ewa             Posted by:     Ewa  |     August 26, 2008 at 12:58 AM                          I am fascinated that you can grow figs so far north!  The one thing I miss most about my Louisiana garden is the fig trees.  They ripen in mid-July though and I never learned the variety.  Still they made wonderful preserves and I loved walking through the garden early in the morning and picking them fresh for my breakfast.    I am curious though about what varieties I might try to grow in pots.  They see so tiny compared to the ones in my old garden, but any ripe fig at all is well worth the effort!  Might you do an article on the subject or perhaps just expand upon this blog?             Posted by:    Sherrry |     August 26, 2008 at 01:14 AM                          Martha,    You are lucky.  Each year, neighborhood kids and birds beat us to the figs on our fig tree.    I agree.  You have never tasted heaven until you bite into a delicious fig.  My mother made a wonderful fig preserve each year with orange and lemon rinds.  Unfortunately, I did not gain her canning skills.  One day I will try though.     Thanks for bringing back the memories.    Sonia             Posted by:    Sonia F. |     August 26, 2008 at 01:45 AM                          Dear Martha!  The figs looks delicious. Would love to share with a recipe that I am sure you will love.  Love you Martha.  God Bless  Rowaida Flayhan  Fig Jam  This is an Authentic Lebanese Recipe   2 Ibs. dried figs  3 cups sugar  3 cups water  1 Tbsp. lemon juice  1 1/2 Tbsp. roasted sesame seeds  1/4 tsp. powdered mustikah (gum arable)  1/4 cup pine kernels  1/2 to 1 cup walnuts    This delicious and nourishing jam will keep for several months, unsealed, in a cool place. The figs are preserved in the fall when the fruit is in its prime and the jam is relished by Lebanese villagers as a spread for bread, as a pudding or just as a sweet.    Cut the dried figs in small pieces. Dissolve sugar in water and bring to a full boil. Skim off the foam. Add lemon juice. Place figs in the syrup and boil together on a medium flame. Gradually increase the flame, stirring mixture constantly to avoid burning. Add walnuts, pine nuts, sesame seeds and cook on low fire for five minutes stirring constantly. Remove from fire. Stir in mustikah. Pour into jars. Decorate tops with walnut halves which have been lightly toasted.                   Posted by:    Rowaida Flayhan |     August 26, 2008 at 02:15 AM                          I was only recently able to get fresh figs to try... I'd only eaten dried before. It was a wonderful experience... I baked them with orange juice and freshly grated ginger, and served them with whipped marscapone cheese. My family LOVED them! Thanks so much for sharing about your fig trees... especially how to winter them. I hope I someday have the space and means to try these sorts of things.             Posted by:     RamonaZF  |     August 26, 2008 at 02:17 AM                          I GREW UP EATING FIGS AND PLAYING IN THE TREES. I'M SAD TO SAY I DON'T CARE FOR THEM ANY LONGER, YET I LOVE THE LOOK OF THE FRUIT AND TO CUT THEM OPEN IS A JOY AND TO SEE THE BEAUTIFUL COLOR MOTHER NATURE HAS GIVEN THIS ""YUCKY"" FRUIT.   THE TREES ARE THE BEST TO CLIMB FOR CHILDREN OF ALL AGES...  ENJOY THE SEASON  L.             Posted by:    l kincaid |     August 26, 2008 at 02:31 AM                          We have a fig bush in our yard. In North Carolina the winters are fairly mild & the bush is very hardy. I didn't know it but we must have the ""Italian"" version because the fruit turns reddish/purple. This particular fig tree has been in this yard a very long time because my now deceased grandmother planted it.

Now nobody wants to have them anymore!  One of my neighbors has one, and I might ask if I can mooch a few. . .             Posted by:    Amy in Houston |     August 26, 2008 at 06:07 AM                          I'm glad to see this blog entry about figs! I planted a tree outdoors (NY) last spring (2007) for the look, not the fruit, not being well-acquainted myself with figs. It survived the winter because, I guess, it realized it was on its own. The location gets lots of sun, but also is fully exposed to the elements.  This winter I would like to take better precaution. It's grown too big now to put in a pot and bring indoors, so what is the proper procedure for overwintering it outside? What to do, and when?   Also, mine is a green fig... when are the figs ready to eat, what should I look for? The tree has lots of fruit.   Thanks.             Posted by:    diane Leib |     August 26, 2008 at 06:51 AM                          Martha,   I think that is so neat that you have a memory of your dad growing in your garden.      I have a Bay Leaf plant in my kitchen that was started from a plant my mom has at her house.  I keep it in doors so its protected.  I'm hoping to have it a long time.              Posted by:    Ann |     August 26, 2008 at 07:07 AM                          very cool, Martha..   our fig tree, zone 8, does great year after year.    You're so right about waiting to pick, I've learned that lesson;-)  can we say pucker up please..             Posted by:    Judy C |     August 26, 2008 at 07:10 AM                          Good to know that figs work well in pot culture.  We're about the same zone as Bedford, so we may need to give this a try.             Posted by:     Phyllis  |     August 26, 2008 at 07:45 AM                          It was nice to see your figs! I just made fig preserves myself using the popular Brown Turkey figs of the south harvested from my husband's grandmother's trees. So sweet and nutritious!               Posted by:    kelli |     August 26, 2008 at 07:52 AM                          I just love the look of the braided trunk! As if the delicious taste of figs isn't enough to jump start some inpiration, the color of the fruit is stunning and the leaves are equally beautiful!    Thanks Martha!

They were the best things I have ever eaten.  We treated them as if they were fine cargo.             Posted by:    Jay |     August 26, 2008 at 08:19 AM                          Hi,  I live way in south Georgia and we have had fig trees around our farm for as long as I can remember...  One of the best (and longest lasting) treats we had besides eating the plump, delicious fruit off of the trees was my grandmother's homemade fig preserves.  She would use a very unusual ingredient- strawberry jello to make the most delicious preserves that we cherished throughout the year.    She is now in a nursing home and is suffering very bad health. I am hoping to find her recipe in her drawers and books of many and re-create this wonderful memory.             Posted by:    Jenny |     August 26, 2008 at 08:29 AM                          Hi Martha:  I love figs too.  My mother lived next door to an italian immigrant who just adored gardening in his teeny tiny little backyard.  He crammed so much vegetables, fruit, and flowers that it was a beautiful harvest every year.  In that tiny space was a HUGE towering fig tree which he pruned every year.  Tons of glorious figs were available and shared with my family every year.  He gave my mother a cutting from that fig tree which she planted and for many years it thrived and produced lots of figs.  I love figs.  That fig tree no longer exists anymore, but I remember it well.

For those of you who read my posts, you can figure out that I'm fond of cats!  =^..^=)    I'm not particularly fond of figs (the seeds!), nor can I say that I've eaten one whole (taken a bite out of the flesh).  Yours, Martha, are beautiful, though, and when I saw your subject for today, I thought ""how in the world is she growing figs""?!!, but justified it in my mind with your reliance on your trusted greenhouses. I'm a little south of you, in Western Maryland, and would consider it lucky to even have success over-wintering this genus.    I l-o-v-e that you have your special fig tree from childhood - what tremendous sentimental value!  It appears to be thriving successfully.    Summer (in spite of the heat and humidity) is starting to slip on by.    Big sigh!    =^..^=             Posted by:    Cindy Bricker |     August 26, 2008 at 09:53 AM                          hi, i am Zeinab from Egypt farawat country , and that tree planted in our country ( Marsa Matrouh ) Roumeil Museume her at my country and we are near Alexandria city, and i was so glad to see that fruit in your site , bye             Posted by:    Zeinab |     August 26, 2008 at 10:07 AM                          Figs are my ultimate favorite fruit...

I am drooling looking at your beautiful photos. Vivaldi looks so handsome sitting next to your prize fruit!  How wonderful you have a tree from your Dad's fig tree. That has to be very special indeed!  Where do you buy your specimens from? I live in CT and would love a tree. I don't have a barn but can you place one in your garage for winterizing?  Enjoy your delicious harvest!

In a medium size pot, heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil and add chopped garlic and sliced onions.  Cut eggplant into 1/2 inch cubes, salt and let drain on some paper towel. Once they've sweated a bit add to garlic and onions.  Halve the zucchinis lengthwise and cut into slices then add to pot. Let this mixture cook down a bit.  Chop tomatoes and add with the chipotle and cardomon seeds. Cook out for about an hour and don't forget to add salt and pepper to your taste.    The Pork.    In a hot skillet with some olive oil, sear tenderloin evenly on all sides. Remove from skillet and let cool a minute. Grind spices but not too finely. You want them coarse. Coat pork tenderloin with a little oil, season with salt and pepper and  sprinkle the spice mix over it. Gently press spice mix into tenderloin.  Place in ovenproof dish and roast at 380F for about 20 minutes. Let rest and carve.

Sweet-and-Spicy Pork Tenderloin                                     Chef Devin Alexander                                              Publication Date: 04/21/2008                                                             Devin Alexander, the host of   Healthy Decadence  on the Discovery Network, is the author of   The Biggest Loser Cookbook, Fast Food Fix  and the just released   The Most Decadent Diet Ever .       This chef and former L.A. caterer has maintained a 55-pound weight loss for over 15 years by transforming our favorite (and mostly fattening) dishes such as BBQ Bacon Cheeseburgers, Eggplant Parmesan, Fried Jumbo Shrimp, and more into guilt-free yet mouth-watering indulgences that anyone can make.        Sweet-and-Spicy Pork Tenderloin     When people hear that Im a healthy chef, they often assume Im a vegetarian, which, to anyone who knows me, is a ridiculous notion. I love meatall kinds reallyand this pork roast is of my favorites. When cooked right, the pork is as tender as can be.         Ingredients:    1/2 teaspoon ground cumin   1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon   1/2 teaspoon salt   1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper   1/4 teaspoon ground allspice   1/8 teaspoon garlic powder   1/8 teaspoon ground chipotle chile pepper   1 pork tenderloin   (1 pounds), trimmed of visible fat   1 teaspoon extra-virgin   olive oil   2 tablespoons honey   1 tablespoon minced garlic   1 teaspoons hot-pepper sauce      1. Preheat the oven to 350F. Lightly mist a small roasting pan or ovenproof skillet with olive oil spray. Set aside.   2. In a small bowl, combine the cumin, cinnamon, salt, black pepper, allspice, garlic powder, and chipotle pepper. Rub the pork evenly with the olive oil. Then rub evenly with the spice mixture until coated. Cover loosely with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 15 minutes.   3. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine the honey, garlic, and hot-pepper sauce. Whisk to mix. Set aside.   4. Set a large, nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until it is hot enough for a spritz of water to sizzle on it. With an oven mitt, briefly remove the pan from the heat to lightly mist with olive oil spray. Place the pork in the pan. Cook for 1 minute per side, or until browned on all sides. Transfer to the prepared pan. With a basting brush, evenly coat the pork with the reserved honey mixture.   5. Roast the tenderloin in the oven for 16 to 18 minutes, or until a thermometer inserted in the center reaches 160F and the juices run clear. Remove from the oven. Cover the pork loosely with aluminum foil. Let stand for 10 minutes. Transfer the pork to a cutting board. Holding a knife at a 45 angle, cut into thin slices. Serve immediately.

The fruit grows on a tall creeper, similar to a vine, and has brown, fuzzy skin and a bright green interior. The fruit is sweeter near its white center and small black edible seeds.        Varieties    Although there are approximately ten varieties of kiwi fruit, the ones found in the market are generally the large, egg-sized, sweet, green kiwi. However, a less common gold kiwi is also available. Sweeter and a little smaller than the green kiwi, the gold kiwi can be identified by its bronze skin and its bright yellow fruit inside.        Buying and storing tips    Choose semi-firm, unblemished fruit with uniform skin. Kiwis sweeten with age but should be consumed before they become mushy; they will ferment if left too long. Refrigerate when soft.        Availability    Kiwis are available April through December, peaking June to October.        Preparation, uses, and tips    Once the fuzzy peel is removed, the entire fruit can be eaten. Slice the fruit to make beautiful garnishes on cakes, cocktails,  cheese  plates, or breakfast  cereals . For a delicious,  vitamin C –packed treat, cut the fruit into chunks, mix with  strawberries  and  orange  pieces, let sit for an hour to blend juices, stir, and serve. Cooking kiwi fruit is not recommended, although they can be blended into sauces or soups.

Food allergies identified in these cases included kiwi fruit. No research has investigated the possible role of food allergy in other causes of pancreatic insufficiency.

The fig’s intense sweetness is yet another pleasure. But it’s all those seeds—there can be as many as 750—that explain a fig’s curious biology.   Each seed comes from an individual blossom hidden within the fig itself. These unseen flowers mature into seeds. And then, as the fig dries and its moisture wicks out, the seeds shrink into miniscule, pinpoint sized seeds that make satisfying pops as you bite into them.   Figs are one of humankind’s oldest cultivated crops and one of my favorite treats—either fresh or dried. When fresh, these elegantly shaped fruits are best eaten ripe off the tree. Once picked figs won’t get sweeter. But they quickly soften and this makes them highly perishable. As a consequence, about 90% of the world's fig harvest is sold dried.   Local fresh figs are now available in select area markets and the Grower’s Markets. Look for plump, soft but resilient fruits with sheen on their blossom end which indicates ripeness—and therefore more flavor and sugar. There are several varieties available—each with their own flavor characteristics, and each, utterly delicious if it was ripe when picked.   A common dried fig is the tan colored and slightly nutty-flavored calimyrna. Another is the sweeter and almost black mission fig. Dried figs should have an almost musky aroma and be slightly moist.   Of all common fruits, dried figs have the highest overall mineral content—they’re high in iron and ounce for ounce they’re higher in calcium than cow's milk. Figs have even more fiber than prunes. Because figs have edible seeds, they’re one of the few fruits that contain the valuable omega-3 and omega-6 essential fatty acids. Figs also contain from 4 to 50 times more bioflavonoid antioxidants than do other fruits.   Historically figs are renowned for building energy and for supporting digestive function and bowel regularity.   Purchase dried figs without sulfite or potassium sorbate preservatives. Pound for pound, preservative-free figs give you more fruit for your money because the preservatives enable the fruit to retain up to 30% more water.   Natural, additive-free figs are darker in color; because they contain less water, their flavor and nutrients are more concentrated and they’re chewier. All dried fruits are concentrated. Six pounds of fresh figs, for   example, yield one pound dried.   Store dried figs in an airtight container and at a low temperature. There are best used within a year of purchase. Sometimes a powdery bloom forms on dried figs; this is the fruit's natural sugar in a crystalline form and it is edible.   If, however, it’s a fresh fig that’s in your hand, eat it on the spot. But eat it slowly to fully savor its lush and varied textures. My favorite way to cook fresh figs is to cut them in half, splash with liqueur and then either grill or broil them just until their tops get bubbly and caramelize. Serve hot.

Figs were brought to  America  in the early 1500s. Several types were cultivated and used for preserves or fig paste.  California  ranks number two in the world for fig production.    ""Figs can serve as a delicious snack in the car or at the office, being a good source of fiber,"" Roy says, adding, ""Dried figs are popular, but you can also buy fresh figs, especially at farmers markets or small specialty grocery stores.""    The LSU AgCenter nutritionist notes that fig puree can be used as a sweetener or as a fat substitute in many recipes. You can make your own fig puree by combining 8 ounces of figs with 1/4 to 1/3 cup water in a blender. Figs can be part of any diet, since they are sodium, fat and cholesterol-free.    Figs add nutrients and minerals to your diet, without adding any fat. One-fourth cup of dried figs, or about three to five figs, provides about 5 grams of fiber (insoluble and soluble).    Roy says compared with other common fruits, figs have the highest content of minerals (potassium, iron), and their calcium content is second to oranges.    ""This doesnt mean, though, that you can eat as many figs as you want, because remember, they still add calories to your diet!"" Roy points out.    Did you know that figs are considered functional foods? Functional foods are those foods that have benefits beyond the basic nutrition and may prevent disease or promote health.    Dried figs contain omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which are essential amino acids. They also contain phytosterols, which inhibit the absorption of dietary cholesterol, thus decreasing the total levels of cholesterol. Figs also contain substances (benzaldehydes, coumarins) that may help prevent certain types of cancers.    Figs have a long shelf life, up to two years from the production date. They should be stored in a cool, dry place. Figs can be frozen, but, because of their high sugar content, they will not freeze solidly.    Roy offers additional ways to enjoy figs besides as a snack and add more fiber to your diet, too.      Add chopped figs to green salads for sweetness and texture.    Add figs instead of raisins to oatmeal, for variety.    Combine low-fat cream cheese with finely chopped figs and use as spread for bagels.

It has been cultivated for thousands of years, remnants of figs having been found in excavations of Neolithic sites traced to at least 5,000 B.C. As time went on, the fig-growing territory stretched from Afghanistan to southern Germany and the Canary Islands. Pliny was aware of 29 types. Figs were introduced into England some time between 1525 and 1548. It is not clear when the common fig entered China but by 1550 it was reliably reported to be in Chinese gardens. European types were taken to China, Japan, India, South Africa and Australia.                 Some people peel the skin back from the stem end to expose the flesh for eating out of-hand. The more fastidious eater holds the fruit by the stem end, cuts the fruit into quarters from the apex, spreads the sections apart and lifts the flesh from the skin with a knife blade, discarding the stem and skin. Commercially, figs are peeled by immersion for 1 minute in boiling lye water or a boiling solution of sodium bicarbonate. In warm, humid climates, figs are generally eaten fresh and raw without peeling, and they are often served with cream and sugar. Peeled or unpeeled, the fruits may be merely stewed or cooked in various ways, as in pies, puddings, cakes, bread or other bakery products, or added to ice cream mix.                                   Home owners preserve the whole fruits in sugar sirup or prepare them as jam, marmalade, or paste. Fig paste (with added wheat and corn flour, whey, sirup, oils and other ingredients) forms the filling for the well known bakery product, ""Fig Newton"". The fruits are sometimes candied whole commercially. In Europe; western Asia, northern Africa and California, commercial canning and drying of figs are industries of great importance.                   The Fig plays an important part in Latin mythology. It was dedicated to Bacchus and employed in religious ceremonies. The wolf that suckled Romulus and Remus rested under a Fig tree, which was therefore held sacred by the Romans, and Ovid states that among the celebrations of the first day of the year by Romans, Figs were offered as presents. The inhabitants of Cyrene crowned themselves with wreaths of Figs when sacrificing to Saturn, holding him to be the discoverer of the fruit. Pliny speaks also of the Wild Fig, which is mentioned also in Homer, and further classical references to the Fig are to be found in Theophrastus, Dioscorides, Varro and Columella.                     Processed figs are made into pies, pudding, cakes, other bakery products, jams, jellies and preserves. Fig paste is a mixture of figs, wheat and corn flour, whey, syrup, oils, and other ingredients                    Dietary value, per 100 gram edible portion:                   Dried Figs:                    Water (%) ........................................ 23    Calories ............................................ 274    Protein (%) ...................................... 4.3    Fat (%) ............................................. 1.3    Carbohydrates (%) ........................ 69    Crude Fiber (%) .............................. 5.8 (high for fruit)                    % of US RDA*                    Vitamin A ......................................... 1.6    Thiamin, B1 ...................................... 7.1    Riboflavin, B2 .................................. 6.2    Niacin ................................................ 3.9    Vitamic C .......................................... 0    Calcium ............................................. 15.8    Phosphorus ..................................... 9.6    Iron ................................................... 30    Sodium ............................................. 0.8    Potassium ........................................ 14                    In internal use, Fig have been used to fight constipation, bronchitis and because of its edible properties.

BENEFITS OF FIG                                      Figs are used for their mild, laxative action, and are employed in the preparation of laxative confections and syrups, usually with senna and carminatives. It is considered that the laxative property resides in the saccharine juice of the fresh fruit and in the dried fruit is probably due to the indigestible seeds and skin. The three preparations of Fig of the British Pharmacopoeia are  Syrup of Figs , a mild laxative, suitable for administration to children;  Aromatie Syrup of Figs, Elixir of Figs , or  Sweet Essence of Figs , an excellent laxative for children and delicate persons, is compounded of compound tincture of rhubarb, liquid extract of senna, compound spirit of orange, liquid extract of cascara and Syrup of Figs.  The Compound Syrup of Figs  is a stronger preparation, composed of liquid extract of senna, syrup of rhubarb and Syrup of Figs, and is more suitable for adults.                   The fruits are most commonly made into jams. According to the Plants for a Future database, the fully ripe fruits are sweet and mucilaginous. They can be eaten raw, cooked, pickled, or dried for later use. The leaves are edible also, but they are rated too mucilaginous to be enjoyable.                   Medicinal uses have included: nausea, headaches, fevers, toothache, blood tonic, gout, arthritis, digestive problems, constipation, nervousness, diarrhea, earache, fluid retention, whooping cough, asthma, burns, boils, abscesses, venereal diseases, stomach-ache and to benefit the pancreas, spleen and heart. A Cough Syrup is prepared by soaking chopped leaves in a little water, strained and sweetened with honey.                    The high mucilage content forms a healing and protective surface over sore throats. Pads, dried and powdered, are used as base material in vitamin preparations, and the powder is capsulated for treating hemorrhoids. American Indians made an ointment or salve from the plant for wounds, skin diseases and skin cancer.                    Use pads, sliced in half, as a poultice, on bites, rashes, abscesses, tumours and rheumatic joints; over the chest for respiratory conditions; over ears for earache; and over the liver region for liver ailments. In China, it is a tradition to treat numbness by eating the pads cooked with eggs; and prepared with pork in soup, to strengthen weak patients. In Mexico, pads are made into a liquid and applied to the scalp, to restore natural hair colour and as conditioner, for dry and itchy scalps.                                        It is also used in soap recipes. It is a folk remedy for lowering high cholesterol and excess weight and for treating diabetes.

The fig’s intense sweetness is yet another pleasure. But it’s all those seeds—there can be as many as 750—that explain a fig’s curious biology.   Each seed comes from an individual blossom hidden within the fig itself. These unseen flowers mature into seeds. And then, as the fig dries and its moisture wicks out, the seeds shrink into miniscule, pinpoint sized seeds that make satisfying pops as you bite into them.   Figs are one of humankind’s oldest cultivated crops and one of my favorite treats—either fresh or dried. When fresh, these elegantly shaped fruits are best eaten ripe off the tree. Once picked figs won’t get sweeter. But they quickly soften and this makes them highly perishable. As a consequence, about 90% of the world's fig harvest is sold dried.   Local fresh figs are now available in select area markets and the Grower’s Markets. Look for plump, soft but resilient fruits with sheen on their blossom end which indicates ripeness—and therefore more flavor and sugar. There are several varieties available—each with their own flavor characteristics, and each, utterly delicious if it was ripe when picked.   A common dried fig is the tan colored and slightly nutty-flavored calimyrna. Another is the sweeter and almost black mission fig. Dried figs should have an almost musky aroma and be slightly moist.   Of all common fruits, dried figs have the highest overall mineral content—they’re high in iron and ounce for ounce they’re higher in calcium than cow's milk. Figs have even more fiber than prunes. Because figs have edible seeds, they’re one of the few fruits that contain the valuable omega-3 and omega-6 essential fatty acids. Figs also contain from 4 to 50 times more bioflavonoid antioxidants than do other fruits.   Historically figs are renowned for building energy and for supporting digestive function and bowel regularity.   Purchase dried figs without sulfite or potassium sorbate preservatives. Pound for pound, preservative-free figs give you more fruit for your money because the preservatives enable the fruit to retain up to 30% more water.   Natural, additive-free figs are darker in color; because they contain less water, their flavor and nutrients are more concentrated and they’re chewier. All dried fruits are concentrated. Six pounds of fresh figs, for   example, yield one pound dried.   Store dried figs in an airtight container and at a low temperature. There are best used within a year of purchase. Sometimes a powdery bloom forms on dried figs; this is the fruit's natural sugar in a crystalline form and it is edible.   If, however, it’s a fresh fig that’s in your hand, eat it on the spot. But eat it slowly to fully savor its lush and varied textures. My favorite way to cook fresh figs is to cut them in half, splash with liqueur and then either grill or broil them just until their tops get bubbly and caramelize. Serve hot.

PUMPING UP YOUR IRON       Topics you will find:    Why do You Need Iron?    How Much Iron do You Need?   Why Do Babies Especially need More Iron?   Why do Women Need More Iron?   How Can I Tell if My Children or I are Low in Iron or Anemic?   3 Steps to Correct Your Child's Anemia   What Are the Best Food Sources of Iron?   8 Ways to Prevent Anemia   My Doctor Measured my Hemoglobin and it's Normal. Could I still be anemic?      Back to top   ""Why do you need iron?""   Iron is necessary to make hemoglobin, the substance that carries oxygen through your blood to  all the cells in your body.  Hemoglobin is what makes red blood cells red.  With insufficient iron,  and therefore not enough hemoglobin, red blood cells become small and pale and don't carry  enough oxygen. You may have heard the phrase ""tired blood."" This really means blood that is  low in iron and that can't carry enough oxygen to vital organs and muscles. ""Tired blood"" results  in a tired body.     Iron is needed not only for blood, but also for brains.  Neurotransmitters, the neurochemicals that  carry messages from one nerve to another, require sufficient iron to function properly.  A person  with an iron deficiency may have a tired mind as well as a tired body.      Back to top   ""How much iron do you need?""     Children and adults need different amounts of iron at different times in their lives.  Rapid growth  increases iron needs.  So does iron loss.  Here are some facts on iron needs at different ages and  stages.          HOW MUCH IRON YOU NEED EACH DAY*       Children, 1-10 years   10 mg.       Teen males   12 mg.       Adults males   10 mg.       Teen and adult females   18 mg.       Pregnant women   30 mg.        * Average RDA for iron         Babies store iron from their mother's blood while they are in the womb.  Babies born   prematurely need extra iron  because they do not have enough time in the womb to develop  sufficient iron stores.      Term babies  are born with a large reserve of iron, which should last at least six months. If  baby does not receive any extra dietary iron, these iron stores get used up.  This is why  formula-fed babies should receive an iron-fortified formula, beginning at birth or at least  within the first few months afterwards.  Human milk contains relatively small amounts of  iron, but it is very well absorbed.  So breastfed babies rarely need iron supplements.      Between six months and one year,  baby's mother-provided iron stores may run out.  For  this reason, your doctor may check your infant's hemoglobin levels around the nine and  twelve month checkup, especially if your doctor suspects anemia by baby's dietary history or  if baby appears pale.      Toddlers, ages one to three,  with their finicky eating habits, may also be prone to iron  deficiency anemia.      Preschoolers and school-age children, ages three to eleven,  are not likely to become iron  deficient for two reasons: they are not growing as rapidly as they did in infancy and they tend  to eat more iron-rich foods, such as hamburgers.    Adolescents  need more iron because they are going through a period of rapid growth,  increasing their need for all nutrients.     Teenage girls and women of child-bearing age  need approximately five milligrams a day  more of dietary iron than men because of blood loss through menstruation.      Pregnancy  increases the need for iron in order to adequately supply two growing bodies  with what they need.  Also, blood volume increases during pregnancy, calling for more iron.     Athletes  require increased amounts of iron to perform well during high endurance sports.   Athletes engaged in endurance training may become iron deficient due to increased  elimination of iron during prolonged vigorous exercise.      Vegans (strict vegetarians who eat no animal products)  may be at risk for iron deficiency,  since plant foods are a less efficient source of iron than animal foods.      Iron deficiency among meat eaters is unusual.   Most Americans eat too much meat.     Iron-deficiency anemia  may be a subtle, hidden cause of poor school performance, since  iron deficiency has been shown to be linked to reduced ability to concentrate, decreased  performance on school and intelligence tests, and a general overall decrease in academic and  work performance. When anemia is corrected, academic performance is improved.       Back to top   ""Why do babies especially need more iron?""   It is very important for growing infants to get enough iron in their diet.  Infants between one and  two years of age who have iron deficiency anemia have been found to have lower scores on  mental and motor functioning tests; their scores are also lower at five years of age.  The late  Frank Oski,   who was a professor at John Hopkins School of Medicine and  was one of the country's leading pediatric hematologists, summarized the importance of  preventing iron deficiency anemia: ""Three studies...have now suggested that iron deficiency  anemia   occurring at an apparently crucial time in infancy  results in irreparable cognitive damage.  Attention must be directed to prevention of iron  deficiency.  Breastfeeding followed by the use of iron-fortified formulas until one year can  achieve this desired goal.""          Back to top   ""Why do women need more iron?""     An active, menstruating woman should eat at least eighteen milligrams of iron daily. This is  easier advised than done.  A well-balanced diet supplies around six milligrams of iron for every  thousand calories. Yet, women usually eat about 2,000 calories, which amounts to around twelve  milligrams of iron a day.  Add to this diminished iron intake the fact that women eat more fruits  and vegetables (which contain poorly absorbed iron) and are generally not big meat eaters.  This  is why many women are anemic or borderline anemic without even knowing it.  It would be wise  for women to have not only a hemoglobin level done yearly, but also a serum ferritin test   to check their total iron stores.

If you suspect anemia, look for these signs:   Paleness (especially noticeable in the face and earlobes of infants and children; in the palms and  nail beds of adults)     Weakness  Fatigue  Shortness of breath  Irritability  Difficulty concentrating  Increased susceptibility to infections  Intolerance of cold temperatures  Constipation  Brittle, flat, thin fingernails      Back to top   THREE STEPS TO CORRECT YOUR CHILD'S ANEMIA    ""Borderline"" anemia can usually be corrected just by increasing your dietary supply of iron,  without taking iron supplements.  If your child is anemic, here's how to restock the iron deficient  body stores and elevate the hemoglobin level to normal:    Step 1:   Using diet to correct anemia in infants requires about one milligram of dietary iron  per pound per day.  So a twenty-pound infant would need a minimum of 20 milligrams of iron  per day, or about twice the usual RDA.  Depending on your infant's willingness to eat a lot of  iron-rich foods, it can be difficult to correct anemia with dietary measures alone.  The good news  is that the intestines compensate for iron deficiency by increasing the percentage of iron  absorbed from foods, and you can improve iron absorption by combining good iron sources with  vitamin C sources.  It usually requires even more dietary iron than the above amount to correct  anemia, but if your infant is only slightly anemic, it is worth trying the dietary increase for a  couple of weeks, and then having your doctor recheck baby's hemoglobin.      Step 2:   If dietary iron does not produce a significant improvement in your infant's hemoglobin  and/or serum ferritin, it would be wise to begin giving your child iron supplements in the form of  drops or pills in the dosage and timing recommended by your doctor.  The usual oral dose is two  milligrams per pound given three times a day between meals to enhance absorption.  The iron  syrup that is usually recommended for children is ferrous sulfate or ferrous succinate.  During the  first three weeks of treatment the hemoglobin increases at a rate of 0.15 to 0.25 grams per day, so  if your infant has a hemoglobin of nine and it should be eleven, expect it to take around three  weeks to reach this level.  In order to replenish the depleted iron stores, it's best to continue oral  iron supplements for at least two months after the hemoglobin becomes normal.     Step 3:  If your baby's hemoglobin is not increasing by at least one gram after two to four weeks  of treatment, your doctor may either want to increase the dosage of iron supplement or do some  further blood tests to determine if the anemia has other causes besides iron deficiency.        Back to top   8 WAYS TO PREVENT ANEMIA     Iron deficiency can cause anemia, a shortage of hemoglobin in the blood.  This can lead to  weakness, fatigue, a pale face and earlobes, and brittle, spoon-shaped nails.  There are other  causes of anemia besides nutritional deficiencies, including massive or chronic blood loss.     The best way to tell if you have enough iron in your body is to find out if you have enough iron  in your blood.   A ""finger-stick hemoglobin"" check   can be done in  your doctor's office.  This test requires only one tiny drop of blood, and the results are available  within a few minutes.  Pediatricians often use this test to check hemoglobin levels in nine-to  fifteen-month-old infants. Your doctor may check hemoglobin levels at other ages of increased  iron needs too, such as during female adolescence or pregnancy.  Normal hemoglobin values are:      infants and children 11 to 13 grams  women 12 to 16 grams   men 14 to 18 grams      You can prevent iron-deficiency anemia by making wise food choices for yourself and your  family.  Getting your daily iron from food is preferable to taking iron supplements, which  sometimes cause abdominal discomfort and constipation.  Here are some ways to assure there is  enough iron in your family's diet.      Breastfeed your baby as long as possible.     Once upon a  time it was believed that breastfed babies needed iron supplements because human milk was  low in iron. Yet, breastfed babies studied at four to six months of age had a higher  hemoglobin than infants who were fed iron-fortified formula.  Breastfed babies have been  found to have sufficient iron stores for nine months or longer.  Human milk remains an  important part of baby's diet, even after the introduction of solids.      Use an iron-fortified formula.     If  bottlefeeding, use an iron-fortified formula, preferably beginning at birth, but at least starting  by three months of age.  Continue iron-fortified formula for at least one year or as long as  your baby's doctor recommends, which is usually until your infant is eating adequate  amounts of other dietary sources of iron.  Do not use ""low-iron"" formulas, which do not  contain sufficient iron for a growing baby's needs.    Delay cow's milk feeding for infants; limit it for toddlers.     The Committee on Nutrition of the American Academy of Pediatrics  recommends that parents delay using cow's milk as a beverage until a baby is at least one  year of age.  There are two iron-related reasons for this:  cow's milk is low in iron, and  cow's milk can irritate the intestinal lining, causing bleeding and the loss of iron.  This is a  tiny amount of blood loss, but over a long period of time it can be significant.  The  combination of poor iron intake and increased iron loss sets a baby up for iron deficiency  anemia, and excessive milk consumption is a common cause of iron deficiency anemia in  toddlers.   An eighteen-month-old who consumes forty ounces of milk a day may be plump,  but is probably very pale.  Unless advised otherwise by your baby's doctor, limit your  toddler's cow milk intake to no more than 24 ounces a day.    Combine foods wisely.   Eating a food rich in vitamin C   along  with a good iron source will help your body use the iron.  Here are some classic examples:      spaghetti with meat and tomato sauce  meat and potatoes  chicken fajitas with broccoli, sweet pepper, and tomatoes  hamburger and coleslaw  nitrate-free hot dogs and orange juice  fruit, iron-fortified cereal, and raisins  fresh fruit with raisins        Try prune juice as a regular beverage.   Prune juice   is one of the few  juices that is high in iron (3 milligrams of iron per cup).  The process involved in making  prune juice retains more of the fruit's original nutrients than the juicing of other fruits.           NUTRITIP  Don't Skin the Iron  Leave the skin on the potatoes when making homemade fries.  This way you'll  get more nutrition into a french-fry-loving picky eater. The potato skin is rich  in nutrients and contains five times the amount of iron as the whole rest of the  potato.  Compliment those restaurants who have the nutritional wisdom to  leave the skins on the fries.  And, don't forget to eat the skin on your baked  potato.          Cook in iron pots.   The acid in foods seems to pull some of the iron out of the cast-iron  pots.  Simmering acidic foods, such as tomato sauce, in an iron pot can increase the iron  content of the brew more than ten-fold.  Cooking foods containing other acids, such as  vinegar, red wine, lemon or lime juice, in an iron pot can also increase the iron content of the  final mixture.    Bake with iron-rich grains.   The usual wheat  used to make bread and pastries is relatively  low in iron (around one milligram of iron per half cup).  Lesser known grains, such as  amaranth   (8 milligrams per half cup) and quinoa   (9  milligrams per half cup) are much richer in iron.  Barley   grains contain four  milligrams of iron per half cup.  Mixing these grains into the wheat flour you use when you  bake will increase the iron content of the finished product.       Back to top   Look out for misleading labels.      The percentage of iron listed on the package label is certainly not the amount of iron that gets into your  bloodstream.  This is especially true of iron-fortified cereals, in which only 4 to 10 percent of  the iron listed actually gets absorbed.  The amount of iron absorbed from any food depends  on the type of iron in the food, the body's need for iron, and the company of other foods  eaten at the same meal.       Back to top   ""My doctor measured my hemoglobin and it's normal. Could I still be anemic?""     A normal hemoglobin level does not necessarily indicate that you are not anemic, meaning your  blood is not low in iron.  Yet, the hemoglobin level obtained in your doctor's office does not  reflect total body stores of iron.  It's possible to have a normal hemoglobin, that is, a normal  amount of iron in the blood, yet have vital tissues throughout your body deficient in iron.  Some  people have symptoms of iron-deficiency anemia, even with a normal hemoglobin.  To really be  sure you have enough iron in your body, your doctor may send you to the laboratory to measure  the serum ferritin,   the level of iron in blood that accurately reflects iron  stores. (Normal values are 7 to 140 micrograms per liter (mcg/l) in children, 20 to 120  micrograms in women, 20 to 300 micrograms in men.)  If your serum ferritin level is normal, you  can rest assured that you have adequate iron stores throughout your body.     Serum ferritin levels detect iron deficiency in the early stages; a low hemoglobin reflects a much  later stage of iron deficiency.  This is an important consideration, since with a normal  hemoglobin and low ferritin levels the iron stores can be restocked by simply increasing the  amount of iron in your diet.  By the time the hemoglobin is low, iron supplements are usually  needed.  Symptoms of iron deficiency anemia, such as being tired, irritable, and having difficulty  concentrating, may be present long before anemia is reflected by the hemoglobin tests.  That is  why a serum ferritin is an earlier and more sensitive indicator of iron deficiency.                                                                                                                  Home        |  About Sears  |  Books  |        Newsletter  |  FAQs  |        Resources  |  News  |  Store        |  Contact Us  |  Site Map  |  Privacy Policy                                       AskDrSears.com is intended to help parents become better informed consumers         of health care.

BellyBytes.com  >  Food Facts  >  Kiwi Food Facts       Kiwi Food Facts                         The kiwifruit is native to the Yangtze River valley of northern China and Zhejiang Province on the coast of eastern China. The first seeds were brought out of China by missionaries to New Zealand at the turn of this century.       Early nurserymen in New Zealand, such as Alexander Allison, Bruno Just, and Hayward Wright, recognized the potential of the fruit and it soon became a popular backyard vine. Several plants were sent to the Chico Plant Introduction Station in California and exist to this date.       In addition to New Zealand and California, kiwifruit is also grown commercially in such areas as Italy, South Africa and Chile.                       The oblong fruit is up to 2-1/2 inches long, with russet-brown skin densely covered with short, stiff brown hairs.       The flesh, firm until fully ripe, is glistening, bright green or sometimes yellow, brownish or off-white, except for the white  center from which radiate many fine, pale lines. Between these lines are scattered minute dark-purple or nearly black seeds, unnoticeable in eating.       The flavor of kiwifruit is sweet/tart to acid, somewhat like that of the gooseberry with a suggestion of strawberry.       Firm kiwis, left at room temperature, soften and sweeten in three to five days. Ripe kiwis feel like ripe peaches.  Refrigerated, they stay fresh for weeks.  Average size is two to three inches long.  The kiwi has a furry brown skin which is peeled off before eating.  The inside should be lime green in color.        Kiwi may be used to tenderize meat.  They are available June to March.  When ripe, kiwi will give slightly to the touch.  They are low in calories and are an excellent source of  vitamin C .      Kiwifruit is also a source of minerals such as  potassium ,  calcium , and  phosphorus , and dietary  fiber .       The primary use of kiwi fruit is for the fresh market, although culled fruit is processed into canned and frozen fruit slices, wine, jam, juice, and dried products.       Kiwi is sometimes called a Chinese gooseberry, but is not related to the gooseberry.      Two kiwis equal the fiber in one cup of bran flakes.      Peel kiwis with a vegetable peeler for less waste.      To ripen kiwis faster, place them in a paper bag with an  apple  or a  banana .      Kiwis make an excellent meat tenderizer when pureed and used in a marinade.  Contains the chemical actinidin, which also is the chemical in kiwi that causes the gelatin not to gel if you add kiwi to gelatin.
