In some of the editions of his works he is called Megarensis, as if he had been born at  Megara  in  Greece , a mistake which arose from confounding him with  Euclid of Megara , a disciple of Socrates.   Proclus Diadochus  (AD 412-485), the authority for most of our information regarding Euclid, states in his commentary on the first book of the  Elements  that Euclid lived in the time of  Ptolemy I , king of  Egypt , who reigned from 323-285 BC, that he was younger than the associates of  Plato , but older than  Eratosthenes  (276-196 BC) and  Archimedes  (287-212 BC).  Euclid is said to have founded the mathematical school of  Alexandria , which was at the time becoming a center not only of commerce, but also of learning and research, and for this service to the cause of exact science he would have deserved commemoration, even if his writings had not secured him a worthier title to fame.   Proclus  preserves a reply made by Euclid to King Ptolemy, who asked whether he could not learn geometry more easily than by studying the Elements - ""There is no royal road to geometry.""   Pappus of Alexandria , in his  Mathematical Collection , says that  Euclid  was a man of mild and inoffensive temperament, unpretending, and kind to all genuine students of mathematics.  This being all that is known of the life and character of  Euclid , it only remains therefore to speak of his works.    Among those which have come down to us the most remarkable is the  Elements  ( Stoicheia ).  They consist of thirteen books; two more are frequently added, but there is reason to believe that they are the work of a later mathematician,  Hypsciles of Alexandria .   The question has often been mooted, to what extent  Euclid , in his  Elements , is a discoverer or a compiler.  To this question no entirely satisfactory answer can be given, for scarcely any of the writings of the earlier geometers have come down to our times.  We are mainly dependent on  Pappus  and  Proclus  for the scanty notices we have of Euclid's predecessors, and of the problems which engaged their attention; for the solution of problems, and not the discovery of theorems, would seem to have been their principal object.  From these authors we learn that the property of the right angled triangle has been found out, the principles of geometrical analysis laid down, the restriction of constructions in  plane geometry  to the straight line and the circle agreed upon, the doctrine of proportion, for both  commensurable s and  incommensurable s, as well as loci, plane and solid, and some of the properties of the conic sections investigated, the five regular solids (often called the  Platonic bodies ) and the relation between the volume of a cone or pyramid and that of its circumscribed cylinder or prism discovered.  Elementary works had been written, and the famous problem of the duplication of the cube reduced to the determination of two mean proportionals between two given straight lines.  Notwithstanding this amount of discovery, and all that it implied, Euclid must have made a great advance beyond his predecessors (we are told that ""he arranged the discoveries of  Eudoxus , perfected those of  Theaetetus , and reduced to invincible demonstration many things which had previously been more loosely proved""), for his  Elements  supplanted all similar treatises, and, as Apollonius received the title of ""the great geometer,"" so Euclid has come down to latter ages as ""the elementator.""   For the past twenty centuries parts of the  Elements , notably the  first six books , have been used as an introduction to  geometry .  Though they are now to some extent superseded in most countries, their long retention is a proof that they were, at any rate, no unsuitable for such a purpose.  They are, speaking generally, not too difficult for novices in the science; the demonstrations are rigorous, ingenious and often elegant the mixture of problems and theorems gives perhaps some variety, and makes their study less monotonous; and, if regard be had merely to the metrical properties of space as distinguished from the graphical, hardly any cardinal geometrical truths are omitted.  With these excellence are combined a good many defects, some of them inevitable to a system based on a very few axioms and postulates.  Thus the arrangement of the propositions seems arbitrary; associated theorems and problems are not grouped together; the classification, in short, is imperfect.  Other objections, not to mention minor blemishes, are the  prolixinty  of the style, arising partly from a defective nomenclature, the treatment of parallels depending on an axiom which is not axiomatic, and the sparing use of superposition as a method of proof.     Of the 33 ancient books subservient to geometrical analysis, Pappus enumerates first the  Data  ( Dedomena ), of Euclid.  He says it contained 90  proposition s, the scope of which he describes; it now contains 95.  It is not easy to explain this discrepancy, unless we suppose that some of the propositions, as they existed in the time of Pappus, have since been split into two, or that what were once  scholia  have since been erected into propositions.  The object of the  Data  is to show that when certain things - lines, angles, spaces, ratios, etc - are given by hypothesis, certain other things are given, that is, determinable.  The book, as we are expressly told, and as we may gather from its contents, was intended for the investigation of problems; and it has been conjectured that Euclid must have extended the method of the  Data  to the investigation of theorems.  What prompts this conjecture is the similarity between the analysis of a theorem and the method, common enough in the Elements, of  reductio ad absurdum  - the one setting out from the supposition that the theorem is true, the other from the supposition that it is false, thence in both cases deducing a chain of consequences that end in a conclusion previously known to be true or false.   The  Introduction to Harmony  ( Eisagoge armonike ), and the  Section of the Scale  ( Katatome kanonos ), treat of music.  There is good reason for believing that one at any rate, and probably both of these books are not by Euclid.  No mention is made of them by any writer prior to  Ptolemy  (AD 140), or by Ptolemy himself, and in no ancient codex are they ascribed to Euclid.   The  Phaenomena  ( Phainomena ) contains an exposition of the appearances produced by the motion attributed to the celestial sphere.  Pappus, in a few remarks prefatory to his sixth book complains of the faults, both of omission and commission, of writers of astronomy, and cites as an example of the former the second theorem of Euclid's Phaenomena, whence, and from the interpolation of other proofs,  David Gregory  infers that this treatise is corrupt.     The  Optics  and  Catoptrics  ( Optika, Katoptrika ) are ascribed to Euclid by Proclus, and by  Marinus  in his preface to the Data, but no mention is made of them by Pappus.  This latter circumstance, taken in connection with the fact that two of the propositions in the sixth book of the Mathematical Collection prove the same things as three in the Optics, is one of the reasons given by Gregory for deeming the work spurious.  Several other reasons will be found in Gregory's preface to his edition of Euclid's works.   In some editions of Euclid's works there is given a book on the  Divisions of Superfices , which consists of a few propositions, showing how a straight line may be drawn to divide in a given ratio triangles, quadrilaterals and pentagons.  This was supposed by  John Dee  of  London , who transcribed or translated it, and entrusted it for publication to his friend  Federico Commandino  of  Urbino , to be the treatise of Euclid referred to by Proclus as to  peri diaireseon biblion .  Dee mentions that, in the copy from which he wrote, the book was ascribed to  Machomet of Baghdad , and adduces two or three reasons for thinking it to be Euclid's.  This opinion, however, he does not seem to have held very strongly, nor does it appear that it was adopted by Commandino.  The book does not exist in Greek.   The fragment, in Latin,  De levi et ponderoso , which is of no value, and was printed at the end of Gregory's edition only in order that nothing might be left out, is mentioned neither by Pappus nor Proclus, and occurs first in  Bartholomew Zamberti 's edition of 1537.  There is no reason for supposing it to be genuine.   The following works attributed to Euclid are not now extant -  1. Three books on  Porisms  ( Peri ton porismaton ) are mentioned both by Pappus and Proclus, and the former gives an abstract of them, with the lemmas assumed.  2. Two books are mentioned, named  Topon pros epithaneia , which is rendered  Locorum ad superficiem  by Commandino and subsequent geomters.  These books were subservient to the analysis of  loci , but the four lemmas which refer to them and which occur at the end of the seventh book of the  Mathematical Collection , throw very little light on their contents.   R. Simson 's opinion was that they treated of curves of double curvature, and he intended at one time to write a treatise on the subject.  3. Pappus says that Euclid wrote four books on the  Conic Sections  ( biblia tessara Konikon ), which  Apollonius of Perga  amplified, and to which he added four more.  It is known that, in the time of Euclid, the parabola was considered as the section of a right angled cone, the ellipse that of an acute acute angled cone, the hyperbola that of an obtuse angled cone, and that Appolonius was the first to show that the three sections could be obtained from any cone.  There is good ground therefore for supposing that the first four books of Apollonius's  Conics , which are still extant, resemble Euclid's Conics even less than Euclid's Elements do those of Eudoxus and Theaetetus.  4. A book on  Fallacies  ( Peri pheudarion ) is mentioned by Proclus, who says Euclid wrote it for the purpose of exercising beginners in the detection of errors in reasoning.

clueweb09-enwp00-73-11127	"                     Euclid's Elements          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search                 The  frontispiece  of Sir Henry Billingsley's first English version of Euclid's  Elements , 1570       Euclid's  Elements  ( Greek :   ) is a  mathematical  and  geometric   treatise  consisting of 13 books written by the  Greek mathematician   Euclid  in  Alexandria   circa  300 BC. It comprises a collection of definitions, postulates ( axioms ), propositions ( theorems  and  constructions ), and  mathematical proofs  of the propositions. The thirteen books cover  Euclidean geometry  and the ancient Greek version of elementary  number theory . With the exception of  Autolycus'   On the Moving Sphere , the  Elements  is one of the oldest extant Greek mathematical treatises [ 1 ]  and it is the oldest extant axiomatic deductive treatment of  mathematics . [ 2 ]  It has proven instrumental in the development of  logic  and modern  science .   Euclid's  Elements  is the most successful [ 3 ] [ 4 ]  and influential [ 5 ]  textbook ever written. Being first set in type in  Venice  in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the  printing press  and is estimated to be second only to the  Bible  in the number of editions published, [ 5 ]  with the number reaching well over one thousand. [ 6 ]  It was used as the basic text on geometry throughout the Western world for about 2,000 years. For centuries, when the  quadrivium  was included in the curriculum of all university students, knowledge of at least part of Euclid's  Elements  was required of all students. Not until the 20th century, by which time its content was universally taught through school books, did it cease to be considered something all educated people had read. [ 2 ]           Contents       1   History     1.1   A difficult text       2   Outline of Elements     2.1   First principles   2.2   Parallel postulate   2.3   Contents of the books       3   Missing axioms   4   Apocrypha   5   Editions     5.1   Translations   5.2   Currently in print       6   Notes   7   References   8   External links               [ edit ]   History          The frontispiece of an  Adelard of Bath  Latin translation of Euclid's  Elements , c. 13091316; the oldest surviving Latin translation of the  Elements  is a 12th century work by Adelard, which translates to Latin from the Arabic. [ 7 ]       Euclid  was a  Greek  mathematician who wrote  Elements  in Alexandria during the  Hellenistic period  (around 300 BC). Scholars believe that the  Elements  is largely a collection of theorems proved by other mathematicians supplemented by some original work.  Proclus , a Greek mathematician who lived several centuries after Euclid, wrote in his commentary of the  Elements : ""Euclid, who put together the Elements, collecting many of  Eudoxus ' theorems, perfecting many of  Theaetetus ', and also bringing to irrefragable demonstration the things which were only somewhat loosely proved by his predecessors"".   Although known to, for instance,  Cicero , there is no extant record of the text having been translated into Latin prior to  Boethius  in the fifth or sixth century. [ 7 ]  The Arabs received the  Elements  from the Byzantines in approximately 760; this version, by a pupil of Euclid called  Proclo , was translated into  Arabic  under  Harun al Rashid  circa 800 AD. [ 7 ]  The first printed edition appeared in 1482 (based on  Giovanni Campano's  1260 edition), and since then it has been translated into many languages and published in about a thousand different editions. In 1570,  John Dee  provided a widely respected ""Mathematical Preface"", along with copious notes and supplementary material, to the first English edition by  Henry Billingsley .   Copies of the Greek text still exist, some of which can be found in the  Vatican Library  and the  Bodleian Library  in Oxford. The manuscripts available are of variable quality, and invariably incomplete. By careful analysis of the translations and originals, hypotheses have been drawn about the contents of the original text (copies of which are no longer available).   Ancient texts which refer to the  Elements  itself and to other mathematical theories that were current at the time it was written are also important in this process. Such analyses are conducted by  J. L. Heiberg  and Sir  Thomas Little Heath  in their editions of the text.   Also of importance are the  scholia , or annotations to the text. These additions, which often distinguished themselves from the main text (depending on the manuscript), gradually accumulated over time as opinions varied upon what was worthy of explanation or elucidation.     [ edit ]   A difficult text   Although we now consider the  Elements  to be an elementary text on geometry, that was not always the case. It is said that King  Ptolemy  asked for a way in geometry that was shorter than the Elements. Euclid answered that ""there is no  royal road  to geometry.""  [ 8 ]  More recently, Sir  Thomas Little Heath  wrote, in his introduction to the 1932 Everyman's Library volume of  Euclid :     The simple truth is that it was not written for schoolboys or schoolgirls, but for the grown man who would have the necessary knowledge and judgment to appreciate the highly contentious matters which have to be grappled with in any attempt to set out the essentials of Euclidean geometry as a strictly  logical system ..."". [ 9 ]     The first difficult passage of Book I is referred to as the  pons asinorum , which is Latin for ""Bridge of Asses"" (traditionally, it is hard to get  asses  to cross a bridge). [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   Outline of  Elements          A proof from Euclid's  Elements  that, given a line segment, an equilateral triangle exists that includes the segment as one of its sides. The proof is by construction: an equilateral triangle  is made by drawing circles  and  centered on the points  and , and taking one intersection of the circles as the third vertex of the triangle.       The  Elements  is still considered a masterpiece in the application of  logic  to  mathematics . In historical context, it has proven enormously influential in many areas of  science . Scientists  Nicolaus Copernicus ,  Johannes Kepler ,  Galileo Galilei , and Sir  Isaac Newton  were all influenced by the  Elements , and applied their knowledge of it to their work. Mathematicians and philosophers, such as  Bertrand Russell ,  Alfred North Whitehead , and  Baruch Spinoza , have attempted to create their own foundational ""Elements"" for their respective disciplines, by adopting the axiomatized deductive structures that Euclid's work introduced.   The success of the  Elements  is due primarily to its logical presentation of most of the mathematical knowledge available to Euclid. Much of the material is not original to him, although many of the proofs are his. However, Euclid's systematic development of his subject, from a small set of axioms to deep results, and the consistency of his approach throughout the  Elements , encouraged its use as a textbook for about 2,000 years. The  Elements  still influences modern geometry books. Further, its logical axiomatic approach and rigorous proofs remain the cornerstone of mathematics.   Although  Elements  is primarily a geometric work, it also includes results that today would be classified as  number theory . A construction used in any of Euclid's proofs required a proof that it is actually possible. This avoids the problems the Pythagoreans encountered with irrationals, since their fallacious proofs usually required a statement such as ""Find the greatest common measure of ..."" [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   First principles   Euclid's Book 1 begins with 23 definitions  such as  point ,  line , and  surface   followed by five  postulates  and five ""common notions"" (both of which are today called  axioms ). These are the foundation of all that follows.   Postulates:     A straight line segment can be drawn by joining any two points.   A straight line segment can be extended indefinitely in a straight line.   Given a straight line segment, a circle can be drawn using the segment as radius and one endpoint as center.   All right angles are equal.   If two lines are drawn which intersect a third in such a way that the sum of the inner angles on one side is less than two right angles, then the two lines inevitably must intersect each other on that side if extended far enough.     Common notions:     Things which equal the same thing are equal to one another. ( Euclidean property  of  equality )   If equals are added to equals, then the sums are equal. (Addition property of equality)   If equals are subtracted from equals, then the remainders are equal. (Subtraction property of equality)   Things which coincide with one another are equal to one another. ( Reflexive property  of equality)   The whole is greater than the part.     These basic principles reflect the interest of Euclid, along with his contemporary Greek and Hellenistic mathematicians, in constructive geometry. The first three postulates basically describe the  constructions  one can carry out with a  compass  and an unmarked  straightedge . A marked  ruler , used in  neusis construction , is forbidden in Euclid construction.     [ edit ]   Parallel postulate       Main article:  Parallel postulate              If the sum of the two interior angles equals 180, the lines are parallel and will never intersect.       The last of Euclid's five postulates warrants special mention. Euclid's fifth postulate implies that when parallel lines are crossed by a transversal then same side interior angles are supplementary. In Euclid's system the converse is also true (see figure). Together these statements may be given in a logically equivalent form known as  Playfair's axiom , named after the Scottish  mathematician   John Playfair . It states:     Exactly one line can be drawn through any point not on a given line  parallel  to the given line in a plane. [ 12 ]     The so-called  parallel postulate  always seemed less obvious than the others. Euclid himself used it only sparingly throughout the rest of the  Elements . Many geometers suspected that it might be provable from the other postulates, but all attempts to do this failed.   By the mid-19th century, it was shown that no such proof exists, because one can construct  non-Euclidean geometries  where the parallel postulate is false, while the other postulates remain true. For this reason, mathematicians say that the parallel postulate is  independent  of the other postulates.   Two alternatives to the parallel postulate are possible in non-Euclidean geometries: in a  hyperbolic geometry  (also called  Lobachevskian  geometry ) an infinite number of parallel lines can be drawn through a point not on a given line, whereas in an  elliptic geometry  (also called  Riemannian geometry ) no parallel lines exist. That other geometries could be logically consistent was one of the most important discoveries in mathematics, with vast implications for science and philosophy. Indeed,  Albert Einstein 's theory of  general relativity  hypothesizes that the real space in which we live is non-Euclidean.     [ edit ]   Contents of the books          A fragment of Euclid's elements found at  Oxyrhynchus , which is dated to circa 100 AD. The diagram accompanies Proposition 5 of Book II of the  Elements .       Books 1 through 4 deal with plane geometry:     Book 1 contains Euclid's 5 axioms (including the  parallel postulate ) and the basic propositions of geometry: the  pons asinorum  (proposition 5) , the  Pythagorean theorem  (Proposition 47), equality of angles and  areas , parallelism, the sum of the angles in a triangle, and the three cases in which triangles are ""equal"" (have the same area).   Book 2 is commonly called the ""book of geometrical algebra,"" because the material it contains may easily be interpreted in terms of  algebra .   Book 3 deals with circles and their properties:  inscribed  angles,  tangents , the power of a point.   Book 4 constructs the  incircle  and  circumcircle  of a triangle, and constructs  regular polygons  with 4, 5, 6, and 15 sides.     Books 5 through 10 introduce  ratios  and  proportions :     Book 5 is a treatise on proportions of  magnitudes . Proposition 25 has as a special case the  inequality of arithmetic and geometric means .   Book 6 applies proportions to geometry:  Thales' theorem , similar figures.   Book 7 deals strictly with elementary number theory:  divisibility ,  prime numbers ,  Euclid's algorithm  for finding the  greatest common divisor ,  least common multiple . Propositions 30 and 32 together are essentially equivalent to the  fundamental theorem of arithmetic  stating that every positive integer can be written as a product of primes in an essentially unique way, though Euclid would have had trouble stating it in this modern form as he did not use the product of more than 3 numbers.   Book 8 deals with proportions in number theory and  geometric sequences .   Book 9 applies the results of the preceding two books and gives the infinitude of prime numbers (proposition 20), the sum of a  geometric series  (proposition 35), and the construction of even  perfect numbers  (proposition 36).   Book 10 attempts to classify  incommensurable  (in modern language,  irrational ) magnitudes by using the  method of exhaustion , a precursor to  integration .     Books 11 through 13 deal with spatial geometry:     Book 11 generalizes the results of Books 16 to space: perpendicularity, parallelism, volumes of  parallelepipeds .   Book 12 calculates areas and volumes by using the method of exhaustion:  cones ,  pyramids ,  cylinders , and the  sphere .   Book 13 constructs the five regular  Platonic solids  inscribed in a sphere, calculates the ratio of their edges to the radius of the sphere, and proves that there are no further regular solids.       [ edit ]   Missing axioms   The  Elements  tacitly assumes several axioms that it does not explicitly state. For example, in the first construction of Book 1, Euclid used a premise that was neither postulated nor proved: that two circles with centers at the distance of their radius will intersect in two points. Later, in the fourth construction, he used the movement of triangles to prove that if two sides and their angles are equal, then they are congruent; however, he did not postulate or even define movement.   Richard Dedekind  and  David Hilbert  reformulated the axioms of the  Elements , by adding extra axioms such as an axiom of continuity and an axiom of congruence, to make the axioms of Euclidean geometry complete.  Hilbert's axioms  were not first order and so depended implicitly on either set theory or  second order logic , but Tarski later gave  Tarski's axioms , a complete first order set of axioms for Euclidean geometry.   Mathematician and historian  W. W. Rouse Ball  put the criticisms in perspective, remarking that ""the fact that for two thousand years [the  Elements ] was the usual text-book on the subject raises a strong presumption that it is not unsuitable for that purpose."" [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   Apocrypha   It was not uncommon in ancient time to attribute to celebrated authors works that were not written by them. It is by these means that the  apocryphal  books XIV and XV of the  Elements  were sometimes included in the collection. [ 14 ]  The spurious Book XIV was likely written by  Hypsicles  on the basis of a treatise by  Apollonius . The book continues Euclid's comparison of regular solids inscribed in spheres, with the chief result being that the ratio of the surfaces of the  dodecahedron  and  icosahedron  inscribed in the same sphere is the same as the ratio of their volumes, the ratio being  .

Alexandria, Egypt Greek mathematician   The Greek mathematician (math expert) Euclid wrote the  Elements,  a thirteen-volume set of textbooks of geometry (the study of points, lines, angles, and surfaces)—the oldest major mathematical work existing in the Western world.     Unknown background   Almost nothing is known of Euclid personally. It is not even known for certain whether he was really a creative mathematician or was simply good at collecting and editing the work of others. Most of the information about Euclid comes from Proclus (411–485 C. E.), a fifth-century Greek scholar. Some believed Euclid was the son of a Greek man who was born in Tyre and lived in Damascus. His mathematical education may have been obtained from students of Plato (c. 427  B.C.E. –347  B.C.E. ) in Athens, Greece, since most of the earlier mathematicians upon whose work the  Elements  is based had studied and taught there.       The  Elements   No earlier writings similar to the  Elements  have survived. One reason is that the  Elements  expanded on all previous writings of this type, so keeping any earlier texts around was thought to be unnecessary. For example, about 600  B.C.E.  the Greek mathematician  Thales (c. 625–c. 546  B.C.E. ) is said to have discovered a number of theorems (statements that can be demonstrated or proved) that appear in the  Elements.  Early mathematics dealt only with concrete problems, such as determining areas and volumes. By Euclid's time, mathematics had become more of an intellectual occupation for philosophers (thinkers, or seekers of wisdom) rather than for only scientists.   The  Elements  consists of thirteen books. Each book contains a number of theorems, from about ten to one hundred, which follow a series of definitions. The usual elementary course in Euclidean geometry is based on ""Book I."" ""Book V"" is one of the finest works in Greek mathematics, a masterful description of the theory of proportions (the relation of one part to another part or the sum of all parts) originally discovered by Eudoxus. ""Book VI"" applies the statements of ""Book V"" to the figures of plane geometry (the study of flat surfaces and the relationships of figures lying within the surfaces). In ""Book VII"" a prime number is defined as that which is measured by a unit alone (a prime number can be divided only by itself and the number 1). ""Book IX"" contains Euclid's proof that there are infinitely many prime numbers, which is still used in current algebra textbooks.   The  Elements  were translated into Latin and Arabic, but it was not until the first printed edition, published in 1482, that they became important in European education. The first complete English version was printed in 1570. It was during the most active mathematical period in England, about 1700, that Greek mathematics was studied most closely. Euclid's writings were used by        Euclid.   Courtesy of the   Library of Congress .     all major mathematicians, including Isaac Newton (1642–1727). The growing importance of the sciences and mathematics in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries helped Euclid's ideas keep their influence in schools and universities throughout the Western (having to do with nations of Europe and America) world.       Euclid's other works   Some of Euclid's other works are known only because other writers have mentioned them. The book  Data  discusses plane geometry and contains propositions (problems to be demonstrated) in which certain data are  given about a figure and from which other data can be figured out. Euclid's  On Division,  also dealing with plane geometry, is concerned with more general problems of division. A work by Euclid that has survived is  Phaenomena.  This is what today would be called applied mathematics, concerning the geometry of spheres for use in astronomy.   Another surviving work, the  Optics,  corrects the belief held at the time that the sun and other heavenly bodies are actually the size they appear to be to the eye. This work discusses the relationship between what the eye sees of an object and what the object actually is. For example, the eye always sees less than half of a sphere, and as the observer moves closer to the sphere, the part of it that is seen is decreased, although it appears larger.   Another lost work is the  Porisms.  A porism is somewhere between a theorem and a problem; that is, rather than something to be proved or something to be constructed, a porism is concerned with bringing out another feature of something that is already there. To find the center of a circle or to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers are examples of porisms. This work appears to have been more advanced than the  Elements,  and perhaps if it still existed it would give Euclid a higher place in the history of mathematics.

He was active in  Alexandria  during the reign of  Ptolemy I  (323 BC  283 BC). His work  Elements  is the most successful  textbook  in the  history of mathematics . [ 1 ] [ 2 ]  In it, the principles of what is now called  Euclidean geometry  were deduced from a small set of  axioms . Euclid also wrote works on  perspective ,  conic sections ,  spherical geometry ,  number theory  and  rigor .

The biographical information that we do have comes largely from commentaries by  Proclus  and  Pappus of Alexandria . Euclid was active at the great  Library of Alexandria  and may have studied at  Plato's Academy  in  Greece . The date and place of Euclid's birth and the date and circumstances of his death are unknown.   Some writers in the  Middle Ages  confused him with  Euclid of Megara , a Greek  Socratic   philosopher  who lived approximately one century earlier. [ 3 ]     The  Elements       Main article:  Euclid's Elements              One of the oldest surviving fragments of Euclid's  Elements , found at  Oxyrhynchus  and dated to circa AD 100. The diagram accompanies Book II, Proposition 5. [ 4 ]       Although many of the results in  Elements  originated with earlier mathematicians, one of Euclid's accomplishments was to present them in a single, logically coherent framework, making it easy to use and easy to reference, including a system of rigorous mathematical proofs that remains the basis of mathematics 23 centuries later. [ citation needed ]   Although best-known for its geometric results, the  Elements  also includes  number theory . It considers the connection between  perfect numbers  and  Mersenne primes , the infinitude of  prime numbers ,  Euclid's lemma  on factorization (which leads to the  fundamental theorem of arithmetic  on uniqueness of  prime factorizations ), and the  Euclidean algorithm  for finding the  greatest common divisor  of two numbers.   The geometrical system described in the  Elements  was long known simply as  geometry , and was considered to be the only geometry possible. Today, however, that system is often referred to as  Euclidean geometry  to distinguish it from other so-called  Non-Euclidean geometries  that mathematicians discovered in the 19th century.       Other works          Euclid, as imagined by  Raphael  in this detail from  The School of Athens . No likeness or description of Euclid's physical appearance made during his lifetime survived antiquity. Therefore, Euclid's depiction in works of art depends on the artist's imagination.       In addition to the  Elements , at least five works of Euclid have survived to the present day. They follow the same logical structure as  Elements , with definitions and proved propositions.     Data  deals with the nature and implications of ""given"" information in geometrical problems; the subject matter is closely related to the first four books of the  Elements .   On Divisions of Figures , which survives only partially in  Arabic  translation, concerns the division of geometrical figures into two or more equal parts or into parts in given  ratios . It is similar to a third century AD work by  Heron of Alexandria .   Catoptrics , which concerns the mathematical theory of mirrors, particularly the images formed in plane and spherical concave mirrors. The attribution to Euclid is doubtful. Its author may have been  Theon of Alexandria .   Phenomena , a treatise on  spherical astronomy , survives in Greek; it is quite similar to  On the Moving Sphere  by  Autolycus of Pitane , who flourished around 310 BC.   Optics  is the earliest surviving Greek treatise on perspective. In its definitions Euclid follows the Platonic tradition that vision is caused by discrete rays which emanate from the eye. One important definition is the fourth: ""Things seen under a greater angle appear greater, and those under a lesser angle less, while those under equal angles appear equal."" In the 36         Statue of Euclid in the  Oxford University Museum of Natural History      propositions that follow, Euclid relates the apparent size of an object to its distance from the eye and investigates the apparent shapes of cylinders and cones when viewed from different angles. Proposition 45 is interesting, proving that for any two unequal magnitudes, there is a point from which the two appear equal.  Pappus  believed these results to be important in astronomy and included Euclid's  Optics , along with his  Phaenomena , in the  Little Astronomy , a compendium of smaller works to be studied before the  Syntaxis  ( Almagest ) of  Claudius Ptolemy .     Other works are credibly attributed to Euclid, but have been lost.     Conics  was a work on  conic sections  that was later extended by  Apollonius of Perga  into his famous work on the subject. It is likely that the first four books of Apollonius's work come directly from Euclid. According to Pappus, ""Apollonius, having completed Euclid's four books of conics and added four others, handed down eight volumes of conics."" The Conics of Apollonius quickly supplanted the former work, and by the time of Pappus, Euclid's work was already lost.   Porisms  might have been an outgrowth of Euclid's work with conic sections, but the exact meaning of the title is controversial.   Pseudaria , or  Book of Fallacies , was an elementary text about errors in  reasoning .   Surface Loci  concerned either  loci  (sets of points) on surfaces or loci which were themselves surfaces; under the latter interpretation, it has been hypothesized that the work might have dealt with  quadric surfaces .   Several works on  mechanics  are attributed to Euclid by Arabic sources.  On the Heavy and the Light  contains, in nine definitions and five propositions, Aristotelian notions of moving bodies and the concept of specific gravity.  On the Balance  treats the theory of the lever in a similarly Euclidean manner, containing one definition, two axioms, and four propositions. A third fragment, on the circles described by the ends of a moving lever, contains four propositions. These three works complement each other in such a way that it has been suggested that they are remnants of a single treatise on mechanics written by Euclid.

He was active in  Alexandria  during the reign of  Ptolemy I  (323 BC  283 BC). His work  Elements  is the most successful  textbook  in the  history of mathematics . [ 1 ] [ 2 ]  In it, the principles of what is now called  Euclidean geometry  were deduced from a small set of  axioms . Euclid also wrote works on  perspective ,  conic sections ,  spherical geometry ,  number theory  and  rigor .

The biographical information that we do have comes largely from commentaries by  Proclus  and  Pappus of Alexandria . Euclid was active at the great  Library of Alexandria  and may have studied at  Plato's Academy  in  Greece . The date and place of Euclid's birth and the date and circumstances of his death are unknown.   Some writers in the  Middle Ages  confused him with  Euclid of Megara , a Greek  Socratic   philosopher  who lived approximately one century earlier. [ 3 ]     The  Elements       Main article:  Euclid's Elements              One of the oldest surviving fragments of Euclid's  Elements , found at  Oxyrhynchus  and dated to circa AD 100. The diagram accompanies Book II, Proposition 5. [ 4 ]       Although many of the results in  Elements  originated with earlier mathematicians, one of Euclid's accomplishments was to present them in a single, logically coherent framework, making it easy to use and easy to reference, including a system of rigorous mathematical proofs that remains the basis of mathematics 23 centuries later. [ citation needed ]   Although best-known for its geometric results, the  Elements  also includes  number theory . It considers the connection between  perfect numbers  and  Mersenne primes , the infinitude of  prime numbers ,  Euclid's lemma  on factorization (which leads to the  fundamental theorem of arithmetic  on uniqueness of  prime factorizations ), and the  Euclidean algorithm  for finding the  greatest common divisor  of two numbers.   The geometrical system described in the  Elements  was long known simply as  geometry , and was considered to be the only geometry possible. Today, however, that system is often referred to as  Euclidean geometry  to distinguish it from other so-called  Non-Euclidean geometries  that mathematicians discovered in the 19th century.       Other works          Euclid, as imagined by  Raphael  in this detail from  The School of Athens . No likeness or description of Euclid's physical appearance made during his lifetime survived antiquity. Therefore, Euclid's depiction in works of art depends on the artist's imagination.       In addition to the  Elements , at least five works of Euclid have survived to the present day. They follow the same logical structure as  Elements , with definitions and proved propositions.     Data  deals with the nature and implications of ""given"" information in geometrical problems; the subject matter is closely related to the first four books of the  Elements .   On Divisions of Figures , which survives only partially in  Arabic  translation, concerns the division of geometrical figures into two or more equal parts or into parts in given  ratios . It is similar to a third century AD work by  Heron of Alexandria .   Catoptrics , which concerns the mathematical theory of mirrors, particularly the images formed in plane and spherical concave mirrors. The attribution to Euclid is doubtful. Its author may have been  Theon of Alexandria .   Phenomena , a treatise on  spherical astronomy , survives in Greek; it is quite similar to  On the Moving Sphere  by  Autolycus of Pitane , who flourished around 310 BC.   Optics  is the earliest surviving Greek treatise on perspective. In its definitions Euclid follows the Platonic tradition that vision is caused by discrete rays which emanate from the eye. One important definition is the fourth: ""Things seen under a greater angle appear greater, and those under a lesser angle less, while those under equal angles appear equal."" In the 36         Statue of Euclid in the  Oxford University Museum of Natural History      propositions that follow, Euclid relates the apparent size of an object to its distance from the eye and investigates the apparent shapes of cylinders and cones when viewed from different angles. Proposition 45 is interesting, proving that for any two unequal magnitudes, there is a point from which the two appear equal.  Pappus  believed these results to be important in astronomy and included Euclid's  Optics , along with his  Phaenomena , in the  Little Astronomy , a compendium of smaller works to be studied before the  Syntaxis  ( Almagest ) of  Claudius Ptolemy .     Other works are credibly attributed to Euclid, but have been lost.     Conics  was a work on  conic sections  that was later extended by  Apollonius of Perga  into his famous work on the subject. It is likely that the first four books of Apollonius's work come directly from Euclid. According to Pappus, ""Apollonius, having completed Euclid's four books of conics and added four others, handed down eight volumes of conics."" The Conics of Apollonius quickly supplanted the former work, and by the time of Pappus, Euclid's work was already lost.   Porisms  might have been an outgrowth of Euclid's work with conic sections, but the exact meaning of the title is controversial.   Pseudaria , or  Book of Fallacies , was an elementary text about errors in  reasoning .   Surface Loci  concerned either  loci  (sets of points) on surfaces or loci which were themselves surfaces; under the latter interpretation, it has been hypothesized that the work might have dealt with  quadric surfaces .   Several works on  mechanics  are attributed to Euclid by Arabic sources.  On the Heavy and the Light  contains, in nine definitions and five propositions, Aristotelian notions of moving bodies and the concept of specific gravity.  On the Balance  treats the theory of the lever in a similarly Euclidean manner, containing one definition, two axioms, and four propositions. A third fragment, on the circles described by the ends of a moving lever, contains four propositions. These three works complement each other in such a way that it has been suggested that they are remnants of a single treatise on mechanics written by Euclid.

clueweb09-enwp01-47-22054	"                     Parallel postulate          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Parallelism axiom )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search                 If the sum of the interior angles  and  is less than 180, the two straight lines, produced indefinitely, meet on that side.       In  geometry , the  parallel postulate , also called  Euclid 's fifth postulate  because it is the fifth postulate in  Euclid's  Elements , is a distinctive  axiom  in what is now called  Euclidean geometry . It states that:     If a  line segment  intersects two straight  lines  forming two interior angles on the same side that sum to less than two  right angles , then the two lines, if extended indefinitely, meet on that side on which the angles sum to less than two right angles.     Euclidean geometry  is the study of geometry that satisfies all of Euclid's axioms,  including  the parallel postulate. A geometry where the parallel postulate cannot hold is known as a  non-euclidean geometry . Geometry that is  independent  of Euclid's fifth postulate (i.e., only assumes the first four postulates) is known as  absolute geometry  (or, in other places known as neutral geometry).

Euclid did not postulate the  converse  of his fifth postulate, which is one way to distinguish Euclidean geometry from  elliptic geometry . The Elements contains the proof of an equivalent statement (Book I, Proposition 17):  Any two  angles  of a  triangle  are together less than two  right angles .  The proof depends on an earlier proposition:  In a triangle ABC, the  exterior angle  at C is greater than either of the  interior angles  A or B . This in turn depends on Euclid's unstated assumption that two straight lines meet in only one point, a statement not true of elliptic geometry.   In other words, the converse of the fifth postulate follows from Euclid's axioms minus the fifth postulate, plus an axiom stating that two distinct non-parallel straight lines meet in only one point.     [ edit ]   Logically equivalent properties   Euclid's parallel postulate is equivalent to Playfair's axiom, named after the Scottish  mathematician   John Playfair , which states:     At most one line can be drawn through any point not on a given line  parallel  to the given line in a plane. [ 1 ]     Many other equivalent statements to the parallel postulate or to Playfair's axiom have been suggested, some of them appearing at first to be unrelated to parallelism, and some seeming so  self-evident  that they were  unconsciously  assumed by people who claimed to have proven the parallel postulate from Euclid's other postulates.     The sum of the  angles  in every  triangle  is 180.   There exists a triangle whose angles add up to 180.   The sum of the angles is the same for every triangle.   There exists a pair of  similar , but not  congruent , triangles.   Every triangle can be  circumscribed .   If three angles of a  quadrilateral  are  right angles , then the fourth angle is also a right angle.   There exists a quadrilateral of which all angles are right angles.   There exists a pair of straight lines that are at constant  distance  from each other.   Two lines that are parallel to the same line are also parallel to each other.   Given two parallel lines, any line that intersects one of them also intersects the other.   In a  right-angled triangle , the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides ( Pythagoras' Theorem ).   There is no upper limit to the  area  of a triangle.  [1]     However, the alternatives which employ the word ""parallel"" cease appearing so simple when one is obliged to explain which of the three common definitions of ""parallel"" is meant - constant separation, never meeting or same angles where crossed by a third line - since the equivalence of these three is itself one of the unconsciously obvious assumptions equivalent to Euclid's fifth postulate.     [ edit ]   History   For two thousand years, many attempts were made to prove the parallel postulate using Euclid's first four postulates. The main reason that such a proof was so highly sought after was that the fifth postulate isn't self-evident unlike the other postulates. If the order the postulates were listed in the Elements is significant, it indicates that Euclid included this postulate only when he realised he could not prove it or proceed without it. [ 2 ]   Ibn al-Haytham  (Alhazen) (965-1039), an  Iraqi mathematician , made the first attempt at proving the parallel postulate using a  proof by contradiction , [ 3 ]  where he introduced the concept of  motion  and  transformation  into geometry. [ 4 ]  He formulated the  Lambert quadrilateral , which Boris Abramovich Rozenfeld names the ""Ibn al-HaythamLambert quadrilateral"", [ 5 ]  and his attempted proof also shows similarities to  Playfair's axiom . [ 6 ]   Omar Khayym  (1050-1123) made the first attempt at formulating a non-Euclidean  postulate  as an alternative to the parallel postulate, [ 7 ]  and he was the first to consider the cases of  elliptical geometry  and  hyperbolic geometry , though he excluded the latter. [ 8 ]  The  Khayyam-Saccheri quadrilateral  was also first considered by Omar Khayyam in the late 11th century in Book I of  Explanations of the Difficulties in the Postulates of Euclid . [ 5 ]  Unlike many commentators on Euclid before and after him (including  Giovanni Girolamo Saccheri ), Khayyam was not trying to prove the parallel postulate as such but to derive it from an equivalent postulate: ""Two convergent straight lines intersect and it is impossible for two convergent straight lines to diverge in the direction in which they converge."" [ 9 ]  He recognized that three possibilities arose from omitting Euclid's Fifth; if two perpendiculars to one line cross another line, judicious choice of the last can make the internal angles where it meets the two perpendiculars equal (it is then parallel to the first line). If those equal internal angles are right angles, we get Euclid's Fifth; otherwise, they must be either acute or obtuse. He persuaded himself that the acute and obtuse cases lead to contradiction, but had made a tacit assumption equivalent to the fifth to get there.   Nasir al-Din al-Tusi  (1201-1274), in his  Al-risala al-shafiya'an al-shakk fi'l-khutut al-mutawaziya  ( Discussion Which Removes Doubt about Parallel Lines ) (1250), wrote detailed critiques of the parallel postulate and on Khayym's attempted proof a century earlier. Nasir al-Din attempted to derive a proof by contradiction of the parallel postulate. [ 10 ]  He was also one of the first to consider the cases of elliptical geometry and hyperbolic geometry, though he ruled out both of them. [ 8 ]          Euclidean, elliptical and hyperbolic geometry. The Parallel Postulate is satisfied only for models of Euclidean geometry.       Nasir al-Din's son, Sadr al-Din (sometimes known as ""Pseudo-Tusi""), wrote a book on the subject in 1298, based on Nasir al-Din's later thoughts, which presented one of the earliest arguments for a non-Euclidean hypothesis equivalent to the parallel postulate. ""He essentially revised both the Euclidean system of axioms and postulates and the proofs of many propositions from the  Elements ."" [ 10 ] [ 11 ]  His work was published in  Rome  in 1594 and was studied by European geometers. This work marked the starting point for Saccheri's work on the subject. [ 10 ]   Giordano Vitale  (1633-1711), in his book  Euclide restituo  (1680, 1686), used the Khayyam-Saccheri quadrilateral to prove that if three points are equidistant on the base AB and the summit CD, then AB and CD are everywhere equidistant.  Girolamo Saccheri  (1667-1733) pursued the same line of reasoning more thoroughly, correctly obtaining absurdity from the obtuse case (proceeding, like Euclid, from the implicit assumption that lines can be extended indefinitely and have infinite length), but failing to debunk the acute case (although he managed to wrongly persuade himself that he had).   Where Khayym and Saccheri had attempted to prove Euclid's fifth by disproving the only possible alternatives, the nineteenth century finally saw mathematicians exploring those alternatives and discovering the  logically consistent  geometries which result. In 1829,  Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky  published an account of acute geometry in an obscure Russian journal (later re-published in 1840 in German). In 1831,  Jnos Bolyai  included, in a book by his father, an appendix describing acute geometry, which, doubtlessly, he had developed independently of Lobachevsky.  Carl Friedrich Gauss  had actually studied the problem before that, but he did not publish any of his results. However, upon hearing of Boylai's results in a letter from Bolyai's father,  Farkas Bolyai , he stated:     ""If I commenced by saying that I am unable to praise this work, you would certainly be surprised for a moment. But I cannot say otherwise. To praise it would be to praise myself. Indeed the whole contents of the work, the path taken by your son, the results to which he is led, coincide almost entirely with my meditations, which have occupied my mind partly for the last thirty or thirty-five years."" [ 12 ]     The resulting geometries were later developed by  Lobachevsky ,  Riemann  and  Poincar  into  hyperbolic geometry  (the acute case) and  spherical geometry  (the obtuse case). The  independence  of the parallel postulate from Euclid's other axioms was finally demonstrated by  Eugenio Beltrami  in 1868.     [ edit ]   Criticism   Attempts to logically prove this postulate, rather than the eighth axiom, were criticized by  Schopenhauer , as described in  Schopenhauer's criticism of the proofs of the Parallel Postulate .

clueweb09-en0000-75-11396	"    Not much is known about Euclid's life.  All that can really be said is that he received his mathematical training at Athens from the pupils of Plato,  and that he taught and founded a school in Alexandria.  One thing we do know for sure about Euclid is that his books, ""The Elements"", are the most successful in mathematical history.  In fifteen books he defines modern day geometry.  His textbooks were in use until the 20th century!    The Arabs of the time also thought highly of Euclid.  In Arabic the name of Euclid is pronounced Uclides, which is equivalent to ""key of Geometry"".  Euclid is geometry, now and forever.      RETURN TO GREEK MATHEMATICS HOME PAGE    "
clueweb09-enwp01-84-21898	"                     Short-term memory          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search          Short-term memory  (sometimes referred to as ""primary  memory "" or ""active memory"") refers to the capacity for holding a small amount of  information  in  mind  in an active, readily available state for a short period of time. The duration of short-term memory (when rehearsal is prevented) is assumed to be in the order of seconds. Estimates of the capacity of short-term memory vary  from about 3 or 4 elements (i.e., words, digits, or letters) to about 9 elements. A commonly-cited capacity is  72  elements. In contrast,  long-term memory  indefinitely stores a seemingly unlimited amount of information.           Contents       1   Existence of a separate store   2   Broadbent's filter theory   3   Relationship to working memory   4   Duration of short-term memory   5   Capacity of short-term memory     5.1   Chunking       6   See also   7   References     7.1   Notes   7.2   Bibliography       8   External links               [ edit ]   Existence of a separate store   A classical model of memory developed in the 1960s assumed that all memories pass from a short-term to a long-term store after a small period of time. This model is referred to as the ""modal model"" and has been most famously detailed by  Atkinson  and  Shiffrin . [ 1 ]  The exact mechanisms by which this transfer takes place, whether all or only some memories are retained permanently, and indeed the existence of a genuine distinction between the two stores, remain controversial topics among experts.   One form of evidence, cited in favor of the separate existence of a short-term store comes from  anterograde amnesia , the inability to learn new facts and episodes. Patients with this form of amnesia, typically caused by damage to the  hippocampus , have intact ability to retain small amounts of information over short time scales (up to 30 seconds) but are dramatically impaired in their ability to form longer-term memories (a famous example is  patient HM ). This is interpreted as showing that the short-term store is spared from amnesia.   Other evidence comes from experimental studies showing that some manipulations (e.g., a distractor task, such as repeatedly subtracting a single-digit number from a larger number following learning) impair memory for the 3 to 5 most recently learned words of a list (presumably still held in short-term memory), while leaving recall for words from earlier in the list (presumably stored in long-term memory) unaffected; other manipulations (e.g., semantic similarity of the words) affect only memory for earlier list words, [ 2 ]  but do not affect memory for the last few words in a list. These results show that different factors affect short term recall (disruption of rehearsal) and long-term recall (semantic similarity). Together, these findings show that long-term memory and short-term memory can vary independently of each other.   Not all researchers agree that short-term and long-term memory are separate systems. Some theorists propose that memory is unitary over all time scales, from milliseconds to years [ 3 ] . Support for the unitary memory hypothesis comes from the fact that it has been difficult to demarcate a clear boundary between short-term and long-term memory. For instance, Tarnow shows that the recall probability vs. latency curve is a straight line from 6 to 600 seconds, with the probability of failure to recall only saturating after 600 seconds  [ 4 ] . If there were really two different memory stores operating in this time frame, one could expect a discontinuity in this curve. Other research has shown that the detailed pattern of recall errors looks remarkably similar for recall of a list immediately after learning (presumably from short-term memory) and recall after 24 hours (necessarily from long-term memory) [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Broadbent's filter theory   Broadbent's theories of  selective attention  and  short-term memory  were developed as digital computers were beginning to become available to the academic community, and were among the first to use computer analogies to make a serious contribution to the analysis of human cognition. They were combined to form what became known as the ""single channel hypothesis"". His Filter Model proposed that the physical characteristics (e.g., pitch, loudness) of an auditorily presented message were used to focus attention to only a single message. Broadbent's Filter model is referred to as an  early selection  model because irrelevant messages are filtered out before the stimulus information is processed for meaning. These and other theories were brought together in his 1958 book ""Perception and Communication"" which remains one of the classic texts of cognitive psychology [ 6 ] .   Accounts for a theoretical filter device, which is located in , between the incoming sensory register, and the short-term memory storage. His theory is based upon the  multi-storage paradigm  of  William James (1890) and later the  Atkinson & Shiffrin's 'multi-store' memory model  (1968). This filter functions together with a buffer, and enables the subject to handle two kinds of stimuli, presented at the same time. One of the inputs is allowed through the filter, while the other is waiting in in the buffer for later processing. The filter prevents overloading of the limited capacity mechanism beyond the filter, which is the  short-term memory [ 7 ] . It is based on the famous cocktail party problem of the British scientist  Colin Cherry , who is trying to explain how we are able to focus our attention towards the  stimuli  which we find most interesting. [ 8 ] Broadbent comes up with the theory based on data from an experiment where three pairs of different digits are presented simultaneously, three digits in one ear and three in the other. Most participants recalled the digits ear by ear, rather than pair by pair. Thus, if 496 were presented to one ear and 852 to the other, the recall would be 496852 rather than 489562.     [ edit ]   Relationship to working memory   The relationship between short-term memory and  working memory  is differently described by various theorists, but it is generally acknowledged that the two concepts are distinct. Working memory is a theoretical framework that refers to structures and processes used for temporarily storing and manipulating information. As such, working memory might also be referred to as working attention. Short-term memory generally refers in a theory-neutral manner to the short term storage of information. Thus while there are short-term memory components to working memory models, the concept of short-term memory is distinct from these more hypothetical concepts. Within  Baddeley 's influential 1986 model of working memory there are two short-term storage mechanisms: the  phonological loop  and the  visuospatial sketchpad . Most of the research referred to here involves the phonological loop, because most of the work done on short-term memory has used verbal material. In recent years, however, there has been a surge in research on  visual short term memory [ 9 ] , and also increasing work on spatial short term memory [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   Duration of short-term memory   The most important characteristic of a short-term store is, clearly, that it is short-term  that is, it retains information for a limited amount of time only. Once information makes it past our sensory buffers, it passes into our short term memory, a second system for retaining information on our memories for brief periods of time. Most definitions of short-term memory limit the duration of storage to less than a minute; no more than about 30 seconds, and in some models as little as 2 seconds. Memory that exceeds short-term memory duration limits is regarded as long-term memory.   The limited duration of short-term memory immediately suggests that its contents spontaneously decay over time. The decay assumption is part of many theories of short-term memory, most notably  Baddeley's model of working memory . The decay assumption is usually paired with the idea of rapid  covert rehearsal : In order to overcome the limitation of short-term memory, and retain information for longer, information must be periodically repeated, or rehearsed  either by articulating it out loud, or by mentally simulating such articulation. In this way, the information will re-enter the short-term store and be retained for a further period.   Several researchers, however, dispute that spontaneous decay plays any significant role in forgetting over the short term  [ 11 ] [ 12 ] , and the evidence is far from conclusive [ 13 ] .   Authors doubting that decay causes forgetting from short-term memory often offer as an alternative some form of interference: When several elements (such as digits, words, or pictures) are held in short term memory simultaneously, their representations compete with each other for recall, or degrade each other. Thereby, new content gradually pushes out older content, unless the older content is actively protected against interference by rehearsal or by directing attention to it [ 14 ] .     [ edit ]   Capacity of short-term memory   Whatever the cause or causes of forgetting over the short term may be, there is consensus that it severely limits the amount of new information that we can retain over brief periods of time. This limit is referred to as the finite capacity of short-term memory. The capacity of short-term memory is often called ""memory span"", in reference to a common procedure of measuring it: The experimenter presents lists of items (e.g., digits or words) of increasing length; the tested person's span is determined as the longest list length that she or he can recall correctly in the given order on at least half of all trials.   Prior to the creation of current memory models,  George Miller  argued that human short-term memory has a forward  memory span  of approximately seven items plus or minus two. [ 15 ]  More recent research has shown that this  magical number seven  is roughly accurate for college students recalling lists of digits, but memory span varies widely with populations tested and with material. For example, the ability to recall words in order depends on a number of characteristics of these words: fewer words can be recalled when the words have longer spoken duration; this is known as the  word-length effect , [ 16 ]  or when their speech sounds are similar to each other; this is called the  phonological similarity effect . [ 17 ]  More words can be recalled when the words are highly familiar and/or occur frequently in the language; [ 18 ]  recall performance is also better when all of the words in a list are taken from a single semantic category (such as sports) than when the words are taken from different categories. [ 19 ]     [ edit ]   Chunking   Chunking is the process in which we can expand our ability to remember things in short term. Chunking is also a process by which a person organize material into meaningful groups.Though the average person may only retain about 72 different units in his or her short term memory,  chunking  can greatly increase a person's recall ability. Through putting each unit into a meaningful word or phrase, a person's recall ability can skyrocket through practice. For example, in recalling a phone number, the person usually chunks the digits into three groups: first, the area code (such as 814), then a three-digit chunk (123) and lastly a four-digit chunk (4567). This method of remembering phone numbers is far more effective than attempting to remember a string of 10 digits. In one testing session, an All-American cross-country runner was able to recall a string of 79 digits after hearing them only once by chunking them into different running times (e.g. the first four numbers were 1518, a three-mile time.)

The duration of short-term memory (when rehearsal is prevented) is assumed to be in the order of seconds. Estimates of the capacity of short-term memory vary  from about 3 or 4 elements (i.e., words, digits, or letters) to about 9 elements. A commonly-cited capacity is  72  elements. In contrast,  long-term memory  indefinitely stores a seemingly unlimited amount of information.           Contents       1   Existence of a separate store   2   Broadbent's filter theory   3   Relationship to working memory   4   Duration of short-term memory   5   Capacity of short-term memory     5.1   Chunking       6   See also   7   References     7.1   Notes   7.2   Bibliography       8   External links               [ edit ]   Existence of a separate store   A classical model of memory developed in the 1960s assumed that all memories pass from a short-term to a long-term store after a small period of time. This model is referred to as the ""modal model"" and has been most famously detailed by  Atkinson  and  Shiffrin . [ 1 ]  The exact mechanisms by which this transfer takes place, whether all or only some memories are retained permanantly, and indeed the existence of a genuine distinction between the two stores, remain controversial topics among experts.   One form of evidence, cited in favor of the separate existence of a short-term store comes from  anterograde amnesia , the inability to learn new facts and episodes. Patients with this form of amnesia, typically caused by damage to the  hippocampus , have intact ability to retain small amounts of information over short time scales (up to 30 seconds) but are dramatically impaired in their ability to form longer-term memories (a famous example is  patient HM ). This is interpreted as showing that the short-term store is spared from amnesia.   Other evidence comes from experimental studies showing that some manipulations (e.g., a distractor task, such as repeatedly subtracting a single-digit number from a larger number following learning) impair memory for the 3 to 5 most recently learned words of a list (presumably still held in short-term memory), while leaving recall for words from earlier in the list (presumably stored in long-term memory) unaffected; other manipulations (e.g., semantic similarity of the words) affect only memory for earlier list words, [ 2 ]  but do not affect memory for the last few words in a list. These results show that different factors affect short term recall (disruption of rehearsal) and long-term recall (semantic similarity). Together, these findings show that long-term memory and short-term memory can vary independently of each other.   Not all researchers agree that short-term and long-term memory are separate systems. Some theorists propose that memory is unitary over all time scales, from milliseconds to years [ 3 ] . Support for the unitary memory hypothesis comes from the fact that it has been difficult to demarcate a clear boundary between short-term and long-term memory. For instance, Tarnow shows that the recall probability vs. latency curve is a straight line from 6 to 600 seconds, with the probability of failure to recall only saturating after 600 seconds  [ 4 ] . If there were really two different memory stores operating in this time frame, one could expect a discontinuity in this curve. Other research has shown that the detailed pattern of recall errors looks remarkably similar for recall of a list immediately after learning (presumably from short-term memory) and recall after 24 hours (necessarily from long-term memory) [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Broadbent's filter theory   Broadbent's theories of  selective attention  and  short-term memory  were developed as digital computers were beginning to become available to the academic community, and were among the first to use computer analogies to make a serious contribution to the analysis of human cognition. They were combined to form what became known as the ""single channel hypothesis"". His Filter Model proposed that the physical characteristics (e.g., pitch, loudness) of an auditorily presented message were used to focus attention to only a single message. Broadbent's Filter model is referred to as an  early selection  model because irrelevant messages are filtered out before the stimulus information is processed for meaning. These and other theories were brought together in his 1958 book ""Perception and Communication"" which remains one of the classic texts of cognitive psychology [ 6 ] .   Accounts for a theoretical filter device, which is located in , between the incoming sensory register, and the short-term memory storage. His theory is based upon the  multi-storage paradigm  of  William James (1890) and later the  Atkinson & Shiffrin's 'multi-store' memory model  (1968). This filter functions together with a buffer, and enables the subject to handle two kinds of stimuli, presented at the same time. One of the inputs is allowed through the filter, while the other is waiting in in the buffer for later processing. The filter prevents overloading of the limited capacity mechanism beyond the filter, which is the  short-term memory [ 7 ] . It is based on the famous cocktail party problem of the British scientist  Colin Cherry , who is trying to explain how we are able to focus our attention towards the  stimuli  which we find most interesting. [ 8 ] Broadbent comes up with the theory based on data from an experiment where three pairs of different digits are presented simultaneously, three digits in one ear and three in the other. Most participants recalled the digits ear by ear, rather than pair by pair. Thus, if 496 were presented to one ear and 852 to the other, the recall would be 496852 rather than 489562.     [ edit ]   Relationship to working memory   The relationship between short-term memory and  working memory  is differently described by various theorists, but it is generally acknowledged that the two concepts are distinct. Working memory is a theoretical framework that refers to structures and processes used for temporarily storing and manipulating information. As such, working memory might also be referred to as working attention. Short-term memory generally refers in a theory-neutral manner to the short term storage of information. Thus while there are short-term memory components to working memory models, the concept of short-term memory is distinct from these more hypothetical concepts. Within  Baddeley 's influential 1986 model of working memory there are two short-term storage mechanisms: the  phonological loop  and the  visuospatial sketchpad . Most of the research referred to here involves the phonological loop, because most of the work done on short-term memory has used verbal material. In recent years, however, there has been a surge in research on  visual short term memory [ 9 ] , and also increasing work on spatial short term memory [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   Duration of short-term memory   The most important characteristic of a short-term store is, clearly, that it is short-term  that is, it retains information for a limited amount of time only. Once information makes it past our sensory buffers, it passes into our short term memory, a second system for retaining information on our memories for brief periods of time. Most definitions of short-term memory limit the duration of storage to less than a minute; no more than about 30 seconds, and in some models as little as 2 seconds. Memory that exceeds short-term memory duration limits is regarded as long-term memory.   The limited duration of short-term memory immediately suggests that its contents spontaneously decay over time. The decay assumption is part of many theories of short-term memory, most notably  Baddeley's model of working memory . The decay assumption is usually paired with the idea of rapid  covert rehearsal : In order to overcome the limitation of short-term memory, and retain information for longer, information must be periodically repeated, or rehearsed  either by articulating it out loud, or by mentally simulating such articulation. In this way, the information will re-enter the short-term store and be retained for a further period.   Several researchers, however, dispute that spontaneous decay plays any significant role in forgetting over the short term  [ 11 ] [ 12 ] , and the evidence is far from conclusive [ 13 ] .   Authors doubting that decay causes forgetting from short-term memory often offer as an alternative some form of interference: When several elements (such as digits, words, or pictures) are held in short term memory simultaneously, their representations compete with each other for recall, or degrade each other. Thereby, new content gradually pushes out older content, unless the older content is actively protected against interference by rehearsal or by directing attention to it [ 14 ] .     [ edit ]   Capacity of short-term memory   Whatever the cause or causes of forgetting over the short term may be, there is consensus that it severely limits the amount of new information that we can retain over brief periods of time. This limit is referred to as the finite capacity of short-term memory. The capacity of short-term memory is often called ""memory span"", in reference to a common procedure of measuring it: The experimenter presents lists of items (e.g., digits or words) of increasing length; the tested person's span is determined as the longest list length that she or he can recall correctly in the given order on at least half of all trials.   Prior to the creation of current memory models,  George Miller  argued that human short-term memory has a forward  memory span  of approximately seven items plus or minus two. [ 15 ]  More recent research has shown that this  magical number seven  is roughly accurate for college students recalling lists of digits, but memory span varies widely with populations tested and with material. For example, the ability to recall words in order depends on a number of characteristics of these words: fewer words can be recalled when the words have longer spoken duration; this is known as the  word-length effect , [ 16 ]  or when their speech sounds are similar to each other; this is called the  phonological similarity effect . [ 17 ]  More words can be recalled when the words are highly familiar and/or occur frequently in the language; [ 18 ]  recall performance is also better when all of the words in a list are taken from a single semantic category (such as sports) than when the words are taken from different categories. [ 19 ]     [ edit ]   Chunking   Chunking is the process in which we can expand our ability to remember things in short term. Chunking is also a process by which a person organize material into meaningful groups.Though the average person may only retain about 72 different units in his or her short term memory,  chunking  can greatly increase a person's recall ability. Through putting each unit into a meaningful word or phrase, a person's recall ability can skyrocket through practice. For example, in recalling a phone number, the person usually chunks the digits into three groups: first, the area code (such as 814), then a three-digit chunk (123) and lastly a four-digit chunk (4567). This method of remembering phone numbers is far more effective than attempting to remember a string of 10 digits. In one testing session, an All-American cross-country runner was able to recall a string of 79 digits after hearing them only once by chunking them into different running times (e.g. the first four numbers were 1518, a three-mile time.)

clueweb09-en0000-27-01612	"  Euclid :   Euclid (fl. c. 300 BC, Alexandria), the most prominent mathematician of Greco-Roman antiquity, best known for his treatise on geometry, the Elements.    Life and work. Of Euclid's life it is known only that he taught at and founded a school at Alexandria in the time of Ptolemy I Soter, who reigned from 323 to 285/283 BC. Medieval translators and editors often confused him with the philosopher Eucleides of Megara, a contemporary of Plato about a century before, and therefore called him Megarensis. Writing in the 5th century AD, the Greek philosopher Proclus told the story of Euclid's reply to Ptolemy, who asked whether there was any shorter way in geometry than that of the Elements--""There is no royal road to geometry."" Another anecdote relates that a student, probably in Alexandria, after learning the very first proposition in geometry, wanted to know what he would get by learning these things, whereupon Euclid called his slave and said, ""Give him threepence since he must needs make gain by what he learns.""    Euclid compiled his Elements from a number of works of earlier men. Among these are Hippocrates of Chios (5th century BC), not to be confused with the physician Hippocrates of Cos (flourished 400 BC). The latest compiler before Euclid was Theudius, whose textbook was used in the Academy and was probably the one used by Aristotle. The older elements were at once superseded by Euclid's and then forgotten. For his subject matter Euclid doubtless drew upon all his predecessors, but it is clear that the whole design of his work was his own. He evidently altered the arrangement of the books, redistributed propositions among them and invented new proofs if the new order made the earlier proofs inapplicable. Thus, while Book X was mainly the work of the Pythagorean Theaetetus (flourished 369 BC), the proofs of several theorems in this book had to be changed in order to adapt them to the new definition of proportion developed by Eudoxus (q.v.). According to Proclus, Euclid incorporated into his work many discoveries of Eudoxus and Theaetetus. Most probably Books V and XII are the work of Eudoxus, X and XIII of Theaetetus. Book V expounds the very influential theory of proportion that is applicable to commensurable and incommensurable magnitudes alike (those whose ratios can be expressed as the quotient of two integers and those that cannot).  The main theorems of Book XII state that circles are to one another as the squares of their diameters and that spheres are to each other as the cubes of their diameters. These theorems are certainly the work of Eudoxus, who proved them with his ""method of exhaustion,"" by which he continuously subdivided a known magnitude until it approached the properties of an unknown. Book X deals with irrationals of different classes. Apart from some new proofs and additions, the contents of Book X are the work of Theaetetus; so is most of Book XIII, in which are described the five regular solids, earlier identified by the Pythagoreans. Euclid seems to have incorporated a finished treatise of Theaetetus on the regular solids into his Elements.  Book VII, dealing with the foundations of arithmetic, is a self-consistent treatise, written most probably before 400 BC.   Excerpt from the Encyclopedia Britannica without permission.    "

He was active in  Alexandria  during the reign of  Ptolemy I  (323 BC  283 BC). His work  Elements  is the most successful  textbook  in the  history of mathematics . [ 1 ] [ 2 ]  In it, the principles of what is now called  Euclidean geometry  were deduced from a small set of  axioms . Euclid also wrote works on  perspective ,  conic sections ,  spherical geometry ,  number theory  and  rigor .

The biographical information that we do have comes largely from commentaries by  Proclus  and  Pappus of Alexandria . Euclid was active at the great  Library of Alexandria  and may have studied at  Plato's Academy  in  Greece . The date and place of Euclid's birth and the date and circumstances of his death are unknown.   Some writers in the  Middle Ages  confused him with  Euclid of Megara , a Greek  Socratic   philosopher  who lived approximately one century earlier. [ 3 ]     The  Elements       Main article:  Euclid's Elements              One of the oldest surviving fragments of Euclid's  Elements , found at  Oxyrhynchus  and dated to circa AD 100. The diagram accompanies Book II, Proposition 5. [ 4 ]       Although many of the results in  Elements  originated with earlier mathematicians, one of Euclid's accomplishments was to present them in a single, logically coherent framework, making it easy to use and easy to reference, including a system of rigorous mathematical proofs that remains the basis of mathematics 23 centuries later. [ citation needed ]   Although best-known for its geometric results, the  Elements  also includes  number theory . It considers the connection between  perfect numbers  and  Mersenne primes , the infinitude of  prime numbers ,  Euclid's lemma  on factorization (which leads to the  fundamental theorem of arithmetic  on uniqueness of  prime factorizations ), and the  Euclidean algorithm  for finding the  greatest common divisor  of two numbers.   The geometrical system described in the  Elements  was long known simply as  geometry , and was considered to be the only geometry possible. Today, however, that system is often referred to as  Euclidean geometry  to distinguish it from other so-called  Non-Euclidean geometries  that mathematicians discovered in the 19th century.       Other works          Euclid, as imagined by  Raphael  in this detail from  The School of Athens . No likeness or description of Euclid's physical appearance made during his lifetime survived antiquity. Therefore, Euclid's depiction in works of art depends on the artist's imagination.       In addition to the  Elements , at least five works of Euclid have survived to the present day. They follow the same logical structure as  Elements , with definitions and proved propositions.     Data  deals with the nature and implications of ""given"" information in geometrical problems; the subject matter is closely related to the first four books of the  Elements .   On Divisions of Figures , which survives only partially in  Arabic  translation, concerns the division of geometrical figures into two or more equal parts or into parts in given  ratios . It is similar to a third century AD work by  Heron of Alexandria .   Catoptrics , which concerns the mathematical theory of mirrors, particularly the images formed in plane and spherical concave mirrors. The attribution to Euclid is doubtful. Its author may have been  Theon of Alexandria .   Phenomena , a treatise on  spherical astronomy , survives in Greek; it is quite similar to  On the Moving Sphere  by  Autolycus of Pitane , who flourished around 310 BC.   Optics  is the earliest surviving Greek treatise on perspective. In its definitions Euclid follows the Platonic tradition that vision is caused by discrete rays which emanate from the eye. One important definition is the fourth: ""Things seen under a greater angle appear greater, and those under a lesser angle less, while those under equal angles appear equal."" In the 36         Statue of Euclid in the  Oxford University Museum of Natural History      propositions that follow, Euclid relates the apparent size of an object to its distance from the eye and investigates the apparent shapes of cylinders and cones when viewed from different angles. Proposition 45 is interesting, proving that for any two unequal magnitudes, there is a point from which the two appear equal.  Pappus  believed these results to be important in astronomy and included Euclid's  Optics , along with his  Phaenomena , in the  Little Astronomy , a compendium of smaller works to be studied before the  Syntaxis  ( Almagest ) of  Claudius Ptolemy .     Other works are credibly attributed to Euclid, but have been lost.     Conics  was a work on  conic sections  that was later extended by  Apollonius of Perga  into his famous work on the subject. It is likely that the first four books of Apollonius's work come directly from Euclid. According to Pappus, ""Apollonius, having completed Euclid's four books of conics and added four others, handed down eight volumes of conics."" The Conics of Apollonius quickly supplanted the former work, and by the time of Pappus, Euclid's work was already lost.   Porisms  might have been an outgrowth of Euclid's work with conic sections, but the exact meaning of the title is controversial.   Pseudaria , or  Book of Fallacies , was an elementary text about errors in  reasoning .   Surface Loci  concerned either  loci  (sets of points) on surfaces or loci which were themselves surfaces; under the latter interpretation, it has been hypothesized that the work might have dealt with  quadric surfaces .   Several works on  mechanics  are attributed to Euclid by Arabic sources.  On the Heavy and the Light  contains, in nine definitions and five propositions, Aristotelian notions of moving bodies and the concept of specific gravity.  On the Balance  treats the theory of the lever in a similarly Euclidean manner, containing one definition, two axioms, and four propositions. A third fragment, on the circles described by the ends of a moving lever, contains four propositions. These three works complement each other in such a way that it has been suggested that they are remnants of a single treatise on mechanics written by Euclid.

Euclid's Algorithm       Also found in:  Wikipedia  0.06 sec.         (algorithm) Euclid's Algorithm  - (Or ""Euclidean Algorithm"") An  algorithm  for finding the  greatest common divisor  (GCD) of two numbers. It relies on the identity gcd(a, b) = gcd(a-b, b) To find the GCD of two numbers by this algorithm, repeatedly replace the larger by subtracting the smaller from it until the two numbers are equal.  E.g. 132, 168 -> 132, 36 -> 96, 36 -> 60, 36 -> 24, 36 -> 24, 12 -> 12, 12 so the GCD of 132 and 168 is 12. This algorithm requires only subtraction and comparison operations but can take a number of steps proportional to the difference between the initial numbers (e.g. gcd(1, 1001) will take 1000 steps).

The duration of short-term memory (when rehearsal is prevented) is assumed to be in the order of seconds. Estimates of the capacity of short-term memory vary  from about 3 or 4 elements (i.e., words, digits, or letters) to about 9 elements. A commonly-cited capacity is  72  elements. In contrast,  long-term memory  indefinitely stores a seemingly unlimited amount of information.

This model is referred to as the ""modal model"" and has been most famously detailed by  Atkinson  and  Shiffrin . [ 1 ]  The exact mechanisms by which this transfer takes place, whether all or only some memories are retained permanantly, and indeed the existence of a genuine distinction between the two stores, remain controversial topics among experts.   One form of evidence, cited in favor of the separate existence of a short-term store comes from  anterograde amnesia , the inability to learn new facts and episodes. Patients with this form of amnesia, typically caused by damage to the  hippocampus , have intact ability to retain small amounts of information over short time scales (up to 30 seconds) but are dramatically impaired in their ability to form longer-term memories (a famous example is  patient HM ). This is interpreted as showing that the short-term store is spared from amnesia.   Other evidence comes from experimental studies showing that some manipulations (e.g., a distractor task, such as repeatedly subtracting a single-digit number from a larger number following learning) impair memory for the 3 to 5 most recently learned words of a list (presumably still held in short-term memory), while leaving recall for words from earlier in the list (presumably stored in long-term memory) unaffected; other manipulations (e.g., semantic similarity of the words) affect only memory for earlier list words, [ 2 ]  but do not affect memory for the last few words in a list. These results show that different factors affect short term recall (disruption of rehearsal) and long-term recall (semantic similarity). Together, these findings show that long-term memory and short-term memory can vary independently of each other.   Not all researchers agree that short-term and long-term memory are separate systems. Some theorists propose that memory is unitary over all time scales, from milliseconds to years [ 3 ] . Support for the unitary memory hypothesis comes from the fact that it has been difficult to demarcate a clear boundary between short-term and long-term memory. For instance, Tarnow shows that the recall probability vs. latency curve is a straight line from 6 to 600 seconds, with the probability of failure to recall only saturating after 600 seconds  [ 4 ] . If there were really two different memory stores operating in this time frame, one could expect a discontinuity in this curve. Other research has shown that the detailed pattern of recall errors looks remarkably similar for recall of a list immediately after learning (presumably from short-term memory) and recall after 24 hours (necessarily from long-term memory) [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Broadbent's filter theory   Broadbent's theories of  selective attention  and  short-term memory  were developed as digital computers were beginning to become available to the academic community, and were among the first to use computer analogies to make a serious contribution to the analysis of human cognition. They were combined to form what became known as the ""single channel hypothesis"". His Filter Model proposed that the physical characteristics (e.g., pitch, loudness) of an auditorily presented message were used to focus attention to only a single message. Broadbent's Filter model is referred to as an  early selection  model because irrelevant messages are filtered out before the stimulus information is processed for meaning. These and other theories were brought together in his 1958 book ""Perception and Communication"" which remains one of the classic texts of cognitive psychology [ 6 ] .   Accounts for a theoretical filter device, which is located in , between the incoming sensory register, and the short-term memory storage. His theory is based upon the  multi-storage paradigm  of  William James (1890) and later the  Atkinson & Shiffrin's 'multi-store' memory model  (1968). This filter functions together with a buffer, and enables the subject to handle two kinds of stimuli, presented at the same time. One of the inputs is allowed through the filter, while the other is waiting in in the buffer for later processing. The filter prevents overloading of the limited capacity mechanism beyond the filter, which is the  short-term memory [ 7 ] . It is based on the famous cocktail party problem of the British scientist  Colin Cherry , who is trying to explain how we are able to focus our attention towards the  stimuli  which we find most interesting. [ 8 ] Broadbent comes up with the theory based on data from an experiment where three pairs of different digits are presented simultaneously, three digits in one ear and three in the other. Most participants recalled the digits ear by ear, rather than pair by pair. Thus, if 496 were presented to one ear and 852 to the other, the recall would be 496852 rather than 489562.     [ edit ]   Relationship to working memory   The relationship between short-term memory and  working memory  is differently described by various theorists, but it is generally acknowledged that the two concepts are distinct. Working memory is a theoretical framework that refers to structures and processes used for temporarily storing and manipulating information. As such, working memory might also be referred to as working attention. Short-term memory generally refers in a theory-neutral manner to the short term storage of information. Thus while there are short-term memory components to working memory models, the concept of short-term memory is distinct from these more hypothetical concepts. Within  Baddeley 's influential 1986 model of working memory there are two short-term storage mechanisms: the  phonological loop  and the  visuospatial sketchpad . Most of the research referred to here involves the phonological loop, because most of the work done on short-term memory has used verbal material. In recent years, however, there has been a surge in research on  visual short term memory [ 9 ] , and also increasing work on spatial short term memory [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   Duration of short-term memory   The most important characteristic of a short-term store is, clearly, that it is short-term  that is, it retains information for a limited amount of time only. Once information makes it past our sensory buffers, it passes into our short term memory, a second system for retaining information on our memories for brief periods of time. Most definitions of short-term memory limit the duration of storage to less than a minute; no more than about 30 seconds, and in some models as little as 2 seconds. Memory that exceeds short-term memory duration limits is regarded as long-term memory.   The limited duration of short-term memory immediately suggests that its contents spontaneously decay over time. The decay assumption is part of many theories of short-term memory, most notably  Baddeley's model of working memory . The decay assumption is usually paired with the idea of rapid  covert rehearsal : In order to overcome the limitation of short-term memory, and retain information for longer, information must be periodically repeated, or rehearsed  either by articulating it out loud, or by mentally simulating such articulation. In this way, the information will re-enter the short-term store and be retained for a further period.   Several researchers, however, dispute that spontaneous decay plays any significant role in forgetting over the short term  [ 11 ] [ 12 ] , and the evidence is far from conclusive [ 13 ] .   Authors doubting that decay causes forgetting from short-term memory often offer as an alternative some form of interference: When several elements (such as digits, words, or pictures) are held in short term memory simultaneously, their representations compete with each other for recall, or degrade each other. Thereby, new content gradually pushes out older content, unless the older content is actively protected against interference by rehearsal or by directing attention to it [ 14 ] .     [ edit ]   Capacity of short-term memory   Whatever the cause or causes of forgetting over the short term may be, there is consensus that it severely limits the amount of new information that we can retain over brief periods of time. This limit is referred to as the finite capacity of short-term memory. The capacity of short-term memory is often called ""memory span"", in reference to a common procedure of measuring it: The experimenter presents lists of items (e.g., digits or words) of increasing length; the tested person's span is determined as the longest list length that she or he can recall correctly in the given order on at least half of all trials.   Prior to the creation of current memory models,  George Miller  argued that human short-term memory has a forward  memory span  of approximately seven items plus or minus two. [ 15 ]  More recent research has shown that this  magical number seven  is roughly accurate for college students recalling lists of digits, but memory span varies widely with populations tested and with material. For example, the ability to recall words in order depends on a number of characteristics of these words: fewer words can be recalled when the words have longer spoken duration; this is known as the  word-length effect , [ 16 ]  or when their speech sounds are similar to each other; this is called the  phonological similarity effect . [ 17 ]  More words can be recalled when the words are highly familiar and/or occur frequently in the language; [ 18 ]  recall performance is also better when all of the words in a list are taken from a single semantic category (such as sports) than when the words are taken from different categories. [ 19 ]     [ edit ]   Chunking   Chunking is the process in which we can expand our ability to remember things in short term. Chunking is also a process by which a person organize material into meaningful groups.Though the average person may only retain about 72 different units in his or her short term memory,  chunking  can greatly increase a person's recall ability. Through putting each unit into a meaningful word or phrase, a person's recall ability can skyrocket through practice. For example, in recalling a phone number, the person usually chunks the digits into three groups: first, the area code (such as 814), then a three-digit chunk (123) and lastly a four-digit chunk (4567). This method of remembering phone numbers is far more effective than attempting to remember a string of 10 digits. In one testing session, an All-American cross-country runner was able to recall a string of 79 digits after hearing them only once by chunking them into different running times (e.g. the first four numbers were 1518, a three-mile time.)

The long lasting nature of  The Elements  must make Euclid the leading mathematics teacher of all time. However little is known of Euclid's life except that he taught at Alexandria in Egypt. Proclus, the last major Greek philosopher, who lived around 450 AD wrote: Not much younger than these  [ pupils of  Plato]  is Euclid, who put together the ""Elements"", arranging in order many of  Eudoxus 's theorems, perfecting many of  Theaetetus 's, and also bringing to irrefutable demonstration the things which had been only loosely proved by his predecessors. This man lived in the time of the first Ptolemy; for  Archimedes , who followed closely upon the first Ptolemy makes mention of Euclid, and further they say that Ptolemy once asked him if there were a shorted way to study geometry than the Elements, to which he replied that there was no royal road to geometry. He is therefore younger than  Plato 's circle, but older than  Eratosthenes  and  Archimedes ; for these were contemporaries, as  Eratosthenes  somewhere says. In his aim he was a Platonist, being in sympathy with this philosophy, whence he made the end of the whole ""Elements"" the construction of the so-called Platonic figures.   There is other information about Euclid given by certain authors but it is not thought to be reliable. Two different types of this extra information exists. The first type of extra information is that given by Arabian authors who state that Euclid was the son of Naucrates and that he was born in Tyre. It is believed by historians of mathematics that this is entirely fictitious and was merely invented by the authors.  The second type of information is that Euclid was born at Megara. This is due to an error on the part of the authors who first gave this information. In fact there was a Euclid of Megara, who was a philosopher who lived about 100 years before the mathematician Euclid of Alexandria. It is not quite the coincidence that it might seem that there were two learned men called Euclid. In fact Euclid was a very common name around this period and this is one further complication that makes it difficult to discover information concerning Euclid of Alexandria since there are references to numerous men called Euclid in the literature of this period.  Returning to the quotation from Proclus given above, the first point to make is that there is nothing inconsistent in the dating given. However, although we do not know for certain exactly what reference to Euclid in Archimedes' work Proclus is referring to, in what has come down to us there is only one reference to Euclid and this occurs in  On the sphere and the cylinder.  The obvious conclusion, therefore, is that all is well with the argument of Proclus and this was assumed until challenged by Hjelmslev in [48]. He argued that the reference to Euclid was added to Archimedes book at a later stage, and indeed it is a rather surprising reference. It was not the tradition of the time to give such references, moreover there are many other places in Archimedes where it would be appropriate to refer to Euclid and there is no such reference. Despite Hjelmslev's claims that the passage has been added later, Bulmer-Thomas writes in: Although it is no longer possible to rely on this reference, a general consideration of Euclid's works ... still shows that he must have written after such pupils of  Plato  as  Eudoxus  and before  Archimedes.  For further discussion on dating Euclid, see for example [8]. This is far from an end to the arguments about Euclid the mathematician. The situation is best summed up by Itard [11] who gives three possible hypotheses. (i) Euclid was an historical character who wrote the  Elements  and the other works attributed to him.  (ii) Euclid was the leader of a team of mathematicians working at Alexandria. They all contributed to writing the 'complete works of Euclid', even continuing to write books under Euclid's name after his death.  (iii) Euclid was not an historical character. The 'complete works of Euclid' were written by a team of mathematicians at Alexandria who took the name Euclid from the historical character Euclid of Megara who had lived about 100 years earlier.  It is worth remarking that Itard, who accepts Hjelmslev's claims that the passage about Euclid was added to Archimedes, favours the second of the three possibilities that we listed above. We should, however, make some comments on the three possibilities which, it is fair to say, sum up pretty well all possible current theories.  There is some strong evidence to accept (i). It was accepted without question by everyone for over 2000 years and there is little evidence which is inconsistent with this hypothesis. It is true that there are differences in style between some of the books of the  Elements  yet many authors vary their style. Again the fact that Euclid undoubtedly based the  Elements  on previous works means that it would be rather remarkable if no trace of the style of the original author remained.  Even if we accept (i) then there is little doubt that Euclid built up a vigorous school of mathematics at Alexandria. He therefore would have had some able pupils who may have helped out in writing the books. However hypothesis (ii) goes much further than this and would suggest that different books were written by different mathematicians. Other than the differences in style referred to above, there is little direct evidence of this.  Although on the face of it (iii) might seem the most fanciful of the three suggestions, nevertheless the 20th century example of Bourbaki shows that it is far from impossible. Henri Cartan, Andr Weil, Jean Dieudonn, Claude Chevalley, and Alexander Grothendieck wrote collectively under the name of Bourbaki and Bourbaki's  Elments de mathmatique  contains more than 30 volumes. Of course if (iii) were the correct hypothesis then Apollonius, who studied with the pupils of Euclid in Alexandria, must have known there was no person 'Euclid' but the fact that he wrote: .... Euclid did not work out the syntheses of the locus with respect to three and four lines, but only a chance portion of it ...   certainly does not prove that Euclid was an historical character since there are many similar references to Bourbaki by mathematicians who knew perfectly well that Bourbaki was fictitious. Nevertheless the mathematicians who made up the Bourbaki team are all well known in their own right and this may be the greatest argument against hypothesis (iii) in that the 'Euclid team' would have to have consisted of outstanding mathematicians. So who were they?  We shall assume in this article that hypothesis (i) is true but, having no knowledge of Euclid, we must concentrate on his works after making a few comments on possible historical events. Euclid must have studied in Plato's Academy in Athens to have learnt of the geometry of Eudoxus and Theaetetus of which he was so familiar.  None of Euclid's works have a preface, at least none has come down to us so it is highly unlikely that any ever existed, so we cannot see any of his character, as we can of some other Greek mathematicians, from the nature of their prefaces. Pappus writes (see for example [1]) that Euclid was:  ... most fair and well disposed towards all who were able in any measure to advance mathematics, careful in no way to give offence, and although an exact scholar not vaunting himself.   Some claim these words have been added to Pappus, and certainly the point of the passage (in a continuation which we have not quoted) is to speak harshly (and almost certainly unfairly) of Apollonius. The picture of Euclid drawn by Pappus is, however, certainly in line with the evidence from his mathematical texts. Another story told by Stobaeus [9] is the following: ... someone who had begun to learn geometry with Euclid, when he had learnt the first theorem, asked Euclid ""What shall I get by learning these things?"" Euclid called his slave and said ""Give him threepence since he must make gain out of what he learns"".   Euclid's most famous work is his treatise on mathematics  The Elements . The book was a compilation of knowledge that became the centre of mathematical teaching for 2000 years. Probably no results in  The Elements  were first proved by Euclid but the organisation of the material and its exposition are certainly due to him. In fact there is ample evidence that Euclid is using earlier textbooks as he writes the  Elements  since he introduces quite a number of definitions which are never used such as that of an oblong, a rhombus, and a rhomboid.  The  Elements  begins with definitions and five postulates. The first three postulates are postulates of construction, for example the first postulate states that it is possible to draw a straight line between any two points. These postulates also implicitly assume the existence of points, lines and circles and then the existence of other geometric objects are deduced from the fact that these exist. There are other assumptions in the postulates which are not explicit. For example it is assumed that there is a unique line joining any two points. Similarly postulates two and three, on producing straight lines and drawing circles, respectively, assume the uniqueness of the objects the possibility of whose construction is being postulated.  The fourth and fifth postulates are of a different nature. Postulate four states that all right angles are equal. This may seem ""obvious"" but it actually assumes that space in homogeneous - by this we mean that a figure will be independent of the position in space in which it is placed. The famous fifth, or parallel, postulate states that one and only one line can be drawn through a point parallel to a given line. Euclid's decision to make this a postulate led to Euclidean geometry. It was not until the 19th century that this postulate was dropped and non-euclidean geometries were studied.  There are also axioms which Euclid calls 'common notions'. These are not specific geometrical properties but rather general assumptions which allow mathematics to proceed as a deductive science. For example: Things which are equal to the same thing are equal to each other.   Zeno of Sidon, about 250 years after Euclid wrote the  Elements , seems to have been the first to show that Euclid's propositions were not deduced from the postulates and axioms alone, and Euclid does make other subtle assumptions.  The  Elements  is divided into 13 books. Books one to six deal with plane geometry. In particular books one and two set out basic properties of triangles, parallels, parallelograms, rectangles and squares. Book three studies properties of the circle while book four deals with problems about circles and is thought largely to set out work of the followers of Pythagoras. Book five lays out the work of Eudoxus on proportion applied to commensurable and incommensurable magnitudes. Heath says: Greek mathematics can boast no finer discovery than this theory, which put on a sound footing so much of geometry as depended on the use of proportion.   Book six looks at applications of the results of book five to plane geometry.  Books seven to nine deal with number theory. In particular book seven is a self-contained introduction to number theory and contains the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers. Book eight looks at numbers in geometrical progression but van der Waerden writes in that it contains:  ... cumbersome enunciations, needless repetitions, and even logical fallacies. Apparently Euclid's exposition excelled only in those parts in which he had excellent sources at his disposal.   Book ten deals with the theory of irrational numbers and is mainly the work of Theaetetus. Euclid changed the proofs of several theorems in this book so that they fitted the new definition of proportion given by Eudoxus.  Books eleven to thirteen deal with three-dimensional geometry. In book thirteen the basic definitions needed for the three books together are given. The theorems then follow a fairly similar pattern to the two-dimensional analogues previously given in books one and four. The main results of book twelve are that circles are to one another as the squares of their diameters and that spheres are to each other as the cubes of their diameters. These results are certainly due to Eudoxus. Euclid proves these theorems using the ""method of exhaustion"" as invented by Eudoxus. The  Elements  ends with book thirteen which discusses the properties of the five regular polyhedra and gives a proof that there are precisely five. This book appears to be based largely on an earlier treatise by Theaetetus.  Euclid's  Elements  is remarkable for the clarity with which the theorems are stated and proved. The standard of rigour was to become a goal for the inventors of the calculus centuries later. As Heath writes in: This wonderful book, with all its imperfections, which are indeed slight enough when account is taken of the date it appeared, is and will doubtless remain the greatest mathematical textbook of all time. ... Even in Greek times the most accomplished mathematicians occupied themselves with it:  Heron, Pappus, Porphyry, Proclus  and  Simplicius  wrote commentaries;  Theon  of Alexandria re-edited it, altering the language here and there, mostly with a view to greater clearness and consistency...   It is a fascinating story how the  Elements  has survived from Euclid's time and this is told well by Fowler in [7]. He describes the earliest material relating to the  Elements  which has survived: Our earliest glimpse of Euclidean material will be the most remarkable for a thousand years, six fragmentary ostraca containing text and a figure ... found on Elephantine Island in  1906/07  and  1907/08 ... These texts are early, though still more than  100  years after the death of  Plato ( they are dated on palaeographic grounds to the third quarter of the third century BC ) ; advanced  ( they deal with the results found in the ""Elements""  [ book thirteen ]  ... on the pentagon, hexagon, decagon, and icosahedron ) ; and they do not follow the text of the Elements. ... So they give evidence of someone in the third century BC, located more than  500  miles south of Alexandria, working through this difficult material... this may be an attempt to understand the mathematics, and not a slavish copying ...   The next fragment that we have dates from 75 - 125 AD and again appears to be notes by someone trying to understand the material of the  Elements.   More than one thousand editions of  The Elements  have been published since it was first printed in 1482. Heath discusses many of the editions and describes the likely changes to the text over the years.  B L van der Waerden assesses the importance of the  Elements  in:  Almost from the time of its writing and lasting almost to the present, the Elements has exerted a continuous and major influence on human affairs. It was the primary source of geometric reasoning, theorems, and methods at least until the advent of non-Euclidean geometry in the  19 th century. It is sometimes said that, next to the Bible, the ""Elements"" may be the most translated, published, and studied of all the books produced in the Western world.   Euclid also wrote the following books which have survived:  Data  (with 94 propositions), which looks at what properties of figures can be deduced when other properties are given;  On Divisions  which looks at constructions to divide a figure into two parts with areas of given ratio;  Optics  which is the first Greek work on perspective; and  Phaenomena  which is an elementary introduction to mathematical astronomy and gives results on the times stars in certain positions will rise and set. Euclid's following books have all been lost:  Surface Loci  (two books),  Porisms  (a three book work with, according to Pappus, 171 theorems and 38 lemmas),  Conics  (four books),  Book of Fallacies  and  Elements of Music.  The  Book of Fallacies  is described by Proclus: Since many things seem to conform with the truth and to follow from scientific principles, but lead astray from the principles and deceive the more superficial,  [ Euclid ]  has handed down methods for the clear-sighted understanding of these matters also ... The treatise in which he gave this machinery to us is entitled Fallacies, enumerating in order the various kinds, exercising our intelligence in each case by theorems of all sorts, setting the true side by side with the false, and combining the refutation of the error with practical illustration.   Elements of Music  is a work which is attributed to Euclid by Proclus. We have two treatises on music which have survived, and have by some authors attributed to Euclid, but it is now thought that they are not the work on music referred to by Proclus.  Euclid may not have been a first class mathematician but the long lasting nature of  The Elements  must make him the leading mathematics teacher of antiquity or perhaps of all time. As a final personal note let me add that my [EFR] own introduction to mathematics at school in the 1950s was from an edition of part of Euclid's  Elements  and the work provided a logical basis for mathematics and the concept of proof which seem to be lacking in school mathematics today.  The picture of Euclid which we give above is from the 18th century and must be regarded as entirely fanciful.

It's not a work of art, but here goes*:     Euclid  of Alexandria             is one of the most important and influential mathematicians in history.             Living in ancient Alexandria, he wrote  The Elements , a geometry textbook             used in some places until the twentieth century. His work in geometry             provided the foundation on which all future mathematicians were educated.      For a man of such              great significance to the world of mathematics, little is known about              his actual life. Euclid is thought to have lived from 325-265 BC, mostly              in Alexandria. He was taught at The Academy in Athens, founded by Plato,              and probably tutored another great mathematician, Archimedes. Euclid              also founded a great mathematics school in Alexandria. Little was ever              written about Euclid, and the available information is scarce and of              questionable accuracy. Much of the information we do have is from authors              like Proclus who lived centuries later, writing about his books, not              his life.      If little has ever               been made of Euclid's life, then the opposite is true of his book. The               Elements was used as the primary geometry resource for over 2000 years,               and his lessons could still be used today. Although it contains 13 volumes,               much of the work may not be Euclid's. Some of the chapters seem to be               written with different styles, and others are geared for different ages,               leading one to believe that he inserted other mathematicians' work into               his own.      Each volume begins with pages of definitions and postulates, followed                by his theorems. Euclid then proves each one of his theorems using the                definitions and postulates, mathematically proving even the most obvious.                His work was translated into Latin and Arabic, and was first printed                in mass quantity in 1482, ten years before Columbus, but 1800 years                AFTER it was written! From that point until the early 1900's, The Elements                was considered by far the best geometry textbook in the world.     Although he may                not have written The Elements entirely on his own, his other works are                certainly his alone. Those include Data, Optics, Phaenomena, and On                Division of Figures. His work in Data is probably the most famous of                his smaller works, and focuses on finding certain measurements and quantities                when others are given. Phaenomena is about planetary motions and Optics                about perspectives. In Optics, Euclid attempts to prove the common belief                of the time that sight was created by rays coming from the eye, rather                than light entering the eye.     Euclid was apparently                 a kind, patient man, and did possess a sarcastic sense of humor. In                 fact, King Ptolemy once asked Euclid if there was an easier way to study                 math than learning all the theorems. Euclid then replied, ""There                 is no royal road to geometry,"" and sent one of the most powerful                 kings of his time off to study. On another occasion, a student of his                 questioned the value of learning geometry, much like students today.                 Euclid responded by giving the small child a coin, saying that ""he                 must make gain out of what he learns.""     There are many other                  works of Euclid which appear to be lost to time, but his primary work                  in The Elements is what made him famous. His work in geometry led to                  discovery after discovery in history, and provided the basis for mathematical                  education for 2000 years. While students no longer read directly from                  his writing, the textbooks of today are still based on Euclidean proofs                  and theorems. Perhaps it is fitting, then, that Euclid is called ""The                  Father of Geometry.""      Sources:      1.

In  geometry , the  parallel postulate , also called  Euclid 's fifth postulate  because it is the fifth postulate in  Euclid's  Elements , is a distinctive  axiom  in what is now called  Euclidean geometry . It states that:     If a  line segment  intersects two straight  lines  forming two interior angles on the same side that sum to less than two  right angles , then the two lines, if extended indefinitely, meet on that side on which the angles sum to less than two right angles.     Euclidean geometry  is the study of geometry that satisfies all of Euclid's axioms,  including  the parallel postulate. A geometry where the parallel postulate cannot hold is known as a  non-euclidean geometry . Geometry that is  independent  of Euclid's fifth postulate (i.e., only assumes the first four postulates) is known as  absolute geometry  (or, in other places known as neutral geometry).           Contents       1   Converse of Euclid's parallel postulate   2   Logically equivalent properties   3   History   4   Criticism   5   See also   6   References   7   Further reading               [ edit ]   Converse of Euclid's parallel postulate          If the sum of the two interior angles equals 180, the lines are parallel and will never intersect.       Euclid did not postulate the  converse  of his fifth postulate, which is one way to distinguish Euclidean geometry from  elliptic geometry . The Elements contains the proof of an equivalent statement (Book I, Proposition 17):  Any two  angles  of a  triangle  are together less than two  right angles .  The proof depends on an earlier proposition:  In a triangle ABC, the  exterior angle  at C is greater than either of the  interior angles  A or B . This in turn depends on Euclid's unstated assumption that two straight lines meet in only one point, a statement not true of elliptic geometry.   In other words, the converse of the fifth postulate follows from Euclid's axioms minus the fifth postulate, plus an axiom stating that two distinct non-parallel straight lines meet in only one point.     [ edit ]   Logically equivalent properties   Euclid's parallel postulate is equivalent to Playfair's axiom, named after the Scottish  mathematician   John Playfair , which states:     At most one line can be drawn through any point not on a given line  parallel  to the given line in a plane. [ 1 ]     Many other equivalent statements to the parallel postulate or to Playfair's axiom have been suggested, some of them appearing at first to be unrelated to parallelism, and some seeming so  self-evident  that they were  unconsciously  assumed by people who claimed to have proven the parallel postulate from Euclid's other postulates.     The sum of the  angles  in every  triangle  is 180.   There exists a triangle whose angles add up to 180.   The sum of the angles is the same for every triangle.   There exists a pair of  similar , but not  congruent , triangles.   Every triangle can be  circumscribed .   If three angles of a  quadrilateral  are  right angles , then the fourth angle is also a right angle.   There exists a quadrilateral of which all angles are right angles.   There exists a pair of straight lines that are at constant  distance  from each other.   Two lines that are parallel to the same line are also parallel to each other.   Given two parallel lines, any line that intersects one of them also intersects the other.   In a  right-angled triangle , the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides ( Pythagoras' Theorem ).   There is no upper limit to the  area  of a triangle.  [1]     However, the alternatives which employ the word ""parallel"" cease appearing so simple when one is obliged to explain which of the three common definitions of ""parallel"" is meant - constant separation, never meeting or same angles where crossed by a third line - since the equivalence of these three is itself one of the unconsciously obvious assumptions equivalent to Euclid's fifth postulate.     [ edit ]   History   For two thousand years, many attempts were made to prove the parallel postulate using Euclid's first four postulates. The main reason that such a proof was so highly sought after was that the fifth postulate isn't self-evident unlike the other postulates. If the order the postulates were listed in the Elements is significant, it indicates that Euclid included this postulate only when he realised he could not prove it or proceed without it. [ 2 ]   Ibn al-Haytham  (Alhazen) (965-1039), an  Iraqi mathematician , made the first attempt at proving the parallel postulate using a  proof by contradiction , [ 3 ]  where he introduced the concept of  motion  and  transformation  into geometry. [ 4 ]  He formulated the  Lambert quadrilateral , which Boris Abramovich Rozenfeld names the ""Ibn al-HaythamLambert quadrilateral"", [ 5 ]  and his attempted proof also shows similarities to  Playfair's axiom . [ 6 ]   Omar Khayym  (1050-1123) made the first attempt at formulating a non-Euclidean  postulate  as an alternative to the parallel postulate, [ 7 ]  and he was the first to consider the cases of  elliptical geometry  and  hyperbolic geometry , though he excluded the latter. [ 8 ]  The  Khayyam-Saccheri quadrilateral  was also first considered by Omar Khayyam in the late 11th century in Book I of  Explanations of the Difficulties in the Postulates of Euclid . [ 5 ]  Unlike many commentators on Euclid before and after him (including  Giovanni Girolamo Saccheri ), Khayyam was not trying to prove the parallel postulate as such but to derive it from an equivalent postulate: ""Two convergent straight lines intersect and it is impossible for two convergent straight lines to diverge in the direction in which they converge."" [ 9 ]  He recognized that three possibilities arose from omitting Euclid's Fifth; if two perpendiculars to one line cross another line, judicious choice of the last can make the internal angles where it meets the two perpendiculars equal (it is then parallel to the first line). If those equal internal angles are right angles, we get Euclid's Fifth; otherwise, they must be either acute or obtuse. He persuaded himself that the acute and obtuse cases lead to contradiction, but had made a tacit assumption equivalent to the fifth to get there.   Nasir al-Din al-Tusi  (1201-1274), in his  Al-risala al-shafiya'an al-shakk fi'l-khutut al-mutawaziya  ( Discussion Which Removes Doubt about Parallel Lines ) (1250), wrote detailed critiques of the parallel postulate and on Khayym's attempted proof a century earlier. Nasir al-Din attempted to derive a proof by contradiction of the parallel postulate. [ 10 ]  He was also one of the first to consider the cases of elliptical geometry and hyperbolic geometry, though he ruled out both of them. [ 8 ]          Euclidean, elliptical and hyperbolic geometry. The Parallel Postulate is satisfied only for models of Euclidean geometry.       Nasir al-Din's son, Sadr al-Din (sometimes known as ""Pseudo-Tusi""), wrote a book on the subject in 1298, based on Nasir al-Din's later thoughts, which presented one of the earliest arguments for a non-Euclidean hypothesis equivalent to the parallel postulate. ""He essentially revised both the Euclidean system of axioms and postulates and the proofs of many propositions from the  Elements ."" [ 10 ] [ 11 ]  His work was published in  Rome  in 1594 and was studied by European geometers. This work marked the starting point for Saccheri's work on the subject. [ 10 ]   Giordano Vitale  (1633-1711), in his book  Euclide restituo  (1680, 1686), used the Khayyam-Saccheri quadrilateral to prove that if three points are equidistant on the base AB and the summit CD, then AB and CD are everywhere equidistant.  Girolamo Saccheri  (1667-1733) pursued the same line of reasoning more thoroughly, correctly obtaining absurdity from the obtuse case (proceeding, like Euclid, from the implicit assumption that lines can be extended indefinitely and have infinite length), but failing to debunk the acute case (although he managed to wrongly persuade himself that he had).   Where Khayym and Saccheri had attempted to prove Euclid's fifth by disproving the only possible alternatives, the nineteenth century finally saw mathematicians exploring those alternatives and discovering the  logically consistent  geometries which result. In 1829,  Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky  published an account of acute geometry in an obscure Russian journal (later re-published in 1840 in German). In 1831,  Jnos Bolyai  included, in a book by his father, an appendix describing acute geometry, which, doubtlessly, he had developed independently of Lobachevsky.  Carl Friedrich Gauss  had actually studied the problem before that, but he did not publish any of his results. However, upon hearing of Boylai's results in a letter from Bolyai's father,  Farkas Bolyai , he stated:     ""If I commenced by saying that I am unable to praise this work, you would certainly be surprised for a moment. But I cannot say otherwise. To praise it would be to praise myself. Indeed the whole contents of the work, the path taken by your son, the results to which he is led, coincide almost entirely with my meditations, which have occupied my mind partly for the last thirty or thirty-five years."" [ 12 ]     The resulting geometries were later developed by  Lobachevsky ,  Riemann  and  Poincar  into  hyperbolic geometry  (the acute case) and  spherical geometry  (the obtuse case). The  independence  of the parallel postulate from Euclid's other axioms was finally demonstrated by  Eugenio Beltrami  in 1868.     [ edit ]   Criticism   Attempts to logically prove this postulate, rather than the eighth axiom, were criticized by  Schopenhauer , as described in  Schopenhauer's criticism of the proofs of the Parallel Postulate .

In  geometry , the  parallel postulate , also called  Euclid 's fifth postulate  because it is the fifth postulate in  Euclid's  Elements , is a distinctive  axiom  in what is now called  Euclidean geometry . It states that:     If a  line segment  intersects two straight  lines  forming two interior angles on the same side that sum to less than two  right angles , then the two lines, if extended indefinitely, meet on that side on which the angles sum to less than two right angles.     Euclidean geometry  is the study of geometry that satisfies all of Euclid's axioms,  including  the parallel postulate. A geometry where the parallel postulate cannot hold is known as a  non-euclidean geometry . Geometry that is  independent  of Euclid's fifth postulate (i.e., only assumes the first four postulates) is known as  absolute geometry  (or, in other places known as neutral geometry).

Euclid did not postulate the  converse  of his fifth postulate, which is one way to distinguish Euclidean geometry from  elliptic geometry . The Elements contains the proof of an equivalent statement (Book I, Proposition 17):  Any two  angles  of a  triangle  are together less than two  right angles .  The proof depends on an earlier proposition:  In a triangle ABC, the  exterior angle  at C is greater than either of the  interior angles  A or B . This in turn depends on Euclid's unstated assumption that two straight lines meet in only one point, a statement not true of elliptic geometry.   In other words, the converse of the fifth postulate follows from Euclid's axioms minus the fifth postulate, plus an axiom stating that two distinct non-parallel straight lines meet in only one point.     [ edit ]   Logically equivalent properties   It is often stated that Euclid's parallel postulate is equivalent to Playfair's axiom, named after the Scottish  mathematician   John Playfair , which states:     Exactly one line can be drawn through any point not on a given line  parallel  to the given line in a plane. [ 1 ]     However this can be seen to be false because Euclid's parallel postulate is not inconsistent with elliptical geometry; two lines in an elliptical space intersected by a third line, forming two interior angles on one side with a sum less than two right angles, will meet on that side. That they meet on the other side as well does not contradict the parallel postulate. Playfair's axiom excludes this possibility by assuming that at least one parallel line through a given point does exist, which Euclid wrongly believed could be proven from his other postulates (Elements, Book 1 Proposition 31).   Many other equivalent statements to the parallel postulate or to Playfair's axiom have been suggested, some of them appearing at first to be unrelated to parallelism, and some seeming so  self-evident  that they were  unconsciously  assumed by people who claimed to have proven the parallel postulate from Euclid's other postulates.     The sum of the  angles  in every  triangle  is 180.   There exists a triangle whose angles add up to 180.   The sum of the angles is the same for every triangle.   There exists a pair of  similar , but not  congruent , triangles.   Every triangle can be  circumscribed .   If three angles of a  quadrilateral  are  right angles , then the fourth angle is also a right angle.   There exists a quadrilateral of which all angles are right angles.   There exists a pair of straight lines that are at constant  distance  from each other.   Two lines that are parallel to the same line are also parallel to each other.   Given two parallel lines, any line that intersects one of them also intersects the other.   In a  right-angled triangle , the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides ( Pythagoras' Theorem ).   There is no upper limit to the  area  of a triangle.  [1]     However, the alternatives which employ the word ""parallel"" cease appearing so simple when one is obliged to explain which of the three common definitions of ""parallel"" is meant - constant separation, never meeting or same angles where crossed by a third line - since the equivalence of these three is itself one of the unconsciously obvious assumptions equivalent to Euclid's fifth postulate.     [ edit ]   History   For two thousand years, many attempts were made to prove the parallel postulate using Euclid's first four postulates. The main reason that such a proof was so highly sought after was that the fifth postulate isn't self-evident unlike the other postulates. If the order the postulates were listed in the Elements is significant, it indicates that Euclid included this postulate only when he realised he could not prove it or proceed without it. [ 2 ]   Ibn al-Haytham  (Alhazen) (965-1039), an  Iraqi mathematician , made the first attempt at proving the parallel postulate using a  proof by contradiction , [ 3 ]  where he introduced the concept of  motion  and  transformation  into geometry. [ 4 ]  He formulated the  Lambert quadrilateral , which Boris Abramovich Rozenfeld names the ""Ibn al-HaythamLambert quadrilateral"", [ 5 ]  and his attempted proof also shows similarities to  Playfair's axiom . [ 6 ]   Omar Khayym  (1050-1123) made the first attempt at formulating a non-Euclidean  postulate  as an alternative to the parallel postulate, [ 7 ]  and he was the first to consider the cases of  elliptical geometry  and  hyperbolic geometry , though he excluded the latter. [ 8 ]  The  Khayyam-Saccheri quadrilateral  was also first considered by Omar Khayyam in the late 11th century in Book I of  Explanations of the Difficulties in the Postulates of Euclid . [ 5 ]  Unlike many commentators on Euclid before and after him (including  Giovanni Girolamo Saccheri ), Khayyam was not trying to prove the parallel postulate as such but to derive it from an equivalent postulate: ""Two convergent straight lines intersect and it is impossible for two convergent straight lines to diverge in the direction in which they converge."" [ 9 ]  He recognized that three possibilities arose from omitting Euclid's Fifth; if two perpendiculars to one line cross another line, judicious choice of the last can make the internal angles where it meets the two perpendiculars equal (it is then parallel to the first line). If those equal internal angles are right angles, we get Euclid's Fifth; otherwise, they must be either acute or obtuse. He persuaded himself that the acute and obtuse cases lead to contradiction, but had made a tacit assumption equivalent to the fifth to get there.   Nasir al-Din al-Tusi  (1201-1274), in his  Al-risala al-shafiya'an al-shakk fi'l-khutut al-mutawaziya  ( Discussion Which Removes Doubt about Parallel Lines ) (1250), wrote detailed critiques of the parallel postulate and on Khayym's attempted proof a century earlier. Nasir al-Din attempted to derive a proof by contradiction of the parallel postulate. [ 10 ]  He was also one of the first to consider the cases of elliptical geometry and hyperbolic geometry, though he ruled out both of them. [ 8 ]          Euclidean, elliptical and hyperbolic geometry. The Parallel Postulate is satisfied only for models of Euclidean geometry.       Nasir al-Din's son, Sadr al-Din (sometimes known as ""Pseudo-Tusi""), wrote a book on the subject in 1298, based on Nasir al-Din's later thoughts, which presented one of the earliest arguments for a non-Euclidean hypothesis equivalent to the parallel postulate. ""He essentially revised both the Euclidean system of axioms and postulates and the proofs of many propositions from the  Elements ."" [ 10 ] [ 11 ]  His work was published in  Rome  in 1594 and was studied by European geometers. This work marked the starting point for Saccheri's work on the subject. [ 10 ]   Giordano Vitale  (1633-1711), in his book  Euclide restituo  (1680, 1686), used the Khayyam-Saccheri quadrilateral to prove that if three points are equidistant on the base AB and the summit CD, then AB and CD are everywhere equidistant.  Girolamo Saccheri  (1667-1733) pursued the same line of reasoning more thoroughly, correctly obtaining absurdity from the obtuse case (proceeding, like Euclid, from the implicit assumption that lines can be extended indefinitely and have infinite length), but failing to debunk the acute case (although he managed to wrongly persuade himself that he had).   Where Khayym and Saccheri had attempted to prove Euclid's fifth by disproving the only possible alternatives, the nineteenth century finally saw mathematicians exploring those alternatives and discovering the  logically consistent  geometries which result. In 1829,  Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky  published an account of acute geometry in an obscure Russian journal (later re-published in 1840 in German). In 1831,  Jnos Bolyai  included, in a book by his father, an appendix describing acute geometry, which, doubtlessly, he had developed independently of Lobachevsky.  Carl Friedrich Gauss  had actually studied the problem before that, but he did not publish any of his results. However, upon hearing of Boylai's results in a letter from Bolyai's father,  Farkas Bolyai , he stated:     ""If I commenced by saying that I am unable to praise this work, you would certainly be surprised for a moment. But I cannot say otherwise. To praise it would be to praise myself. Indeed the whole contents of the work, the path taken by your son, the results to which he is led, coincide almost entirely with my meditations, which have occupied my mind partly for the last thirty or thirty-five years."" [ 12 ]     The resulting geometries were later developed by  Lobachevsky ,  Riemann  and  Poincar  into  hyperbolic geometry  (the acute case) and  spherical geometry  (the obtuse case). The  independence  of the parallel postulate from Euclid's other axioms was finally demonstrated by  Eugenio Beltrami  in 1868.     [ edit ]   Criticism   Attempts to logically prove this postulate, rather than the eighth axiom, were criticized by  Schopenhauer , as described in  Schopenhauer's criticism of the proofs of the Parallel Postulate .

It comprises a collection of definitions, postulates ( axioms ), propositions ( theorems  and  constructions ), and  mathematical proofs  of the propositions. The thirteen books cover  Euclidean geometry  and the ancient Greek version of elementary  number theory . With the exception of  Autolycus'   On the Moving Sphere , the  Elements  is one of the oldest extant Greek mathematical treatises [ 1 ]  and it is the oldest extant axiomatic deductive treatment of  mathematics . [ 2 ]  It has proven instrumental in the development of  logic  and modern  science .   Euclid's  Elements  is the most successful [ 3 ] [ 4 ]  and influential [ 5 ]  textbook ever written. Being first set in type in  Venice  in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the  printing press  and is estimated to be second only to the  Bible  in the number of editions published, [ 5 ]  with the number reaching well over one thousand. [ 6 ]  It was used as the basic text on geometry throughout the Western world for about 2,000 years. For centuries, when the  quadrivium  was included in the curriculum of all university students, knowledge of at least part of Euclid's  Elements  was required of all students. Not until the 20th century, by which time its content was universally taught through school books, did it cease to be considered something all educated people had read.

[ edit ]   Basis in earlier work          The frontispiece of an  Adelard of Bath  Latin translation of Euclid's  Elements , c. 13091316; the oldest surviving Latin translation of the  Elements  is a 12th century work by Adelard, which translates to Latin from the Arabic. [ 7 ]       Scholars believe that the  Elements  is largely a collection of theorems proved by other mathematicians supplemented by some original work.  Proclus , a Greek mathematician who lived several centuries after Euclid, wrote in his commentary of the  Elements : ""Euclid, who put together the Elements, collecting many of  Eudoxus ' theorems, perfecting many of  Theaetetus ', and also bringing to irrefragable demonstration the things which were only somewhat loosely proved by his predecessors"".  Pythagoras  was probably the source of most of books I and II,  Hippocrates  of book III, and  Eudoxus  book V, while books IV, VI, XI, and XII probably came from other Pythagorean or Athenian mathematicians. [ 8 ]  Euclid often replaced fallacious proofs with his own, more rigorous versions. [ 9 ]  The use of definitions, postulates, and axioms dated back to  Plato . [ 10 ]  The  Elements  may have been based on an earlier textbook by  Hippocrates of Chios  (not the better known  Hippocrates of Kos ), who also may have originated the use of letters to refer to figures. [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Transmission of the text   In the fourth century C.E.  Theon of Alexandria  produced an edition of Euclid which was so widely used that it became the only surviving source until  Franois Peyrard 's 1808 discovery at the  Vatican  of a manuscript not derived from Theon's.   Although known to, for instance,  Cicero , there is no extant record of the text having been translated into Latin prior to  Boethius  in the fifth or sixth century. [ 7 ]  The Arabs received the  Elements  from the Byzantines in approximately 760; this version, by a pupil of Euclid called  Proclo , was translated into  Arabic  under  Harun al Rashid  circa 800 AD. [ 7 ]  The  Elements  was lost to Christian Europe until ca. 1120, when the English monk  Adelard of Bath  disguised himself as a Muslim student in order to obtain a copy in Muslim  Crdoba . [ 12 ]   The first printed edition appeared in 1482 (based on  Giovanni Campano's  1260 edition), and since then it has been translated into many languages and published in about a thousand different editions. Theon's Greek edition was recovered in 1533. In 1570,  John Dee  provided a widely respected ""Mathematical Preface"", along with copious notes and supplementary material, to the first English edition by  Henry Billingsley .   Copies of the Greek text still exist, some of which can be found in the  Vatican Library  and the  Bodleian Library  in Oxford. The manuscripts available are of variable quality, and invariably incomplete. By careful analysis of the translations and originals, hypotheses have been drawn about the contents of the original text (copies of which are no longer available).   Ancient texts which refer to the  Elements  itself and to other mathematical theories that were current at the time it was written are also important in this process. Such analyses are conducted by  J. L. Heiberg  and Sir  Thomas Little Heath  in their editions of the text.   Also of importance are the  scholia , or annotations to the text. These additions, which often distinguished themselves from the main text (depending on the manuscript), gradually accumulated over time as opinions varied upon what was worthy of explanation or elucidation.     [ edit ]   Influence   The  Elements  is still considered a masterpiece in the application of  logic  to  mathematics . In historical context, it has proven enormously influential in many areas of  science . Scientists  Nicolaus Copernicus ,  Johannes Kepler ,  Galileo Galilei , and Sir  Isaac Newton  were all influenced by the  Elements , and applied their knowledge of it to their work. Mathematicians and philosophers, such as  Bertrand Russell ,  Alfred North Whitehead , and  Baruch Spinoza , have attempted to create their own foundational ""Elements"" for their respective disciplines, by adopting the axiomatized deductive structures that Euclid's work introduced.   The austere beauty of Euclidean geometry has been seen by many in western culture as a glimpse of an otherworldly system of perfection and certainty. Abraham Lincoln kept a copy of Euclid in his saddlebag, and studied it late at night by lamplight; he related that he said to himself,  you never can make a lawyer if you do not understand what demonstrate means; and I left my situation in Springfield, went home to my father's house, and stayed there till I could give any proposition in the six books of Euclid at sight . [ 13 ]   Edna St. Vincent Millay  wrote in her sonnet ""Euclid Alone Has Looked on Beauty Bare:""  O blinding hour, O holy, terrible day, When first the shaft into his vision shone Of light anatomized!   Einstein  recalled a copy of the  Elements  and a magnetic compass as two gifts that had a great influence on him as a boy, referring to the Euclid as the ""holy little geometry book"". [ 14 ]   The success of the  Elements  is due primarily to its logical presentation of most of the mathematical knowledge available to Euclid. Much of the material is not original to him, although many of the proofs are his. However, Euclid's systematic development of his subject, from a small set of axioms to deep results, and the consistency of his approach throughout the  Elements , encouraged its use as a textbook for about 2,000 years. The  Elements  still influences modern geometry books. Further, its logical axiomatic approach and rigorous proofs remain the cornerstone of mathematics.     [ edit ]   Outline of  Elements       Main article:  Euclidean geometry              A proof from Euclid's  Elements  that, given a line segment, an equilateral triangle exists that includes the segment as one of its sides. The proof is by construction: an equilateral triangle  is made by drawing circles  and  centered on the points  and , and taking one intersection of the circles as the third vertex of the triangle.         [ edit ]   Contents of the books          A fragment of Euclid's elements found at  Oxyrhynchus , which is dated to circa 100 AD. The diagram accompanies Proposition 5 of Book II of the  Elements .       Books 1 through 4 deal with plane geometry:     Book 1 contains Euclid's 5 axioms (including the  parallel postulate ) and the basic propositions of geometry: the  pons asinorum  (proposition 5) , the  Pythagorean theorem  (Proposition 47), equality of angles and  areas , parallelism, the sum of the angles in a triangle, and the three cases in which triangles are ""equal"" (have the same area).   Book 2 is commonly called the ""book of geometrical algebra,"" because the most of the propositions are geometric interpretations of algebraic identities, such as  a ( b + c +...) =  ab +  ac  + .. or (2 a + b ) 2  + b 2 = 2( a 2  + ( a + b ) 2 ).   Book 3 deals with circles and their properties:  inscribed  angles,  tangents , the power of a point.   Book 4 constructs the  incircle  and  circumcircle  of a triangle, and constructs  regular polygons  with 4, 5, 6, and 15 sides.     Books 5 through 10 introduce  ratios  and  proportions :     Book 5 is a treatise on proportions of  magnitudes . Proposition 25 has as a special case the  inequality of arithmetic and geometric means .   Book 6 applies proportions to geometry:  Thales' theorem , similar figures.   Book 7 deals strictly with elementary number theory:  divisibility ,  prime numbers ,  Euclid's algorithm  for finding the  greatest common divisor ,  least common multiple . Propositions 30 and 32 together are essentially equivalent to the  fundamental theorem of arithmetic  stating that every positive integer can be written as a product of primes in an essentially unique way, though Euclid would have had trouble stating it in this modern form as he did not use the product of more than 3 numbers.   Book 8 deals with proportions in number theory and  geometric sequences .   Book 9 applies the results of the preceding two books and gives the infinitude of prime numbers (proposition 20), the sum of a  geometric series  (proposition 35), and the construction of even  perfect numbers  (proposition 36).   Book 10 attempts to classify  incommensurable  (in modern language,  irrational ) magnitudes by using the  method of exhaustion , a precursor to  integration .     Books 11 through 13 deal with spatial geometry:     Book 11 generalizes the results of Books 16 to space: perpendicularity, parallelism, volumes of  parallelepipeds .   Book 12 studies volumes of  cones ,  pyramids , and  cylinders  in detail, and shows for example that the volume of a cone is a third of the volume of the corresponding cylinder. It concludes by showing the volume of a  sphere  is proportional to the cube of its radius by approximating it by a union of many pyramids.   Book 13 constructs the five regular  Platonic solids  inscribed in a sphere, calculates the ratio of their edges to the radius of the sphere, and proves that there are no further regular solids.       [ edit ]   Euclid's method and style of presentation   Euclid's axiomatic approach was widely influential.   Euclidean geometry is  constructive .   As was common in ancient mathematical texts, when a proposition needed proof in several different cases, Euclid often proved only one of them (often the most difficult), leaving the others to the reader. Later editors such as  Theon  often interpolated their own proofs of these cases.   Euclid's list of axioms was not exhaustive, but represented the principles that were the most important. His proofs often invoke axiomatic notions which were not originally presented in his list of axioms. [ 15 ]   Euclid's presentation was limited by the mathematical ideas and notations in common currency in his era, and this causes the treatment to seem awkward to the modern reader in some places. For example, there was no notion of an angle greater than two right angles, [ 16 ]  the number 1 was sometimes treated separately from other positive integers, and as multiplication was treated geometrically he did not use the product of more than 3 different numbers. The geometrical treatment of number theory may have been because the alternative would have been the extremely awkward  Alexandrian system of numerals . [ 17 ]   The presentation of each result is given in a stylized form, which originated with Euclid: enunciation, statement, construction, proof, and conclusion. No indication is given of the method of reasoning that led to the result, although the  Data  does provide instruction about how to approach the types of problems encountered in the first four books of the  Elements . [ 18 ]     [ edit ]   Apocrypha   It was not uncommon in ancient time to attribute to celebrated authors works that were not written by them. It is by these means that the  apocryphal  books XIV and XV of the  Elements  were sometimes included in the collection. [ 19 ]  The spurious Book XIV was likely written by  Hypsicles  on the basis of a treatise by  Apollonius . The book continues Euclid's comparison of regular solids inscribed in spheres, with the chief result being that the ratio of the surfaces of the  dodecahedron  and  icosahedron  inscribed in the same sphere is the same as the ratio of their volumes, the ratio being  .   The spurious Book XV was likely written, at least in part, by  Isidore of Miletus . This inferior book covers topics such as counting the number of edges and solid angles in the regular solids, and finding the measure of dihedral angles of faces that meet at an edge.

Please  improve this article  if you can.  (April 2008)       In  economics ,  hedonic regression , also  hedonic demand theory , is a method of estimating  demand  or  value . It decomposes the item being researched into its constituent characteristics, and obtains estimates of the contributory value of each characteristic. This requires that the composite good being valued can be reduced to its constituent parts and that the market values those constituent parts. Hedonic models are most commonly estimated using  regression analysis , although more generalized models, such as  sales adjustment grids , are special cases of hedonic models.   An attribute vector, which may be a dummy or panel variable, is assigned to each characteristic or group of characteristics. Hedonic models can accommodate non-linearity, variable interaction, or other complex valuation situations.   Hedonic models are commonly used in  real estate appraisal ,  real estate economics  and  Consumer Price Index  (CPI) calculations. In CPI calculations hedonic regression is used to control the effect of changes in product quality. Price changes that are due to substitution effects are subject to hedonic quality adjustments.           Contents       1   Hedonic models and real estate valuation   2   Criticisms of hedonic models   3   See also   4   References               [ edit ]   Hedonic models and real estate valuation   In real estate economics, it is used to adjust for the problems associated with researching a good that is as  heterogeneous  as buildings. Because buildings are so different, it is difficult to estimate the demand for buildings generically. Instead, it is assumed that a house can be decomposed into characteristics such as number of bedrooms, size of plot, or distance to the city center. A hedonic regression equation treats these attributes (or bundles of attributes) separately, and estimates prices (in the case of an additive model) or elasticity (in the case of a log model) for each of them. This information can be used to construct a price index that can be used to compare the price of housing in different cities, or to do time series analysis. As with CPI calculations, hedonic pricing can be used to correct for quality changes in constructing a housing price index. It can also be used to assess the value of a property, in the absence of specific market transaction data. It can also be used to analyze the demand for various housing characteristics, and housing demand in general. It has also been used to test assumptions in spatial economics.   The  Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice , or USPAP, provides for mass appraisal standards to govern the use of hedonic regressions and other automated valuation models when used for  real estate appraisal . Appraisal methodology treats the hedonic regression as essentially a statistically robust form of the  sales comparison approach [ 1 ] . Hedonic models are commonly used in tax assessment, litigation, academic studies, and other mass appraisal projects.     [ edit ]   Criticisms of hedonic models   Some commentators, including  Austrian economists , have criticized the US government's use of hedonic regression in computing its CPI, fearing it can be used to mask the ""true"" inflation rate and thus lower the interest it must pay on  Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities  (TIPS) and  Social Security  cost of living adjustments [ 2 ]   However, the same use of hedonic models when analyzing consumer prices in other countries has shown that non-hedonic methods may misstate inflation over time by failing to take quality changes into account [ 3 ] .

In  geometry , the  parallel postulate , also called  Euclid 's fifth postulate  because it is the fifth postulate in  Euclid's  Elements , is a distinctive  axiom  in what is now called  Euclidean geometry . It states that:     If a  line segment  intersects two straight  lines  forming two interior angles on the same side that sum to less than two  right angles , then the two lines, if extended indefinitely, meet on that side on which the angles sum to less than two right angles.     Euclidean geometry  is the study of geometry that satisfies all of Euclid's axioms,  including  the parallel postulate. A geometry where the parallel postulate cannot hold is known as a  non-euclidean geometry . Geometry that is  independent  of Euclid's fifth postulate (i.e., only assumes the first four postulates) is known as  absolute geometry  (or, in other places known as neutral geometry).

Euclid did not postulate the  converse  of his fifth postulate, which is one way to distinguish Euclidean geometry from  elliptic geometry . The Elements contains the proof of an equivalent statement (Book I, Proposition 17):  Any two  angles  of a  triangle  are together less than two  right angles .  The proof depends on an earlier proposition:  In a triangle ABC, the  exterior angle  at C is greater than either of the  interior angles  A or B . This in turn depends on Euclid's unstated assumption that two straight lines meet in only one point, a statement not true of elliptic geometry.   In other words, the converse of the fifth postulate follows from Euclid's axioms minus the fifth postulate, plus an axiom stating that two distinct non-parallel straight lines meet in only one point.     [ edit ]   Logically equivalent properties   It is often stated that Euclid's parallel postulate is equivalent to Playfair's axiom, named after the Scottish  mathematician   John Playfair , which states:     Exactly one line can be drawn through any point not on a given line  parallel  to the given line in a plane. [ 1 ]     However this can be seen to be false because Euclid's parallel postulate is not inconsistent with elliptical geometry; two lines in an elliptical space intersected by a third line, forming two interior angles on one side with a sum less than two right angles, will meet on that side. That they meet on the other side as well does not contradict the parallel postulate. Playfair's axiom excludes this possibility by assuming that at least one parallel line through a given point does exist, which Euclid wrongly believed could be proven from his other postulates (Elements, Book 1 Proposition 31).   Many other equivalent statements to the parallel postulate or to Playfair's axiom have been suggested, some of them appearing at first to be unrelated to parallelism, and some seeming so  self-evident  that they were  unconsciously  assumed by people who claimed to have proven the parallel postulate from Euclid's other postulates.     The sum of the  angles  in every  triangle  is 180.   There exists a triangle whose angles add up to 180.   The sum of the angles is the same for every triangle.   There exists a pair of  similar , but not  congruent , triangles.   Every triangle can be  circumscribed .   If three angles of a  quadrilateral  are  right angles , then the fourth angle is also a right angle.   There exists a quadrilateral of which all angles are right angles.   There exists a pair of straight lines that are at constant  distance  from each other.   Two lines that are parallel to the same line are also parallel to each other.   Given two parallel lines, any line that intersects one of them also intersects the other.   In a  right-angled triangle , the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides ( Pythagoras' Theorem ).   There is no upper limit to the  area  of a triangle.  [1]     However, the alternatives which employ the word ""parallel"" cease appearing so simple when one is obliged to explain which of the three common definitions of ""parallel"" is meant - constant separation, never meeting or same angles where crossed by a third line - since the equivalence of these three is itself one of the unconsciously obvious assumptions equivalent to Euclid's fifth postulate.     [ edit ]   History   For two thousand years, many attempts were made to prove the parallel postulate using Euclid's first four postulates. The main reason that such a proof was so highly sought after was that the fifth postulate isn't self-evident unlike the other postulates. If the order the postulates were listed in the Elements is significant, it indicates that Euclid included this postulate only when he realised he could not prove it or proceed without it. [ 2 ]   Ibn al-Haytham  (Alhazen) (965-1039), an  Iraqi mathematician , made the first attempt at proving the parallel postulate using a  proof by contradiction , [ 3 ]  where he introduced the concept of  motion  and  transformation  into geometry. [ 4 ]  He formulated the  Lambert quadrilateral , which Boris Abramovich Rozenfeld names the ""Ibn al-HaythamLambert quadrilateral"", [ 5 ]  and his attempted proof also shows similarities to  Playfair's axiom . [ 6 ]   Omar Khayym  (1050-1123) made the first attempt at formulating a non-Euclidean  postulate  as an alternative to the parallel postulate, [ 7 ]  and he was the first to consider the cases of  elliptical geometry  and  hyperbolic geometry , though he excluded the latter. [ 8 ]  The  Khayyam-Saccheri quadrilateral  was also first considered by Omar Khayyam in the late 11th century in Book I of  Explanations of the Difficulties in the Postulates of Euclid . [ 5 ]  Unlike many commentators on Euclid before and after him (including  Giovanni Girolamo Saccheri ), Khayyam was not trying to prove the parallel postulate as such but to derive it from an equivalent postulate: ""Two convergent straight lines intersect and it is impossible for two convergent straight lines to diverge in the direction in which they converge."" [ 9 ]  He recognized that three possibilities arose from omitting Euclid's Fifth; if two perpendiculars to one line cross another line, judicious choice of the last can make the internal angles where it meets the two perpendiculars equal (it is then parallel to the first line). If those equal internal angles are right angles, we get Euclid's Fifth; otherwise, they must be either acute or obtuse. He persuaded himself that the acute and obtuse cases lead to contradiction, but had made a tacit assumption equivalent to the fifth to get there.   Nasir al-Din al-Tusi  (1201-1274), in his  Al-risala al-shafiya'an al-shakk fi'l-khutut al-mutawaziya  ( Discussion Which Removes Doubt about Parallel Lines ) (1250), wrote detailed critiques of the parallel postulate and on Khayym's attempted proof a century earlier. Nasir al-Din attempted to derive a proof by contradiction of the parallel postulate. [ 10 ]  He was also one of the first to consider the cases of elliptical geometry and hyperbolic geometry, though he ruled out both of them. [ 8 ]          Euclidean, elliptical and hyperbolic geometry. The Parallel Postulate is satisfied only for models of Euclidean geometry.       Nasir al-Din's son, Sadr al-Din (sometimes known as ""Pseudo-Tusi""), wrote a book on the subject in 1298, based on Nasir al-Din's later thoughts, which presented one of the earliest arguments for a non-Euclidean hypothesis equivalent to the parallel postulate. ""He essentially revised both the Euclidean system of axioms and postulates and the proofs of many propositions from the  Elements ."" [ 10 ] [ 11 ]  His work was published in  Rome  in 1594 and was studied by European geometers. This work marked the starting point for Saccheri's work on the subject. [ 10 ]   Giordano Vitale  (1633-1711), in his book  Euclide restituo  (1680, 1686), used the Khayyam-Saccheri quadrilateral to prove that if three points are equidistant on the base AB and the summit CD, then AB and CD are everywhere equidistant.  Girolamo Saccheri  (1667-1733) pursued the same line of reasoning more thoroughly, correctly obtaining absurdity from the obtuse case (proceeding, like Euclid, from the implicit assumption that lines can be extended indefinitely and have infinite length), but failing to debunk the acute case (although he managed to wrongly persuade himself that he had).   Where Khayym and Saccheri had attempted to prove Euclid's fifth by disproving the only possible alternatives, the nineteenth century finally saw mathematicians exploring those alternatives and discovering the  logically consistent  geometries which result. In 1829,  Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky  published an account of acute geometry in an obscure Russian journal (later re-published in 1840 in German). In 1831,  Jnos Bolyai  included, in a book by his father, an appendix describing acute geometry, which, doubtlessly, he had developed independently of Lobachevsky.  Carl Friedrich Gauss  had actually studied the problem before that, but he did not publish any of his results. However, upon hearing of Boylai's results in a letter from Bolyai's father,  Farkas Bolyai , he stated:     ""If I commenced by saying that I am unable to praise this work, you would certainly be surprised for a moment. But I cannot say otherwise. To praise it would be to praise myself. Indeed the whole contents of the work, the path taken by your son, the results to which he is led, coincide almost entirely with my meditations, which have occupied my mind partly for the last thirty or thirty-five years."" [ 12 ]     The resulting geometries were later developed by  Lobachevsky ,  Riemann  and  Poincar  into  hyperbolic geometry  (the acute case) and  spherical geometry  (the obtuse case). The  independence  of the parallel postulate from Euclid's other axioms was finally demonstrated by  Eugenio Beltrami  in 1868.     [ edit ]   Criticism   Attempts to logically prove this postulate, rather than the eighth axiom, were criticized by  Schopenhauer , as described in  Schopenhauer's criticism of the proofs of the Parallel Postulate .

clueweb09-enwp00-75-11097	"                     Euclid's lemma          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search          Euclid's lemma  ( Greek    ) is a generalization of Proposition 30 of Book VII of  Euclid's Elements . The  lemma  states that     If a  positive integer   divides  the product of two other positive integers, and the first and second integers are  coprime , then the first integer divides the third integer.     This can be written in notation:     If  n | ab  and  gcd ( n , a ) = 1 then  n | b .     Proposition 30, also known as  Euclid 's first  theorem , states:     If a  prime number  divides the product of two positive integers, then the prime number divides at least one of the positive integers.     That can be written as:     If  p | ab  then  p | a  or  p | b .     Often, proposition 30 is called Euclid's lemma instead of the generalization. A  lemma  is a ""mini"" theorem that is proven and used to prove a bigger theorem. Most of the time in mathematics textbooks Euclid's lemma is used to prove the  fundamental theorem of arithmetic .     [ edit ]   Proof of Proposition 30   Say  p  is a prime factor of  ab , but also state that it is not a factor of  a . Therefore,  , where  r  is the other corresponding factor to produce  ab . As  p  is prime, and also because it is not a factor of  a ,  a  and  p  must be  coprime . This means that two integers  x  and  y  can be found so that   ( Bzout's identity ). Multiply with  b  on both sides:           .     We stated previously that  , and so:           .     Therefore,  p  is a factor of  b . This means that  p  must always exactly divide either  a  or  b  or both.  Q.E.D.     [ edit ]   Example   Euclid's lemma in plain language says: If a number  N  is a multiple of a prime number  p , and  N  =  a    b , then at least one of  a  and  b  must be a multiple of  p . Say,     ,   ,     and     .     Then either         or     .     Obviously, in this case, 7 divides 14 ( x  = 2).

clueweb09-en0003-72-20742	"  Euclid's definitions         Geometry index   History Topics Index     Version for printing       Book 1 of  The Elements   begins with numerous definitions followed by the famous five postulates. Then, before  Euclid  starts to prove theorems, he gives a list of common notions. The first few definitions are:   Def. 1.1.  A point is that which has no part.  Def. 1.2.  A line is a breadthless length.  Def. 1.3.  The extremities of lines are points.  Def. 1.4.  A straight line lies equally with respect to the points on itself.    The postulates are ones of construction such as:    One can draw a straight line from any point to any point.    The common notions are axioms such as:    Things equal to the same thing are also equal to one another.    We should note certain things.   Euclid  seems to define a point twice (definitions 1 and 3) and a line twice (definitions 2 and 4). This is rather strange.    Euclid  never makes use of the definitions and never refers to them in the rest of the text.    Some concepts are never defined. For example there is no notion of ordering the points on a line, so the idea that one point is between two others is never defined, but of course it is used.    As we noted in  The real numbers: Pythagoras to Stevin , Book V of  The Elements   considers magnitudes and the theory of proportion of magnitudes. However  Euclid  leaves the concept of magnitude undefined and this appears to modern readers as though  Euclid  has failed to set up magnitudes with the rigour for which he is famed.    When  Euclid  introduces magnitudes and numbers he gives some definitions but no postulates or common notions. For example one might expect  Euclid  to postulate  a  +  b  =  b  +  a , ( a  +  b ) +  c  =  a  + ( b  +  c ), etc., but he does not.    When  Euclid  introduces numbers in Book VII he does make a definition rather similar to the basic ones at the beginning of Book I:    A unit is that by virtue of which each of the things that exist are called one.     Some historians have suggested that the difference between the way that basic definitions occur at the beginning of Book I and of Book V is not because  Euclid  was less rigorous in Book V, rather they suggest that  Euclid  always left his basic concepts undefined and the definitions at the beginning of Book I are later additions. What is the evidence for this?    The first comment would be that this would explain why  Euclid  never refers to the basic definitions. If they were not in the text that  Euclid  wrote then of course he couldn't refer to them. The next point to note is that they are very similar to the work which is ascribed to  Heron  called  Definitions of terms in geometry.  This contains 133 definitions of geometrical terms beginning with points, lines etc. which are very close to those given by  Euclid . In [ 2 ] Knorr argues convincingly that this work is in fact due to  Diophantus . The point here is the following. Is   Definitions of terms in geometry   based on  Euclid 's  Elements   or have the basic definitions from this work been inserted into later versions of  The Elements?     We have to consider what Sextus Empiricus says about definitions. First note that Sextus wrote about 200 AD and it was believed until comparatively recently that  Heron  lived later than this. Were this the case, then of course Sextus could not have referred to anything written by  Heron . However more recently  Heron  has been dated to the first century AD and this tells us that Sextus wrote after  Heron . The other part of the puzzle we have to consider here is the earliest version of  Euclid 's  Elements  to be found. When Vesuvius erupted in 79 AD, Herculaneum together with Pompeii and Stabiae, was destroyed. Herculaneum was buried by a compact mass of material about 16 m deep which preserved the city until excavations began in the 18th century. Special conditions of humidity of the ground conserved wood, cloth, food, and in particular papyri which give us important information. One papyrus found there contains fragments of  The Elements  and was clearly written before 79 AD. Since Philodemus, a student of  Zeno of Sidon , took his library of papyri there some time soon after 75 BC the version of  The Elements  is likely to be of around that date.    Let us go back to Sextus who writes about ""mathematicians describing geometrical entities"" and it is interesting that the word ""describing"" is not used in  The Elements  but is used by  Heron  in  Definitions of terms in geometry.  Again the descriptions he gives are closer to the exact words appearing in  Heron  than those of  Euclid . When Sextus give ""the definition of a circle"" he uses the word ""definition"" which is that of  Euclid . Sextus quotes the precise definition of a circle which appears in the Herculaneum fragment. This does not include a definition of ""circumference"" although  Euclid  does use the notion of circumference of a circle. The later versions of  The Elements  which have come down to us include a definition of ""circumference"" within the definition of a circle.    None of the above proves whether the basic definitions of geometric objects have been added to  The Elements  later. They do show fairly convincingly that the definition of a circle has been extended to include the definition of circumference in later editions of the book. The hypothesis is that Sextus has  The Elements  and  Definitions of terms in geometry  in front of him when he is writing and he uses the word ""describe"" when he refers to  Heron  and ""define"" when he refers to  Euclid . Even it this is correct it still doesn't prove that the version of  The Elements  sitting in front of Sextus does not contain basic definitions of geometric objects but it does make such a possibility at least worth debating. What do you think?   One last point to think about. We quoted above:   Def. 1.4.  A straight line lies equally with respect to the points on itself.     What does this mean? It does seem a strange description for  Euclid  to give, for it appears to be meaningless. Compare it with the definition of a straight line in  Definitions of terms in geometry :    A straight line is a line that equally with respect to all points on itself lies straight and maximally taut between its extremities.     Again we ask the reader: do you think that the definition appearing in  The Elements  is a corruption of  Heron 's definition and so was added later, or do you think that  Euclid  gave a rather poor definition which was improved by  Heron ? Why do neither use the definition of a straight line as the shortest distance between two points?

A program is prepared by first formulating the task and then expressing it in an appropriate  programming language . Programmers may work in  machine language  or in  assembly languages . But most applications programmers use one of the high-level languages (such as  BASIC  or  C++ ) or  fourth-generation languages  that more closely resemble human communication. Other programs then translate the instructions into machine language for the computer to use. Programs are stored on permanent media (such as a  hard disk ), and loaded into  RAM  to be executed by the computer's processor, which executes each instruction in the program, one at a time. Programs are often divided into applications and system programs. Applications perform tasks such as  word processing ,  database  functions, or accessing the  Internet . System programs control the functioning of the computer itself; an  operating system  is a very large program that controls the operations of the computer, the transfer of files, and the processing of other programs.

These programming instructions cause the computer to perform arithmetic and logical operations or comparisons (and then take some additional action based on the comparison) or to input or output data in a desired sequence. In conventional computing the operations are executed sequentially; in  parallel processing  the operations are allocated among multiple processors, which execute them concurrently and share the results. Programs are often written as a series of subroutines, which can be used in more than one program or at more than one point in the same program. Systems programs are those that control the operation of the computer. Chief among these is the operating systemalso called the control program, executive, or supervisorwhich schedules the execution of other programs, allocates system resources, and controls input and output operations. Processing programs are those whose execution is controlled by the operating system. Language translators decode source programs, written in a  programming language , and produce object programs, which are in machine language and can be understood by the computer. These include assemblers, which translate symbolic languages that have a one-to-one relationship with machine language; compilers, which translate an algorithmic- or procedural-language program into a machine-language program to be executed at a later time; and interpreters, which translate source-language statements into object-language statements for immediate execution. Other processing programs are service or utility programs, such as those that dump computer memory to external storage for safekeeping and those that enable the programmer to trace program execution, and application programs, which perform business and scientific functions, such as payroll processing, accounts payable and receivable posting, word processing, and simulation of environmental conditions.

[ 1 ]  A computer requires programs to function. Moreover, a computer program does not run unless its instructions are executed by a  central processor ; [ 2 ]  however, a program may communicate an  algorithm  to people without running. Computer programs are usually  executable  programs or the  source code  from which executable programs are derived (e.g.,  compiled ).   Computer source code is often written by professional  computer programmers . Source code is written in a  programming language  that usually follows one of two main  paradigms :  imperative  or  declarative  programming. Source code may be converted into an  executable file  (sometimes called an executable program or a binary) by a  compiler . Alternatively, computer programs may be executed by a  central processing unit  with the aid of an  interpreter , or may be  embedded  directly into  hardware .   Computer programs may be categorized along functional lines:  system software  and  application software . And many computer programs may run simultaneously on a single computer, a process known as  multitasking .

Editing source code involves testing, analyzing, and refining, and sometimes coordinating with other programmers on a jointly developed program. A person who practices this skill is referred to as a computer  programmer  or software developer. The sometimes lengthy process of computer programming is usually referred to as  software development . The term  software engineering  is becoming popular as the process is seen as an  engineering  discipline.       Paradigms   Computer programs can be categorized by the  programming language   paradigm  used to produce them. Two of the main paradigms are  imperative  and  declarative .   Programs written using an imperative language specify an  algorithm  using declarations, expressions, and statements. [ 3 ]  A declaration associates a  variable  name with a  datatype . For example:  var x: integer;  . An expression yields a value. For example:  2 + 2  yields 4. Finally, a statement might assign an expression to a variable or use the value of a variable to alter the program's control flow. For example:  x := 2 + 2; if x = 4 then do_something();  One criticism of imperative languages is the side-effect of an assignment statement on a class of variables called non-local variables. [ 4 ]   Programs written using a declarative language specify the properties that have to be met by the output and do not specify any implementation details. Two broad categories of declarative languages are  functional languages  and  logical languages . The principle behind functional languages (like  Haskell ) is to not allow side-effects, which makes it easier to reason about programs like mathematical functions. [ 4 ]  The principle behind logical languages (like  Prolog ) is to define the problem to be solved  the goal  and leave the detailed solution to the Prolog system itself. [ 5 ]  The goal is defined by providing a list of subgoals. Then each subgoal is defined by further providing a list of its subgoals, etc. If a path of subgoals fails to find a solution, then that subgoal is  backtracked  and another path is systematically attempted.   The form in which a program is created may be textual or visual. In a  visual language  program, elements are graphically manipulated rather than textually specified.       Compilation or interpretation   A  computer program  in the form of a  human-readable , computer programming language is called  source code . Source code may be converted into an  executable image  by a  compiler  or executed immediately with the aid of an  interpreter .   Compiled computer programs are commonly referred to as executables, binary images, or simply as  binaries   a reference to the  binary   file format  used to store the executable code. Compilers are used to translate source code from a programming language into either  object code  or  machine code . Object code needs further processing to become machine code, and machine code is the  Central Processing Unit 's native  code , ready for execution.   Interpreted computer programs are either decoded and then immediately executed or are decoded into some efficient intermediate representation for future execution.  BASIC ,  Perl , and  Python  are examples of immediately executed computer programs. Alternatively,  Java  computer programs are compiled ahead of time and stored as a machine independent code called  bytecode . Bytecode is then executed upon request by an interpreter called a  virtual machine .   The main disadvantage of interpreters is computer programs run slower than if compiled. Interpreting code is slower than running the compiled version because the interpreter must  decode  each  statement  each time it is loaded and then perform the desired action. On the other hand, software development may be quicker using an interpreter because testing is immediate when the compilation step is omitted. Another disadvantage of interpreters is the interpreter must be present on the computer at the time the computer program is executed. By contrast, compiled computer programs need not have the compiler present at the time of execution.   No properties of a programming language require it to be exclusively compiled or exclusively interpreted. The categorization usually reflects the most popular method of language execution. For example, BASIC is thought of as an interpreted language and C a compiled language, despite the existence of BASIC compilers and C interpreters. Some systems use  Just-in-time compilation  (JIT) whereby sections of the source are compiled 'on the fly' and stored for subsequent executions.       Self-modifying programs   A computer program in  execution  is normally treated as being different from the  data  the program operates on. However, in some cases this distinction is blurred when a computer program modifies itself. The modified computer program is subsequently executed as part of the same program.  Self-modifying code  is possible for programs written in  Machine code ,  Assembler ,  Lisp ,  COBOL ,  PL/1  and  Prolog  and probably many others. Sometimes self modification is used as a form of dynamic optimization where the code becomes more efficient through  caching  or similar techniques. The technique is also often used to nullify all overhead of already embedded debugging code after a 'one time' test decides that debugging should be 'switched off' for the run. Early mainframe operating systems allowed program overlays as a normal practice for application programs, to conserve memory.       Execution and storage   Typically, computer programs are stored in  non-volatile memory  until requested either directly or indirectly to be  executed  by the computer user. Upon such a request, the program is loaded into  random access memory , by a computer program called an  operating system , where it can be accessed directly by the central processor. The central processor then executes (""runs"") the program, instruction by instruction, until termination. A program in execution is called a  process . [ 6 ]  Termination is either by normal self-termination or by error  software or hardware error.       Embedded programs          The  microcontroller  on the right of this  USB flash drive  is controlled with embedded  firmware .       Some computer programs are embedded into hardware. A  stored-program computer  requires an initial computer program stored in its  read-only memory  to  boot . The boot process is to identify and initialize all aspects of the system, from  CPU registers  to  device controllers  to  memory  contents. [ 7 ]  Following the initialization process, this initial computer program loads the  operating system  and sets the  program counter  to begin normal operations. Independent of the host computer, a  hardware device  might have embedded  firmware  to control its operation. Firmware is used when the computer program is rarely or never expected to change, or when the program must not be lost when the power is off. [ 8 ]       Manual programming          Switches for manual input on a  Data General Nova  3       Computer programs historically were manually input to the central processor via switches. An instruction was represented by a configuration of on/off settings. After setting the configuration, an execute button was pressed. This process was then repeated. Computer programs also historically were manually input via  paper tape  or  punched cards . After the medium was loaded, the starting address was set via switches and the execute button pressed. [ 9 ]       Automatic program generation   Generative programming  is a style of  computer programming  that creates  source code  through  generic   classes ,  prototypes ,  templates ,  aspects , and  code generators  to improve  programmer  productivity. Source code is generated with  programming tools  such as a  template processor  or an  Integrated Development Environment . The simplest form of source code generator is a  macro  processor, such as the  C preprocessor , which replaces patterns in source code according to relatively simple rules.   Software engines  output source code or  markup code  that simultaneously become the input to another  computer process . The analogy is that of one process driving another process, with the computer code being burned as fuel.  Application servers  are software engines that deliver applications to  client computers . For example, a  Wiki  is an application server that allows users to build  dynamic content  assembled from  articles . Wikis generate  HTML ,  CSS ,  Java , and  Javascript  which are then  interpreted  by a  web browser .       Simultaneous execution     See also:  Process (computing)  and  Multiprocessing     Many operating systems support  multitasking  which enables many computer programs to appear to be running simultaneously on a single computer. Operating systems may run multiple programs through  process scheduling   a software mechanism to  switch  the CPU among processes frequently so that users can  interact  with each program while it is running. [ 10 ]  Within hardware, modern day multiprocessor computers or computers with multicore processors may run multiple programs. [ 11 ]       Functional categories   Computer programs may be categorized along functional lines. These functional categories are  system software  and  application software . System software includes the  operating system  which couples the  computer's hardware  with the application software. [ 12 ]  The purpose of the operating system is to provide an environment in which application software executes in a convenient and efficient manner. [ 12 ]  In addition to the operating system, system software includes  utility programs  that help manage and tune the computer. If a computer program is not system software then it is application software. Application software includes  middleware , which couples the system software with the  user interface . Application software also includes utility programs that help users solve application problems, like the need for sorting.

In  geometry , the  parallel postulate , also called  Euclid 's fifth postulate  because it is the fifth postulate in  Euclid's  Elements , is a distinctive  axiom  in what is now called  Euclidean geometry . It states that:     If a  line segment  intersects two straight  lines  forming two interior angles on the same side that sum to less than two  right angles , then the two lines, if extended indefinitely, meet on that side on which the angles sum to less than two right angles.     Euclidean geometry  is the study of geometry that satisfies all of Euclid's axioms,  including  the parallel postulate. A geometry where the parallel postulate cannot hold is known as a  non-euclidean geometry . Geometry that is  independent  of Euclid's fifth postulate (i.e., only assumes the first four postulates) is known as  absolute geometry  (or, in other places known as neutral geometry).           Contents       1   Converse of Euclid's parallel postulate   2   Logically equivalent properties   3   History   4   Criticism   5   See also   6   References   7   Further reading               [ edit ]   Converse of Euclid's parallel postulate          If the sum of the two interior angles equals 180, the lines are parallel and will never intersect.       Euclid did not postulate the  converse  of his fifth postulate, which is one way to distinguish Euclidean geometry from  elliptic geometry . The Elements contains the proof of an equivalent statement (Book I, Proposition 17):  Any two  angles  of a  triangle  are together less than two  right angles .  The proof depends on an earlier proposition:  In a triangle ABC, the  exterior angle  at C is greater than either of the  interior angles  A or B . This in turn depends on Euclid's unstated assumption that two straight lines meet in only one point, a statement not true of elliptic geometry.   In other words, the converse of the fifth postulate follows from Euclid's axioms minus the fifth postulate, plus an axiom stating that two distinct non-parallel straight lines meet in only one point.     [ edit ]   Logically equivalent properties   It is often stated that Euclid's parallel postulate is equivalent to Playfair's axiom, named after the Scottish  mathematician   John Playfair , which states:     Exactly one line can be drawn through any point not on a given line  parallel  to the given line in a plane. [ 1 ]     However this can be seen to be false because Euclid's parallel postulate is not inconsistent with elliptical geometry; two lines in an elliptical space intersected by a third line, forming two interior angles on one side with a sum less than two right angles, will meet on that side. That they meet on the other side as well does not contradict the parallel postulate. Playfair's axiom excludes this possibility by assuming that at least one parallel line through a given point does exist, which Euclid wrongly believed could be proven from his other postulates (Elements, Book 1 Proposition 31).   Many other equivalent statements to the parallel postulate or to Playfair's axiom have been suggested, some of them appearing at first to be unrelated to parallelism, and some seeming so  self-evident  that they were  unconsciously  assumed by people who claimed to have proven the parallel postulate from Euclid's other postulates.     The sum of the  angles  in every  triangle  is 180.   There exists a triangle whose angles add up to 180.   The sum of the angles is the same for every triangle.   There exists a pair of  similar , but not  congruent , triangles.   Every triangle can be  circumscribed .   If three angles of a  quadrilateral  are  right angles , then the fourth angle is also a right angle.   There exists a quadrilateral of which all angles are right angles.   There exists a pair of straight lines that are at constant  distance  from each other.   Two lines that are parallel to the same line are also parallel to each other.   Given two parallel lines, any line that intersects one of them also intersects the other.   In a  right-angled triangle , the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides ( Pythagoras' Theorem ).   There is no upper limit to the  area  of a triangle.  [1]     However, the alternatives which employ the word ""parallel"" cease appearing so simple when one is obliged to explain which of the three common definitions of ""parallel"" is meant - constant separation, never meeting or same angles where crossed by a third line - since the equivalence of these three is itself one of the unconsciously obvious assumptions equivalent to Euclid's fifth postulate.     [ edit ]   History   For two thousand years, many attempts were made to prove the parallel postulate using Euclid's first four postulates. The main reason that such a proof was so highly sought after was that the fifth postulate isn't self-evident unlike the other postulates. If the order the postulates were listed in the Elements is significant, it indicates that Euclid included this postulate only when he realised he could not prove it or proceed without it. [ 2 ]   Ibn al-Haytham  (Alhazen) (965-1039), an  Iraqi mathematician , made the first attempt at proving the parallel postulate using a  proof by contradiction , [ 3 ]  where he introduced the concept of  motion  and  transformation  into geometry. [ 4 ]  He formulated the  Lambert quadrilateral , which Boris Abramovich Rozenfeld names the ""Ibn al-HaythamLambert quadrilateral"", [ 5 ]  and his attempted proof also shows similarities to  Playfair's axiom . [ 6 ]   Omar Khayym  (1050-1123) made the first attempt at formulating a non-Euclidean  postulate  as an alternative to the parallel postulate, [ 7 ]  and he was the first to consider the cases of  elliptical geometry  and  hyperbolic geometry , though he excluded the latter. [ 8 ]  The  Khayyam-Saccheri quadrilateral  was also first considered by Omar Khayyam in the late 11th century in Book I of  Explanations of the Difficulties in the Postulates of Euclid . [ 5 ]  Unlike many commentators on Euclid before and after him (including  Giovanni Girolamo Saccheri ), Khayyam was not trying to prove the parallel postulate as such but to derive it from an equivalent postulate: ""Two convergent straight lines intersect and it is impossible for two convergent straight lines to diverge in the direction in which they converge."" [ 9 ]  He recognized that three possibilities arose from omitting Euclid's Fifth; if two perpendiculars to one line cross another line, judicious choice of the last can make the internal angles where it meets the two perpendiculars equal (it is then parallel to the first line). If those equal internal angles are right angles, we get Euclid's Fifth; otherwise, they must be either acute or obtuse. He persuaded himself that the acute and obtuse cases lead to contradiction, but had made a tacit assumption equivalent to the fifth to get there.   Nasir al-Din al-Tusi  (1201-1274), in his  Al-risala al-shafiya'an al-shakk fi'l-khutut al-mutawaziya  ( Discussion Which Removes Doubt about Parallel Lines ) (1250), wrote detailed critiques of the parallel postulate and on Khayym's attempted proof a century earlier. Nasir al-Din attempted to derive a proof by contradiction of the parallel postulate. [ 10 ]  He was also one of the first to consider the cases of elliptical geometry and hyperbolic geometry, though he ruled out both of them. [ 8 ]          Euclidean, elliptical and hyperbolic geometry. The Parallel Postulate is satisfied only for models of Euclidean geometry.       Nasir al-Din's son, Sadr al-Din (sometimes known as ""Pseudo-Tusi""), wrote a book on the subject in 1298, based on Nasir al-Din's later thoughts, which presented one of the earliest arguments for a non-Euclidean hypothesis equivalent to the parallel postulate. ""He essentially revised both the Euclidean system of axioms and postulates and the proofs of many propositions from the  Elements ."" [ 10 ] [ 11 ]  His work was published in  Rome  in 1594 and was studied by European geometers. This work marked the starting point for Saccheri's work on the subject. [ 10 ]   Giordano Vitale  (1633-1711), in his book  Euclide restituo  (1680, 1686), used the Khayyam-Saccheri quadrilateral to prove that if three points are equidistant on the base AB and the summit CD, then AB and CD are everywhere equidistant.  Girolamo Saccheri  (1667-1733) pursued the same line of reasoning more thoroughly, correctly obtaining absurdity from the obtuse case (proceeding, like Euclid, from the implicit assumption that lines can be extended indefinitely and have infinite length), but failing to debunk the acute case (although he managed to wrongly persuade himself that he had).   Where Khayym and Saccheri had attempted to prove Euclid's fifth by disproving the only possible alternatives, the nineteenth century finally saw mathematicians exploring those alternatives and discovering the  logically consistent  geometries which result. In 1829,  Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky  published an account of acute geometry in an obscure Russian journal (later re-published in 1840 in German). In 1831,  Jnos Bolyai  included, in a book by his father, an appendix describing acute geometry, which, doubtlessly, he had developed independently of Lobachevsky.  Carl Friedrich Gauss  had actually studied the problem before that, but he did not publish any of his results. However, upon hearing of Boylai's results in a letter from Bolyai's father,  Farkas Bolyai , he stated:     ""If I commenced by saying that I am unable to praise this work, you would certainly be surprised for a moment. But I cannot say otherwise. To praise it would be to praise myself. Indeed the whole contents of the work, the path taken by your son, the results to which he is led, coincide almost entirely with my meditations, which have occupied my mind partly for the last thirty or thirty-five years."" [ 12 ]     The resulting geometries were later developed by  Lobachevsky ,  Riemann  and  Poincar  into  hyperbolic geometry  (the acute case) and  spherical geometry  (the obtuse case). The  independence  of the parallel postulate from Euclid's other axioms was finally demonstrated by  Eugenio Beltrami  in 1868.     [ edit ]   Criticism   Attempts to logically prove this postulate, rather than the eighth axiom, were criticized by  Schopenhauer , as described in  Schopenhauer's criticism of the proofs of the Parallel Postulate .

Euclidean geometry  is a mathematical system attributed to the  Greek mathematician   Euclid  of  Alexandria .  Euclid's  Elements  is the earliest known systematic discussion of  geometry . It has been one of the most influential books in history, as much for its method as for its mathematical content. The method consists of assuming a small set of intuitively appealing  axioms , and then proving many other  propositions  ( theorems ) from those axioms. Although many of Euclid's results had been stated by earlier Greek mathematicians, Euclid was the first to show how these propositions could be fit together into a comprehensive deductive and  logical system .The  Elements  begin with  plane geometry , still taught in  secondary school  as the first  axiomatic system  and the first examples of  formal proof . It goes on to the  solid geometry  of three  dimensions . Much of the  Elements  states results of what is now called  number theory , proved using geometrical methods.   For over two thousand years, the adjective ""Euclidean"" was unnecessary because no other sort of geometry had been conceived. Euclid's axioms seemed so intuitively obvious that any theorem proved from them was deemed true in an absolute sense. Today, however, many other  self-consistent   non-Euclidean geometries  are known, the first ones having been discovered in the early 19th century. It also is no longer taken for granted that Euclidean geometry describes physical space. An implication of  Einstein 's theory of  general relativity  is that Euclidean geometry is a good approximation to the properties of physical space only if the  gravitational field  is not too strong.

Its superiority over earlier treatments was rapidly recognized, with the result that there was little interest in preserving the earlier ones, and they are now nearly all lost.   Books I-IV discuss plane geometry. Many results about plane figures are proved, e.g.,  If a triangle has two equal angles, then the sides subtended by the angles are equal.  The  Pythagorean theorem  is proved. [ 2 ]   Books V-X deal with number theory, with numbers treated geometrically via their representation as line segments with various lengths. Notions such as  prime numbers  and  rational  and  irrational  numbers are introduced. The infinitude of prime numbers is proved.   Books XI-XIII concern solid geometry. A typical result is the 1:3 ratio between the volume of a cone and a cylinder with the same height and base.     [ edit ]   Axiomatic treatment          A proof from Euclid's elements that, given a line segment, an equilateral triangle exists that includes the segment as one of its sides. The proof is by construction: an equilateral triangle  is made by drawing circles  and  centered on the points  and , and taking one intersection of the circles as the third vertex of the triangle.       Euclidean geometry is an  axiomatic system , in which all  theorems  (""true statements"") are derived from a small number of axioms. Near the beginning of the first book of the  Elements , Euclid gives five  postulates  (axioms) for plane geometry: [ 3 ]     Let the following be postulated: to draw a  straight line  from any  point  to any point.   To produce [extend] a  finite straight line  continuously in a straight line.   To describe a  circle  with any center and distance [radius].   That all right angles are equal to one another.   The  parallel postulate : That, if a straight line falling on two straight lines make the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which are the angles less than the two right angles.     The  Elements  also include the following five ""common notions"":     Things that equal the same thing also equal one another.   If equals are added to equals, then the wholes are equal.   If equals are subtracted from equals, then the remainders are equal.   Things that coincide with one another equal one another.   The whole is greater than the part.       [ edit ]   Constructive approach   Euclidean geometry is  constructive . Postulates 1, 2, 3, and 5 assert the existence and uniqueness of certain geometric figures, and these assertions are of a constructive nature: that is, we are not only told that certain things exist, but are also given methods for creating them with no more than a  compass and an unmarked straightedge . [ 4 ]  In this sense, Euclidean geometry is more concrete than many modern axiomatic systems such as  set theory , which often assert the existence of objects without saying how to construct them, or even assert the existence of objects that cannot be constructed within the theory. Strictly speaking, the lines on paper are  models  of the objects defined within the formal system, rather than instances of those objects. For example a Euclidean straight line has no width, but any real drawn line will. Although  nonconstructive methods  are today considered by nearly all mathematicians to be just as sound as constructive ones, Euclid's constructive proofs often supplanted fallacious nonconstructive ones, e.g., some of the Pythagoreans' proofs involving irrational numbers, which usually required a statement such as ""Find the greatest common measure of ..."" [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   The parallel postulate   Main article:  Parallel postulate          The parallel postulate: If two lines intersect a third in such a way that the sum of the inner angles on one side is less than two right angles, then the two lines inevitably must intersect each other on that side if extended far enough.       To the ancients, the parallel postulate seemed less obvious than the others. Euclid himself seems to have considered it as being qualitatively different from the others, as evidenced by the organization of the  Elements : the first 28 propositions he presents are those that can be proved without it.   Many alternative axioms can be formulated that have the same logical consequences as the parallel postulate. For example  Playfair's axiom  states:     Through a point not on a given straight line, at most one line can be drawn that never meets the given line.       [ edit ]   System of measurement and arithmetic   Euclidean geometry has two fundamental types of measurements: angle and distance. The angle scale is absolute, and Euclid uses the right angle as his basic unit, so that, e.g., a 45-degree angle would be referred to as half of a right angle. The distance scale is relative; one arbitrarily picks a line with a certain length as the unit, and other distances are expressed in relation to it.   A line in Euclidean geometry is a model of the  real number line . Addition is represented by a construction in which one line is copied onto the end of another line to extend its length, and similarly for subtraction.   Measurements of area and volume are derived from distances. For example, a rectangle with a width of 3 and a length of 4 has an area that represents the product, 12. Because this geometrical interpretation of multiplication was limited to three dimensions, there was no direct way of interpreting the product of four or more numbers, and Euclid avoided such products, although they are implied, e.g., in the proof of book IX, proposition 20.          An example of congruence. The two figures on the left are congruent, while the third is  similar  to them. The last figure is neither. Note that congruences alter some properties, such as location and orientation, but leave others unchanged, like  distance  and  angles . The latter sort of properties are called  invariants  and studying them is the essence of geometry.       Euclid refers to a pair of lines, or a pair of planar or solid figures, as ""equal"" () if their lengths, areas, or volumes are equal, and similarly for angles. The stronger term "" congruent "" refers to the idea that an entire figure is the same size and shape as another figure. Alternatively, two figures are congruent if one can be moved on top of the other so that it matches up with it exactly. (Flipping it over is allowed.) Thus, for example, a 2x6 rectangle and a 3x4 rectangle are equal but not congruent, and the letter R is congruent to its mirror image. Figures that would be congruent except for their differing sizes are referred to as  similar .     [ edit ]   Notation and terminology     [ edit ]   Naming of points and figures   Points are customarily named using capital letters of the alphabet. Other figures, such as lines, triangles, or circles, are named by listing a sufficient number of points to pick them out unambiguously from the relevant figure, e.g., triangle ABC would typically be a triangle with vertices at points A, B, and C.     [ edit ]   Complementary and supplementary angles   Angles whose sum is a right angle are called  complementary , those whose sum is two right angles  supplementary .     [ edit ]   Modern versions of Euclid's notation   In modern terminology, angles would normally be measured in  degrees  or  radians .   Modern school textbooks often define separate figures called  lines  (infinite),  rays  (semi-infinite), and  line segments  (of finite length). Euclid, rather than discussing a ray as an object that extends to infinity in one direction, would normally use locutions such as ""if the line is extended to a sufficient length,"" although he occasionally referred to ""infinite lines."" A ""line"" in Euclid could be either straight or curved, and he used the more specific term ""straight line"" when necessary.     [ edit ]   Some important or well known results                   The  bridge of asses  theorem states that A=B and C=D.                     The sum of angles A, B, and C is equal to 180 degrees.                     The Pythagorean theorem: The sum of the areas of the two squares on the legs ( a  and  b ) equals the area of the square on the hypotenuse ( c ).                     Thales' theorem: if AC is a diameter, then the angle at B is a right angle.               [ edit ]   The bridge of asses   The  bridge of asses  ( pons asinorum ) states that  In isosceles triangles the angles at the base equal one another, and, if the equal straight lines are produced further, then the angles under the base equal one another. [ 6 ]  Its name is attributed to its frequent role as the first real test in the Elements of the intelligence of the reader and as a bridge to the harder propositions that followed.          Congruence of triangles is determined by specifying two sides and the angle between them (SAS), two angles and the side between them (ASA) or two angles and a corresponding adjacent side (AAS). Specifying two sides and an adjacent angle (SSA), however, can yield two distinct possible triangles.         [ edit ]   Congruence of triangles   Triangles are congruent if they have all three sides equal (SSS), two sides and the angle between them (SAS), or two angles and a side (AAS) (Book I, propositions 4, 8, and 26). (Triangles with three equal angles are generally similar, but not necessarily congruent. Triangles with two equal sides and an adjacent angle are not necessarily equal.)     [ edit ]   Sum of the angles of a triangle   The sum of the angles of a triangle is equal to two right angles (180 degrees). [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   The Pythagorean theorem   The celebrated  Pythagorean theorem  (book I, proposition 47) states that in any right triangle, the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares whose sides are the two legs (the two sides that meet at a right angle).     [ edit ]   Thales' theorem   Thales' theorem (book I, proposition 32, named after  Thales of Miletus ) states that if A, B and C are points on a circle where the line AC is a diameter of the circle, then the angle ABC is a right angle. Tradition has it that Thales sacrificed an ox to celebrate this theorem. [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Infinitude of prime numbers   ""Prime numbers are more than any any assigned multitude of prime numbers,"" [ 9 ]  i.e., there are infinitely many prime numbers (book IX, proposition 20).     [ edit ]   Summation of geometrical series   For  , the sum of the partial  geometric series  is [ 10 ]           [ edit ]   Scaling of area and volume   In modern terminology, the area of a plane figure is proportional to the square of any of its linear dimensions,  , and the volume of a solid to the cube,  . Euclid proved these results in various special cases, e.g., for the area of a circle, [ 11 ]  and the volume of a parallelepipedal solid [ 12 ] . Euclid determined some, but not all, of the relevant constants of proportionality. E.g., it was his successor  Archimedes  who proved that a sphere has 2/3 the volume of the circumscribing cylinder. [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   Applications             Please help  improve this section  by expanding it.  Further information might be found on the  talk page .       Because of Euclidean geometry's fundamental status in mathematics, it would be impossible to give more than a representative sampling of applications here.                   A surveyor uses a  theodolite                     Sphere packing  applies to a stack of  oranges .                     A parabolic mirror brings parallel rays of light to a focus.             One of the earliest reasons for interest in geometry was  surveying , [ 14 ]  and certain practical results from Euclidean geometry, such as the right-angle property of the 3-4-5 triangle, were probably used long before they were proved formally. The fundamental types of measurements in Euclidean geometry are distances and angles, and both of these quantities can be measured directly by a surveyor. Historically, distances were often measured by chains such as  Gunter's chain , and angles using graduated circles and, later, the  theodolite .   An application of Euclidean solid geometry is the determination of packing arrangements, such as the problem of finding the most efficient  packing of spheres  in n dimensions. This problem has applications in  error detection and correction .   Geometric optics  uses Euclidean geometry to analyze the focusing of light by lenses and mirrors.                   Geometry is used in art and architecture.                     The water tower consists of a cone, a cylinder, and a hemisphere. Its volume can be calculated using solid geometry.                     Geometry can be used to design  origami .             Geometry is used extensively in architecture.   Geometry can be used to design  origami . Some  classical construction problems of geometry  are impossible using  compass and straightedge , but can be solved using origami. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Later work     [ edit ]   The 17th century: Descartes   Ren Descartes (1596-1650) developed  analytic geometry , an alternative method for formalizing geometry. [ 16 ]  In this approach, a point is represented by its  Cartesian  (x,y) coordinates, a line is represented by its equation, and so on. In Euclid's original approach, the  Pythagorean theorem  follows from Euclid's axioms. In the Cartesian approach, the axioms are the axioms of algebra, and the equation expressing the Pythagorean theorem is then a definition of one of the terms in Euclid's axioms, which are now considered to be theorems. The equation: defining the distance between two points  P  = ( p , q )  and  Q  = ( r , s )  is then known as the  Euclidean  metric , and other metrics define  non-Euclidean geometries .          Squaring the circle: the areas of this square and this circle are equal. In 1882, it was proven that this figure cannot be constructed in a finite number of steps with an idealized  compass and straightedge .       In terms of analytic geometry, the restriction of classical geometry to compass and straightedge constructions means a restriction to first- and second-order equations, e.g., y=2x+1 (a line), or x 2 +y 2 =7 (a circle).     [ edit ]   The 18th century   Geometers of the 18th century struggled to define the boundaries of the Euclidean system. Many tried in vain to prove the fifth postulate from the first four. By 1763 at least 28 different proofs had been published, but all were found to be incorrect. [ 17 ]   Leading up to this period, geometers also tried to determine what constructions could be accomplished in Euclidean geometry. For example, the problem of  trisecting an angle  with a compass and straightedge is one that naturally occurs within the theory, since the axioms refer to constructive operations that can be carried out with those tools. However, centuries of efforts failed to find a solution to this problem, until  Pierre Wantzel  published a proof in 1837 that such a construction was impossible. Other constructions proved to be impossible include  doubling the cube  and  squaring the circle . In the case of doubling the cube, the impossibility of the construction originates from the fact that the compass and straightedge method involve first- and second-order equations, while doubling a cube requires the solution of a third-order equation.   Euler  discussed a generalization of Euclidean geometry called  affine geometry , which retains the fifth postulate unmodified while weakening postulates three and four in a way that eliminates the notions of angle (whence right triangles become meaningless) and of equality of length of line segments in general (whence circles become meaningless) while retaining the notions of parallelism as an equivalence relation between lines, and equality of length of parallel line segments (so line segments continue to have a midpoint).     [ edit ]   The 19th century and noneuclidean geometry   Around 1830, the  Jnos Bolyai  and  Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky  separately published work on  noneuclidean geometry , in which the parallel postulate is not valid. [ 18 ]  Since noneuclidean geometry is provably self-consistent, the parallel postulate cannot be proved from the other postulates.   In the 19th century, it was also realized that Euclid's ten axioms and common notions do not suffice to prove all of theorems stated in the  Elements . For example, Euclid assumed implicitly that any line contains at least two points, but this assumption cannot be proved from the other axioms, and therefore needs to be an axiom itself. The very first geometric proof in the  Elements,  shown in the figure above, is that any line segment is part of a triangle; Euclid constructs this in the usual way, by drawing circles around both endpoints and taking their intersection as the third  vertex . His axioms, however, do not guarantee that the circles actually intersect, because they are consistent with discrete, rather than continuous, space. Starting with  Moritz Pasch  in 1882, many improved axiomatic systems for geometry have been proposed, the best known being those of  Hilbert , [ 19 ]   George Birkhoff , [ 20 ]  and  Tarski . [ 21 ]     [ edit ]   The 20th century and general relativity          A disproof of Euclidean geometry as a description of physical space. In a 1919 test of the general theory of relativity, stars (marked with short horizontal lines) were photographed during a solar  eclipse . The rays of starlight were bent by the Sun's gravity on their way to the earth. This is interpreted as evidence in favor of Einstein's prediction that gravity would cause deviations from Euclidean geometry.       Euclid believed that his axioms were self-evident statements about physical reality. Taken as a physical description of space, postulate 2 (extending a line) asserts that space does not have holes or boundaries (i.e., space is homogenous); postulate 3 (constructing a circle) asserts that space is infinite, [ 22 ]  since there is no limit on the radius of the circle; 4 (equality of right angles) says that space is homogeneous and isotropic, so that figures may be moved to any location while maintaining congruence; and 5 that space is flat. [ 23 ]   However,  Einstein's  theory of  general relativity  shows that the true geometry of spacetime is  non-Euclidean geometry . [ 24 ]  For example, if a triangle is constructed out of three rays of light, then in general the interior angles do not add up to 180 degrees due to gravity. A relatively weak gravitational field, such as the Earth's or the sun's, is represented by a metric that is approximately, but not exactly, Euclidean. Until the 20th century, there was no technology capable of detecting the deviations from Euclidean geometry, but Einstein predicted that such deviations would exist. They were later verified by observations such as the observation of the slight bending of starlight by the Sun during a solar eclipse in 1919, and  non-Euclidean geometry  is now, for example, an integral part of the software that runs the  GPS  system. [ 25 ]  It is possible to object to the non-Euclidean interpretation of general relativity on the grounds that light rays might be improper physical models of Euclid's lines, or that relativity could be rephrased so as to avoid the geometrical interpretations. However, one of the consequences of Einstein's theory is that there is no possible physical test that can do any better than a beam of light as a model of geometry. Thus, the only logical possibilities are to accept  non-Euclidean geometry  as physically real, or to reject the entire notion of physical tests of the axioms of geometry, which can then be imagined as a formal system without any intrinsic real-world meaning.     [ edit ]   Treatment of infinity     [ edit ]   Infinite objects   Euclid sometimes distinguished explicitly between ""finite lines"" (e.g., Postulate 2) and "" infinite  lines"" (book I, proposition 12). However, he typically did not make such distinctions unless they were necessary. The postulates do not explicitly refer to infinite lines, although for example some commentators interpret postulate 3, existence of a circle with any radius, as implying that space is infinite. [ 26 ]   The notion of  infinitesimally small quantities  had previously been discussed extensively by the  Eleatic School , but nobody had been able to put them on a firm logical basis, with paradoxes such as  Zeno's paradox  occurring that had not been resolved to universal satisfaction. Euclid used the  method of exhaustion  rather than infinitesimals. [ 27 ]   Later ancient commentators such as  Proclus  (410-485 CE) treated many questions about infinity as issues demanding proof and, e.g., Proclus claimed to prove the infinite divisibility of a line, based on a proof by contradiction in which he considered the cases of even and odd numbers of points constituting it. [ 28 ]   At the turn of the 20th century,  Giuseppe Veronese  produced controversial work on  non-Archimedean  models of Euclidean geometry, in which the distance between two points may be infinite or infinitesimal, in the  Newton - Leibniz  sense. [ 29 ]  Fifty years later,  Abraham Robinson  provided a rigorous logical foundation for Veronese's work. [ 30 ]     [ edit ]   Infinite processes   One reason that the ancients treated the parallel postulate as less certain than the others is that verifying it physically would require us to inspect two lines to check that they never intersected, even at some very distant point, and this inspection could potentially take an infinite amount of time. [ 31 ]   The modern formulation of  proof by induction  was not developed until the 17th century, but later commentators consider it to be implicit in some of Euclid's proofs, e.g., the proof of the infinitude of primes. [ 32 ]     [ edit ]   Logical basis   Euclid frequently used the method of  proof by contradiction , and therefore the traditional presentation of Euclidean geometry assumes  classical logic , in which every proposition is either true or false, i.e., for any proposition P, the proposition ""P or not P"" is automatically true.   Tarski  (1902-1983) and his students demonstrated for the first time that Euclidean geometry can be expressed as a  first-order theory . That is, it can be written entirely in a form that allows statements such as ""for all triangles ..."", without those like ""for all  sets  of triangles ..."" This is important because it shows that the subject does not depend on  set theory  for its logical basis. Tarski proved his  axiomatic formulation  of Euclidean geometry to be complete in a certain  sense : there is an algorithm which, for every proposition, can show it to be either true or false. [ 33 ]  (This does not not violate  Gdel's theorem , because Euclidean geometry cannot describe a sufficient amount of  arithmetic  for the theorem to apply.

Euclidean geometry  is a mathematical system attributed to the  Greek mathematician   Euclid  of  Alexandria .  Euclid's  Elements  is the earliest known systematic discussion of  geometry . It has been one of the most influential books in history, as much for its method as for its mathematical content. The method consists of assuming a small set of intuitively appealing  axioms , and then proving many other  propositions  ( theorems ) from those axioms. Although many of Euclid's results had been stated by earlier Greek mathematicians, Euclid was the first to show how these propositions could be fit together into a comprehensive deductive and  logical system .The  Elements  begin with  plane geometry , still taught in  secondary school  as the first  axiomatic system  and the first examples of  formal proof . It goes on to the  solid geometry  of three  dimensions . Much of the  Elements  states results of what is now called  number theory , proved using geometrical methods.   For over two thousand years, the adjective ""Euclidean"" was unnecessary because no other sort of geometry had been conceived. Euclid's axioms seemed so intuitively obvious that any theorem proved from them was deemed true in an absolute sense. Today, however, many other  self-consistent   non-Euclidean geometries  are known, the first ones having been discovered in the early 19th century. It also is no longer taken for granted that Euclidean geometry describes physical space. An implication of  Einstein 's theory of  general relativity  is that Euclidean geometry is a good approximation to the properties of physical space only if the  gravitational field  is not too strong.

Its superiority over earlier treatments was rapidly recognized, with the result that there was little interest in preserving the earlier ones, and they are now nearly all lost.   Books I-IV discuss plane geometry. Many results about plane figures are proved, e.g.,  If a triangle has two equal angles, then the sides subtended by the angles are equal.  The  Pythagorean theorem  is proved. [ 2 ]   Books V-X deal with number theory, with numbers treated geometrically via their representation as line segments with various lengths. Notions such as  prime numbers  and  rational  and  irrational  numbers are introduced. The infinitude of prime numbers is proved.   Books XI-XIII concern solid geometry. A typical result is the 1:3 ratio between the volume of a cone and a cylinder with the same height and base.     [ edit ]   Axiomatic treatment          A proof from Euclid's elements that, given a line segment, an equilateral triangle exists that includes the segment as one of its sides. The proof is by construction: an equilateral triangle  is made by drawing circles  and  centered on the points  and , and taking one intersection of the circles as the third vertex of the triangle.       Euclidean geometry is an  axiomatic system , in which all  theorems  (""true statements"") are derived from a small number of axioms. Near the beginning of the first book of the  Elements , Euclid gives five  postulates  (axioms) for plane geometry: [ 3 ]     Let the following be postulated: to draw a  straight line  from any  point  to any point.   To produce [extend] a  finite straight line  continuously in a straight line.   To describe a  circle  with any center and distance [radius].   That all right angles are equal to one another.   The  parallel postulate : That, if a straight line falling on two straight lines make the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which are the angles less than the two right angles.     The  Elements  also include the following five ""common notions"":     Things that equal the same thing also equal one another.   If equals are added to equals, then the wholes are equal.   If equals are subtracted from equals, then the remainders are equal.   Things that coincide with one another equal one another.   The whole is greater than the part.       [ edit ]   Constructive approach   Euclidean geometry is  constructive . Postulates 1, 2, 3, and 5 assert the existence and uniqueness of certain geometric figures, and these assertions are of a constructive nature: that is, we are not only told that certain things exist, but are also given methods for creating them with no more than a  compass and an unmarked straightedge . [ 4 ]  In this sense, Euclidean geometry is more concrete than many modern axiomatic systems such as  set theory , which often assert the existence of objects without saying how to construct them, or even assert the existence of objects that cannot be constructed within the theory. Strictly speaking, the lines on paper are  models  of the objects defined within the formal system, rather than instances of those objects. For example a Euclidean straight line has no width, but any real drawn line will. Although  nonconstructive methods  are today considered by nearly all mathematicians to be just as sound as constructive ones, Euclid's constructive proofs often supplanted fallacious nonconstructive ones, e.g., some of the Pythagoreans' proofs involving irrational numbers, which usually required a statement such as ""Find the greatest common measure of ..."" [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   The parallel postulate       Main article:  Parallel postulate              The parallel postulate: If two lines intersect a third in such a way that the sum of the inner angles on one side is less than two right angles, then the two lines inevitably must intersect each other on that side if extended far enough.       To the ancients, the parallel postulate seemed less obvious than the others. Euclid himself seems to have considered it as being qualitatively different from the others, as evidenced by the organization of the  Elements : the first 28 propositions he presents are those that can be proved without it.   Many alternative axioms can be formulated that have the same logical consequences as the parallel postulate. For example  Playfair's axiom  states:     Through a point not on a given straight line, at most one line can be drawn that never meets the given line.       [ edit ]   System of measurement and arithmetic   Euclidean geometry has two fundamental types of measurements: angle and distance. The angle scale is absolute, and Euclid uses the right angle as his basic unit, so that, e.g., a 45-degree angle would be referred to as half of a right angle. The distance scale is relative; one arbitrarily picks a line with a certain length as the unit, and other distances are expressed in relation to it.   A line in Euclidean geometry is a model of the  real number line . Addition is represented by a construction in which one line is copied onto the end of another line to extend its length, and similarly for subtraction.   Measurements of area and volume are derived from distances. For example, a rectangle with a width of 3 and a length of 4 has an area that represents the product, 12. Because this geometrical interpretation of multiplication was limited to three dimensions, there was no direct way of interpreting the product of four or more numbers, and Euclid avoided such products, although they are implied, e.g., in the proof of book IX, proposition 20.          An example of congruence. The two figures on the left are congruent, while the third is  similar  to them. The last figure is neither. Note that congruences alter some properties, such as location and orientation, but leave others unchanged, like  distance  and  angles . The latter sort of properties are called  invariants  and studying them is the essence of geometry.       Euclid refers to a pair of lines, or a pair of planar or solid figures, as ""equal"" () if their lengths, areas, or volumes are equal, and similarly for angles. The stronger term "" congruent "" refers to the idea that an entire figure is the same size and shape as another figure. Alternatively, two figures are congruent if one can be moved on top of the other so that it matches up with it exactly. (Flipping it over is allowed.) Thus, for example, a 2x6 rectangle and a 3x4 rectangle are equal but not congruent, and the letter R is congruent to its mirror image. Figures that would be congruent except for their differing sizes are referred to as  similar .     [ edit ]   Notation and terminology     [ edit ]   Naming of points and figures   Points are customarily named using capital letters of the alphabet. Other figures, such as lines, triangles, or circles, are named by listing a sufficient number of points to pick them out unambiguously from the relevant figure, e.g., triangle ABC would typically be a triangle with vertices at points A, B, and C.     [ edit ]   Complementary and supplementary angles   Angles whose sum is a right angle are called  complementary , those whose sum is two right angles  supplementary .     [ edit ]   Modern versions of Euclid's notation   In modern terminology, angles would normally be measured in  degrees  or  radians .   Modern school textbooks often define separate figures called  lines  (infinite),  rays  (semi-infinite), and  line segments  (of finite length). Euclid, rather than discussing a ray as an object that extends to infinity in one direction, would normally use locutions such as ""if the line is extended to a sufficient length,"" although he occasionally referred to ""infinite lines."" A ""line"" in Euclid could be either straight or curved, and he used the more specific term ""straight line"" when necessary.     [ edit ]   Some important or well known results                   The  bridge of asses  theorem states that A=B and C=D.                     The sum of angles A, B, and C is equal to 180 degrees.                     The Pythagorean theorem: The sum of the areas of the two squares on the legs ( a  and  b ) equals the area of the square on the hypotenuse ( c ).                     Thales' theorem: if AC is a diameter, then the angle at B is a right angle.               [ edit ]   The bridge of asses   The  bridge of asses  ( pons asinorum ) states that  In isosceles triangles the angles at the base equal one another, and, if the equal straight lines are produced further, then the angles under the base equal one another. [ 6 ]  Its name is attributed to its frequent role as the first real test in the Elements of the intelligence of the reader and as a bridge to the harder propositions that followed.          Congruence of triangles is determined by specifying two sides and the angle between them (SAS), two angles and the side between them (ASA) or two angles and a corresponding adjacent side (AAS). Specifying two sides and an adjacent angle (SSA), however, can yield two distinct possible triangles.         [ edit ]   Congruence of triangles   Triangles are congruent if they have all three sides equal (SSS), two sides and the angle between them (SAS), or two angles and a side (AAS) (Book I, propositions 4, 8, and 26). (Triangles with three equal angles are generally similar, but not necessarily congruent. Triangles with two equal sides and an adjacent angle are not necessarily equal.)     [ edit ]   Sum of the angles of a triangle   The sum of the angles of a triangle is equal to two right angles (180 degrees). [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   The Pythagorean theorem   The celebrated  Pythagorean theorem  (book I, proposition 47) states that in any right triangle, the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares whose sides are the two legs (the two sides that meet at a right angle).     [ edit ]   Thales' theorem   Thales' theorem (book I, proposition 32, named after  Thales of Miletus ) states that if A, B and C are points on a circle where the line AC is a diameter of the circle, then the angle ABC is a right angle. Tradition has it that Thales sacrificed an ox to celebrate this theorem. [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Infinitude of prime numbers   ""Prime numbers are more than any any assigned multitude of prime numbers,"" [ 9 ]  i.e., there are infinitely many prime numbers (book IX, proposition 20).     [ edit ]   Summation of geometrical series   For  , the sum of the partial  geometric series  is [ 10 ]           [ edit ]   Scaling of area and volume   In modern terminology, the area of a plane figure is proportional to the square of any of its linear dimensions,  , and the volume of a solid to the cube,  . Euclid proved these results in various special cases, e.g., for the area of a circle, [ 11 ]  and the volume of a parallelepipedal solid [ 12 ] . Euclid determined some, but not all, of the relevant constants of proportionality. E.g., it was his successor  Archimedes  who proved that a sphere has 2/3 the volume of the circumscribing cylinder. [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   Applications   Because of Euclidean geometry's fundamental status in mathematics, it would be impossible to give more than a representative sampling of applications here.                   A surveyor uses a  theodolite                     Sphere packing  applies to a stack of  oranges .                     A parabolic mirror brings parallel rays of light to a focus.             One of the earliest reasons for interest in geometry was  surveying , [ 14 ]  and certain practical results from Euclidean geometry, such as the right-angle property of the 3-4-5 triangle, were probably used long before they were proved formally. The fundamental types of measurements in Euclidean geometry are distances and angles, and both of these quantities can be measured directly by a surveyor. Historically, distances were often measured by chains such as  Gunter's chain , and angles using graduated circles and, later, the  theodolite .   An application of Euclidean solid geometry is the determination of packing arrangements, such as the problem of finding the most efficient  packing of spheres  in n dimensions. This problem has applications in  error detection and correction .   Geometric optics  uses Euclidean geometry to analyze the focusing of light by lenses and mirrors.                   Geometry is used in art and architecture.                     The water tower consists of a cone, a cylinder, and a hemisphere. Its volume can be calculated using solid geometry.                     Geometry can be used to design  origami .             Geometry is used extensively in architecture.   Geometry can be used to design  origami . Some  classical construction problems of geometry  are impossible using  compass and straightedge , but can be solved using origami. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Later work     [ edit ]   The 17th century: Descartes   Ren Descartes (1596-1650) developed  analytic geometry , an alternative method for formalizing geometry. [ 16 ]  In this approach, a point is represented by its  Cartesian  (x,y) coordinates, a line is represented by its equation, and so on. In Euclid's original approach, the  Pythagorean theorem  follows from Euclid's axioms. In the Cartesian approach, the axioms are the axioms of algebra, and the equation expressing the Pythagorean theorem is then a definition of one of the terms in Euclid's axioms, which are now considered to be theorems. The equation: defining the distance between two points  P  = ( p , q )  and  Q  = ( r , s )  is then known as the  Euclidean  metric , and other metrics define  non-Euclidean geometries .          Squaring the circle: the areas of this square and this circle are equal. In 1882, it was proven that this figure cannot be constructed in a finite number of steps with an idealized  compass and straightedge .       In terms of analytic geometry, the restriction of classical geometry to compass and straightedge constructions means a restriction to first- and second-order equations, e.g., y=2x+1 (a line), or x 2 +y 2 =7 (a circle).     [ edit ]   The 18th century   Geometers of the 18th century struggled to define the boundaries of the Euclidean system. Many tried in vain to prove the fifth postulate from the first four. By 1763 at least 28 different proofs had been published, but all were found to be incorrect. [ 17 ]   Leading up to this period, geometers also tried to determine what constructions could be accomplished in Euclidean geometry. For example, the problem of  trisecting an angle  with a compass and straightedge is one that naturally occurs within the theory, since the axioms refer to constructive operations that can be carried out with those tools. However, centuries of efforts failed to find a solution to this problem, until  Pierre Wantzel  published a proof in 1837 that such a construction was impossible. Other constructions proved to be impossible include  doubling the cube  and  squaring the circle . In the case of doubling the cube, the impossibility of the construction originates from the fact that the compass and straightedge method involve first- and second-order equations, while doubling a cube requires the solution of a third-order equation.   Euler  discussed a generalization of Euclidean geometry called  affine geometry , which retains the fifth postulate unmodified while weakening postulates three and four in a way that eliminates the notions of angle (whence right triangles become meaningless) and of equality of length of line segments in general (whence circles become meaningless) while retaining the notions of parallelism as an equivalence relation between lines, and equality of length of parallel line segments (so line segments continue to have a midpoint).     [ edit ]   The 19th century and noneuclidean geometry   Around 1830, the  Jnos Bolyai  and  Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky  separately published work on  noneuclidean geometry , in which the parallel postulate is not valid. [ 18 ]  Since noneuclidean geometry is provably self-consistent, the parallel postulate cannot be proved from the other postulates.   In the 19th century, it was also realized that Euclid's ten axioms and common notions do not suffice to prove all of theorems stated in the  Elements . For example, Euclid assumed implicitly that any line contains at least two points, but this assumption cannot be proved from the other axioms, and therefore needs to be an axiom itself. The very first geometric proof in the  Elements,  shown in the figure above, is that any line segment is part of a triangle; Euclid constructs this in the usual way, by drawing circles around both endpoints and taking their intersection as the third  vertex . His axioms, however, do not guarantee that the circles actually intersect, because they are consistent with discrete, rather than continuous, space. Starting with  Moritz Pasch  in 1882, many improved axiomatic systems for geometry have been proposed, the best known being those of  Hilbert , [ 19 ]   George Birkhoff , [ 20 ]  and  Tarski . [ 21 ]     [ edit ]   The 20th century and general relativity          A disproof of Euclidean geometry as a description of physical space. In a 1919 test of the general theory of relativity, stars (marked with short horizontal lines) were photographed during a solar  eclipse . The rays of starlight were bent by the Sun's gravity on their way to the earth. This is interpreted as evidence in favor of Einstein's prediction that gravity would cause deviations from Euclidean geometry.       Euclid believed that his axioms were self-evident statements about physical reality. Taken as a physical description of space, postulate 2 (extending a line) asserts that space does not have holes or boundaries (i.e., space is homogenous); postulate 3 (constructing a circle) asserts that space is infinite, [ 22 ]  since there is no limit on the radius of the circle; 4 (equality of right angles) says that space is homogeneous and isotropic, so that figures may be moved to any location while maintaining congruence; and 5 that space is flat. [ 23 ]   However,  Einstein's  theory of  general relativity  shows that the true geometry of spacetime is  non-Euclidean geometry . [ 24 ]  For example, if a triangle is constructed out of three rays of light, then in general the interior angles do not add up to 180 degrees due to gravity. A relatively weak gravitational field, such as the Earth's or the sun's, is represented by a metric that is approximately, but not exactly, Euclidean. Until the 20th century, there was no technology capable of detecting the deviations from Euclidean geometry, but Einstein predicted that such deviations would exist. They were later verified by observations such as the observation of the slight bending of starlight by the Sun during a solar eclipse in 1919, and  non-Euclidean geometry  is now, for example, an integral part of the software that runs the  GPS  system. [ 25 ]  It is possible to object to the non-Euclidean interpretation of general relativity on the grounds that light rays might be improper physical models of Euclid's lines, or that relativity could be rephrased so as to avoid the geometrical interpretations. However, one of the consequences of Einstein's theory is that there is no possible physical test that can do any better than a beam of light as a model of geometry. Thus, the only logical possibilities are to accept  non-Euclidean geometry  as physically real, or to reject the entire notion of physical tests of the axioms of geometry, which can then be imagined as a formal system without any intrinsic real-world meaning.     [ edit ]   Treatment of infinity     [ edit ]   Infinite objects   Euclid sometimes distinguished explicitly between ""finite lines"" (e.g., Postulate 2) and "" infinite  lines."" (book I, proposition 12) However, he typically did not make such distinctions unless they were necessary, and postulates 1, 3, and 4 are consistent with  elliptic geometry , in which there is a finite limit on the length of any line.   The notion of  infinitesimally small quantities  had previously been discussed extensively by the  Eleatic School , but nobody had been able to put them on a firm logical basis, with paradoxes such as  Zeno's paradox  occurring that had not been resolved to universal satisfaction. Euclid used the  method of exhaustion  rather than infinitesimals. [ 26 ]   Later ancient commentators such as  Proclus  (410-485 CE) treated many questions about infinity as issues demanding proof and, e.g., Proclus claimed to prove the infinite divisibility of a line, based on a proof by contradiction in which he considered the cases of even and odd numbers of points constituting it. [ 27 ]   At the turn of the 20th century,  Giuseppe Veronese  produced controversial work on  non-Archimedean  models of Euclidean geometry, in which the distance between two points may be infinite or infinitesimal, in the  Newton - Leibniz  sense. [ 28 ]  Fifty years later,  Abraham Robinson  provided a rigorous logical foundation for Veronese's work. [ 29 ]     [ edit ]   Infinite processes   One reason that the ancients treated the parallel postulate as less certain than the others is that verifying it physically would require us to inspect two lines to check that they never intersected, even at some very distant point, and this inspection could potentially take an infinite amount of time. [ 30 ]   The modern formulation of  proof by induction  was not developed until the 17th century, but later commentators consider it to be implicit in some of Euclid's proofs, e.g., the proof of the infinitude of primes. [ 31 ]     [ edit ]   Logical basis   Euclid frequently used the method of  proof by contradiction , and therefore the traditional presentation of Euclidean geometry assumes  classical logic , in which every proposition is either true or false, i.e., for any proposition P, the proposition ""P or not P"" is automatically true.   Tarski  (1902-1983) and his students demonstrated for the first time that Euclidean geometry can be expressed as a  first-order theory . That is, it can be written entirely in a form that allows statements such as ""for all triangles ..."", without those like ""for all  sets  of triangles ..."" This is important because it shows that the subject does not depend on  set theory  for its logical basis. Tarski proved his  axiomatic formulation  of Euclidean geometry to be complete in a certain  sense : there is an algorithm which, for every proposition, can show it to be either true or false. [ 32 ]  (This does not not violate  Gdel's theorem , because Euclidean geometry cannot describe a sufficient amount of  arithmetic  for the theorem to apply.

This source code is written in a programming language. The code may be a modification of an existing source or something completely new. The purpose of programming is to create a program that exhibits a certain desired behavior (customization). The process of writing source codes requires expertise in many different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms and formal logic.

[Image]  PROGRAMMING - COMPUTER VISION TUTORIAL There is an ongoing debate on the extent to which the writing of programs is an art, a craft or an engineering discipline.  Good programming is generally considered to be the measured application of all three, with the goal of producing an efficient and maintainable software solution (the criteria for ""efficient"" and ""maintainable"" vary considerably). The discipline differs from many other technical professions in that programmers generally do not need to be licensed or pass any standardized (or governmentally regulated) certification tests in order to call themselves ""programmers"" or even ""software engineers"". [Video]  An Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) controlled by Skilligent software Another ongoing debate is the extent to which the programming language used in writing programs affects the form that the final program takes.  This debate is analogous to that surrounding the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis  Kenneth E. Iverson, the originator of the APL programming language, believed that the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis applied to computer languages (without actually mentioning the hypothesis by name).  His Turing award lecture, ""Notation as a tool of thought"", was devoted to this theme, arguing that more powerful notations aided thinking about computer algorithms. Iverson K.E.,""  Notation as a tool of thought "",  Communications of the ACM , 23: 444-465 (August 1980).  in linguistics, that postulates that a particular language's nature influences the habitual thought of its speakers. Different language patterns yield different patterns of thought. This idea challenges the possibility of representing the world perfectly with language, because it acknowledges that the mechanisms of any language condition the thoughts of its speaker community.

Al-Jazari's robot was originally a boat with four automatic musicians that floated on a lake to entertain guests at royal drinking parties. His mechanism had a programmable drum machine with pegs (cams) that bump into little levers that operate the percussion. The drummer could be made to play different rhythms and different drum patterns by moving the pegs to different locations.  A 13th Century Programmable Robot  (University of Sheffield).

The Jacquard Loom, developed in 1801, is often quoted as a source of prior art.  The machine used a series of pasteboard cards with holes punched in them.  The hole pattern represented the pattern that the loom had to follow in weaving cloth.  The loom could produce entirely different weaves using different sets of cards. The use of punched cards was also adopted by Charles Babbage around 1830, to control his Analytical Engine. [Video]  Warning Serious Internet Explorer Virus / Phishing scam This innovation was later refined by Herman Hollerith who, in 1896 founded the  Tabulating Machine Company  (which became IBM).  He invented the Hollerith punched card, the card reader, and the key punch machine. These inventions were the foundation of the modern information processing industry. The addition of a plug-board to his 1906 Type I Tabulator allowed it to do different jobs without having to be rebuilt (the first step toward programming). By the late 1940s there were a variety of plug-board programmable machines, called unit record equipment, to perform data processing tasks (card reading).

The invention of the Von Neumann architecture allowed computer programs to be stored in computer memory. Early programs had to be painstakingly crafted using the instructions of the particular machine, often in binary notation. Every model of computer would be likely to need different instructions to do the same task. Later assembly languages were developed that let the programmer specify each instruction in a text format, entering abbreviations for each operation code instead of a number and specifying addresses in symbolic form (e.g. ADD X, TOTAL). In 1954 Fortran, the first higher level programming language, was invented. This allowed programmers to specify calculations by entering a formula directly (e.g. ). The program text, or  source , was converted into machine instructions using a special program called a compiler.  Many other languages were developed, including ones for commercial programming, such as COBOL. Programs were mostly still entered using punch cards or paper tape. (See computer programming in the punch card era). By the late 1960s, data storage devices and computer terminals became inexpensive enough so programs could be created by typing directly into the computers. Text editors were developed that allowed changes and corrections to be made much more easily than with punch cards. [Book]  The Psychology of Computer Programming: Silver Anniversary Edition Dorset House As time has progressed, computers have made giant leaps in the area of processing power. This has brought about newer programming languages that are more abstracted from the underlying hardware. Although these more abstracted languages require additional overhead, in most cases the huge increase in speed of modern computers has brought about little performance decrease compared to earlier counterparts. The benefits of these more abstracted languages is that they allow both an easier learning curve for people less familiar with the older lower-level programming languages, and they also allow a more experienced programmer to develop simple applications quickly. Despite these benefits, large complicated programs, and programs that are more dependent on speed still require the faster and relatively lower-level languages with today's hardware.

Modern programming       Quality requirements   Whatever the approach to the software development may be, the program must finally satisfy some fundamental properties; bearing them in mind while programming reduces the costs in terms of time and/or money due to debugging, further development and user support. Although quality programming can be achieved in a number of ways, following five properties are among the most relevant:    Efficiency : it is referred to the system resource consumption (computer processor, memory, slow devices, networks and to some extent even user interaction) which must be the lowest possible.   Reliability : the results of the program must be correct, which not only implies a correct code implementation but also reduction of error propagation (e.g. resulting from data conversion) and prevention of typical errors (overflow, underflow or zero division).   Robustness : a program must anticipate situations of data type conflict and all other incompatibilities which result in run time errors and stop the program. The focus of this aspect is the interaction with the user and the handling of error messages.   Portability : it should work as it is in any software and hardware environment, or at least without relevant reprogramming.   Readability : the purpose of the main program and of each subroutine must be clearly defined with appropriate comments and self explanatory choice of symbolic names (constants, variables, function names, classes, methods, ...).

In  geometry , the  parallel postulate , also called  Euclid 's fifth postulate  because it is the fifth postulate in  Euclid's  Elements , is a distinctive  axiom  in what is now called  Euclidean geometry . It states that:     If a  line segment  intersects two straight  lines  forming two interior angles on the same side that sum to less than two  right angles , then the two lines, if extended indefinitely, meet on that side on which the angles sum to less than two right angles.     Euclidean geometry  is the study of geometry that satisfies all of Euclid's axioms,  including  the parallel postulate. A geometry where the parallel postulate cannot hold is known as a  non-euclidean geometry . Geometry that is  independent  of Euclid's fifth postulate (i.e., only assumes the first four postulates) is known as  absolute geometry  (or, in other places known as neutral geometry).

Euclid did not postulate the  converse  of his fifth postulate, which is one way to distinguish Euclidean geometry from  elliptic geometry . The Elements contains the proof of an equivalent statement (Book I, Proposition 17):  Any two  angles  of a  triangle  are together less than two  right angles .  The proof depends on an earlier proposition:  In a triangle ABC, the  exterior angle  at C is greater than either of the  interior angles  A or B . This in turn depends on Euclid's unstated assumption that two straight lines meet in only one point, a statement not true of elliptic geometry.   In other words, the converse of the fifth postulate follows from Euclid's axioms minus the fifth postulate, plus an axiom stating that two distinct non-parallel straight lines meet in only one point.     [ edit ]   Logically equivalent properties   Euclid's parallel postulate is equivalent to Playfair's axiom, named after the Scottish  mathematician   John Playfair , which states:     At most one line can be drawn through any point not on a given line  parallel  to the given line in a plane. [ 1 ]     Many other equivalent statements to the parallel postulate or to Playfair's axiom have been suggested, some of them appearing at first to be unrelated to parallelism, and some seeming so  self-evident  that they were  unconsciously  assumed by people who claimed to have proven the parallel postulate from Euclid's other postulates.     The sum of the  angles  in every  triangle  is 180.   There exists a triangle whose angles add up to 180.   The sum of the angles is the same for every triangle.   There exists a pair of  similar , but not  congruent , triangles.   Every triangle can be  circumscribed .   If three angles of a  quadrilateral  are  right angles , then the fourth angle is also a right angle.   There exists a quadrilateral of which all angles are right angles.   There exists a pair of straight lines that are at constant  distance  from each other.   Two lines that are parallel to the same line are also parallel to each other.   Given two parallel lines, any line that intersects one of them also intersects the other.   In a  right-angled triangle , the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides ( Pythagoras' Theorem ).   There is no upper limit to the  area  of a triangle.  [1]     However, the alternatives which employ the word ""parallel"" cease appearing so simple when one is obliged to explain which of the three common definitions of ""parallel"" is meant - constant separation, never meeting or same angles where crossed by a third line - since the equivalence of these three is itself one of the unconsciously obvious assumptions equivalent to Euclid's fifth postulate.     [ edit ]   History   For two thousand years, many attempts were made to prove the parallel postulate using Euclid's first four postulates. The main reason that such a proof was so highly sought after was that the fifth postulate isn't self-evident unlike the other postulates. If the order the postulates were listed in the Elements is significant, it indicates that Euclid included this postulate only when he realised he could not prove it or proceed without it. [ 2 ]   Ibn al-Haytham  (Alhazen) (965-1039), an  Iraqi mathematician , made the first attempt at proving the parallel postulate using a  proof by contradiction , [ 3 ]  where he introduced the concept of  motion  and  transformation  into geometry. [ 4 ]  He formulated the  Lambert quadrilateral , which Boris Abramovich Rozenfeld names the ""Ibn al-HaythamLambert quadrilateral"", [ 5 ]  and his attempted proof also shows similarities to  Playfair's axiom . [ 6 ]   Omar Khayym  (1050-1123) made the first attempt at formulating a non-Euclidean  postulate  as an alternative to the parallel postulate, [ 7 ]  and he was the first to consider the cases of  elliptical geometry  and  hyperbolic geometry , though he excluded the latter. [ 8 ]  The  Khayyam-Saccheri quadrilateral  was also first considered by Omar Khayyam in the late 11th century in Book I of  Explanations of the Difficulties in the Postulates of Euclid . [ 5 ]  Unlike many commentators on Euclid before and after him (including  Giovanni Girolamo Saccheri ), Khayyam was not trying to prove the parallel postulate as such but to derive it from an equivalent postulate: ""Two convergent straight lines intersect and it is impossible for two convergent straight lines to diverge in the direction in which they converge."" [ 9 ]  He recognized that three possibilities arose from omitting Euclid's Fifth; if two perpendiculars to one line cross another line, judicious choice of the last can make the internal angles where it meets the two perpendiculars equal (it is then parallel to the first line). If those equal internal angles are right angles, we get Euclid's Fifth; otherwise, they must be either acute or obtuse. He persuaded himself that the acute and obtuse cases lead to contradiction, but had made a tacit assumption equivalent to the fifth to get there.   Nasir al-Din al-Tusi  (1201-1274), in his  Al-risala al-shafiya'an al-shakk fi'l-khutut al-mutawaziya  ( Discussion Which Removes Doubt about Parallel Lines ) (1250), wrote detailed critiques of the parallel postulate and on Khayym's attempted proof a century earlier. Nasir al-Din attempted to derive a proof by contradiction of the parallel postulate. [ 10 ]  He was also one of the first to consider the cases of elliptical geometry and hyperbolic geometry, though he ruled out both of them. [ 8 ]          Euclidean, elliptical and hyperbolic geometry. The Parallel Postulate is satisfied only for models of Euclidean geometry.       Nasir al-Din's son, Sadr al-Din (sometimes known as ""Pseudo-Tusi""), wrote a book on the subject in 1298, based on Nasir al-Din's later thoughts, which presented one of the earliest arguments for a non-Euclidean hypothesis equivalent to the parallel postulate. ""He essentially revised both the Euclidean system of axioms and postulates and the proofs of many propositions from the  Elements ."" [ 10 ] [ 11 ]  His work was published in  Rome  in 1594 and was studied by European geometers. This work marked the starting point for Saccheri's work on the subject. [ 10 ]   Giordano Vitale  (1633-1711), in his book  Euclide restituo  (1680, 1686), used the Khayyam-Saccheri quadrilateral to prove that if three points are equidistant on the base AB and the summit CD, then AB and CD are everywhere equidistant.  Girolamo Saccheri  (1667-1733) pursued the same line of reasoning more thoroughly, correctly obtaining absurdity from the obtuse case (proceeding, like Euclid, from the implicit assumption that lines can be extended indefinitely and have infinite length), but failing to debunk the acute case (although he managed to wrongly persuade himself that he had).   Where Khayym and Saccheri had attempted to prove Euclid's fifth by disproving the only possible alternatives, the nineteenth century finally saw mathematicians exploring those alternatives and discovering the  logically consistent  geometries which result. In 1829,  Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky  published an account of acute geometry in an obscure Russian journal (later re-published in 1840 in German). In 1831,  Jnos Bolyai  included, in a book by his father, an appendix describing acute geometry, which, doubtlessly, he had developed independently of Lobachevsky.  Carl Friedrich Gauss  had actually studied the problem before that, but he did not publish any of his results. However, upon hearing of Boylai's results in a letter from Bolyai's father,  Farkas Bolyai , he stated:     ""If I commenced by saying that I am unable to praise this work, you would certainly be surprised for a moment. But I cannot say otherwise. To praise it would be to praise myself. Indeed the whole contents of the work, the path taken by your son, the results to which he is led, coincide almost entirely with my meditations, which have occupied my mind partly for the last thirty or thirty-five years."" [ 12 ]     The resulting geometries were later developed by  Lobachevsky ,  Riemann  and  Poincar  into  hyperbolic geometry  (the acute case) and  spherical geometry  (the obtuse case). The  independence  of the parallel postulate from Euclid's other axioms was finally demonstrated by  Eugenio Beltrami  in 1868.     [ edit ]   Criticism   Attempts to logically prove this postulate, rather than the eighth axiom, were criticized by  Schopenhauer , as described in  Schopenhauer's criticism of the proofs of the Parallel Postulate .

clueweb09-en0000-44-05163	     Introduction                                       Euclid's  Elements  form one of the most beautiful and influential works of science in the  history of humankind.  Its beauty lies in its logical development of geometry and other branches of  mathematics.  It has influenced all branches of science but none so much as mathematics and the exact  sciences.  The  Elements  have been studied 24 centuries in many languages starting, of course,  in the original Greek, then in Arabic, Latin, and many modern languages.   I'm creating this version of Euclid's  Elements  for a couple of reasons. The main one is to  rekindle an interest in the  Elements,  and the web is a great way to do that.  Another reason  is to show how Java applets can be used to illustrate geometry.  That also helps to bring the   Elements  alive.   The text of all 13 Books is complete, and all of the figures are illustrated using the Geometry  Applet, even those in the last three books on solid geometry that are three-dimensional. I still have  a lot to write in the guide sections and that will keep me busy for quite a while.   This edition of Euclid's  Elements  uses a Java applet called the Geometry Applet to  illustrate the diagrams.  If you enable Java on your browser, then you'll be able to dynamically  change the diagrams.  In order to see how, please read  Using the Geometry  Applet  before moving on to the  Table of Contents .

clueweb09-en0001-21-02674	"         7: Axioms and Theorems      7.1 Euclid's Axioms and Common Notions   In addition to the great practical value of Euclidean geometry, the ancient Greeks also found great esthetic value in the study of geometry. Much as children assemble a few kinds blocks into many varied towers, mathematicians assemble a few definitions and assumptions into many varied theorems. The blocks are assembled with Hands, the axioms are assembled with Reason.  All of Euclidean geometry (the thousands of theorems) were all put together with a few different kinds of blocks. These are called ""Euclid's five axioms"":      A-1  Every two points lie on exactly one line.      A-2  Any line segment with given endpoints may be continued in either direction.      A-3  It is possible to construct a circle with any point as its center and with a radius of any length. (This implies that there is neither an upper nor lower limit to distance. In-other-words, any distance, no mater how large can always be increased, and any distance, no mater how small can always be divided.)      A-4  If two lines cross such that a pair of adjacent angles are congruent, then each of these angles is also congruent to any other angle formed in the same way.      A-5  (Parallel Axiom): Given a line  l  and a point not on  l , there is one and only one line which contains the point, and is parallel to   l .      In addition to its axiom,  Euclidean geometry is based on a number of  common notions  that Euclid listed in ""The Elements"".  Unlike the axioms which deal with objects of geometry, the common notions are general rules of logic:       CN-1   Things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another.      CN-2   If equals be added to equals, the wholes are equal.      CN-3   If equals be subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal.      CN-4   Things which coincide with one another are equal to one another.      CN-5   The whole is greater than the part.     Euclid's goal was for these axioms and common notions to be (1) few in number, and (2) so obviously true that they could not possible be argued with. For over 2000 years, many mathematicians believed that the fifth axiom (the Parallel Axiom) was not needed. They believed that it could instead be proved as a theorem of the first four axioms. There were numerous attempts to do so. Early in the nineteenth century, three men working independently, finally put an end to this impossible search. These men were Ivanovitch Lobachevski in Russia, Karl Gauss in Germany, and János Bolyai in Hungary. These men each developed theorems using Euclid's first four axioms and a negation of the Parallel Axiom. Their expectation was to eventually develop two theorems which contradicted each other. This would prove that their negation of the Parallel Axiom is inconsistent with the first four axioms - thereby proving the Parallel Axiom (and making it the Parallel Theorem). To their surprise, however, they never obtained a contradiction. Instead, they developed a complete and consistent geometry - a non-Euclidean geometry that is now called hyperbolic geometry. This proved that the Parallel Axiom could not be derived from the other four.This was of great mathematical and philosophical interest. From the time of the Greeks, it was believed that geometric theorems were such pure and perfect Truth that they did not need to be scrutinized by observations of the real world. Now, those statements are only true is some geometries. The only reason to prefer one geometry over another is by comparison to the real world - a heavy blow to a geometor. In the early twentieth century, Albert Einstein developed The General Theory of Relativity which made extensive use of hyperbolic geometry. Thus, abstract, mathematical philosophy was now firmly in the realm of Science.  There are actually two ways to negate the Euclidean Parallel Axiom:     A-5S (Spherical Geometry Parallel Axiom): Given a line  l  and a point not on  l ,  no lines  exist that contain the point, and are parallel to  l .     A-5H (Hyperbolic Geometry Parallel Axiom): Given a line  l  and a point not on  l , there are  at least two  distinct lines which contains the point, and are parallel to  l .      When thinking about these parallel axioms, it is important to remember that ""parallel"" does not mean ""lines that look like train tracks"". ""Parallel"" means two lines in the same plane that, no matter how far extended, do not intersect.  The Spherical Geometry Parallel Axiom is inconsistent with Euclid's first four axioms. In spherical geometry, The ""lines"" are great circles. Most pairs of points (A and B) in spherical geometry, lie on one and only one great circle; however if A and B happen to be antipodal (on opposite ends of any single axis), then there are an infinite number of different great circles that pass through them. This violates Euclid's first axiom. Euclid's second axiom, ""any line segment with given endpoints may be continued in either direction"" is also violated. In spherical geometry, if points the endpoints of a line segment are moved farther and farther apart, then they will eventually coincide.  Contrary to Lobachevski's, Bolyai's, and Gauss' expectations, the hyperbolic geometry Parallel Axiom is perfectly consistent with Euclid's first four axioms. And what a beautiful world this surprise opened up.        7.2 Betweeness and SAS Axioms:   In addition to the axioms and common notions that Euclid included in ""The Elements"",  he unknowingly made a number of implicit assumptions.  One of these is called the Betweeness Axiom and can be stated: ""Of any three points on a line, exactly one is between the other two."" Another is called the SAS (or Side-Angle-Side) Axiom.  The SAS axiom states that if two sides and the included angle of one triangle are congruent to two sides and an included angle of a second triangle, then the two triangles are congruent.  In ""The Elements"", Euclid presents what he believed to be a proof for SAS:[Health-56]  Given:   ABC and  DEF, with sides AB   DE, side AC   DF, and  A    D.  Proof:   Move  ABC such that point A coincides with point D, and line AB coincides with DE.  Point B will coincide with E, because AB   DE.  Also, segment AC will coincide with DF, because  A    D.  Point C will coincide with F, because AC   DF.  Line BC will coincide with EF, because two lines cannot enclose a space.  Finally, side BC is congruent to side EF, because the lines and endpoints of each coincide.  Therefore,  B    E,  C    F, and  ABC    DEF.  The flaw in the above argument is that it depends on the undefined term ""move"". Let ""move"" (in both Euclidean and hyperbolic geometry) be defined as a function that maps a set of points, P1, P2, P3, ... to P'1, P'2, P'3..., in such a way that for any two points Pn and Pm of the original set, the distance from Pn to Pm equals the distance from P'n to P'm. Then, for SAS to hold, it must be that  for any two lines L and L', it is always possible to ""move"" line L so that it coincides with L' . This condition is commonly called the SAS axiom. The SAS axiom and all the other ""implicit assumptions"" in  Euclidean geometry are all axioms of both Euclidean and hyperbolic geometry. [Moise-74]      7.3 Proofs in Hyperbolic Geometry:   Euclid's 5 axioms, the common notions, plus all of his unstated assumptions together make up the complete axiomatic formation of Euclidean geometry.   The only difference between the complete axiomatic formation of Euclidean geometry and of hyperbolic geometry is the Parallel Axiom.   This is a powerful statement. It means that any proof in Euclidean geometry which does not use the Parallel Axiom is also a proof in hyperbolic geometry!  Likewise, it means that Euclidean geometry theorems that require the Parallel Axiom will be false in hyperbolic geometry. A striking example of this is the Euclidean geometry theorem that the sum of the angles of a triangle will always total 180°. Figure 7.3a may help you recall the proof of this theorem - and see why it is false in hyperbolic geometry.    Figure 7.3a: Proof for m A + m B + m C = 180°    In Euclidean geometry, for any triangle ABC, there exists a unique parallel to BC that passes through point A. Additionally, it is a theorem in Euclidean geometry that when two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, then the opposite interior angles are congruent; therefore,  NAB    ABC and  MAC    ACB.    In gyperbolic feometry, however,  there are an infinite number of lines that are parallel to BC and pass through point A, yet there does not exist any line such that both:  NAB    ABC and  MAC     ACB.    7.4 Angle Measure Axioms:   The ancient Greeks considered that measurement was merely one of the practical arts.  It was considered unworthy of the attention of mathematicians and philosophers.

clueweb09-en0000-44-04222	"       Proposition 47      In right-angled triangles the square on the side opposite the right angle equals the sum of the squares on the sides containing the right angle.    Let  ABC  be a right-angled triangle having the angle  BAC  right.  I say that the square on  BC  equals the sum of the squares on  BA  and  AC.    Describe the square  BDEC  on  BC,  and the squares  GB  and  HC  on  BA  and  AC.   Draw  AL  through  A  parallel to either  BD  or  CE,  and join  AD  and  FC.   I.46   I.31   Post.1                                                               Since each of the angles  BAC  and  BAG  is right, it follows that with a straight line  BA,  and at the point  A  on it, the two straight lines  AC  and  AG  not lying on the same side make the adjacent angles equal to two right angles, therefore  CA  is in a straight line with  AG.   I.Def.22   I.14    For the same reason  BA  is also in a straight line with  AH.    Since the angle  DBC  equals the angle  FBA,  for each is right, add the angle  ABC   to each, therefore the whole angle  DBA  equals the whole angle  FBC.   I.Def.22   Post.4   C.N.2    Since  DB  equals  BC,  and  FB  equals  BA,  the two sides  AB  and  BD  equal the two sides  FB  and  BC  respectively, and the angle  ABD  equals the angle  FBC,  therefore the base  AD  equals the base  FC,  and the triangle  ABD  equals the triangle  FBC.   I.Def.22   I.4    Now the parallelogram  BL  is double the triangle  ABD,  for they have the same base  BD  and are in the same parallels  BD  and  AL.   And the square  GB  is double the triangle  FBC,  for they again have the same base  FB  and are in the same parallels  FB  and  GC.   I.41    Therefore the parallelogram  BL  also equals the square  GB.    Similarly, if  AE  and  BK  are joined, the parallelogram  CL  can also be proved equal to the square  HC.   Therefore the whole square  BDEC  equals the sum of the two squares  GB  and  HC.   C.N.2    And the square  BDEC  is described on  BC,  and the squares  GB  and  HC  on  BA  and  AC.   Therefore the square on  BC  equals the sum of the squares on  BA  and  AC.     Therefore  in right-angled triangles the square on the side opposite the right angle equals the sum of the squares on the sides containing the right angle..    Q.E.D.      This proposition is generalized in  VI.31  to arbitrary similar figures placed on the sides of the triangle  ABC.   If the rectilinear figures on the sides of the triangle are similar, then that on the hypotenuse is the sum of the other two figures.   A bit of history  This proposition, I.47, is often called the ""Pythagorean theorem,"" called so by Proclus and others centuries after Pythagoras and even centuries after Euclid.  The statement of the proposition was very likely known to the Pythagoreans if not to Pythagoras himself.  The Pythagoreans and perhaps Pythagoras even knew a proof of it.  But the knowledge of this relation was far older than Pythagoras.   More than a millennium before Pythagoras, the Old Babylonians (ca. 1900-1600 B.C.E) used this relation to solve geometric problems involving right triangles.  Moreover, the tablet known as Plimpton 322 shows that the Old Babylonians could construct all the so-called Pythagorean triples, those triples of numbers  a, b,  and  c  such that  a 2  +  b 2  =  c 2  which describe triangles with integral sides. (The smallest of these is 3, 4, 5.)  For more on Pythagorean triples, see   X.29.Lemma 1 .   The hypotenuse diagram in the  Zhou bi suan jing   The rule for computing the hypotenuse of a right triangle was well known in ancient China.  It is used in the  Zhou bi suan jing,  a work on astronomy and mathematics compiled during the Han period, and in the later important mathematical work  Jiu zhang suan shu  [ Nine Chapters ] to solve right triangles.   The  Zhou bi  includes a very interesting diagram known as the ""hypotenuse diagram.""   This diagram may not have been in the original text but added by its primary commentator Zhao Shuang sometime in the third century C.E. A particular case of this proposition is illustrated by this diagram, namely, the 3-4-5 right triangle.   Place four 3 by 4 rectangles around a 1 by 1 square. A 7 by 7 square results.  The four diagonals of the rectangles bound a tilted square as illustrated.  The area of tilted square is  49 minus 4 times 6 (the 6 is the area of one right triangle with legs 3 and 4), which is 25.  Therefore the tilted square is 5 by 5, and the diagonal of the original 3 by 4 rectangles is 5.   Zhao Shuang referred to the hypotenuse figure in a general way.  He described all the ways the sides, the hypotenuse, and their squares can be found in terms of each other.   The  Zhou bi  has recently been translated into English with an excellent commentary.  See  Astronomy and mathematics in ancient China: the  Zhou bi suan jing, by Christopher Cullin, Cambridge University Press, 1996.     Alternate methods of proof  According to Proclus, the specific proof of this proposition given in the  Elements  is Euclid's own.  It is likely that older proofs depended on the theories of proportion and similarity, and as such this proposition would have to wait until after Books V and VI where those theories are developed.  It appears that Euclid devised this proof so that the proposition could be placed in Book I.   Euclid presents a proof based on proportion and similarity in the  lemma  for proposition X.33.  Compare it, summarized here, to the proof in I.47.       Let  ABC  be a right-angled triangle with a right angle at  A.   Draw  AM  perpendicular to  BC.    According to  VI.8 , the triangles  ABM  and  AMC  are similar both to the whole  ABC  and to one another.  (VI.8 concludes the triangles are similar after showing they have the same angles, see  VI.4 .)  Since triangle  ABC  is similar to triangle  ABD,  therefore, by the definition of similarity  VI.Def.1 ,  CB  is to  BA  as  BA  is to  BM.                                   Next  VI.17  converts this proportion to a statement about areas, namely, the rectangle  CB  by  BM  (which is the parallelogram  BL  in the proof of I.47) equals the square on  AB.   For the same reason the rectangle  BC  by  CM  (which is the parallelogram  CL  in the proof of I.47) also equals the square on  AC.   Therefore the sum of the two rectangles  CB  by  BM  and  BC  by  CM,  which is the square on  BC,  equals the sum of the squares on  AC  and  BC.  Q.E.D.    (Actually, the final sentence is not part of the lemma, probably because Euclid moved that statement to the first Book as I.47.)   So, although Euclid's proof in I.47 may be more complicated than some others, we can see how it well it corresponds to a simpler proof that depends on the theories of proportion and similarity.    Generalizations of I.47     Propositions  II.12  and  II.13  consider triangles other than right triangles.  In II.12 the right angle is replaced by an obtuse angle, while in II.13 the right angle is replaced by an acute angle.  The resulting statements are actually geometric forms of the law of cosines.   Proposition  VI.31  generalizes the figures that can be placed on the sides of the right triangle to any three similar figures instead of the three squares here in I.47.   Use of this proposition   This proposition is used in the next one, which its converse, in propositions  II.9  through II.14 in Book II, and several propositions in the rest of the books on geometry.

clueweb09-enwp00-76-11790	"                     Euclid's lemma          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Euclid lemma )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search          Euclid's lemma  ( Greek    ) is a generalization of Proposition 30 of Book VII of  Euclid's Elements . The  lemma  states that     If a  positive integer   divides  the product of two other positive integers, and the first and second integers are  coprime , then the first integer divides the third integer.     This can be written in notation:     If  n | ab  and  gcd ( n , a ) = 1 then  n | b .     Proposition 30, also known as  Euclid 's first  theorem , states:     If a  prime number  divides the product of two positive integers, then the prime number divides at least one of the positive integers.     That can be written as:     If  p | ab  then  p | a  or  p | b .     Often, proposition 30 is called Euclid's lemma instead of the generalization. A  lemma  is a ""mini"" theorem that is proven and used to prove a bigger theorem. Most of the time in mathematics textbooks Euclid's lemma is used to prove the  fundamental theorem of arithmetic .     [ edit ]   Proof of Proposition 30   Say  p  is a prime factor of  ab , but also state that it is not a factor of  a . Therefore,  , where  r  is the other corresponding factor to produce  ab . As  p  is prime, and also because it is not a factor of  a ,  a  and  p  must be  coprime . This means that two integers  x  and  y  can be found so that   ( Bzout's identity ). Multiply with  b  on both sides:           .     We stated previously that  , and so:           .     Therefore,  p  is a factor of  b . This means that  p  must always exactly divide either  a  or  b  or both.  Q.E.D.

There are several well-known proofs of the theorem.           Contents       1   Euclid's proof   2   Euler's proof   3   See also   4   External links               [ edit ]   Euclid's proof   Euclid offered the following proof published in his work  Elements  (Book IX, Proposition 20) and paraphrased here.   Take any finite list of prime numbers  p 1 ,  p 2 , ...,  p n . It will be shown that some additional prime numbers not in this list exist, as follows:   Let  P  be the product of all the prime numbers:  P  =  p 1 ... p n . Let  q  =  P  + 1: more than this product. Then,  q  is either prime or not.   If  q  is prime then the list is not exhaustive:  q  is not on it.   If  q  is not prime then some prime factor  p  divides  q . This factor  p  is not on our list: if it were, then it would divide  P  (since  P  is the product of every number on the list); but as we know,  p  divides  P  + 1 =  q . Then  p  would have to divide the difference of the two numbers, which is ( P  + 1)   P  or just 1. But no prime number divides 1 so there would be a contradiction, and therefore  p  cannot be on the list. This means at least one more prime number exists beyond those in the list.   This proves that for  any  finite list of prime numbers, there is a prime number not on the list. Therefore there must be infinitely many prime numbers.     [ edit ]   Euler's proof   Another proof, by the Swiss mathematician  Leonhard Euler , relies on the  fundamental theorem of arithmetic : that every number has a unique prime factorization. If  P  is the set of all prime numbers, Euler wrote that:         The first equality is given by the formula for a  geometric series  in each term of the product. To show the second equality, distribute the product over the sum: in the result, every product of primes appears exactly once, so by the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, the sum is equal to the sum over all integers.   The sum on the right is the  harmonic series , which diverges. So the product on the left must diverge also. Since each term of the product is finite, the number of terms must be infinite, so there is an infinite number of primes.

clueweb09-en0001-03-11504	     Introduction                                       Euclid's  Elements  form one of the most beautiful and influential works of science in the  history of humankind.  Its beauty lies in its logical development of geometry and other branches of  mathematics.  It has influenced all branches of science but none so much as mathematics and the exact  sciences.  The  Elements  have been studied 24 centuries in many languages starting, of course,  in the original Greek, then in Arabic, Latin, and many modern languages.   I'm creating this version of Euclid's  Elements  for a couple of reasons. The main one is to  rekindle an interest in the  Elements,  and the web is a great way to do that.  Another reason  is to show how Java applets can be used to illustrate geometry.  That also helps to bring the   Elements  alive.   The text of all 13 Books is complete, and all of the figures are illustrated using the Geometry  Applet, even those in the last three books on solid geometry that are three-dimensional. I still have  a lot to write in the guide sections and that will keep me busy for quite a while.   This edition of Euclid's  Elements  uses a Java applet called the Geometry Applet to  illustrate the diagrams.  If you enable Java on your browser, then you'll be able to dynamically  change the diagrams.  In order to see how, please read  Using the Geometry  Applet  before moving on to the  Table of Contents .

clueweb09-en0000-44-04679	"      Euclid                                     Little is known about Euclid's actual life.  He was living in Alexandria about 300 B.C.E. based on a passage in Proclus'  Commentary on the First Book of Euclid's Elements.   Indeed, much of what is known or conjectured is based on what Proclus says.  After mentioning two students of Plato, Proclus writes    All those who have written histories bring to this point their account of the development of this science.  Not long after these men came Euclid, who brought together the  Elements,  systematizing many of the theorems of Eudoxus, perfecting many of those of Theatetus, and putting in irrefutable demonstrable form propositions that had been rather loosely established by his predecessors.  He lived in the time of Ptolemy the First, for Archimedes, who lived after the time of the first Ptolemy, mentions Euclid.  It is also reported that Ptolemy once asked Euclid if there was not a shorter road to geometry that through the  Elements,  and Euclid replied that there was no royal road to geometry.  He was therefore later than Plato's group but earlier than Eratosthenes and Archimedes, for these two men were contemporaries, as Eratosthenes somewhere says.  Euclid belonged to the persuasion of Plato and was at home in this philosophy; and this is why he thought the goal of the  Elements  as a whole to be the construction of the so-called Platonic figures. (Proclus, ed. Friedlein, p. 68, tr. Morrow)   It is apparent that Proclus had no direct evidence for when Euclid lived, but managed to place him between Plato's students and Archimedes, putting him, very roughly, about 300 B.C.E.  Proclus lived about 800 years later, in the fifth century C.E.   There are a few other historical comments about Euclid.  The most important being Pappus' (fourth century C.E.) comment that Apollonius (third century B.C.E.) studied ""with the students of Euclid at Alexandria.""    Thus, we know almost nothing about Euclid's life.  But we have more of his  writings than any other ancient mathematician.  Besides the  Elements,  there are the  Data, On Divisions of Figures,  the  Phaenomena,  and the  Optics.   All are included in the  Euclidis opera omnia  of Heiberg and Menge (see below) in Greek and translated into Latin.  Other translations are listed below.   Euclid also wrote other books which no longer exist but were mentioned by later writers.  They include  Surface Loci, Porisms, Conics,  and the  Pseudaria  (that is, the  Book of Fallacies ).

In  geometry , the  parallel postulate , also called  Euclid 's fifth postulate  because it is the fifth postulate in  Euclid's  Elements , is a distinctive  axiom  in what is now called  Euclidean geometry . It states that:     If a  line segment  intersects two straight  lines  forming two interior angles on the same side that sum to less than two  right angles , then the two lines, if extended indefinitely, meet on that side on which the angles sum to less than two right angles.     Euclidean geometry  is the study of geometry that satisfies all of Euclid's axioms,  including  the parallel postulate. A geometry where the parallel postulate cannot hold is known as a  non-euclidean geometry . Geometry that is  independent  of Euclid's fifth postulate (i.e., only assumes the first four postulates) is known as  absolute geometry  (or, in other places known as neutral geometry).           Contents       1   Converse of Euclid's parallel postulate   2   Logically equivalent properties   3   History   4   Criticism   5   See also   6   References   7   Further reading               [ edit ]   Converse of Euclid's parallel postulate          If the sum of the two interior angles equals 180, the lines are parallel and will never intersect.       Euclid did not postulate the  converse  of his fifth postulate, which is one way to distinguish Euclidean geometry from  elliptic geometry . The Elements contains the proof of an equivalent statement (Book I, Proposition 17):  Any two  angles  of a  triangle  are together less than two  right angles .  The proof depends on an earlier proposition:  In a triangle ABC, the  exterior angle  at C is greater than either of the  interior angles  A or B . This in turn depends on Euclid's unstated assumption that two straight lines meet in only one point, a statement not true of elliptic geometry.   In other words, the converse of the fifth postulate follows from Euclid's axioms minus the fifth postulate, plus an axiom stating that two distinct non-parallel straight lines meet in only one point.     [ edit ]   Logically equivalent properties   It is often stated that Euclid's parallel postulate is equivalent to Playfair's axiom, named after the Scottish  mathematician   John Playfair , which states:     Exactly one line can be drawn through any point not on a given line  parallel  to the given line in a plane. [ 1 ]     However this can be seen to be false because Euclid's parallel postulate is not inconsistent with elliptical geometry; two lines in an elliptical space intersected by a third line, forming two interior angles on one side with a sum less than two right angles, will meet on that side. That they meet on the other side as well does not contradict the parallel postulate. Playfair's axiom excludes this possibility by assuming that at least one parallel line through a given point does exist, which Euclid wrongly believed could be proven from his other postulates (Elements, Book 1 Proposition 31).   Many other equivalent statements to the parallel postulate or to Playfair's axiom have been suggested, some of them appearing at first to be unrelated to parallelism, and some seeming so  self-evident  that they were  unconsciously  assumed by people who claimed to have proven the parallel postulate from Euclid's other postulates.     The sum of the  angles  in every  triangle  is 180.   There exists a triangle whose angles add up to 180.   The sum of the angles is the same for every triangle.   There exists a pair of  similar , but not  congruent , triangles.   Every triangle can be  circumscribed .   If three angles of a  quadrilateral  are  right angles , then the fourth angle is also a right angle.   There exists a quadrilateral of which all angles are right angles.   There exists a pair of straight lines that are at constant  distance  from each other.   Two lines that are parallel to the same line are also parallel to each other.   Given two parallel lines, any line that intersects one of them also intersects the other.   In a  right-angled triangle , the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides ( Pythagoras' Theorem ).   There is no upper limit to the  area  of a triangle.  [1]     However, the alternatives which employ the word ""parallel"" cease appearing so simple when one is obliged to explain which of the three common definitions of ""parallel"" is meant - constant separation, never meeting or same angles where crossed by a third line - since the equivalence of these three is itself one of the unconsciously obvious assumptions equivalent to Euclid's fifth postulate.     [ edit ]   History   For two thousand years, many attempts were made to prove the parallel postulate using Euclid's first four postulates. The main reason that such a proof was so highly sought after was that the fifth postulate isn't self-evident unlike the other postulates. If the order the postulates were listed in the Elements is significant, it indicates that Euclid included this postulate only when he realised he could not prove it or proceed without it. [ 2 ]   Ibn al-Haytham  (Alhazen) (965-1039), an  Iraqi mathematician , made the first attempt at proving the parallel postulate using a  proof by contradiction , [ 3 ]  where he introduced the concept of  motion  and  transformation  into geometry. [ 4 ]  He formulated the  Lambert quadrilateral , which Boris Abramovich Rozenfeld names the ""Ibn al-HaythamLambert quadrilateral"", [ 5 ]  and his attempted proof also shows similarities to  Playfair's axiom . [ 6 ]   Omar Khayym  (1050-1123) made the first attempt at formulating a non-Euclidean  postulate  as an alternative to the parallel postulate, [ 7 ]  and he was the first to consider the cases of  elliptical geometry  and  hyperbolic geometry , though he excluded the latter. [ 8 ]  The  Khayyam-Saccheri quadrilateral  was also first considered by Omar Khayyam in the late 11th century in Book I of  Explanations of the Difficulties in the Postulates of Euclid . [ 5 ]  Unlike many commentators on Euclid before and after him (including  Giovanni Girolamo Saccheri ), Khayyam was not trying to prove the parallel postulate as such but to derive it from an equivalent postulate: ""Two convergent straight lines intersect and it is impossible for two convergent straight lines to diverge in the direction in which they converge."" [ 9 ]  He recognized that three possibilities arose from omitting Euclid's Fifth; if two perpendiculars to one line cross another line, judicious choice of the last can make the internal angles where it meets the two perpendiculars equal (it is then parallel to the first line). If those equal internal angles are right angles, we get Euclid's Fifth; otherwise, they must be either acute or obtuse. He persuaded himself that the acute and obtuse cases lead to contradiction, but had made a tacit assumption equivalent to the fifth to get there.   Nasir al-Din al-Tusi  (1201-1274), in his  Al-risala al-shafiya'an al-shakk fi'l-khutut al-mutawaziya  ( Discussion Which Removes Doubt about Parallel Lines ) (1250), wrote detailed critiques of the parallel postulate and on Khayym's attempted proof a century earlier. Nasir al-Din attempted to derive a proof by contradiction of the parallel postulate. [ 10 ]  He was also one of the first to consider the cases of elliptical geometry and hyperbolic geometry, though he ruled out both of them. [ 8 ]          Euclidean, elliptical and hyperbolic geometry. The Parallel Postulate is satisfied only for models of Euclidean geometry.       Nasir al-Din's son, Sadr al-Din (sometimes known as ""Pseudo-Tusi""), wrote a book on the subject in 1298, based on Nasir al-Din's later thoughts, which presented one of the earliest arguments for a non-Euclidean hypothesis equivalent to the parallel postulate. ""He essentially revised both the Euclidean system of axioms and postulates and the proofs of many propositions from the  Elements ."" [ 10 ] [ 11 ]  His work was published in  Rome  in 1594 and was studied by European geometers. This work marked the starting point for Saccheri's work on the subject. [ 10 ]   Giordano Vitale  (1633-1711), in his book  Euclide restituo  (1680, 1686), used the Khayyam-Saccheri quadrilateral to prove that if three points are equidistant on the base AB and the summit CD, then AB and CD are everywhere equidistant.  Girolamo Saccheri  (1667-1733) pursued the same line of reasoning more thoroughly, correctly obtaining absurdity from the obtuse case (proceeding, like Euclid, from the implicit assumption that lines can be extended indefinitely and have infinite length), but failing to debunk the acute case (although he managed to wrongly persuade himself that he had).   Where Khayym and Saccheri had attempted to prove Euclid's fifth by disproving the only possible alternatives, the nineteenth century finally saw mathematicians exploring those alternatives and discovering the  logically consistent  geometries which result. In 1829,  Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky  published an account of acute geometry in an obscure Russian journal (later re-published in 1840 in German). In 1831,  Jnos Bolyai  included, in a book by his father, an appendix describing acute geometry, which, doubtlessly, he had developed independently of Lobachevsky.  Carl Friedrich Gauss  had actually studied the problem before that, but he did not publish any of his results. However, upon hearing of Boylai's results in a letter from Bolyai's father,  Farkas Bolyai , he stated:     ""If I commenced by saying that I am unable to praise this work, you would certainly be surprised for a moment. But I cannot say otherwise. To praise it would be to praise myself. Indeed the whole contents of the work, the path taken by your son, the results to which he is led, coincide almost entirely with my meditations, which have occupied my mind partly for the last thirty or thirty-five years."" [ 12 ]     The resulting geometries were later developed by  Lobachevsky ,  Riemann  and  Poincar  into  hyperbolic geometry  (the acute case) and  spherical geometry  (the obtuse case). The  independence  of the parallel postulate from Euclid's other axioms was finally demonstrated by  Eugenio Beltrami  in 1868.     [ edit ]   Criticism   Attempts to logically prove this postulate, rather than the eighth axiom, were criticized by  Schopenhauer , as described in  Schopenhauer's criticism of the proofs of the Parallel Postulate .

It comprises a collection of definitions, postulates ( axioms ), propositions ( theorems  and  constructions ), and  mathematical proofs  of the propositions. The thirteen books cover  Euclidean geometry  and the ancient Greek version of elementary  number theory . With the exception of  Autolycus'   On the Moving Sphere , the  Elements  is one of the oldest extant Greek mathematical treatises [ 1 ]  and it is the oldest extant axiomatic deductive treatment of  mathematics . [ 2 ]  It has proven instrumental in the development of  logic  and modern  science .   Euclid's  Elements  is the most successful [ 3 ] [ 4 ]  and influential [ 5 ]  textbook ever written. Being first set in type in  Venice  in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the  printing press  and is estimated to be second only to the  Bible  in the number of editions published, [ 5 ]  with the number reaching well over one thousand. [ 6 ]  It was used as the basic text on geometry throughout the Western world for about 2,000 years. For centuries, when the  quadrivium  was included in the curriculum of all university students, knowledge of at least part of Euclid's  Elements  was required of all students. Not until the 20th century, by which time its content was universally taught through school books, did it cease to be considered something all educated people had read.

[ edit ]   Basis in earlier work          The frontispiece of an  Adelard of Bath  Latin translation of Euclid's  Elements , c. 13091316; the oldest surviving Latin translation of the  Elements  is a 12th century work by Adelard, which translates to Latin from the Arabic. [ 7 ]       Scholars believe that the  Elements  is largely a collection of theorems proved by other mathematicians supplemented by some original work.  Proclus , a Greek mathematician who lived several centuries after Euclid, wrote in his commentary of the  Elements : ""Euclid, who put together the Elements, collecting many of  Eudoxus ' theorems, perfecting many of  Theaetetus ', and also bringing to irrefragable demonstration the things which were only somewhat loosely proved by his predecessors"".  Pythagoras  was probably the source of most of books I and II,  Hippocrates  of book III, and  Eudoxus  book V, while books IV, VI, XI, and XII probably came from other Pythagorean or Athenian mathematicians. [ 8 ]  Euclid often replaced fallacious proofs with his own, more rigorous versions. [ 9 ]  The use of definitions, postulates, and axioms dated back to  Plato . [ 10 ]  The  Elements  may have been based on an earlier textbook by  Hippocrates of Chios  (not the better known  Hippocrates of Kos ), who also may have originated the use of letters to refer to figures. [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Transmission of the text   In the fourth century C.E.  Theon of Alexandria  produced an edition of Euclid which was so widely used that it became the only surviving source until  Franois Peyrard 's 1808 discovery at the  Vatican  of a manuscript not derived from Theon's.   Although known to, for instance,  Cicero , there is no extant record of the text having been translated into Latin prior to  Boethius  in the fifth or sixth century. [ 7 ]  The Arabs received the  Elements  from the Byzantines in approximately 760; this version, by a pupil of Euclid called  Proclo , was translated into  Arabic  under  Harun al Rashid  circa 800 AD. [ 7 ]  The  Elements  was lost to Christian Europe until ca. 1120, when the English monk  Adelard of Bath  disguised himself as a Muslim student in order to obtain a copy in Muslim  Crdoba . [ 12 ]   The first printed edition appeared in 1482 (based on  Giovanni Campano's  1260 edition), and since then it has been translated into many languages and published in about a thousand different editions. Theon's Greek edition was recovered in 1533. In 1570,  John Dee  provided a widely respected ""Mathematical Preface"", along with copious notes and supplementary material, to the first English edition by  Henry Billingsley .   Copies of the Greek text still exist, some of which can be found in the  Vatican Library  and the  Bodleian Library  in Oxford. The manuscripts available are of variable quality, and invariably incomplete. By careful analysis of the translations and originals, hypotheses have been drawn about the contents of the original text (copies of which are no longer available).   Ancient texts which refer to the  Elements  itself and to other mathematical theories that were current at the time it was written are also important in this process. Such analyses are conducted by  J. L. Heiberg  and Sir  Thomas Little Heath  in their editions of the text.   Also of importance are the  scholia , or annotations to the text. These additions, which often distinguished themselves from the main text (depending on the manuscript), gradually accumulated over time as opinions varied upon what was worthy of explanation or elucidation.     [ edit ]   Influence   The  Elements  is still considered a masterpiece in the application of  logic  to  mathematics . In historical context, it has proven enormously influential in many areas of  science . Scientists  Nicolaus Copernicus ,  Johannes Kepler ,  Galileo Galilei , and Sir  Isaac Newton  were all influenced by the  Elements , and applied their knowledge of it to their work. Mathematicians and philosophers, such as  Bertrand Russell ,  Alfred North Whitehead , and  Baruch Spinoza , have attempted to create their own foundational ""Elements"" for their respective disciplines, by adopting the axiomatized deductive structures that Euclid's work introduced.   The austere beauty of Euclidean geometry has been seen by many in western culture as a glimpse of an otherworldly system of perfection and certainty. Abraham Lincoln kept a copy of Euclid in his saddlebag, and studied it late at night by lamplight; he related that he said to himself,  you never can make a lawyer if you do not understand what demonstrate means; and I left my situation in Springfield, went home to my father's house, and stayed there till I could give any proposition in the six books of Euclid at sight . [ 13 ]   Edna St. Vincent Millay  wrote in her sonnet ""Euclid Alone Has Looked on Beauty Bare:""  O blinding hour, O holy, terrible day, When first the shaft into his vision shone Of light anatomized!   Einstein  recalled a copy of the  Elements  and a magnetic compass as two gifts that had a great influence on him as a boy, referring to the Euclid as the ""holy little geometry book"". [ 14 ]   The success of the  Elements  is due primarily to its logical presentation of most of the mathematical knowledge available to Euclid. Much of the material is not original to him, although many of the proofs are his. However, Euclid's systematic development of his subject, from a small set of axioms to deep results, and the consistency of his approach throughout the  Elements , encouraged its use as a textbook for about 2,000 years. The  Elements  still influences modern geometry books. Further, its logical axiomatic approach and rigorous proofs remain the cornerstone of mathematics.     [ edit ]   Outline of  Elements       Main article:  Euclidean geometry              A proof from Euclid's  Elements  that, given a line segment, an equilateral triangle exists that includes the segment as one of its sides. The proof is by construction: an equilateral triangle  is made by drawing circles  and  centered on the points  and , and taking one intersection of the circles as the third vertex of the triangle.         [ edit ]   Contents of the books          A fragment of Euclid's elements found at  Oxyrhynchus , which is dated to circa 100 AD. The diagram accompanies Proposition 5 of Book II of the  Elements .       Books 1 through 4 deal with plane geometry:     Book 1 contains Euclid's 5 axioms (including the  parallel postulate ) and the basic propositions of geometry: the  pons asinorum  (proposition 5) , the  Pythagorean theorem  (Proposition 47), equality of angles and  areas , parallelism, the sum of the angles in a triangle, and the three cases in which triangles are ""equal"" (have the same area).   Book 2 is commonly called the ""book of geometrical algebra,"" because the most of the propositions are geometric interpretations of algebraic identities, such as  a ( b + c +...) =  ab +  ac  + .. or (2 a + b ) 2  + b 2 = 2( a 2  + ( a + b ) 2 ).   Book 3 deals with circles and their properties:  inscribed  angles,  tangents , the power of a point.   Book 4 constructs the  incircle  and  circumcircle  of a triangle, and constructs  regular polygons  with 4, 5, 6, and 15 sides.     Books 5 through 10 introduce  ratios  and  proportions :     Book 5 is a treatise on proportions of  magnitudes . Proposition 25 has as a special case the  inequality of arithmetic and geometric means .   Book 6 applies proportions to geometry:  Thales' theorem , similar figures.   Book 7 deals strictly with elementary number theory:  divisibility ,  prime numbers ,  Euclid's algorithm  for finding the  greatest common divisor ,  least common multiple . Propositions 30 and 32 together are essentially equivalent to the  fundamental theorem of arithmetic  stating that every positive integer can be written as a product of primes in an essentially unique way, though Euclid would have had trouble stating it in this modern form as he did not use the product of more than 3 numbers.   Book 8 deals with proportions in number theory and  geometric sequences .   Book 9 applies the results of the preceding two books and gives the infinitude of prime numbers (proposition 20), the sum of a  geometric series  (proposition 35), and the construction of even  perfect numbers  (proposition 36).   Book 10 attempts to classify  incommensurable  (in modern language,  irrational ) magnitudes by using the  method of exhaustion , a precursor to  integration .     Books 11 through 13 deal with spatial geometry:     Book 11 generalizes the results of Books 16 to space: perpendicularity, parallelism, volumes of  parallelepipeds .   Book 12 studies volumes of  cones ,  pyramids , and  cylinders  in detail, and shows for example that the volume of a cone is a third of the volume of the corresponding cylinder. It concludes by showing the volume of a  sphere  is proportional to the cube of its radius by approximating it by a union of many pyramids.   Book 13 constructs the five regular  Platonic solids  inscribed in a sphere, calculates the ratio of their edges to the radius of the sphere, and proves that there are no further regular solids.       [ edit ]   Euclid's method and style of presentation   Euclid's axiomatic approach was widely influential.   Euclidean geometry is  constructive .   As was common in ancient mathematical texts, when a proposition needed proof in several different cases, Euclid often proved only one of them (often the most difficult), leaving the others to the reader. Later editors such as  Theon  often interpolated their own proofs of these cases.   Euclid's list of axioms was not exhaustive, but represented the principles that were the most important. His proofs often invoke axiomatic notions which were not originally presented in his list of axioms. [ 15 ]   Euclid's presentation was limited by the mathematical ideas and notations in common currency in his era, and this causes the treatment to seem awkward to the modern reader in some places. For example, there was no notion of an angle greater than two right angles, [ 16 ]  the number 1 was sometimes treated separately from other positive integers, and as multiplication was treated geometrically he did not use the product of more than 3 different numbers. The geometrical treatment of number theory may have been because the alternative would have been the extremely awkward  Alexandrian system of numerals . [ 17 ]   The presentation of each result is given in a stylized form, which originated with Euclid: enunciation, statement, construction, proof, and conclusion. No indication is given of the method of reasoning that led to the result, although the  Data  does provide instruction about how to approach the types of problems encountered in the first four books of the  Elements . [ 18 ]     [ edit ]   Apocrypha   It was not uncommon in ancient time to attribute to celebrated authors works that were not written by them. It is by these means that the  apocryphal  books XIV and XV of the  Elements  were sometimes included in the collection. [ 19 ]  The spurious Book XIV was likely written by  Hypsicles  on the basis of a treatise by  Apollonius . The book continues Euclid's comparison of regular solids inscribed in spheres, with the chief result being that the ratio of the surfaces of the  dodecahedron  and  icosahedron  inscribed in the same sphere is the same as the ratio of their volumes, the ratio being  .   The spurious Book XV was likely written, at least in part, by  Isidore of Miletus . This inferior book covers topics such as counting the number of edges and solid angles in the regular solids, and finding the measure of dihedral angles of faces that meet at an edge.

Euclidean geometry  is a mathematical system attributed to the  Greek mathematician   Euclid  of  Alexandria .  Euclid's  Elements  is the earliest known systematic discussion of  geometry . It has been one of the most influential books in history, as much for its method as for its mathematical content. The method consists of assuming a small set of intuitively appealing  axioms , and then proving many other  propositions  ( theorems ) from those axioms. Although many of Euclid's results had been stated by earlier Greek mathematicians, Euclid was the first to show how these propositions could be fit together into a comprehensive deductive and  logical system .The  Elements  begin with  plane geometry , still taught in  secondary school  as the first  axiomatic system  and the first examples of  formal proof . It goes on to the  solid geometry  of three  dimensions . Much of the  Elements  states results of what is now called  number theory , proved using geometrical methods.   For over two thousand years, the adjective ""Euclidean"" was unnecessary because no other sort of geometry had been conceived. Euclid's axioms seemed so intuitively obvious that any theorem proved from them was deemed true in an absolute sense. Today, however, many other  self-consistent   non-Euclidean geometries  are known, the first ones having been discovered in the early 19th century. It also is no longer taken for granted that Euclidean geometry describes physical space. An implication of  Einstein 's theory of  general relativity  is that Euclidean geometry is a good approximation to the properties of physical space only if the  gravitational field  is not too strong.

Its superiority over earlier treatments was rapidly recognized, with the result that there was little interest in preserving the earlier ones, and they are now nearly all lost.   Books I-IV discuss plane geometry. Many results about plane figures are proved, e.g.,  If a triangle has two equal angles, then the sides subtended by the angles are equal.  The  Pythagorean theorem  is proved. [ 2 ]   Books V-X deal with number theory, with numbers treated geometrically via their representation as line segments with various lengths. Notions such as  prime numbers  and  rational  and  irrational  numbers are introduced. The infinitude of prime numbers is proved.   Books XI-XIII concern solid geometry. A typical result is the 1:3 ratio between the volume of a cone and a cylinder with the same height and base.     [ edit ]   Axiomatic treatment          A proof from Euclid's elements that, given a line segment, an equilateral triangle exists that includes the segment as one of its sides. The proof is by construction: an equilateral triangle  is made by drawing circles  and  centered on the points  and , and taking one intersection of the circles as the third vertex of the triangle.       Euclidean geometry is an  axiomatic system , in which all  theorems  (""true statements"") are derived from a small number of axioms. Near the beginning of the first book of the  Elements , Euclid gives five  postulates  (axioms) for plane geometry: [ 3 ]     Let the following be postulated: to draw a  straight line  from any  point  to any point.   To produce [extend] a  finite straight line  continuously in a straight line.   To describe a  circle  with any center and distance [radius].   That all right angles are equal to one another.   The  parallel postulate : That, if a straight line falling on two straight lines make the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which are the angles less than the two right angles.     The  Elements  also include the following five ""common notions"":     Things that equal the same thing also equal one another.   If equals are added to equals, then the wholes are equal.   If equals are subtracted from equals, then the remainders are equal.   Things that coincide with one another equal one another.   The whole is greater than the part.       [ edit ]   Constructive approach   Euclidean geometry is  constructive . Postulates 1, 2, 3, and 5 assert the existence and uniqueness of certain geometric figures, and these assertions are of a constructive nature: that is, we are not only told that certain things exist, but are also given methods for creating them with no more than a  compass and an unmarked straightedge . [ 4 ]  In this sense, Euclidean geometry is more concrete than many modern axiomatic systems such as  set theory , which often assert the existence of objects without saying how to construct them, or even assert the existence of objects that cannot be constructed within the theory. Strictly speaking, the lines on paper are  models  of the objects defined within the formal system, rather than instances of those objects. For example a Euclidean straight line has no width, but any real drawn line will. Although  nonconstructive methods  are today considered by nearly all mathematicians to be just as sound as constructive ones, Euclid's constructive proofs often supplanted fallacious nonconstructive ones, e.g., some of the Pythagoreans' proofs involving irrational numbers, which usually required a statement such as ""Find the greatest common measure of ..."" [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   The parallel postulate       Main article:  Parallel postulate              The parallel postulate: If two lines intersect a third in such a way that the sum of the inner angles on one side is less than two right angles, then the two lines inevitably must intersect each other on that side if extended far enough.       To the ancients, the parallel postulate seemed less obvious than the others. Euclid himself seems to have considered it as being qualitatively different from the others, as evidenced by the organization of the  Elements : the first 28 propositions he presents are those that can be proved without it.   Many alternative axioms can be formulated that have the same logical consequences as the parallel postulate. For example  Playfair's axiom  states:     Through a point not on a given straight line, at most one line can be drawn that never meets the given line.       [ edit ]   System of measurement and arithmetic   Euclidean geometry has two fundamental types of measurements: angle and distance. The angle scale is absolute, and Euclid uses the right angle as his basic unit, so that, e.g., a 45-degree angle would be referred to as half of a right angle. The distance scale is relative; one arbitrarily picks a line with a certain length as the unit, and other distances are expressed in relation to it.   A line in Euclidean geometry is a model of the  real number line . Addition is represented by a construction in which one line is copied onto the end of another line to extend its length, and similarly for subtraction.   Measurements of area and volume are derived from distances. For example, a rectangle with a width of 3 and a length of 4 has an area that represents the product, 12. Because this geometrical interpretation of multiplication was limited to three dimensions, there was no direct way of interpreting the product of four or more numbers, and Euclid avoided such products, although they are implied, e.g., in the proof of book IX, proposition 20.          An example of congruence. The two figures on the left are congruent, while the third is  similar  to them. The last figure is neither. Note that congruences alter some properties, such as location and orientation, but leave others unchanged, like  distance  and  angles . The latter sort of properties are called  invariants  and studying them is the essence of geometry.       Euclid refers to a pair of lines, or a pair of planar or solid figures, as ""equal"" () if their lengths, areas, or volumes are equal, and similarly for angles. The stronger term "" congruent "" refers to the idea that an entire figure is the same size and shape as another figure. Alternatively, two figures are congruent if one can be moved on top of the other so that it matches up with it exactly. (Flipping it over is allowed.) Thus, for example, a 2x6 rectangle and a 3x4 rectangle are equal but not congruent, and the letter R is congruent to its mirror image. Figures that would be congruent except for their differing sizes are referred to as  similar .     [ edit ]   Notation and terminology     [ edit ]   Naming of points and figures   Points are customarily named using capital letters of the alphabet. Other figures, such as lines, triangles, or circles, are named by listing a sufficient number of points to pick them out unambiguously from the relevant figure, e.g., triangle ABC would typically be a triangle with vertices at points A, B, and C.     [ edit ]   Complementary and supplementary angles   Angles whose sum is a right angle are called  complementary , those whose sum is two right angles  supplementary .     [ edit ]   Modern versions of Euclid's notation   In modern terminology, angles would normally be measured in  degrees  or  radians .   Modern school textbooks often define separate figures called  lines  (infinite),  rays  (semi-infinite), and  line segments  (of finite length). Euclid, rather than discussing a ray as an object that extends to infinity in one direction, would normally use locutions such as ""if the line is extended to a sufficient length,"" although he occasionally referred to ""infinite lines."" A ""line"" in Euclid could be either straight or curved, and he used the more specific term ""straight line"" when necessary.     [ edit ]   Some important or well known results                   The  bridge of asses  theorem states that A=B and C=D.                     The sum of angles A, B, and C is equal to 180 degrees.                     The Pythagorean theorem: The sum of the areas of the two squares on the legs ( a  and  b ) equals the area of the square on the hypotenuse ( c ).                     Thales' theorem: if AC is a diameter, then the angle at B is a right angle.               [ edit ]   The bridge of asses   The  bridge of asses  ( pons asinorum ) states that  In isosceles triangles the angles at the base equal one another, and, if the equal straight lines are produced further, then the angles under the base equal one another. [ 6 ]  Its name is attributed to its frequent role as the first real test in the Elements of the intelligence of the reader and as a bridge to the harder propositions that followed.          Congruence of triangles is determined by specifying two sides and the angle between them (SAS), two angles and the side between them (ASA) or two angles and a corresponding adjacent side (AAS). Specifying two sides and an adjacent angle (SSA), however, can yield two distinct possible triangles.         [ edit ]   Congruence of triangles   Triangles are congruent if they have all three sides equal (SSS), two sides and the angle between them (SAS), or two angles and a side (AAS) (Book I, propositions 4, 8, and 26). (Triangles with three equal angles are generally similar, but not necessarily congruent. Triangles with two equal sides and an adjacent angle are not necessarily equal.)     [ edit ]   Sum of the angles of a triangle   The sum of the angles of a triangle is equal to two right angles (180 degrees). [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   The Pythagorean theorem   The celebrated  Pythagorean theorem  (book I, proposition 47) states that in any right triangle, the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares whose sides are the two legs (the two sides that meet at a right angle).     [ edit ]   Thales' theorem   Thales' theorem (book I, proposition 32, named after  Thales of Miletus ) states that if A, B and C are points on a circle where the line AC is a diameter of the circle, then the angle ABC is a right angle. Tradition has it that Thales sacrificed an ox to celebrate this theorem. [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Infinitude of prime numbers   ""Prime numbers are more than any any assigned multitude of prime numbers,"" [ 9 ]  i.e., there are infinitely many prime numbers (book IX, proposition 20).     [ edit ]   Summation of geometrical series   For  , the sum of the partial  geometric series  is [ 10 ]           [ edit ]   Scaling of area and volume   In modern terminology, the area of a plane figure is proportional to the square of any of its linear dimensions,  , and the volume of a solid to the cube,  . Euclid proved these results in various special cases, e.g., for the area of a circle, [ 11 ]  and the volume of a parallelepipedal solid [ 12 ] . Euclid determined some, but not all, of the relevant constants of proportionality. E.g., it was his successor  Archimedes  who proved that a sphere has 2/3 the volume of the circumscribing cylinder. [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   Applications   Because of Euclidean geometry's fundamental status in mathematics, it would be impossible to give more than a representative sampling of applications here.                   A surveyor uses a  theodolite                     Sphere packing  applies to a stack of  oranges .                     A parabolic mirror brings parallel rays of light to a focus.             One of the earliest reasons for interest in geometry was  surveying , [ 14 ]  and certain practical results from Euclidean geometry, such as the right-angle property of the 3-4-5 triangle, were probably used long before they were proved formally. The fundamental types of measurements in Euclidean geometry are distances and angles, and both of these quantities can be measured directly by a surveyor. Historically, distances were often measured by chains such as  Gunter's chain , and angles using graduated circles and, later, the  theodolite .   An application of Euclidean solid geometry is the determination of packing arrangements, such as the problem of finding the most efficient  packing of spheres  in n dimensions. This problem has applications in  error detection and correction .   Geometric optics  uses Euclidean geometry to analyze the focusing of light by lenses and mirrors.                   Geometry is used in art and architecture.                     The water tower consists of a cone, a cylinder, and a hemisphere. Its volume can be calculated using solid geometry.                     Geometry can be used to design  origami .             Geometry is used extensively in architecture.   Geometry can be used to design  origami . Some  classical construction problems of geometry  are impossible using  compass and straightedge , but can be solved using origami. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Later work     [ edit ]   The 17th century: Descartes   Ren Descartes (1596-1650) developed  analytic geometry , an alternative method for formalizing geometry. [ 16 ]  In this approach, a point is represented by its  Cartesian  (x,y) coordinates, a line is represented by its equation, and so on. In Euclid's original approach, the  Pythagorean theorem  follows from Euclid's axioms. In the Cartesian approach, the axioms are the axioms of algebra, and the equation expressing the Pythagorean theorem is then a definition of one of the terms in Euclid's axioms, which are now considered to be theorems. The equation: defining the distance between two points  P  = ( p , q )  and  Q  = ( r , s )  is then known as the  Euclidean  metric , and other metrics define  non-Euclidean geometries .          Squaring the circle: the areas of this square and this circle are equal. In 1882, it was proven that this figure cannot be constructed in a finite number of steps with an idealized  compass and straightedge .       In terms of analytic geometry, the restriction of classical geometry to compass and straightedge constructions means a restriction to first- and second-order equations, e.g., y=2x+1 (a line), or x 2 +y 2 =7 (a circle).     [ edit ]   The 18th century   Geometers of the 18th century struggled to define the boundaries of the Euclidean system. Many tried in vain to prove the fifth postulate from the first four. By 1763 at least 28 different proofs had been published, but all were found to be incorrect. [ 17 ]   Leading up to this period, geometers also tried to determine what constructions could be accomplished in Euclidean geometry. For example, the problem of  trisecting an angle  with a compass and straightedge is one that naturally occurs within the theory, since the axioms refer to constructive operations that can be carried out with those tools. However, centuries of efforts failed to find a solution to this problem, until  Pierre Wantzel  published a proof in 1837 that such a construction was impossible. Other constructions proved to be impossible include  doubling the cube  and  squaring the circle . In the case of doubling the cube, the impossibility of the construction originates from the fact that the compass and straightedge method involve first- and second-order equations, while doubling a cube requires the solution of a third-order equation.   Euler  discussed a generalization of Euclidean geometry called  affine geometry , which retains the fifth postulate unmodified while weakening postulates three and four in a way that eliminates the notions of angle (whence right triangles become meaningless) and of equality of length of line segments in general (whence circles become meaningless) while retaining the notions of parallelism as an equivalence relation between lines, and equality of length of parallel line segments (so line segments continue to have a midpoint).     [ edit ]   The 19th century and noneuclidean geometry   Around 1830, the  Jnos Bolyai  and  Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky  separately published work on  noneuclidean geometry , in which the parallel postulate is not valid. [ 18 ]  Since noneuclidean geometry is provably self-consistent, the parallel postulate cannot be proved from the other postulates.   In the 19th century, it was also realized that Euclid's ten axioms and common notions do not suffice to prove all of theorems stated in the  Elements . For example, Euclid assumed implicitly that any line contains at least two points, but this assumption cannot be proved from the other axioms, and therefore needs to be an axiom itself. The very first geometric proof in the  Elements,  shown in the figure above, is that any line segment is part of a triangle; Euclid constructs this in the usual way, by drawing circles around both endpoints and taking their intersection as the third  vertex . His axioms, however, do not guarantee that the circles actually intersect, because they are consistent with discrete, rather than continuous, space. Starting with  Moritz Pasch  in 1882, many improved axiomatic systems for geometry have been proposed, the best known being those of  Hilbert , [ 19 ]   George Birkhoff , [ 20 ]  and  Tarski . [ 21 ]     [ edit ]   The 20th century and general relativity          A disproof of Euclidean geometry as a description of physical space. In a 1919 test of the general theory of relativity, stars (marked with short horizontal lines) were photographed during a solar  eclipse . The rays of starlight were bent by the Sun's gravity on their way to the earth. This is interpreted as evidence in favor of Einstein's prediction that gravity would cause deviations from Euclidean geometry.       Euclid believed that his axioms were self-evident statements about physical reality. Taken as a physical description of space, postulate 2 (extending a line) asserts that space does not have holes or boundaries (i.e., space is homogenous); postulate 3 (constructing a circle) asserts that space is infinite, [ 22 ]  since there is no limit on the radius of the circle; 4 (equality of right angles) says that space is homogeneous and isotropic, so that figures may be moved to any location while maintaining congruence; and 5 that space is flat. [ 23 ]   However,  Einstein's  theory of  general relativity  shows that the true geometry of spacetime is  non-Euclidean geometry . [ 24 ]  For example, if a triangle is constructed out of three rays of light, then in general the interior angles do not add up to 180 degrees due to gravity. A relatively weak gravitational field, such as the Earth's or the sun's, is represented by a metric that is approximately, but not exactly, Euclidean. Until the 20th century, there was no technology capable of detecting the deviations from Euclidean geometry, but Einstein predicted that such deviations would exist. They were later verified by observations such as the observation of the slight bending of starlight by the Sun during a solar eclipse in 1919, and  non-Euclidean geometry  is now, for example, an integral part of the software that runs the  GPS  system. [ 25 ]  It is possible to object to the non-Euclidean interpretation of general relativity on the grounds that light rays might be improper physical models of Euclid's lines, or that relativity could be rephrased so as to avoid the geometrical interpretations. However, one of the consequences of Einstein's theory is that there is no possible physical test that can do any better than a beam of light as a model of geometry. Thus, the only logical possibilities are to accept  non-Euclidean geometry  as physically real, or to reject the entire notion of physical tests of the axioms of geometry, which can then be imagined as a formal system without any intrinsic real-world meaning.     [ edit ]   Treatment of infinity     [ edit ]   Infinite objects   Euclid sometimes distinguished explicitly between ""finite lines"" (e.g., Postulate 2) and "" infinite  lines."" (book I, proposition 12) However, he typically did not make such distinctions unless they were necessary, and postulates 1, 3, and 4 are consistent with  elliptic geometry , in which there is a finite limit on the length of any line.   The notion of  infinitesimally small quantities  had previously been discussed extensively by the  Eleatic School , but nobody had been able to put them on a firm logical basis, with paradoxes such as  Zeno's paradox  occurring that had not been resolved to universal satisfaction. Euclid used the  method of exhaustion  rather than infinitesimals. [ 26 ]   Later ancient commentators such as  Proclus  (410-485 CE) treated many questions about infinity as issues demanding proof and, e.g., Proclus claimed to prove the infinite divisibility of a line, based on a proof by contradiction in which he considered the cases of even and odd numbers of points constituting it. [ 27 ]   At the turn of the 20th century,  Giuseppe Veronese  produced controversial work on  non-Archimedean  models of Euclidean geometry, in which the distance between two points may be infinite or infinitesimal, in the  Newton - Leibniz  sense. [ 28 ]  Fifty years later,  Abraham Robinson  provided a rigorous logical foundation for Veronese's work. [ 29 ]     [ edit ]   Infinite processes   One reason that the ancients treated the parallel postulate as less certain than the others is that verifying it physically would require us to inspect two lines to check that they never intersected, even at some very distant point, and this inspection could potentially take an infinite amount of time. [ 30 ]   The modern formulation of  proof by induction  was not developed until the 17th century, but later commentators consider it to be implicit in some of Euclid's proofs, e.g., the proof of the infinitude of primes. [ 31 ]     [ edit ]   Logical basis   Euclid frequently used the method of  proof by contradiction , and therefore the traditional presentation of Euclidean geometry assumes  classical logic , in which every proposition is either true or false, i.e., for any proposition P, the proposition ""P or not P"" is automatically true.   Tarski  (1902-1983) and his students demonstrated for the first time that Euclidean geometry can be expressed as a  first-order theory . That is, it can be written entirely in a form that allows statements such as ""for all triangles ..."", without those like ""for all  sets  of triangles ..."" This is important because it shows that the subject does not depend on  set theory  for its logical basis. Tarski proved his  axiomatic formulation  of Euclidean geometry to be complete in a certain  sense : there is an algorithm which, for every proposition, can show it to be either true or false.

clueweb09-enwp00-74-10408	"                     Euclid's theorem          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search          Euclid's theorem  is a fundamental statement in  number theory  which asserts that there are  infinitely  many  prime numbers . There are several well-known proofs of the theorem.           Contents       1   Euclid's proof   2   Euler's proof   3   See also   4   External links               [ edit ]   Euclid's proof   Euclid offered the following proof published in his work  Elements  (Book IX, Proposition 20) and paraphrased here.   Take any finite list of prime numbers  p 1 ,  p 2 , ...,  p n . It will be shown that some additional prime numbers not in this list exist, as follows:   Let  P  be the product of all the prime numbers:  P  =  p 1 ... p n . Let  q  =  P  + 1: more than this product. Then,  q  is either prime or not.   If  q  is prime then the list is not exhaustive:  q  is not on it.   If  q  is not prime then some prime factor  p  divides  q . This factor  p  is not on our list: if it were, then it would divide  P  (since  P  is the product of every number on the list); but as we know,  p  divides  P  + 1 =  q . Then  p  would have to divide the difference of the two numbers, which is ( P  + 1)   P  or just 1. But no prime number divides 1 so there would be a contradiction, and therefore  p  cannot be on the list. This means at least one more prime number exists beyond those in the list.   This proves that for  any  finite list of prime numbers, there is a prime number not on the list. Therefore there must be infinitely many prime numbers.     [ edit ]   Euler's proof   Another proof, by the Swiss mathematician  Leonhard Euler , relies on the  fundamental theorem of arithmetic : that every number has a unique prime factorization. If  P  is the set of all prime numbers, Euler wrote that:         The first equality is given by the formula for a  geometric series  in each term of the product. To show the second equality, distribute the product over the sum: in the result, every product of primes appears exactly once, so by the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, the sum is equal to the sum over all integers.   The sum on the right is the  harmonic series , which diverges. So the product on the left must diverge also. Since each term of the product is finite, the number of terms must be infinite, so there is an infinite number of primes.

clueweb09-enwp00-86-00585	"                     Euclidean geometry          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Geometry in R2 )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search                 A representation of  Euclid  from  The School of Athens  by  Raphael .       Euclidean geometry  is a mathematical system attributed to the  Greek mathematician   Euclid  of  Alexandria .  Euclid's  Elements  is the earliest known systematic discussion of  geometry . It has been one of the most influential books in history, as much for its method as for its mathematical content. The method consists of assuming a small set of intuitively appealing  axioms , and then proving many other  propositions  ( theorems ) from those axioms. Although many of Euclid's results had been stated by earlier Greek mathematicians, Euclid was the first to show how these propositions could be fit together into a comprehensive deductive and  logical system .The  Elements  begin with  plane geometry , still taught in  secondary school  as the first  axiomatic system  and the first examples of  formal proof . It goes on to the  solid geometry  of three  dimensions . Much of the  Elements  states results of what is now called  number theory , proved using geometrical methods.   For over two thousand years, the adjective ""Euclidean"" was unnecessary because no other sort of geometry had been conceived. Euclid's axioms seemed so intuitively obvious that any theorem proved from them was deemed true in an absolute sense. Today, however, many other  self-consistent   non-Euclidean geometries  are known, the first ones having been discovered in the early 19th century. It also is no longer taken for granted that Euclidean geometry describes physical space. An implication of  Einstein 's theory of  general relativity  is that Euclidean geometry is a good approximation to the properties of physical space only if the  gravitational field  is not too strong.

Its superiority over earlier treatments was rapidly recognized, with the result that there was little interest in preserving the earlier ones, and they are now nearly all lost.   Books I-IV discuss plane geometry. Many results about plane figures are proved, e.g.,  If a triangle has two equal angles, then the sides subtended by the angles are equal.  The  Pythagorean theorem  is proved. [ 2 ]   Books V-X deal with number theory, with numbers treated geometrically via their representation as line segments with various lengths. Notions such as  prime numbers  and  rational  and  irrational  numbers are introduced. The infinitude of prime numbers is proved.   Books XI-XIII concern solid geometry. A typical result is the 1:3 ratio between the volume of a cone and a cylinder with the same height and base.     [ edit ]   Axiomatic treatment          A proof from Euclid's elements that, given a line segment, an equilateral triangle exists that includes the segment as one of its sides. The proof is by construction: an equilateral triangle  is made by drawing circles  and  centered on the points  and , and taking one intersection of the circles as the third vertex of the triangle.       Euclidean geometry is an  axiomatic system , in which all  theorems  (""true statements"") are derived from a small number of axioms. Near the beginning of the first book of the  Elements , Euclid gives five  postulates  (axioms) for plane geometry: [ 3 ]     Let the following be postulated: to draw a  straight line  from any  point  to any point.   To produce [extend] a  finite straight line  continuously in a straight line.   To describe a  circle  with any center and distance [radius].   That all right angles are equal to one another.   The  parallel postulate : That, if a straight line falling on two straight lines make the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which are the angles less than the two right angles.     The  Elements  also include the following five ""common notions"":     Things that equal the same thing also equal one another.   If equals are added to equals, then the wholes are equal.   If equals are subtracted from equals, then the remainders are equal.   Things that coincide with one another equal one another.   The whole is greater than the part.       [ edit ]   Constructive approach   Euclidean geometry is  constructive . Postulates 1, 2, 3, and 5 assert the existence and uniqueness of certain geometric figures, and these assertions are of a constructive nature: that is, we are not only told that certain things exist, but are also given methods for creating them with no more than a  compass and an unmarked straightedge . [ 4 ]  In this sense, Euclidean geometry is more concrete than many modern axiomatic systems such as  set theory , which often assert the existence of objects without saying how to construct them, or even assert the existence of objects that cannot be constructed within the theory. Strictly speaking, the lines on paper are  models  of the objects defined within the formal system, rather than instances of those objects. For example a Euclidean straight line has no width, but any real drawn line will. Although  nonconstructive methods  are today considered by nearly all mathematicians to be just as sound as constructive ones, Euclid's constructive proofs often supplanted fallacious nonconstructive ones, e.g., some of the Pythagoreans' proofs involving irrational numbers, which usually required a statement such as ""Find the greatest common measure of ..."" [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   The parallel postulate   Main article:  Parallel postulate          The parallel postulate: If two lines intersect a third in such a way that the sum of the inner angles on one side is less than two right angles, then the two lines inevitably must intersect each other on that side if extended far enough.       To the ancients, the parallel postulate seemed less obvious than the others. Euclid himself seems to have considered it as being qualitatively different from the others, as evidenced by the organization of the  Elements : the first 28 propositions he presents are those that can be proved without it.   Many alternative axioms can be formulated that have the same logical consequences as the parallel postulate. For example  Playfair's axiom  states:     Through a point not on a given straight line, at most one line can be drawn that never meets the given line.       [ edit ]   System of measurement and arithmetic   Euclidean geometry has two fundamental types of measurements: angle and distance. The angle scale is absolute, and Euclid uses the right angle as his basic unit, so that, e.g., a 45-degree angle would be referred to as half of a right angle. The distance scale is relative; one arbitrarily picks a line with a certain length as the unit, and other distances are expressed in relation to it.   A line in Euclidean geometry is a model of the  real number line . Addition is represented by a construction in which one line is copied onto the end of another line to extend its length, and similarly for subtraction.   Measurements of area and volume are derived from distances. For example, a rectangle with a width of 3 and a length of 4 has an area that represents the product, 12. Because this geometrical interpretation of multiplication was limited to three dimensions, there was no direct way of interpreting the product of four or more numbers, and Euclid avoided such products, although they are implied, e.g., in the proof of book IX, proposition 20.          An example of congruence. The two figures on the left are congruent, while the third is  similar  to them. The last figure is neither. Note that congruences alter some properties, such as location and orientation, but leave others unchanged, like  distance  and  angles . The latter sort of properties are called  invariants  and studying them is the essence of geometry.       Euclid refers to a pair of lines, or a pair of planar or solid figures, as ""equal"" () if their lengths, areas, or volumes are equal, and similarly for angles. The stronger term "" congruent "" refers to the idea that an entire figure is the same size and shape as another figure. Alternatively, two figures are congruent if one can be moved on top of the other so that it matches up with it exactly. (Flipping it over is allowed.) Thus, for example, a 2x6 rectangle and a 3x4 rectangle are equal but not congruent, and the letter R is congruent to its mirror image. Figures that would be congruent except for their differing sizes are referred to as  similar .     [ edit ]   Notation and terminology     [ edit ]   Naming of points and figures   Points are customarily named using capital letters of the alphabet. Other figures, such as lines, triangles, or circles, are named by listing a sufficient number of points to pick them out unambiguously from the relevant figure, e.g., triangle ABC would typically be a triangle with vertices at points A, B, and C.     [ edit ]   Complementary and supplementary angles   Angles whose sum is a right angle are called  complementary , those whose sum is two right angles  supplementary .     [ edit ]   Modern versions of Euclid's notation   In modern terminology, angles would normally be measured in  degrees  or  radians .   Modern school textbooks often define separate figures called  lines  (infinite),  rays  (semi-infinite), and  line segments  (of finite length). Euclid, rather than discussing a ray as an object that extends to infinity in one direction, would normally use locutions such as ""if the line is extended to a sufficient length,"" although he occasionally referred to ""infinite lines."" A ""line"" in Euclid could be either straight or curved, and he used the more specific term ""straight line"" when necessary.     [ edit ]   Some important or well known results                   The  bridge of asses  theorem states that A=B and C=D.                     The sum of angles A, B, and C is equal to 180 degrees.                     The Pythagorean theorem: The sum of the areas of the two squares on the legs ( a  and  b ) equals the area of the square on the hypotenuse ( c ).                     Thales' theorem: if AC is a diameter, then the angle at B is a right angle.               [ edit ]   The bridge of asses   The  bridge of asses  ( pons asinorum ) states that  In isosceles triangles the angles at the base equal one another, and, if the equal straight lines are produced further, then the angles under the base equal one another. [ 6 ]  Its name is attributed to its frequent role as the first real test in the Elements of the intelligence of the reader and as a bridge to the harder propositions that followed.          Congruence of triangles is determined by specifying two sides and the angle between them (SAS), two angles and the side between them (ASA) or two angles and a corresponding adjacent side (AAS). Specifying two sides and an adjacent angle (SSA), however, can yield two distinct possible triangles.         [ edit ]   Congruence of triangles   Triangles are congruent if they have all three sides equal (SSS), two sides and the angle between them (SAS), or two angles and a side (AAS) (Book I, propositions 4, 8, and 26). (Triangles with three equal angles are generally similar, but not necessarily congruent. Triangles with two equal sides and an adjacent angle are not necessarily equal.)     [ edit ]   Sum of the angles of a triangle   The sum of the angles of a triangle is equal to two right angles (180 degrees). [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   The Pythagorean theorem   The celebrated  Pythagorean theorem  (book I, proposition 47) states that in any right triangle, the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares whose sides are the two legs (the two sides that meet at a right angle).     [ edit ]   Thales' theorem   Thales' theorem (book I, proposition 32, named after  Thales of Miletus ) states that if A, B and C are points on a circle where the line AC is a diameter of the circle, then the angle ABC is a right angle. Tradition has it that Thales sacrificed an ox to celebrate this theorem. [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Infinitude of prime numbers   ""Prime numbers are more than any any assigned multitude of prime numbers,"" [ 9 ]  i.e., there are infinitely many prime numbers (book IX, proposition 20).     [ edit ]   Summation of geometrical series   For  , the sum of the partial  geometric series  is [ 10 ]           [ edit ]   Scaling of area and volume   In modern terminology, the area of a plane figure is proportional to the square of any of its linear dimensions,  , and the volume of a solid to the cube,  . Euclid proved these results in various special cases, e.g., for the area of a circle, [ 11 ]  and the volume of a parallelepipedal solid [ 12 ] . Euclid determined some, but not all, of the relevant constants of proportionality. E.g., it was his successor  Archimedes  who proved that a sphere has 2/3 the volume of the circumscribing cylinder.

Because of Euclidean geometry's fundamental status in mathematics, it would be impossible to give more than a representative sampling of applications here.                   A surveyor uses a  theodolite                     Sphere packing  applies to a stack of  oranges .                     A parabolic mirror brings parallel rays of light to a focus.             One of the earliest reasons for interest in geometry was  surveying , [ 14 ]  and certain practical results from Euclidean geometry, such as the right-angle property of the 3-4-5 triangle, were probably used long before they were proved formally. The fundamental types of measurements in Euclidean geometry are distances and angles, and both of these quantities can be measured directly by a surveyor. Historically, distances were often measured by chains such as  Gunter's chain , and angles using graduated circles and, later, the  theodolite .   An application of Euclidean solid geometry is the determination of packing arrangements, such as the problem of finding the most efficient  packing of spheres  in n dimensions. This problem has applications in  error detection and correction .   Geometric optics  uses Euclidean geometry to analyze the focusing of light by lenses and mirrors.                   Geometry is used in art and architecture.                     The water tower consists of a cone, a cylinder, and a hemisphere. Its volume can be calculated using solid geometry.                     Geometry can be used to design  origami .             Geometry is used extensively in architecture.   Geometry can be used to design  origami . Some  classical construction problems of geometry  are impossible using  compass and straightedge , but can be solved using origami. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Later work     [ edit ]   The 17th century: Descartes   Ren Descartes (1596-1650) developed  analytic geometry , an alternative method for formalizing geometry. [ 16 ]  In this approach, a point is represented by its  Cartesian  (x,y) coordinates, a line is represented by its equation, and so on. In Euclid's original approach, the  Pythagorean theorem  follows from Euclid's axioms. In the Cartesian approach, the axioms are the axioms of algebra, and the equation expressing the Pythagorean theorem is then a definition of one of the terms in Euclid's axioms, which are now considered to be theorems. The equation: defining the distance between two points  P  = ( p , q )  and  Q  = ( r , s )  is then known as the  Euclidean  metric , and other metrics define  non-Euclidean geometries .          Squaring the circle: the areas of this square and this circle are equal. In 1882, it was proven that this figure cannot be constructed in a finite number of steps with an idealized  compass and straightedge .       In terms of analytic geometry, the restriction of classical geometry to compass and straightedge constructions means a restriction to first- and second-order equations, e.g., y=2x+1 (a line), or x 2 +y 2 =7 (a circle).     [ edit ]   The 18th century   Geometers of the 18th century struggled to define the boundaries of the Euclidean system. Many tried in vain to prove the fifth postulate from the first four. By 1763 at least 28 different proofs had been published, but all were found to be incorrect. [ 17 ]   Leading up to this period, geometers also tried to determine what constructions could be accomplished in Euclidean geometry. For example, the problem of  trisecting an angle  with a compass and straightedge is one that naturally occurs within the theory, since the axioms refer to constructive operations that can be carried out with those tools. However, centuries of efforts failed to find a solution to this problem, until  Pierre Wantzel  published a proof in 1837 that such a construction was impossible. Other constructions proved to be impossible include  doubling the cube  and  squaring the circle . In the case of doubling the cube, the impossibility of the construction originates from the fact that the compass and straightedge method involve first- and second-order equations, while doubling a cube requires the solution of a third-order equation.   Euler  discussed a generalization of Euclidean geometry called  affine geometry , which retains the fifth postulate unmodified while weakening postulates three and four in a way that eliminates the notions of angle (whence right triangles become meaningless) and of equality of length of line segments in general (whence circles become meaningless) while retaining the notions of parallelism as an equivalence relation between lines, and equality of length of parallel line segments (so line segments continue to have a midpoint).     [ edit ]   The 19th century and noneuclidean geometry   Around 1830, the  Jnos Bolyai  and  Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky  separately published work on  noneuclidean geometry , in which the parallel postulate is not valid. [ 18 ]  Since noneuclidean geometry is provably self-consistent, the parallel postulate cannot be proved from the other postulates.   In the 19th century, it was also realized that Euclid's ten axioms and common notions do not suffice to prove all of theorems stated in the  Elements . For example, Euclid assumed implicitly that any line contains at least two points, but this assumption cannot be proved from the other axioms, and therefore needs to be an axiom itself. The very first geometric proof in the  Elements,  shown in the figure above, is that any line segment is part of a triangle; Euclid constructs this in the usual way, by drawing circles around both endpoints and taking their intersection as the third  vertex . His axioms, however, do not guarantee that the circles actually intersect, because they are consistent with discrete, rather than continuous, space. Starting with  Moritz Pasch  in 1882, many improved axiomatic systems for geometry have been proposed, the best known being those of  Hilbert , [ 19 ]   George Birkhoff , [ 20 ]  and  Tarski . [ 21 ]     [ edit ]   The 20th century and general relativity          A disproof of Euclidean geometry as a description of physical space. In a 1919 test of the general theory of relativity, stars (marked with short horizontal lines) were photographed during a solar  eclipse . The rays of starlight were bent by the Sun's gravity on their way to the earth. This is interpreted as evidence in favor of Einstein's prediction that gravity would cause deviations from Euclidean geometry.       Euclid believed that his axioms were self-evident statements about physical reality. Taken as a physical description of space, postulate 2 (extending a line) asserts that space does not have holes or boundaries (i.e., space is homogenous); postulate 3 (constructing a circle) asserts that space is infinite, [ 22 ]  since there is no limit on the radius of the circle; 4 (equality of right angles) says that space is homogeneous and isotropic, so that figures may be moved to any location while maintaining congruence; and 5 that space is flat. [ 23 ]   However,  Einstein's  theory of  general relativity  shows that the true geometry of spacetime is  non-Euclidean geometry . [ 24 ]  For example, if a triangle is constructed out of three rays of light, then in general the interior angles do not add up to 180 degrees due to gravity. A relatively weak gravitational field, such as the Earth's or the sun's, is represented by a metric that is approximately, but not exactly, Euclidean. Until the 20th century, there was no technology capable of detecting the deviations from Euclidean geometry, but Einstein predicted that such deviations would exist. They were later verified by observations such as the observation of the slight bending of starlight by the Sun during a solar eclipse in 1919, and  non-Euclidean geometry  is now, for example, an integral part of the software that runs the  GPS  system. [ 25 ]  It is possible to object to the non-Euclidean interpretation of general relativity on the grounds that light rays might be improper physical models of Euclid's lines, or that relativity could be rephrased so as to avoid the geometrical interpretations. However, one of the consequences of Einstein's theory is that there is no possible physical test that can do any better than a beam of light as a model of geometry. Thus, the only logical possibilities are to accept  non-Euclidean geometry  as physically real, or to reject the entire notion of physical tests of the axioms of geometry, which can then be imagined as a formal system without any intrinsic real-world meaning.     [ edit ]   Treatment of infinity     [ edit ]   Infinite objects   Euclid sometimes distinguished explicitly between ""finite lines"" (e.g., Postulate 2) and "" infinite  lines"" (book I, proposition 12). However, he typically did not make such distinctions unless they were necessary. The postulates do not explicitly refer to infinite lines, although for example some commentators interpret postulate 3, existence of a circle with any radius, as implying that space is infinite. [ 26 ]   The notion of  infinitesimally small quantities  had previously been discussed extensively by the  Eleatic School , but nobody had been able to put them on a firm logical basis, with paradoxes such as  Zeno's paradox  occurring that had not been resolved to universal satisfaction. Euclid used the  method of exhaustion  rather than infinitesimals. [ 27 ]   Later ancient commentators such as  Proclus  (410-485 CE) treated many questions about infinity as issues demanding proof and, e.g., Proclus claimed to prove the infinite divisibility of a line, based on a proof by contradiction in which he considered the cases of even and odd numbers of points constituting it. [ 28 ]   At the turn of the 20th century,  Giuseppe Veronese  produced controversial work on  non-Archimedean  models of Euclidean geometry, in which the distance between two points may be infinite or infinitesimal, in the  Newton - Leibniz  sense. [ 29 ]  Fifty years later,  Abraham Robinson  provided a rigorous logical foundation for Veronese's work. [ 30 ]     [ edit ]   Infinite processes   One reason that the ancients treated the parallel postulate as less certain than the others is that verifying it physically would require us to inspect two lines to check that they never intersected, even at some very distant point, and this inspection could potentially take an infinite amount of time. [ 31 ]   The modern formulation of  proof by induction  was not developed until the 17th century, but later commentators consider it to be implicit in some of Euclid's proofs, e.g., the proof of the infinitude of primes. [ 32 ]     [ edit ]   Logical basis   Euclid frequently used the method of  proof by contradiction , and therefore the traditional presentation of Euclidean geometry assumes  classical logic , in which every proposition is either true or false, i.e., for any proposition P, the proposition ""P or not P"" is automatically true.   Tarski  (1902-1983) and his students demonstrated for the first time that Euclidean geometry can be expressed as a  first-order theory . That is, it can be written entirely in a form that allows statements such as ""for all triangles ..."", without those like ""for all  sets  of triangles ..."" This is important because it shows that the subject does not depend on  set theory  for its logical basis. Tarski proved his  axiomatic formulation  of Euclidean geometry to be complete in a certain  sense : there is an algorithm which, for every proposition, can show it to be either true or false.

clueweb09-enwp00-71-10547	"                     Euclid's Elements          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search                 The  frontispiece  of Sir Henry Billingsley's first English version of Euclid's  Elements , 1570       Euclid's  Elements  ( Greek :   ) is a  mathematical  and  geometric   treatise  consisting of 13 books written by the  Greek mathematician   Euclid  in  Alexandria   circa  300 BC. It comprises a collection of definitions, postulates ( axioms ), propositions ( theorems  and  constructions ), and  mathematical proofs  of the propositions. The thirteen books cover  Euclidean geometry  and the ancient Greek version of elementary  number theory . With the exception of  Autolycus'   On the Moving Sphere , the  Elements  is one of the oldest extant Greek mathematical treatises [ 1 ]  and it is the oldest extant axiomatic deductive treatment of  mathematics . [ 2 ]  It has proven instrumental in the development of  logic  and modern  science .   Euclid's  Elements  is the most successful [ 3 ] [ 4 ]  and influential [ 5 ]  textbook ever written. Being first set in type in  Venice  in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the  printing press  and is estimated to be second only to the  Bible  in the number of editions published, [ 5 ]  with the number reaching well over one thousand. [ 6 ]  It was used as the basic text on geometry throughout the Western world for about 2,000 years. For centuries, when the  quadrivium  was included in the curriculum of all university students, knowledge of at least part of Euclid's  Elements  was required of all students. Not until the 20th century, by which time its content was universally taught through school books, did it cease to be considered something all educated people had read.

[ 7 ]       Euclid  was a  Greek  mathematician who wrote  Elements  in Alexandria during the  Hellenistic period  (around 300 BC). Scholars believe that the  Elements  is largely a collection of theorems proved by other mathematicians supplemented by some original work.  Proclus , a Greek mathematician who lived several centuries after Euclid, wrote in his commentary of the  Elements : ""Euclid, who put together the Elements, collecting many of  Eudoxus ' theorems, perfecting many of  Theaetetus ', and also bringing to irrefragable demonstration the things which were only somewhat loosely proved by his predecessors"".   In the fourth century C.E.  Theon of Alexandria  produced an edition of Euclid which was so widely used that it became the only surviving source until  Franois Peyrard 's 1808 discovery at the  Vatican  of a manuscript not derived from Theon's.   Although known to, for instance,  Cicero , there is no extant record of the text having been translated into Latin prior to  Boethius  in the fifth or sixth century. [ 7 ]  The Arabs received the  Elements  from the Byzantines in approximately 760; this version, by a pupil of Euclid called  Proclo , was translated into  Arabic  under  Harun al Rashid  circa 800 AD. [ 7 ]  The first printed edition appeared in 1482 (based on  Giovanni Campano's  1260 edition), and since then it has been translated into many languages and published in about a thousand different editions. In 1570,  John Dee  provided a widely respected ""Mathematical Preface"", along with copious notes and supplementary material, to the first English edition by  Henry Billingsley .   Copies of the Greek text still exist, some of which can be found in the  Vatican Library  and the  Bodleian Library  in Oxford. The manuscripts available are of variable quality, and invariably incomplete. By careful analysis of the translations and originals, hypotheses have been drawn about the contents of the original text (copies of which are no longer available).   Ancient texts which refer to the  Elements  itself and to other mathematical theories that were current at the time it was written are also important in this process. Such analyses are conducted by  J. L. Heiberg  and Sir  Thomas Little Heath  in their editions of the text.   Also of importance are the  scholia , or annotations to the text. These additions, which often distinguished themselves from the main text (depending on the manuscript), gradually accumulated over time as opinions varied upon what was worthy of explanation or elucidation.     [ edit ]   A difficult text   Although we now consider the  Elements  to be an elementary text on geometry, that was not always the case. It is said that King  Ptolemy  asked for a way in geometry that was shorter than the Elements. Euclid answered that ""there is no  royal road  to geometry.""  [ 8 ]  More recently, Sir  Thomas Little Heath  wrote, in his introduction to the 1932 Everyman's Library volume of  Euclid :     The simple truth is that it was not written for schoolboys or schoolgirls, but for the grown man who would have the necessary knowledge and judgment to appreciate the highly contentious matters which have to be grappled with in any attempt to set out the essentials of Euclidean geometry as a strictly  logical system ..."". [ 9 ]     The first difficult passage of Book I is referred to as the  pons asinorum , which is Latin for ""Bridge of Asses"" (traditionally, it is hard to get  asses  to cross a bridge). [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   Influence   The  Elements  is still considered a masterpiece in the application of  logic  to  mathematics . In historical context, it has proven enormously influential in many areas of  science . Scientists  Nicolaus Copernicus ,  Johannes Kepler ,  Galileo Galilei , and Sir  Isaac Newton  were all influenced by the  Elements , and applied their knowledge of it to their work. Mathematicians and philosophers, such as  Bertrand Russell ,  Alfred North Whitehead , and  Baruch Spinoza , have attempted to create their own foundational ""Elements"" for their respective disciplines, by adopting the axiomatized deductive structures that Euclid's work introduced.   The austere beauty of Euclidean geometry has been seen by many in western culture as a glimpse of an otherworldly system of perfection and certainty. Abraham Lincoln kept a copy of Euclid in his saddlebag, and studied it late at night by lamplight; he related that he said to himself,  you never can make a lawyer if you do not understand what demonstrate means; and I left my situation in Springfield, went home to my father's house, and stayed there till I could give any proposition in the six books of Euclid at sight . [ 11 ]   Edna St. Vincent Millay  wrote in her sonnet ""Euclid Alone Has Looked on Beauty Bare:""  O blinding hour, O holy, terrible day, When first the shaft into his vision shone Of light anatomized!   Einstein  recalled a copy of the  Elements  and a magnetic compass as two gifts that had a great influence on him as a boy, referring to the Euclid as the ""holy little geometry book"". [ 12 ]   The success of the  Elements  is due primarily to its logical presentation of most of the mathematical knowledge available to Euclid. Much of the material is not original to him, although many of the proofs are his. However, Euclid's systematic development of his subject, from a small set of axioms to deep results, and the consistency of his approach throughout the  Elements , encouraged its use as a textbook for about 2,000 years. The  Elements  still influences modern geometry books. Further, its logical axiomatic approach and rigorous proofs remain the cornerstone of mathematics.     [ edit ]   Outline of  Elements       Main article:  Euclidean geometry              A proof from Euclid's  Elements  that, given a line segment, an equilateral triangle exists that includes the segment as one of its sides. The proof is by construction: an equilateral triangle  is made by drawing circles  and  centered on the points  and , and taking one intersection of the circles as the third vertex of the triangle.         [ edit ]   Contents of the books          A fragment of Euclid's elements found at  Oxyrhynchus , which is dated to circa 100 AD. The diagram accompanies Proposition 5 of Book II of the  Elements .       Books 1 through 4 deal with plane geometry:     Book 1 contains Euclid's 5 axioms (including the  parallel postulate ) and the basic propositions of geometry: the  pons asinorum  (proposition 5) , the  Pythagorean theorem  (Proposition 47), equality of angles and  areas , parallelism, the sum of the angles in a triangle, and the three cases in which triangles are ""equal"" (have the same area).   Book 2 is commonly called the ""book of geometrical algebra,"" because the material it contains may easily be interpreted in terms of  algebra .   Book 3 deals with circles and their properties:  inscribed  angles,  tangents , the power of a point.   Book 4 constructs the  incircle  and  circumcircle  of a triangle, and constructs  regular polygons  with 4, 5, 6, and 15 sides.     Books 5 through 10 introduce  ratios  and  proportions :     Book 5 is a treatise on proportions of  magnitudes . Proposition 25 has as a special case the  inequality of arithmetic and geometric means .   Book 6 applies proportions to geometry:  Thales' theorem , similar figures.   Book 7 deals strictly with elementary number theory:  divisibility ,  prime numbers ,  Euclid's algorithm  for finding the  greatest common divisor ,  least common multiple . Propositions 30 and 32 together are essentially equivalent to the  fundamental theorem of arithmetic  stating that every positive integer can be written as a product of primes in an essentially unique way, though Euclid would have had trouble stating it in this modern form as he did not use the product of more than 3 numbers.   Book 8 deals with proportions in number theory and  geometric sequences .   Book 9 applies the results of the preceding two books and gives the infinitude of prime numbers (proposition 20), the sum of a  geometric series  (proposition 35), and the construction of even  perfect numbers  (proposition 36).   Book 10 attempts to classify  incommensurable  (in modern language,  irrational ) magnitudes by using the  method of exhaustion , a precursor to  integration .     Books 11 through 13 deal with spatial geometry:     Book 11 generalizes the results of Books 16 to space: perpendicularity, parallelism, volumes of  parallelepipeds .   Book 12 calculates areas and volumes by using the method of exhaustion:  cones ,  pyramids ,  cylinders , and the  sphere .   Book 13 constructs the five regular  Platonic solids  inscribed in a sphere, calculates the ratio of their edges to the radius of the sphere, and proves that there are no further regular solids.       [ edit ]   Euclid's method and style of presentation   Euclid's axiomatic approach was widely influential.   Euclidean geometry is  constructive .   As was common in ancient mathematical texts, when a proposition needed proof in several different cases, Euclid often proved only one of them (often the most difficult), leaving the others to the reader. Later editors such as  Theon  often interpolated their own proofs of these cases.   Euclid did not intend his list of axioms to be exhaustive, but rather intended them to represent the principles that were the most important. His proofs often invoke axiomatic notions which were not originally presented in his list of axioms. [ 13 ]   Euclid's presentation was limited by the mathematical ideas and notations in common currency in his era, and this causes the treatment to seem awkward to the modern reader in some places. For example, there was no notion of an angle greater than two right angles.     [ edit ]   Apocrypha   It was not uncommon in ancient time to attribute to celebrated authors works that were not written by them. It is by these means that the  apocryphal  books XIV and XV of the  Elements  were sometimes included in the collection. [ 14 ]  The spurious Book XIV was likely written by  Hypsicles  on the basis of a treatise by  Apollonius . The book continues Euclid's comparison of regular solids inscribed in spheres, with the chief result being that the ratio of the surfaces of the  dodecahedron  and  icosahedron  inscribed in the same sphere is the same as the ratio of their volumes, the ratio being  .   The spurious Book XV was likely written, at least in part, by  Isidore of Miletus . This inferior book covers topics such as counting the number of edges and solid angles in the regular solids, and finding the measure of dihedral angles of faces that meet at an edge.

Euclidean geometry  is a mathematical system attributed to the  Greek mathematician   Euclid  of  Alexandria .  Euclid's  Elements  is the earliest known systematic discussion of  geometry . It has been one of the most influential books in history, as much for its method as for its mathematical content. The method consists of assuming a small set of intuitively appealing  axioms , and then proving many other  propositions  ( theorems ) from those axioms. Although many of Euclid's results had been stated by earlier Greek mathematicians, Euclid was the first to show how these propositions could be fit together into a comprehensive deductive and  logical system .The  Elements  begin with  plane geometry , still taught in  secondary school  as the first  axiomatic system  and the first examples of  formal proof . It goes on to the  solid geometry  of three  dimensions . Much of the  Elements  states results of what is now called  number theory , proved using geometrical methods.   For over two thousand years, the adjective ""Euclidean"" was unnecessary because no other sort of geometry had been conceived. Euclid's axioms seemed so intuitively obvious that any theorem proved from them was deemed true in an absolute sense. Today, however, many other  self-consistent   non-Euclidean geometries  are known, the first ones having been discovered in the early 19th century. It also is no longer taken for granted that Euclidean geometry describes physical space. An implication of  Einstein 's theory of  general relativity  is that Euclidean geometry is a good approximation to the properties of physical space only if the  gravitational field  is not too strong.

Its superiority over earlier treatments was rapidly recognized, with the result that there was little interest in preserving the earlier ones, and they are now nearly all lost.   Books I-IV discuss plane geometry. Many results about plane figures are proved, e.g.,  If a triangle has two equal angles, then the sides subtended by the angles are equal.  The  Pythagorean theorem  is proved. [ 2 ]   Books V-X deal with number theory, with numbers treated geometrically via their representation as line segments with various lengths. Notions such as  prime numbers  and  rational  and  irrational  numbers are introduced. The infinitude of prime numbers is proved.   Books XI-XIII concern solid geometry. A typical result is the 1:3 ratio between the volume of a cone and a cylinder with the same height and base.     [ edit ]   Axiomatic treatment          A proof from Euclid's elements that, given a line segment, an equilateral triangle exists that includes the segment as one of its sides. The proof is by construction: an equilateral triangle  is made by drawing circles  and  centered on the points  and , and taking one intersection of the circles as the third vertex of the triangle.       Euclidean geometry is an  axiomatic system , in which all  theorems  (""true statements"") are derived from a small number of axioms. Near the beginning of the first book of the  Elements , Euclid gives five  postulates  (axioms) for plane geometry: [ 3 ]     Let the following be postulated: to draw a  straight line  from any  point  to any point.   To produce [extend] a  finite straight line  continuously in a straight line.   To describe a  circle  with any center and distance [radius].   That all right angles are equal to one another.   The  parallel postulate : That, if a straight line falling on two straight lines make the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which are the angles less than the two right angles.     The  Elements  also include the following five ""common notions"":     Things that equal the same thing also equal one another.   If equals are added to equals, then the wholes are equal.   If equals are subtracted from equals, then the remainders are equal.   Things that coincide with one another equal one another.   The whole is greater than the part.       [ edit ]   Constructive approach   Euclidean geometry is  constructive . Postulates 1, 2, 3, and 5 assert the existence and uniqueness of certain geometric figures, and these assertions are of a constructive nature: that is, we are not only told that certain things exist, but are also given methods for creating them with no more than a  compass and an unmarked straightedge . [ 4 ]  In this sense, Euclidean geometry is more concrete than many modern axiomatic systems such as  set theory , which often assert the existence of objects without saying how to construct them, or even assert the existence of objects that cannot be constructed within the theory. Strictly speaking, the lines on paper are  models  of the objects defined within the formal system, rather than instances of those objects. For example a Euclidean straight line has no width, but any real drawn line will. Although  nonconstructive methods  are today considered by nearly all mathematicians to be just as sound as constructive ones, Euclid's constructive proofs often supplanted fallacious nonconstructive ones, e.g., some of the Pythagoreans' proofs involving irrational numbers, which usually required a statement such as ""Find the greatest common measure of ..."" [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   The parallel postulate       Main article:  Parallel postulate              The parallel postulate: If two lines intersect a third in such a way that the sum of the inner angles on one side is less than two right angles, then the two lines inevitably must intersect each other on that side if extended far enough.       To the ancients, the parallel postulate seemed less obvious than the others. Euclid himself seems to have considered it as being qualitatively different from the others, as evidenced by the organization of the  Elements : the first 28 propositions he presents are those that can be proved without it.   Many alternative axioms can be formulated that have the same logical consequences as the parallel postulate. For example  Playfair's axiom  states:     Through a point not on a given straight line, at most one line can be drawn that never meets the given line.       [ edit ]   System of measurement and arithmetic   Euclidean geometry has two fundamental types of measurements: angle and distance. The angle scale is absolute, and Euclid uses the right angle as his basic unit, so that, e.g., a 45-degree angle would be referred to as half of a right angle. The distance scale is relative; one arbitrarily picks a line with a certain length as the unit, and other distances are expressed in relation to it.   A line in Euclidean geometry is a model of the  real number line . Addition is represented by a construction in which one line is copied onto the end of another line to extend its length, and similarly for subtraction.   Measurements of area and volume are derived from distances. For example, a rectangle with a width of 3 and a length of 4 has an area that represents the product, 12. Because this geometrical interpretation of multiplication was limited to three dimensions, there was no direct way of interpreting the product of four or more numbers, and Euclid avoided such products, although they are implied, e.g., in the proof of book IX, proposition 20.          An example of congruence. The two figures on the left are congruent, while the third is  similar  to them. The last figure is neither. Note that congruences alter some properties, such as location and orientation, but leave others unchanged, like  distance  and  angles . The latter sort of properties are called  invariants  and studying them is the essence of geometry.       Euclid refers to a pair of lines, or a pair of planar or solid figures, as ""equal"" () if their lengths, areas, or volumes are equal, and similarly for angles. The stronger term "" congruent "" refers to the idea that an entire figure is the same size and shape as another figure. Alternatively, two figures are congruent if one can be moved on top of the other so that it matches up with it exactly. (Flipping it over is allowed.) Thus, for example, a 2x6 rectangle and a 3x4 rectangle are equal but not congruent, and the letter R is congruent to its mirror image. Figures that would be congruent except for their differing sizes are referred to as  similar .     [ edit ]   Notation and terminology     [ edit ]   Naming of points and figures   Points are customarily named using capital letters of the alphabet. Other figures, such as lines, triangles, or circles, are named by listing a sufficient number of points to pick them out unambiguously from the relevant figure, e.g., triangle ABC would typically be a triangle with vertices at points A, B, and C.     [ edit ]   Complementary and supplementary angles   Angles whose sum is a right angle are called  complementary , those whose sum is two right angles  supplementary .     [ edit ]   Modern versions of Euclid's notation   In modern terminology, angles would normally be measured in  degrees  or  radians .   Modern school textbooks often define separate figures called  lines  (infinite),  rays  (semi-infinite), and  line segments  (of finite length). Euclid, rather than discussing a ray as an object that extends to infinity in one direction, would normally use locutions such as ""if the line is extended to a sufficient length,"" although he occasionally referred to ""infinite lines."" A ""line"" in Euclid could be either straight or curved, and he used the more specific term ""straight line"" when necessary.     [ edit ]   Some important or well known results                   The  bridge of asses  theorem states that A=B and C=D.                     The sum of angles A, B, and C is equal to 180 degrees.                     The Pythagorean theorem: The sum of the areas of the two squares on the legs ( a  and  b ) equals the area of the square on the hypotenuse ( c ).                     Thales' theorem: if AC is a diameter, then the angle at B is a right angle.               [ edit ]   The bridge of asses   The  bridge of asses  ( pons asinorum ) states that  In isosceles triangles the angles at the base equal one another, and, if the equal straight lines are produced further, then the angles under the base equal one another. [ 6 ]  Its name is attributed to its frequent role as the first real test in the Elements of the intelligence of the reader and as a bridge to the harder propositions that followed.          Congruence of triangles is determined by specifying two sides and the angle between them (SAS), two angles and the side between them (ASA) or two angles and a corresponding adjacent side (AAS). Specifying two sides and an adjacent angle (SSA), however, can yield two distinct possible triangles.         [ edit ]   Congruence of triangles   Triangles are congruent if they have all three sides equal (SSS), two sides and the angle between them (SAS), or two angles and a side (AAS) (Book I, propositions 4, 8, and 26). (Triangles with three equal angles are generally similar, but not necessarily congruent. Triangles with two equal sides and an adjacent angle are not necessarily equal.)     [ edit ]   Sum of the angles of a triangle   The sum of the angles of a triangle is equal to two right angles (180 degrees). [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   The Pythagorean theorem   The celebrated  Pythagorean theorem  (book I, proposition 47) states that in any right triangle, the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares whose sides are the two legs (the two sides that meet at a right angle).     [ edit ]   Thales' theorem   Thales' theorem (book I, proposition 32, named after  Thales of Miletus ) states that if A, B and C are points on a circle where the line AC is a diameter of the circle, then the angle ABC is a right angle. Tradition has it that Thales sacrificed an ox to celebrate this theorem. [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Infinitude of prime numbers   ""Prime numbers are more than any any assigned multitude of prime numbers,"" [ 9 ]  i.e., there are infinitely many prime numbers (book IX, proposition 20).     [ edit ]   Summation of geometrical series   For  , the sum of the partial  geometric series  is [ 10 ]           [ edit ]   Scaling of area and volume   In modern terminology, the area of a plane figure is proportional to the square of any of its linear dimensions,  , and the volume of a solid to the cube,  . Euclid proved these results in various special cases, e.g., for the area of a circle, [ 11 ]  and the volume of a parallelepipedal solid [ 12 ] . Euclid determined some, but not all, of the relevant constants of proportionality. E.g., it was his successor  Archimedes  who proved that a sphere has 2/3 the volume of the circumscribing cylinder. [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   Applications   Because of Euclidean geometry's fundamental status in mathematics, it would be impossible to give more than a representative sampling of applications here.                   A surveyor uses a  theodolite                     Sphere packing  applies to a stack of  oranges .                     A parabolic mirror brings parallel rays of light to a focus.             One of the earliest reasons for interest in geometry was  surveying , [ 14 ]  and certain practical results from Euclidean geometry, such as the right-angle property of the 3-4-5 triangle, were probably used long before they were proved formally. The fundamental types of measurements in Euclidean geometry are distances and angles, and both of these quantities can be measured directly by a surveyor. Historically, distances were often measured by chains such as  Gunter's chain , and angles using graduated circles and, later, the  theodolite .   An application of Euclidean solid geometry is the determination of packing arrangements, such as the problem of finding the most efficient  packing of spheres  in n dimensions. This problem has applications in  error detection and correction .   Geometric optics  uses Euclidean geometry to analyze the focusing of light by lenses and mirrors.                   Geometry is used in art and architecture.                     The water tower consists of a cone, a cylinder, and a hemisphere. Its volume can be calculated using solid geometry.                     Geometry can be used to design  origami .             Geometry is used extensively in architecture.   Geometry can be used to design  origami . Some  classical construction problems of geometry  are impossible using  compass and straightedge , but can be solved using origami. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Later work     [ edit ]   The 17th century: Descartes   Ren Descartes (1596-1650) developed  analytic geometry , an alternative method for formalizing geometry. [ 16 ]  In this approach, a point is represented by its  Cartesian  (x,y) coordinates, a line is represented by its equation, and so on. In Euclid's original approach, the  Pythagorean theorem  follows from Euclid's axioms. In the Cartesian approach, the axioms are the axioms of algebra, and the equation expressing the Pythagorean theorem is then a definition of one of the terms in Euclid's axioms, which are now considered to be theorems. The equation: defining the distance between two points  P  = ( p , q )  and  Q  = ( r , s )  is then known as the  Euclidean  metric , and other metrics define  non-Euclidean geometries .          Squaring the circle: the areas of this square and this circle are equal. In 1882, it was proven that this figure cannot be constructed in a finite number of steps with an idealized  compass and straightedge .       In terms of analytic geometry, the restriction of classical geometry to compass and straightedge constructions means a restriction to first- and second-order equations, e.g., y=2x+1 (a line), or x 2 +y 2 =7 (a circle).     [ edit ]   The 18th century   Geometers of the 18th century struggled to define the boundaries of the Euclidean system. Many tried in vain to prove the fifth postulate from the first four. By 1763 at least 28 different proofs had been published, but all were found to be incorrect. [ 17 ]   Leading up to this period, geometers also tried to determine what constructions could be accomplished in Euclidean geometry. For example, the problem of  trisecting an angle  with a compass and straightedge is one that naturally occurs within the theory, since the axioms refer to constructive operations that can be carried out with those tools. However, centuries of efforts failed to find a solution to this problem, until  Pierre Wantzel  published a proof in 1837 that such a construction was impossible. Other constructions proved to be impossible include  doubling the cube  and  squaring the circle . In the case of doubling the cube, the impossibility of the construction originates from the fact that the compass and straightedge method involve first- and second-order equations, while doubling a cube requires the solution of a third-order equation.   Euler  discussed a generalization of Euclidean geometry called  affine geometry , which retains the fifth postulate unmodified while weakening postulates three and four in a way that eliminates the notions of angle (whence right triangles become meaningless) and of equality of length of line segments in general (whence circles become meaningless) while retaining the notions of parallelism as an equivalence relation between lines, and equality of length of parallel line segments (so line segments continue to have a midpoint).     [ edit ]   The 19th century and noneuclidean geometry   Around 1830, the  Jnos Bolyai  and  Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky  separately published work on  noneuclidean geometry , in which the parallel postulate is not valid. [ 18 ]  Since noneuclidean geometry is provably self-consistent, the parallel postulate cannot be proved from the other postulates.   In the 19th century, it was also realized that Euclid's ten axioms and common notions do not suffice to prove all of theorems stated in the  Elements . For example, Euclid assumed implicitly that any line contains at least two points, but this assumption cannot be proved from the other axioms, and therefore needs to be an axiom itself. The very first geometric proof in the  Elements,  shown in the figure above, is that any line segment is part of a triangle; Euclid constructs this in the usual way, by drawing circles around both endpoints and taking their intersection as the third  vertex . His axioms, however, do not guarantee that the circles actually intersect, because they are consistent with discrete, rather than continuous, space. Starting with  Moritz Pasch  in 1882, many improved axiomatic systems for geometry have been proposed, the best known being those of  Hilbert , [ 19 ]   George Birkhoff , [ 20 ]  and  Tarski . [ 21 ]     [ edit ]   The 20th century and general relativity          A disproof of Euclidean geometry as a description of physical space. In a 1919 test of the general theory of relativity, stars (marked with short horizontal lines) were photographed during a solar  eclipse . The rays of starlight were bent by the Sun's gravity on their way to the earth. This is interpreted as evidence in favor of Einstein's prediction that gravity would cause deviations from Euclidean geometry.       Euclid believed that his axioms were self-evident statements about physical reality. Taken as a physical description of space, postulate 2 (extending a line) asserts that space does not have holes or boundaries (i.e., space is homogenous); postulate 3 (constructing a circle) asserts that space is infinite, [ 22 ]  since there is no limit on the radius of the circle; 4 (equality of right angles) says that space is homogeneous and isotropic, so that figures may be moved to any location while maintaining congruence; and 5 that space is flat. [ 23 ]   However,  Einstein's  theory of  general relativity  shows that the true geometry of spacetime is  non-Euclidean geometry . [ 24 ]  For example, if a triangle is constructed out of three rays of light, then in general the interior angles do not add up to 180 degrees due to gravity. A relatively weak gravitational field, such as the Earth's or the sun's, is represented by a metric that is approximately, but not exactly, Euclidean. Until the 20th century, there was no technology capable of detecting the deviations from Euclidean geometry, but Einstein predicted that such deviations would exist. They were later verified by observations such as the observation of the slight bending of starlight by the Sun during a solar eclipse in 1919, and  non-Euclidean geometry  is now, for example, an integral part of the software that runs the  GPS  system. [ 25 ]  It is possible to object to the non-Euclidean interpretation of general relativity on the grounds that light rays might be improper physical models of Euclid's lines, or that relativity could be rephrased so as to avoid the geometrical interpretations. However, one of the consequences of Einstein's theory is that there is no possible physical test that can do any better than a beam of light as a model of geometry. Thus, the only logical possibilities are to accept  non-Euclidean geometry  as physically real, or to reject the entire notion of physical tests of the axioms of geometry, which can then be imagined as a formal system without any intrinsic real-world meaning.     [ edit ]   Treatment of infinity     [ edit ]   Infinite objects   Euclid sometimes distinguished explicitly between ""finite lines"" (e.g., Postulate 2) and "" infinite  lines."" (book I, proposition 12) However, he typically did not make such distinctions unless they were necessary, and postulates 1, 3, and 4 are consistent with  elliptic geometry , in which there is a finite limit on the length of any line.   The notion of  infinitesimally small quantities  had previously been discussed extensively by the  Eleatic School , but nobody had been able to put them on a firm logical basis, with paradoxes such as  Zeno's paradox  occurring that had not been resolved to universal satisfaction. Euclid used the  method of exhaustion  rather than infinitesimals. [ 26 ]   Later ancient commentators such as  Proclus  (410-485 CE) treated many questions about infinity as issues demanding proof and, e.g., Proclus claimed to prove the infinite divisibility of a line, based on a proof by contradiction in which he considered the cases of even and odd numbers of points constituting it. [ 27 ]   At the turn of the 20th century,  Giuseppe Veronese  produced controversial work on  non-Archimedean  models of Euclidean geometry, in which the distance between two points may be infinite or infinitesimal, in the  Newton - Leibniz  sense. [ 28 ]  Fifty years later,  Abraham Robinson  provided a rigorous logical foundation for Veronese's work. [ 29 ]     [ edit ]   Infinite processes   One reason that the ancients treated the parallel postulate as less certain than the others is that verifying it physically would require us to inspect two lines to check that they never intersected, even at some very distant point, and this inspection could potentially take an infinite amount of time. [ 30 ]   The modern formulation of  proof by induction  was not developed until the 17th century, but later commentators consider it to be implicit in some of Euclid's proofs, e.g., the proof of the infinitude of primes. [ 31 ]     [ edit ]   Logical basis   Euclid frequently used the method of  proof by contradiction , and therefore the traditional presentation of Euclidean geometry assumes  classical logic , in which every proposition is either true or false, i.e., for any proposition P, the proposition ""P or not P"" is automatically true.   Tarski  (1902-1983) and his students demonstrated for the first time that Euclidean geometry can be expressed as a  first-order theory . That is, it can be written entirely in a form that allows statements such as ""for all triangles ..."", without those like ""for all  sets  of triangles ..."" This is important because it shows that the subject does not depend on  set theory  for its logical basis. Tarski proved his  axiomatic formulation  of Euclidean geometry to be complete in a certain  sense : there is an algorithm which, for every proposition, can show it to be either true or false.

(The figure depicted may be either  Archimedes  or  Euclid , and despite the painting's popular name, neither was Athenian.)       Euclidean geometry  is a mathematical system attributed to the  Greek mathematician   Euclid  of  Alexandria .  Euclid's  Elements  is the earliest known systematic discussion of  geometry . It has been one of the most influential books in history, as much for its method as for its mathematical content. The method consists of assuming a small set of intuitively appealing  axioms , and then proving many other  propositions  ( theorems ) from those axioms. Although many of Euclid's results had been stated by earlier mathematicians, [ 1 ]  Euclid was the first to show how these propositions could be fit together into a comprehensive deductive and  logical system . [ 2 ]  The  Elements  begin with  plane geometry , still taught in  secondary school  as the first  axiomatic system  and the first examples of  formal proof . It goes on to the  solid geometry  of three  dimensions . Much of the  Elements  states results of what are now called  algebra  and  number theory , couched in geometrical language. [ 3 ]   For over two thousand years, the adjective ""Euclidean"" was unnecessary because no other sort of geometry had been conceived. Euclid's axioms seemed so intuitively obvious that any theorem proved from them was deemed true in an absolute sense. Today, however, many other  self-consistent   non-Euclidean geometries  are known, the first ones having been discovered in the early 19th century. It also is no longer taken for granted that Euclidean geometry describes physical space. An implication of  Einstein 's theory of  general relativity  is that Euclidean geometry is a good approximation to the properties of physical space only if the  gravitational field  is not too strong.

Its superiority over earlier treatments was rapidly recognized, with the result that there was little interest in preserving the earlier ones, and they are now nearly all lost.   Books I-IV discuss plane geometry. Many results about plane figures are proved, e.g.,  If a triangle has two equal angles, then the sides subtended by the angles are equal.  The  Pythagorean theorem  is proved. [ 5 ]   Books V-X deal with number theory, with numbers treated geometrically via their representation as line segments with various lengths. Notions such as  prime numbers  and  rational  and  irrational  numbers are introduced. The infinitude of prime numbers is proved.   Books XI-XIII concern solid geometry. A typical result is the 1:3 ratio between the volume of a cone and a cylinder with the same height and base.          The parallel postulate: If two lines intersect a third in such a way that the sum of the inner angles on one side is less than two right angles, then the two lines inevitably must intersect each other on that side if extended far enough.         [ edit ]   Axioms   Euclidean geometry is an  axiomatic system , in which all  theorems  (""true statements"") are derived from a small number of axioms. Near the beginning of the first book of the  Elements , Euclid gives five  postulates  (axioms) for plane geometry, stated in terms of constructions: [ 6 ]     Let the following be postulated: to draw a  straight line  from any  point  to any point.   To produce [extend] a  finite straight line  continuously in a straight line.   To describe a  circle  with any center and distance [radius].   That all right angles are equal to one another.   The  parallel postulate : That, if a straight line falling on two straight lines make the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which are the angles less than the two right angles.     Although Euclid's statement of the postulates only explicitly asserts the existence of the constructions, they are also taken to be unique.   The  Elements  also include the following five ""common notions"":     Things that equal the same thing also equal one another.   If equals are added to equals, then the wholes are equal.   If equals are subtracted from equals, then the remainders are equal.   Things that coincide with one another equal one another.   The whole is greater than the part.       [ edit ]   The parallel postulate   Main article:  Parallel postulate   To the ancients, the parallel postulate seemed less obvious than the others. Euclid himself seems to have considered it as being qualitatively different from the others, as evidenced by the organization of the  Elements : the first 28 propositions he presents are those that can be proved without it.   Many alternative axioms can be formulated that have the same logical consequences as the parallel postulate. For example  Playfair's axiom  states:     Through a point not on a given straight line, at most one line can be drawn that never meets the given line.            A proof from Euclid's elements that, given a line segment, an equilateral triangle exists that includes the segment as one of its sides. The proof is by construction: an equilateral triangle  is made by drawing circles  and  centered on the points  and , and taking one intersection of the circles as the third vertex of the triangle.         [ edit ]   Methods of proof   Euclidean geometry is  constructive . Postulates 1, 2, 3, and 5 assert the existence and uniqueness of certain geometric figures, and these assertions are of a constructive nature: that is, we are not only told that certain things exist, but are also given methods for creating them with no more than a  compass and an unmarked straightedge . [ 7 ]  In this sense, Euclidean geometry is more concrete than many modern axiomatic systems such as  set theory , which often assert the existence of objects without saying how to construct them, or even assert the existence of objects that cannot be constructed within the theory. Strictly speaking, the lines on paper are  models  of the objects defined within the formal system, rather than instances of those objects. For example a Euclidean straight line has no width, but any real drawn line will. Although  nonconstructive methods  are today considered by nearly all mathematicians to be just as sound as constructive ones, Euclid's constructive proofs often supplanted fallacious nonconstructive ones, e.g., some of the Pythagoreans' proofs involving irrational numbers, which usually required a statement such as ""Find the greatest common measure of ..."" [ 8 ]   Euclid often used  proof by contradiction . Euclidean geometry also allows the method of superposition, in which a figure is transferred to another point in space. For example, proposition I.4, side-angle-side congruence of triangles, is proved by moving one of the two triangles so that one of its sides coincides with the other triangle's equal side, and then proving that the other sides coincide as well.     [ edit ]   System of measurement and arithmetic   Euclidean geometry has two fundamental types of measurements: angle and distance. The angle scale is absolute, and Euclid uses the right angle as his basic unit, so that, e.g., a 45-degree angle would be referred to as half of a right angle. The distance scale is relative; one arbitrarily picks a line with a certain length as the unit, and other distances are expressed in relation to it.   A line in Euclidean geometry is a model of the  real number line . Addition is represented by a construction in which one line is copied onto the end of another line to extend its length, and similarly for subtraction.   Measurements of area and volume are derived from distances. For example, a rectangle with a width of 3 and a length of 4 has an area that represents the product, 12. Because this geometrical interpretation of multiplication was limited to three dimensions, there was no direct way of interpreting the product of four or more numbers, and Euclid avoided such products, although they are implied, e.g., in the proof of book IX, proposition 20.          An example of congruence. The two figures on the left are congruent, while the third is  similar  to them. The last figure is neither. Note that congruences alter some properties, such as location and orientation, but leave others unchanged, like  distance  and  angles . The latter sort of properties are called  invariants  and studying them is the essence of geometry.       Euclid refers to a pair of lines, or a pair of planar or solid figures, as ""equal"" () if their lengths, areas, or volumes are equal, and similarly for angles. The stronger term "" congruent "" refers to the idea that an entire figure is the same size and shape as another figure. Alternatively, two figures are congruent if one can be moved on top of the other so that it matches up with it exactly. (Flipping it over is allowed.) Thus, for example, a 2x6 rectangle and a 3x4 rectangle are equal but not congruent, and the letter R is congruent to its mirror image. Figures that would be congruent except for their differing sizes are referred to as  similar .     [ edit ]   Notation and terminology     [ edit ]   Naming of points and figures   Points are customarily named using capital letters of the alphabet. Other figures, such as lines, triangles, or circles, are named by listing a sufficient number of points to pick them out unambiguously from the relevant figure, e.g., triangle ABC would typically be a triangle with vertices at points A, B, and C.     [ edit ]   Complementary and supplementary angles   Angles whose sum is a right angle are called  complementary , those whose sum is two right angles  supplementary .     [ edit ]   Modern versions of Euclid's notation   In modern terminology, angles would normally be measured in  degrees  or  radians .   Modern school textbooks often define separate figures called  lines  (infinite),  rays  (semi-infinite), and  line segments  (of finite length). Euclid, rather than discussing a ray as an object that extends to infinity in one direction, would normally use locutions such as ""if the line is extended to a sufficient length,"" although he occasionally referred to ""infinite lines."" A ""line"" in Euclid could be either straight or curved, and he used the more specific term ""straight line"" when necessary.     [ edit ]   Some important or well known results                   The  bridge of asses  theorem states that A=B and C=D.                     The sum of angles A, B, and C is equal to 180 degrees.                     The Pythagorean theorem: The sum of the areas of the two squares on the legs ( a  and  b ) equals the area of the square on the hypotenuse ( c ).                     Thales' theorem: if AC is a diameter, then the angle at B is a right angle.               [ edit ]   The bridge of asses   The  bridge of asses  ( pons asinorum ) states that  In isosceles triangles the angles at the base equal one another, and, if the equal straight lines are produced further, then the angles under the base equal one another. [ 9 ]  Its name is attributed to its frequent role as the first real test in the Elements of the intelligence of the reader and as a bridge to the harder propositions that followed.          Congruence of triangles is determined by specifying two sides and the angle between them (SAS), two angles and the side between them (ASA) or two angles and a corresponding adjacent side (AAS). Specifying two sides and an adjacent angle (SSA), however, can yield two distinct possible triangles.         [ edit ]   Congruence of triangles   Triangles are congruent if they have all three sides equal (SSS), two sides and the angle between them (SAS), or two angles and a side (AAS) (Book I, propositions 4, 8, and 26). (Triangles with three equal angles are generally similar, but not necessarily congruent. Triangles with two equal sides and an adjacent angle are not necessarily equal.)     [ edit ]   Sum of the angles of a triangle   The sum of the angles of a triangle is equal to two right angles (180 degrees). [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   The Pythagorean theorem   The celebrated  Pythagorean theorem  (book I, proposition 47) states that in any right triangle, the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares whose sides are the two legs (the two sides that meet at a right angle).     [ edit ]   Thales' theorem   Thales' theorem (book I, proposition 32, named after  Thales of Miletus ) states that if A, B and C are points on a circle where the line AC is a diameter of the circle, then the angle ABC is a right angle. Tradition has it that Thales sacrificed an ox to celebrate this theorem. [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Scaling of area and volume   In modern terminology, the area of a plane figure is proportional to the square of any of its linear dimensions,  , and the volume of a solid to the cube,  . Euclid proved these results in various special cases such as the area of a circle [ 12 ]  and the volume of a parallelepipedal solid [ 13 ] . Euclid determined some, but not all, of the relevant constants of proportionality. E.g., it was his successor  Archimedes  who proved that a sphere has 2/3 the volume of the circumscribing cylinder. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Applications         This section requires  expansion .       Because of Euclidean geometry's fundamental status in mathematics, it would be impossible to give more than a representative sampling of applications here.                   A surveyor uses a  theodolite                     Sphere packing  applies to a stack of  oranges .                     A parabolic mirror brings parallel rays of light to a focus.             As suggested by the etymology of the word, one of the earliest reasons for interest in geometry was  surveying , [ 15 ]  and certain practical results from Euclidean geometry, such as the right-angle property of the 3-4-5 triangle, were used long before they were proved formally. [ 16 ]  The fundamental types of measurements in Euclidean geometry are distances and angles, and both of these quantities can be measured directly by a surveyor. Historically, distances were often measured by chains such as  Gunter's chain , and angles using graduated circles and, later, the  theodolite .   An application of Euclidean solid geometry is the determination of packing arrangements, such as the problem of finding the most efficient  packing of spheres  in n dimensions. This problem has applications in  error detection and correction .   Geometric optics  uses Euclidean geometry to analyze the focusing of light by lenses and mirrors.                   Geometry is used in art and architecture.                     The water tower consists of a cone, a cylinder, and a hemisphere. Its volume can be calculated using solid geometry.                     Geometry can be used to design  origami .             Geometry is used extensively in architecture.   Geometry can be used to design  origami . Some  classical construction problems of geometry  are impossible using  compass and straightedge , but can be solved using origami. [ 17 ]     [ edit ]   As a description of the structure of space   Euclid believed that his axioms were self-evident statements about physical reality. Taken as a physical description of space, postulate 2 (extending a line) asserts that space does not have holes or boundaries (i.e., space is homogenous); postulate 4 (equality of right angles) says that space is homogeneous and isotropic, so that figures may be moved to any location while maintaining congruence; and postulate 5 that space is flat (has no  intrinsic curvature ). [ 18 ]  As discussed in more detail below, Einstein's theory of relativity significantly modifies this view.   The ambiguous character of the axioms as originally formulated by Euclid makes it possible for different commentators to disagree about some of their other implications for the structure of space, such as whether or not it is infinite [ 19 ]  (see below) and what its  topology  is. Modern, more rigorous reformulations of the system [ 20 ]  typically aim for a cleaner separation of these issues. Interpreting Euclid's axioms in the spirit of this more modern approach, axioms 1-4 are consistent with either infinite or finite space (as in  elliptic geometry ), and all five axioms are consistent with a variety of topologies (e.g., a plane, a cylinder, or a torus for two-dimensional Euclidean geometry).     [ edit ]   Later work     [ edit ]   Archimedes and Apollonius          A sphere has 2/3 the volume and surface area of its circumscribing cylinder. A sphere and cylinder were placed on the tomb of Archimedes at his request.       Archimedes  (ca. 287 BCE  ca. 212 BCE), a colorful figure about whom many historical anecdotes are recorded, is remembered along with Euclid as one of the greatest of ancient mathematicians. Although the foundations of his work were put in place by Euclid, his work, unlike Euclid's, is believed to have been entirely his own original accomplishment. [ 21 ]  He proved equations for the volumes and areas of various figures in two and three dimensions, and enunciated the  Archimedean property  property of finite numbers.  Apollonius of Perga  (ca. 262 BCEca. 190 BCE) is mainly known for his investigation of conic sections.          Ren Descartes. Portrait after  Frans Hals , 1648.         [ edit ]   The 17th century: Descartes   Ren Descartes  (1596-1650) developed  analytic geometry , an alternative method for formalizing geometry. [ 22 ]  In this approach, a point is represented by its  Cartesian  (x,y) coordinates, a line is represented by its equation, and so on. In Euclid's original approach, the  Pythagorean theorem  follows from Euclid's axioms. In the Cartesian approach, the axioms are the axioms of algebra, and the equation expressing the Pythagorean theorem is then a definition of one of the terms in Euclid's axioms, which are now considered to be theorems. The equation: defining the distance between two points  P  = ( p , q )  and  Q  = ( r , s )  is then known as the  Euclidean  metric , and other metrics define  non-Euclidean geometries .   In terms of analytic geometry, the restriction of classical geometry to compass and straightedge constructions means a restriction to first- and second-order equations, e.g., y=2x+1 (a line), or x 2 +y 2 =7 (a circle).   Also in the 17th century,  Girard Desargues , motivated by the theory of  perspective , introduced the concept of idealized points, lines, and planes at infinity. The result can be considered as a type of generalized geometry,  projective geometry , but it can also be used to produce proofs in ordinary Euclidean geometry in which the number of special cases is reduced. [ 23 ]          Squaring the circle: the areas of this square and this circle are equal. In 1882, it was proven that this figure cannot be constructed in a finite number of steps with an idealized  compass and straightedge .         [ edit ]   The 18th century   Geometers of the 18th century struggled to define the boundaries of the Euclidean system. Many tried in vain to prove the fifth postulate from the first four. By 1763 at least 28 different proofs had been published, but all were found to be incorrect. [ 24 ]   Leading up to this period, geometers also tried to determine what constructions could be accomplished in Euclidean geometry. For example, the problem of  trisecting an angle  with a compass and straightedge is one that naturally occurs within the theory, since the axioms refer to constructive operations that can be carried out with those tools. However, centuries of efforts failed to find a solution to this problem, until  Pierre Wantzel  published a proof in 1837 that such a construction was impossible. Other constructions that were proved to be impossible include  doubling the cube  and  squaring the circle . In the case of doubling the cube, the impossibility of the construction originates from the fact that the compass and straightedge method involve first- and second-order equations, while doubling a cube requires the solution of a third-order equation.   Euler  discussed a generalization of Euclidean geometry called  affine geometry , which retains the fifth postulate unmodified while weakening postulates three and four in a way that eliminates the notions of angle (whence right triangles become meaningless) and of equality of length of line segments in general (whence circles become meaningless) while retaining the notions of parallelism as an equivalence relation between lines, and equality of length of parallel line segments (so line segments continue to have a midpoint).     [ edit ]   The 19th century and noneuclidean geometry   In the early 19th century,  Carnot  and  Mbius  systematically developed the use of signed angles and line segments as a way of simplifying and unifying results. [ 25 ]   The century's most significant development in geometry occurred when, around 1830,  Jnos Bolyai  and  Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky  separately published work on  noneuclidean geometry , in which the parallel postulate is not valid. [ 26 ]  Since noneuclidean geometry is provably self-consistent, the parallel postulate cannot be proved from the other postulates.   In the 19th century, it was also realized that Euclid's ten axioms and common notions do not suffice to prove all of theorems stated in the  Elements . For example, Euclid assumed implicitly that any line contains at least two points, but this assumption cannot be proved from the other axioms, and therefore needs to be an axiom itself. The very first geometric proof in the  Elements,  shown in the figure above, is that any line segment is part of a triangle; Euclid constructs this in the usual way, by drawing circles around both endpoints and taking their intersection as the third  vertex . His axioms, however, do not guarantee that the circles actually intersect, because they do not assert the geometrical property of continuity, which in Cartesian terms is equivalent to the  completeness  property of the real numbers. Starting with  Moritz Pasch  in 1882, many improved axiomatic systems for geometry have been proposed, the best known being those of  Hilbert , [ 27 ]   George Birkhoff , [ 28 ]  and  Tarski . [ 29 ]     [ edit ]   The 20th century and general relativity          A disproof of Euclidean geometry as a description of physical space. In a 1919 test of the general theory of relativity, stars (marked with short horizontal lines) were photographed during a solar  eclipse . The rays of starlight were bent by the Sun's gravity on their way to the earth. This is interpreted as evidence in favor of Einstein's prediction that gravity would cause deviations from Euclidean geometry.       Einstein's  theory of  general relativity  shows that the true geometry of spacetime is  non-Euclidean geometry . [ 30 ]  For example, if a triangle is constructed out of three rays of light, then in general the interior angles do not add up to 180 degrees due to gravity. A relatively weak gravitational field, such as the Earth's or the sun's, is represented by a metric that is approximately, but not exactly, Euclidean. Until the 20th century, there was no technology capable of detecting the deviations from Euclidean geometry, but Einstein predicted that such deviations would exist. They were later verified by observations such as the observation of the slight bending of starlight by the Sun during a solar eclipse in 1919, and  non-Euclidean geometry  is now, for example, an integral part of the software that runs the  GPS  system. [ 31 ]  It is possible to object to the non-Euclidean interpretation of general relativity on the grounds that light rays might be improper physical models of Euclid's lines, or that relativity could be rephrased so as to avoid the geometrical interpretations. However, one of the consequences of Einstein's theory is that there is no possible physical test that can do any better than a beam of light as a model of geometry. Thus, the only logical possibilities are to accept  non-Euclidean geometry  as physically real, or to reject the entire notion of physical tests of the axioms of geometry, which can then be imagined as a formal system without any intrinsic real-world meaning.     [ edit ]   Treatment of infinity     [ edit ]   Infinite objects   Euclid sometimes distinguished explicitly between ""finite lines"" (e.g., Postulate 2) and "" infinite  lines"" (book I, proposition 12). However, he typically did not make such distinctions unless they were necessary. The postulates do not explicitly refer to infinite lines, although for example some commentators interpret postulate 3, existence of a circle with any radius, as implying that space is infinite. [ 32 ]   The notion of  infinitesimally small quantities  had previously been discussed extensively by the  Eleatic School , but nobody had been able to put them on a firm logical basis, with paradoxes such as  Zeno's paradox  occurring that had not been resolved to universal satisfaction. Euclid used the  method of exhaustion  rather than infinitesimals. [ 33 ]   Later ancient commentators such as  Proclus  (410-485 CE) treated many questions about infinity as issues demanding proof and, e.g., Proclus claimed to prove the infinite divisibility of a line, based on a proof by contradiction in which he considered the cases of even and odd numbers of points constituting it. [ 34 ]   At the turn of the 20th century,  Giuseppe Veronese  produced controversial work on  non-Archimedean  models of Euclidean geometry, in which the distance between two points may be infinite or infinitesimal, in the  Newton - Leibniz  sense. [ 35 ]  Fifty years later,  Abraham Robinson  provided a rigorous logical foundation for Veronese's work. [ 36 ]     [ edit ]   Infinite processes   One reason that the ancients treated the parallel postulate as less certain than the others is that verifying it physically would require us to inspect two lines to check that they never intersected, even at some very distant point, and this inspection could potentially take an infinite amount of time. [ 37 ]   The modern formulation of  proof by induction  was not developed until the 17th century, but some later commentators consider it to be implicit in some of Euclid's proofs, e.g., the proof of the infinitude of primes. [ 38 ]     [ edit ]   Logical basis   Euclid frequently used the method of  proof by contradiction , and therefore the traditional presentation of Euclidean geometry assumes  classical logic , in which every proposition is either true or false, i.e., for any proposition P, the proposition ""P or not P"" is automatically true.   Tarski  (1902-1983) and his students demonstrated for the first time that Euclidean geometry can be expressed as a  first-order theory . That is, it can be written entirely in a form that allows statements such as ""for all triangles ..."", without those like ""for all  sets  of triangles ..."" This is important because it shows that the subject does not depend on  set theory  for its logical basis. Tarski proved his  axiomatic formulation  of Euclidean geometry to be complete in a certain  sense : there is an algorithm which, for every proposition, can show it to be either true or false.

clueweb09-en0010-08-34373	"                 The  47 th  Problem of Euclid       (A.K.A. The Pythagorean  Theorem)           The problem above is  the 47th Problem of Euclid. It is an invention by an ancient Greek geometer,  Pythagoras, who worked for many years to devise a method of finding the length  of the hypothenuse of a right angle triangle. Pythagoras is credited with having  first proved the rule successfully applied to the problem.     The rule is that the  square of the base added to the square of the altitude equals the square of the  hypothenuse. The base of a right angle triangle is the side on which it rests,  marked B in the Figure above. The altitude is the height and is marked A. The  hypothenuse is the connecting side of the triangle, marked C above. The base, 6,  squared or multiplied by itself, equals 36. The altitude, 8, squared, equals 64.  By adding these together we have 100, which is the square of the hypothenuse. It  remains but to extract the square root of 100, which we know is 10, therefore 10  is the length of the hypothenuse or third side of this right angle triangle. All  right angle triangles can be figured in the same manner, but only multiples of  the length of the three sides come even -- such as 3, 4, 5 and 12, 16, 20, and  many others, of course.    Compiled by:  Wor.  David J. Lettelier  for a Public Oration and Lecture      The 47th problem of Euclid (called that because  Euclid included it in a book of numbered geometry problems) in which the sides  are 3, 4, and 5 -- all whole numbers -- is also known as ""the Egyptian string  trick.""      The ""trick"" is that you take a string and tie knots  in it to divide it into 12 divisions, the two ends joining.  (The divisions  must be correct and equal or this will not work.)      Then get 3 sticks -- thin ones, just strong enough  to stick them into soft soil.  Stab one stick in the ground and arrange a  knot at the stick, stretch three divisions away from it in any direction and  insert the second stick in the ground, then place the third stick so that it  falls on the knot between the 4-part and the 5-part division.  This forces  the creation of a 3 : 4 : 5 right triangle.  The angle between the 3 units  and the 4 units is of necessity a square or right angle.      The ancient Egyptians used the string trick to  create right angles when re-measuring their fields after the annual Nile floods  washed out boundary markers.  Their skill with this and other surveying  methods led to the widely held (but false) belief that the Egyptians invented  geometry (geo=earth, metry=measuring).      Thales the Greek supposedly picked the string trick  up while traveling in Egypt and took it back to Greece.  Some say that the  Greek mathematician and geometer Pythagoras, described in Masonic lectures as  ""our worthy brother,"" also went to Egypt and learned it there on his own.   In any case, it was he who supplied the PROOF that the angle formed by the 3 :  4: 5 triangle is invariably square and perfect.  It is also said that he  actually sacrificed a hecatomb, that is a sacrifice of one hundred bulls, which  ranked as the highest kind of religious offering, upon completing the proof.      How is this forty-seventh proposition the foundation  of all Masonry, and what was the significance of the problem which led to such a  demonstration by the ancient philosopher?        The knowledge contained in this proposition is at  the bottom of all systems of measurement and every mechanic at the present day  makes use of it consciously or unconsciously, whether it be the land surveyor  blocking out a township, or the gardener measuring out his tennis court, or the  carpenter calculating the pitch of a roof.  He may not know anything about  geometry, but the ""rule of thumb"" by which he works has been deduced from this  proposition.  To the practical builder the knowledge is invaluable, and if  we will carry ourselves back in imagination to a time when this knowledge was  still unknown, we will realize that its discovery was an event of great  importance in the history of architecture, an epoch-making event to be ranked  with such modern discoveries as those of the law of gravitation, wireless TV or  telephones, and space travel.      The Discovery of the 47th problem of  Euclid:  Euclid wrote a set of thirteen books, which were called lements Each book  contained many geometric propositions and explanations, and in total Euclid  published 465 problems.  The 47th problem was set out in Book 1, which is  also known as he Pythagorean Theorem  Why is it called by both these  names?  Although Euclid published the proposition, it was Pythagoras who  discovered it.  We learn from the third degree lecture that:       This wise philosopher (Pythagoras) enriched his mind abundantly in a  general knowledge of things, and more especially in Geometry, or Masonry. On  this subject he drew out many problems and theorems, and, among the most  distinguished, he erected this, when, in the joy of his heart, he exclaimed  Eureka, in the Greek language signifying, ""I have found it,"" and upon the  discovery of which he is said to have sacrificed a hecatomb. It teaches Masons  to be general lovers of the arts and sciences      To the operative mason it affords a means of  correcting his square, for if he wishes to test its accuracy he may readily do  so by measuring off 3 divisions along one side, 4 divisions along the other, and  the distance across must be 5 if the square is accurate.  The knowledge of  how to form a square without the possibility of error has always been accounted  of the highest importance in the art of building, and in times when knowledge  was limited to the few, might well be one of the genuine secrets of a Master  Mason.  The ancient temple builders in the long centuries before Christ  were most punctilious in setting their temples due east and west.  So  exacting were they on this point that there was organized a set of men who, in  modern phrase, would be termed experts or specialists, and whose sole duty it  was to lay out the foundations of public edifices.  They were called, in  Egypt,  harpedonaptae --meaning rope stretchers.  They first laid out  the north and south line by observation of the stars and the sun, and their next  step was to get the east and west line exactly at right angles.  This they  secured by stretching a rope north and south divided divided into three parts in  the proportion of 3, 4, and 5, (the Egyptian string trick again) fastening down  the centre part by pegs, and then swing round the loose ends toward the west  until they intersected and a right angled triangle was thus formed.  These  ancient temple builders, by means of the centre, formed the square, and the  centre was a point round which they could not err.  Here also is the  obvious answer to the question why it is customary at the erection of all  stately and superb edifices to lay the foundation stone at the north-east angle  of the building.      The question arises, have we anything in our present  ritual which might be relative in any way to this method of proving the square  or obtaining a right angle without the possibility of error and which may have  been connected with the instruction given in purely operative masonry.        The type of triangle most often used to demonstrate  the 47th problem in Masonry is not the 3 : 4: 5 but the 1: 1 : square root of 2  form.  The square and the cube which are 1 unit on each side are of great  symbolic meaning to Masons.  Therefore, the bisection of the square into a  pair of 1 : 1 : square root of 2 triangles has important Masonic connotations.   It is in this form that the Pythagorean theorem is most often visually  encountered in Masonry, specifically in the checkered floor and its tessellated  border, as a geometric proof on Lodge tracing boards, as the jewel of office for  a Past Master, and in the form of some Masonic aprons.        To create a 1:1 square root of 2 right triangle,  also known as an isosceles right triangle, you need a compass and a straight  edge -- familiar tools to the Craft, of course.  On soft ground, use the  compass to inscribe a circle.  Then use the straight edge to bisect the  circle through the center-point marked by the compass.  Mark the two points  where the bisecting line crosses the circle's circumference.  Using the  compass again, erect a perpendicular line that bisects this diameter-line  and mark the point where the perpendicular touches the circle.  Now connect  the three points you have marked -- and there is your 1 : 1 : square root of 2  right triangle.      To Freemasons, the first two points -- where you  marked the crossing of the bisecting diameter through the circle's circumference  -- can also be used to construct two further perpendicular lines.  These  are the two ""boundary"" lines of conduct sometimes symbolized on Masonic tracing  boards by the Two Saints John and sometimes referred to as indicators of the  Summer and Winter Solstices, whereon the feast days of those two saints occur.           We also have a fragment of great interest in the  ceremony of opening the Lodge in the Third Degree.  It is from the East and  towards the West that one's steps are directed to find that which was lost, and  it is with (by means of) the centre, that point round which a Master Mason  cannot err.  The opening catechism of the Third Degree fits so accurately  the process of forming a perfect square as used by the rope stretchers of  ancient Egypt that the belief forms in the mind that we have here a fragment of  the old operative instruction preserved in the mosaic of speculative Masonry.        No wonder that Pythagoras sacrificed an hecatomb!   No wonder that Anderson speaks of this proposition as the foundation of all  Masonry!  The only wonder is that modern Freemasonry has lost sight of the  importance of this symbol.      Our consideration of the subject has brought us back  again to the central point of modern Speculative Freemasonry--the knowledge of  God--to which all our symbolism points.  We seek it in the First Degree  under the symbolism of Light; we strive to attain it in the Second Degree as the  summit of all knowledge; we learn in the Third Degree that perfect knowledge is  not to be attained on this side of the grave; but everywhere it is taught as the  unifying bond of the Craft, cementing us as a common brotherhood with a common  Father, even God--that God who ever lives and loves, one God, one Law, one  element and one far-off divine event to which the whole creation moves.

Euclidean geometry  is a mathematical system attributed to the  Greek mathematician   Euclid  of  Alexandria .  Euclid's  Elements  is the earliest known systematic discussion of  geometry . It has been one of the most influential books in history, as much for its method as for its mathematical content. The method consists of assuming a small set of intuitively appealing  axioms , and then proving many other  propositions  ( theorems ) from those axioms. Although many of Euclid's results had been stated by earlier Greek mathematicians, Euclid was the first to show how these propositions could be fit together into a comprehensive deductive and  logical system .The  Elements  begin with  plane geometry , still taught in  secondary school  as the first  axiomatic system  and the first examples of  formal proof . It goes on to the  solid geometry  of three  dimensions . Much of the  Elements  states results of what is now called  number theory , proved using geometrical methods.   For over two thousand years, the adjective ""Euclidean"" was unnecessary because no other sort of geometry had been conceived. Euclid's axioms seemed so intuitively obvious that any theorem proved from them was deemed true in an absolute sense. Today, however, many other  self-consistent   non-Euclidean geometries  are known, the first ones having been discovered in the early 19th century. It also is no longer taken for granted that Euclidean geometry describes physical space. An implication of  Einstein 's theory of  general relativity  is that Euclidean geometry is a good approximation to the properties of physical space only if the  gravitational field  is not too strong.

Its superiority over earlier treatments was rapidly recognized, with the result that there was little interest in preserving the earlier ones, and they are now nearly all lost.   Books I-IV discuss plane geometry. Many results about plane figures are proved, e.g.,  If a triangle has two equal angles, then the sides subtended by the angles are equal.  The  Pythagorean theorem  is proved. [ 2 ]   Books V-X deal with number theory, with numbers treated geometrically via their representation as line segments with various lengths. Notions such as  prime numbers  and  rational  and  irrational  numbers are introduced. The infinitude of prime numbers is proved.   Books XI-XIII concern solid geometry. A typical result is the 1:3 ratio between the volume of a cone and a cylinder with the same height and base.     [ edit ]   Axiomatic treatment          A proof from Euclid's elements that, given a line segment, an equilateral triangle exists that includes the segment as one of its sides. The proof is by construction: an equilateral triangle  is made by drawing circles  and  centered on the points  and , and taking one intersection of the circles as the third vertex of the triangle.       Euclidean geometry is an  axiomatic system , in which all  theorems  (""true statements"") are derived from a small number of axioms. Near the beginning of the first book of the  Elements , Euclid gives five  postulates  (axioms) for plane geometry: [ 3 ]     Let the following be postulated: to draw a  straight line  from any  point  to any point.   To produce [extend] a  finite straight line  continuously in a straight line.   To describe a  circle  with any center and distance [radius].   That all right angles are equal to one another.   The  parallel postulate : That, if a straight line falling on two straight lines make the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which are the angles less than the two right angles.     The  Elements  also include the following five ""common notions"":     Things that equal the same thing also equal one another.   If equals are added to equals, then the wholes are equal.   If equals are subtracted from equals, then the remainders are equal.   Things that coincide with one another equal one another.   The whole is greater than the part.       [ edit ]   Constructive approach   Euclidean geometry is  constructive . Postulates 1, 2, 3, and 5 assert the existence and uniqueness of certain geometric figures, and these assertions are of a constructive nature: that is, we are not only told that certain things exist, but are also given methods for creating them with no more than a  compass and an unmarked straightedge . [ 4 ]  In this sense, Euclidean geometry is more concrete than many modern axiomatic systems such as  set theory , which often assert the existence of objects without saying how to construct them, or even assert the existence of objects that cannot be constructed within the theory. Strictly speaking, the lines on paper are  models  of the objects defined within the formal system, rather than instances of those objects. For example a Euclidean straight line has no width, but any real drawn line will. Although  nonconstructive methods  are today considered by nearly all mathematicians to be just as sound as constructive ones, Euclid's constructive proofs often supplanted fallacious nonconstructive ones, e.g., some of the Pythagoreans' proofs involving irrational numbers, which usually required a statement such as ""Find the greatest common measure of ..."" [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   The parallel postulate       Main article:  Parallel postulate              The parallel postulate: If two lines intersect a third in such a way that the sum of the inner angles on one side is less than two right angles, then the two lines inevitably must intersect each other on that side if extended far enough.       To the ancients, the parallel postulate seemed less obvious than the others. Euclid himself seems to have considered it as being qualitatively different from the others, as evidenced by the organization of the  Elements : the first 28 propositions he presents are those that can be proved without it.   Many alternative axioms can be formulated that have the same logical consequences as the parallel postulate. For example  Playfair's axiom  states:     Through a point not on a given straight line, at most one line can be drawn that never meets the given line.       [ edit ]   System of measurement and arithmetic   Euclidean geometry has two fundamental types of measurements: angle and distance. The angle scale is absolute, and Euclid uses the right angle as his basic unit, so that, e.g., a 45-degree angle would be referred to as half of a right angle. The distance scale is relative; one arbitrarily picks a line with a certain length as the unit, and other distances are expressed in relation to it.   A line in Euclidean geometry is a model of the  real number line . Addition is represented by a construction in which one line is copied onto the end of another line to extend its length, and similarly for subtraction.   Measurements of area and volume are derived from distances. For example, a rectangle with a width of 3 and a length of 4 has an area that represents the product, 12. Because this geometrical interpretation of multiplication was limited to three dimensions, there was no direct way of interpreting the product of four or more numbers, and Euclid avoided such products, although they are implied, e.g., in the proof of book IX, proposition 20.          An example of congruence. The two figures on the left are congruent, while the third is  similar  to them. The last figure is neither. Note that congruences alter some properties, such as location and orientation, but leave others unchanged, like  distance  and  angles . The latter sort of properties are called  invariants  and studying them is the essence of geometry.       Euclid refers to a pair of lines, or a pair of planar or solid figures, as ""equal"" () if their lengths, areas, or volumes are equal, and similarly for angles. The stronger term "" congruent "" refers to the idea that an entire figure is the same size and shape as another figure. Alternatively, two figures are congruent if one can be moved on top of the other so that it matches up with it exactly. (Flipping it over is allowed.) Thus, for example, a 2x6 rectangle and a 3x4 rectangle are equal but not congruent, and the letter R is congruent to its mirror image. Figures that would be congruent except for their differing sizes are referred to as  similar .     [ edit ]   Notation and terminology     [ edit ]   Naming of points and figures   Points are customarily named using capital letters of the alphabet. Other figures, such as lines, triangles, or circles, are named by listing a sufficient number of points to pick them out unambiguously from the relevant figure, e.g., triangle ABC would typically be a triangle with vertices at points A, B, and C.     [ edit ]   Complementary and supplementary angles   Angles whose sum is a right angle are called  complementary , those whose sum is two right angles  supplementary .     [ edit ]   Modern versions of Euclid's notation   In modern terminology, angles would normally be measured in  degrees  or  radians .   Modern school textbooks often define separate figures called  lines  (infinite),  rays  (semi-infinite), and  line segments  (of finite length). Euclid, rather than discussing a ray as an object that extends to infinity in one direction, would normally use locutions such as ""if the line is extended to a sufficient length,"" although he occasionally referred to ""infinite lines."" A ""line"" in Euclid could be either straight or curved, and he used the more specific term ""straight line"" when necessary.     [ edit ]   Some important or well known results                   The  bridge of asses  theorem states that A=B and C=D.                     The sum of angles A, B, and C is equal to 180 degrees.                     The Pythagorean theorem: The sum of the areas of the two squares on the legs ( a  and  b ) equals the area of the square on the hypotenuse ( c ).                     Thales' theorem: if AC is a diameter, then the angle at B is a right angle.               [ edit ]   The bridge of asses   The  bridge of asses  ( pons asinorum ) states that  In isosceles triangles the angles at the base equal one another, and, if the equal straight lines are produced further, then the angles under the base equal one another. [ 6 ]  Its name is attributed to its frequent role as the first real test in the Elements of the intelligence of the reader and as a bridge to the harder propositions that followed.          Congruence of triangles is determined by specifying two sides and the angle between them (SAS), two angles and the side between them (ASA) or two angles and a corresponding adjacent side (AAS). Specifying two sides and an adjacent angle (SSA), however, can yield two distinct possible triangles.         [ edit ]   Congruence of triangles   Triangles are congruent if they have all three sides equal (SSS), two sides and the angle between them (SAS), or two angles and a side (AAS) (Book I, propositions 4, 8, and 26). (Triangles with three equal angles are generally similar, but not necessarily congruent. Triangles with two equal sides and an adjacent angle are not necessarily equal.)     [ edit ]   Sum of the angles of a triangle   The sum of the angles of a triangle is equal to two right angles (180 degrees). [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   The Pythagorean theorem   The celebrated  Pythagorean theorem  (book I, proposition 47) states that in any right triangle, the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares whose sides are the two legs (the two sides that meet at a right angle).     [ edit ]   Thales' theorem   Thales' theorem (book I, proposition 32, named after  Thales of Miletus ) states that if A, B and C are points on a circle where the line AC is a diameter of the circle, then the angle ABC is a right angle. Tradition has it that Thales sacrificed an ox to celebrate this theorem. [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Infinitude of prime numbers   ""Prime numbers are more than any any assigned multitude of prime numbers,"" [ 9 ]  i.e., there are infinitely many prime numbers (book IX, proposition 20).     [ edit ]   Summation of geometrical series   For  , the sum of the partial  geometric series  is [ 10 ]           [ edit ]   Scaling of area and volume   In modern terminology, the area of a plane figure is proportional to the square of any of its linear dimensions,  , and the volume of a solid to the cube,  . Euclid proved these results in various special cases, e.g., for the area of a circle, [ 11 ]  and the volume of a parallelepipedal solid [ 12 ] . Euclid determined some, but not all, of the relevant constants of proportionality. E.g., it was his successor  Archimedes  who proved that a sphere has 2/3 the volume of the circumscribing cylinder. [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   Applications   Because of Euclidean geometry's fundamental status in mathematics, it would be impossible to give more than a representative sampling of applications here.                   A surveyor uses a  theodolite                     Sphere packing  applies to a stack of  oranges .                     A parabolic mirror brings parallel rays of light to a focus.             One of the earliest reasons for interest in geometry was  surveying , [ 14 ]  and certain practical results from Euclidean geometry, such as the right-angle property of the 3-4-5 triangle, were probably used long before they were proved formally. The fundamental types of measurements in Euclidean geometry are distances and angles, and both of these quantities can be measured directly by a surveyor. Historically, distances were often measured by chains such as  Gunter's chain , and angles using graduated circles and, later, the  theodolite .   An application of Euclidean solid geometry is the determination of packing arrangements, such as the problem of finding the most efficient  packing of spheres  in n dimensions. This problem has applications in  error detection and correction .   Geometric optics  uses Euclidean geometry to analyze the focusing of light by lenses and mirrors.                   Geometry is used in art and architecture.                     The water tower consists of a cone, a cylinder, and a hemisphere. Its volume can be calculated using solid geometry.                     Geometry can be used to design  origami .             Geometry is used extensively in architecture.   Geometry can be used to design  origami . Some  classical construction problems of geometry  are impossible using  compass and straightedge , but can be solved using origami. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Later work     [ edit ]   The 17th century: Descartes   Ren Descartes (1596-1650) developed  analytic geometry , an alternative method for formalizing geometry. [ 16 ]  In this approach, a point is represented by its  Cartesian  (x,y) coordinates, a line is represented by its equation, and so on. In Euclid's original approach, the  Pythagorean theorem  follows from Euclid's axioms. In the Cartesian approach, the axioms are the axioms of algebra, and the equation expressing the Pythagorean theorem is then a definition of one of the terms in Euclid's axioms, which are now considered to be theorems. The equation: defining the distance between two points  P  = ( p , q )  and  Q  = ( r , s )  is then known as the  Euclidean  metric , and other metrics define  non-Euclidean geometries .          Squaring the circle: the areas of this square and this circle are equal. In 1882, it was proven that this figure cannot be constructed in a finite number of steps with an idealized  compass and straightedge .       In terms of analytic geometry, the restriction of classical geometry to compass and straightedge constructions means a restriction to first- and second-order equations, e.g., y=2x+1 (a line), or x 2 +y 2 =7 (a circle).     [ edit ]   The 18th century   Geometers of the 18th century struggled to define the boundaries of the Euclidean system. Many tried in vain to prove the fifth postulate from the first four. By 1763 at least 28 different proofs had been published, but all were found to be incorrect. [ 17 ]   Leading up to this period, geometers also tried to determine what constructions could be accomplished in Euclidean geometry. For example, the problem of  trisecting an angle  with a compass and straightedge is one that naturally occurs within the theory, since the axioms refer to constructive operations that can be carried out with those tools. However, centuries of efforts failed to find a solution to this problem, until  Pierre Wantzel  published a proof in 1837 that such a construction was impossible. Other constructions proved to be impossible include  doubling the cube  and  squaring the circle . In the case of doubling the cube, the impossibility of the construction originates from the fact that the compass and straightedge method involve first- and second-order equations, while doubling a cube requires the solution of a third-order equation.   Euler  discussed a generalization of Euclidean geometry called  affine geometry , which retains the fifth postulate unmodified while weakening postulates three and four in a way that eliminates the notions of angle (whence right triangles become meaningless) and of equality of length of line segments in general (whence circles become meaningless) while retaining the notions of parallelism as an equivalence relation between lines, and equality of length of parallel line segments (so line segments continue to have a midpoint).     [ edit ]   The 19th century and noneuclidean geometry   Around 1830, the  Jnos Bolyai  and  Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky  separately published work on  noneuclidean geometry , in which the parallel postulate is not valid. [ 18 ]  Since noneuclidean geometry is provably self-consistent, the parallel postulate cannot be proved from the other postulates.   In the 19th century, it was also realized that Euclid's ten axioms and common notions do not suffice to prove all of theorems stated in the  Elements . For example, Euclid assumed implicitly that any line contains at least two points, but this assumption cannot be proved from the other axioms, and therefore needs to be an axiom itself. The very first geometric proof in the  Elements,  shown in the figure above, is that any line segment is part of a triangle; Euclid constructs this in the usual way, by drawing circles around both endpoints and taking their intersection as the third  vertex . His axioms, however, do not guarantee that the circles actually intersect, because they are consistent with discrete, rather than continuous, space. Starting with  Moritz Pasch  in 1882, many improved axiomatic systems for geometry have been proposed, the best known being those of  Hilbert , [ 19 ]   George Birkhoff , [ 20 ]  and  Tarski . [ 21 ]     [ edit ]   The 20th century and general relativity          A disproof of Euclidean geometry as a description of physical space. In a 1919 test of the general theory of relativity, stars (marked with short horizontal lines) were photographed during a solar  eclipse . The rays of starlight were bent by the Sun's gravity on their way to the earth. This is interpreted as evidence in favor of Einstein's prediction that gravity would cause deviations from Euclidean geometry.       Euclid believed that his axioms were self-evident statements about physical reality. Taken as a physical description of space, postulate 2 (extending a line) asserts that space does not have holes or boundaries (i.e., space is homogenous); postulate 3 (constructing a circle) asserts that space is infinite, [ 22 ]  since there is no limit on the radius of the circle; 4 (equality of right angles) says that space is homogeneous and isotropic, so that figures may be moved to any location while maintaining congruence; and 5 that space is flat. [ 23 ]   However,  Einstein's  theory of  general relativity  shows that the true geometry of spacetime is  non-Euclidean geometry . [ 24 ]  For example, if a triangle is constructed out of three rays of light, then in general the interior angles do not add up to 180 degrees due to gravity. A relatively weak gravitational field, such as the Earth's or the sun's, is represented by a metric that is approximately, but not exactly, Euclidean. Until the 20th century, there was no technology capable of detecting the deviations from Euclidean geometry, but Einstein predicted that such deviations would exist. They were later verified by observations such as the observation of the slight bending of starlight by the Sun during a solar eclipse in 1919, and  non-Euclidean geometry  is now, for example, an integral part of the software that runs the  GPS  system. [ 25 ]  It is possible to object to the non-Euclidean interpretation of general relativity on the grounds that light rays might be improper physical models of Euclid's lines, or that relativity could be rephrased so as to avoid the geometrical interpretations. However, one of the consequences of Einstein's theory is that there is no possible physical test that can do any better than a beam of light as a model of geometry. Thus, the only logical possibilities are to accept  non-Euclidean geometry  as physically real, or to reject the entire notion of physical tests of the axioms of geometry, which can then be imagined as a formal system without any intrinsic real-world meaning.     [ edit ]   Treatment of infinity     [ edit ]   Infinite objects   Euclid sometimes distinguished explicitly between ""finite lines"" (e.g., Postulate 2) and "" infinite  lines."" (book I, proposition 12) However, he typically did not make such distinctions unless they were necessary, and postulates 1, 3, and 4 are consistent with  elliptic geometry , in which there is a finite limit on the length of any line.   The notion of  infinitesimally small quantities  had previously been discussed extensively by the  Eleatic School , but nobody had been able to put them on a firm logical basis, with paradoxes such as  Zeno's paradox  occurring that had not been resolved to universal satisfaction. Euclid used the  method of exhaustion  rather than infinitesimals. [ 26 ]   Later ancient commentators such as  Proclus  (410-485 CE) treated many questions about infinity as issues demanding proof and, e.g., Proclus claimed to prove the infinite divisibility of a line, based on a proof by contradiction in which he considered the cases of even and odd numbers of points constituting it. [ 27 ]   At the turn of the 20th century,  Giuseppe Veronese  produced controversial work on  non-Archimedean  models of Euclidean geometry, in which the distance between two points may be infinite or infinitesimal, in the  Newton - Leibniz  sense. [ 28 ]  Fifty years later,  Abraham Robinson  provided a rigorous logical foundation for Veronese's work. [ 29 ]     [ edit ]   Infinite processes   One reason that the ancients treated the parallel postulate as less certain than the others is that verifying it physically would require us to inspect two lines to check that they never intersected, even at some very distant point, and this inspection could potentially take an infinite amount of time. [ 30 ]   The modern formulation of  proof by induction  was not developed until the 17th century, but later commentators consider it to be implicit in some of Euclid's proofs, e.g., the proof of the infinitude of primes. [ 31 ]     [ edit ]   Logical basis   Euclid frequently used the method of  proof by contradiction , and therefore the traditional presentation of Euclidean geometry assumes  classical logic , in which every proposition is either true or false, i.e., for any proposition P, the proposition ""P or not P"" is automatically true.   Tarski  (1902-1983) and his students demonstrated for the first time that Euclidean geometry can be expressed as a  first-order theory . That is, it can be written entirely in a form that allows statements such as ""for all triangles ..."", without those like ""for all  sets  of triangles ..."" This is important because it shows that the subject does not depend on  set theory  for its logical basis. Tarski proved his  axiomatic formulation  of Euclidean geometry to be complete in a certain  sense : there is an algorithm which, for every proposition, can show it to be either true or false. [ 32 ]  (This does not not violate  Gdel's theorem , because Euclidean geometry cannot describe a sufficient amount of  arithmetic  for the theorem to apply.
