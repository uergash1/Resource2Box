Howard 's films are pure entertainment; they are well-crafted efforts, frequently technically challenging from a production standpoint, and aimed at mainstream audiences. Though some of his lesser works have been criticized for possessing formulaic scripts,  Howard 's films approach even hackneyed subjects in fresh ways. Though he does not characterize himself as a risk taker, he loves the challenge of exploring different genres; therefore, his filmography includes B-movie actioners, domestic comedies, fantasies, sci-fi, suspense-thrillers, historical dramas, and big-budget action films.     The son of actors Rance and  Jean Howard , he made his theatrical debut at age two in a Baltimore production of The Seven Year Itch. He made his screen debut at age five in the suspenseful political drama The Journey (1959). The youngster became a hot property after that and appeared in several features, including The Music Man and  The Courtship of Eddie's Father  (both 1962). Through this period his father was a strong ally who kept  Howard  from being exploited by filmmakers. In a November 1996 interview with the Detroit News,  Howard  describes an incident in which he was six years old and during rehearsal could not cry on cue ( Howard  doesn't name the production), causing the director to threaten to flog him. Other children may have been terrified, but  Howard  felt secure because his father was on the set and would protect him. When producer  Sheldon Leonard  approached Rance Howard about casting Ronny (as he was billed during childhood) as Opie, the son of widowed sheriff Andy Taylor in The Andy Griffith Show (1960-1968), the elder  Howard  stipulated that his son be allowed time off for a normal childhood. It was as the mischievous but guileless Opie that Ronny Howard became famous. During the popular show's long run,  Howard  occasionally appeared in other feature films.     While a series' demise often signals the death of a child actor's career, particularly if that child is obviously maturing,  Howard  managed the transition gracefully and continued working steadily. He was cast in a new television series,  The Smith Family , in 1971 and starred opposite  Henry Fonda , who became one of  Howard 's mentors, encouraging  Howard  to strive for creative growth and to take periodic risks to keep himself vital. The series lasted one season, but again  Howard  landed on his feet, making a bigger name for himself starring as a callow youth in  George Lucas ' smash hit  American Graffiti  (1973). The film spawned Garry Marshall's long-running hit, the '50s revival sitcom Happy Days (1974). Essentially reprising his role from the film,  Howard  (now billed as Ron Howard) starred as all-American youth Richie Cunningham. Again,  Howard  also worked simultaneously in films, notably in  The Shootist  (1976), where he played a teen who worshipped dying gunslinger  John Wayne .     Though playing a teenager on the series,  Howard  was in his early twenties and felt it was time to follow his longtime dream of becoming a director. Producer  Roger Corman , who had recently starred  Howard  in  Eat My Dust!  (1976), let  Howard  helm the similarly themed  Grand Theft Auto  (1977).  Howard  also co-wrote the screenplay with his father and starred in the film. While not exactly an original masterpiece, the film earned praise for its fast-paced, high-energy action scenes. After leaving Happy Days in 1980, he directed  Bette Davis  in a television movie, Skyward, and managed to earn the great lady's respect with his filmmaking skills.  Howard  had his first big hit in 1982 with the black comedy Nightshift. It was to be the first of many instances in which he would work with producer  Brian Grazer , who eventually became his partner and the co-founder of  Howard 's production company, Imagine Films Entertainment (established in 1985), and screenwriters  Lowell Ganz  and  Babaloo Mandel , who formerly wrote for Happy Days.     Howard  had even greater success with the  Tom Hanks / Darryl Hannah  vehicle  Splash  (1984), which launched Disney's Touchstone Pictures and became the company's most successful live-action film to date. He followed this up with sentimental favorite  Cocoon  (1985). Earlier that year  Howard  starred in an immensely popular television reunion movie, Back to Mayberry. He had his first misstep after hitting it big with Willow, a  George Lucas -produced fantasy extravaganza that never clicked with audiences, though it has since developed a devoted cult following. During the early '90s,  Howard  went into a slump when a series of big-budget films such as  Backdraft  (1991) and  Far and Away  (1992) did relatively poorly with critics and viewers, but came back strongly with  Apollo 13  (1995), a gripping account of a failed moon mission. A masterful blend of special effects wizardry (it contains the most realistic views of weightlessness on film), science, and human interest,  Apollo 13  was a huge international hit, nominated for nine Oscars (it won for Best Sound and Best Editing), and earned  Howard  the coveted Director's Guild Association Outstanding Feature Film Directorial Achievement Award, which puts him in league with such directors as  John Ford ,  Billy Wilder ,  George Cukor , and  Francis Ford Coppola .     In 1996,  Howard  attempted a new genre with the violent, bloody thriller  Ransom , starring  Mel Gibson . While an effective suspense thriller in it's own right,  Ransom  didn't darken  Howard 's sensibilities in any permanent terms, and after a few stints as producer on both the small screen (Felicity, Sports Night and the silver screen (Inventing the Abbots (1997) and Beyond the Mat (1999)),  Howard  was back in the director's chair for Ed TV in 1999. Though it was warmly recieved by critics and gained generally positive notice from those who saw it, Ed TV suffered immediate and fatal comparisons to the more popular and strikingly similar Jim Carrey vehicle, The Truman Show. Undaunted,  Howard  next teamed with the rubber-faced star of Truman for an imaginative and visually dazzling live-action adaptation of Theodore Geisel's animated Christmas classic How the Grinch Stole Christmas. With it's elaborate sets and costumes, as well as Carrey's giddy performance as the grumpy green Grinch, many found the film an overblown expansion of the beloved children's classic (though many were quick to single-out Carrey's energetic portrayal of the Grinch as a entertainingly distracting highlight).   Once again turning back to reality after the marked departure of The Grinch,  Howard  helmed the sensitive real-life tale of paranoid schizophrenic mathematician turned Nobel Prize winnig genius John Forbes Nash Jr. in A Beautiful Mind (2001). With Russel Crowe essaying the role of Nash and  Jennifer Connelly  as his faithful and enduring wife, the film gained generally positive reception upon release, and only seemed to cement  Howard 's reputation as one of the most versatile and gifted director's of his generation as the filmt took the Best Picture award at both the that year's Golden Globes and Oscars. Academy Award night proved to be an even bigger night for  Howard  as the film also took home awards for Best Actress, Best Adapted Screenplay and, of course, Best Director.     Howard  followed up his Oscar wins with the dark Western drama The Missing starring Tommy Lee Jones and Cate Blanchett. Unfortunately, neither critics or audiences were too fond of the over-long film. Lucky for  Howard , his next project would see him re-team with A Beautiful Mind's Russell Crowe. The Depression-era boxing film Cinderella Man starred Crowe as real-life boxer Jim Braddock and was released in 2005 to positive reviews and Oscar-buzz.    When not working,  Howard  spends time at his Connecticut home with his wife, former high school sweetheart Cheryl, and their four children -- three of whom were named after the places in which they were conceived. Neither he nor his wife will permit the kids to become actors until they are fully grown. ~ Sandra Brennan, All Movie Guide                                                                                                         Movie data provided by                                                                                            © 2007 Getty Images                                                     Add this Person to Favorites                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Need Help?

The recently-orphaned Mary Lennox travels from her home in  India  to her uncle Archibald Craven's hundred-room house, Misselthwaite Manor, in  Yorkshire ,  England . Mary, materially spoiled but emotionally neglected by her late parents, is rather unpleasant and unhappy in her new surroundings. Martha, a Yorkshire girl working as a maid, and her brother  Dickon Sowerby , a boy who can talk to animals, befriend and help her to heal and grow. She discovers her deceased aunt's secret garden, which has been locked for ten years and enlists Dickon to help her bring it to life.   Hidden away in the gloomy house is Mary's cousin Colin, who has been treated all his life like a fragile, sickly invalid. This exaggeration has augmented what smaller problems he did have, turning him into a demanding, short-tempered, helpless boy. Mary, defying the orders of Mrs Medlock (who runs Misselthwaite), discovers Colin and is taken aback by his disposition, but reaches out to him anyway. Soon Colin, Mary, and Dickon all spend their time in the secret garden. They perform ""magic""; barefoot, they make a large bonfire and play a flute, dance round it, and chant, while Colin asks the magic to send his father. Colin learns to walk and gets quite well, which his father Archibald discovers upon his return to Misselthwaite.     [ edit ]   Differences between film and book   A number of minor changes were made in adapting the story for the screen, though the major plot points and character qualities remain, resulting in a considerably faithful retelling. Following is a list of some of the differences:     In the book, Mary's parents die of cholera epidemic; in the film, an earthquake and the resulting mayhem (a charging elephant and a fire at a large party) lead to their deaths.   In the book, Mary is blonde, plain and sallow; in the film, she has brown hair and appears to be considerably healthier and pretty rather than plain.   In the book, Archibald Craven's wife is Mary's aunt through her father. In the movie, his wife was twin sister to Mary's mother.   In the book, Mary discovers the key to the locked garden rather by accident after a robin digs it up. In the movie, she finds it in her aunt's room and initially doesn't know what it is for, but remembers it when finding the door to the garden.   In the book, Mary finds the door to the garden when the wind blows back the ivy covering it. In the movie, a robin leads her to the area where the door is before the wind blows away the ivy.   Mrs. Medlock of this film is a much more stern character than her counterpart in the book.   In the book, Martha and Dickon's mother, Susan Sowerby, writes to Archibald and requests that he should go home to the children. This is after he has had the dream which is partly interpreted in the film, of his wife saying she is in the garden. However, in the film, he has the dream because of the influence of Colin's magic in wanting him home, and Susan Sowerby has nothing to do with it.   A romantic attraction between Mary and Dickon, and Colin towards Mary, is hinted at in the film, but is not evident in the book.   In the movie, Mary's wardrobe is black, whereas in the book her new wardrobe is colorful because Mr. Craven despises black.   In the book Dickon has red hair, but in the film, he has dark brown hair.   In the book, Archibald Craven's wife Lilias fell out of a tree when the branch snapped, and died from the fall, and the tiring incident of Colin's birth. In the film, she fell off the swing, and the pre-mentioned events then followed.   In the book, Colin Craven has his mother's grey eyes, and Mary resembles her by her hair, and other features. However, in the film, Lord Craven suggests that it is Mary who has her aunt's eyes, and Colin says he looks nothing like his mother.   The pictures of Lord Craven and his pregnant wife on the swing never existed in the book.   In the film, Mary's aunt and mother, being twin sisters, which is not true in the book, have similar things. Mary mentions a similar dressing table. And also, the ivory elephant of her mother's which Mary breaks in her anger before the earthquake (also not true in the book) has a twin which sits on that very dressing table in her aunt's room. However, in the book, Mary never visits her aunts room, and sees the ivory elephants in what she calls an Indian room, while wandering about when she first comes to Misselthwaite.

Howard came to prominence in the 1960s while playing  Andy Griffith 's TV son,  Opie Taylor , on  The Andy Griffith Show  (credited as Ronny Howard), and later in the 1970s as Howard Cunningham's son and  Arthur Fonzarelli 's best friend,  Richie Cunningham , on  Happy Days  (a role he played from 1974 to 1980). Since retiring from acting, he has directed many films including  Apollo 13 ,  A Beautiful Mind ,  Frost/Nixon ,  The Da Vinci Code , and its upcoming sequel,  Angels and Demons .

[ 1 ]  His family later moved to  Burbank, California , just the year before his parents gave birth to his younger brother,  Clint Howard . Howard graduated from  John Burroughs High School , and later attended the  University of Southern California 's  School of Cinematic Arts  but did not graduate. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Career     [ edit ]   Early acting roles and  The Andy Griffith Show   Howard first earned recognition for playing Winthrop Paroo, the child with the lisp in the film version of  The Music Man  with  Robert Preston  and  Shirley Jones . Besides appearing in  The Music Man , he appeared in the role of  Opie Taylor  in the television series  The Andy Griffith Show , which was the successful spin-off of  The Danny Thomas Show . There he portrayed the son of the local sheriff in the fictional town of  Mayberry ,  North Carolina . For eight seasons, he created a loving relationship with  Andy Griffith  on-screen, and spent a lot of time with him off-screen when not filming. The credits referred to him as ""Ronny Howard."" He also appeared in the 1963 film  The Courtship of Eddie's Father  with  Glenn Ford  and (billed as ""Ronnie Howard"") in  Little Boy Lost , a 1963 episode of the  NBC   medical drama   The Eleventh Hour  as the character Barry Stewart in the episode entitled ""Is Mr. Martian Coming Back?"", and a 1966 episode of the NBC  adventure  series  I Spy  with  Robert Culp  and  Bill Cosby .   Howard made a notable guest-star appearance on the popular television series  M*A*S*H  during that show's first season as an  underage  American serving in  the Marines  during the  Korean War . In  1976 , Howard was offered the role of Gillom Rogers in the movie  The Shootist , starring opposite Hollywood legend  John Wayne . At the time, Howard had no idea that this would be the last pairing of the two, as Wayne would die three years later of cancer; in fact, Howard is often quoted as saying: "" About a couple of months after filming wrapped on The Shootist, Duke called me up and said, 'I found a good script, kid . . . it's you and me, or it's nobody.' "" As a token of respect, during the beginning of "" The Shootist ,"" Howard lent his voice to the beginning montage, which shows Wayne in various clips from his career.     [ edit ]   American Graffiti  and  Happy Days   Howard played Steve Bollander in  George Lucas '  teen movie   American Graffiti  in 1973. The role led to him being cast as Richie Cunningham in the TV series  Happy Days  on which, beginning in 1974, he played the likeable ""buttoned-down"" boy, in contrast to  Henry Winkler 's "" greaser ""  Arthur ""Fonzie"" Fonzarelli . In 1977, while still starring on  Happy Days , he directed his first film, a  low-budget   comedy / action film  called  Grand Theft Auto .   His last significant on-screen role was when he reprised his famous role as Opie Taylor in the 1986 TV reunion movie  Return to Mayberry  reuniting him with  Andy Griffith ,  Don Knotts , and most of the old cast.     [ edit ]   Directing   Before leaving  Happy Days  in 1980, Howard made his directing debut with the 1977 project  Grand Theft Auto  (after cutting a deal with  Roger Corman  to star in  Eat My Dust  with  Christopher Norris ). Howard went on to direct several TV movies. His big theatrical break came in 1982 with  Night Shift  featuring soon-to-be stars, such as  Michael Keaton  and  Shelley Long , as well as reuniting Howard with  Happy Days  co-star  Henry Winkler .   He has since directed a number of high-visibility films, including  Splash ,  Parenthood ,  Cocoon ,  Apollo 13  (nominated for nine  Academy Awards  and winning two),  A Beautiful Mind  (for which he won the  Academy Award for Best Director ),  Cinderella Man  and  The Da Vinci Code .   Howard's younger brother,  Clint , has minor roles in most of his movies.   Howard showcased the world premiere of his newest film  Frost/Nixon  at the 2008 London Film Festival in October 2008. [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Imagine Entertainment   Howard is the co-chairman, with  Brian Grazer , of  Imagine Entertainment , a major film and television production company, which has produced notable projects like  Friday Night Lights ,  8 Mile ,  Inside Deep Throat , and the television series  24  and  Felicity .   Through his company  Imagine Television , Howard continues to have a presence in television, most recently as the executive producer and uncredited  narrator  of the critically acclaimed  FOX  sitcom  Arrested Development . The show, despite having won six Emmy awards and near-unanimous praise from critics, did not enjoy high  ratings  and was limited by  Fox Television  in 2006 due to FOX scheduling the show opposite major events on other stations. A series finale took place in February 2006, but Howard, on-screen for the first time in the show, suggested a movie version may be in the works. In February 2008,  Jeffrey Tambor  and  Jason Bateman  confirmed that a movie is, in fact, going to be made with a possible 2009 release. Creator  Mitchell Hurwitz  is writing the screenplay, while Howard will direct. [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Personal life   On June 7, 1975, Howard wed his high-school sweetheart, Cheryl ( ne  Alley), a writer with a degree in geriatric psychology. They have four children; daughters  Bryce Dallas Howard  (b. 1981), Jocelyn Carlyle and Paige Carlyle (twins, b. 1985), and son Reed Cross (b. 1987). His daughters' middle names indicate where they were conceived, Bryce in Dallas, twins Jocelyn and Paige at the Hotel Carlyle in New York City. Son Reed Cross was named after a London street because ""Volvo isn't a very good middle name"", according to Howard. [ 5 ]  Daughters Bryce and Paige are actresses. The family lives on a 35-acre (140,000 m 2 ) estate in the exclusive gated community of  Conyers Farm  in  Greenwich, Connecticut . In February 2007, Howard became a grandfather when his daughter, Bryce, gave birth to a son, Theodore Norman Howard Gabel.   Howard was the sixth cousin to his  Andy Griffith Show  co-star,  Don Knotts , through Howard's ancestor, Lucinda Knotts.   In the June 2006 issue of  Vanity Fair  magazine, Ron Howard was asked, ""What do you consider your greatest achievement?"" He replied, ""Forty-eight consecutive years of steady employment in television and film, while preserving a rich family life.""     [ edit ]   Howard in popular culture   Howard appeared as himself twice in  The Simpsons . In "" When You Dish Upon a Star "",  Homer  meets and befriends  Alec Baldwin ,  Kim Basinger  and Howard. Later in the episode, Howard is injured when trying to jump from a truck to the RV that Homer was driving. In the end, he pitches Homer's movie idea and gets it greenlit. Another episode ("" Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder "") Homer and Howard are fighting each other while appearing on  The Springfield Squares . Later, Howard gives Homer the inspiration to spend more time with his kids and gives him some money that Homer refuses but takes anyway. Ron yoinks the money back from Homer and then drives away.   In the  Family Guy  episode "" You May Now Kiss the...Uh...Guy Who Receives ,"" Stewie humorously threatens Ron's life, saying that he'll be in the Oscars in the section honoring those who died.   When he hosted  Saturday Night Live  in the 1980s,  Eddie Murphy  called him ""Opie Cunningham"". In the  South Park  episode, "" Ginger Kids "",  Cartman  asks a crowd of fellow gingers to name great Americans with red hair, the first and only name they can think of is ""Ron Howard"", and when asked to name a second, one responds ""Ron Howard"" again.   On a  VH1  special about the 100 greatest  Child Stars , many of the interviewees considered Ron Howard to be the most successful child star of all-time, considering his two major television acting roles and his directing career. [ citation needed ]  In Season 1, Episode 3 of  Stroker and Hoop  on  Adult Swim , Stroker and Hoop ran a detective agency whose first client needed them to make Ron Howard stop controlling his mind.   In October 2008, Howard reprised his roles as Opie Taylor and Richie Cunningham for the first time in over 20 years when he appeared in a video on  funnyordie.com  in which he endorsed Barack Obama and urged people to vote. The video, titled  ""Ron Howards Call to Action"" , [ 6 ] also features  Andy Griffith  and  Henry Winkler . As seen in the video, Howard is seen shaving his beard and having hair done to recreate his younger look.   Ron Howard recently made a cameo appearance in the 2009 music video for fellow Academy Award winner Jamie Foxx's song ""Blame It"" along side Academy Award winner Forrest Whittaker, Academy Award nominee, Jake Gyllenhaal and Samuel L. Jackson. In the video he is shown holding a glass of champagne.

The recently-orphaned Mary Lennox travels from her home in  India  to her uncle Archibald Craven's hundred-room house, Misselthwaite Manor, in  Yorkshire ,  England . Mary, materially spoiled but emotionally neglected by her late parents, is rather unpleasant and unhappy in her new surroundings. Martha, a Yorkshire girl working as a maid, and her brother  Dickon Sowerby , a boy who can talk to animals, befriend and help her to heal and grow. She discovers her deceased aunt's secret garden, which has been locked for ten years and enlists Dickon to help her bring it to life.   Hidden away in the gloomy house is Mary's cousin Colin, who has been treated all his life like a fragile, sickly invalid. This exaggeration has augmented what smaller problems he did have, turning him into a demanding, short-tempered, helpless boy. Mary, defying the orders of Mrs Medlock (who runs Misselthwaite), discovers Colin and is taken aback by his disposition, but reaches out to him anyway. Soon Colin, Mary, and Dickon all spend their time in the secret garden. They perform ""magic""; barefoot, they make a large bonfire and play a flute, dance round it, and chant, while Colin asks the magic to send his father. Colin learns to walk and gets quite well, which his father Archibald discovers upon his return to Misselthwaite.     [ edit ]   Soundtrack   The film features an end credits song, Winter Light, performed by  Linda Ronstadt , based on two themes from the score by  Zbigniew Preisner . However, the song is not featured in the film's original soundtrack, but in Ronstadt's eponymous album  Winter Light .   The soundtrack, released by  Varese Sarabande , contains the original score.     [ edit ]   Differences between film and book   A number of minor changes were made in adapting the story for the screen, though the major plot points and character qualities remain, resulting in a considerably faithful retelling. Following is a list of some of the differences:     In the book, Mary's parents die of cholera epidemic; in the film, an earthquake and the resulting mayhem (a charging elephant and a fire at a large party) lead to their deaths.   In the book, Mary is blonde, plain and sallow; in the film, she has brown hair and appears to be considerably healthier and pretty rather than plain.   In the book, Archibald Craven's wife is Mary's aunt through her father. In the movie, his wife was twin sister to Mary's mother.   In the book, Mary discovers the key to the locked garden rather by accident after a robin digs it up. In the movie, she finds it in her aunt's room and initially doesn't know what it is for, but remembers it when finding the door to the garden.   In the book, Mary finds the door to the garden when the wind blows back the ivy covering it. In the movie, a robin leads her to the area where the door is before the wind blows away the ivy.   Mrs. Medlock of this film is a much more stern character than her counterpart in the book.   In the book, Martha and Dickon's mother, Susan Sowerby, writes to Archibald and requests that he should go home to the children. This is after he has had the dream which is partly interpreted in the film, of his wife saying she is in the garden. However, in the film, he has the dream because of the influence of Colin's magic in wanting him home, and Susan Sowerby has nothing to do with it.   A romantic attraction between Mary and Dickon, and Colin towards Mary, is hinted at in the film, but is not evident in the book.   In the movie, Mary's wardrobe is black, whereas in the book her new wardrobe is colorful because Mr. Craven despises black.   In the book Dickon has red hair, but in the film, he has dark brown hair.   In the book, Archibald Craven's wife Lilias fell out of a tree when the branch snapped, and died from the fall, and the tiring incident of Colin's birth. In the film, she fell off the swing, and the pre-mentioned events then followed.   In the book, Colin Craven has his mother's grey eyes, and Mary resembles her by her hair, and other features. However, in the film, Lord Craven suggests that it is Mary who has her aunt's eyes, and Colin says he looks nothing like his mother.   The pictures of Lord Craven and his pregnant wife on the swing never existed in the book.   In the film, Mary's aunt and mother, being twin sisters, which is not true in the book, have similar things. Mary mentions a similar dressing table. And also, the ivory elephant of her mother's which Mary breaks in her anger before the earthquake (also not true in the book) has a twin which sits on that very dressing table in her aunt's room. However, in the book, Mary never visits her aunts room, and sees the ivory elephants in what she calls an Indian room, while wandering about when she first comes to Misselthwaite.       [ edit ]   Response     [ edit ]   Critical Reception   Since its 1993 release, the film has garnered exceptionally positive reviews and currently garners a rare 100% ""fresh"" approval rating on the  Rotten Tomatoes  website.

I absolutely loved this film when I was younger, and it's still in my video collection.  Based around a girl called Mary Lennox, who after growing up in India with her parents and losing them in an earthquake, is sent to live with her reclusive uncle in England. After a brief meeting with her Uncle, who is still mourning the loss of his wife 10 years previous, Mary is left to her own accord to wander the gardens and do as she pleases. She finds a key and the most magical secret garden, and with the help of a friendly robin and one of the servants brothers, Dickon, they restore it and learn the secrets of the manor along the way.  It's a great film, and Kate Maberly plays Mary brilliantly, starting off as a bitter selfish girl, who hasn't ever dressed herself, to a young girl capable of loving once again. It's a great family, feel good film, set in the English countryside! emza2511's review and ratings    | 179 words                                         Del.icio.us   Furl   Magnolia   My Yahoo   Digg   Google   StumbleUpon   Facebook Tell a Friend   The Secret Garden Web Sites       Who Wrote the Secret Garden When Was the Secret Garden Written Secret Garden Book Summary of the Secret Garden Characters in Secret Garden Secret Garden Lyrics Secret Garden Movie Film Location for the Secret Garden Author of Secret Garden The Secret Garden Leyburn A Biography of Frances Hodgson Burnett Kate Maberly Now Lepidocybium Forbidden Corner MRs Henry Wood Amazon Ergot Fungus Latin Phrases Arctocephalinae Interflora Frances Hodgson Burnett Tom Jones         Search for:        this topic             Top Childrens Films Bedknobs And Broomsticks Cool Runnings Finding Nemo (U) Goodnight Mister Tom Holes The Incredibles (U) Who Framed Roger Rabbit (Special Edition) Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory Winnie The Pooh - The Many Adventures Of Winnie The Pooh Wizard Of Oz (U) Requested reviews 100 Favourite Nursery Rhymes And Songs Basil The Great Mouse Detective Cinderella Special Edition Hercules Jungle Book 2 (U) Pollyanna Stingray - Complete Series The Hunchback Of Notre Dame The Rescuers Down Under Treasure Planet   Would you like to see a review that's not being listed?

Learn how to watch your favorite TV shows and movies online for free!     The cost of entertainment can be expensive. Luckily, there are websites that allow users to watch TV shows and movies at no cost from your own computer. With no cost to you and just a few minutes of brief advertisements, you can catch up on missed episodes of your favorite shows, relive old memories with television classics and even watch a blockbuster or two.   Online Television    Watching television and movies online is not only free--it is also legal. According to Gregory Karp of the Chicago Tribune in his article  ""Watching TV Solely on Computers is Possible,""  ""Full-length TV shows are available on the Internet, supported by short commercials"" [January 5, 2009].   Online movies and television is available through many websites including:   Television Networks : Find your favorite show's website and they might just have a free episode or two online. Aggregated Websites : A collection of TV shows and older movies sponsored by advertisers. You get the shows for free, but interspersed with ads for products. Some of these websites include:  Hulu.com  and Joost.com. Freebies on Pay Sites:  Many websites offer TV shows and movies for download such as Netflix and Itunes, but sometimes, sites, such as Itunes, offer free or low cost previews, clips or even entire shows Youtube:  Youtube.com and other sites like it offer free clips and samples of movie trailers and shows. Playing TV and Movies on Your Computer   Once you have found a TV show or movie you want to watch you can view it on your computer through your computers media player. If you do not have the necessary software installed on your computer, don't worry! The website will usually direct you to a page where you can download the correct plug-in or software to play media on the Internet.   Pros and Cons of Free TV and Movies Online   Viewing free TV shows and movies online legally on your computer seems like a great alternative to paying for cable or downloading shows from paid sites. But, before you cancel that cable subscription package there are some pros and cons to consider:   Pros   Convenience: You can view the shows you want when you want. Streamline Viewing: Access only the TV shows and movies you are interested in viewing and leave the rest. Don't Miss Out: You can rewind, pause and restart as much as you need to - unlike watching a show on cable. It is free and legal: If you had been tempted to download a show through other means - these options might just change your mind! Cons   Online isn't everything: Not everything can be found online. Also, as Karp notes in his Tribune article, there are often delays with networks loading shows onto the air or even deleting shows from their servers. You may not be able to enjoy a show again and again. If you didn't get to finish watching it and it was removed from the server - you can't catch the rerun! Picture and sound quality: Unless you've done a lot of tweaking to set your computer up only to watch free online TV shows and movies your computer is also doing a lot of other things besides buffering your shows! Slowdowns, delays, sound quality and the like may all interfere with the viewing experience. Watching TV Shows and Movies Online is Here to Stay   Even with the cons of online television and movie viewing - new ways to legally access free shows are created everyday! It may be worth a couple of days delay and a few sound bite issues to see episodes of your favorite TV shows and old movies. At no cost to you - why not ""see"" what all the fuss is about?

IMDb       On the Waterfront  is a  1954   American   drama film  about mob violence and corruption among  longshoremen . The film was directed by  Elia Kazan  and written by  Budd Schulberg . It stars  Marlon Brando ,  Eva Marie Saint ,  Rod Steiger ,  Karl Malden  and  Lee J. Cobb . The soundtrack score was composed by  Leonard Bernstein . It was based on a series of articles written in the  New York Sun  by  Malcolm Johnson .   The film received eight  Academy Awards , including  Best Picture ,  Best Actor , and  Best Director . It is  Leonard Bernstein 's only original film score not adapted from a stage production with musical songs.   On the Waterfront  has often been cited as an allegory of ""naming names"" against suspected Communists during the anti-Communist investigations of the 1950s.

This classic story of Mob informers was based on a number of true stories and filmed on location in and around the docks of  Hoboken ,  New Jersey . Mob-connected union boss Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb) rules the waterfront with an iron fist. The police know that he's been responsible for a number of murders, but witnesses play deaf and dumb (""D&D""). Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando) is a dockworker whose brother Charley (Rod Steiger) is Friendlys lawyer. Some years earlier, Terry had been a promising boxer until Friendly had Charley instruct Terry to deliberately lose a fight that he could have won, so that Friendly could win money betting on the weaker opponent. As the film begins, Terry sees boss Friendly's men kill another dockworker to keep him from testifying against Friendly before the crime commission, and Terry resents having been tricked into helping to set up the murder. At first Terry is willing to remain D&D. The dead dockworker's lovely sister, Edie (Eva Marie Saint) shames ""waterfront priest"" Father Barry (Karl Malden) into fighting against the union/mob. Soon both Edie and Father Barry are urging Terry to testify. Another dockworker does testify, and Friendly arranges for him to have a fatal accident.   As Terry increasingly leans toward testifying, Friendly decides that Terry must be killed unless Charley can bribe, or threaten, him to keep quiet. Charley tries, but fails. In one of the most famous scenes in movie history, Terry reminds Charley that if it had not been for the fixing of the fight, ""I coulda been a contender"". Charley gives Terry a gun and tells him to run. Friendly finds out, and has his goons murder Charley, and try to kill Terry. Terry tries to find, and shoot, Friendly, but Father Barry obstructs that course of action and finally convinces Terry to fight Friendly by testifying. In a final face-to-face confrontation with Friendly, Terry gets beaten up, but the dockworkers fall in behind Terry, sensing that he has defeated Friendly.     [ edit ]   Factual background   On the Waterfront  was based on a 24-part series of articles in the  New York Sun  by  Malcolm Johnson , ""Crime on the Waterfront"". The series won the 1949  Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting . The stories detailed widespread  corruption, extortion, and racketeering  on the waterfront of Manhattan and Brooklyn.   To add realism,  On the Waterfront  was filmed over 36 days on-location in  Hoboken, New Jersey  (in the cargo holds of ships, workers' slum dwellings, the bars, the littered alleys, and on the rooftops). And some of the labor boss' chief bodyguards/goons in the film (Abe Simon as Barney, Tony Galento as Truck, and Tami Mauriello as Tullio) were real-life, professional ex-heavyweight boxers.          Marlon Brando as Terry Malloy and Eva Marie Saint as Edie Doyle in the film's trailer.       In  On the Waterfront , protagonist Terry Malloy's (Brando's) fight against corruption was in part modeled after whistle-blowing longshoreman Anthony DiVincenzo, who testified before a real-life  Waterfront Commission  on the facts of life on the Hoboken docks and had suffered a degree of ostracism for his deed. DiVincenzo sued and settled, many years after, with  Columbia Pictures  over the appropriation of what he considered his story. DiVincenzo recounted his story to screenwiter  Budd Schulberg  during a month-long session of waterfront barroom meetings  which some claim never occurred  even though Shulberg attended Di Vincenzo's waterfront commission testimony every day during the hearing. Johnny Friendly was based in part on mobster  Albert Anastasia , chief executioner of  Murder, Inc.  as well as  Michael Clemente , the  International Longshoremen's Association  boss. [ citation needed ]   Karl Malden's character of Father Barry was based on the real-life ""waterfront priest"" Father  John M. Corridan , a graduate of  Regis High School  who operated a  Roman Catholic  labor school on the  west side of Manhattan . Father Corridan was extensively interviewed by Budd Schulberg, who wrote the foreword to a biography of Father Corridan,  Waterfront Priest  by Allen Raymond. The story was filmed in Hoboken, New Jersey, although it is a fictionalized version of events on the New York waterfront.     [ edit ]   Schulberg's later novel   Budd Schulberg later published a novel just called  Waterfront  that was much closer to his original screenplay than what finally ended up on the screen. Among several differences is that in Schulberg's novel and original screen treatment, Terry Malloy dies.     [ edit ]   Political context          Karl Malden as Father Barry with Eva Marie Saint.       In 1952, director Elia Kazan was a ""friendly"" witness before the  House Un-American Activities Committee  (HUAC), in which he identified many alleged Communists in the film industry. That brought him severe criticism. [ 1 ]  Being ""friendly"" before the HUAC could be a possible clue towards the name of the mob boss in the movie, Johnny Friendly.   The original screenplay (called ""The Hook"") was written by renowned playwright  Arthur Miller , who was blacklisted as an alleged Communist. He was replaced by  Budd Schulberg , also a ""friendly"" witness before HUAC. [ 2 ]   On the Waterfront , being about a heroic mob informer, is widely considered to be Kazan's answer to his critics (including his former friend and collaborator Miller), showing that there could be nobility in a man who ""named names."" In the movie, variations of that phrase are repeatedly used by Terry Malloy. The film also repeatedly emphasizes the waterfront's code of ""D and D"" or ""Deaf and Dumb,"" remaining silent at all costs and not ""ratting out"" one's friends. In the end, Malloy does just that and his doing so is depicted sympathetically. Miller's response to the movie's message is contained in his own play,  A View from the Bridge , which presents a contrasting view of those who inform on others.     [ edit ]   Awards and honors   In 1989, this film was deemed ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"" by the  Library of Congress  and selected for preservation in the United States  National Film Registry . It is also on the  Vatican 's list of 45 greatest films of all time, compiled in 1995 [ 3 ] .

Premiered:  September 19, 1994 When is it on?:  Thursdays at 10pm ET on NBC (Check local listings). The show can also be found in syndication on numerous channels. Starring:  Laura Innes as Dr. Kerry Weaver   Goran Visnjic as Dr. Luka Kovac    Maura Tierney as Dr. Abby Lockhart    Mekhi Phifer as Dr. Gregory Pratt    Parminder Nagra as Dr. Neela Rasgotra    Linda Cardellini as Nurse Samantha Taggart    Scott Grimes as Dr. Archie Morris    Shane West as Dr. Ray Barnett Big Names on the Small Screen:  Several big names have gone through that emergency room, including: George Clooney, Vondie Curtis-Hall, Julianna Margulies, Noah Wyle, CCH Pounder, Anthony Edwards, Ray Liotta, Red Buttons and Sally Field to name a few. Trivia Fact #1:  The basketball net you see outside of the ER is used by many of the actors to help unwind during/after shooting. Trivia Fact #2:  Noah Wylie and his character, John Carter both share the same birthday: June 4th. Trivia Fact #3:  The show does most of the filming in Los Angeles, but twice a year, they do on-location filming in Chicago. Trivia Fact #4:  The character of Carol Hathaway, played by Julianna Margulies was supposed to become brain-dead after a suicide attempt, but the writers decided to make her a series regular. Rae's Take:  After ten years, I still find ""ER"" as refreshing as the first season. The constant turnover of characters keeps viewers on their toes. Plane crashes, gunfire, romantic interludes, and challenging medical cases keeps the element of surprise alive and well. I don't see why this series won't last another few years before audiences completely tune out. “ER” is still Tivo-worthy after all these years. Synopsis:   ""ER""  tracks the inner workings of County General Hospital, a Level One Trauma Center where heroic doctors and nurses are faced with life-and-death decisions on a daily basis. The chief of staff, Dr. Kerry Weaver (Innes), a tough and determined administrator, finds herself at a personal crossroads, trying to strike a balance between her life as a doctor and the life she now wants as a woman.      Also on staff are Dr. Luka Kovac (Visnjic), an ER attending physician from Croatia who is searching – sometimes self-destructively – for something to fill the void of his lost family and failed relationships; Abby Lockhart (Tierney), who recently made the professional transition from nurse to doctor, is making a serious effort to turn her personal life around and Dr. Gregory Pratt (Phifer), a brash, third-year resident with a checkered background that won’t stop haunting him.      Recent additions to the ER include Neela Rasgotra (Nagra), a British-Indian medical student who arrives in Chicago after finishing her undergraduate degree in biophysics and molecular biology at Yale. Samantha Taggart (Cardellini) is a nurse and spirited single mother determined to save lives in a place where nothing is taken for granted.      Dr. Ray Barnett (West) has come aboard as a doctor who would sometimes rather be playing in his band than treating patients. He has a way with the ladies and a knack for making things go smoothly, most of the time.      Summary provided by   NBC Universal .

The screenplay by  Robert Ardrey  was directed by  Fred M. Wilcox . It centers on a young  orphan  who is thrust into the dark and mysterious lives of her widowed uncle and his crippled son when she comes to live with them in their isolated country house in  Yorkshire, England .   The  MGM  release was filmed primarily in black-and-white, with the sequences set in the restored garden of the title filmed in  Technicolor .

Dickon, the brother of one of the house maids, tells her of a garden secreted behind a hidden door in a vine-covered wall. When a raven unearths the key, the two enter and discover the garden is overgrown from neglect since Craven's wife died there in an accident. They decide to keep their discovery a secret, and begin to restore it to its original grandeur. Under the influence of the Secret Garden, Mary becomes less self-absorbed, Colin's health steadily improves, and Archibald's curmudgeonly personality fades away.

The recently-orphaned Mary Lennox travels from her home in  India  to her uncle Archibald Craven's hundred-room house, Misselthwaite Manor, in  Yorkshire ,  England . Mary, materially spoiled but emotionally neglected by her late parents, is rather unpleasant and unhappy in her new surroundings. Martha, a Yorkshire girl working as a maid, and her brother  Dickon Sowerby , a boy who can talk to animals, befriend and help her to heal and grow. She discovers her deceased aunt's secret garden, which has been locked for ten years and enlists Dickon to help her bring it to life.   Hidden away in the gloomy house is Mary's cousin Colin, who has been treated all his life like a fragile, sickly invalid. This exaggeration has augmented what smaller problems he did have, turning him into a demanding, short-tempered, helpless boy. Mary, defying the orders of Mrs Medlock (who runs Misselthwaite), discovers Colin and is taken aback by his disposition, but reaches out to him anyway. Soon Colin, Mary, and Dickon all spend their time in the secret garden. They perform ""magic""; barefoot, they make a large bonfire and play a flute, dance round it, and chant, while Colin asks the magic to send his father. Colin learns to walk and gets quite well, which his father Archibald discovers upon his return to Misselthwaite.     [ edit ]   Differences between film and book   A number of minor changes were made in adapting the story for the screen, though the major plot points and character qualities remain, resulting in a considerably faithful retelling. Following is a list of some of the differences:     In the book, Mary's parents die of cholera epidemic; in the film, an earthquake and the resulting mayhem (a charging elephant and a fire at a large party) lead to their deaths.   In the book, Mary is blonde, plain and sallow; in the film, she has brown hair and appears to be considerably healthier and pretty rather than plain.   In the book, Archibald Craven's wife is Mary's aunt through her father. In the movie, his wife was twin sister to Mary's mother.   In the book, Mary discovers the key to the locked garden rather by accident after a robin digs it up. In the movie, she finds it in her aunt's room and initially doesn't know what it is for, but remembers it when finding the door to the garden.   In the book, Mary finds the door to the garden when the wind blows back the ivy covering it. In the movie, a robin leads her to the area where the door is before the wind blows away the ivy.   Mrs. Medlock of this film is a much more stern character than her counterpart in the book.   In the book, Martha and Dickon's mother, Susan Sowerby, writes to Archibald and requests that he should go home to the children. This is after he has had the dream which is partly interpreted in the film, of his wife saying she is in the garden. However, in the film, he has the dream because of the influence of Colin's magic in wanting him home, and Susan Sowerby has nothing to do with it.   A romantic attraction between Mary and Dickon, and Colin towards Mary, is hinted at in the film, but is not evident in the book.   In the movie, Mary's wardrobe is black, whereas in the book her new wardrobe is colorful because Mr. Craven despises black.   In the book Dickon has red hair, but in the film, he has dark brown hair.   In the book, Archibald Craven's wife Lilias fell out of a tree when the branch snapped, and died from the fall, and the tiring incident of Colin's birth. In the film, she fell off the swing, and the pre-mentioned events then followed.   In the book, Colin Craven has his mother's grey eyes, and Mary resembles her by her hair, and other features. However, in the film, Lord Craven suggests that it is Mary who has her aunt's eyes, and Colin says he looks nothing like his mother.   The pictures of Lord Craven and his pregnant wife on the swing never existed in the book.   In the film, Mary's aunt and mother, being twin sisters, which is not true in the book, have similar things. Mary mentions a similar dressing table. And also, the ivory elephant of her mother's which Mary breaks in her anger before the earthquake (also not true in the book) has a twin which sits on that very dressing table in her aunt's room. However, in the book, Mary never visits her aunts room, and sees the ivory elephants in what she calls an Indian room, while wandering about when she first comes to Misselthwaite.       [ edit ]   Response     [ edit ]   Critical Reception   Since its 1993 release, the film has garnered exceptionally positive reviews and currently garners a rare 100% ""fresh"" approval rating on the  Rotten Tomatoes  website.

""It's not easy to make an albino monk who self flagellates buck naked and has glow-in-the-dark eyes into a boring, unmotivated nothing. But they do it.""    ""Mr. Hanks is badly miscast here""    ""This may be remembered as one of the worst major movie scripts ever. Really. Not hyperbole. There have been worse. But rarely do you see so much mess made of so much that seem interesting. There is not a single good piece of dialogue I can remember from the film.""    ""I have no idea how loyal Akiva Goldsman was to the book, but there is no element of the film nearly as bad as the screenplay.""    ""The film was not good, but it didn't become painful until it passed the two-hour mark. One reason for this is that even though the film has no real act structure, it felt as though the story was coming to an end, however unsatisfying, at that two hour mark. And then it went on for another 30 minutes.""

The New York Times weighed in today on this  non-story about  The Da Vinci Code , and at the bottom of the article, they finally get to the point: With movie research showing awareness of the film at 96 percent, and the barometer of ""definite interest"" polling at around 60 percent, the studio is most concerned to do nothing that could put a dent in those figures. Industry estimates of the film's expected ticket sales for the opening weekend at the domestic box office range from $70 million to over $100 million.  But then, I think  mediabistro.com  put it best: Honestly, why Sony wouldn't just come out and say: Look, we're in the anticipation business. There's a reason why strippers don't walk on stage nude. However, the reviews are now trickling in, and the news isn't good so far:    Variety : ""A pulpy page-turner in its original incarnation as a huge international bestseller has become a stodgy, grim thing in the exceedingly literal-minded film version of  The Da Vinci Code .""    The Globe and Mail : ""There was blood in the water by the Palais tonight, and it didn't belong to Jesus Christ. After the 8:30 showing of  The Da Vinci Code , which was the world's first screening of the film for the public (that is, people who are not studio functionaries and yes men), critics from around the world tore into Ron Howard's hugely anticipated (or maybe just hugely hyped) adaptation of Dan Brown's potboiler.""    AP : ""Even at two and a half hours, director Ron Howard's adaptation feels cursory and rushed.""    Hollywood Reporter : ""For those who hate Dan Brown's best-selling symbology thriller  The Da Vinci Code , the eagerly awaited and much-hyped movie version beautifully exposes all its flaws and nightmares of logic.""    The New York Times : ""So I certainly can't support any calls for boycotting or protesting this busy, trivial, inoffensive film. Which is not to say I'm recommending you go see it.""                                          May 16, 2006 in  Reviews ,  Ron Howard ,  The Da Vinci Code ,  The New York Times     |   Permalink            |        Comments (0)                 |        TrackBack (0)                              Digg This     |   Save to del.icio.us                             The Da Vinci Code - Hiding from Reviewers?                   There was a lot of noise this week  about how no one has seen  The Da Vinci Code  yet.  Since we know that studios have now developed a new strategy of not showing bad films to reviewers, that means that  The Da Vinci Code  must be a stinker.  Right?    Stop.  Just stop it.  Stop over-reacting and think for a moment.    Two things:    I have in my grubby little hands, an invitation to go to the reviewers pre-screening of  The Da Vinci Code .  It's this Tuesday, before the film opens, just like 95% of the films that are released normally.  They are  NOT  hiding this film from reviewers.    Having said that, this is simply more evidence that the studios are (finally) continuing to use the tactics of premieres and reviews to their strategic advantage.  While it's true that ""no outsiders have seen Ron Howard's two-and-a-half-hour opus"" YET (remember that the film doesn't open for 6 more days), and that ""Sony has forgone the usual advance press screenings and a splashy stateside premiere,"" they are doing so for a reason.  They are trying to build excitement and anticipation leading up to their world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival.    If everyone from Billy Joe Bob's MovieSite.com has a review of the film this week, if buzz about how good or bad the movie ripped through Hollywood too early, Sony wouldn't get the results they're looking for when  The Da Vinci Code  does debut.  Simple.  Case closed.    (Note that I'm saying nothing about whether the film is good or bad based on Sony's tactics here.  I'm just saying you shouldn't immediately believe that the film is bad, just because no one has seen it yet.  I mean come on... this isn't  Mortal Kombat 27  here.  It's Tom Hanks and Ron Howard.)    Of course, after seeing what Sony did for PlayStation 3 at E3 this week ($600?!?!  Did you see how big that thing was?!?!?), maybe they actually don't know what they're doing here... but I doubt it.

Hoberman   Published on December 08, 2008 at 2:17pm   Has any president since Lincoln inspired more movies, TV miniseries, and operas than Richard Nixon? As Nixon's beetle brows, ski nose, and mirthless grin were made for caricature, so his rampant pathology was a gift for novelists and psycho-historians.                Ralph Nelson                        Chewing on Bacon: Nixon (Frank Langella) scolds his aide (Kevin Bacon)           Details: FROST/NIXON   directed by Ron Howard  area theaters, starts Friday   Frost/Nixon , dutifully directed by Ron Howard from screenwriter Peter Morgan's enjoyably glib play, is the latest installment of the Nixoniad, appropriately set in a media hall of mirrors. The subject is not Watergate but its aftermath—the series of four televised interviews with the disgraced 37th president that British chat star David Frost orchestrated and syndicated in the spring of 1977, a little less than three years after Nixon's resignation.    The interviews were the subject of intense interest even before they happened. The media hyped itself. The details of the deal, including Nixon's $600,000 payday, were breathlessly reported. Mike Wallace created an anticipatory meta-event by interviewing interviewer Frost on  60 Minutes . The event itself rated the cover of both  TV Guide  and  Time . Devoted largely to Watergate and including what was taken to be Nixon's apology, the first interview was among the top shows of 1977, attracting 45 million viewers. The mimic David Frye, then known as the world's greatest Nixon impersonator, modified his act—restaging the interview and taking both parts. Frost and Nixon each produced follow-up best sellers, with Frost's behind-the-scenes account,  I Gave Them a Sword , serving as the basis for Morgan's 2006 play, a hit first in London and then New York.    A docudramatist whose screen credits include  The Queen  and  The Last King of Scotland , Morgan conceived the Frost-Nixon interviews as a prizefight between two comeback-hungry veterans, only one of whom could win. Ever-cheerful Frost (Michael Sheen, wide-eyed and so coiffed as to be a distraction) meets sonorous, gloomy Nixon (Frank Langella) for the equivalent of the pre-bout weigh-in. The former president is immune to Frost's preternatural perkiness even as he peppers the air with misfired jokes. Chronology is tweaked to give events a sports-match tension. As soon as the cameras roll, Frost takes a wild swing—asking why Nixon didn't just destroy the incriminating tapes—and opens himself up to a bludgeoning counterattack.    Round 1 ends with Nixon running down the clock as Frost is forced to spend his downtime dashing from sponsor to sponsor, trying to line up ads. In Round 2, Frost attempts to ambush Nixon by surprising him with actual atrocity footage of his Cambodian invasion. Nixon ducks this roundhouse and leaves Frost hugging the ropes. It's all pretty lugubrious until the big invented scene, when the former president places a drunken call to Frost's hotel room, seeking a measure of class solidarity: ""Did the snobs look down on you, too?""    Howard has beefed up the supporting roles—Kevin Bacon plays Nixon's aide, Oliver Platt and Sam Rockwell are Frost's researchers, and Rebecca Hall has the decorative role of Frost's mistress. In opening up the play, however, the movie unavoidably dissipates its power. Having Nixon's actual lair, the so-called Casa Pacifica, as a location is considerably less compelling than the stripped-down onstage set, in which Langella and Sheen competed not just with each other but their giant, multiplied video images. (There's a profound poetic justice in that, as historian David Greenberg has argued; Nixon was the first American president preeminently concerned with the construction of his image.)    Of course,  Frost/Nixon  does provide a certain bitter pleasure, appearing as George W. Bush slips into ignominy. In the season's current scholarly Nixonalysis,  Reinventing Richard Nixon , Daniel Frick describes  Frost/Nixon 's Broadway audience chuckling as Langella delivered Nixon's sound-bite justification for his abuse of power (""When the president does it, that means it's not illegal""), but reserving true merriment for the follow-up line (""But I realize that no one else shares that view""), as if to acknowledge that the current White House occupant does share Nixon's view and had gone him one better.    Still,  Frost/Nixon 's main attraction is neither its topicality nor its historical value but Langella's re-creation of his Tony-winning performance. Anthony Hopkins was even stiffer than the man himself ( Nixon , 1995), but, each in his way, Rip Torn ( Blind Ambition , 1979) and Philip Baker Hall ( Secret Honor , 1984) were fabulous Nixons, while Dan Hedaya ( Dick , 1999) made the most of his uncanny resemblance. Langella brings something else to the role: He doesn't shake his jowls or attempt Nixon's sickly smile. Ice-cold and physically imposing, the actor is a naturally menacing presence; his stooped, shambling, eye-rolling Nixon is like a prehistoric beast at bay. Howard follows Nixon's confession (""I brought myself down—I gave them a sword"") with the show-stopping image of the stricken leader absurdly pausing to pet a fan's doggy on his way to the limo of oblivion.    In this, Langella captures something of the 1977 Nixon. As  New York Times  columnist Anthony Lewis wrote at the time, ""the first Frost interview made this dreadful creature seem pathetic."" In his 1970 speech on Cambodia, Nixon had warned that America would become ""a pitiful helpless giant."" Langella's performance is the lament of a man who became what he beheld.                write your comment                                                                                          Advanced Archive Search >>                                   Weekly    Music    Promotions    Dining    Events              Subscribe                                                                                         Now Click This             The Edge - Westword Ski and Snowboard Guide                 Picked 2 Click                 College Survival Guide                 Minnesota Music Directory                 Metropolitan Living Guide                 Virtual Career Fair                 Digital Jukebox                                      Free Classifieds Minneapolis, MN             buy, sell, trade (1,727)   musician (833)   rentals (1,456)   jobs (1,504)   adult entertainment (3,104)                                   Personal of the Day                                                         More Personals >>                                                                                   back to top                                       Entire contents ©2009, City Pages LLC, 401 North Third Street, Suite 550, Minneapolis, MN 55401.

The recently-orphaned Mary Lennox travels from her home in  India  to her uncle Archibald Craven's hundred-room house, Misselthwaite Manor, in  Yorkshire ,  England . Mary, materially spoiled but emotionally neglected by her late parents, is rather unpleasant and unhappy in her new surroundings. Martha, a Yorkshire girl working as a maid, and her brother  Dickon Sowerby , a boy who can talk to animals, befriend and help her to heal and grow. She discovers her deceased aunt's secret garden, which has been locked for ten years and enlists Dickon to help her bring it to life.   Hidden away in the gloomy house is Mary's cousin Colin, who has been treated all his life like a fragile, sickly invalid. This exaggeration has augmented what smaller problems he did have, turning him into a demanding, short-tempered, helpless boy. Mary, defying the orders of Mrs Medlock (who runs Misselthwaite), discovers Colin and is taken aback by his disposition, but reaches out to him anyway. Soon Colin, Mary, and Dickon all spend their time in the secret garden. They perform ""magic""; barefoot, they make a large bonfire and play a flute, dance round it, and chant, while Colin asks the magic to send his father. Colin learns to walk and gets quite well, which his father Archibald discovers upon his return to Misselthwaite.     [ edit ]   Differences between film and book   A number of minor changes were made in adapting the story for the screen, though the major plot points and character qualities remain, resulting in a considerably faithful retelling. Following is a list of some of the differences:     In the book, Mary's parents die of cholera epidemic; in the film, an earthquake and the resulting mayhem (a charging elephant and a fire at a large party) lead to their deaths.   In the book, Mary is blonde, plain and sallow; in the film, she has brown hair and appears to be considerably healthier and pretty rather than plain.   In the book, Archibald Craven's wife is Mary's aunt through her father. In the movie, his wife was twin sister to Mary's mother.   In the book, Mary discovers the key to the locked garden rather by accident after a robin digs it up. In the movie, she finds it in her aunt's room and initially doesn't know what it is for, but remembers it when finding the door to the garden.   In the book, Mary finds the door to the garden when the wind blows back the ivy covering it. In the movie, a robin leads her to the area where the door is before the wind blows away the ivy.   Mrs. Medlock of this film is a much more stern character than her counterpart in the book.   In the book, Martha and Dickon's mother, Susan Sowerby, writes to Archibald and requests that he should go home to the children. This is after he has had the dream which is partly interpreted in the film, of his wife saying she is in the garden. However, in the film, he has the dream because of the influence of Colin's magic in wanting him home, and Susan Sowerby has nothing to do with it.   A romantic attraction between Mary and Dickon, and Colin towards Mary, is hinted at in the film, but is not evident in the book.   In the movie, Mary's wardrobe is black, whereas in the book her new wardrobe is colorful because Mr. Craven despises black.   In the book Dickon has red hair, but in the film, he has dark brown hair.   In the book, Archibald Craven's wife Lilias fell out of a tree when the branch snapped, and died from the fall, and the tiring incident of Colin's birth. In the film, she fell off the swing, and the pre-mentioned events then followed.   In the book, Colin Craven has his mother's grey eyes, and Mary resembles her by her hair, and other features. However, in the film, Lord Craven suggests that it is Mary who has her aunt's eyes, and Colin says he looks nothing like his mother.   The pictures of Lord Craven and his pregnant wife on the swing never existed in the book.   In the film, Mary's aunt and mother, being twin sisters, which is not true in the book, have similar things. Mary mentions a similar dressing table. And also, the ivory elephant of her mother's which Mary breaks in her anger before the earthquake (also not true in the book) has a twin which sits on that very dressing table in her aunt's room. However, in the book, Mary never visits her aunts room, and sees the ivory elephants in what she calls an Indian room, while wandering about when she first comes to Misselthwaite.       [ edit ]   Response     [ edit ]   Critical Reception   Since its 1993 release, the film has garnered exceptionally positive reviews and currently garners a rare 100% ""fresh"" approval rating on the  Rotten Tomatoes  website.

At the movie's LA premiere, Howard talked about what makes David Frost's interviews of ex-President Richard Nixon so compelling.

Frost/Nixon  Director/Producer Ron Howard    When you saw this onstage, what made you think you could make it into a movie?  Ron Howard:  ""Great drama, great characters. And, you know, in fact surprising characters in that kind of conflict is always incredibly cinematic. And when I was watching the play, as much as I was loving it, I was dying to grab a camera and get in there, bore in on these two great actors – Michael Sheen and Frank Langella - and give film audiences a chance to see what they were up to.""   And working with writer Peter Morgan – did you two collaborate or were you more hands-off?  Ron Howard:  ""Well, Peter Morgan wrote  The Queen  and  Last King of Scotland  and so many great, great films and television films and he was sort of experimenting and dabbling as a playwright, so he was fantastic with the adaptation. And I had a set of ideas which he, for the most part, agreed with.  In fact, I felt the adaptation went very smoothly. It was also fueled by more research and so new ideas for little scenes and insights into the characters were coming to us all the time as we were making the circuit and talking to people who lived through it.""   What makes you think this is still relevant today? What is it that grabs audiences about this particular story?  Ron Howard:  ""It happens to deal with a character who, you know, abused the power of the presidency and there are a lot of people who feel that's what we've had for the last eight years. But that's not front and center. It's not the reason that Peter wanted to write it or I wanted to direct it, but it's certainly a relatable aspect. This is relevant because anytime you have characters as sort of unexpectedly intense as David Frost or Richard Nixon are, it yields great, great drama. I think people are always surprised when they see this film, and I think they were surprised when they saw the play, too, because they think it's going to be a reenactment of interviews but in fact they just had no idea what went on behind the scenes and how suspenseful and funny and emotional all that turned out to be.""   You did so much research on this, do you think Nixon actually did feel that as a president it was okay to lie, that nothing was illegal when you're president?  Ron Howard:  ""I didn't read this, no one said this to me, but I have a theory that at that time as a president in the Cold War – this is not making an apology for Richard Nixon – but I think he felt like he was playing with one hand tied behind his back. He had this damn democracy that he had to worry about but his main opponents – Russia and China – they didn't. I think he felt that there were probably times when an American president just had to have the nerve to stand up and play hardball. And he was wrong. He was wrong, but he was also...  You know, intellectually he was brilliant. As a sort of geopolitical visionary he was quite remarkable, but all that said, you know, his personal character defects not only brought him down and brought him to shame, but it also really harmed our nation. You can admire him for certain reasons but he can't be forgiven.""   After watching the film it was strange for me because I was sympathetic toward him, and I've never felt that way before. Have you experienced that?  Ron Howard:  ""Well, you know, in trying to present a balanced drama you want to humanize the characters and make them as relatable as possible. And so in doing that I hope it does create empathy for him, not necessarily sympathy but understanding. That's what Shakespeare did better than anyone ever has or will is to sort of shine a light on even craziness.""

Nixon three years after he left office, trimming their nearly 30-hour armchair-to-armchair spar into a tidy 122-minute narrative of loss and redemption that, at least from this ringside seat, would be better titled Nixon/Frost.  Manohla Dargis, The New York Times   Full New York Times Review        Movie Details     Title:  Frost/Nixon Running Time:  122 Minutes Status:  Released Country:  United States Genre:  Drama, Adaptation, Historical   Go to Cast & Credits                   Related Articles     MOVIES, PERFORMING ARTS/WEEKEND DESK     'Frost/Nixon,' 'Button' and 'Doubt' Lead in Nominations for Golden Globes   By BROOKS BARNES; Paula Schwartz contributed reporting from New York.

Not only did this event at the Paley Center for Media in NY feature the screening of Frost/Nixon, it also including a panel afterward of  Ron Howard , the director;  Brian Grazer , the producer and  Peter Morgan , the writer. It was an amazing night and a fantastic movie. The History David Frost , an English talk show host, did a series of interviews with former President  Richard Nixon  that were broadcast in 1977 and got him to admit his guilt in  Watergate . This was one of the most watched news events ever, and the biggest audience  PBS  ever had. This story was made into a play by Peter Morgan and opened in London in August 2006. It then moved to Broadway in March 2007. The same leads,  Frank Langella  as Nixon and  Michael Sheen  as David Frost played the parts in London, Broadway and in the Film. The Movie Frost/Nixon had everything. It was much funnier than I thought it would be. There was also a great deal of suspense for a movie in which the ending is known (Ron Howard is a master at this; I was on the edge of my seat throughout  Apollo 13 ). And needless to say, the acting was phenomenal. Frank Langella is a shoe-in for an Oscar nomination. The Panel The panel talk afterwards was very interesting and brought up some  generational issues . Ron Howard was the only one of the three that had actually watched the real interviews on PBS. A member of the audience asked Howard what his children thought of the movie.  Ron said  that he thought about how when making this movie he hoped that it would be able   to help the  younger generation better understand Watergate and Nixon and that time period . However, he said that his kids were most amazed that so many millions of people all tuned in to one channel to watch the same show. I laughed while thinking of the post I wrote  Too many Television shows for our teens to have shared memories as adult s. The  writer, Peter Morgan , said that being British and too young to remember Watergate, made it easier for him to write because he was able to remain detached. Although he did say that it is possible,  subconsciously , that the script contained war issues more than any other besides Watergate because of Iraq. That maybe if he was writing the script right now, there would have been more economy issues. I highly recommend this movie for anybody 13 and up. It is entertaining, educational and enthralling.

What a great review! I cannot wait to see this movie now. How cool that you got to go to an early screening!          December 3, 2008 8:20 PM                     Anonymous said...      I live near Columbus, Ga, Home of Ft. Benning (and the US Infantry and the US Army's ""Rangers"").  Columbus has always been at the very right end of the political spectrum, as has it's major newspaper, the Columbus Ledger-Enquirer.  In earlier generations, it was a major cotton mill hub, wanting to keep a low wage earning population base.  It has since become a major Insurance and Bank center, but it's very conservative nature hasn't changed. During the theatrical playing of ""W."", there was only (1) theater in Columbus' many complexes, and was on=screen for only one week.  Needless to say, it was not screened in either of the (10) available theaters at Ft. Benning.)  You must take quick advantage of any information which shows our National Leaders in anything but a holistic glow.  When ""Frost|Nixon"" made it's early premier, it had really hoped that the recent elections, showing our contempt of the State of Our Nation, the theaters in Columbus would take it's opportunity to broaden the information range of it's people. My hopes were jilted; I will have to wait until it's Christmas release and hope I can find time during the week that this film, which has been nominated for (5) Academy Awards, will make it's way into a single theater in Columbus. God willing, I will get to that theater - I will make every possible effort.  Wish me luck!

It was adapted by Lubitsch (uncredited) and  Edwin Justus Mayer  from the story by  Melchior Lengyel . The film stars  Carole Lombard ,  Jack Benny ,  Robert Stack ,  Felix Bressart ,  Lionel Atwill ,  Stanley Ridges  and  Sig Ruman .   The title is a reference to the famous "" To be, or not to be ""  soliloquy  in  William Shakespeare 's  Hamlet .  To Be or Not to Be  was released two months after actress Carole Lombard was killed in an airplane crash.

The film opens with the seemingly impossible appearance of  Adolf Hitler  in Warsaw (this is before the 1939 invasion). We discover that this is a local actor, Bronski, who is playing Hitler in a planned new work satirizing the  Nazis  (the play's highly realistic sets and costumes will be crucial later on). After Bronski halted rehearsals by improvising, ""Heil myself!"", his resemblance to Hitler was called into question, so he took to the streets to prove himself. His effort fails when a young girl asks for the autograph of ""Mr. Bronski"".   The action then shifts to later that night. While rehearsing the new play, the theater company has also been performing Shakespeare's  Hamlet , with Maria as  Ophelia  and Tura in the title role. Bronski commiserates with his friend and colleague, Greenberg, about always being the ones to ""carry a spear,"" instead of having starring roles. Greenberg reveals it has always been his dream to perform  Shylock , especially the famous ""Hath not a  Jew  eyes?..."" speech.   Meanwhile, Maria is inspecting a bouquet of flowers she has received, the third bunch in as many days. These turn out to come from a handsome young pilot named Lieutenant Stanislav Sobinski. Sobinski sends a note asking for permission to finally meet Maria, and she agrees, telling him to come to her dressing room when her husband begins his ""To be or not to be..."" speech, so they can be sure of privacy. As a result, the young man walks out (very obviously) just as Tura begins his monologue -- causing the highly-strung actor great distress. Maria is attracted to Sobinski when they meet, and the two arrange to meet again.   A few days later, at another performance of  Hamlet , Sobinski again walks out during Tura's speech (this has clearly become his and Maria's ""thing""). Sobinski by now assumes that Maria will leave her husband, give up acting, and come live with him on a farm. Before Maria can finish putting him right, her maid rushes in, saying Germany has declared war on Poland. Sobinski leaves to join the fight and the actors take shelter under the theater as bombs begin to fall.   A montage and voice-over show us Hitler conquering Poland, and tell us that the Polish division of England's  Royal Air Force  is fighting to free its mother country. We cut to this very division, where Lt. Sobinski and other young pilots are singing a rousing song with an apparent  Polish resistance  leader named Prof. Siletsky. Siletsky intimates that he will be returning to Warsaw soon, and joyous at the chance to contact their families, the pilots write down addresses for the professor to visit. Sobinski asks Siletsky to give Maria the message ""To be or not to be"", but his suspicions are aroused when Siletsky, who claims to have lived in Warsaw, does not know who the famous Maria Tura is.   Sobinski tells his superiors, who send him to Warsaw to warn the resistance about Siletsky. Sobinski is unable to contact them but does manage to reach Maria, who passes the message on in his stead. Immediately after, she is stopped by two Nazi soldiers, who have been ordered by Siltesky to bring her to his hotel. Siletsky delivers Sobinski's message and invites Maria to dinner, hoping to recruit her as a spy for the Nazis. She pretends to be interested and goes home ""to change her clothes."" Just before she arrives at her apartment, Tura returns and Maria, Tura and Stanislav end up in a three-way conversation in which Maria and Stanislav try to figure out what to do (kill Siletsky, they conclude), and Tura tries to figure out what on Earth is going on. In the end, Tura proclaims that  he  will kill Siletsky.   Later that evening, Mrs. Tura returns to the professor's room and pretends to be attracted to him. Just as they kiss, there is a knock at the door. It is a Nazi officer (whom we recognize as one of the members of the acting company). He informs the professor that he is wanted at  Gestapo  headquarters, but actually escorts him to the theater, which has been hastily disguised with props and costumes from the play.   Tura pretends to be Col. Ehrhardt of the Gestapo, but Siletsky sees through the ruse. He tries to escape, but is shot and killed by Sobinski on the stage of the theater. Tura returns to the hotel disguised as Siletsky in a fake beard and glasses, to destroy the information about the Polish resistance that Siletsky has in his trunk. Unfortunately, he's met at the hotel by the real Col. Ehrhardt's adjutant, Capt. Schultz, and taken to meet Ehrhardt himself. Luckily, Tura manages to pass himself off as Siletsky and learns during their meeting that Hitler himself will visit Poland the next day.   The next day, the real Siletsky's body is discovered in the theater. Ehrhardt sends for Maria to tell her, but she is unable to warn Tura in time, and he arranges another meeting with Ehrhardt, again posing as Siletsky. When Tura arrives, Ehrhardt sends him into a room with Siletsky's dead body in it, hoping to frighten him into a confession. Ad libbing like a pro, however, Tura shaves off Siletsky's beard and then attaches a spare fake beard that he was carrying in his pocket. He then calls Ehrhardt into the room and manipulates him into pulling Siletsky's now-fake beard off. This seems to prove that the real Siletsky was actually the imposter, but just as Tura is about to make his escape, the other actors (sent by Maria and again in Nazi costume) storm into Ehrhardt's office, yank off Tura's false beard and pretend to drag him away to prison. This does get Tura out of Gestapo headquarters, but now he cannot leave the country on the plane Ehrhardt had arranged for him, and it's only a matter of time before the actors' ruse is discovered.   Now the actors make their boldest gambit of all. The Nazis put on a show at the theater to welcome Hitler (the soldiers perform), and Sobinski and the actors sneak in, again dressed as Nazis. Prominent among them is Bronski, initially without his Hitler mustache from the play. The actors hide in the powder rooms until Hitler arrives and takes his seat, and then, as the Nazis are singing the German national anthem inside, Greenberg suddenly appears from the ladies' room and charges toward Hitler's box. This distracts the Fuhrer's guards long enough for Bronski, now wearing a Hitler mustache, to emerge unnoticed from the men's room and pretend to have come out of Hitler's box surrounded by his ""entourage.""   Playing the head of Hitler's men, Tura demands to know what Greenberg wants from the Fuhrer, and Greenberg finally gets his chance to deliver Shylock's famous speech, infusing it with all his love for Poland and his hatred of the Nazis that have subjugated it. He ends with a ringing ""if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?!"" and Tura orders his ""officers"" to take Greenberg away. He also recommends that Bronski/Hitler leave Poland immediately, and all the actors march out, get in Hitler's car and drive away.   Meanwhile, back at her apartment, Maria is waiting for the actors to pick her up on their way to the airport. They all intend to leave on Hitler's plane, but Col. Ehrhardt shows up and tries to seduce her (offering extra butter rations and a beautiful bracelet he confiscated just that day). Ehrhardt is utterly floored, however, when the door opens and Bronski walks in disguised as Hitler. He's come up in place of Tura, who's lost his fake mustache and can't leave the car (the real Nazis driving it would realize he's a fake). Equally shocked, Bronski turns and walks out in silence, but Ehrhardt immediately thinks that Maria is having an affair with Hitler and that he has just been caught trying to steal the Fuhrer's girl. It's the perfect opportunity for Maria, who dashes after Bronski calling, ""Mein Fuhrer, Mein Fuhrer!"" and escapes with the other actors.   All the actors take off in the plane. They easily dispose of the real Nazi pilots -- Bronski, still dressed as Hitler, simply orders them to jump out of the plane (at about 10,000 feet and  without  parachutes); the mindlessly obedient pilots instantly leap to their deaths. Sobinski flies the plane to  Scotland , where Bronski causes a little surprise when he parachutes into a farmer's bale of hay in his Hitler costume and makeup. The actors are soon revealed as heroes. Asked what reward he'd like for his service to the Allies, Tura hems and haws in a show of false modesty, but Maria quickly answers in his stead, ""he wants to play Hamlet.""   In the movie's final scene, Tura is once again on stage as Hamlet and reaches the moment of ""To be or not to be."" He eyeballs Sobinski in the audience as he begins the speech, but  both  of them are struck dumb when a new young man gets up and heads backstage.     [ edit ]   Cast     Carole Lombard  as  Maria Tura  - an actress in Nazi-occupied Poland.   Jack Benny  as  Joseph Tura   an actor and Maria's husband.   Robert Stack  as  Lt. Stanislav Sobinski   a Polish airman in love with Maria.   Stanley Ridges  as  Professor Alexander Siletsky  - A Nazi spy masquerading as a Polish resistance worker; tries to seduce Maria in order to persuade her to become a Nazi spy.       [ edit ]   Production   Lubitsch had never considered anyone other than Jack Benny for the lead role in the film. He had even written the character with Benny in mind. Benny, thrilled that a director of Lubitsch's caliber had been thinking of him while writing it, accepted the role immediately. Benny was in a predicament as, strangely enough, his success in  Charley's Aunt  was not bringing in anyone else who wanted the  vaudeville  actor for any roles in their films.   For Benny's costar, the studio and Lubitsch decided on  Miriam Hopkins , whose career had been faltering in recent years. The role was designed as a comeback for the veteran actress, but Hopkins and Benny did not get along well, and Hopkins left the production. Lubitsch was left without a leading lady until Carole Lombard, hearing his predicament, asked to be considered. Lombard had never worked with the famous director and yearned to have an opportunity. Lubitsch agreed and Lombard was cast. She got along so well with Lubitsch that her husband,  Clark Gable , suspected them of having an affair. The film also provided Lombard with an opportunity to work with friend  Robert Stack , whom she had known since he was an awkward teenager. Also, this film was shot at  United Artists  which gave Lombard boasting rights to say that she had worked at every major studio in  Hollywood . During the post-production of this film, Lombard was killed in a plane crash. Following the release,   Lombard's performance was heavily applauded, although most people found her choice to work on a satire about Nazis in poor taste. Lubitsch, on the other hand, found heavy critique with this film and it diminished his status in Hollywood.  To Be or Not To Be,  now regarded to be one of the best exponents out of all Lubitsch's, Benny's, and Lombard's luminous careers, was not appreciated by the general public who felt that making fun of such a real threat of the Nazis was revolting. It was said that during the premier, Benny's own father walked out of the theater, so disgusted that his son was in a Nazi uniform during the first scene, and he vowed not to set foot in the theater. Benny convinced him otherwise and his father eventually ended up loving the film. The same could not be said for the critics, however. While they praised the late Lombard, they scorned Benny and Lubitsch. To one critic Lubitsch wrote, ""What I have satirized in this picture are the Nazis and their ridiculous ideology. I have also satirized the attitude of actors who always remain actors regardless of how dangerous the situation might be, which I believe is a true observation. It can be argued if the tragedy of  Poland  realistically portrayed as in  To Be or Not to Be  can be merged with satire. I believe it can be and so do the audience which I observed during a screening of To Be or Not to Be; but this is a matter of debate and everyone is entitled to his point of view, but it is certainly a far cry from the Berlin-born director who finds fun in the bombing of Warsaw,"" (Courtesy  TCM ). The critic Mildred Martin later reviewed another of Lubitsch's films and referred with a derogative nature to his  German  birth and his comedy about Nazis in Poland.     [ edit ]   Reception   To Be or Not to Be  flopped upon its release, mainly because the American audience of the time was shocked at what they perceived as a film poking fun at the Nazis' 1939 invasion of Poland. They were especially offended by Colonel Earhardt's line: ""Oh, yes I saw him [Tura] in 'Hamlet' once. What he did to Shakespeare we are now doing to Poland"". However, the film has since become a comedy classic.   The film was nominated for an  Academy Award  for  Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture .     [ edit ]   Awards and honors   In 1996,  To Be or Not to Be  was selected for preservation in the  United States   National Film Registry  by the  Library of Congress  as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".   American Film Institute  recognition     2000:  AFI's 100 Years... 100 Laughs  #49       [ edit ]   Remakes   A radio drama adaptation of  To Be or Not to Be  was produced by the Screen Guild Theatre on Jan. 18, 1943, starring  William Powell  and  Diana Lewis .   The film was  remade  in  1983  by  Mel Brooks . See also:  To Be or Not to Be  (1983 film) .   A  Broadway  stage version written by Nick Whitby and produced by the  Manhattan Theatre Club , New York City, started previews on September 16, 2008 and opened on October 14 at the  Samuel J. Friedman Theatre  for a limited engagement. The play subsequently closed on November 16th of that year. The director was  Casey Nicholaw , with principal cast including Peter Benson,  David Rasche , Peter Maloney and  Jan Maxwell . [ 1 ] [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Analysis     [ edit ]   Judaism   Lubitsch, himself of German Jewish origin, was cautious in the film over making overt references to ""Jewishness"" (including avoiding use of the words Jewish or Jew). Just one character, Greenberg (played by  Felix Bressart ), an actor in the theatrical company, is made obviously Jewish. This is first conveyed during the opening sequence: when Greenberg is quarreling with another actor, he declares, ""What you are I wouldn't eat!"" to which the second responds, ""How dare you call me a ham!"" It emerges that Greenberg's lifelong ambition is to play Shylock in  The Merchant of Venice , yet the three times that Greenberg recites sections of  Shylock 's most famous speech, the word ""Jew"" has in each case been written out.   A prescient line was cut out of the film after the death of  Carole Lombard : when Lombard is invited by Robert Stack's smitten airman to fly in a plane with him, she says: ""What can happen on a plane?"" The line has since been restored to available prints of the film.     [ edit ]   Notes       ^  Jones, Kenneth.

It’s a known fact, because all of these movies want to be known and on voters’ minds when Oscar ballots go out in January. And while you can’t always trust the critics for 11 months out of the year when it comes to blockbusters, action films and comedies, they can be pretty reliable when it comes to dramas. You won’t always agree, but if there’s one genre that professional critics know, it’s drama.   So, I watched Ron Howard’s  Frost/Nixon . Good movie. Great acting, and strong dialogue. But a great movie? One that deserves a Golden Globe nomination? No. And Ron Howard, a Golden Globe nomination for Best Director? Over Christopher Nolan and several other directors? Absolutely no way.   Read my  Frost/Nixon movie review  to see what I have to say about the film.

Answer                          Some men dream the future. He built it.       Producers Synopsis:    The Aviator , directed by Martin Scorsese and written by John Logan, tells the story of aviation pioneer Howard Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio), the eccentric billionaire industrialist and Hollywood film mogul, famous for romancing some of the worlds most beautiful women. The drama recounts the years of his life from the late 1920s through the 1940s, an epoch when Hughes was directing and producing Hollywood movies and test flying innovative aircrafts he designed and created.       Review:              H igh flying adorned but not adored is the new biography picture on Howard Hughes by long time director Martin Scorsese (Mean Streets, Raging Bull, Gangs of New York). The aviator Scorsese depicts here is a man who operates with vision and entrepreneurial skillsand meets with large amounts of worldly successbut is also one with his fair share of weaknesses and problems.        The bulk of this story begins in 1927 Hollywood with Howard Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio) at the age of twenty-six directing his war film Hells Angels. After inheriting a large sum of money after his parents' death, Hughes goes beyond filmmaking to pursue an ambitious career in developing and building airplanes. The conflict of the story eventually develops when Hughes buys TWA and must battle Juan Trippe ( Alec Baldwin ) of Pan Am Airlines and Senator Ralph Owen Brewster ( Alan Alda ) who seem to have a monopoly on the airline business.        Like his other films, Scorsese is not so much interested in plot as he is with character. Raging Bull dealt with a boxers career, but dealt more so with his personal life. In the Aviator, we see the career highlights of Howard Hughes, but also see his failed romances with Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) and Eva Gardner ( Kate Beckinsale ) - although some friendship with them is maintained. Further, we see a Howard Hughes who is a little obsessive/compulsive, who struggles with hearing problems and even suffers from schizophrenia. It seems that all of his achievements that are presented are tempered by some kind of failure he also experienced.        The most off-putting aspect of this film is the repeated use of the Gods name used in vain followed by the word damn. Over and over, and by various characters, we are assaulted with this word. The Lords name is also taken in vain a few times, as well as one instance of the f word. There are a few moments of nudity from behind involving Hughes, first as a young boy being bathed by his mother, and then later when he locks himself in his room and has gone a bit mad. (This scene also includes an unpleasant image of numbers of bottles filled with urine.) There is a moment with Hughes and Hepburn kissing leading to an implication of them sleeping together, but none of it is shown.        Some interesting directorial motifs that Scorsese has included involve bright light bulbs, animal flesh and Hughes' obsession with cleanliness - especially with his hands. Hand washing is such a personal thing to Hughes that at one moment he is unwilling to lend a hand to a crippled man because it would interrupt his hand washing. In another moment, he loses his appetite for his steak after Errol Flynn ( Jude Law ) picks a small pea off of his plate and eats it. We see that Hughes is disgusted and will not eat.        But unlike Raging Bull, Scorsese has given us a protagonist that we can ultimately find likeable and partially respect. Although this character has personal flaws, we believe he is doing the right thing by speaking out against Senator Brewster and Juan Trippe. We can also find him likeable because he is presented as a kind of underdog who worked his way up, making many personal risks along the way. Some may disagree that Howard Hughes was actually this kind of everyman, blue-collar kind of worker. Nevertheless, where Raging Bull gives us a tragic character who thinks hes great, here we have a kind of heroic character who thinks at times he is losing his mind.        This film is lavishly produced with several big stars and lots of CGI, but in the end isnt terribly engaging. Earlier films of Scorsese made on a much smaller scale tended to be more captivating, but these big stories - even though theyre made more personal - dont provide as much interest. Some of it is pretty impressive, but isnt necessarily recommended.        Violence: Mild /       Profanity: Heavy /        Sex/Nudity: Mild                                                                Bible answers available at Christian Answers                                Neutral  - I have to agree with the review made here on Christian Spotlight      that this movie wasnt engaging, and it leaves you hanging on for more      details at the end. I wouldnt recommend this movie to those who are      highly offended by profanity, especially when it involves the Lords name.      I was very offended and very uncomfortable and it affected my enjoyment of      the film. It did make me realize that Hughes was an aviation genius that      propelled our aviation industry. And it also made me understand that he      had a mental illness which he had to battle all his life, but the rest of      the movie was at many times confusing and it had no central plot. It was      too long to endure with no central plot! Overall I would say this movie      was average, and I certainly wouldnt buy it when it comes out on DVD.        My Ratings:  [Extremely Offensive/4]        Maria Gottuso, age 36       Negative  - Prepare to feel empty as a movie goer, and content as a Christian.      The Aviator does a good job of portraying one of the richest men ever as      a one of the strangest men ever. As Christians, it is a message that we      are familiar with and want the world to hear. Money, fame, and power      dont necessarily amount to anything and can ultimately lead to a life of      desperation and failure, especially in the worlds eyes. This is a good      (and true) message. But as I watched this lengthy production, I kept      thinking how much better the movie could have been.              Apart from the message and themes introduced by the film, the acting is      mediocre, the soundtrack is boring, the story is too dark and too slow,      and the casting is borderline horrible. Leonardo DiCaprio tries hard      enough in his role to make the movie watchable, but does not have the      charisma to keep us interested in the main character. Cate Blanchett is      not believable as Katherine Hepburn. And the director seems to have cast      stars like  Alec Baldwin ,  Alan Alda  and  Jude Law  just because the dialogue      in this movie is so bland and the story so choppy that the audience would      never stay interested without them.              Still, I was glad that sex and violence were not emphasized in any part of      this film. But other than that, theres is nothing edifying about this      film and for those people who actually know about some of Howard Hughs      life, this film is not an accurate depiction.        My Ratings:  [Very Offensive/29]        Mike Y., age 2       Positive  - I just viewed The Aviator. The production is well-done showing      great costuming and the glitz of Hollywood in the 1920's through 1940's.      It gives insight into Hughes' interesting life and his oddities. The      flight scenes were particularly exciting. Also, the jazz and big band      music was entertaining throughout.              The use of the g-d*mn word was used liberally from start to finish, and      way too much. There was absolutely no need for it, nor was there a need      to use the word f-k (only once thankfully).              Overall The Aviator was enjoyable and entertaining. However my      enjoyment was tempered by the avalanche of profanity that was so      unnecessary. Nudity was mild and was not particularly offensive.        My Ratings:  [Very Offensive/4]        Eric Williams, age 51       Neutral  - Entertaining and somewhat factual, however language content is      worldly (I wouldnt expect a G rating for this movie). I know., I know&      'We must live in this world but we dont have to be of this world& Id      advise younger viewers of language in the movie but theres nothing      outstanding (shocking) in terms of nudity or content.        My Ratings:  [Average/3]        Josh, age 43       Positive  - Wow. This was one of the best movies Ive seen all year. It      definitely deserves an Oscar nod. As a person who suffers with Obsessive      compulsive disorder, I thought the movies take on it was spot on, it      definitely makes me wonder if Leonardo Dicaprio has experienced this      himself, if not he is truly the most amazing actor of our day. The film      was 3 hours long, and normally I cant sit through long movies, but I      really didnt even notice this one. My only complaint was that Cate      Blanchetts portrayal of Katherine Hepburn (who happens to be one of my      personal heros) seemed too much of a parody, but after a while either she      tones it down or I got used to it.              Obviously due to the length of the      movie, not to mention the fact that they probably wont know or care about      most of the people or events portrayed, you shouldnt bring your kids      along. I recommend it to anyone else though, and if you have kids that are      advanced for their age I would say bring them. There is a plane crash      scene that is WAY to bloody and intense for kids though, so keep that in      mind. If your the type of person who gets uptight about the human body,      you should know that there is some very mild nudity although all we see      is a backside, really nothing to be concerned about, but I know some      people are sensitive about things like that so I thought it might be worth      mentioning. All in all SEE THIS MOVIE, its a fabulous way to spend 3      hours.        My Ratings:  [Better than Average/5]        Kat, age 19       Neutral  - This is a disturbing film about a man losing his mind; it is      suppose to be and they did a good job of it. Hughes' life and the benefit      of his inventions are lost to this generation which is of interest, but      Gods name is taken in vain so many times I lost count.        My Ratings:  [Very Offensive/4]        Ronni, age 42       Positive  - A nearly universal human longing is to be independently wealthy.      As evidence for this, one needs to look no further than the popularity of      state supported gambling. In our culture, Power ball winners make      headlines. The Aviator is a cautionary parable for those who long for      unlimited wealth.              Howard Hughes seemed to have it all. The movie shows how he used this      wealth to make spectacular movies, woo the most glamorous women and build      and fly the fastest and biggest airplanes. Yet despite all of his apparent      success, as seen from the perspective of the world, his life was a      miserable failure. Howard Hughes is portrayed as having low moral      standards. He constantly uses the name of the Lord in vain. Seen from a      Christian perspective, his foul language serves to emphasize his complete      separation from God and his desperate need for God. Freed from the      constraints that most of us live under, his life ultimately spiraled out      of control and he descended into pathologic obsession and madness.              I do not think that becoming a Christian would have solved all of Mr.      Hughes problems. The kinds of personality disorders portrayed in the movie      tend to be very deeply ingrained. However, I think that as a Christian, he      would have been able to live with his problems and not be dominated by      them. For example, as a Christian, I think that it is much more likely      that he would have had the humility to seek professional help for his      obsessive compulsive disorder.              This movie is not appropriate for children younger than 15 or 16 years of      age. Older teenagers and adults, however, may well benefit from seeing      this example of a wasted life and discussing the difference that God might      have made for Mr. Hughes, and the difference he can make for all of us.        My Ratings:  [Average/4]        James Martenson, age 49       Positive  - What a fantastic film! Those seeking to be entertained will      certainly enjoy the first half of the film, which is filled with      spectacular flight sequences and spotlights Hughes' early years in      Hollywood. Those looking for a character-driven film wont be      disappointed by DiCaprios intense performance. If it werent for Jamie      Foxxs equally impressive performance in Ray, DiCaprio would be most      deserving of a Best Actor Oscar. Cate Blanchett also gives a great      performance as Katherine Hepburn, one that goes beyond the typical      impersonation. The film is three hours long, but never boring.              The only drawback to the film is the constant taking of the Lords name in      vain. Fortunately, Scorsese spares us of any sex scenes. There is quite      a bit of rear nudity involving DiCaprio, but it is non-sexual in nature.       Some scenes are difficult to watch. The plan crash scene is quite      graphic, and Hughes' mental problems in the last hour can be quite      unpleasant. For these reasons, I wouldnt take anyone younger than 15 to      see this film. However, most adults will find this to be one of the best      films of the year!        My Ratings:  [Average/5]        Leo G, age 25       Negative  - I wish that I could comment on the entirety of this film.       However, my husband and I left after only fifteen minutes due to the      excessive use of terrible language, particularly the use of the Lords      name in vain. Too bad, because we both felt the movie had potential to be      quite interesting.        My Ratings:  [Extremely Offensive/4]        Tess, age 40       Positive  - An engaging drama that may be the best film in a rather lacklustre      year. Excellent directing and acting, vivid sets, and seamless special      effects all contribute to this lengthy film. An uninspiring      ending, however, and offensive language detract. Not a family film, but      recommended for older teens and adults.        My Ratings:  [Average/4]        Todd Adams, age 37       Negative  - My mother and I went to see this movie. We had heard if was      good. The movie is interesting, and shows Hughes' vision, but is filled      with G*D, and profanity. There is usually some profanity in a movie, but it is all the way through this one. I couldnt believe it for a PG-13 movie. Talk about ratings creep!        My Ratings:  [Very Offensive/5]        Bill Boylston, age 46       Negative  - What a waste of an evening& what a waste of such talent! My 16      year old and I were bored to tears toward the end. Speaking of end& it      was so long that we just lost interest, wanting it to be over. Too much      focus on Hughes being crazy& no music& no real emotional depth from the      characters. Also, lots and lots of profanity! The only bright spot was      Cate Blanchett as Katherine Hepburn& she was wonderful& the rest was not      worth the time nor money!        My Ratings:  [Average/2]        Ally, age 40       Positive  - I definitely thought the profanity could have been toned down      without detracting from the realism of the film. However, in other ways I      thought that this was a very good movie, particularly in its portrayal of      Hughess mental illness. Hughes comes across from the beginning as a      quirky, over-the-top, but strangely likable character, not someone you      would want to emulate or have as a friend, but you do sympathize with him      nonetheless. The sequences that depict his increasing break with reality      are honest in their portrayal of mental illness, and we see the breakdown      of a human being in a way that saddens more than frightens us.              Too many people, even Christians, tend to view mental illness in a light that puts      sufferers in the position of outcasts, even subhuman beings. While this      movie is not for the younger set, adults and youth who are able to deal      with mature themes will find this movie entertaining and      thought-provoking. It is disturbing, yes, but in a way that we need to be      disturbed.        My Ratings:  [Better than Average/2]        Feral Burns, age 22       Negative  - After viewing a portion of this movie, we could no longer tolerate      the offensive language and got up and walked out. Dont waste your money      if you are offended by using the Lords name in vain, because they were      obsessed with that as their dialogue.        My Ratings:  [Extremely Offensive/2]        Teri Harold, age 50+       Movie Critics       &visually sumptuous if disappointingly hollow&        Manhola Dargis, New York Times                              ChristianSpotlight.com - Copyright,  Films for Christ .

The Aviator  follows Hughes (played by  Leonardo DiCaprio ) as the twentysomething millionaire, having already made a fortune improving the design of oil-drilling bits, comes to Hollywood with an interest in getting into the picture business. It doesn't take long for Hughes, with his passion for airplanes, to jump from producer to director of his first major film project, a World War I air epic called  Hell's Angels , which took three years to complete thanks to the shift from silent to sound filming and Hughes' relentless perfectionism. However, the film was a massive hit, and the eccentric inventor became a mogul in Hollywood, making  Jean Harlow  ( Gwen Stefani ) a star and enjoying a romance with  Katharine Hepburn  ( Cate Blanchett ). But Hollywood's old-boy network never fully accepted Hughes, and in time his passion for flying began to reclaim his attentions as he began designing new planes, setting air speed records, flying around the world, and risking his life testing aircraft. Hughes also found time to romance  Ava Gardner  ( Kate Beckinsale ) and founded his own airline, Trans-World Airlines, though as his ideas became bolder, his approach became more eccentric, and he gained many powerful enemies, including the head of Pan-American Airlines, Juan Trippe ( Alec Baldwin ), and Senator Ralph Owen Brewster ( Alan Alda ), who attempted to prove that Hughes' radical design ideas were actually part of an effort to bilk taxpayers for millions of dollars through government contracts.  The Aviator 's star-studded cast also includes  John C. Reilly ,  Jude Law ,  Willem Dafoe ,  Ian Holm , and  Frances Conroy . ~ Mark Deming, All Movie Guide                              Cast       Leonardo DiCaprio  -  Howard Hughes Cate Blanchett  -  Katharine Hepburn Kate Beckinsale  -  Ava Gardner John C.

I probably haven't given this enough of a chance.  After all, so many have praised the genius of this film.  I just can't bring myself to watch it for some reason.  Got it from the bargain table at Blockbuster....  Perhaps you can take it off my hands and tell me how you liked it.

The Aviator follows Hughes (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) as the twentysomething millionaire, having already made a fortune improving the design of oil-drilling bits, comes to Hollywood with an interest in getting into the picture business. It doesn't take long for Hughes, with his passion for airplanes, to jump from producer to director of his first major film project, a World War I air epic called Hell's Angels, which took three years to complete thanks to the shift from silent to sound filming and Hughes' relentless perfectionism. However, the film was a massive hit, and the eccentric inventor became a mogul in Hollywood, making Jean Harlow (Gwen Stefani) a star and enjoying a romance with Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett). But Hollywood's old-boy network never fully accepted Hughes, and in time his passion for flying began to reclaim his attentions as he began designing new planes, setting air speed records, flying around the world, and risking his life testing aircraft. Hughes also found time to romance Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale) and founded his own airline, Trans-World Airlines, though as his ideas became bolder, his approach became more eccentric, and he gained many powerful enemies, including the head of Pan-American Airlines, Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin), and Senator Ralph Owen Brewster (Alan Alda), who attempted to prove that Hughes' radical design ideas were actually part of an effort to bilk taxpayers for millions of dollars through government contracts. The Aviator's star-studded cast also includes John C. Reilly, Jude Law, Willem Dafoe, Ian Holm, and Frances Conroy. ~ Mark Deming, All Movie Guide                             Complete Cast of The Aviator:           Leonardo DiCaprio   also in     Shutter Island  ,     Revolutionary Road  ,     Body of Lies  ,     The 11th Hour  ,     Blood Diamond  ,     The Departed     Cate Blanchett   also in     Elizabeth: The Golden Age  ,     Little Fish  ,     Veronica Guerin  ,     Heaven  ,     Charlotte Gray  ,     The Gift     Kate Beckinsale   also in     Nothing But the Truth  ,     Snow Angels  ,     Vacancy  ,     Underworld: Evolution  ,     Underworld  ,     Alice Through the Looking Glass     John C.

America would soon come to recognize Ron Howard as a lovable little kid on  The Andy Griffith Show  and later as a lovable teen on  Happy Days , two of the most popular shows in the history of television. But Howard wasn't content to be an actor; he had dreams      of directing. With a penchant for telling a good story, Ron Howard has been criticized for sometimes being too sentimental, but you can't fault him for having a heart -- and legions of movie fans prove that, sappy or not, Howard's heart is in the right place. Ron Howard hit box office gold with movie  Apollo 13 . 1.  Splash  (1984) Tom Hanks and Darryl Hannah star in this film about a young man in love with a mermaid.  Splash  made a bundle for Disney's new Touchstone division and was the studio's most successful live-action feature up to that time. Burgeoning star Hanks took the role of Allen (after it was turned down by John Travolta and Bill Murray),     then watched as it launched him as one of Hollywood's most popular stars. With Splash, Ron Howard proved his ability to warm audience's hearts while keeping them laughing. 2.  Cocoon  (1985) Hot on the heels of the mermaid love story, Ron Howard took on another seemingly too-bizarre-to-work plot and made a hit out of it. In 1985, audiences watched a bunch of elderly people discover the fountain of youth in a swimming pool occupied by  aliens . Not only did the uplifting movie go over well with audiences of all ages, the Academy saw an inspired performance by lead Don Ameche and gave him the Best Supporting Actor  Oscar  in 1986. Another Oscar went to the special effects team that worked on  Cocoon  -- incredibly enough, those misty, glowing aliens from the mid-1980s still hold up in today's world of computer-generated imaging.

The Aviator follows Hughes (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) as the twentysomething millionaire, having already made a fortune improving the design of oil-drilling bits, comes to Hollywood with an interest in getting into the picture business. It doesn't take long for Hughes, with his passion for airplanes, to jump from producer to director of his first major film project, a World War I air epic called Hell's Angels, which took three years to complete thanks to the shift from silent to sound filming and Hughes' relentless perfectionism. However, the film was a massive hit, and the eccentric inventor became a mogul in Hollywood, making Jean Harlow (Gwen Stefani) a star and enjoying a romance with Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett). But Hollywood's old-boy network never fully accepted Hughes, and in time his passion for flying began to reclaim his attentions as he began designing new planes, setting air speed records, flying around the world, and risking his life testing aircraft.

The Aviator follows Hughes (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) as the twentysomething millionaire, having already made a fortune improving the design of oil-drilling bits, comes to Hollywood with an interest in getting into the picture business. It doesn't take long for Hughes, with his passion for airplanes, to jump from producer to director of his first major film project, a World War I air epic called Hell's Angels, which took three years to complete thanks to the shift from silent to sound filming and Hughes' relentless perfectionism. However, the film was a massive hit, and the eccentric inventor became a mogul in Hollywood, making Jean Harlow (Gwen Stefani) a star and enjoying a romance with Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett). But Hollywood's old-boy network never fully accepted Hughes, and in time his passion for flying began to reclaim his attentions as he began designing new planes, setting air speed records, flying around the world, and risking his life testing aircraft.

His best friend and faithful employee Eddie Dupris is a former fighter who Frankie trained. In his last fight, Eddie suffered a severe injury, a fact that brings Frankie great guilt. One day, Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) enters Frankie's life, as well as his gym, and announces she needs a trainer. Frankie regards her as a dubious prospect, and isn't afraid to tell her why: he doesn't think much of women boxing, she's too old at 31, she lacks experience, and has no technique. However, Maggie sees boxing as the one part of her life that gives her meaning and won't give up easily. Finally won over by her determination, Frankie takes on Maggie, and as she slowly grows into a viable fighter, an emotional bond develops between them. When a tragedy befalls one of the three characters, each comes to a decision that shows how the relationships in the film have changed them. Adapted from a short story by F.X. Toole, a former corner man with years of experience in the fight game, Million Dollar Baby also stars Morgan Freeman, Anthony Mackie, and Mike Colter. ~ Mark Deming, All Movie Guide Read More Starring:  Clint Eastwood ,  Hilary Swank , ( more ) Format:  DVD |  See other available versions Million Dollar Baby Add to Cart 2004    PG13    Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) is a veteran boxing trainer who has devoted his life to the ring and has precious little to show for it; his daughter never answers his letters, and a fighter he's groomed into contender status has paid him back by signing with another manager, leaving Frankie high and dry.

The dialogue is spoken in the ancient Aramaic language, along with Latin and Hebrew. In the Garden of Gethsemane near the Mount of Olives, Jesus (James Caviezel) is betrayed by Judas Iscariot (Luca Lionello). Jesus is condemned to death for blasphemy and brought before Pontius Pilate (Hristo Naumov Shopov), the Roman governor of Judea, for sentencing. The roaring crowd demand his death, so Pilate orders his crucifixion. Jesus is severely beaten and made to carry his cross up to Golgotha, the hill outside Jerusalem, where he is nailed to the cross. Romanian theatrical actress Maia Morgenstern plays Mary, Mother of God, and Italian superstar Monica Bellucci plays Mary Magdalene. Amid much controversy involving Gibson and various religious organizations, The Passion of the Christ received an international theatrical release in February of 2004. In March 2005, Gibson released an unrated version of the film, dubbed The Passion Recut, that eliminated five to six minutes of the more graphic scenes of flogging and crucifixion. ~ Andrea LeVasseur, All Movie Guide Read More Starring:  James Caviezel ,  Monica Bellucci , ( more ) Format:  DVD |  See other available versions Fahrenheit 9/11 Add to Cart 2004    R    Directed by Michael Moore, whose aura of controversy only grew after his Oscar acceptance speech at the 2003 Academy Awards, Fahrenheit 9/11, like Moore's Bowling For Columbine and Roger & Me, promises to expose the corporate wrongdoings and big-money scandals perpetrated by America's financial elite. This movie, however, looks beyond the inner echelons of General Motors and Lockheed Martin in hopes of outing the evildoers in the White House, particularly in regards to the 43rd President of the United States, George W. Bush. In addition to criticizing the administration's handling of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the Pentagon and World Trade Center, Moore digs deep into the surprising relationship with the Bin Laden family held by both Bush administrations, and questions whether or not potential Saudi involvement with the attacks has been ignored. As Fahrenheit 9/11's Cannes Film Festival debut approached, marking only the second time in 48 years that a documentary has been included among the festival's main competition, Miramax's parent company Disney announced it would not be distributing the film due to its partisan nature, and, according to Moore, out of trepidation that the Florida-based Goliath's multi-million-dollar tax breaks might be negatively affected by Florida Governor Jeb Bush, whose review within Fahrenheit 9/11 is less than favorable. ~ Tracie Cooper, All Movie Guide Read More Format:  DVD |  See other available versions Collateral

For years, Ron Howard was known as Opie from ""The Andy Griffith Show"" and then as Richie from ""Happy Days."" Now he's known as one of Hollywood's most renowned filmmakers.  Howard has directed and produced more than 20 films and won an Academy Award for 2001's ""A Beautiful Mind.""  His newest project, ""Frost/Nixon,"" chronicles the interviews between British television host David Frost, played by Michael Sheen and President Richard Nixon, played by Frank Langella.   Bob Edwards talks with Ron Howard and Peter Morgan, who created the original stage play, and wrote the screenplay for the new film.  Howard says of the stage play by Morgan: ""I was surprised when I read the play, how riveting and entertaining this piece was. The interviews had meant a lot to me in 1977 -- I'd been one of those 400 million people around the world ... really watching and caring, and the outcome mattered a lot to me. But I had no idea [what] all the behind-the-scenes machinations meant, and what Peter Morgan discovered was [a] rich drama that was full of suspense, and humor and emotion, along with recreating this remarkable event."" ""It's two great characters in conflict, and everything about the story surprises, but underneath it is what makes great drama ... particularly the kind that yields fantastic performances, and as a director who really loves working with rich characters and the actors who can really maximize those characters, it was a field day for me. But everything about it is fresh, and original and really unexpected and that's harder and harder to come by."" Bob Edwards Weekend"" is a two-hour interview showcase, in which celebrated host Bob Edwards highlights the life and work of interesting people, from newsmakers, historians, and authors to artists, actors, and regular folks too.

When Paula introduces Sam to her parents they dispute their daughter's decision: they see Collins Hedgeworth ( Paul Linke ), the son of a wealthy family in the area, as her fiance. Paula's parents are rich as well and her father, Bigby Powers ( Barry Cahill ), is planning to run for  governor . They think Sam is marrying Paula for the money and call him a  fortune hunter , which Paula fiercely disputes.   Sam is thrown off the premises and Paula is sent to her room. She escapes through the window, steals her parents'  Rolls-Royce , picks up Sam and hits the road: this is the beginning of two runaway lovers in a wild explosive  car chase  and race towards Las Vegas. As news of their  elopement  spreads, several people start off after them to try and stop the fleeing couple.   Paula's father, Bigby Powers starts the chase by arranging his helicopter. Collins Hedgeworth leaves his stable and starts chasing his love interest like mad. When he calls to the TenQ radio station - to DJ Curly Q. Brown ( Don Steele ) - he offers a  USD $25,000 reward for the ones who can catch Paula and Sam. As a result the chase becomes more and more chaotic as many people along and on the road try to stop the couple in order to claim the reward. A number of cars are wrecked and stolen, and a subsequent reward of $25,000 is offered for Collins Hedgeworth, who is wanted by the police for  grand theft auto , after he stole a car.   With so many cars following them, Paula and Sam turn onto small, country roads to try and lose their pursuers. He wants to head somewhere else to get married, but she is set on a Vegas wedding. Paula's father makes an emotional appeal to her via telephone, but she refuses to listen to him. As they approach Las Vegas, Sam begins to have doubts about Paula's reasons for elopment, and questions whether she is genuinely motivated by affection for him or a desire to spite her father. She persuades him that she does want to marry him.   The chase is gaining increasing coverage in the  news media , with live cameras following the chase. The pursuing cars become involved in a  demolition derby , leading to a massive pile-up. The priceless Rolls Royce is totally destroyed, but Paula and Sam manage to escape. They eventually get married.     [ edit ]   Production   The film was made on a budget of $602,000. [ 1 ]  It was filmed in and around  Victorville ,  California .

Reviews Casting Insert Caption                CELEBRITY INTERVIEWS 5 Questions With: Ron Howard With an eclectic list of directorial triumphs --  'Parenthood,'   'Apollo 13'  and  'The Da Vinci Code,'  to name just a few -- on his resume and a pair of Academy Awards for 2001's  'A Beautiful Mind'  adorning his mantel,  Ron Howard  is back in the running for a couple more statues with his movie adaptation of  Peter Morgan's  acclaimed play  'Frost/Nixon.' Moviefone chatted with the accomplished director about the film, which chronicles the behind-the-scenes pyrotechnics surrounding the 1977 interviews between playboy TV host David Frost and disgraced ex-President Richard Nixon; about (finally!) bringing the beloved sitcom  'Arrested Development'  to the big screen; and about returning to his acting roots to reprise the iconic role of Richie Cunningham. 1. What compelled you to adapt  'Frost/Nixon' ? Was there something you felt a film would bring to the table that the stage version did not? Well, I saw what they discovered with the play was something that was so surprisingly entertaining and engrossing -- that it was one of those situations where you think you might know what happened but behind the scenes it's just so much more entertaining and involving than you'd ever imagined. And I felt that it was also a pretty cool era to evoke onscreen. And in a lot of ways, David Frost sort of embodied that -- his spirit, his energy, the whole globetrotting, freewheeling playboy celebrity that he was, among other things, during that time. I thought he was a really fresh character to center on and put into conflict with Richard Nixon.                   2. With a film that's anchored in fact but also incorporates some elements of fiction, there are bound to be some who say that you're taking liberties with history. What's your response to that? Is it all in the name of entertainment? Well, entertainment and insight. It's one of those things where the facts may not all be correct, but the truth is getting told. And I think, you know, it's an interpretation. It's mine. It's Peter Morgan, the writer's. It's the actors' interpretation of what we've come to understand about the events and the people surrounding those events. But even where there's creative license that has been taken, it's really been trying to make the story cohesive and engrossing and fun to watch, and also allowing the audience to understand a little bit better what really seemed to make these guys tick. 3. What was the coolest part about filming? The actual filming of the interviews was pretty intense because I was, as a director, trying to make it as immediate as possible so it's almost as if the audience is right there with these guys in the room and all those dramatic fireworks are going off. And these two actors [ Frank Langella  and  Michael Sheen ] were just, take after take, extraordinary. People would gather around the monitors where I'd be sitting watching the cameras and their jaws would drop. The work that these guys were doing -- what they understood about these characters -- was riveting. It was also very cool to shoot at the real Casa Pacifica, Nixon's Western White House. When you're in situations like that, it's almost like you're a kid that's snuck into the locker room at Yankee Stadium or something. You realize all the history, all the individuals -- individuals that you are depicting -- really lived, breathed and sorted out all their problems in that space in which you're filming now. It adds to the sense of responsibility. You also gain a lot of insight because around those environments are the people who knew the individuals that you're trying to dramatically depict. We picked up all kinds of great details that we could offer back to the audience. 4. What's the latest scoop on the 'Arrested Development' movie? There's no script. There's no start date. But I feel like there's this unified intention to do it and a real creative appetite to do it. I'm excited about it. And I know they've got a narrator standing by, that's for sure [laughs]. I'd [also] be one of the producers of the film. Mitch Hurwitz would write and direct and produce as well. I think it would be a happy reunion for the cast, who just loved the show and missed it from the moment it ended -- and a real great challenge for Mitch, who I think is going to wind up being a real great filmmaker. This is a great way to get him started. 5. You recently ""reprised"" your iconic roles as Richie Cunningham and Opie for a  FunnyorDie clip  encouraging people to vote. What was that like? Did it make you miss acting at all? [Laughs.] It reminded me that acting is hard work -- even doing that satirical, tongue-in-cheek Obama endorsement. It's a high-wire act whenever you get in front of the camera. It's one of the reasons I think I get along so well with actors -- they know that I really empathize with what they're trying to accomplish.

Country   United States       Language   English       Budget   $60,000,000       Gross revenue   $313,542,341       IMDb      Allmovie       A Beautiful Mind  is a  2001   American  film based on the life of  John Forbes Nash , a  Nobel Laureate in Economics . [ 2 ]  The film was directed by  Ron Howard  and written by  Akiva Goldsman . It was inspired by a bestselling,  Pulitzer Prize -nominated 1998  book of the same name  by  Sylvia Nasar . The film stars  Russell Crowe , along with  Jennifer Connelly ,  Ed Harris  and  Paul Bettany .   The story begins in the early years of Nash's life at  Princeton University  as he develops his ""original idea"" that will revolutionize the world of mathematics. Early in the movie, Nash begins developing  paranoid schizophrenia  and endures  delusional  episodes while painfully watching the loss and burden his condition brings on his wife and friends.   The film opened in US cinemas on December 21, 2001. It was well-received by critics, grossed over $300 million worldwide, and went on to win four  Academy Awards , including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actress. It was also nominated for Best Leading Actor, Best Editing, Best Makeup, and Best Score. The film has been criticized for its inaccurate portrayal of some aspects of Nash's life. The film fictionally portrayed his hallucinations as visual and auditory, yet factually they were exclusively auditory. Too, Nasar concluded Nash's refusal to take drugs ""may have been fortunate,"" since their  side effects  ""would have made his gentle re-entry into the world of mathematics a near impossibility""; in the screenplay, however, just before he receives the Nobel Prize, Nash speaks of taking ""newer medications.""

He is a recipient of the prestigious  Carnegie Prize  for  mathematics ; although he was promised a single room, his roommate Charles ( Paul Bettany ), a literature student, greets him as he moves in and soon becomes his best friend. Nash also meets a group of other promising math and science graduate students, Martin Hansen ( Josh Lucas ), Sol ( Adam Goldberg ), Ainsley, and Bender ( Anthony Rapp ), with whom he strikes up an awkward friendship. Nash admits to Charles that he is better with numbers than people, which comes as no surprise to them after watching his largely unsuccessful attempts at conversation with the women at the local bar.   The headmaster of Princeton informs Nash, who has missed many of his classes, that he cannot begin work until he finishes a thesis paper, prompting him to seek a truly original idea for the paper. A woman at the bar is what ultimately inspires his fruitful work in the concept of  governing dynamics , a theory in  mathematical economics .   After the conclusion of Nash's studies as a student at Princeton, he accepts a prestigious appointment at the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology  (MIT), along with his friends Sol and Bender.   Five years later, while teaching a class on calculus at MIT, he places a particularly interesting problem on the chalkboard that he dares his students to solve. When his student Alicia Larde ( Jennifer Connelly ) comes to his office to discuss the problem, the two fall in love and eventually marry.   On a return visit to Princeton, Nash runs into his former roommate Charles and meets Charles' young niece Marcee ( Vivien Cardone ), whom he adores. Nash is invited to a secret Department of Defense facility in  the Pentagon  to  crack  a complex  encryption  of an enemy telecommunication. Nash is able to decipher the code mentally, to the astonishment of other codebreakers. Here, he encounters the mysterious William Parcher ( Ed Harris ), who belongs to the  United States Department of Defense .   Parcher observes Nash's performance from above, while partially concealed behind a screen. Parcher gives Nash a new assignment to look for patterns in magazines and newspapers, ostensibly to thwart a  Soviet  plot. He must write a report of his findings and place them in a specified mailbox. After being chased by  Russian  agents and an exchange of gunfire, Nash becomes increasingly  paranoid  and begins to behave erratically.   After observing this erratic behavior, Alicia informs a  psychiatric hospital . Later, while delivering a guest lecture at Princeton University, Nash realizes that he is being watched by a hostile group of people; although, he attempts to flee, he is forcibly sedated and sent to a psychiatric facility. Nash's internment seemingly confirms his belief that the Soviets are trying to extract information from him. He views the officials of the  psychiatric facility  as Soviet kidnappers. At one point, he insanely tries to dig out of his arm an implant he received at  The Pentagon , causing much bleeding.   Alicia, desperate to help her husband, visits the mailbox and retrieves the never-opened ""top secret"" documents that Nash had delivered there. When confronted with this evidence, Nash is finally convinced that he has been  hallucinating . The Department of Defense agent William Parcher and Nash's secret assignment to decode Soviet messages was in fact all a  delusion . Even more surprisingly, Nash's friend Charles and his niece Marcee are also only products of Nash's mind.   After a series of  insulin shock therapy  sessions, Nash is released on the condition that he agrees to take  antipsychotic  medication; however, the drugs create  negative side-effects  that affect his sexual and emotional relationship with his wife and, most dramatically, his intellectual capacity. Frustrated, Nash secretly stops taking his medication and hoards his pills, triggering a relapse of his psychosis.   While bathing his infant son, Nash becomes distracted and wanders off. Alicia is hanging laundry in the backyard and observes that the back gate is open. She discovers that Nash has turned an abandoned shed in a nearby grove of trees into an office for his work for Parcher. Upon realizing what has happened, Alicia runs into the house to confront Nash and barely saves their child from drowning in the bathtub. When she confronts him, Nash claims that his friend Charles was watching their son. Alicia runs to the phone to call the psychiatric hospital for emergency assistance. Nash suddenly sees Parcher who urges him to kill his wife, but Nash angrily refuses to do such a thing. After Parcher points a gun at her, Nash lunges for him, accidentally knocking Alicia to the ground. Alicia flees the house in fear with their child, but Nash steps in front of her car to prevent her from leaving. After a moment, Nash realizes that Marcee is an hallucination, because although years have passed since their first encounter, Marcee has remained exactly the same age and is still a little girl. Realizing the implications of this fact, he tells Alicia, ""She never gets old."" Only then does he accept that although all three people seem completely real, they are in fact part of his hallucinations.   Caught between the intellectual paralysis of the  antipsychotic  drugs and his delusions, Nash and Alicia decide to try to live with his  abnormal condition . Nash consciously says goodbye to the three of them forever in his attempts to ignore his hallucinations and not feed ""his demons""; however, he thanks Charles for being his best friend over the years, and says a tearful goodbye to Marcee, stroking her hair and calling her ""baby girl"", telling them both he would not speak to them anymore. They still continue to haunt him, with Charles mocking him for cutting off their friendship, but Nash learns to ignore them.   Nash grows older and approaches his old friend and intellectual rival Martin Hansen, now head of the Princeton mathematics department, who grants him permission to work out of the library and audit classes. Even though Nash still suffers from hallucinations and mentions taking newer medications, he is ultimately able to live with and largely ignore his psychotic episodes. He takes his situation in stride and humorously checks to ensure that any new acquaintances are in fact real people, not hallucinations.   Nash eventually earns the privilege of teaching again. He is honored by his fellow professors for his achievement in mathematics, and goes on to win the  Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics  for his revolutionary work on  game theory . Nash and Alicia are about to leave the auditorium in Stockholm, when Nash sees Charles, Marcee and Parcher standing and watching him with blank expressions on their faces. Alicia asks Nash, ""What's wrong?"" Nash replies, ""Nothing. Nothing at all."" With that, they both leave the auditorium.     [ edit ]   Cast     Russell Crowe  as  John Forbes Nash . A mathematical genius who is obsessed with finding an original idea to ensure his legacy. There was difficulty when casting Crowe, who was well-liked by the producers, when he went to film  Gladiator  in a different time-zone and was difficult to reach for an extended period of time to attach him to the project. [ 4 ]   Jennifer Connelly  as  Alicia Nash . A later student of Nash who catches his interest. Connelly was cast after Ron Howard drew comparisons to her and Alicia Nash, both academically and in facial features. [ 4 ]   Paul Bettany  as  Charles Herman . Nash's cheerful, supportive roommate and best friend throughout graduate college. The character of Charles was not written to be  British ; however, director  Brian Helgeland  provided a tape of Bettany from  A Knight's Tale . The filmmakers agreed that the character could be British, based on Bettany's performance in the film. [ 5 ]   Ed Harris  as  William Parcher . A highly dedicated and forceful government agent for the Department of Defense. He recruits Nash to help fight Soviet spies.   Josh Lucas  as  Martin Hansen . Nash's rival from his graduate school years at Princeton.   Adam Goldberg  as  Sol . A friend of Nash's from Princeton University who is chosen, along with Bender, to work with him at MIT.   Anthony Rapp  as  Bender . A friend of Nash's from Princeton University who is chosen, along with Sol, to work with him at MIT.   Vivien Cardone  as  Marcee . Charles' young niece.   Christopher Plummer  as  Dr. Rosen . Nash's doctor at a psychiatric hospital.   Judd Hirsch  as  Helinger . The head of the Princeton mathematics department.       [ edit ]   Production   Producer  Brian Grazer  first read an excerpt of  Sylvia Nasar 's book  A Beautiful Mind  in  Vanity Fair . Grazer immediately purchased the rights to the film. He eventually brought the project to Ron Howard, who had scheduling conflicts and was forced to pass. Grazer later said that many  A-list  directors were calling with their point of view on the project. He eventually focused on a particular director, who coincidentally was only available at the same time Howard was available. Grazer was forced to make a decision and chose Howard. [ 6 ]   Grazer then met with a number of screenwriters, mostly consisting of ""serious dramatists"", but he chose  Akiva Goldsman  instead, because of his strong passion and desire for the project. Goldsman's creative take on the project was to not allow the viewers to understand that they are viewing an alternate reality until a specific point in the film. This was done to rob the viewers of their feelings in the same way that Nash himself was. Howard agreed to direct the film based only on the first draft. He then requested that Goldsman accentuate the love story aspect. [ 7 ]   Dave Bayer, a Barnard College Professor of Mathematics, was consulted on the mathematical equations that appear in the film. Bayer later stated that he approached his consulting role as an actor when preparing equations, such as when Nash is forced to teach a calculus class, and arbitrarily places a complicated problem on the blackboard. Bayer focused on a character who did not want to teach ordinary details and was more concerned with what was interesting. Bayer received a cameo role in the film as a professor that lays his pen down for Nash in the pen ceremony near the end of the film. [ 8 ]   Greg Cannom  was chosen to create the makeup effects for  A Beautiful Mind , specifically the age progression of the characters. Russell Crowe had previously worked with Cannom on  The Insider . Howard had also worked with Cannom on  Cocoon . Each character's stages of makeup were broken down by the number of years that would pass between levels. Cannom stressed subtlety between the stages, but worked toward the ultimate stage of ""Older Nash"". It was originally decided that the makeup department would merely age Russell Crowe throughout the film.; however, at Crowe's request, the makeup purposefully pulled Crowe's look towards the facial features of the real John Nash. Cannom developed a new silicone-type makeup that could simulate real skin and be used for overlapping applications, shortening the application time from eight hours to four hours. Crowe was also fitted with a number of dentures to give him a slight  overbite  throughout the film. [ 9 ]   Howard and Grazer chose frequent collaborator  James Horner  to score the film because of familiarity and his ability to communicate. Howard said, regarding Horner, ""It's like having a conversation with a writer or an actor or another director."" A running discussion between the director and the composer was the concept of high-level mathematics being less about numbers and solutions, and more akin to a  kaleidoscope , in that the ideas evolve and change. After the first screening of the film, Horner told Howard: ""I see changes occurring like fast-moving weather systems."" He chose it as another theme to connect to Nash's ever-changing character. Horner chose Welsh singer  Charlotte Church  to sing the soprano vocals after deciding that he needed a balance between a child and adult singing voice. He wanted a ""purity, clarity and brightness of an instrument"" but also a  vibrato  to maintain the humanity of the voice. [ 10 ]   The film was shot 90% chronologically. Three separate trips were made to the  Princeton University  campus. During filming, Howard decided that Nash's delusions should always first be introduced audibly and then visually. This not only provides a visual clue, but establishes the delusions from Nash's point of view. The real John Nash's delusions were also only auditory. A technique was also developed to visualize Nash's epiphanies. After speaking to a number of mathematicians who described it as ""the smoke clearing"", ""flashes of light"" and ""everything coming together"", the filmmakers decided upon a flash of light appearing over an object or person to signify Nash's creativity at work. [ 5 ]  Two night shots were done at  Fairleigh Dickinson University 's campus in Florham NJ, in the Vanderbilt Mansion ballroom  [2] .     [ edit ]   Release   A Beautiful Mind  received a limited release on December 21, 2001, receiving positive reviews. It was later released in America on January 4, 2002.  Rotten Tomatoes  showed a 78% approval rating among critics with a movie consensus stating ""The well-acted  A Beautiful Mind  is both a moving love story and a revealing look at mental illness."" [ 11 ]   Roger Ebert  gave the film four stars (his highest rating) in his Chicago Sun-Times review and, along with co-host  Richard Roeper  on the television show  Ebert & Roeper , gave the film a ""thumbs up"" rating. Roeper also stated ""this is one of the very best films of the year"". [ 12 ]  Mike Clark of USA Today gave three and a half out of four stars and also praised Crowe's performance and referred to as a welcomed follow up to Howard's previous film  The Grinch ; [ 13 ]  however, Desson Thomson of the  Washington Post  found the film to be ""one of those formulaically rendered Important Subject movies"", [ 11 ]  and Charles Taylor of  Salon Magazine  gave the film a scathing review, calling Crowe's performance ""the biggest load of hooey to stink up the screen this year"". [ 14 ]  The mathematics in the film were well-praised by the mathematics community, including the real John Nash. [ 8 ]   During the five-day weekend of the limited release,  A Beautiful Mind  opened at the twelfth spot at the  box office , [ 15 ]  peaking at the number two spot following the wide release. [ 16 ]  The film went to gross $170 million in North America and $313 million worldwide. [ 17 ]   Also in 2002, the film was awarded four  Academy Awards  for  Adapted Screenplay  ( Akiva Goldsman ),  Best Picture  ( Brian Grazer  and  Ron Howard ),  Directing  ( Ron Howard ), and  Supporting Actress  ( Jennifer Connelly ). It also received four other nominations for  Best Actor in a Leading Role  ( Russell Crowe ),  Film Editing  (Mike Hill and Daniel P. Hanley),  Best Makeup  (Greg Cannom and Colleen Callaghan), and  Original Music Score  ( James Horner ). [ 18 ]  The 2002  BAFTAs  awarded the film Best Actor and Best Actress to Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly, respectively. It also nominated the film for Best Film, Best Screenplay, and the David Lean Award for Direction. [ 19 ]  At the 2002  AFI Awards , Jennifer Connelly won for Best Featured Female Actor. [ 20 ]  The film was also nominated for Movie of the Year, Actor of the Year (Russell Crowe), and Screenwriter of the Year. [ 21 ]     [ edit ]   Accuracy   The narrative of the film differs considerably from the actual events of Nash's life. The film has been criticized for this, but the filmmakers had consistently said that the film was not meant to be a literal representation. [ 22 ]  One difficulty was in portraying stress and mental illness within one person's mind. [ 23 ]  Sylvia Nasar stated that the filmmakers ""invented a narrative that, while far from a literal telling, is true to the spirit of Nash's story"". [ 24 ]  The film made his hallucinations visual and auditory when, in fact, they were exclusively auditory. It is true that his handlers, both from faculty and administration, had to introduce him to assistants and strangers. [ 25 ] [ 5 ]  The  PBS  documentary  A Brilliant Madness  attempts to portray his life more accurately. [ 26 ]   The differences were substantial. Few if any of the characters in the film, besides John and Alicia Nash, corresponded directly to actual people. [ 27 ]  The discussion of the  Nash equilibrium  was criticized as over-simplified. In the film, schizophrenic hallucinations appeared while he was in graduate school, when in fact they did not show up until some years later. No mention is made of Nash's supposed homosexual experiences at  RAND , [ 24 ] [ 28 ]  which Nash and his wife both denied. [ 29 ]  Nash also fathered a son, John David Stier (born 19 June 1953), by Eleanor Agnes Stier (19212005), a nurse whom he abandoned when informed of her pregnancy. [ 30 ]   The movie also did not include Alicia's divorce of John in 1963. It was not until Nash won the Nobel Memorial Prize that they renewed their relationship, although she allowed him to live with her as a boarder beginning in 1970. They remarried in 2001. [ 31 ]    Nash is shown to join Wheeler Laboratory at MIT, but there is no such lab. He was appointed as C.L.E. Moore Instructor at MIT. [ 32 ]  The pen ceremony tradition at Princeton shown in the film is completely fictitious. [ 33 ] [ 5 ]  The film has Nash saying around the time of his Nobel prize in 1994: ""I take the newer medications"", when in fact Nash did not take any medication from 1970 onwards, something Nash's biography highlights. Howard later stated that they added the line of dialogue because it was felt as though the film was encouraging the notion that all schizophrenics can overcome their illness without medication. [ 5 ]  Nash also never gave an acceptance speech for his Nobel prize. [ 33 ]  Around the time of the Oscar nominations, Nash was accused of being  anti-semitic . Nash denied this and it was speculated that the accusation was designed to affect the votes inside the Academy Awards. [ 29 ]     [ edit ]   DVD release   A Beautiful Mind  was released on DVD in the United States on June 25, 2002 as a two-disc set. [ 34 ]  The first disc featured two separate audio commentaries from director Ron Howard and Akiva Goldsman, deleted scenes with optional commentary from the director, and production notes. The second disc included documentaries such as ""Inside A Beautiful Mind"" a making-of documentary, ""A Beautiful Partnership: Ron Howard and Brian Grazer"" detailing the partnership between the director and the producer, ""Development of the Screenplay"" discussing Akiva Goldsman scripting of the film, ""The Process of Age Progression"" detailing the makeup effects, ""Casting Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly"", ""Creation of the Special Effects"", ""Scoring the Film"", as well as ""Meeting John Nash"" displaying the real John Nash. Footage of the real John Nash accepting the Nobel Prize for Economics is also included along with reactions from the winners of the Academy Awards, storyboard comparisons, the theatrical trailer and an advertisement for the soundtrack to the film.

Robert Preston made his musical debut--both live and on film--as ""Professor"" Harold Hill, the upbeat charlatan who promises to teach a small-town boys band by the ""think system."" But it's the part Preston was born to play and the one for which he will always be best remembered. Composer Meredith Willson based  The Music Man  on his own small-town Midwestern boyhood, circa 1912, a quasi-mythical place where the old-maid librarian looks and sings like Shirley Jones. The boy himself is an adorable Ron Howard, lisp-singing ""Gary, Indiana."" Willson's entire score, featuring a combination of what are now standards, such as ""Goodnight My Someone"" and ""Till There Was You"" and show-specific numbers (""Trouble,"" ""76 Trombones""), is never less than infectious. This dazzling special edition is also as bright and sunny as any 4th of July in Iowa could ever hope to be.  --Robert Windeler             List Price:                    You Save:              Out of stock Product Details Actors: Robert Preston, Shirley Jones, Buddy Hackett, Hermione Gingold, Paul Ford Directors: Morton DaCosta, Scott Benson Format: Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, Original recording reissued, Special Edition, NTSC Language: English Number of Tapes: 1 Studio: Warner Home Video VHS Tape Release Date: September 19, 2000 Run Time: 177 minutes Average Customer Rating:  based on 176 reviews Customer Reviews Average Customer Review: Write an online review  and share your thoughts with other customers.   Music Man DVD      Dec 14, 2008 The product came on time and in great condition.  I was able to use it right away!  As far as musicals go, this is a classic!  I would reccommend purchasing it if you are feeling hesitant! 0 of 1 found the following review helpful: The Music Man      Oct 30, 2008 I missed the original movie, am going to watch this when a neighbor returns.  We enjoy viewing movies at home once or twice a month. Poor DVD quality      Oct 01, 2008 The first and last thirds of the movie are Ok -- not great quality -- but the middle third hangs up time after time.  You must fast forward to get it past the ""bad spot"" and then resume watching.  But you can't go back and watch or listen to the piece that you've missed or it hangs up (freezes) again. A great musical!      Sep 18, 2008 This is a great movie.  I got my husband to watch it with me and he couldn't believe how much fun it was.  Give it a try.  You won't regret it. 0 of 2 found the following review helpful: Pretty poor CD      Sep 16, 2008 CD worked for half the movie then nothing.  Repeated attempts to play were fruitless.

[ 2 ]  The film was directed by  Ron Howard  and written by  Akiva Goldsman . It was inspired by a bestselling,  Pulitzer Prize -nominated 1998  book of the same name  by  Sylvia Nasar . The film stars  Russell Crowe , along with  Jennifer Connelly ,  Ed Harris  and  Paul Bettany .   The story begins in the early years of Nash's life at  Princeton University  as he develops his ""original idea"" that will revolutionize the world of mathematics. Early in the movie, Nash begins developing  paranoid schizophrenia  and endures  delusional  episodes while painfully watching the loss and burden his condition brings on his wife and friends.   The film opened in US cinemas on December 21, 2001. It was well-received by critics, grossed over $300 million worldwide, and went on to win four  Academy Awards , including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actress. It was also nominated for Best Leading Actor, Best Editing, Best Makeup, and Best Score. The film has been criticized for its inaccurate portrayal of some aspects of Nash's life. The film fictionally portrayed his hallucinations as visual and auditory, yet factually they were exclusively auditory. Too, Nasar concluded Nash's refusal to take drugs ""may have been fortunate,"" since their  side effects  ""would have made his gentle re-entry into the world of mathematics a near impossibility""; in the screenplay, however, just before he receives the Nobel Prize, Nash speaks of taking ""newer medications.""

He is a recipient of the prestigious  Carnegie Prize  for  mathematics ; although he was promised a single room, his roommate Charles ( Paul Bettany ), a literature student, greets him as he moves in and soon becomes his best friend. Nash also meets a group of other promising math and science graduate students, Martin Hansen ( Josh Lucas ), Sol ( Adam Goldberg ), Ainsley, and Bender ( Anthony Rapp ), with whom he strikes up an awkward friendship. Nash admits to Charles that he is better with numbers than people, which comes as no surprise to them after watching his largely unsuccessful attempts at conversation with the women at the local bar.   The headmaster of Princeton informs Nash, who has missed many of his classes, that he cannot begin work until he finishes a thesis paper, prompting him to seek a truly original idea for the paper. A woman at the bar is what ultimately inspires his fruitful work in the concept of  governing dynamics , a theory in  mathematical economics .   After the conclusion of Nash's studies as a student at Princeton, he accepts a prestigious appointment at the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology  (MIT), along with his friends Sol and Bender.   Five years later, while teaching a class on calculus at MIT, he places a particularly interesting problem on the chalkboard that he dares his students to solve. When his student Alicia Larde ( Jennifer Connelly ) comes to his office to discuss the problem, the two fall in love and eventually marry.   On a return visit to Princeton, Nash runs into his former roommate Charles and meets Charles' young niece Marcee ( Vivien Cardone ), whom he adores. Nash is invited to a secret Department of Defense facility in  the Pentagon  to  crack  a complex  encryption  of an enemy telecommunication. Nash is able to decipher the code mentally, to the astonishment of other codebreakers. Here, he encounters the mysterious William Parcher ( Ed Harris ), who belongs to the  United States Department of Defense .   Parcher observes Nash's performance from above, while partially concealed behind a screen. Parcher gives Nash a new assignment to look for patterns in magazines and newspapers, ostensibly to thwart a  Soviet  plot. He must write a report of his findings and place them in a specified mailbox. After being chased by  Russian  agents and an exchange of gunfire, Nash becomes increasingly  paranoid  and begins to behave erratically.   After observing this erratic behavior, Alicia informs a  psychiatric hospital . Later, while delivering a guest lecture at Princeton University, Nash realizes that he is being watched by a hostile group of people; although, he attempts to flee, he is forcibly sedated and sent to a psychiatric facility. Nash's internment seemingly confirms his belief that the Soviets are trying to extract information from him. He views the officials of the  psychiatric facility  as Soviet kidnappers. At one point, he insanely tries to dig out of his arm an implant he received at  The Pentagon , causing much bleeding.   Alicia, desperate to help her husband, visits the mailbox and retrieves the never-opened ""top secret"" documents that Nash had delivered there. When confronted with this evidence, Nash is finally convinced that he has been  hallucinating . The Department of Defense agent William Parcher and Nash's secret assignment to decode Soviet messages was in fact all a  delusion . Even more surprisingly, Nash's friend Charles and his niece Marcee are also only products of Nash's mind.   After a series of  insulin shock therapy  sessions, Nash is released on the condition that he agrees to take  antipsychotic  medication; however, the drugs create  negative side-effects  that affect his sexual and emotional relationship with his wife and, most dramatically, his intellectual capacity. Frustrated, Nash secretly stops taking his medication and hoards his pills, triggering a relapse of his psychosis.   While bathing his infant son, Nash becomes distracted and wanders off. Alicia is hanging laundry in the backyard and observes that the back gate is open. She discovers that Nash has turned an abandoned shed in a nearby grove of trees into an office for his work for Parcher. Upon realizing what has happened, Alicia runs into the house to confront Nash and barely saves their child from drowning in the bathtub. When she confronts him, Nash claims that his friend Charles was watching their son. Alicia runs to the phone to call the psychiatric hospital for emergency assistance. Nash suddenly sees Parcher who urges him to kill his wife, but Nash angrily refuses to do such a thing. After Parcher points a gun at her, Nash lunges for him, accidentally knocking Alicia to the ground. Alicia flees the house in fear with their child, but Nash steps in front of her car to prevent her from leaving. After a moment, Nash realizes that Marcee is a hallucination, because although years have passed since their first encounter, Marcee has remained exactly the same age and is still a little girl. Realizing the implications of this fact, he tells Alicia, ""She never gets old."" Only then does he accept that although all three people seem completely real, they are in fact part of his hallucinations.   Caught between the intellectual paralysis of the  antipsychotic  drugs and his delusions, Nash and Alicia decide to try to live with his  abnormal condition . Nash consciously says goodbye to the three of them forever in his attempts to ignore his hallucinations and not feed ""his demons""; however, he thanks Charles for being his best friend over the years, and says a tearful goodbye to Marcee, stroking her hair and calling her ""baby girl"", telling them both he would not speak to them anymore. They still continue to haunt him, with Charles mocking him for cutting off their friendship, but Nash learns to ignore them.   Nash grows older and approaches his old friend and intellectual rival Martin Hansen, now head of the Princeton mathematics department, who grants him permission to work out of the library and audit classes. Even though Nash still suffers from hallucinations and mentions taking newer medications, he is ultimately able to live with and largely ignore his psychotic episodes. He takes his situation in stride and humorously checks to ensure that any new acquaintances are in fact real people, not hallucinations.   Nash eventually earns the privilege of teaching again. He is honored by his fellow professors for his achievement in mathematics, and goes on to win the  Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics  for his revolutionary work on  game theory . Nash and Alicia are about to leave the auditorium in Stockholm, when Nash sees Charles, Marcee and Parcher standing and watching him with blank expressions on their faces. Alicia asks Nash, ""What's wrong?"" Nash replies, ""Nothing. Nothing at all."" With that, they both leave the auditorium.     [ edit ]   Cast     Russell Crowe  as  John Forbes Nash . A mathematical genius who is obsessed with finding an original idea to ensure his legacy. There was difficulty when casting Crowe, who was well-liked by the producers, when he went to film  Gladiator  in a different time-zone and was difficult to reach for an extended period of time to attach him to the project. [ 4 ]   Jennifer Connelly  as  Alicia Nash . A later student of Nash who catches his interest. Connelly was cast after Ron Howard drew comparisons to her and Alicia Nash, both academically and in facial features. [ 4 ]   Paul Bettany  as  Charles Herman . Nash's cheerful, supportive roommate and best friend throughout graduate college. The character of Charles was not written to be  British ; however, director  Brian Helgeland  provided a tape of Bettany from  A Knight's Tale . The filmmakers agreed that the character could be British, based on Bettany's performance in the film. [ 5 ]   Ed Harris  as  William Parcher . A highly dedicated and forceful government agent for the Department of Defense. He recruits Nash to help fight Soviet spies.   Josh Lucas  as  Martin Hansen . Nash's rival from his graduate school years at Princeton.   Adam Goldberg  as  Sol . A friend of Nash's from Princeton University who is chosen, along with Bender, to work with him at MIT.   Anthony Rapp  as  Bender . A friend of Nash's from Princeton University who is chosen, along with Sol, to work with him at MIT.   Vivien Cardone  as  Marcee . Charles' young niece.   Christopher Plummer  as  Dr. Rosen . Nash's doctor at a psychiatric hospital.   Judd Hirsch  as  Helinger . The head of the Princeton mathematics department.       [ edit ]   Production   Producer  Brian Grazer  first read an excerpt of  Sylvia Nasar 's book  A Beautiful Mind  in  Vanity Fair . Grazer immediately purchased the rights to the film. He eventually brought the project to Ron Howard, who had scheduling conflicts and was forced to pass. Grazer later said that many  A-list  directors were calling with their point of view on the project. He eventually focused on a particular director, who coincidentally was only available at the same time Howard was available. Grazer was forced to make a decision and chose Howard. [ 6 ]   Grazer then met with a number of screenwriters, mostly consisting of ""serious dramatists"", but he chose  Akiva Goldsman  instead, because of his strong passion and desire for the project. Goldsman's creative take on the project was to not allow the viewers to understand that they are viewing an alternate reality until a specific point in the film. This was done to rob the viewers of their feelings in the same way that Nash himself was. Howard agreed to direct the film based only on the first draft. He then requested that Goldsman accentuate the love story aspect. [ 7 ]   Dave Bayer, a Barnard College Professor of Mathematics, was consulted on the mathematical equations that appear in the film. Bayer later stated that he approached his consulting role as an actor when preparing equations, such as when Nash is forced to teach a calculus class, and arbitrarily places a complicated problem on the blackboard. Bayer focused on a character who did not want to teach ordinary details and was more concerned with what was interesting. Bayer received a cameo role in the film as a professor that lays his pen down for Nash in the pen ceremony near the end of the film. [ 8 ]   Greg Cannom  was chosen to create the makeup effects for  A Beautiful Mind , specifically the age progression of the characters. Russell Crowe had previously worked with Cannom on  The Insider . Howard had also worked with Cannom on  Cocoon . Each character's stages of makeup were broken down by the number of years that would pass between levels. Cannom stressed subtlety between the stages, but worked toward the ultimate stage of ""Older Nash"". It was originally decided that the makeup department would merely age Russell Crowe throughout the film.; however, at Crowe's request, the makeup purposefully pulled Crowe's look towards the facial features of the real John Nash. Cannom developed a new silicone-type makeup that could simulate real skin and be used for overlapping applications, shortening the application time from eight hours to four hours. Crowe was also fitted with a number of dentures to give him a slight  overbite  throughout the film. [ 9 ]   Howard and Grazer chose frequent collaborator  James Horner  to score the film because of familiarity and his ability to communicate. Howard said, regarding Horner, ""It's like having a conversation with a writer or an actor or another director."" A running discussion between the director and the composer was the concept of high-level mathematics being less about numbers and solutions, and more akin to a  kaleidoscope , in that the ideas evolve and change. After the first screening of the film, Horner told Howard: ""I see changes occurring like fast-moving weather systems."" He chose it as another theme to connect to Nash's ever-changing character. Horner chose Welsh singer  Charlotte Church  to sing the soprano vocals after deciding that he needed a balance between a child and adult singing voice. He wanted a ""purity, clarity and brightness of an instrument"" but also a  vibrato  to maintain the humanity of the voice. [ 10 ]   The film was shot 90% chronologically. Three separate trips were made to the  Princeton University  campus. During filming, Howard decided that Nash's delusions should always first be introduced audibly and then visually. This not only provides a visual clue, but establishes the delusions from Nash's point of view. The real John Nash's delusions were also only auditory. A technique was also developed to visualize Nash's epiphanies. After speaking to a number of mathematicians who described it as ""the smoke clearing"", ""flashes of light"" and ""everything coming together"", the filmmakers decided upon a flash of light appearing over an object or person to signify Nash's creativity at work. [ 5 ]  Two night shots were done at  Fairleigh Dickinson University 's campus in Florham NJ, in the Vanderbilt Mansion ballroom  [2] .     [ edit ]   Release   A Beautiful Mind  received a limited release on December 21, 2001, receiving positive reviews. It was later released in America on January 4, 2002.  Rotten Tomatoes  showed a 78% approval rating among critics with a movie consensus stating ""The well-acted  A Beautiful Mind  is both a moving love story and a revealing look at mental illness."" [ 11 ]   Roger Ebert  gave the film four stars (his highest rating) in his Chicago Sun-Times review and, along with co-host  Richard Roeper  on the television show  Ebert & Roeper , gave the film a ""thumbs up"" rating. Roeper also stated ""this is one of the very best films of the year"". [ 12 ]  Mike Clark of USA Today gave three and a half out of four stars and also praised Crowe's performance and referred to as a welcomed follow up to Howard's previous film  The Grinch ; [ 13 ]  however, Desson Thomson of the  Washington Post  found the film to be ""one of those formulaically rendered Important Subject movies"", [ 11 ]  and Charles Taylor of  Salon Magazine  gave the film a scathing review, calling Crowe's performance ""the biggest load of hooey to stink up the screen this year"". [ 14 ]  The mathematics in the film were well-praised by the mathematics community, including the real John Nash. [ 8 ]   During the five-day weekend of the limited release,  A Beautiful Mind  opened at the twelfth spot at the  box office , [ 15 ]  peaking at the number two spot following the wide release. [ 16 ]  The film went to gross $170 million in North America and $313 million worldwide. [ 17 ]   Also in 2002, the film was awarded four  Academy Awards  for  Adapted Screenplay  ( Akiva Goldsman ),  Best Picture  ( Brian Grazer  and  Ron Howard ),  Directing  ( Ron Howard ), and  Supporting Actress  ( Jennifer Connelly ). It also received four other nominations for  Best Actor in a Leading Role  ( Russell Crowe ),  Film Editing  (Mike Hill and Daniel P. Hanley),  Best Makeup  (Greg Cannom and Colleen Callaghan), and  Original Music Score  ( James Horner ). [ 18 ]  The 2002  BAFTAs  awarded the film Best Actor and Best Actress to Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly, respectively. It also nominated the film for Best Film, Best Screenplay, and the David Lean Award for Direction. [ 19 ]  At the 2002  AFI Awards , Jennifer Connelly won for Best Featured Female Actor. [ 20 ]  The film was also nominated for Movie of the Year, Actor of the Year (Russell Crowe), and Screenwriter of the Year. [ 21 ]     [ edit ]   Accuracy   The narrative of the film differs considerably from the actual events of Nash's life. The film has been criticized for this, but the filmmakers had consistently said that the film was not meant to be a literal representation. [ 22 ]  One difficulty was in portraying stress and mental illness within one person's mind. [ 23 ]  Sylvia Nasar stated that the filmmakers ""invented a narrative that, while far from a literal telling, is true to the spirit of Nash's story"". [ 24 ]  The film made his hallucinations visual and auditory when, in fact, they were exclusively auditory. It is true that his handlers, both from faculty and administration, had to introduce him to assistants and strangers. [ 25 ] [ 5 ]  The  PBS  documentary  A Brilliant Madness  attempts to portray his life more accurately. [ 26 ]   The differences were substantial. Few if any of the characters in the film, besides John and Alicia Nash, corresponded directly to actual people. [ 27 ]  The discussion of the  Nash equilibrium  was criticized as over-simplified. In the film, schizophrenic hallucinations appeared while he was in graduate school, when in fact they did not show up until some years later. No mention is made of Nash's supposed homosexual experiences at  RAND , [ 24 ] [ 28 ]  which Nash and his wife both denied. [ 29 ]  Nash also fathered a son, John David Stier (born 19 June 1953), by Eleanor Agnes Stier (19212005), a nurse whom he abandoned when informed of her pregnancy. [ 30 ]   The movie also did not include Alicia's divorce of John in 1963. It was not until Nash won the Nobel Memorial Prize that they renewed their relationship, although she allowed him to live with her as a boarder beginning in 1970. They remarried in 2001. [ 31 ]    Nash is shown to join Wheeler Laboratory at MIT, but there is no such lab. He was appointed as C.L.E. Moore Instructor at MIT. [ 32 ]  The pen ceremony tradition at Princeton shown in the film is completely fictitious. [ 33 ] [ 5 ]  The film has Nash saying around the time of his Nobel prize in 1994: ""I take the newer medications"", when in fact Nash did not take any medication from 1970 onwards, something Nash's biography highlights. Howard later stated that they added the line of dialogue because it was felt as though the film was encouraging the notion that all schizophrenics can overcome their illness without medication. [ 5 ]  Nash also never gave an acceptance speech for his Nobel prize. [ 33 ]  Around the time of the Oscar nominations, Nash was accused of being  anti-semitic . Nash denied this and it was speculated that the accusation was designed to affect the votes inside the Academy Awards. [ 29 ]     [ edit ]   DVD release   A Beautiful Mind  was released on DVD in the United States on June 25, 2002 as a two-disc set. [ 34 ]  The first disc featured two separate audio commentaries from director Ron Howard and Akiva Goldsman, deleted scenes with optional commentary from the director, and production notes. The second disc included documentaries such as ""Inside A Beautiful Mind"" a making-of documentary, ""A Beautiful Partnership: Ron Howard and Brian Grazer"" detailing the partnership between the director and the producer, ""Development of the Screenplay"" discussing Akiva Goldsman scripting of the film, ""The Process of Age Progression"" detailing the makeup effects, ""Casting Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly"", ""Creation of the Special Effects"", ""Scoring the Film"", as well as ""Meeting John Nash"" displaying the real John Nash. Footage of the real John Nash accepting the Nobel Prize for Economics is also included along with reactions from the winners of the Academy Awards, storyboard comparisons, the theatrical trailer and an advertisement for the soundtrack to the film.

[ 2 ]  The film was directed by  Ron Howard  and written by  Akiva Goldsman . It was inspired by a bestselling,  Pulitzer Prize -nominated 1998  book of the same name  by  Sylvia Nasar . The film stars  Russell Crowe , along with  Jennifer Connelly ,  Ed Harris  and  Paul Bettany .   The story begins in the early years of Nash's life at  Princeton University  as he develops his ""original idea"" that will revolutionize the world of mathematics. Early in the movie, Nash begins developing  paranoid schizophrenia  and endures  delusional  episodes while painfully watching the loss and burden his condition brings on his wife and friends.   The film opened in US cinemas on December 21, 2001. It was well-received by critics, grossed over $300 million worldwide, and went on to win four  Academy Awards , including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actress. It was also nominated for Best Leading Actor, Best Editing, Best Makeup, and Best Score. The film has been criticized for its inaccurate portrayal of some aspects of Nash's life. The film fictionally portrayed his hallucinations as visual and auditory, yet factually they were exclusively auditory. Too, Nasar concluded Nash's refusal to take drugs ""may have been fortunate,"" since their  side effects  ""would have made his gentle re-entry into the world of mathematics a near impossibility""; in the screenplay, however, just before he receives the Nobel Prize, Nash speaks of taking ""newer medications."" [ 3 ]           Contents       1   Plot   2   Cast   3   Production   4   Release   5   Accuracy   6   DVD release   7   See also   8   References     8.1   Additional reading       9   External links               [ edit ]   Plot   John Nash  ( Russell Crowe ) arrives at  Princeton University  as a new graduate student. He is a recipient of the prestigious  Carnegie Prize  for  mathematics ; although he was promised a single room, his roommate Charles ( Paul Bettany ), a literature student, greets him as he moves in and soon becomes his best friend. Nash also meets a group of other promising math and science graduate students, Martin Hansen ( Josh Lucas ), Sol ( Adam Goldberg ), Ainsley, and Bender ( Anthony Rapp ), with whom he strikes up an awkward friendship. Nash admits to Charles that he is better with numbers than people, which comes as no surprise to them after watching his largely unsuccessful attempts at conversation with the women at the local bar.   The headmaster of Princeton informs Nash, who has missed many of his classes, that he cannot begin work until he finishes a thesis paper, prompting him to seek a truly original idea for the paper. A woman at the bar is what ultimately inspires his fruitful work in the concept of  governing dynamics , a theory in  mathematical economics .   After the conclusion of Nash's studies as a student at Princeton, he accepts a prestigious appointment at the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology  (MIT), along with his friends Sol and Bender.   Five years later, while teaching a class on calculus at MIT, he places a particularly interesting problem on the chalkboard that he dares his students to solve. When his student Alicia Larde ( Jennifer Connelly ) comes to his office to discuss the problem, the two fall in love and eventually marry.   On a return visit to Princeton, Nash runs into his former roommate Charles and meets Charles' young niece Marcee ( Vivien Cardone ), whom he adores. Nash is invited to a secret Department of Defense facility in  the Pentagon  to  crack  a complex  encryption  of an enemy telecommunication. Nash is able to decipher the code mentally, to the astonishment of other codebreakers. Here, he encounters the mysterious William Parcher ( Ed Harris ), who belongs to the  United States Department of Defense .   Parcher observes Nash's performance from above, while partially concealed behind a screen. Parcher gives Nash a new assignment to look for patterns in magazines and newspapers, ostensibly to thwart a  Soviet  plot. He must write a report of his findings and place them in a specified mailbox. After being chased by  Russian  agents and an exchange of gunfire, Nash becomes increasingly  paranoid  and begins to behave erratically.   After observing this erratic behavior, Alicia informs a  psychiatric hospital . Later, while delivering a guest lecture at Princeton University, Nash realizes that he is being watched by a hostile group of people; although, he attempts to flee, he is forcibly sedated and sent to a psychiatric facility. Nash's internment seemingly confirms his belief that the Soviets are trying to extract information from him. He views the officials of the  psychiatric facility  as Soviet kidnappers. At one point, he insanely tries to dig out of his arm an implant he received at  The Pentagon , causing much bleeding.   Alicia, desperate to help her husband, visits the mailbox and retrieves the never-opened ""top secret"" documents that Nash had delivered there. When confronted with this evidence, Nash is finally convinced that he has been  hallucinating . The Department of Defense agent William Parcher and Nash's secret assignment to decode Soviet messages was in fact all a  delusion . Even more surprisingly, Nash's friend Charles and his niece Marcee are also only products of Nash's mind.   After a series of  insulin shock therapy  sessions, Nash is released on the condition that he agrees to take  antipsychotic  medication; however, the drugs create  negative side-effects  that affect his sexual and emotional relationship with his wife and, most dramatically, his intellectual capacity. Frustrated, Nash secretly stops taking his medication and hoards his pills, triggering a relapse of his psychosis.   While bathing his infant son, Nash becomes distracted and wanders off. Alicia is hanging laundry in the backyard and observes that the back gate is open. She discovers that Nash has turned an abandoned shed in a nearby grove of trees into an office for his work for Parcher. Upon realizing what has happened, Alicia runs into the house to confront Nash and barely saves their child from drowning in the bathtub. When she confronts him, Nash claims that his friend Charles was watching their son. Alicia runs to the phone to call the psychiatric hospital for emergency assistance. Nash suddenly sees Parcher who urges him to kill his wife, but Nash angrily refuses to do such a thing. After Parcher points a gun at her, Nash lunges for him, accidentally knocking Alicia to the ground. Alicia flees the house in fear with their child, but Nash steps in front of her car to prevent her from leaving. After a moment, Nash realizes that Marcee is an hallucination, because although years have passed since their first encounter, Marcee has remained exactly the same age and is still a little girl. Realizing the implications of this fact, he tells Alicia, ""She never gets old."" Only then does he accept that although all three people seem completely real, they are in fact part of his hallucinations.   Caught between the intellectual paralysis of the  antipsychotic  drugs and his delusions, Nash and Alicia decide to try to live with his  abnormal condition . Nash consciously says goodbye to the three of them forever in his attempts to ignore his hallucinations and not feed ""his demons""; however, he thanks Charles for being his best friend over the years, and says a tearful goodbye to Marcee, stroking her hair and calling her ""baby girl"", telling them both he would not speak to them anymore. They still continue to haunt him, with Charles mocking him for cutting off their friendship, but Nash learns to ignore them.   Nash grows older and approaches his old friend and intellectual rival Martin Hansen, now head of the Princeton mathematics department, who grants him permission to work out of the library and audit classes. Even though Nash still suffers from hallucinations and mentions taking newer medications, he is ultimately able to live with and largely ignore his psychotic episodes. He takes his situation in stride and humorously checks to ensure that any new acquaintances are in fact real people, not hallucinations.   Nash eventually earns the privilege of teaching again. He is honored by his fellow professors for his achievement in mathematics, and goes on to win the  Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics  for his revolutionary work on  game theory . Nash and Alicia are about to leave the auditorium in Stockholm, when Nash sees Charles, Marcee and Parcher standing and watching him with blank expressions on their faces. Alicia asks Nash, ""What's wrong?"" Nash replies, ""Nothing. Nothing at all."" With that, they both leave the auditorium.     [ edit ]   Cast     Russell Crowe  as  John Forbes Nash . A mathematical genius who is obsessed with finding an original idea to ensure his legacy. There was difficulty when casting Crowe, who was well-liked by the producers, when he went to film  Gladiator  in a different time-zone and was difficult to reach for an extended period of time to attach him to the project. [ 4 ]   Jennifer Connelly  as  Alicia Nash . A later student of Nash who catches his interest. Connelly was cast after Ron Howard drew comparisons to her and Alicia Nash, both academically and in facial features. [ 4 ]   Paul Bettany  as  Charles Herman . Nash's cheerful, supportive roommate and best friend throughout graduate college. The character of Charles was not written to be  British ; however, director  Brian Helgeland  provided a tape of Bettany from  A Knight's Tale . The filmmakers agreed that the character could be British, based on Bettany's performance in the film. [ 5 ]   Ed Harris  as  William Parcher . A highly dedicated and forceful government agent for the Department of Defense. He recruits Nash to help fight Soviet spies.   Josh Lucas  as  Martin Hansen . Nash's rival from his graduate school years at Princeton.   Adam Goldberg  as  Sol . A friend of Nash's from Princeton University who is chosen, along with Bender, to work with him at MIT.   Anthony Rapp  as  Bender . A friend of Nash's from Princeton University who is chosen, along with Sol, to work with him at MIT.   Vivien Cardone  as  Marcee . Charles' young niece.   Christopher Plummer  as  Dr. Rosen . Nash's doctor at a psychiatric hospital.   Judd Hirsch  as  Helinger . The head of the Princeton mathematics department.       [ edit ]   Production   Producer  Brian Grazer  first read an excerpt of  Sylvia Nasar 's book  A Beautiful Mind  in  Vanity Fair . Grazer immediately purchased the rights to the film. He eventually brought the project to Ron Howard, who had scheduling conflicts and was forced to pass. Grazer later said that many  A-list  directors were calling with their point of view on the project. He eventually focused on a particular director, who coincidentally was only available at the same time Howard was available. Grazer was forced to make a decision and chose Howard. [ 6 ]   Grazer then met with a number of screenwriters, mostly consisting of ""serious dramatists"", but he chose  Akiva Goldsman  instead, because of his strong passion and desire for the project. Goldsman's creative take on the project was to not allow the viewers to understand that they are viewing an alternate reality until a specific point in the film. This was done to rob the viewers of their feelings in the same way that Nash himself was. Howard agreed to direct the film based only on the first draft. He then requested that Goldsman accentuate the love story aspect. [ 7 ]   Dave Bayer, a Barnard College Professor of Mathematics, was consulted on the mathematical equations that appear in the film. Bayer later stated that he approached his consulting role as an actor when preparing equations, such as when Nash is forced to teach a calculus class, and arbitrarily places a complicated problem on the blackboard. Bayer focused on a character who did not want to teach ordinary details and was more concerned with what was interesting. Bayer received a cameo role in the film as a professor that lays his pen down for Nash in the pen ceremony near the end of the film. [ 8 ]   Greg Cannom  was chosen to create the makeup effects for  A Beautiful Mind , specifically the age progression of the characters. Russell Crowe had previously worked with Cannom on  The Insider . Howard had also worked with Cannom on  Cocoon . Each character's stages of makeup were broken down by the number of years that would pass between levels. Cannom stressed subtlety between the stages, but worked toward the ultimate stage of ""Older Nash"". It was originally decided that the makeup department would merely age Russell Crowe throughout the film.; however, at Crowe's request, the makeup purposefully pulled Crowe's look towards the facial features of the real John Nash. Cannom developed a new silicone-type makeup that could simulate real skin and be used for overlapping applications, shortening the application time from eight hours to four hours. Crowe was also fitted with a number of dentures to give him a slight  overbite  throughout the film. [ 9 ]   Howard and Grazer chose frequent collaborator  James Horner  to score the film because of familiarity and his ability to communicate. Howard said, regarding Horner, ""It's like having a conversation with a writer or an actor or another director."" A running discussion between the director and the composer was the concept of high-level mathematics being less about numbers and solutions, and more akin to a  kaleidoscope , in that the ideas evolve and change. After the first screening of the film, Horner told Howard: ""I see changes occurring like fast-moving weather systems."" He chose it as another theme to connect to Nash's ever-changing character. Horner chose Welsh singer  Charlotte Church  to sing the soprano vocals after deciding that he needed a balance between a child and adult singing voice. He wanted a ""purity, clarity and brightness of an instrument"" but also a  vibrato  to maintain the humanity of the voice. [ 10 ]   The film was shot 90% chronologically. Three separate trips were made to the  Princeton University  campus. During filming, Howard decided that Nash's delusions should always first be introduced audibly and then visually. This not only provides a visual clue, but establishes the delusions from Nash's point of view. The real John Nash's delusions were also only auditory. A technique was also developed to visualize Nash's epiphanies. After speaking to a number of mathematicians who described it as ""the smoke clearing"", ""flashes of light"" and ""everything coming together"", the filmmakers decided upon a flash of light appearing over an object or person to signify Nash's creativity at work. [ 5 ]  Two night shots were done at  Fairleigh Dickinson University 's campus in Florham NJ, in the Vanderbilt Mansion ballroom  [2] .     [ edit ]   Release   A Beautiful Mind  received a limited release on December 21, 2001, receiving positive reviews. It was later released in America on January 4, 2002.  Rotten Tomatoes  showed a 78% approval rating among critics with a movie consensus stating ""The well-acted  A Beautiful Mind  is both a moving love story and a revealing look at mental illness."" [ 11 ]   Roger Ebert  gave the film four stars (his highest rating) in his Chicago Sun-Times review and, along with co-host  Richard Roeper  on the television show  Ebert & Roeper , gave the film a ""thumbs up"" rating. Roeper also stated ""this is one of the very best films of the year"". [ 12 ]  Mike Clark of USA Today gave three and a half out of four stars and also praised Crowe's performance and referred to as a welcomed follow up to Howard's previous film  The Grinch ; [ 13 ]  however, Desson Thomson of the  Washington Post  found the film to be ""one of those formulaically rendered Important Subject movies"", [ 11 ]  and Charles Taylor of  Salon Magazine  gave the film a scathing review, calling Crowe's performance ""the biggest load of hooey to stink up the screen this year"". [ 14 ]  The mathematics in the film were well-praised by the mathematics community, including the real John Nash. [ 8 ]   During the five-day weekend of the limited release,  A Beautiful Mind  opened at the twelfth spot at the  box office , [ 15 ]  peaking at the number two spot following the wide release. [ 16 ]  The film went to gross $170 million in North America and $313 million worldwide. [ 17 ]   Also in 2002, the film was awarded four  Academy Awards  for  Adapted Screenplay  ( Akiva Goldsman ),  Best Picture  ( Brian Grazer  and  Ron Howard ),  Directing  ( Ron Howard ), and  Supporting Actress  ( Jennifer Connelly ). It also received four other nominations for  Best Actor in a Leading Role  ( Russell Crowe ),  Film Editing  (Mike Hill and Daniel P. Hanley),  Best Makeup  (Greg Cannom and Colleen Callaghan), and  Original Music Score  ( James Horner ). [ 18 ]  The 2002  BAFTAs  awarded the film Best Actor and Best Actress to Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly, respectively. It also nominated the film for Best Film, Best Screenplay, and the David Lean Award for Direction. [ 19 ]  At the 2002  AFI Awards , Jennifer Connelly won for Best Featured Female Actor. [ 20 ]  The film was also nominated for Movie of the Year, Actor of the Year (Russell Crowe), and Screenwriter of the Year. [ 21 ]     [ edit ]   Accuracy   The narrative of the film differs considerably from the actual events of Nash's life. The film has been criticized for this, but the filmmakers had consistently said that the film was not meant to be a literal representation. [ 22 ]  One difficulty was in portraying stress and mental illness within one person's mind. [ 23 ]  Sylvia Nasar stated that the filmmakers ""invented a narrative that, while far from a literal telling, is true to the spirit of Nash's story"". [ 24 ]  The film made his hallucinations visual and auditory when, in fact, they were exclusively auditory. It is true that his handlers, both from faculty and administration, had to introduce him to assistants and strangers. [ 25 ] [ 5 ]  The  PBS  documentary  A Brilliant Madness  attempts to portray his life more accurately. [ 26 ]   The differences were substantial. Few if any of the characters in the film, besides John and Alicia Nash, corresponded directly to actual people. [ 27 ]  The discussion of the  Nash equilibrium  was criticized as over-simplified. In the film, schizophrenic hallucinations appeared while he was in graduate school, when in fact they did not show up until some years later. No mention is made of Nash's supposed homosexual experiences at  RAND , [ 24 ] [ 28 ]  which Nash and his wife both denied. [ 29 ]  Nash also fathered a son, John David Stier (born 19 June 1953), by Eleanor Agnes Stier (19212005), a nurse whom he abandoned when informed of her pregnancy. [ 30 ]   The movie also did not include Alicia's divorce of John in 1963. It was not until Nash won the Nobel Memorial Prize that they renewed their relationship, although she allowed him to live with her as a boarder beginning in 1970. They remarried in 2001. [ 31 ]    Nash is shown to join Wheeler Laboratory at MIT, but there is no such lab. He was appointed as C.L.E. Moore Instructor at MIT. [ 32 ]  The pen ceremony tradition at Princeton shown in the film is completely fictitious. [ 33 ] [ 5 ]  The film has Nash saying around the time of his Nobel prize in 1994: ""I take the newer medications"", when in fact Nash did not take any medication from 1970 onwards, something Nash's biography highlights. Howard later stated that they added the line of dialogue because it was felt as though the film was encouraging the notion that all schizophrenics can overcome their illness without medication. [ 5 ]  Nash also never gave an acceptance speech for his Nobel prize. [ 33 ]  Around the time of the Oscar nominations, Nash was accused of being  anti-semitic . Nash denied this and it was speculated that the accusation was designed to affect the votes inside the Academy Awards. [ 29 ]     [ edit ]   DVD release   A Beautiful Mind  was released on DVD in the United States on June 25, 2002 as a two-disc set. [ 34 ]  The first disc featured two separate audio commentaries from director Ron Howard and Akiva Goldsman, deleted scenes with optional commentary from the director, and production notes. The second disc included documentaries such as ""Inside A Beautiful Mind"" a making-of documentary, ""A Beautiful Partnership: Ron Howard and Brian Grazer"" detailing the partnership between the director and the producer, ""Development of the Screenplay"" discussing Akiva Goldsman scripting of the film, ""The Process of Age Progression"" detailing the makeup effects, ""Casting Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly"", ""Creation of the Special Effects"", ""Scoring the Film"", as well as ""Meeting John Nash"" displaying the real John Nash. Footage of the real John Nash accepting the Nobel Prize for Economics is also included along with reactions from the winners of the Academy Awards, storyboard comparisons, the theatrical trailer and an advertisement for the soundtrack to the film.

That sounds like happy days to Judge Paul Pritchard.                               Editor's Note   Our reviews of   Apollo 13  (published April 21st, 1999),  Apollo 13: 10th Anniversary Edition  (published April 25th, 2005),  Backdraft: Two-Disc Special Edition  (published October 10th, 2006),  A Beautiful Mind  (published June 17th, 2002), and  Cinderella Man  (published December 13th, 2005) are also available.     The Charge    ""One of the great things about being a director as a life choice is that it can never be mastered. Every story is its own kind of expedition, with its own set of challenges.""—Ron Howard.        Opening Statement    Ron Howard's fine and varied filmography as a director has matured from early movies like 1977's  Grand Theft Auto  to more recent successes like  Willow ,  Edtv , and  A Beautiful Mind . Showcasing acting talents including Tom Hanks, Russell Crowe, Ed Harris, Jennifer Connelly, Renee Zellwegger, Robert De Niro and Paul Giamatti,  The Ron Howard Spotlight Collection  celebrates one of modern cinema's finest storytellers.        Facts of the Case    The Ron Howard Spotlight Collection  features four of Ron Howard's finest:    •  A Beautiful Mind  is a biopic of John Forbes Nash (Russell Crowe,  Gladiator ), a math genius who struggled with both his attempts to come up with an original idea and mental health problems. Beginning at Princeton University, Nash's journey sees him go from teacher to code breaker for the U.S. government to, eventually, winner of the Nobel Prize.    •  Apollo 13  tells the true story of the ill-fated third lunar-landing mission. Astronauts Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks,  Big ), Fred Haise (Bill Paxton,  Aliens ), and Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon,  The Woodsman ) are unexpectedly bumped up the pecking order and given their chance to walk on the moon. Unfortunately, with Neil Armstrong having already set foot on the moon in 1969, this 1970 mission held little public interest, being merely, ""routine."" Thanks to an explosion in one of the spacecraft's fuel tanks, the entire mission is put in jeopardy. Soon the attention of the entire world is focused on these three men trapped between the Earth and the moon. With no chance of landing on the moon, efforts turn to getting the crew home.    •  Cinderella Man  is the retelling of the life of James J. Braddock (Russell Crowe) who, in 1930s America, rose from virtual obscurity to become heavyweight champion of the world. Set against the turbulence of the Great Depression, Braddock became an inspirational figure to many, bringing hope to those suffering the most.    •  Backdraft , the only film in this set not based on real events, is the story of brothers Brian McCafferty (William Baldwin,  Sliver ) and Steven McCafferty (Kurt Russell,  Big Trouble in Little China ). Following in their father's footsteps, both brothers have pursued careers as firemen. Steven, a few years Brian's senior, has embraced the job fully, happily taking risks to get the job done. Brian, having witnessed the death of his father as a child, is more apprehensive and frequently clashes with his brother. When Brian quits the force following his inaction at a fire, he scores a job as a fire investigator and soon finds himself on the trail of an arsonist who seems to be after very specific targets.        The Evidence    A Beautiful Mind  is a film that carries plenty of baggage. From its leading man, Russell Crowe, allegedly losing out on the best actor Oscar due to a drunken fracas in a hotel to accusations of the filmmakers dressing up the story and making significant changes to the book on which it is based, there is plenty to distract from the film itself. Throw in accusations of John Nash, on whom the film is based, being an anti-Semite, something strongly denied and attributed to pre-Oscar mudslinging, and the fact that the Academy gave it the Oscar for best film, over  The Lord of the Rings  no less, and the film suddenly has a lot to prove.    A measured performance by Crowe, fully deserving of his Oscar nomination, is the highlight of  A Beautiful Mind . Crowe, never overplaying the tics and mannerisms, is enveloped by the role of Nash. Maintaining a slight vulnerability, Nash becomes one of Crowe's most accomplished roles. Unlike Crowe, Jennifer Connelly rightly walked off with the Oscar for best supporting actress, providing her finest performance to date in the process.    These performances are crucial as they mask the frequently stumbling screenplay, which suffers from instances of spectacularly unnatural dialogue. Exhibit A: ""Perhaps it is good to have a beautiful mind, but an even greater gift is to discover a beautiful heart."" Seriously, who talks like this? I appreciate films are allowed to exist in a heightened state of reality, but lines like that belong in cheap romance novels, not Oscar-winning movies. Thankfully Nash's story itself possesses enough genuine emotion to overcome such drivel and, in the final moments where an elderly Nash is acknowledged by his peers, Howard is able to bring a tear to the eye with barely a single word being uttered.    Apollo 13  saw Howard tackle the true story of the ill-fated 1970 mission to the moon and craft a riveting film that captures the intensity of the events as if they were unfolding in real time. Splitting screen time carefully between the three astronauts stranded in space, their families, and the efforts of those back at NASA's mission control, this ensemble piece is epic storytelling at its most grand.    Tom Hanks, along with Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon, usually walk off with all the credit when discussing  Apollo 13 . Every accolade bestowed upon the trio is fully deserved. But there is another trio just as deserving of praise that often goes overlooked, despite being the film's engine room. Ed Harris ( The Truman Show ), Gary Sinise ( CSI: NY ), and Kathleen Quinlan ( Event Horizon ) are all just as worthy of star billing as Hanks and Co. but seem content to quietly turn in performances that serve the story, rather than their own egos; highly commendable indeed.    Howard's Capra-esque tendencies are most evident in  Cinderella Man . If this isn't the most beautiful film to come out of Hollywood this decade, it's certainly the most unappreciated.    I know the popular consensus has it that  Raging Bull  is the finest boxing movie ever made, but I'd like to respectively disagree.  Cinderella Man  bests Scorsese's classic by having a central protagonist that the audience can identify with and, crucially, quickly comes to care for. La Motta is a deeply, deeply flawed character and Scorsese and De Niro have rightly been lauded for their portrayal of the man, but Braddock is an inspirational figure. Though I, like many of you, enjoy films that delve into the darker side of life, and explore tortured souls like La Motta, the tale of Braddock, who keeps true to his values in the face of real adversity, warms the heart and elevates  Cinderella Man  to true greatness.    Cinderella Man  opens with Braddock already washed up, this one-time contender facing the end of his boxing career. Coinciding with the Great Depression, his fall into hardship sees the luxuries his boxing career has afforded him disappear and threatens to tear his family apart. Detailing Braddock's rise from the ashes and the hope he brought to so many,  Cinderella Man  is the type of good old-fashioned filmmaking that seems beyond so many working in the industry today; how it failed to become a box-office smash is still a mystery to me. During its theatrical run, a number of cinema chains offered a money back guarantee to anyone who didn't enjoy the film, so confident were they of the product they had.    With Russell Crowe, Paul Giamatti, and Renee Zellweger all in top form, this tale of redemption is blessed with a cast that ensures the film never slips and becomes overly sentimental. The small, but important part of Mike Wilson affords the brilliant Paddy Considine ( Dead Man's Shoes ) one of his finest roles yet.    Howard himself is at the peak of his powers on  Cinderella Man . Fight scenes are intense, tension-filled events. Howard captures all the elements that make the sweet science so captivating and encapsulates them in a series of brutal encounters. With the camera getting up close and personal with the pugilists, Howard ensures the roar of the crowd and screams of the trainers fill the periphery and perfectly recreate these legendary bouts.    Despite the excitement of the ringside action, it's the small things that make  Cinderella Man  so engrossing and ensure it gets under the skin. The scene where a penniless Braddock returns home to find his wife has sent their children to live with her sister, having only recently assured his son this very same thing would not happen, is heartbreaking. Similarly, when a desperate and frustrated Mae Braddock goes to the luxurious home of Jim's manager, Joe Gould, only to find the home nothing but a shell, devoid of the finery that once adorned it, the reality of this desperate time is truly brought home.    Akiva Goldsman crops up again with a screenwriting credit, having also worked on  A Beautiful Mind , and although there are some slips into over sentimentality (""You're everybody's hope, and the kids' hero, and you are the champion of my heart, James J. Braddock.""), Goldsman does enough here to (almost) be forgiven for his part in destroying the Batman franchise.    Not that it's a bad film, far from it in fact, but  Backdraft  feels a little out of place in this collection. A perfectly entertaining film it may be, but, compared to the company it keeps, it feels a little lightweight with a poorly conceived arsonist subplot that feels forced and unnecessary. Less character focused than the other films,  Backdraft  is a fine summer blockbuster but not much more, despite fine performances from Kurt Russell, William Baldwin, Robert De Niro (Casino), and J.T. Walsh ( Breakdown ).    That said, it's impossible not to enjoy  Backdraft  for what it is, i.e., a rollicking good action-thriller. The film features some breathtaking firefighting sequences that take the viewer into the heart of the action. The relationship between Baldwin and Russell leads to some genuinely tender moments that hint at a much better film, had it not resorted to standard action movie conventions and included the aforementioned arsonist storyline. Perhaps it's the fact that  Backdraft  is the only film in this collection that isn't based on a true story that results in it being a less engaging and more throwaway movie. As an example of Howard's diversity, however,  Backdraft  is a worthy addition, though personally I'd have opted for the inclusion of  Parenthood  instead.    One thing evident throughout this box set, is that Howard's directorial style is less obvious than, say, a Scorsese or a Fincher. Rather, Howard adapts his game on a film-by-film basis. Even then, it's arguable that Howard lacks any identifying traits. This needn't be seen as a negative, however. Instead of flashy showmanship getting in the way, Howard crafts well-structured, engaging tales that, with the possible exception of  Backdraft , resonate deeply with their audiences. Consider this: unless you are going into  Cinderella Man  completely blind, you'll know that James Braddock will become the champ, and yet, unless you have a heart of stone, you'll be swept up by the struggles this man went through to keep his family together. The title fight against Max Baer is as tense and exhilarating as any I've seen, despite knowing its outcome. It's to Howard's credit that such audience involvement is possible.    That Howard's back catalogue has one or two misfires in it ( How the Grinch Stole Christmas ,  The Da Vinci Code ) is of little relevance when he has successfully jumped from genre to genre and more often than not been successful. As proven by  A Beautiful Mind ,  Apollo 13 , and  Cinderella Man , Howard is at his best when dealing with real life stories, becoming the closest we have to a modern-day Frank Capra in the process. Though stories of astronauts in peril, a man suffering from mental illness, or a man battling both metaphorically and physically to save his family are rich with emotion, Howard never allows his films to cross over into schmaltz. Like Capra, Howard also makes films that it's okay for a man to cry at…not that I'd admit to such a thing myself.    Each film presented here is blessed with a rock-solid transfer, each as sharp as a tack. Though each film, with the exception of  A Beautiful Mind , has been bettered by a Blu-Ray or HD DVD release, the high quality audio/visual presentation on each title, coupled with the extras for each film, makes this box set the best way to currently pick up these movies.    Talking of extras,  The Ron Howard Spotlight Collection  features a virtual smorgasbord of special features. The box set collects the two-disc special edition of each film, in the case of  Apollo 13  this means the 10th Anniversary edition, replete with the shorter IMAX cut of the film. Pretty much any special feature you could ask for is included here, from commentaries, making of featurettes, deleted scenes, and special effects breakdowns; you name it and it's probably here. This isn't a set that blinds you with the sheer enormity of the extras included either, the breadth of information contained within this box set should leave all but the most demanding viewer satisfied.        The Rebuttal Witnesses    One criticism that this set may struggle to shake, which may put off potential buyers, is the feeling that these films are Oscar fodder. On paper  A Beautiful Mind  in particular feels a little too knowing, a little too worthy. This same suggestion seems to have hindered  Cinderella Man  on its theatrical release.

For the first time in the three-year history of the Festival, Tribeca and ESPN have created a unique competition to find the official Tribeca/ESPN Sports Film Festival trailer that will be scheduled to play prior to all of the films in this year’s sports film festival. The 2009 Tribeca/ESPN Sports Film Festival will take place during the Tribeca Film Festival, April 22 through May 3, 2009.     To participate in the competition, contestants will need to shoot a reenactment of a scene from a classic sports film. Three scenes from two classic Walt Disney Pictures,  Remember The Titans  and  Cool Runnings,  have been preselected for contestants to recreate. All recreations of the scenes should keep within the spirit of the original film and be under 30 seconds.  A panel of Tribeca and ESPN notables will select the top submissions and choose the final winner.  The competition begins Monday, January 5, 2009 and ends Saturday, March 7, 2009.       “Sports and movies have always had a love affair and the Tribeca/ESPN Sports Film Festival brings together fans of both,” said Nancy Schafer, Co-Executive Director of the Tribeca Film Festival.  “We believe this competition will be a creative opportunity for people to get involved with this Festival and we look forward to viewing the submissions.”     Keith Clinkscales, ESPN senior vice president, content development and enterprises said, “We believe great sports stories are just waiting to be told, or in this case, re-told. This competition captures the spirit of our collaboration with Tribeca by encouraging a multitude of voices and perspectives from both veteran and emerging filmmakers.”     Contestants should log on  http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=tribeca/trailer/contest   to download the script pages to both films and then submit their videos. These selected shorts will be featured on  www.espn.com , beginning in early April 2009.            In addition to having the scene play as the official trailer for the 2009 Tribeca/ESPN Sports Film Festival, the grand prize winner will receive a trip for two to New York City (including airfare and hotel accommodations) for two nights to attend the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival, dinner for two at the ESPN Zone, one Apple TV with an I-Tunes gift certificate in the amount of $100, and a 17-inch Apple Mac Book Pro fully loaded with Leopard OS and Final Cut studio.

He convinces the town that it needs a marching band, taking orders for the necessary instruments and uniforms. He also sells music lessons in advance, concealing the fact that he cannot read or play a note of music. In the process Professor Hill galvanizes the town out of its torpor and falls in love with the local librarian/music teacher.   The movie is the original setting for ""Seventy-Six Trombones"" and ""Till There Was You."" The dance numbers are vibrant.

Official Site :  The Da Vinci Code                                                 An inexhaustible fictional source,  The Da Vinci Code  abundantly feeds the most extravagant hypotheses and here comes the last misadventure to date, Ron Howard's film adaptation of Dan Brown's bestseller, which sets the tone from the start as a dismaying narrative and directorial underachievement    Deprived of stakes,  The Da Vinci Code  posters a linearity which, under the cover of legitimacy for a simple spectator, is transformed into a smoky endeavor which falls flat. For an auteuristic purpose, the adaptation imagines a traumatic part placed in each character. All of the characters are bound by a primitive scene. A thin contribution in comparison with the original book, a mystico-religious mumbo jumbo that managed to take the breath away of readers who got excited with its enigmas. Paradoxically, Ron Howard tries to give away the secret while chasing it. His artificial mise en scene, strictly illustrative, arranges nothing. Visually ugly, this talkative film multiplies the explanatory flashbacks. The indigestible whole is supported by pompous omnipresent music, which aims at underlining a tragically nonexistent dramaturgy.    The Da Vinci Code  opens with the murder of the Louvre's conservator (Jean-Pierre Marielle), who we then discover belonged to a secret society. Langdon, a specialist in the study of the symbols (Tom Hanks) is called to the rescue and becomes the target of the police force as well as the Opus Dei, a fundamentalist organization, which protects a secret capable of destroying the Catholic dogma. From Paris to London & Scotland, Langdon, accompanied by Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou), a smart cryptologist, will decipher the code. The truth will be revealed in an unintentionally funny climax (the emphatic acting might also have something to do with this): the young woman is the descendant of Christ and the tomb of Mary Magdalene, her famous relative, is located under the pyramid of the Louvre. The story somewhat returns to its exact starting point, this deceptive narrative device invalidating the opulence of the sets deployed to support these anti-spectacular adventures.   There is no bravura moment here to waken the spectators from the torpor in which they inexorably sink into. Ron Howard does not manage to energize the characters and the story, which cruelly lacks opacity. The actors seem agitated, sometime showing off. And one observes a semi-amused Audrey Tautou, curiously formatted for this film, which looks very French, in terms of aesthetics.   But did we really expect anything else from a marketing product aiming at promoting the Eurostar train?             Sandrine Marques      Translated into English by  Anji Milanovic               A Beautiful Mind           How The Grinch Stole Christmas                                                                                                                <MAP NAME=""boxmap-p14""><AREA SHAPE=""RECT"" COORDS=""37, 588, 126, 600"" HREF=""http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm/privacy-policy.html?o=1"" target=main><AREA COORDS=""0,0,10000,10000"" HREF=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect-home/laplumenoiretheu"" target=main></MAP><img src=""http://rcm-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/rcm/160x600.gif"" width=""160"" height=""600"" border=""0"" usemap=""#boxmap-p14"" alt=""Shop at Amazon.com"">            MAILING LIST  Get our reviews by e-mail  Free & No Spam                     <![if lt IE 4]> <SCRIPT SRC=""http://imgserv.adbutler.com/adserve/;ID=140214;size=120x90;setID=61718;type=js"" LANGUAGE=""JAVASCRIPT""> </SCRIPT> <NOSCRIPT> <a href=""http://imgserv.adbutler.com/go2/;ID=140214;size=120x90;setID=61718""> <img src=""http://imgserv.adbutler.com/adserve.ibs/;ID=140214;size=120x90;setID=61718;type=img"" border=""0""  height=""90"" width=""120""></a> </NOSCRIPT><![endif]>            Add  Plume Noire  as a Friend on Myspace            <![if lt IE 4]> <SCRIPT SRC=""http://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=140214;size=120x60;setID=69336;type=js"" LANGUAGE=""JAVASCRIPT""> </SCRIPT> <NOSCRIPT> <a href=""http://servedbyadbutler.com/go2/;ID=140214;size=120x60;setID=69336""> <img src=""http://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve.ibs/;ID=140214;size=120x60;setID=69336;type=img"" border=""0""  height=""60"" width=""120""></a> </NOSCRIPT><![endif]>                                  |  About  Plume Noire  |  Contacts   |  Advertising   |  Submit for  review  |  Help  Wanted!  |  Traffic   |  Privacy  Policy  |  Questions/Comments  | Store  |  Work in Hollywood  |  Plume Noire en français [in French]  |     Copyright © 1998 - 2008 Plume Noire.

Country   United States       Language   English       Budget   $60,000,000       Gross revenue   $313,542,341       IMDb      Allmovie       A Beautiful Mind  is a  2001   American  film based on the life of  John Forbes Nash , a  Nobel Laureate in Economics . [ 2 ]  The film was directed by  Ron Howard  and written by  Akiva Goldsman . It was inspired by a bestselling,  Pulitzer Prize -nominated 1998  book of the same name  by  Sylvia Nasar . The film stars  Russell Crowe , along with  Jennifer Connelly ,  Ed Harris  and  Paul Bettany .   The story begins in the early years of Nash's life at  Princeton University  as he develops his ""original idea"" that will revolutionize the world of mathematics. Early in the movie, Nash begins developing  paranoid schizophrenia  and endures  delusional  episodes while painfully watching the loss and burden his condition brings on his wife and friends.   The film opened in US cinemas on December 21, 2001. It was well-received by critics, grossed over $300 million worldwide, and went on to win four  Academy Awards , including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actress. It was also nominated for Best Leading Actor, Best Editing, Best Makeup, and Best Score. The film has been criticized for its inaccurate portrayal of some aspects of Nash's life. The film fictionally portrayed his hallucinations as visual and auditory, yet factually they were exclusively auditory. Too, Nasar concluded Nash's refusal to take drugs ""may have been fortunate,"" since their  side effects  ""would have made his gentle re-entry into the world of mathematics a near impossibility""; in the screenplay, however, just before he receives the Nobel Prize, Nash speaks of taking ""newer medications."" [ 3 ]           Contents       1   Plot   2   Cast   3   Production   4   Release   5   Accuracy   6   DVD release   7   See also   8   References     8.1   Additional reading       9   External links               [ edit ]   Plot   John Nash  ( Russell Crowe ) arrives at  Princeton University  as a new graduate student. He is a recipient of the prestigious  Carnegie Prize  for  mathematics ; although he was promised a single room, his roommate Charles ( Paul Bettany ), a literature student, greets him as he moves in and soon becomes his best friend. Nash also meets a group of other promising math and science graduate students, Martin Hansen ( Josh Lucas ), Sol ( Adam Goldberg ), Ainsley, and Bender ( Anthony Rapp ), with whom he strikes up an awkward friendship. Nash admits to Charles that he is better with numbers than people, which comes as no surprise to them after watching his largely unsuccessful attempts at conversation with the women at the local bar.   The headmaster of Princeton informs Nash, who has missed many of his classes, that he cannot begin work until he finishes a thesis paper, prompting him to seek a truly original idea for the paper. A woman at the bar is what ultimately inspires his fruitful work in the concept of  governing dynamics , a theory in  mathematical economics .   After the conclusion of Nash's studies as a student at Princeton, he accepts a prestigious appointment at the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology  (MIT), along with his friends Sol and Bender.   Five years later, while teaching a class on calculus at MIT, he places a particularly interesting problem on the chalkboard that he dares his students to solve. When his student Alicia Larde ( Jennifer Connelly ) comes to his office to discuss the problem, the two fall in love and eventually marry.   On a return visit to Princeton, Nash runs into his former roommate Charles and meets Charles' young niece Marcee ( Vivien Cardone ), whom he adores. Nash is invited to a secret Department of Defense facility in  the Pentagon  to  crack  a complex  encryption  of an enemy telecommunication. Nash is able to decipher the code mentally, to the astonishment of other codebreakers. Here, he encounters the mysterious William Parcher ( Ed Harris ), who belongs to the  United States Department of Defense .   Parcher observes Nash's performance from above, while partially concealed behind a screen. Parcher gives Nash a new assignment to look for patterns in magazines and newspapers, ostensibly to thwart a  Soviet  plot. He must write a report of his findings and place them in a specified mailbox. After being chased by  Russian  agents and an exchange of gunfire, Nash becomes increasingly  paranoid  and begins to behave erratically.   After observing this erratic behavior, Alicia informs a  psychiatric hospital . Later, while delivering a guest lecture at Princeton University, Nash realizes that he is being watched by a hostile group of people; although, he attempts to flee, he is forcibly sedated and sent to a psychiatric facility. Nash's internment seemingly confirms his belief that the Soviets are trying to extract information from him. He views the officials of the  psychiatric facility  as Soviet kidnappers. At one point, he insanely tries to dig out of his arm an implant he received at  The Pentagon , causing much bleeding.   Alicia, desperate to help her husband, visits the mailbox and retrieves the never-opened ""top secret"" documents that Nash had delivered there. When confronted with this evidence, Nash is finally convinced that he has been  hallucinating . The Department of Defense agent William Parcher and Nash's secret assignment to decode Soviet messages was in fact all a  delusion . Even more surprisingly, Nash's friend Charles and his niece Marcee are also only products of Nash's mind.   After a series of  insulin shock therapy  sessions, Nash is released on the condition that he agrees to take  antipsychotic  medication; however, the drugs create  negative side-effects  that affect his sexual and emotional relationship with his wife and, most dramatically, his intellectual capacity. Frustrated, Nash secretly stops taking his medication and hoards his pills, triggering a relapse of his psychosis.   While bathing his infant son, Nash becomes distracted and wanders off. Alicia is hanging laundry in the backyard and observes that the back gate is open. She discovers that Nash has turned an abandoned shed in a nearby grove of trees into an office for his work for Parcher. Upon realizing what has happened, Alicia runs into the house to confront Nash and barely saves their child from drowning in the bathtub. When she confronts him, Nash claims that his friend Charles was watching their son. Alicia runs to the phone to call the psychiatric hospital for emergency assistance. Nash suddenly sees Parcher who urges him to kill his wife, but Nash angrily refuses to do such a thing. After Parcher points a gun at her, Nash lunges for him, accidentally knocking Alicia to the ground. Alicia flees the house in fear with their child, but Nash steps in front of her car to prevent her from leaving. After a moment, Nash realizes that Marcee is an hallucination, because although years have passed since their first encounter, Marcee has remained exactly the same age and is still a little girl. Realizing the implications of this fact, he tells Alicia, ""She never gets old."" Only then does he accept that although all three people seem completely real, they are in fact part of his hallucinations.   Caught between the intellectual paralysis of the  antipsychotic  drugs and his delusions, Nash and Alicia decide to try to live with his  abnormal condition . Nash consciously says goodbye to the three of them forever in his attempts to ignore his hallucinations and not feed ""his demons""; however, he thanks Charles for being his best friend over the years, and says a tearful goodbye to Marcee, stroking her hair and calling her ""baby girl"", telling them both he would not speak to them anymore. They still continue to haunt him, with Charles mocking him for cutting off their friendship, but Nash learns to ignore them.   Nash grows older and approaches his old friend and intellectual rival Martin Hansen, now head of the Princeton mathematics department, who grants him permission to work out of the library and audit classes. Even though Nash still suffers from hallucinations and mentions taking newer medications, he is ultimately able to live with and largely ignore his psychotic episodes. He takes his situation in stride and humorously checks to ensure that any new acquaintances are in fact real people, not hallucinations.   Nash eventually earns the privilege of teaching again. He is honored by his fellow professors for his achievement in mathematics, and goes on to win the  Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics  for his revolutionary work on  game theory . Nash and Alicia are about to leave the auditorium in Stockholm, when Nash sees Charles, Marcee and Parcher standing and watching him with blank expressions on their faces. Alicia asks Nash, ""What's wrong?"" Nash replies, ""Nothing. Nothing at all."" With that, they both leave the auditorium.     [ edit ]   Cast     Russell Crowe  as  John Forbes Nash . A mathematical genius who is obsessed with finding an original idea to ensure his legacy. There was difficulty when casting Crowe, who was well-liked by the producers, when he went to film  Gladiator  in a different time-zone and was difficult to reach for an extended period of time to attach him to the project. [ 4 ]   Jennifer Connelly  as  Alicia Nash . A later student of Nash who catches his interest. Connelly was cast after Ron Howard drew comparisons to her and Alicia Nash, both academically and in facial features. [ 4 ]   Paul Bettany  as  Charles Herman . Nash's cheerful, supportive roommate and best friend throughout graduate college. The character of Charles was not written to be  British ; however, director  Brian Helgeland  provided a tape of Bettany from  A Knight's Tale . The filmmakers agreed that the character could be British, based on Bettany's performance in the film. [ 5 ]   Ed Harris  as  William Parcher . A highly dedicated and forceful government agent for the Department of Defense. He recruits Nash to help fight Soviet spies.   Josh Lucas  as  Martin Hansen . Nash's rival from his graduate school years at Princeton.   Adam Goldberg  as  Sol . A friend of Nash's from Princeton University who is chosen, along with Bender, to work with him at MIT.   Anthony Rapp  as  Bender . A friend of Nash's from Princeton University who is chosen, along with Sol, to work with him at MIT.   Vivien Cardone  as  Marcee . Charles' young niece.   Christopher Plummer  as  Dr. Rosen . Nash's doctor at a psychiatric hospital.   Judd Hirsch  as  Helinger . The head of the Princeton mathematics department.       [ edit ]   Production   Producer  Brian Grazer  first read an excerpt of  Sylvia Nasar 's book  A Beautiful Mind  in  Vanity Fair . Grazer immediately purchased the rights to the film. He eventually brought the project to Ron Howard, who had scheduling conflicts and was forced to pass. Grazer later said that many  A-list  directors were calling with their point of view on the project. He eventually focused on a particular director, who coincidentally was only available at the same time Howard was available. Grazer was forced to make a decision and chose Howard. [ 6 ]   Grazer then met with a number of screenwriters, mostly consisting of ""serious dramatists"", but he chose  Akiva Goldsman  instead, because of his strong passion and desire for the project. Goldsman's creative take on the project was to not allow the viewers to understand that they are viewing an alternate reality until a specific point in the film. This was done to rob the viewers of their feelings in the same way that Nash himself was. Howard agreed to direct the film based only on the first draft. He then requested that Goldsman accentuate the love story aspect. [ 7 ]   Dave Bayer, a Barnard College Professor of Mathematics, was consulted on the mathematical equations that appear in the film. Bayer later stated that he approached his consulting role as an actor when preparing equations, such as when Nash is forced to teach a calculus class, and arbitrarily places a complicated problem on the blackboard. Bayer focused on a character who did not want to teach ordinary details and was more concerned with what was interesting. Bayer received a cameo role in the film as a professor that lays his pen down for Nash in the pen ceremony near the end of the film. [ 8 ]   Greg Cannom  was chosen to create the makeup effects for  A Beautiful Mind , specifically the age progression of the characters. Russell Crowe had previously worked with Cannom on  The Insider . Howard had also worked with Cannom on  Cocoon . Each character's stages of makeup were broken down by the number of years that would pass between levels. Cannom stressed subtlety between the stages, but worked toward the ultimate stage of ""Older Nash"". It was originally decided that the makeup department would merely age Russell Crowe throughout the film.; however, at Crowe's request, the makeup purposefully pulled Crowe's look towards the facial features of the real John Nash. Cannom developed a new silicone-type makeup that could simulate real skin and be used for overlapping applications, shortening the application time from eight hours to four hours. Crowe was also fitted with a number of dentures to give him a slight  overbite  throughout the film. [ 9 ]   Howard and Grazer chose frequent collaborator  James Horner  to score the film because of familiarity and his ability to communicate. Howard said, regarding Horner, ""It's like having a conversation with a writer or an actor or another director."" A running discussion between the director and the composer was the concept of high-level mathematics being less about numbers and solutions, and more akin to a  kaleidoscope , in that the ideas evolve and change. After the first screening of the film, Horner told Howard: ""I see changes occurring like fast-moving weather systems."" He chose it as another theme to connect to Nash's ever-changing character. Horner chose Welsh singer  Charlotte Church  to sing the soprano vocals after deciding that he needed a balance between a child and adult singing voice. He wanted a ""purity, clarity and brightness of an instrument"" but also a  vibrato  to maintain the humanity of the voice. [ 10 ]   The film was shot 90% chronologically. Three separate trips were made to the  Princeton University  campus. During filming, Howard decided that Nash's delusions should always first be introduced audibly and then visually. This not only provides a visual clue, but establishes the delusions from Nash's point of view. The real John Nash's delusions were also only auditory. A technique was also developed to visualize Nash's epiphanies. After speaking to a number of mathematicians who described it as ""the smoke clearing"", ""flashes of light"" and ""everything coming together"", the filmmakers decided upon a flash of light appearing over an object or person to signify Nash's creativity at work. [ 5 ]  Two night shots were done at  Fairleigh Dickinson University 's campus in Florham NJ, in the Vanderbilt Mansion ballroom  [2] .     [ edit ]   Release   A Beautiful Mind  received a limited release on December 21, 2001, receiving positive reviews. It was later released in America on January 4, 2002.  Rotten Tomatoes  showed a 78% approval rating among critics with a movie consensus stating ""The well-acted  A Beautiful Mind  is both a moving love story and a revealing look at mental illness."" [ 11 ]   Roger Ebert  gave the film four stars (his highest rating) in his Chicago Sun-Times review and, along with co-host  Richard Roeper  on the television show  Ebert & Roeper , gave the film a ""thumbs up"" rating. Roeper also stated ""this is one of the very best films of the year"". [ 12 ]  Mike Clark of USA Today gave three and a half out of four stars and also praised Crowe's performance and referred to as a welcomed follow up to Howard's previous film  The Grinch ; [ 13 ]  however, Desson Thomson of the  Washington Post  found the film to be ""one of those formulaically rendered Important Subject movies"", [ 11 ]  and Charles Taylor of  Salon Magazine  gave the film a scathing review, calling Crowe's performance ""the biggest load of hooey to stink up the screen this year"". [ 14 ]  The mathematics in the film were well-praised by the mathematics community, including the real John Nash. [ 8 ]   During the five-day weekend of the limited release,  A Beautiful Mind  opened at the twelfth spot at the  box office , [ 15 ]  peaking at the number two spot following the wide release. [ 16 ]  The film went to gross $170 million in North America and $313 million worldwide. [ 17 ]   Also in 2002, the film was awarded four  Academy Awards  for  Adapted Screenplay  ( Akiva Goldsman ),  Best Picture  ( Brian Grazer  and  Ron Howard ),  Directing  ( Ron Howard ), and  Supporting Actress  ( Jennifer Connelly ). It also received four other nominations for  Best Actor in a Leading Role  ( Russell Crowe ),  Film Editing  (Mike Hill and Daniel P. Hanley),  Best Makeup  (Greg Cannom and Colleen Callaghan), and  Original Music Score  ( James Horner ). [ 18 ]  The 2002  BAFTAs  awarded the film Best Actor and Best Actress to Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly, respectively. It also nominated the film for Best Film, Best Screenplay, and the David Lean Award for Direction. [ 19 ]  At the 2002  AFI Awards , Jennifer Connelly won for Best Featured Female Actor. [ 20 ]  The film was also nominated for Movie of the Year, Actor of the Year (Russell Crowe), and Screenwriter of the Year. [ 21 ]     [ edit ]   Accuracy   The narrative of the film differs considerably from the actual events of Nash's life. The film has been criticized for this, but the filmmakers had consistently said that the film was not meant to be a literal representation. [ 22 ]  One difficulty was in portraying stress and mental illness within one person's mind. [ 23 ]  Sylvia Nasar stated that the filmmakers ""invented a narrative that, while far from a literal telling, is true to the spirit of Nash's story"". [ 24 ]  The film made his hallucinations visual and auditory when, in fact, they were exclusively auditory. It is true that his handlers, both from faculty and administration, had to introduce him to assistants and strangers. [ 25 ] [ 5 ]  The  PBS  documentary  A Brilliant Madness  attempts to portray his life more accurately. [ 26 ]   The differences were substantial. Few if any of the characters in the film, besides John and Alicia Nash, corresponded directly to actual people. [ 27 ]  The discussion of the  Nash equilibrium  was criticized as over-simplified. In the film, schizophrenic hallucinations appeared while he was in graduate school, when in fact they did not show up until some years later. No mention is made of Nash's supposed homosexual experiences at  RAND , [ 24 ] [ 28 ]  which Nash and his wife both denied. [ 29 ]  Nash also fathered a son, John David Stier (born 19 June 1953), by Eleanor Agnes Stier (19212005), a nurse whom he abandoned when informed of her pregnancy. [ 30 ]   The movie also did not include Alicia's divorce of John in 1963. It was not until Nash won the Nobel Memorial Prize that they renewed their relationship, although she allowed him to live with her as a boarder beginning in 1970. They remarried in 2001. [ 31 ]    Nash is shown to join Wheeler Laboratory at MIT, but there is no such lab. He was appointed as C.L.E. Moore Instructor at MIT. [ 32 ]  The pen ceremony tradition at Princeton shown in the film is completely fictitious. [ 33 ] [ 5 ]  The film has Nash saying around the time of his Nobel prize in 1994: ""I take the newer medications"", when in fact Nash did not take any medication from 1970 onwards, something Nash's biography highlights. Howard later stated that they added the line of dialogue because it was felt as though the film was encouraging the notion that all schizophrenics can overcome their illness without medication. [ 5 ]  Nash also never gave an acceptance speech for his Nobel prize. [ 33 ]  Around the time of the Oscar nominations, Nash was accused of being  anti-semitic . Nash denied this and it was speculated that the accusation was designed to affect the votes inside the Academy Awards. [ 29 ]     [ edit ]   DVD release   A Beautiful Mind  was released on DVD in the United States on June 25, 2002 as a two-disc set. [ 34 ]  The first disc featured two separate audio commentaries from director Ron Howard and Akiva Goldsman, deleted scenes with optional commentary from the director, and production notes. The second disc included documentaries such as ""Inside A Beautiful Mind"" a making-of documentary, ""A Beautiful Partnership: Ron Howard and Brian Grazer"" detailing the partnership between the director and the producer, ""Development of the Screenplay"" discussing Akiva Goldsman scripting of the film, ""The Process of Age Progression"" detailing the makeup effects, ""Casting Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly"", ""Creation of the Special Effects"", ""Scoring the Film"", as well as ""Meeting John Nash"" displaying the real John Nash. Footage of the real John Nash accepting the Nobel Prize for Economics is also included along with reactions from the winners of the Academy Awards, storyboard comparisons, the theatrical trailer and an advertisement for the soundtrack to the film.

Howard's films are pure entertainment; they are well-crafted efforts, frequently technically challenging from a production standpoint, and aimed at mainstream audiences. Though some of his lesser works have been criticized for possessing formulaic scripts, Howard's films approach even hackneyed subjects in fresh ways. Though he does not characterize himself as a risk taker, he loves the challenge of exploring different genres; therefore, his filmography includes B-movie actioners, domestic comedies, fantasies, sci-fi, suspense-thrillers, historical dramas, and big-budget action films.   The son of actors Rance and Jean Howard, he made his theatrical debut at age two in a Baltimore production of The Seven Year Itch. He made his screen debut at age five in the suspenseful political drama The Journey (1959). The youngster became a hot property after that and appeared in several features, including The Music Man and The Courtship of Eddie's Father (both 1962). Through this period his father was a strong ally who kept Howard from being exploited by filmmakers. In a November 1996 interview with the Detroit News, Howard describes an incident in which he was six years old and during rehearsal could not cry on cue (Howard doesn't name the production), causing the director to threaten to flog him. Other children may have been terrified, but Howard felt secure because his father was on the set and would protect him. When producer Sheldon Leonard approached Rance Howard about casting Ronny (as he was billed during childhood) as Opie, the son of widowed sheriff Andy Taylor in The Andy Griffith Show (1960-1968), the elder Howard stipulated that his son be allowed time off for a normal childhood. It was as the mischievous but guileless Opie that Ronny Howard became famous. During the popular show's long run, Howard occasionally appeared in other feature films.   While a series' demise often signals the death of a child actor's career, particularly if that child is obviously maturing, Howard managed the transition gracefully and continued working steadily. He was cast in a new television series, The Smith Family, in 1971 and starred opposite Henry Fonda, who became one of Howard's mentors, encouraging Howard to strive for creative growth and to take periodic risks to keep himself vital. The series lasted one season, but again Howard landed on his feet, making a bigger name for himself starring as a callow youth in George Lucas' smash hit American Graffiti (1973). The film spawned Garry Marshall's long-running hit, the '50s revival sitcom Happy Days (1974). Essentially reprising his role from the film, Howard (now billed as Ron Howard) starred as all-American youth Richie Cunningham. Again, Howard also worked simultaneously in films, notably in The Shootist (1976), where he played a teen who worshipped dying gunslinger John Wayne.   Though playing a teenager on the series, Howard was in his early twenties and felt it was time to follow his longtime dream of becoming a director. Producer Roger Corman, who had recently starred Howard in Eat My Dust! (1976), let Howard helm the similarly themed Grand Theft Auto (1977). Howard also co-wrote the screenplay with his father and starred in the film. While not exactly an original masterpiece, the film earned praise for its fast-paced, high-energy action scenes. After leaving Happy Days in 1980, he directed Bette Davis in a television movie, Skyward, and managed to earn the great lady's respect with his filmmaking skills. Howard had his first big hit in 1982 with the black comedy Nightshift. It was to be the first of many instances in which he would work with producer Brian Grazer, who eventually became his partner and the co-founder of Howard's production company, Imagine Films Entertainment (established in 1985), and screenwriters Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel, who formerly wrote for Happy Days.   Howard had even greater success with the Tom Hanks/Darryl Hannah vehicle Splash (1984), which launched Disney's Touchstone Pictures and became the company's most successful live-action film to date. He followed this up with sentimental favorite Cocoon (1985). Earlier that year Howard starred in an immensely popular television reunion movie, Back to Mayberry. He had his first misstep after hitting it big with Willow, a George Lucas-produced fantasy extravaganza that never clicked with audiences, though it has since developed a devoted cult following. During the early '90s, Howard went into a slump when a series of big-budget films such as Backdraft (1991) and Far and Away (1992) did relatively poorly with critics and viewers, but came back strongly with Apollo 13 (1995), a gripping account of a failed moon mission. A masterful blend of special effects wizardry (it contains the most realistic views of weightlessness on film), science, and human interest, Apollo 13 was a huge international hit, nominated for nine Oscars (it won for Best Sound and Best Editing), and earned Howard the coveted Director's Guild Association Outstanding Feature Film Directorial Achievement Award, which puts him in league with such directors as John Ford, Billy Wilder, George Cukor, and Francis Ford Coppola.   In 1996, Howard attempted a new genre with the violent, bloody thriller Ransom, starring Mel Gibson. While an effective suspense thriller in it's own right, Ransom didn't darken Howard's sensibilities in any permanent terms, and after a few stints as producer on both the small screen (Felicity, Sports Night and the silver screen (Inventing the Abbots (1997) and Beyond the Mat (1999)), Howard was back in the director's chair for Ed TV in 1999. Though it was warmly recieved by critics and gained generally positive notice from those who saw it, Ed TV suffered immediate and fatal comparisons to the more popular and strikingly similar Jim Carrey vehicle, The Truman Show. Undaunted, Howard next teamed with the rubber-faced star of Truman for an imaginative and visually dazzling live-action adaptation of Theodore Geisel's animated Christmas classic How the Grinch Stole Christmas. With it's elaborate sets and costumes, as well as Carrey's giddy performance as the grumpy green Grinch, many found the film an overblown expansion of the beloved children's classic (though many were quick to single-out Carrey's energetic portrayal of the Grinch as a entertainingly distracting highlight).  Once again turning back to reality after the marked departure of The Grinch, Howard helmed the sensitive real-life tale of paranoid schizophrenic mathematician turned Nobel Prize winnig genius John Forbes Nash Jr. in A Beautiful Mind (2001). With Russel Crowe essaying the role of Nash and Jennifer Connelly as his faithful and enduring wife, the film gained generally positive reception upon release, and only seemed to cement Howard's reputation as one of the most versatile and gifted director's of his generation as the filmt took the Best Picture award at both the that year's Golden Globes and Oscars. Academy Award night proved to be an even bigger night for Howard as the film also took home awards for Best Actress, Best Adapted Screenplay and, of course, Best Director.   Howard followed up his Oscar wins with the dark Western drama The Missing starring Tommy Lee Jones and Cate Blanchett. Unfortunately, neither critics or audiences were too fond of the over-long film. Lucky for Howard, his next project would see him re-team with A Beautiful Mind's Russell Crowe. The Depression-era boxing film Cinderella Man starred Crowe as real-life boxer Jim Braddock and was released in 2005 to positive reviews and Oscar-buzz.  When not working, Howard spends time at his Connecticut home with his wife, former high school sweetheart Cheryl, and their four children -- three of whom were named after the places in which they were conceived. Neither he nor his wife will permit the kids to become actors until they are fully grown. ~ Sandra Brennan, All Movie Guide                Date of Birth  3/1/54   Occupation  Actor, Director, Producer, Executive Producer, Screenwriter   Worked With    Lauren Bacall ,  Art Carney ,  Richard Dreyfuss ,  View All /a>    Filmography    Ron Howard: 50 Years In Film ,  Tell Them Who You Are ,  Television: The First 50 Years ,  View All /a>                                         Showtimes & Tickets             Enter Zip -OR- City, State       Date of Show                     Choose Date   Today   Tomorrow   The Next Day          Powered By  MovieTickets.com                                   News             Movie File: Ewan McGregor, Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, Gabrielle Union & More       Posted 6/1/05           More Movie News /a>                                                        © 2008 MTV Networks, © and TM MTV Networks.

On the 2nd of December it was announced that a 2009 season will be made which will air on the Seven Network. Each episode involved comedians walking through a door into an unknown situation, greeted by the line ""Thank God you're here"". They then had to improvise their way through the scene. At the end of each episode a winner was announced. It was the most successful new show in Australia of 2006, attracting an average of 1.7 million viewers after the first few episodes.   The show was hosted by  Shane Bourne , who in the past had worked on programs such as the Australian TV variety show  Hey Hey It's Saturday , and is judged by  Tom Gleisner , who in the past has hosted both  The Late Show  and  The Panel . The format was sold for recreation in a number of countries, notably in the United States, where the  U.S. version  began airing on 9 April 2007.

They are greeted by the ensemble cast, in character, with the line ""Thank God you're here!"", and must then attempt to improvise their role in the scene. Typically they will be asked in-character questions by the ensemble cast and challenged to provide information about the scene, including the names of characters or objects. The format is a variation on the established improvisational game ""Occupation Endowments"". In the traditional improv version, one performer enters a scenario she or he knows nothing about and is endowed with an occupation by the other improvisers. The first performer attempts to guess their occupation while playing the scene. [ 1 ]   At least twice during each episode (to cover set-up and costuming for the live audience), footage is shown of each of the four participants performing a challenge, often on location, which was filmed earlier in the week. These include a commentary booth where the contestants have to comment on an unfamiliar subject, an office where they are being interviewed or interrogated (by police, customs officials, etc), showing customers things for sale (cars, boats, pianos, houses, etc), or advertisements (e.g. slimming products, housing developments, etc). The other characters in these scenes are generally played by members of the ensemble cast. The third series also introduced an additional segment in which Gleisner highlights a ""real life""  Thank God You're Here -style situation, such as the infamous  Guy Goma BBC interview  and frequently, that of politicians forced to improvise answers under pressure.   Finally, when all the contestants have played in a scene by themselves, all four enter a final scene together for the ""all-in group challenge"". At the end of the show, the judge declares a winner; this choice is entirely at the judge's discretion, and is largely arbitrary. Honorable and dishonorable mentions are also given, usually to contestants who do not win so that the judge can comment on their performances. The winner receives a trophy in the shape of the program's blue door logo.   There are variations on the standard setup: occasionally the greeting will be slightly changed to better suit the setting (i.e. ""Thank the gods you're here!"" for a scene featuring  Vikings  or ""Thank God you're alive"" in a scene featuring a car  accident ), and often an alternative entrance will be built into the set. These are often used for comic effect, as in the aforementioned car accident scenario where the contestant ( Matthew Newton ) climbed through the back of the set and emerged from the door of a wrecked car embedded in the wall of a second-story flat.     [ edit ]   Ensemble cast   Though their parts are thoroughly scripted, the actors who interact with the guest stars in each scenario are drawn from an ensemble of experienced improvisational actors.   Improvisation experience is preferred so that the cast can react appropriately and immediately to the improvisations of the guest stars, though in most cases this improvisation is limited. This ensemble is also used in many of the assignments, fulfilling the roles of customers or members of the public with whom the guests must interact in a real-life setting.   The following are regular ensemble cast members who have appeared or currently appear on the show (all have been the ensemble cast since the beginning, unless noted).

[ 5 ]  The show was later put on hold to change it to better suit the Czech viewers. [ 6 ]       The Dutch version, ""Gelukkig Je Bent Er"" broadcast its first episode on  RTL 4  in late September 2006, followed by ""Gu' ske lov du kom"" on Danish  TV3  a few days later.       The German version, ""Gott sei Dank... dass Sie da sind!"", [ 7 ]  piloted in July 2006, premiered on 30 November 2006, in primetime on German channel  ProSieben , produced by local Fremantle daughter Grundy LE, but managed only to attract a small audience. It was cancelled after 6 episodes. [ 8 ]       The Russian version of the show, ""Slava Bogu, Ty Prishel"" was first aired on STS channel on 24 September 2006. [ 4 ]       The Swedish version, ""Tack gode Gud"" was first aired on TV4 on 21 March 2007. [ 9 ]  It follows the same format as the Australian version and regularly uses similar scenarios.       The  U.S. version  was picked up by  NBC  after a pilot was shot on 9 November 2006, overseen by  Rob Sitch , who flew to  Los Angeles . It was hosted by American actor and comedian  David Alan Grier  and judged by Canadian actor and comedian  Dave Foley . The program premiered on 9 April 2007 [ 10 ]  with two back-to-back episodes (including the pilot). It followed the Australian format closely, with the additional quirks of the guests swearing they had not seen the sets or costumes at the start of the show, and host Grier appearing in a cameo for one scenario each episode. Though it managed to attract some fairly high-profile guests, including  Tom Green ,  Fran Drescher  and  Wayne Knight  (who appeared twice), NBC announced it had cancelled the show after just seven episodes on 14 May 2007. [ 11 ]       The  UK version  premiered on 12 January 2008 on  ITV . The show was made by  Talkback Thames , a  FremantleMedia  company.  Paul Merton  was both the host and also featured in his own scenes. [ 12 ] [ 13 ]   Hamish Blake  has appeared on the first two episodes of Season 1.
