They are administrated by  Cricket South Africa .   South Africa is a full member of the  International Cricket Council  with  Test  and  One Day International  status. Between 18 February 2007 and 7 April 2007, South Africa was ranked at the top of the ICC One-Day International rankings, and regained the no.1 spot on the 30 January 2009.   As of December 2008, the South African team has played 340 Test matches, winning 35.0%, losing 34.7% and drawing 30.3% of its games.

Here South Africa played its first Test match (against touring  England  at  Port Elizabeth ), becoming the third Test nation.   In 1970, the ICC voted to suspend South Africa from international cricket indefinitely because of its government's policy of  apartheid , an overtly racist policy, which led them to play only against the white nations (England, Australia, New Zealand), and field only white players. This decision excluded players such as  Graeme Pollock ,  Barry Richards  and  Mike Procter  from partaking in international Test Cricket. It would also cause the emigration of future stars like  Allan Lamb  and  Robin Smith , who both played for England, and  Kepler Wessels , who initially played for Australia, before returning to South Africa.   The ICC reinstated South Africa as a Test nation in 1991 after the deconstruction of apartheid, and the team played its first sanctioned match since 1970 (and its first ever One-Day International) against  India  in  Calcutta  on 10 November 1991.   Since South Africa have been reinstated they have achieved mixed success, and hosted the  International Cricket Council   Cricket World Cup  in 2003. However, it is widely believed the sides containing the likes of  Alan Donald ,  Shaun Pollock  and  Hansie Cronje  grossly underachieved, gaining a reputation as  chokers , due to them reaching the semi-finals of the  Cricket World Cup  three times, but failing to progress into the finals, with  Herschelle Gibbs  famously dropping  Australian  captain  Steve Waugh  in 1999 in a league game. They have also had bad press for choking in vital matches in other important tournaments including the  2002 ICC Champions Trophy  and the  2007 ICC World Twenty20 . [ 2 ]   With Donald retiring, Cronje banned for match-fixing and later killed in a plane crash, and Pollock nearing the end of his career, the team has once again changed shape. It is currently captained by  Graeme Smith , although following injuries to Smith and  Jacques Kallis ,  Ashwell Prince  deputised as Test captain on 12 July 2006. At the age of 29, he became the first non-white man to captain the once all-white South African cricket team.   Due to a racial quota policy, the side was once required to contain black players, unlike the past. However, that policy has recently been removed.  [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Tournaments   South Africa has an unfortunate record of failing to win major tournaments. The  1992 cricket World Cup , for example, featured a rain-affected match played before the introduction of the  Duckworth-Lewis method . South Africa was left in the ludicrous situation of requiring 22 runs from one ball in order to progress. At the  1999 Cricket World Cup , South Africa played against Australia in the last Super Six match as well as the knock-out semifinal. Australia defeated the Proteas in the Super Six match and recorded a thrilling tie in the semifinal, which was enough to knock the Africans out of the tournament since Australia had previously beaten them (in the match immediately beforehand). It is in the Super Six match that  Steve Waugh  is reported to have told  Herschelle Gibbs  ""Mate, you just dropped the World Cup"" when the latter dropped him en route to a match-winning century, a comment which has been denied by Waugh himself in interviews. The image of the South Africans following the run-out of their last batsman has become an iconic sporting image, referenced by  The Twelfth Man , among others.   South Africa hosted the  2003 Cricket World Cup , but failed to progress beyond the group stage due to a misunderstanding of how many runs they needed to score in a rain-affected run chase. As a result of this,  Shaun Pollock  resigned as captain and was replaced by young batsman  Graeme Smith , although Pollock continued to play for the team. Under Smith's leadership, South Africa has achieved some success, although they have been hampered by the retirements of many star players, including fast bowler  Allan Donald  and one-day specialist  Jonty Rhodes . As a result, they had a poor 2004, only winning against the West Indies.   South Africa became the world's No. 1 ranked side early in 2007 but then failed to deliver once again in the 2007 Cricket World Cup. They had a rollercoaster ride that included dominant wins over England, the West Indies, Ireland, Netherlands and Scotland, and a narrow win over Sri Lanka, but devastating losses to Australia, New Zealand and Bangladesh that cost them the number one ranking. Then they bowed out in the semifinals with their lowest ever score in a World Cup as Australia bowled them out for 149 and won by 7 wickets. South Africa are regarded by many as the best team never to have won the Cricket World Cup.   However, they won the inaugural  ICC Champions Trophy  in 1998, beating West Indies in the finals, and also won the first and most likely the only  Commonwealth Games  gold in cricket in the same year. They are currently ranked No.1 in the world in the One-Day International Cricket rankings and are rated No.2 for Test cricket rankings. This is due to a long streak from January to November 2005, in which they were not defeated. They gained the top position in the ODI rankings after Australia's defeat in the  Chappell-Hadlee Trophy  series, but lost it during the 2007 World Cup. They regained the No.1 ranking in the One-Day International rankings after a 4-1 away series win over Australia in the 2008/2009 season.   They also hold the record of the Largest Successful Run Chase and the Second Highest Team Total in One-Day Internationals (438-9 in 49.5 overs), in  an iconic match  against  Australia  on 12 March 2006. This game is considered by many to be the greatest One-Day International ever played.     [ edit ]   Tournament history          The South African team at  The Oval  in August 2008.

However, they won the inaugural  ICC Champions Trophy  in 1998, beating West Indies in the finals, and also won the first and most likely the only  Commonwealth Games  gold in cricket in the same year. They are currently ranked No.1 in the world in the One-Day International Cricket rankings and are rated No.2 for Test cricket rankings. This is due to a long streak from January to November 2005, in which they were not defeated. They gained the top position in the ODI rankings after Australia's defeat in the  Chappell-Hadlee Trophy  series, but lost it during the 2007 World Cup. They regained the No.1 ranking in the One-Day International rankings after a 4-1 away series win over Australia in the 2008/2009 season.   They also hold the record of the Largest Successful Run Chase and the Second Highest Team Total in One-Day Internationals (438-9 in 49.5 overs), in  an iconic match  against  Australia  on 12 March 2006. This game is considered by many to be the greatest One-Day International ever played.     [ edit ]   Tournament history          The South African team at  The Oval  in August 2008.

They are administrated by  Cricket South Africa .   South Africa is a full member of the  International Cricket Council  with  Test  and  One Day International  status. Between 18 February 2007 and 7 April 2007, South Africa was ranked at the top of the ICC One-Day International rankings, and regained the no.1 spot on the 30 January 2009.   As of December 2008, the South African team has played 340 Test matches, winning 35.0%, losing 34.7% and drawing 30.3% of its games.

Here South Africa played its first Test match (against touring  England  at  Port Elizabeth ), becoming the third Test nation.   In 1970, the ICC voted to suspend South Africa from international cricket indefinitely because of its government's policy of  apartheid , an overtly racist policy, which led them to play only against the white nations (England, Australia, New Zealand), and field only white players. This decision excluded players such as  Graeme Pollock ,  Barry Richards  and  Mike Procter  from partaking in international Test Cricket. It would also cause the emigration of future stars like  Allan Lamb  and  Robin Smith , who both played for England, and  Kepler Wessels , who initially played for Australia, before returning to South Africa.   The ICC reinstated South Africa as a Test nation in 1991 after the deconstruction of apartheid, and the team played its first sanctioned match since 1970 (and its first ever One-Day International) against  India  in  Calcutta  on 10 November 1991.   Since South Africa have been reinstated they have achieved mixed success, and hosted the  International Cricket Council   Cricket World Cup  in 2003. However, it is widely believed the sides containing the likes of  Alan Donald ,  Shaun Pollock  and  Hansie Cronje  grossly underachieved, gaining a reputation as  chokers , due to them reaching the semi-finals of the  Cricket World Cup  three times, but failing to progress into the finals, with  Herschelle Gibbs  famously dropping  Australian  captain  Steve Waugh  in 1999 in a league game. They have also had bad press for choking in vital matches in other important tournaments including the  2002 ICC Champions Trophy  and the  2007 ICC World Twenty20 . [ 2 ]   With Donald retiring, Cronje banned for match-fixing and later killed in a plane crash, and Pollock nearing the end of his career, the team has once again changed shape. It is currently captained by  Graeme Smith , although following injuries to Smith and  Jacques Kallis ,  Ashwell Prince  deputised as Test captain on 12 July 2006. At the age of 29, he became the first non-white man to captain the once all-white South African cricket team.   Due to a racial quota policy, the side was once required to contain black players, unlike the past. However, that policy has recently been removed.  [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Tournaments   South Africa has an unfortunate record of failing to win major tournaments. The  1992 cricket World Cup , for example, featured a rain-affected match played before the introduction of the  rain rule . South Africa was left in the ludicrous situation of requiring 22 runs from one ball in order to progress. At the  1999 Cricket World Cup , South Africa played against Australia in the last Super Six match as well as the knock-out semifinal. Australia defeated the Proteas in the Super Six match and recorded a thrilling tie in the semifinal, which was enough to knock the Africans out of the tournament since Australia had previously beaten them (in the match immediately beforehand). It is in the Super Six match that  Steve Waugh  is reported to have told  Herschelle Gibbs  ""Mate, you just dropped the World Cup"" when the latter dropped him en route to a match-winning century, a comment which has been denied by Waugh himself in interviews. The image of the South Africans following the run-out of their last batsman has become an iconic sporting image, referenced by  The Twelfth Man , among others.   South Africa hosted the  2003 Cricket World Cup , but failed to progress beyond the group stage due to a misunderstanding of how many runs they needed to score in a rain-affected run chase. As a result of this,  Shaun Pollock  resigned as captain and was replaced by young batsman  Graeme Smith , although Pollock continued to play for the team. Under Smith's leadership, South Africa has achieved some success, although they have been hampered by the retirements of many star players, including fast bowler  Allan Donald  and one-day specialist  Jonty Rhodes . As a result, they had a poor 2004, only winning against the West Indies.   South Africa became the world's No. 1 ranked side early in 2007 but then failed to deliver once again in the 2007 Cricket World Cup. They had a rollercoaster ride that included dominant wins over England, the West Indies, Ireland, Netherlands and Scotland, and a narrow win over Sri Lanka, but devastating losses to Australia, New Zealand and Bangladesh that cost them the number one ranking. Then they bowed out in the semifinals with their lowest ever score in a World Cup as Australia bowled them out for 149 and won by 7 wickets. South Africa are regarded by many as the best team never to have won the Cricket World Cup.   However, they won the inaugural  ICC Champions Trophy  in 1998, beating West Indies in the finals, and also won the first and most likely the only  Commonwealth Games  gold in cricket in the same year. They are currently ranked No.1 in the world in the One-Day International Cricket rankings and are rated No.2 for Test cricket rankings. This is due to a long streak from January to November 2005, in which they were not defeated. They gained the top position in the ODI rankings after Australia's defeat in the  Chappell-Hadlee Trophy  series, but lost it during the 2007 World Cup. They regained the No.1 ranking in the One-Day International rankings after a 4-1 away series win over Australia in the 2008/2009 season.   They also hold the record of the Largest Successful Run Chase and the Second Highest Team Total in One-Day Internationals (438-9 in 49.5 overs), in  an iconic match  against  Australia  on 12 March 2006. This game is considered by many to be the greatest One-Day International ever played.     [ edit ]   Tournament history          The South African team at  The Oval  in August 2008.

This is a  list of the men and women who have been the official South African captains in Tests .   South Africa was a founder member of the  International Cricket Council  in 1909. However, the South African team did not play official Test cricket from 1970 to 1991, having been suspended from membership the ICC as a result of controversy over  apartheid  (most particularly the reaction to the  Basil d'Oliveira  affair). There were a number of  rebel tours  to South Africa in the intervening period, but none of the matches are recognised as official Test matches and they are not include here. South Africa rejoined the ICC, and resumed playing official Test cricket, in 1991.

Rather than keeping Musharraf            in power, the world must demand that Pakistan’s army yield control            over government and economy once and for all.

By Usman Khalid           The Armed Forces and the Judiciary are the two            institutions where performance and conduct of their members are judged            by their peers. After a dumb start, the Chief Justice of Pakistan is            being judged by his peers. But Musharraf has resisted the judgment of            his peers. They have been telling him privately at first and publicly            now that it is time for him to go. That way his legacy, the good name,            and public confidence in the armed forces can be saved           22 March, 2007             Why Musharraf            Stays             By Pervez Hoodbhoy           How does he do it? The answer lies in a finely            honed strategy, perfected over years, that juggles US demands and the            interests of local intelligence chiefs, mullahs, tribal leaders, venal            politicians, and a host of fortune seekers. Webs of intrigue and murky            players obscure details, but the priorities are unmistakeable           20 March, 2007             Protests            Mount Against Musharraf Attempt             To Sack Pakistan’s Chief Justice             By Vilani Peiris & Keith Jones           Islamabad and other Pakistani cities have seen            violent confrontations in recent days between security forces and lawyers,            opposition political activists, and ordinary Pakistanis opposing the            attempt of the country’s US-backed military strongman, General            Pervez Musharraf, to fire the head of the Supreme Court, Chief Justice            Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry           19 March, 2007           Musharraf:            Beginning Of The End             By Brig (R) Usman Khalid           Musharraf is a person who has never needed to make            sense when he talks. So, he talks, and talks but never reflects or listens.            The people are tired of him and desperately want to see the back of            him. But he talks and talks and cannot see the writing on the wall           17 March, 2007           Pakistan's            President At His Dictatorial Worst             By Tarek Fatah           The chief justice had been seen by the military            regime as a direct threat to the implementation of their economic, political            and social agenda. He was removed because he stopped the privatization            of Pakistan Steel Mills and was an obstacle in the American neo-liberal            agenda for the region           14 March, 2007           For            Signs Of Peace,Look Out For Vultures             By Jawed Naqvi           The opening line of the scarcely noticed press            release issued after a second meeting of the India-Pakistan Joint Commission            in New Delhi on February 21 said: The working group on environment has            discussed the decline in vulture population.The news was extremely comforting.            It was deeply reassuring that the two countries that had on several            occasions threatened to annihilate each others human population were            expressing a shared concern for the survival of a raptor bird           27 February, 2007           Terrorism            And The Quest For A Colour Blind Cat             By Jawed Naqvi           The quest for a colour blind cat would be essentially            incomplete if Pakistan doesn't heed its own call to pursue mice of all            hues. In that case, there is this pending issue of terror camps which            even the most neutral observers say do exist in the territory under            Pakistan's control.

However, we fail            to acknowledge the culture of resistance that has developed in neighboring            Pakistan           27 October, 2006           Pakistan Diary: Part IV : Lahore:            Day 1              Mall Road and a Mula Jat             By Yoginder Sikand           The pavement is blocked with milling crowds and            with stalls selling all manner of trinkets and food. It's all so Delhi-like.

By Sujai           India, which has been the champion of independence            and freedom movements elsewhere, has now become the same aggressor it            abhorred. It is slowly becoming exactly like its enemy.

They will protect the source of their power - the army. They            will accommodate those they must - the Americans. They will pander to            the mullahs. They will crush those who threaten their power and privilege,            and ignore the rest. No price is too high for them.

I think I might be            hallucinating and that I might actually be fast asleep and dreaming            in my room in the hostel where I live in Delhi. Tears stream down my            cheeks and I let my emotions overwhelm me. For me, passing through the            archway is like landing on the moon           04 October, 2006           A Trip To Pakistan - Part 1             Heading for the Border             By Yoginder Sikand           Yoginder Sikand works with the Centre for Jawaharlal            Nehru Studies, Jamia Millia Islamia New Delhi.

Millions will go hungry to bed and            remain illiterate since their government thought it better to spend            $60 million a copy on the F-16s           28 March, 2005           Weaponizing            The Subcontinent             By Christopher Brauchli           United States decision to deliver 25 F-16 fighter            jets to Pakistan will only destroy the peace initiatives between India            and Pakistan and once again push the two nations into an arms race from            which USA will benefit economically                         16 March, 2005           Fuelling The            Arms Race             By Praful Bidwai           The rise in India's defence budget has evoked a            hostile response from Pakistan. This could soon translate itself into            acquisition of new weapons to blunt India's superiority and higher military            spending. The likely second- and third-order responses spell a disastrous            South Asian arms race, which will accelerate further as New Delhi and            Islamabad acquire more nuclear weapons and missiles           09 March, 2005           The            Good News From Islamabad             By Radha Kumar           After a depressing lull in the India-Pakistan talks,            during which the two governments appeared to be stuck on niggling technical            details, Foreign Ministers Singh and Kasuri have given us an enormous            breakthrough           02 March, 2005           Country            Visa, City Visa            By Beena Sarwar           Breakthroughs like the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus            service are important. But what's needed to really normalise relations            between India and Pakistan is to make cross-border visits easier for            each other           19 February, 2005           A            Subcontinental Turning Point             By Praful Bidwai           India and Pakistan have agreed to laun a bus service            between the two divided parts of Kashmir from April 7. The bus agreement            raises hopes that able leaderships in both countries could help India-Pakistan            relations soar sustainably to lofty heights            India            Through Pakistani Eyes             By Pervez Hoodbhoy           Observations of a senior pakistani professor on            Indian society           11 November, 2004           With            Love, From India             By Syed Said Mahmood           ""The moment your ""Indian"" identity            is disclosed, you find oodles of people rushing up to you, wishing to            talk to you, offering local assistance and wanting to load you with            gifts"" - Experiences of an Indian in Pakistan           05 November, 2004           The            Great Divide            By Shazman Shariff           The issue of Indian-Pakistani couples facing difficulty            in getting visas or acquiring nationality after getting married tops            the list of problems faced by divided families           01 November, 2004           Propping            Up Musharraf             By Ali Dayan Hasan            Musharraf has successfully convinced the United            States - and other countries - that he is Pakistan's indispensable man.

By the 12 th  century, there were scattered settlements in favored parts of the country. In 1840, the Maori population was estimated at 100,000.    In 1642, the Dutch navigator Abel Tasman sighted Aotearoa. He mapped parts of the West Coast but did not land. IN 1769 the British naval Captain James Cook and his crew became the first Europeans to set food on New Zealand soil. Eventually sealers and whalers began to arrive, followed by Christian missionaries, and the first European settlements were established.    In 1840, New Zealand was established as a colony under the British Crown, when the chiefs of most Maori tribes and representatives of the Crown signed the Treaty of Waitangi on 6 February 1840. This agreement is recognized as the founding document of the nation. The British connection remained an important part of New Zealand culture and Britain was often referred to as ‘home’. Just over 100,000 New Zealanders fought on Britain’s behalf in World War I. New Zealand also made a significant contribution during World War II, with nearly 10% of the population serving overseas. After the war, New Zealand’s agricultural products were in demand and the 1950’s saw prosperity, full employment and considerable growth.     Maori Culture   Maori people have a distinctive culture, much of which is based around the marae – the meeting place of an iwi (tribe) or hapu (subtribe). The word marae refers to the open ground in front of a wharenui (meeting house), although the word is sometimes used to refer simultaneously to the wharenui, the open space and other communal facilities.    The marae is a spiritual place where the dead are mourned, guests are housed, weddings are held, reunions are celebrated, and matters of importance to the community are discussed. Each iwi has a number of marae in its tribal area and in addition there are also urban marae - set up as increasing numbers of Maori people migrate to urban areas. Urban marae typically serve as community centres for people from a number of iwi, and they have modern as well as traditional carvings and decorations. If you visit a marae with a group on a formal occasion, you will receive a ceremonial welcome. The ceremony will differ according to the protocol of the iwi. (see  History of the Maori )     Languages  All New Zealanders speak English and many speak no other language, so it essential that any new migrants speak English well. If may take time to get used to the New Zealand accent, so you may have to ask people to talk more slowly and to repeat what they have said.    New Zealand Maori is the indigenous language of New Zealand and is spoken by about 50,000 Maori people and a small number of Europeans. Interest in promoting Maori language (te reo) has increased dramatically over the last 20 years and is commonly heard on the marae and in rural areas where Maori people predominate. Maori language is also taught in schools and universities.     Becoming a Citizen  New Zealand citizenship gives you the same rights as people born in New Zealand, including the right to have a New Zealand passport. All citizenship procedures and enquiries are handled by the New Zealand Department of Internal Affairs.

The Semantic Web has already begun to transform the ways we maintain, discover and share knowledge across platforms.  The  KiWi - ""Knowledge in a Wiki"" - project  proposes a new approach to knowledge management that combines the wiki philosophy with the intelligence and methods of the Semantic Web.  Pages to get you  started:   KiWi-Vision:  An introduction to KiWi's core ideas, ideal for non-technical audiences.  KiWi-System:  Learn how KiWi aims to break system and information boundaries!  The Use Cases:  Of particular interest for businesses and people from the industry.  KiWi is a blogger!  Read what the project members have been up to. Project Wiki:  Wiki and internal workspace for KiWi project members (NOT identical with KiWi).        The research leading to these results has received funding from the European  Communitys Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement No. 211932.                                                                                                                  Copyright © 2009 KiWi - Knowledge in a Wiki.

The rules are leave your boots on but the river had a fairly sandy bottom, just a few rocks to watch out for and the water was clear and not too deep. Take them off and put them back on again, I decided, so I slung them round my neck. The next obstacle, the bank. Now I not 60, I am 5 and shrinking and I only have little legs, so steep river banks pose somewhat of a problem...

Why are they crying? The play park down the street costs nothing, the swimming pool is open and there are still trees to climb and streams to dam up and the library is free. Why not get a few seeds and dig that overgrown ground up, flowers for mum and a few spuds and fresh vegetables, but that is hard work isn it? Why do the youth of today think it all has to be given to them? Why can they realise that you only get out what you put in?...    Glen Taylor  deplores the selfishness and lack of discipline in modern society.

It is an area of glorious beaches with bush sweeping down to the edge of the sand. It a land of hidden waterfalls, slow flowing rivers and deep dark lakes reflecting the surrounding bush and resounding to the song of birds. It is quiet, it is peaceful, it is a hidden corner where one finds tranquillity...

It just isn like that. The chap in the blue uniform, smiling at you as you hand over your passport, is probably part Maori, but he will greet you with,  hope you will enjoy your stay in New Zealand...

Since time immemorial man had always used waterways for travel, so it was not long before a thriving ferry service got underway up the Taieri and from there one could sail across Lake Waihola to the Tokomairiro Plain. In time, with the advent of the Gold Rush, an inland road would be established to be used by the Cobb and Co coaches, but for now it was by boat and shank pony...

They were shown which plants were edible and which were poisonous, which could be used to cure illnesses and which skin problems, they were taught how to make quick shelters for temporary accommodation and how to prepare and weave flax into clothes and mats and covers.  They learnt where the best fish and eels were to be found, which shell fish to look for and which birds made good eating. Too often the white colonialist tended to think that he was bringing civilisation to the native population when, in fact, the native knew far more about the land than he did and had customs which needed to be respected just as much as his.

clueweb09-enwp00-37-18323	"                     Buy Kiwi Made          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search                Wikinews  has related news:  Greens Party refines 'Buy Kiwi Made' scheme       Buy Kiwi Made  is a Government campaign aimed at promoting consumer and retailer awareness of Kiwi made products and encouraging domestic manufacturers to label their goods New Zealand made. It uses the slogan ""Buy Kiwi and We've Got it Made"". It is complementary to the  Buy New Zealand Made Campaign Ltd  which was formed in 1988 and which licenses use of the kiwi in a triangle logo. New Zealand manufacturers, retailers and the Government have been involved in promoting the 'Buy NZ Made' concept since 1908, and in April 2008 Buy Kiwi Made celebrated 100 years of buying Kiwi made.   After the  2005 elections , negotiations were conducted between the  Green Party  and New Zealand's  Labour Party  that resulted in the formation of the government. The current Buy Kiwi Made programme also came out of those talks and  Rod Donald  was appointed as the Government's spokesperson for the programme.   Within a couple of months of the election and after Rod Donald's death, the Labour government refused a joint Australian-New Zealand initiative to mandate  country of origin labeling  for food, which was seen by some as a rejection of the Buy Kiwi Made programme's objectives.   The Buy Kiwi Made campaign promoting the Buy Kiwi Made and Buy New Zealand Made initiatives included the launch of a new Buy Kiwi Made website. The  Buy Kiwi Made website  was launched on 2 March 2007. The Buy Kiwi Made media campaign will conclude by 30 June 2009. The private sector's Buy NZ Made Campaign will continue to promote use of the kiwi in a triangle logo by its members, as well as promote purchasing of NZ made goods through the shopping portal  getnzmade.net  open to any NZ made manufacturer.

Kiwi  is the nickname used internationally for people from  New Zealand , as well as being a relatively common self-reference. The name derives from the  kiwi , a  flightless bird  which is native to, and the  national symbol  of,  New Zealand . [ 1 ]     [ edit ]   History   The first New Zealanders to be widely known as  Kiwis  were the military. [ 2 ]  The  Regimental Signs  for all New Zealand regiments feature the kiwi, including those which fought in the  Second Boer War  then with the  Australian and New Zealand Army Corps  in  World War I . Much of the interaction between regiments and between regiments and locals was done under the respective Regimental Sign, and the kiwi came to mean first the men of regiments and then all New Zealanders. Due to the relative isolation of New Zealand, many troops stayed in Europe (particularly at Beacon Hill, near  Bulford  on the Salisbury Plain, where they carved a  chalk kiwi  into the hill in 1918) [ 3 ]  for months or years until transport home could be arranged.   The  Oxford English Dictionary  gives the first use of the 'Kiwi' to mean 'New Zealander' in 1918, in the  New Zealand Expeditionary Force  Chronicles. The nickname 'Kiwis' for New Zealand servicemen eventually became common usage in all war theatres. [ citation needed ]   Following  World War II  the term was gradually attributed to all New Zealanders and today, throughout the world they are referred to as Kiwis, as well as often referring to themselves that way.   Spelling of the word  Kiwi , when used to describe the people, is often capitalised, and takes the plural form  Kiwis . The bird's name is spelt with a lower-case  k  and, being a word of  Mori  origin, normally stays as  kiwi  when  pluralised . Thus,  two Kiwis  refers to two people, whereas  two kiwi  refers to two birds.

Kiwi Writers was inspired by Chris Baty's NaNoWriMo and a  great group  of NZ Writers participating in the 2006 event from Wellington.

This station is listed as located in Kaikohe but according to the GM the transmitter is located in Ohaeawai which is east of Kaikohe closer to the Bay of Islands. Newstalk ZB, Nelson NZ 1341  is my first confirmed NZ from the South Island. Heard Oct 16 - Nelson is the fishing capital of NZ.

Critics charge that Section 92 of the Copyright (New Technologies) Amendment Act, enacted this past April, requires ISPs to act on a principle of ""guilt upon accusation,"" cutting off the Internet connections of users merely alleged to be violating copyright.     Section 92 has also drawn the ire of New Zealand's ISPs, under the umbrella of the Telecommunications Carriers' Forum, which has blasted the reform as ""a deeply flawed law that undermines fundamental rights and simply will not work.”  Jamie Baddeley, who heads the country's ISP trade association, argues that the  legislation, which makes providers legally liable for failing to delete infringing material and disconnect infringers, ""has the potential to put some of our smaller innovative members out of business.""       The objections center on two provisions: S92(A) and S92(C). The former, which critics characterize as the ""guilt upon accusation"" provision, is rather vague: It  stipulates  that ISPs ""must adopt and reasonably implement a policy that provides for termination, in appropriate circumstances, of the account with that Internet service provider of a repeat infringer."" While this does not literally require disconnection on the basis of mere accusation, neither does the statute establish any process for those charged with infringement to seek redress. It seems likely that many ISPs, unwilling to risk legal penalties or bear the costs of investigating the validity of copyright claims, will err on the side of disconnection.      Former member of Parliament Judith Tizard, one of the most vocal champions of the bill, dismisses claims that users will be disconnected on the basis of ""unsubstantiated accusations"" as ""fearmongering,"" ""quite simply untrue,"" and ""bullshit."" Yet in  radio interviews , she has appeared to acknowledge that users may be cut off without proof of infringement. ""Yes it is easier for ISPs, Internet Service Providers, to cut off anyone who might be breaking the law,"" Tizard told station 95bFM, ""but you know, you can go to a library and use the Internet, and you can go to another ISP."" Tizard has previously  characterized  Internet access as a ""human right.""     The second contentious provision, S92(C), imposes liability if a service provider ""knows or has reason to believe"" that material stored on its servers violates copyright and "" does not, as soon as possible after becoming aware of the infringing material, delete the material or prevent access to it."" At least one major ISP, TelestraClear, has  already implemented a policy  of pulling sites charged with infringement. ""We don’t check or verify,” head of corporate services Mathew Bolland has explained to local reporters, “We take it down.”     Ars Senior Editor Nate Anderson  wrote about  the Copyright Amendment Act last spring, when he argued that its ""anti-circumvention"" provisions actually compare favorably to those in the American Digital Millenium Copyright Act.

The artist? Or the state? Is the art public domain?    This is the decades-old question being asked by artist  Dina Gottliebova Babbitt , wife of famed Disney animator  Art Babbitt . She saved her own life and her mother’s life essentially by painting portraits of Gypsy prisoners at the behest of  Josef Mengele , during their incarceration in Auschwitz. Years later, she moved to Paris and then to California, where she earned a living working for Warner Bros and Jay Ward.    Today, aged 86 and recently suffering from cancer, she is desperate to get these old paintings back.    Below is her impassioned plea on YouTube to the curators of the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, who, while they acknowledge that she is the artist who created the paintings, still refuse to relinquish them to her, claiming they are the property of the state.     This story was also covered over at  Animation Artist  two years ago, and more recently on  CBC’s The Current  (where I just learned about it this evening). Here are parts one and two of that interview, about 50 minutes long in total, and quite powerful. Below this, some reproductions of these paintings.

There is also a making-of video at that link, but it is in French with  German  Dutch subtitles. Still worth watching, tho!   Happy new year!

JibJab’s latest  year in review  is my favourite yet, due mostly in part to the aesthetic spin they’ve put on their famous collage-style animation.  The illustrative, slightly photocopied-and-cut-out look is gorgeous.

A horrible, horrible (yet hilarious) mirror.

She happily takes commissions, too, if you want to get your own created. I liked them so much, I asked her to create one of  me.  Oh dear, is that what I look like?

Oh no, is it too late for a piece of seasonal holiday animation? I don’t care, because I simply adore  this short  from one of my favourite creative minds,  Trevor Van Meter . And I think you’ll adore it, too.

Says Billy:   I think they rock. The line work is reminiscent of 60s undergrounds. But i must warn all viewers, some are blatantly racist/offensive.

I wonder if love and kindness come in bulk. I sometimes sit around and think about the world and wonder if there is a major reason why goodness is so sparse and wide-spread and why it is so barely prized. If one’s heart were a gem, or a nugget of gold- would it then be of value? If those that gave their all passed and their hearts were pried from their cold, hardened flesh- would there be bullions? Would they be literally weighed down by their faith and beauty?     I guess if this were true, those who were nasty and mean–spirited would be born with lumps of coal amassed in ice. It is a curious thought.

Is Kiwi Writers really free?       Do I have to be a New Zealander to join?       How do I format my posts in the forums?       Why is content half way down the page in My Pages?        Q: Why did you start Kiwi Writers?       Kiwi Writers was started as a place for writers in New Zealand to chat and support each other. We also want to provide a central place where writers can find opportunities available to them in New Zealand.       Q: Is Kiwi Writers really free?       Yes! We are dedicated to keeping it free.       Q: Do I have to be a New Zealander to join?       No. There is a heavy New Zealand focus to the site so we figure you should at least be able to locate New Zealand on a world map.       Q: How do I format my posts in the forums?       The Kiwi Writer's forum uses BBCode. Wikipedia has a great  article on BBCode  or a  simple list  that shows you the basic formatting.       Q: Why is content half way down the page in My Pages?       This is a known bug when using Internet Explorer 6 and occurs on the dynamic pages: Edit Account, Edit Profile and Forums. If you are experiencing this problem and aren't using IE6 please  Contact Us . To fix this error you can upgrade to Internet Explorer 7 or use Mozilla Firefox.

clueweb09-enwp01-06-17698	"                     Kiwi (horse)          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search                    This article  needs additional  citations  for  verification .  Please help  improve this article  by adding  reliable references . Unsourced material may be  challenged  and removed.  (June 2008)       Kiwi  (foaled 1977 in  New Zealand ) was a  race horse  who in 1983 won the most important double featuring races in both Australia and New Zealand, the  Wellington Cup  and the  Melbourne Cup .   Kiwi  raced from 1980 to 1987 and is the only horse ever to win both cups. He was bred by H. B. Fischer and bought by  Waverley  sheep farmer  Snow Lupton  for only  NZ$ 1000, originally to be used as a stock horse on the farm, and was never intended to be tried as a thoroughbred racing galloper.   Legend has it that as Kiwi proved to be a fast and tireless horse on the Lupton paddocks, Lupton was convinced by his friends to enter  Kiwi  in a race at nearby  Wanganui , to see how he ran. Kiwi instantly showed promise, especially over longer distances. He was an unknown quantity at the two mile distance when he was entered in the 1983 Wellington Cup, and won handily. Because no Wellington Cup winner had previously won the Melbourne Cup, and because many believed the quality of the Wellington Cup field had not been particularly strong,  Kiwi  was considered very much an outsider when entered for the Melbourne Cup.   Despite having won over the two mile distance, he was still a distant long shot with the  bookmakers  and punters alike on race day, and started at 10/1. Yet he managed to come from last in the final straight to take the victory and capture the hearts of racing aficionados. After the victory,  Kiwi  was controversially scratched from the 1984 Melbourne Cup, ran fifth in 1985 and looked to repeat his 1983 'come from behind' victory in 1986 but sadly pulled up lame close to the finish line. He ran a creditable fifth in the  Japan Cup . He was retired to the Lupton's farm.

Please help  improve this article  by adding  reliable references . Unsourced material may be  challenged  and removed.  (June 2006)       For other uses, see  Kiwi (disambiguation) .   Kiwi  is the nickname used internationally for people from  New Zealand , as well as being a relatively common self-reference. The name derives from the  kiwi , a  flightless bird  which is native to, and the  national symbol  of,  New Zealand . [ 1 ]     [ edit ]   History   The first New Zealanders to be widely known as  Kiwis  were the military. [ 2 ]  The  Regimental Signs  for all New Zealand regiments feature the kiwi, including those which fought in the  Second Boer War  then with the  Australian and New Zealand Army Corps  in  World War I . Much of the interaction between regiments and between regiments and locals was done under the respective Regimental Sign, and the kiwi came to mean first the men of regiments and then all New Zealanders. Due to the relative isolation of New Zealand, many troops stayed in Europe (particularly at Beacon Hill, near  Bulford  on the Salisbury Plain, where they carved a  chalk kiwi  into the hill in 1918) [ 3 ]  for months or years until transport home could be arranged.   The  Oxford English Dictionary  gives the first use of the 'Kiwi' to mean 'New Zealander' in 1918, in the  New Zealand Expeditionary Force  Chronicles. The nickname 'Kiwis' for New Zealand servicemen eventually became common usage in all war theatres. [ citation needed ]   Following  World War II  the term was gradually attributed to all New Zealanders and today, throughout the world they are referred to as Kiwis, as well as often referring to themselves that way.   Spelling of the word  Kiwi , when used to describe the people, is often capitalised, and takes the plural form  Kiwis . The bird's name is spelt with a lower-case  k  and, being a word of  Mori  origin, normally stays as  kiwi  when  pluralised . Thus,  two Kiwis  refers to two people, whereas  two kiwi  refers to two birds.
