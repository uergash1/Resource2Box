Starbucks is the largest  coffeehouse  company in the world, [ 2 ]  with 16,120 stores in 44 countries. [ 3 ]  Starbucks sells  drip brewed coffee ,  espresso -based hot drinks, other hot and cold drinks, snacks, and items such as mugs and coffee beans. Through the Starbucks Entertainment division and  Hear Music  brand, the company also markets books, music, and film. Many of the company's products are seasonal or specific to the locality of the store. Starbucks-brand ice cream and coffee are also sold at grocery stores.   From Starbucks' founding in Seattle as a local  coffee bean  roaster and retailer, the company has expanded rapidly. In the 1990s, Starbucks was opening a new store every workday, a pace that continued into the 2000s. Domestic growth has since slowed, although the company continues to expand in foreign markets and will open a net of 900 new stores outside of the U.S. in 2009. [ 4 ]  The first location outside of the United States and Canada was established in 1990s, and they now constitute almost one third of Starbucks' stores. [ 5 ]   As of early 2009, Starbucks has more than 16,000 stores in 58 countries worldwide, 11,006 of which are located in the United States, followed by Canada with 976 and Japan with 845 locations. On July 1, 2008, the company announced it was closing 600 under-performing company-owned stores and cutting U.S. expansion plans amid growing economic uncertainty. [ 6 ] [ 7 ]  On July 29, 2008, Starbucks also cut almost 1,000 non-retail jobs as part of its bid to re-energize the brand and boost its profit. Of the new cuts, 550 of the positions are layoffs and the rest are unfilled jobs. [ 8 ]  These closings and layoffs have effectively ended the companys period of growth and expansion that began in the mid-1990s.   On January 28, 2009, Starbucks announced the closure of an additional 300 under-performing stores, and the elimination of 7,000 positions. CEO Howard Schultz also announced that he had received board approval to reduce his salary.

Located in the old Sears, Roebuck and Co. catalog distribution center building.       The original Starbucks was opened in Pike Place Market in Seattle, Washington, in 1971 by three partners: English teacher  Jerry Baldwin , history teacher  Zev Siegel , and writer  Gordon Bowker . The three were inspired by  Alfred Peet , whom they knew personally, to open their first store in  Pike Place Market  to sell high-quality coffee beans and equipment. The original Starbucks location was at 2000 Western Avenue from 19711976. That store then moved to 1912 Pike Place; it is still open. During their first year of operation, they purchased green  coffee beans  from  Peet's , then began buying directly from growers.   Entrepreneur  Howard Schultz  joined the company in 1982, and, after a trip to  Milan, Italy , advised that the company should sell coffee and  espresso  drinks as well as beans. The owners rejected this idea, believing that getting into the beverage business would distract the company from its primary focus. To them,  coffee  was something to be prepared in the home. Certain that there was much money to be made selling drinks to on-the-go Americans, Schultz started the  Il Giornale  coffee bar chain in 1985.   In 1984, the original owners of Starbucks, led by Baldwin, took the opportunity to purchase Peet's (Baldwin still works there today). In 1987, they sold the Starbucks chain to Schultz's Il Giornale, which rebranded the Il Giornale outlets as Starbucks and quickly began to expand. Starbucks opened its first locations outside Seattle at  Waterfront Station  in  Vancouver ,  British Columbia , and  Chicago ,  Illinois , that same year. At the time of its  initial public offering  on the stock market in 1992, Starbucks had grown to 165 outlets.    The first Starbucks location outside of North America opened in  Tokyo  in 1996. Starbucks entered the  U.K.  market in 1998 with the acquisition of the then 60-outlet, UK-based Seattle Coffee Company, re-branding all its stores as Starbucks. By November 2005,  London  had more outlets than  Manhattan , [ 10 ]  a sign of Starbucks becoming an international brand.          A Starbucks coffee shop in  Leeds ,  United Kingdom       In 1999, Starbucks experimented with eateries in the San Francisco Bay area through a restaurant chain called Circadia. [ 11 ]  These restaurants were soon ""outed"" as Starbucks establishments and converted to Starbucks cafes.   In April 2003, Starbucks completed the purchase of  Seattle's Best Coffee  and  Torrefazione Italia  from  AFC Enterprises , bringing the total number of Starbucks-operated locations worldwide to more than 6,400. On September 14, 2006, rival  Diedrich Coffee  announced that it would sell most of its company-owned retail stores to Starbucks. This sale includes the company-owned locations of the Oregon-based  Coffee People  chain. Starbucks has converted the Diedrich Coffee and Coffee People locations to Starbucks as of summer 2007, although the Portland airport Coffee People locations were excluded from the sale. [ 12 ] [ 13 ]   Starbucks' chairman,  Howard Schultz , has talked about making sure growth does not dilute the company's culture  [ 14 ]  and the common goal of the company's leadership to act like a small company.          The first Starbucks branch.       In January 2008, Chairman  Howard Schultz  resumed his roles as President and Chief Executive Officer after an eight year hiatus, and replaced Jim Donald, who took those posts in 2005 but decided to leave the company in late 2007. Schultz's principal challenge is to restore what he calls the ""distinctive Starbucks experience"" in the face of rapid expansion. Analysts believe that Schultz must determine how to contend with higher materials prices and enhanced competition from lower-price fast food chains, including  McDonald's  and  Dunkin' Donuts . On January 31, 2008, Schultz announced that Starbucks would discontinue its warm breakfast sandwich products, originally scheduled to launch nationwide in 2008, in order to refocus the brand on all things coffee. On February 23, Starbucks closed its stores from 5:30 p.m. to 9 p.m. local time to train its baristas. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]   As Starbucks often tests new products as part of its ongoing innovation and transformation, Starbucks started testing selling an 8 oz ""short"" brewed coffee for $1 and giving free refills on all brewed coffee. This test was limited to the greater Seattle market, with no plans for expansion to national markets. Per an internal email this program was cancelled in late March 2008.          A typical sales area, this one in  Peterborough ,  UK , showing a display of food and the beverage preparation area       In March 2008, Schultz made several announcements to Starbucks  shareholders . Shultz introduced Starbucks' ""state of the art espresso system"", [ 17 ]  the  Thermoplan AG  manufactured Mastrena, which replaced their previous superauto, the Thermoplan Verismo 801(known internationally as the Thermoplan Black & White). Starbucks also announced that the company hopes to enter the energy drink market and introduce a customer reward program. Pre-ground beans will also no longer be used, in order that the additional grinding of all whole bean coffee will ""bring aroma, romance and theater"" to American stores. [ 18 ]  The company also announced the recent acquisition of The Coffee Equipment Company, [ 17 ]  the manufacturer of the Clover Brewing System. They are currently test marketing this unique ""fresh-pressed"" coffee system at six Starbucks locations, three in Seattle, and three in Boston. [ 19 ]   In May 2008, a rewards program was initiated for registered users of the Starbucks Card. Previously simply a gift card, the Starbucks Card has undergone a transition into a rewards card, similar to cards offered by other retail outlets. Perks and rewards offered to registered users are 2 hours of free Wi-Fi Internet service per day, free refills of brewed coffee (some locations only honour this for the first 3 hours of your stay), a free tall beverage with the purchase of 1 lb. of whole bean coffee, as well as free milk (e.g. soy) and syrup drink modifiers. [ 20 ]  This is a new and aggressive approach by Starbucks to create and strengthen customer loyalty.   Tags displaying the title ""Master"" are worn by employees who have completed the Coffee Master course, which educates employees in not only the tasting, but also growing regions, roasting, and purchasing (including  fair trade  practices) aspects of the coffee industry. Almost 70% of the coffee used by Starbucks around the world comes from the sixth major producer in the world,  Guatemala , a pro-organic producer.   Starting in November of 2008 Starbucks began selling Product Red goods. According to the website because of this they have been able to provide AIDS medicine for 3,800 for an entire year. [ 21 ]     [ edit ]   Intellectual property   Starbucks U.S. Brands, LLC, is a Starbucks-owned company that currently holds and owns the property rights to approximately 120 Starbucks Coffee Company patents and trademarks. It is located at 2525 Starbucks Way in  Minden, Nevada . [ 22 ]     [ edit ]   Name   The company is named in part after  Starbuck ,  Captain Ahab 's  first mate  in the book  Moby-Dick , as well as a turn-of-the-century mining camp ( Starbo  or  Storbo ) on  Mount Rainier . According to  Howard Schultz 's book  Pour Your Heart Into It: How Starbucks Built a Company One Cup at a Time , the name of the company was derived from  Moby-Dick , although not in as direct a fashion as many assume. Gordon Bowker liked the name ""Pequod"" (the ship in the novel), but his then creative partner Terry Heckler responded, ""No one's going to drink a cup of Pee-quod!"" Heckler suggested ""Starbo"". Brainstorming with these two ideas resulted in the company being named for the  Pequod' s first mate, Starbuck.

[ 25 ]  The logo has been significantly streamlined over the years. In the first version, which gave the impression of an authentic 15th century European  woodcut , the Starbucks siren was topless and had a fully visible double fish tail. The image also had a rough visual texture. In the second version, which was used from 1987-92, her breasts were covered by her flowing hair, but her  navel  was still visible, and the fish tail was cropped slightly. In the current version, used since 1992, her navel and breasts are not visible at all, and only vestiges remain of the fish tails. The original ""woodcut"" logo can still be seen on the Starbucks store in Seattle's Pike Place Market, and on both the House Blend and Decaf House Blend packaging.   At the beginning of September 2006 and then again in early 2008, Starbucks temporarily reintroduced its original brown logo on paper hot drink cups. Starbucks has stated that this was done to show the company's heritage from the Pacific Northwest and to celebrate 35 years of business. The vintage logo sparked some controversy due in part to the siren's bare breasts, [ 26 ]  but the temporary switch garnered little attention from the media. Starbucks had drawn similar criticism when they reintroduced the vintage logo in 2006. [ 27 ]     [ edit ]   Parodies and infringements     [ edit ]   Environmental record          Starbucks inside  Tsutaya  in  Shibuya ,  Japan       In 1999, Starbucks started ""Grounds for your Garden"" to make their business more environment friendly. ""Grounds for your Garden"" is a year round program that gives leftover coffee grounds to anyone requesting it for composting. Although not all stores and regions participate, customers can request and rally their local Starbucks to begin the practice. In 2004, Starbucks began reducing the size of their paper napkins and store garbage bags, and lightening their solid waste production by 1.8 million pounds. [ 28 ] The U.S.  Food and Drug Administration  granted the first-ever approval to use recycled content in  food packaging  for Starbucks coffee cups. In 2005 Starbucks received the National Recycling Coalition Recycling Works Award. [ 29 ]  In 2008, Starbucks was ranked #15 on the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency 's list of Top 25 Green Power Partners for purchases of renewable energy. [ 30 ]   Starbucks has also received criticism from environmentalists. ""Dr. Allen Hershkowitz, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, says that Starbucks claimed they were using only 10 percent recycled material partly because the recycled material costs more."" [ 31 ]  In October 2008, The UK newspaper  The Sun  reported that Starbucks was wasting 23.4 million litres of water a day by leaving a tap constantly running for rinsing utensils in a ' dipper well ' in each of its stores worldwide. [ 32 ]   Does anyone know other environmental impact stats for Starbucks annually-- Asiachai  ( talk ) 17:30, 16 March 2009 (UTC)     [ edit ]   Criticism and controversy          Starbucks at the  Forbidden City  in  Beijing  (closed since July 2007)       Several activist groups maintain websites criticizing the company's  fair-trade  policies, labor relations, and environmental impact, and hold it as a prime example of U.S. cultural and economic  imperialism . Several Starbucks locations were vandalized during the  WTO   meeting held in Seattle in late 1999 .   The Starbucks location in the former imperial palace in Beijing closed in July 2007. The coffee shop had been a source of ongoing controversy since its opening in 2000 with protesters objecting that the presence of the American chain in this location ""was trampling on Chinese culture"". [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ]     [ edit ]   Anti-competitive tactics   Some of the methods Starbucks has used to expand and maintain their dominant market position include buying out competitors' leases, intentionally operating at a loss, and clustering several locations in a small geographical area (i.e., saturating the market), have been labeled anti-competitive by critics. [ 37 ]  For example, Starbucks fueled its initial expansion into the UK market with a buyout of Seattle Coffee Company, but then used its capital and influence to obtain prime locations, some of which operated at a financial loss. Critics claimed this was an unfair attempt to drive out small, independent competitors, who could not afford to pay inflated prices for premium real estate. [ 38 ]     [ edit ]   Labor disputes   Starbucks workers throughout seven different stores have joined the  Industrial Workers of the World  (IWW) as the  Starbucks Workers Union  since 2004. [ 39 ]          Starbucks in the  Financial District  of  Boston, Massachusetts       According to a Starbucks Union press release, since then, the union membership has begun expanding to Chicago and Maryland in addition to  New York City  where the movement originated. [ 40 ]  On March 7, 2006, the IWW and Starbucks agreed to a  National Labor Relations Board  settlement in which three Starbucks workers were granted almost US$2,000 in back wages and two fired employees were offered reinstatement. [ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ]  According to the Starbucks Union, on November 24, 2006, IWW members picketed Starbucks locations in more than 50 cities around the world in countries including Australia, Canada, Germany, and the UK, as well as U.S. cities including New York, Chicago, Minneapolis and San Francisco, [ 44 ]  to protest the firing of five Starbucks Workers Union organizers by Starbucks and to demand their reinstatement.   Some Starbucks baristas in Canada, [ 45 ]  Australia and New Zealand, [ 46 ]  and the United States [ 47 ]  belong to a variety of unions. In 2005, Starbucks paid out US$165,000 to eight employees at its Kent, Washington, roasting plant to settle charges that they had been retaliated against for being pro-union. At the time, the plant workers were represented by the  IUOE . Starbucks admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement. [ 39 ]          A Starbucks located in  Lima ,  Peru       A Starbucks strike occurred in  Auckland ,  New Zealand , on November 23, 2005. [ 46 ]  Organized by  Unite Union , workers sought secure hours, a  minimum wage  of NZ$12 an hour, and the abolition of youth rates. The company settled with the Union in 2006, resulting in pay increases, increased security of hours, and an improvement in youth rates. [ 48 ]   According to Starbucks Chairman Howard Schulz, ""If they had faith in me and my motives, they wouldn't need a union."" [ 49 ]  According to  The Seattle Times , ""The International Union of Operating Engineers Local 286 had trouble with Starbucks at its Kent roasting plant, where the union no longer represents workers"". [ 39 ]   In March 2008, Starbucks was ordered to pay  baristas  over  US$ 100 million in back tips in a  Californian   class action lawsuit  launched by baristas alleging that granting shift-supervisors a portion of  tips  violates state  labor laws . The Company plans to appeal. Similarly, an 18 year-old barista in Chestnut Hill, MA has just filed another suit with regards to the tipping policy. Massachusetts law also states that managers may not get a cut of tips.  [ 50 ] [ 51 ]  A similar lawsuit was also filed in Minnesota on March 27, 2008.  [ 52 ]     [ edit ]   Coffee bean market   In 2000, the company introduced a line of  fair trade  products. [ 53 ]   Of the approximately 136,000 tonnes (300 million pounds) of coffee Starbucks purchased in 2006, about 6 percent was certified as fair trade. [ 54 ]   According to Starbucks, they purchased 2,180 tonnes (4.8 million pounds) of Certified Fair Trade coffee in fiscal year 2004 and 5,220 tonnes (11.5 million pounds) in 2005. They have become the largest buyer of Certified Fair Trade coffee in North America (10% of the global market). Transfair USA, [ 55 ]  the only third-party certifier of Fair Trade Certified coffee in the United States, has noted the impact Starbucks has made in the area of Fair Trade and coffee farmer's lives by saying:       Since launching {its} FTC coffee line in 2000, Starbucks has undeniably made a significant contribution to family farmers through their rapidly growing FTC coffee volume. By offering FTC coffee in thousands of stores, Starbucks has also given the FTC label greater visibility, helping to raise consumer awareness in the process.       Groups such as  Global Exchange  are calling for Starbucks to further increase its sales of fair trade coffees. Fair trade certification can cost US$2,500 to US$10,000, based on the size of the producer group and length of time the inspections take, and many growers are unwilling or unable to pay for certification. [ 56 ]   Beyond Fair Trade Certification, Starbucks argues that it pays above market prices for all of its coffee. According to the company, in 2004 it paid on average $1.42 per pound ($2.64kg) for high-quality coffee beans. [ 57 ]  This is in comparison to commodity prices which were as low as $0.50$0.60 in 20032004. [ 58 ]     [ edit ]   Ethos water controversy          A Starbucks located in  Trujillo ,  Per       Ethos , a brand of bottled water acquired by Starbucks in 2005, is sold at locations throughout North America. Ethos bottles feature prominent labeling stating ""helping children get clean water"", referring to the fact that $.05 from each $1.80 bottle sold ($.10 per unit in Canada) is used to fund clean water projects in under-developed areas. Although sales of Ethos water have raised over $6,200,000 for clean water efforts, the brand is not a charity. Critics have argued that the claim on the label misleads consumers into thinking that Ethos is primarily a charitable organization, when it is actually a for-profit Starbucks brand and the vast majority of the sale price (97.2%) does not support clean-water projects. [ 59 ] [ 60 ]  The founders of Ethos have stated that the brand is intended to raise awareness of third-world clean water issues and provide socially responsible consumers with an opportunity to support the cause by choosing Ethos over other brands. [ 61 ]  Starbucks has since redesigned the American version of the Ethos water bottles, stating the amount of money donated per bottle in the description.     [ edit ]   Brighton store opens in breach of planning regulations   In May 2008, a branch of Starbucks was completed in  Kemptown  on St. James's Street,  Brighton, England , despite having being refused permission by the local planning authority, Brighton and Hove City Council. They claimed there were too many coffee shops already present on the street. [ 62 ] [ 63 ]  Starbucks has appealed the decision, with Brighton and Hove council monitoring the situation. [ 64 ]   Brighton & Hove City Council have served Starbucks with an enforcement notice (which they have appealed) to remove all tables and chairs from the premises in order to comply with planning regulations and operate as an A1 retail shop, rather than an A3 coffee shop/restaurant, for which they have no planning permission. The deadline of the enforcement is 20 February 2009. [ 65 ]     [ edit ]   Alleged relationship with the Israeli military   There have been calls for boycott of Starbucks stores and products because it is alleged that Starbucks sends part of its profits to the  Israeli military . [ 66 ]  It has been long alleged that Schultz is ""an active  Zionist ""  [ 67 ]  and is a recipient of several Israeli awards including ""The Israel 50th Anniversary Tribute Award"" for ""playing a key role in promoting a close alliance between the United States and Israel."" [ 68 ]  In response to these allegations Starbucks issued a statement saying Neither Chairman Howard Schultz nor Starbucks fund or support the Israeli Army. Starbucks is a non-political organization and does not support individual political causes. [ 69 ]  Starbucks has been a regular target of activists protesting against the  Israeli intervention in Gaza . Starbucks was forced to close a store in  Beirut ,  Lebanon  because of demonstrators shouting anti-Israel slogans and causing customers to flee. [ 70 ]  Protesters in Beirut told the  Associated Press  that they targeted Starbucks because they claim Chairman and CEO Howard Schultz donates money to the Israeli military. They hung several banners on the shop's window and used white tape to paste a  Star of David  over the green-and-white Starbucks sign. They also distributed a letter saying Schultz ""is one of the pillars of the American  Jewish lobby  and the owner of the Starbucks,"" which they said donates money to the Israeli military. [ 71 ]  Starbucks responded by saying ""Rumors that Starbucks Coffee Company and its management support Israel are unequivocally false. ... Starbucks is a nonpolitical organization and does not support political causes. Further, political preferences of a Starbucks partner [employee] at any level have absolutely no bearing on Starbucks company policies."" [ 72 ]     [ edit ]   Violence against Starbucks in the United Kingdom   On January 12, 2009, a Starbucks in Whitechapel Road in  London  was the target of vandalism by pro- Palestinian  demonstrators broke windows and reportedly ripped out fittings and equipment after clashes with riot police. Later the same day, after midnight, a suspected makeshift firebomb was hurled into the premises, causing further damage. [ 73 ] [ 74 ] [ 75 ]   On January 17, 2009, at an anti-Israel protest held by the  Stop the War Coalition  in  Trafalgar Square  in central  London , British Rapper  Lowkey  stated, with regard to Starbucks, that: ""You say you know about the Zionist lobby but you put money in their pockets every time youre buying their coffee."" After the rally, two groups of people, many wearing scarves over their faces, smashed and looted two Starbucks on Piccadilly and Shaftesbury Avenue. Although the Starbucks stores had requested greater police protection following the violence against a Starbucks the previous week,  Scotland Yard  stated it could ""not stop thugs hell-bent on causing damage."" [ 76 ] [ 74 ] [ 77 ] [ 78 ]     [ edit ]   Accusations by Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi   In a sermon delivered by Muslim cleric Sheikh  Yusuf al-Qaradawi , which aired on  Al Jazeera TV  on January 9, 2009 (as translated by MEMRI), Al-Qaradhawi accused Starbucks of supporting Israeli education and the Israeli Army and called for a boycott of the company and other western chains. [ 79 ]  Al-Qaradawi has previously called for a similar boycott of all US products with limited success. [ 80 ]  Starbucks has not commented directly on Al-Qaradawi's accusations, but has in the past, denied supporting Israel or any other political action. [ 73 ]     [ edit ]   Other ventures   Main article:  Hear Music   Starbucks entered the music industry in 1999 with the acquisition of Hear Music, and the film industry in 2006 with the creation of Starbucks Entertainment. Starbucks Entertainment was one of the producers of the 2006 film  Akeelah and the Bee . Retail stores heavily advertised the film before its release.   Hear Music is the brand name of Starbucks' retail music concept. Hear Music began as a catalog company in 1990 and was purchased by Starbucks in 1999. Nearly three years later, in 2002, they produced a Starbucks opera album, featuring artists such as  Luciano Pavarotti .     [ edit ]   Partnership with Apple   Starbucks has agreed to a partnership with  Apple  to collaborate on selling music as part of the coffeehouse experience. In October 2006, Apple added a Starbucks Entertainment area to the  iTunes Store , selling similar music that appeared in Starbucks stores. In September 2007 Apple announced that there would be wireless communication between Apple and Starbucks. Through the AT&T Wi-Fi, a paywall is opened up to allow any individual connecting to AT&T wifi access to the  iTunes Store  (regardless of whether he or she is an AT&T subscriber). The partnership is primarily targeted at  iPhone ,  iPod Touch , and  Macbook  users (although anyone with access to iTunes can take advantage of it). In addition, the iTunes Store will automatically detect the current and last 10 songs playing in a Starbucks and offer users connected to the store's wireless network the opportunity to download the tracks. This feature has been rolled out in  Seattle ,  New York City , and the  San Francisco Bay Area , and will slowly be offered in limited markets during 20072008. [ 81 ]  During the fall of 2007, Starbucks also began to sell digital downloads of certain albums through iTunes. The buyer would buy the download at Starbucks, and enter the code on the download card at the iTunes Store, and then the entire album would immediately start downloading. From October 2 to November 7, 2007, Starbucks gave away 37 different songs for free download through iTunes as part of the ""Song of the Day"" promotion. Each day, baristas would give out download cards for a particular song which could be redeemed on iTunes. Currently, every Tuesday, a new ""Pick of the Week"" download card is available at Starbucks for a free song download, similar to its previous ""Song of the Day.""

clueweb09-en0004-45-33079	  I took this picture in the Sea/Tac airport a few years ago (1999? 2000?) while enjoying a grande mocha Frappuccino TM .  It's actually a picture of a person, that happened to include the Starbucks kiosk sign, but in this scan I have cropped it to just the logo.   Notice that although at first glance it looks just like the current Starbucks logo you see everywhere, it's actually different — the whole mermaid is visible.  (Also, her tail fins have three points instead of the modern two.)  In the modern logo, she's cropped to show less of her.  I heard a rumor that they did that to appease people who thought this logo offensive, since it sort-of looks like she's spreading her legs.  Irrespective of that, I think the modern logo looks better than this one.      Update:  Simon Quinn sent me  this picture  of an even more risque Starbucks logo, purportedly in front of the  original  Starbucks in Seattle!  Check it out.    Back to my  homepage .

Starbucks is the largest  coffeehouse  company in the world, [ 2 ]  with 16,120 stores in 44 countries. [ 3 ]  Starbucks sells  drip brewed coffee ,  espresso -based hot drinks, other hot and cold drinks, snacks, and items such as mugs and coffee beans. Through the Starbucks Entertainment division and  Hear Music  brand, the company also markets books, music, and film. Many of the company's products are seasonal or specific to the locality of the store. Starbucks-brand ice cream and coffee are also sold at grocery stores.   From Starbucks' founding in Seattle as a local  coffee bean  roaster and retailer, the company has expanded rapidly. In the 1990s, Starbucks was opening a new store every workday, a pace that continued into the 2000s. Domestic growth has since slowed, although the company continues to expand in foreign markets and will open a net of 900 new stores outside of the U.S. in 2009. [ 4 ]  The first location outside of the United States and Canada was established in 1990s, and they now constitute almost one third of Starbucks' stores. [ 5 ]   As of early 2009, Starbucks has more than 16,000 stores in 58 countries worldwide, 11,006 of which are located in the United States, followed by Canada with 976 and Japan with 845 locations. On July 1, 2008, the company announced it was closing 600 under-performing company-owned stores and cutting U.S. expansion plans amid growing economic uncertainty. [ 6 ] [ 7 ]  On July 29, 2008, Starbucks also cut almost 1,000 non-retail jobs as part of its bid to re-energize the brand and boost its profit. Of the new cuts, 550 of the positions are layoffs and the rest are unfilled jobs. [ 8 ]  These closings and layoffs have effectively ended the companys period of growth and expansion that began in the mid-1990s.   On January 28, 2009, Starbucks announced the closure of an additional 300 under-performing stores, and the elimination of 7,000 positions. CEO Howard Schultz also announced that he had received board approval to reduce his salary.

Located in the old Sears, Roebuck and Co. catalog distribution center building.       The original Starbucks was opened in Pike Place Market in Seattle, Washington, in 1971 by three partners: English teacher  Jerry Baldwin , history teacher  Zev Siegel , and writer  Gordon Bowker . The three were inspired by  Alfred Peet , whom they knew personally, to open their first store in  Pike Place Market  to sell high-quality coffee beans and equipment. The original Starbucks location was at 2000 Western Avenue from 19711976. That store then moved to 1912 Pike Place; it is still open. During their first year of operation, they purchased green  coffee beans  from  Peet's , then began buying directly from growers.   Entrepreneur  Howard Schultz  joined the company in 1982, and, after a trip to  Milan, Italy , advised that the company should sell coffee and  espresso  drinks as well as beans. The owners rejected this idea, believing that getting into the beverage business would distract the company from its primary focus. To them,  coffee  was something to be prepared in the home. Certain that there was much money to be made selling drinks to on-the-go Americans, Schultz started the  Il Giornale  coffee bar chain in 1985.   In 1984, the original owners of Starbucks, led by Baldwin, took the opportunity to purchase Peet's (Baldwin still works there today). In 1987, they sold the Starbucks chain to Schultz's Il Giornale, which rebranded the Il Giornale outlets as Starbucks and quickly began to expand. Starbucks opened its first locations outside Seattle at  Waterfront Station  in  Vancouver ,  British Columbia , and  Chicago ,  Illinois , that same year. At the time of its  initial public offering  on the stock market in 1992, Starbucks had grown to 165 outlets.    The first Starbucks location outside of North America opened in  Tokyo  in 1996. Starbucks entered the  U.K.  market in 1998 with the acquisition of the then 60-outlet, UK-based Seattle Coffee Company, re-branding all its stores as Starbucks. By November 2005,  London  had more outlets than  Manhattan , [ 10 ]  a sign of Starbucks becoming an international brand.          A Starbucks coffee shop in  Leeds ,  United Kingdom       In 1999, Starbucks experimented with eateries in the San Francisco Bay area through a restaurant chain called Circadia. [ 11 ]  These restaurants were soon ""outed"" as Starbucks establishments and converted to Starbucks cafes.   In April 2003, Starbucks completed the purchase of  Seattle's Best Coffee  and  Torrefazione Italia  from  AFC Enterprises , bringing the total number of Starbucks-operated locations worldwide to more than 6,400. On September 14, 2006, rival  Diedrich Coffee  announced that it would sell most of its company-owned retail stores to Starbucks. This sale includes the company-owned locations of the Oregon-based  Coffee People  chain. Starbucks has converted the Diedrich Coffee and Coffee People locations to Starbucks as of summer 2007, although the Portland airport Coffee People locations were excluded from the sale. [ 12 ] [ 13 ]   Starbucks' chairman,  Howard Schultz , has talked about making sure growth does not dilute the company's culture  [ 14 ]  and the common goal of the company's leadership to act like a small company.          The first Starbucks branch.       In January 2008, Chairman  Howard Schultz  resumed his roles as President and Chief Executive Officer after an eight year hiatus, and replaced Jim Donald, who took those posts in 2005 but decided to leave the company in late 2007. Schultz's principal challenge is to restore what he calls the ""distinctive Starbucks experience"" in the face of rapid expansion. Analysts believe that Schultz must determine how to contend with higher materials prices and enhanced competition from lower-price fast food chains, including  McDonald's  and  Dunkin' Donuts . On January 31, 2008, Schultz announced that Starbucks would discontinue its warm breakfast sandwich products, originally scheduled to launch nationwide in 2008, in order to refocus the brand on all things coffee. On February 23, Starbucks closed its stores from 5:30 p.m. to 9 p.m. local time to train its baristas. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]   As Starbucks often tests new products as part of its ongoing innovation and transformation, Starbucks started testing selling an 8 oz ""short"" brewed coffee for $1 and giving free refills on all brewed coffee. This test was limited to the greater Seattle market, with no plans for expansion to national markets. Per an internal email this program was cancelled in late March 2008.          A typical sales area, this one in  Peterborough ,  UK , showing a display of food and the beverage preparation area       In March 2008, Schultz made several announcements to Starbucks  shareholders . Shultz introduced Starbucks' ""state of the art espresso system"", [ 17 ]  the  Thermoplan AG  manufactured Mastrena, which replaced their previous superauto, the Thermoplan Verismo 801(known internationally as the Thermoplan Black & White). Starbucks also announced that the company hopes to enter the energy drink market and introduce a customer reward program. Pre-ground beans will also no longer be used, in order that the additional grinding of all whole bean coffee will ""bring aroma, romance and theater"" to American stores. [ 18 ]  The company also announced the recent acquisition of The Coffee Equipment Company, [ 17 ]  the manufacturer of the Clover Brewing System. They are currently test marketing this unique ""fresh-pressed"" coffee system at six Starbucks locations, three in Seattle, and three in Boston. [ 19 ]   In May 2008, a rewards program was initiated for registered users of the Starbucks Card. Previously simply a gift card, the Starbucks Card has undergone a transition into a rewards card, similar to cards offered by other retail outlets. Perks and rewards offered to registered users are 2 hours of free Wi-Fi Internet service per day, free refills of brewed coffee (some locations only honour this for the first 3 hours of your stay), a free tall beverage with the purchase of 1 lb. of whole bean coffee, as well as free milk (e.g. soy) and syrup drink modifiers. [ 20 ]  This is a new and aggressive approach by Starbucks to create and strengthen customer loyalty.   Tags displaying the title ""Master"" are worn by employees who have completed the Coffee Master course, which educates employees in not only the tasting, but also growing regions, roasting, and purchasing (including  fair trade  practices) aspects of the coffee industry. Almost 70% of the coffee used by Starbucks around the world comes from the sixth major producer in the world,  Guatemala , a pro-organic producer.   Starting in November of 2008 Starbucks began selling Product Red goods. According to the website because of this they have been able to provide AIDS medicine for 3,800 for an entire year. [ 21 ]     [ edit ]   Intellectual property   Starbucks U.S. Brands, LLC, is a Starbucks-owned company that currently holds and owns the property rights to approximately 120 Starbucks Coffee Company patents and trademarks. It is located at 2525 Starbucks Way in  Minden, Nevada . [ 22 ]     [ edit ]   Name   The company is named in part after  Starbuck ,  Captain Ahab 's  first mate  in the book  Moby-Dick , as well as a turn-of-the-century mining camp ( Starbo  or  Storbo ) on  Mount Rainier . According to  Howard Schultz 's book  Pour Your Heart Into It: How Starbucks Built a Company One Cup at a Time , the name of the company was derived from  Moby-Dick , although not in as direct a fashion as many assume. Gordon Bowker liked the name ""Pequod"" (the ship in the novel), but his then creative partner Terry Heckler responded, ""No one's going to drink a cup of Pee-quod!"" Heckler suggested ""Starbo"". Brainstorming with these two ideas resulted in the company being named for the  Pequod' s first mate, Starbuck. [ 23 ]          A Starbucks location in the  insa-dong  district of  Seoul ,  South Korea . This particular location is a rarity in that the main sign is not written in  English .

[ 25 ]  The logo has been significantly streamlined over the years. In the first version, which gave the impression of an authentic 15th century European  woodcut , the Starbucks siren was topless and had a fully visible double fish tail. The image also had a rough visual texture. In the second version, which was used from 1987-92, her breasts were covered by her flowing hair, but her  navel  was still visible, and the fish tail was cropped slightly. In the current version, used since 1992, her navel and breasts are not visible at all, and only vestiges remain of the fish tails. The original ""woodcut"" logo can still be seen on the Starbucks store in Seattle's Pike Place Market, and on both the House Blend and Decaf House Blend packaging.   At the beginning of September 2006 and then again in early 2008, Starbucks temporarily reintroduced its original brown logo on paper hot drink cups. Starbucks has stated that this was done to show the company's heritage from the Pacific Northwest and to celebrate 35 years of business. The vintage logo sparked some controversy due in part to the siren's bare breasts, [ 26 ]  but the temporary switch garnered little attention from the media. Starbucks had drawn similar criticism when they reintroduced the vintage logo in 2006. [ 27 ]     [ edit ]   Parodies and infringements     [ edit ]   Environmental record          Starbucks inside  Tsutaya  in  Shibuya ,  Japan       In 1999, Starbucks started ""Grounds for your Garden"" to make their business more environment friendly. ""Grounds for your Garden"" is a year round program that gives leftover coffee grounds to anyone requesting it for composting. Although not all stores and regions participate, customers can request and rally their local Starbucks to begin the practice. In 2004, Starbucks began reducing the size of their paper napkins and store garbage bags, and lightening their solid waste production by 1.8 million pounds. [ 28 ] The U.S.  Food and Drug Administration  granted the first-ever approval to use recycled content in  food packaging  for Starbucks coffee cups. In 2005 Starbucks received the National Recycling Coalition Recycling Works Award. [ 29 ]  In 2008, Starbucks was ranked #15 on the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency 's list of Top 25 Green Power Partners for purchases of renewable energy. [ 30 ]   Starbucks has also received criticism from environmentalists. ""Dr. Allen Hershkowitz, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, says that Starbucks claimed they were using only 10 percent recycled material partly because the recycled material costs more."" [ 31 ]  In October 2008, The UK newspaper  The Sun  reported that Starbucks was wasting 23.4 million litres of water a day by leaving a tap constantly running for rinsing utensils in a ' dipper well ' in each of its stores worldwide. [ 32 ]   Does anyone know other environmental impact stats for Starbucks annually-- Asiachai  ( talk ) 17:30, 16 March 2009 (UTC)     [ edit ]   Criticism and controversy          Starbucks at the  Forbidden City  in  Beijing  (closed since July 2007)       Several activist groups maintain websites criticizing the company's  fair-trade  policies, labor relations, and environmental impact, and hold it as a prime example of U.S. cultural and economic  imperialism . Several Starbucks locations were vandalized during the  WTO   meeting held in Seattle in late 1999 .   The Starbucks location in the former imperial palace in Beijing closed in July 2007. The coffee shop had been a source of ongoing controversy since its opening in 2000 with protesters objecting that the presence of the American chain in this location ""was trampling on Chinese culture"". [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ]     [ edit ]   Anti-competitive tactics   Some of the methods Starbucks has used to expand and maintain their dominant market position include buying out competitors' leases, intentionally operating at a loss, and clustering several locations in a small geographical area (i.e., saturating the market), have been labeled anti-competitive by critics. [ 37 ]  For example, Starbucks fueled its initial expansion into the UK market with a buyout of Seattle Coffee Company, but then used its capital and influence to obtain prime locations, some of which operated at a financial loss. Critics claimed this was an unfair attempt to drive out small, independent competitors, who could not afford to pay inflated prices for premium real estate. [ 38 ]     [ edit ]   Labor disputes   Starbucks workers throughout seven different stores have joined the  Industrial Workers of the World  (IWW) as the  Starbucks Workers Union  since 2004. [ 39 ]          Starbucks in the  Financial District  of  Boston, Massachusetts       According to a Starbucks Union press release, since then, the union membership has begun expanding to Chicago and Maryland in addition to  New York City  where the movement originated. [ 40 ]  On March 7, 2006, the IWW and Starbucks agreed to a  National Labor Relations Board  settlement in which three Starbucks workers were granted almost US$2,000 in back wages and two fired employees were offered reinstatement. [ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ]  According to the Starbucks Union, on November 24, 2006, IWW members picketed Starbucks locations in more than 50 cities around the world in countries including Australia, Canada, Germany, and the UK, as well as U.S. cities including New York, Chicago, Minneapolis and San Francisco, [ 44 ]  to protest the firing of five Starbucks Workers Union organizers by Starbucks and to demand their reinstatement.   Some Starbucks baristas in Canada, [ 45 ]  Australia and New Zealand, [ 46 ]  and the United States [ 47 ]  belong to a variety of unions. In 2005, Starbucks paid out US$165,000 to eight employees at its Kent, Washington, roasting plant to settle charges that they had been retaliated against for being pro-union. At the time, the plant workers were represented by the  IUOE . Starbucks admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement. [ 39 ]          A Starbucks located in  Lima ,  Peru       A Starbucks strike occurred in  Auckland ,  New Zealand , on November 23, 2005. [ 46 ]  Organized by  Unite Union , workers sought secure hours, a  minimum wage  of NZ$12 an hour, and the abolition of youth rates. The company settled with the Union in 2006, resulting in pay increases, increased security of hours, and an improvement in youth rates. [ 48 ]   According to Starbucks Chairman Howard Schulz, ""If they had faith in me and my motives, they wouldn't need a union."" [ 49 ]  According to  The Seattle Times , ""The International Union of Operating Engineers Local 286 had trouble with Starbucks at its Kent roasting plant, where the union no longer represents workers"". [ 39 ]   In March 2008, Starbucks was ordered to pay  baristas  over  US$ 100 million in back tips in a  Californian   class action lawsuit  launched by baristas alleging that granting shift-supervisors a portion of  tips  violates state  labor laws . The Company plans to appeal. Similarly, an 18 year-old barista in Chestnut Hill, MA has just filed another suit with regards to the tipping policy. Massachusetts law also states that managers may not get a cut of tips.  [ 50 ] [ 51 ]  A similar lawsuit was also filed in Minnesota on March 27, 2008.  [ 52 ]     [ edit ]   Coffee bean market   In 2000, the company introduced a line of  fair trade  products. [ 53 ]   Of the approximately 136,000 tonnes (300 million pounds) of coffee Starbucks purchased in 2006, about 6 percent was certified as fair trade. [ 54 ]   According to Starbucks, they purchased 2,180 tonnes (4.8 million pounds) of Certified Fair Trade coffee in fiscal year 2004 and 5,220 tonnes (11.5 million pounds) in 2005. They have become the largest buyer of Certified Fair Trade coffee in North America (10% of the global market). Transfair USA, [ 55 ]  the only third-party certifier of Fair Trade Certified coffee in the United States, has noted the impact Starbucks has made in the area of Fair Trade and coffee farmer's lives by saying:       Since launching {its} FTC coffee line in 2000, Starbucks has undeniably made a significant contribution to family farmers through their rapidly growing FTC coffee volume. By offering FTC coffee in thousands of stores, Starbucks has also given the FTC label greater visibility, helping to raise consumer awareness in the process.       Groups such as  Global Exchange  are calling for Starbucks to further increase its sales of fair trade coffees. Fair trade certification can cost US$2,500 to US$10,000, based on the size of the producer group and length of time the inspections take, and many growers are unwilling or unable to pay for certification. [ 56 ]   Beyond Fair Trade Certification, Starbucks argues that it pays above market prices for all of its coffee. According to the company, in 2004 it paid on average $1.42 per pound ($2.64kg) for high-quality coffee beans. [ 57 ]  This is in comparison to commodity prices which were as low as $0.50$0.60 in 20032004. [ 58 ]     [ edit ]   Ethos water controversy          A Starbucks located in  Trujillo ,  Per       Ethos , a brand of bottled water acquired by Starbucks in 2005, is sold at locations throughout North America. Ethos bottles feature prominent labeling stating ""helping children get clean water"", referring to the fact that $.05 from each $1.80 bottle sold ($.10 per unit in Canada) is used to fund clean water projects in under-developed areas. Although sales of Ethos water have raised over $6,200,000 for clean water efforts, the brand is not a charity. Critics have argued that the claim on the label misleads consumers into thinking that Ethos is primarily a charitable organization, when it is actually a for-profit Starbucks brand and the vast majority of the sale price (97.2%) does not support clean-water projects. [ 59 ] [ 60 ]  The founders of Ethos have stated that the brand is intended to raise awareness of third-world clean water issues and provide socially responsible consumers with an opportunity to support the cause by choosing Ethos over other brands. [ 61 ]  Starbucks has since redesigned the American version of the Ethos water bottles, stating the amount of money donated per bottle in the description.     [ edit ]   Brighton store opens in breach of planning regulations   In May 2008, a branch of Starbucks was completed in  Kemptown  on St. James's Street,  Brighton, England , despite having being refused permission by the local planning authority, Brighton and Hove City Council. They claimed there were too many coffee shops already present on the street. [ 62 ] [ 63 ]  Starbucks has appealed the decision, with Brighton and Hove council monitoring the situation. [ 64 ]   Brighton & Hove City Council have served Starbucks with an enforcement notice (which they have appealed) to remove all tables and chairs from the premises in order to comply with planning regulations and operate as an A1 retail shop, rather than an A3 coffee shop/restaurant, for which they have no planning permission. The deadline of the enforcement is 20 February 2009. [ 65 ]     [ edit ]   Alleged relationship with the Israeli military   There have been calls for boycott of Starbucks stores and products because it is alleged that Starbucks sends part of its profits to the  Israeli military . [ 66 ]  It has been long alleged that Schultz is ""an active  Zionist ""  [ 67 ]  and is a recipient of several Israeli awards including ""The Israel 50th Anniversary Tribute Award"" for ""playing a key role in promoting a close alliance between the United States and Israel."" [ 68 ]  In response to these allegations Starbucks issued a statement saying Neither Chairman Howard Schultz nor Starbucks fund or support the Israeli Army. Starbucks is a non-political organization and does not support individual political causes. [ 69 ]  Starbucks has been a regular target of activists protesting against the  Israeli intervention in Gaza . Starbucks was forced to close a store in  Beirut ,  Lebanon  because of demonstrators shouting anti-Israel slogans and causing customers to flee. [ 70 ]  Protesters in Beirut told the  Associated Press  that they targeted Starbucks because they claim Chairman and CEO Howard Schultz donates money to the Israeli military. They hung several banners on the shop's window and used white tape to paste a  Star of David  over the green-and-white Starbucks sign. They also distributed a letter saying Schultz ""is one of the pillars of the American  Jewish lobby  and the owner of the Starbucks,"" which they said donates money to the Israeli military. [ 71 ]  Starbucks responded by saying ""Rumors that Starbucks Coffee Company and its management support Israel are unequivocally false. ... Starbucks is a nonpolitical organization and does not support political causes. Further, political preferences of a Starbucks partner [employee] at any level have absolutely no bearing on Starbucks company policies."" [ 72 ]     [ edit ]   Violence against Starbucks in the United Kingdom   On January 12, 2009, a Starbucks in Whitechapel Road in  London  was the target of vandalism by pro- Palestinian  demonstrators broke windows and reportedly ripped out fittings and equipment after clashes with riot police. Later the same day, after midnight, a suspected makeshift firebomb was hurled into the premises, causing further damage. [ 73 ] [ 74 ] [ 75 ]   On January 17, 2009, at an anti-Israel protest held by the  Stop the War Coalition  in  Trafalgar Square  in central  London , British Rapper  Lowkey  stated, with regard to Starbucks, that: ""You say you know about the Zionist lobby but you put money in their pockets every time youre buying their coffee."" After the rally, two groups of people, many wearing scarves over their faces, smashed and looted two Starbucks on Piccadilly and Shaftesbury Avenue. Although the Starbucks stores had requested greater police protection following the violence against a Starbucks the previous week,  Scotland Yard  stated it could ""not stop thugs hell-bent on causing damage."" [ 76 ] [ 74 ] [ 77 ] [ 78 ]     [ edit ]   Accusations by Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi   In a sermon delivered by Muslim cleric Sheikh  Yusuf al-Qaradawi , which aired on  Al Jazeera TV  on January 9, 2009 (as translated by MEMRI), Al-Qaradhawi accused Starbucks of supporting Israeli education and the Israeli Army and called for a boycott of the company and other western chains. [ 79 ]  Al-Qaradawi has previously called for a similar boycott of all US products with limited success. [ 80 ]  Starbucks has not commented directly on Al-Qaradawi's accusations, but has in the past, denied supporting Israel or any other political action. [ 73 ]     [ edit ]   Other ventures   Main article:  Hear Music   Starbucks entered the music industry in 1999 with the acquisition of Hear Music, and the film industry in 2006 with the creation of Starbucks Entertainment. Starbucks Entertainment was one of the producers of the 2006 film  Akeelah and the Bee . Retail stores heavily advertised the film before its release.   Hear Music is the brand name of Starbucks' retail music concept. Hear Music began as a catalog company in 1990 and was purchased by Starbucks in 1999. Nearly three years later, in 2002, they produced a Starbucks opera album, featuring artists such as  Luciano Pavarotti .     [ edit ]   Partnership with Apple   Starbucks has agreed to a partnership with  Apple  to collaborate on selling music as part of the coffeehouse experience. In October 2006, Apple added a Starbucks Entertainment area to the  iTunes Store , selling similar music that appeared in Starbucks stores. In September 2007 Apple announced that there would be wireless communication between Apple and Starbucks. Through the AT&T Wi-Fi, a paywall is opened up to allow any individual connecting to AT&T wifi access to the  iTunes Store  (regardless of whether he or she is an AT&T subscriber). The partnership is primarily targeted at  iPhone ,  iPod Touch , and  Macbook  users (although anyone with access to iTunes can take advantage of it). In addition, the iTunes Store will automatically detect the current and last 10 songs playing in a Starbucks and offer users connected to the store's wireless network the opportunity to download the tracks. This feature has been rolled out in  Seattle ,  New York City , and the  San Francisco Bay Area , and will slowly be offered in limited markets during 20072008. [ 81 ]  During the fall of 2007, Starbucks also began to sell digital downloads of certain albums through iTunes. The buyer would buy the download at Starbucks, and enter the code on the download card at the iTunes Store, and then the entire album would immediately start downloading. From October 2 to November 7, 2007, Starbucks gave away 37 different songs for free download through iTunes as part of the ""Song of the Day"" promotion. Each day, baristas would give out download cards for a particular song which could be redeemed on iTunes. Currently, every Tuesday, a new ""Pick of the Week"" download card is available at Starbucks for a free song download, similar to its previous ""Song of the Day.""

Last year about this time  Howard Schultz sent a memo  to his Starbucks executive team challenging them to get smarter about how they are running the company and to get back to the company's core business.  Starbucks CEO Jim Donald was charged with driving sales and driving innovation at the company.  In 2007, Starbucks stock value fell 48% and the company reported its first every year-over-year drop in customer traffic.  Donald is out and  Schultz is back as CEO .   The jury is still deliberating on Michael Dell and the turnaround of his company.   The jury is just convening about Howard Schultz and the turnaround of his company.

Posted in      Notes & Updates    |  No Comments »                     Starbucks Television Advertising                         What?  On a  conference call with Wall Street analysts , Starbucks Coffee revealed fewer customers are visiting its stores and that year-over-year sales are stagnant.  The company  reported a 1.0% drop in customer traffic  as compared to the same period last year and despite two price increases, same store sales increased only 4.0% from the year prior.   In response, Starbucks announced a three-point plan to reverse their sluggish financial numbers. First, the company will attempt to sharpen its store-level operations to better deliver the “Starbucks Experience” customers have come to expect. Second, the company will focus on introducing new beverages that are more innovative and more appealing to customers. Third, Starbucks will l aunch a national television advertising campaign  in hopes of driving new customers into its stores as well as getting current customers to visit more often.   So What?  Since being a publicly traded company, Starbucks has never experienced a reduction in customer visits. Remarkably, they have always had more customers visiting its stores … until now. This is uncharted territory for Starbucks. And Starbucks is concerned.    Additionally, for nearly a decade, year-over-year sales at Starbucks have been very strong—anywhere from 7.0% to 13.0%. So the current trend where comp sales are stagnate in the low single-digits is quite alarming for Starbucks.   For many companies, the answer to the question of, “Sales are down and customer counts are falling, what should we do?” is to spend marketing dollars on creating a television-heavy advertising campaign. That hasn’t been the answer at Starbucks.   Starbucks has always followed the unconventional strategy of using its in-store experience as its main marketing tool. Everything about the Starbucks experience marketed the Starbucks business: the coffee in the iconic white logo cup, the personal interaction between a customer and a Starbucks barista, the in-store decor, the music playing overhead, the welcoming smell of the coffee, and the feeling customers had during their Starbucks “moment.”   As noted  in the conference call , Starbucks will continue down the unconventional path of spending marketing dollars to improve the customer’s in-store experience through better store operations and more appealing beverages.   But now, the company has also decided to follow the more conventional path to arresting declining sales through  launching a television advertising campaign .   According to Ad Age , we can expect to see three Holiday-focused animated 30-second spots running on select cable channels and network television channels.    This dramatic change in marketing strategy goes to show us how seriously the company is taking the soft comp sales and declining transaction comps. Starbucks is willing to risk its go-to-market strategy by spending significant monies on television ads to lure customers during the Holiday season.    To this marketer, it’s a little foolish to spend advertising dollars on television during the Holiday season without going all-out. I doubt Starbucks is putting mega-millions behind this television push. With so many retailers spending mega-millions on television advertising during the Holiday shopping season, the limited advertising spend from Starbucks is sure to get lost in all the ad clutter. Plus, I get the feeling these commercials will be go hard on pushing the relevance of the Starbucks brand during the Holidays and go very soft on selling specific products.   A smarter spend for Starbucks would be to go all-out during the Spring/Summer months and use television advertising to promote their promotion-friendly Frappuccino blended beverages. Starbucks has always treated their Frappuccino drinks as being more promotional than their other coffee drinks. For years, Starbucks has done regional radio, billboard, and print advertising to support their Frappuccino portfolio. They’ve come to believe this advertising push positively impacts sales and drives in new customers.   So why doesn’t Starbucks wait until the Spring/Summer months to go all-out with national television advertising? With sales already sluggish and customer traffic trending downward, the company doesn’t want to get too far behind their FY’08 sales goals. Keep in mind, Starbucks will generate around 25% of its 2008 sales during the six-weeks of Holiday. If the company falls behind early in hitting sales targets, 2008 could be a very rough year.   I believe this national television advertising push is a sign Starbucks is desperate to drive sales. Desperate enough to turn its back on the marketing strategy that has made Starbucks what it is today.   What Now?   We all get to sit back,  watch the Starbucks television commercials , and watch to see what impact this new marketing direction has on the Starbucks business and the Starbucks brand.                      Posted in      Notes & Updates    |  No Comments »                     Espresso Shots of Business Wisdom                         Aug.25, 2007  | On my day-to-day blog,  Brand Autopsy , I've started a series of audio/video postings sharing  Espresso Shots of Business Wisdom .  Each episode runs less than five minutes and shares business advice I've picked up through the years.  Much of this advice is from my days working inside Starbucks Coffee.  For more,  visit the Brand Autopsy blog .

If you haven’t read it, you can  read it here .   He’s concerned Starbucks is in danger of losing its soul, its uniqueness—its remarkability. Howard says the romance and theater of coffee have disappeared from Starbucks stores because Baristas now use push-button machines to make espresso drinks. That stores no longer smell like coffee and that every store looks cookie-cutter.    Howard closes the email by asking his executive team to get smarter about the business and to get more innovative to once again differentiate Starbucks.   Hmm … since we’ve all been to Starbucks (some of us more than once-a-day), we’re more than qualified to answer the same strategic question Howard asks of his executive team.           So, send me an  EMAIL   with  STARBUCKS  in the subject line. Tell me what Starbucks must do to reclaim its uniqueness? To better connect with customers? To become the coffee company it once was?    My plan is to compile your answers into a free ebook. (Of course that’s contingent upon receiving good answers.) So in your responses … don’t ramble. Be brief. Be smart. Be fast. I’d like to have this ebook posted by the end of March.           NOTE: Blatant inspiration from  Seth Godin  and his  What Should Google Do?  ebook.                Posted in      Notes & Updates    |  No Comments »                     Howards Concerns Are Not New                         Feb. 24   |  Howard Schultz, Starbucks Chairman and chief visionary,  recently sent a battle cry email  to key executives warning them of how decisions the company has made in the past 10 years is resulting in the commoditization of the Starbucks experience.  ( Read the entire email here .)   Howard is concerned Starbucks is not the same company it once was. He fears key decisions have led to “the watering down of the Starbucks experience."" And he challenged his executive team to guide Starbucks back to its core roots of being a coffee company.     As a former Starbucks marketer who worked at Starbucks from Oct. ’94 until Jan. ’03, nothing Howard says is new. Every decision Howard singles out in the memo as being damaging to the brand has sparked countless heated debates between old school Starbucks partners and new school Starbucks partners. I know. As one of the old school-minded Starbucks partners, I passionately objected to the introduction of automated espresso machines. I also was involved in intense discussions over the loss of coffee aroma in Starbucks locations.    These warning signs Howard mentions in the email of succumbing to the fast food mentality, the lost focus on coffee, and the commoditization of the Starbucks experience have been present for a long time.    In fact, there’s a vintage internal presentation from Starbucks which details the branding conundrum Howard highlights. That presentation is from February 4, 1999 and it’s just as relevant to the Starbucks brand today as it ways eight-years ago.  One telling slide says:                      Posted in      Notes & Updates    |  No Comments »                     Howard Schultzs Open Letter to Starbucks Partners                         Feb. 14, 2007  |  According to the Seattle Times , Starbucks Chairman, Howard Schultz, felt the need to send Starbucks employees a pep-talk letter.    Obviously Howard is bothered by some recent, but unnamed, criticism directed at Starbucks.      In my eight-years at Starbucks, Howard was never bothered enough to send such a letter to all employees.    On many occasions though, he would leave impassioned voicemails to all Starbucks stores.    However, voicemails are not able to reach all employees at all stores.    Only the store management team, including assistant managers and shift supervisors, listen to voicemails.    So sending a letter to every employee says a lot.      Read for yourself by clicking below:                        Posted in      Notes & Updates    |  No Comments »                     TRIBAL KNOWLEDGE in Entrepreneur Magazine                         Jan. 20, 2007  | The February issue of Entrepreneur Magazine includes an article highlighting recent books about Starbucks Coffee.  TRIBAL KNOWLEDGE is mentioned and the writer, Ken Henricks, drops in a few quotes from me about the importance of treating employees well if businesses seek to treat customers well.     Click below to access a .jpeg of the article.                      Posted in      Notes & Updates    |  No Comments »                     Starbucks Mailbag #6                         Jan. 3, 2007  | This is another installment of the “Starbucks Mailbag” posting where I give a perspective on questions I’ve received about Starbucks strategies and decisions.    This morning I received an email from a friend wanting to learn more about how Starbucks developed the culture of customers customizing their drinks. This friend is working with a quick service restaurant that’s considering implementing a “customizable” drink marketing program. He wants to know how they might be able to approach this “customizable” drink program like Starbucks has done. Interesting question and you may find my response interesting …   ***********************************   ""Kerry"" … I think the whole drink customization capability at Starbucks came about through the evolution of its business and not from an act of marketing creation.   Back when the Starbucks menu was limited (just whole milk, two flavor syrups, no caramel, no Frappuccino, etc), customers had limited ways to customize their SBUX coffee.     But coffee has always been a customizable beverage.  Everyone has their own ritual to concocting the perfect cup for them.  Back in the day, it was adding a specific number of sugar lumps.     Today, it's evolved considerably with customers having a variety of options, to customization today being able to add 1 pack Equal, 1 pack Sweet-N-Low, 1 pump Hazelnut, etc to any coffee drink at Starbucks.   Starbucks promoted drink customization in the 80s & 90s through its Baristas and not through customer-facing marketing signage.  Baristas told customers how they liked to customize their Latte and their Brewed Coffee and because customers valued the opinions of Starbucks Baristas, they ended up customizing their drinks in similar fashion.    From there, the customization brand aspect of Starbucks has evolved to the extent that I've heard there are up to 50,000 ways a Starbucks drink can be customized.  (I've also heard that customization number to closer to 20,000.  Either way, it’s a considerable number.)   Another aspect to consider is how this customization evolved from the Starbucks drink language.  (You know what I am talking about—Half-Caf, Double Tall, Non-Fat, No Foam Latte.  That’s the Starbucks drink language.)  Starbucks created its drink language to help make drink preparation more uniform resulting in faster delivery and greater consistency from store-to-store.  Once that language was codified and Starbucks Baristas had a systematic way to craft coffee drinks, it became apparent to customers that they could customize a beverage in a seemingly infinite number of ways.   This was all a natural business evolution process spurred on by  doing  rather than  saying .    To clarify this point, think back to 2004 when Starbucks ran an in-store and out-of-store promotion called CUSTOMIZE YOUR CUP.  A fancy booklet was produced explaining how drinks can be customized and some out-of-store print ads ran.  This full-on marketing approach didn't really work too well because it felt contrived and not a natural by-product of the Starbucks Experience.   Customers laughed at the booklet  thinking it treated them as being stupid , that (a) they didn't know you could customize a beverage and (b) here's Starbucks getting pedantic by showing how to customize a beverage using elementary language.  There's something to be said for having a ""hidden menu"" and allowing customers to ""hijack"" the brand without superficial prodding.  ( Just ask In-N-Out .)   As for a quick service restaurant seeking to emulate Starbucks success in crafting a customized drink culture with customers… my advice is to first get employees jazzed about customizing drinks.  That excitement from employees should get passed onto to customers——like it did at Starbucks.   ***********************************    If you have a burning Starbucks-related question but never knew who to ask,  use the contact form and ask me .

Back in the day, people used to line up outside the doors of Starbucks locations in the Pacific Northwest so they could be one of the first folks to enjoy Christmas Blend on the morning it went on sale.  At least that’s the company campfire story that still gets passed around today.     I’m not sure the  anticipation  for Christmas Blend exists today like it did back in the day.  Nevertheless, when Starbucks starts serving Christmas Blend it still signals the start of the Holiday season for many people, including me.       As a former long-time Starbucks marketer, I’m well-versed in the lore of Christmas Blend.  I’ve even managed to save a few old school marketing materials sharing the lore of Christmas.  One of my favorite old-school Starbucks Christmas Blend marketing materials is this advertisement from the early 90s.

""     ***********************************    Patty, you bring a valid point.    The pastries Starbucks serves are not as good as the coffee it serves.    When I was at Starbucks, the mantra was, “Coffee is the core, but food is the opportunity.”    Improving its food offerings is something Starbucks has been trying to do for a long time.    It seems like now the company is more concerned with delivering consistency with its pastries from a store in California to a store in Connecticut than it is in delivering the best quality pastry.    There are many reasons for this.   As Starbucks gets bigger and bigger, they are “nationalizing” more and more of their pastry offerings.    You’ll find that many of the pastries served at Starbucks locations are of the “thaw and serve” variety.    An increasing number of pasties are air-shipped to Starbucks frozen and then are thawed at the store before being placed in the pastry counter.   Artisan and local bakeries have trouble meeting the day-in-day-out increasing demands of supplying Starbucks with fresh pastries. With Starbucks fast-paced growth, they have created a monster that artisan bakeries have difficulty feeding.   Starbucks would no doubt increase sales if they were able to make their pastry offerings more than merely satisfactory. However, as mentioned earlier, beverage is boss at Starbucks.  Since the company excels at preparing and selling coffee beverages, it is easier for Starbucks to impact sales by introducing new, higher-prices beverages than to overhaul its food program.   ***********************************    If you have a burning Starbucks-related question but never knew who to ask,  use the contact form and ask me . My answer to your question might appear in a future Starbucks Mailbag posting.                    Posted in      Notes & Updates    |  No Comments »                     Starbucks Mailbag #4                         Oct. 5,  2006  | In the comments section of  Tribal Truth #33, Judy asked me  …  ""Can you tell me what it means to create an employee experience? How do the best companies ensure that the employee experience is aligned to the customer experience?""   ***********************************    [My answer]   Whoa … that’s a loaded question Judy. Simplistically speaking, creating meaningful employee experiences revolves around making the company something employees can believe in ( Tribal Truth #32 ). It’s also about a company realizing that its products do not make great brands but rather, its people make brands great ( Tribal Truth #37 ).    The best companies, namely those listed as one of  Fortune Magazine’s ""100 Best Companies to Work for in America ,""  spend just as much time marketing to its employees as it does to its customers. In other words, these companies realize that happy, knowledgeable employees will usually translate into happy, knowledgeable customers.     For example …  The Container Store  is a Dallas-based privately held company specializing in selling boxes, bins, and everything in-between to help consumers organize all their stuff. They have been highly successful with sales in 2005 topping $425 million with just 37 locations in 12 states.    New Container Store employees are given more than 240 hours of training in their first year compared with the industry standard of 7 hours of training per new employee. Employees are paid two-to-three times more than the industry average. And employees are given a generous 40% discount for anything purchased at the Container Store. The company is renowned by retailers and customers as delivering great customer experiences which helps to explain why the company is so successful.   With its focus on making the employee experience matter ( Tribal Truth #33 ), The Container Store astonishes its employees who in turn, astonish its customers with great customer service.    Given the Container Store example, one sure-fire way to ensure the employee experience is aligned with the customer experience is to treat employees like you would want employees to treat customers. Sounds simple. But if it was so simple, more companies would be doing it … right?   ***********************************   If you have a burning Starbucks-related question but never knew who to ask,  use the contact form and ask me .

Jeremy  (Boise, ID) emailed me a question about the iconic Starbucks paper cups …  “I love the regular logo on the white cup. During the  Holiday  season, they change the design of the cups. Does the design change really boost sales that much?”   ***********************************    [My answer]   Hmm … interesting question Jeremy.    To mark the Holiday season, Starbucks cups change from its regular white logo’d look to a festive red color design.    Does this cup design change boost sales?    I’m not sure Starbucks has data which isolates the Holiday cup design as being a factor in boosting sales during the Holidays.    Sales at Starbucks always increase during the Holidays for a variety of reasons including … customers buy more merchandise at this time because of the gift buying season, six weeks of social shopping outings with friends and family seems to always include drinking coffee, wintry weather always drives more hot coffee beverages purchases, etc.   As you can tell, it is tough to isolate the red Holiday cup design from all the other factors helping to increase sales during this time.    By the way, Starbucks will generate almost 25% of its yearly sales during the six-week long Holiday shopping season with many Starbucks stores doubling their average weekly sales during these six weeks.   What the red cup does is very  Pavlovian  in that it triggers something with Starbucks customers to recognize it is the Holiday season. As crazy as it sounds … customers seem to await the red Holiday cup as it helps to put them in the “Christmas Spirit.”    It also, and maybe more importantly, puts in-store employees (Baristas) in more of a Holiday mood.   ***********************************    If you have a burning Starbucks-related question but never knew who to ask,  use the contact form and ask me .

Posted in      Notes & Updates    |  No Comments »                     Starbucks Mailbag #2                         Sept. 16, 2006  | This is the second installment of the “Starbucks Mailbag” where I give a  former  insider's perspective on questions I’ve received about Starbucks strategies and decisions.   Eddy  emailed me with this double-barreled question …  “Why does Starbucks not scoop beans and instead sells pre-bagged coffee ?""   ***********************************     [My answer]  Eddy, the decision to not scoop beans and instead use primarily use pre-packaged coffee comes down to issues of efficiency and quality.     Up until the late 90s, Starbucks scooped every bag of beans sold.    But scooping, weighing, and bagging beans takes time—time that most Starbucks customers do not appreciate.    Starbucks customers would rather pick-up a pre-bagged pound of coffee than wait the time it takes a Barista to do it.    As you can surmise, these efficiency gains result in greater financial/profitability for the company because it takes less store-level employee labor to bag beans.   To an extent, these efficiency gains are offset by the loss of aroma and theater.    Starbucks stores today do not smell like Starbucks stores did in the past.    Since very little scooping of beans takes place, stores do not have as strong of a coffee aroma as they used to.    Plus, there is very little theater in a customer plucking a bag of beans off a floor display.    Part of the “Starbucks Experience” used to be the theater of having a Barista scoop, weigh, bag, and place a stamp on each bag of coffee sold.    That theater doesn’t happen much these days at Starbucks.   Selling pre-packaged coffee is also a quality issue.    The quality of the pre-packaged coffee is improved in many ways because there is a one-way value in each pre-packaged bag which releases gasses that roasted beans give off.    Simply put, this one-way valve (known as a “Flavorlock” valve) allows coffee beans to not get stale.  Sure, there is a more complicated explanation but that begins to explain it.   ***********************************    If you have a burning Starbucks-related question but never knew who to ask,  use the contact form and ask me .

In TRIBAL KNOWLEDGE, I share many of my thoughts from experiencing the strategies devised and the decisions made firsthand. However, I couldn’t share every thought because the book would have become too choppy and too wayward.   Hmm … choppy and wayward?    That’ll make for great Tribal Knowledge blog fodder, eh?     So, every month from here on out, I’ll be answering some of the Starbucks-related questions I’ve been asked over the years.    And if you have a burning Starbucks-related question but never knew who to ask,  use the contact form and ask me . My answer to your question might appear in a future Starbucks Mailbag posting.   ***********************************    Our first question comes from  Blythe Christopher de Orive .    Bkyth asks,  ""Who came up with the brilliant idea of marketing CDs at the counter? Was it synergy between the record companies and Starbucks or can you trace it to one individual?""   ***********************************   [My answer]  Not sure this can be traced to one specific individual … more like a trial/error process than anything else. Starbucks has tried to sell many different things at the counter from finger puppets to hard candy to granola-like bars. The real estate space at the main POS (point of sale) is extremely political (and highly profitable) with lots of discussion behind the scenes at Starbucks.      The decision to sell CDs at the POS most likely came about because (a) CDs sell well as an “impulse buy” and (b) the increased visibility of music CDs at the POS helps to promote Starbucks as a player in the music business.   But another reason to consider is “shrinkage.”    No, I’m not talking about  George Costanza shrinkage  but rather, the type of shrinkage where inventory shrinks due to theft from customers or employees. Starbucks loses a lot of CDs to theft because they lack security screeners and because they merchandise CDs on racks in out-of-sight corners in its stores. Think about it, every music retailer has security screeners to reduce theft.    Not Starbucks.    Since its stores are heavily trafficked, it’s pretty easy to swipe CDs without a Starbucks barista (employee) noticing.   However, when you place CDs at the main POS where a barista is deployed it becomes more difficult to steal a CD.      Next time you see a used CD store located near a Starbucks, riffle through their CD compilations section.    Chances are very high you’ll notice many Starbucks/Hear Music CDs still in pristine shrinkwrap condition.    And know you know the rest of the story.    (Wait, I can’t use that line.    Someone else has dibs on it.    Drats.)                Posted in      Notes & Updates    |  Comments (2) »                     Notes & Updates                         AUGUST 2006  | For a company that has accomplished so much, it’s surprising how little the business world really knows how Starbucks found prosperity from selling a commodity. That’s because much of this company’s sage advice and weathered truths exist solely in the hearts and minds of longtime Starbucks partners (employees).    Starbucks Tribal Knowledge is an innate language that has never been written, only spoken, and then, only within the Starbucks tribe.     It’s a pithy quote by a respected Starbucks executive. It’s a mantra used by Starbucks project teams to bring forth passionate followership. It’s emotionally intense advice from old-school Starbucks partners. It’s “a-ha moments” from successful (and failed) projects. It’s poignant. It’s thought-provoking. It’s actionable. It’s what built Starbucks the business and Starbucks the brand.   It’s time for those outside the Starbucks tribe to have access to this knowledge.     As a former, long-time Starbucks marketer, it is my hope more businesses follow the endearing and enduring principles the Starbucks business was built upon.    That’s exactly why I wrote TRIBAL KNOWLEDGE and why this companion website exists.    In this companion website, you can  PREVIEW  the book by reading a sample chapter and familiarize yourself with all the  TRIBAL TRUTHS  discussed in the book.    Plus, I’ve included other goodies in the  EXTRAS & LINKS  section.

The following letter is a typical                  reponse to those concerns sent by Starbucks to a concerned consumer                  in London.                 Thank-you for contacting Starbucks Coffee Company.                 Thank-you for your inquiry regarding genetic modification of                  Starbucks foods. We recognize that this issue is of increasing                  concern to our customers. At Starbucks we have a long standing                  commitment to address the social and environmental effects of                  our business  (for                  the real truth, click here)  and are actively                  seeking to understand the agricultural issues related to our foods                  and beverages.                 Beginning with our coffee, our research has shown that all of                  our coffee beans are free from genetic modification  (so                  far this is true, but Starbucks has not agreed to avoid GE coffee                  once it's on the market.   To learn                  more of the truth, click here) . Also, to the                  best of our knowledge, none of our products contain genetically                  modified ingredients.

A San Diego judge on Thursday ordered coffee giant Starbucks to pay more than $100-million in tips and interest owed to staff across outlets in California.   San Diego Superior Court Judge Patricia Cowett ruled in favour of a barista from a store in La Jolla who filed a lawsuit in 2004 arguing that supervisors were unfairly receiving a share of pooled tips from customers.   Lawyers for Jou Chou had argued that Starbucks was breaching state law by allowing supervisors to receive tips instead of paying them a higher salary.

Starbucks is the largest  coffeehouse  company in the world, [ 2 ]  with 16,120 stores in 44 countries. [ 3 ]  Starbucks sells  drip brewed coffee ,  espresso -based hot drinks, other hot and cold drinks, snacks, and items such as mugs and coffee beans. Through the Starbucks Entertainment division and  Hear Music  brand, the company also markets books, music, and film. Many of the company's products are seasonal or specific to the locality of the store. Starbucks-brand ice cream and coffee are also sold at grocery stores.   From Starbucks' founding in Seattle as a local  coffee bean  roaster and retailer, the company has expanded rapidly. In the 1990s, Starbucks was opening a new store every workday, a pace that continued into the 2000s. Domestic growth has since slowed, although the company continues to expand in foreign markets and will open a net of 900 new stores outside of the U.S. in 2009. [ 4 ]  The first location outside of the United States and Canada was established in 1990s, and they now constitute almost one third of Starbucks' stores. [ 5 ]   By late March 2008, Starbucks had more than 16,226 stores worldwide, including 11,434 stores located in the United States. On July 1, 2008, the company announced it was closing 600 under-performing company-owned stores and cutting U.S. expansion plans amid growing economic uncertainty. [ 6 ] [ 7 ]  On July 29, 2008, Starbucks also cut almost 1,000 non-retail jobs as part of its bid to re-energize the brand and boost its profit. Of the new cuts, 550 of the positions are layoffs and the rest are unfilled jobs. [ 8 ]  These closings and layoffs have effectively ended the companys period of growth and expansion that began in the mid-1990s.   On January 28, 2009, Starbucks announced the closure of an additional 300 under-performing stores, and the elimination of 7,000 positions. CEO Howard Schultz also announced that he had received board approval to reduce his salary to $10,000 per year.

Located in the old Sears, Roebuck and Co. catalog distribution center building.       The original Starbucks was opened in Pike Place Market in Seattle, Washington, in 1971 by three partners: English teacher  Jerry Baldwin , history teacher  Zev Siegel , and writer  Gordon Bowker . The three were inspired by  Alfred Peet , whom they knew personally, to open their first store in  Pike Place Market  to sell high-quality coffee beans and equipment. The original Starbucks location was at 2000 Western Avenue from 19711976. That store then moved to 1912 Pike Place; it is still open. During their first year of operation, they purchased green  coffee beans  from  Peet's , then began buying directly from growers.   Entrepreneur  Howard Schultz  joined the company in 1983, and, after a trip to  Milan, Italy , advised that the company should sell coffee and  espresso  drinks as well as beans. The owners rejected this idea, believing that getting into the beverage business would distract the company from its primary focus. To them,  coffee  was something to be prepared in the home. Certain that there was much money to be made selling drinks to on-the-go Americans, Schultz started the  Il Giornale  coffee bar chain in 1985.   In 1984, the original owners of Starbucks, led by Baldwin, took the opportunity to purchase Peet's (Baldwin still works there today). In 1987, they sold the Starbucks chain to Schultz's Il Giornale, which rebranded the Il Giornale outlets as Starbucks and quickly began to expand. Starbucks opened its first locations outside Seattle at  Waterfront Station  in  Vancouver ,  British Columbia , and  Chicago ,  Illinois , that same year. At the time of its  initial public offering  on the stock market in 1992, Starbucks had grown to 165 outlets.    The first Starbucks location outside of North America opened in  Tokyo  in 1996. Starbucks entered the  U.K.  market in 1998 with the acquisition of the then 60-outlet, UK-based Seattle Coffee Company, re-branding all its stores as Starbucks. By November 2005,  London  had more outlets than  Manhattan , [ 10 ]  a sign of Starbucks becoming an international brand.          A Starbucks coffee shop in  Leeds ,  United Kingdom       In 1999, Starbucks experimented with eateries in the San Francisco Bay area through a restaurant chain called Circadia. [ 11 ]  These restaurants were soon ""outed"" as Starbucks establishments and converted to Starbucks cafes.   In April 2003, Starbucks completed the purchase of  Seattle's Best Coffee  and  Torrefazione Italia  from  AFC Enterprises , bringing the total number of Starbucks-operated locations worldwide to more than 6,400. On September 14, 2006, rival  Diedrich Coffee  announced that it would sell most of its company-owned retail stores to Starbucks. This sale includes the company-owned locations of the Oregon-based  Coffee People  chain. Starbucks has converted the Diedrich Coffee and Coffee People locations to Starbucks as of summer 2007, although the Portland airport Coffee People locations were excluded from the sale.  [ 12 ] [ 13 ]   Starbucks' chairman,  Howard Schultz , has talked about making sure growth does not dilute the company's culture  [ 14 ]  and the common goal of the company's leadership to act like a small company.          The first Starbucks branch.       In January 2008, Chairman  Howard Schultz  resumed his roles as President and Chief Executive Officer after an eight year hiatus, and replaced Jim Donald, who took those posts in 2005 but decided to leave the company in late 2007. Schultz's principal challenge is to restore what he calls the ""distinctive Starbucks experience"" in the face of rapid expansion. Analysts believe that Schultz must determine how to contend with higher materials prices and enhanced competition from lower-price fast food chains, including  McDonald's  and  Dunkin' Donuts . On January 31, 2008, Schultz announced that Starbucks would discontinue its warm breakfast sandwich products, originally scheduled to launch nationwide in 2008, in order to refocus the brand on all things coffee.   As Starbucks often tests new products as part of its ongoing innovation and transformation, Starbucks started testing selling an 8 oz ""short"" brewed coffee for $1 and giving free refills on all brewed coffee. This test was limited to the greater Seattle market, with no plans for expansion to national markets. Per an internal email this program was cancelled in late March 2008.          A typical sales area, this one in  Peterborough ,  UK , showing a display of food and the beverage preparation area       In March 2008, Schultz made several announcements to Starbucks  shareholders . Shultz introduced Starbucks' ""state of the art espresso system"", [ 15 ]  the  Thermoplan AG  manufactured Mastrena, which replaced their previous superauto, the Thermoplan Verismo 801(known internationally as the Thermoplan Black & White). Starbucks also announced that the company hopes to enter the energy drink market and introduce a customer reward program. Pre-ground beans will also no longer be used, in order that the additional grinding of all whole bean coffee will ""bring aroma, romance and theater"" to American stores.  [ 16 ]  The company also announced the recent acquisition of The Coffee Equipment Company, [ 15 ]  the manufacturer of the Clover Brewing System. They are currently test marketing this unique ""fresh-pressed"" coffee system at six Starbucks locations, three in Seattle, and three in Boston. [ 17 ]   In May 2008, a rewards program was initiated for registered users of the Starbucks Card. Previously simply a gift card, the Starbucks Card has undergone a transition into a rewards card, similar to cards offered by other retail outlets. Perks and rewards offered to registered users are 2 hours of free Wi-Fi Internet service per day, free refills of brewed coffee, a free tall beverage with the purchase of 1 lb. of whole bean coffee, as well as free milk (e.g. soy) and syrup drink modifiers.  [ 18 ]  This is a new and aggressive approach by Starbucks to create and strengthen customer loyalty.   Tags displaying the title ""Master"" are worn by employees who have completed the Coffee Master course, which educates employees in not only the tasting, but also growing regions, roasting, and purchasing (including  fair trade  practices) aspects of the coffee industry. Almost the 70% of the coffee used by Starbucks around the world came from the sixth major producer in the world,  Guatemala , a pro-organic producer.     [ edit ]   Intellectual property   Starbucks U.S. Brands, LLC, is a Starbucks-owned company that currently holds and owns the property rights to approximately 120 Starbucks Coffee Company patents and trademarks. It is located at 2525 Starbucks Way in  Minden, Nevada . [ 19 ]     [ edit ]   Name   The company is named in part after  Starbuck ,  Captain Ahab 's  first mate  in the book  Moby-Dick , as well as a turn-of-the-century mining camp ( Starbo  or  Storbo ) on  Mount Rainier . According to  Howard Schultz 's book  Pour Your Heart Into It: How Starbucks Built a Company One Cup at a Time , the name of the company was derived from  Moby-Dick , although not in as direct a fashion as many assume. Gordon Bowker liked the name ""Pequod"" (the ship in the novel), but his then creative partner Terry Heckler responded, ""No one's going to drink a cup of Pee-quod!"" Heckler suggested ""Starbo"". Brainstorming with these two ideas resulted in the company being named for the  Pequod' s first mate, Starbuck. [ 20 ]          A Starbucks location in  Seoul ,  South Korea . This particular location is very unique and rare in that it has no sign written in  English .       International names include:     Arabic -speaking countries:  (transliteration:  strbaks )   Bulgaria :  (transliteration:  Starbks )   China ,  Hong Kong ,  Macau ,  Taiwan :   Pinyin : xngbk ( xng means ""star"", while  is a  transliteration  of ""-bucks"")   Israel :  (transliteration:  srbaqs )   Japan :  (transliteration:  sutbakkusu , phonological:  staa-bahkss )   Russia :  (transliteration:  Starbaks )   South Korea :  (transliteration:  seutabeokseu ), often used in conjunction with the English name   Quebec ,  Canada : Caf Starbucks Coffee [ 21 ]   Thailand :  pronounced  [satbk]       [ edit ]   Logo          Original brown logo              ""Abraxas"" - Louvre       Valerie O'Neil, a Starbucks spokeswoman, said that the logo is an image of a ""twin-tailed siren"" (the  siren  of  Greek mythology ). [ 22 ]  The logo has been significantly streamlined over the years. In the first version, which gave the impression of an authentic 15th century European  woodcut , the Starbucks siren was topless and had a fully visible double fish tail. The image also had a rough visual texture. In the second version, which was used from 1987-92, her breasts were covered by her flowing hair, but her  navel  was still visible, and the fish tail was cropped slightly. In the current version, used since 1992, her navel and breasts are not visible at all, and only vestiges remain of the fish tails. The original ""woodcut"" logo can still be seen on the Starbucks store in Seattle's Pike Place Market, and on both the House Blend and Decaf House Blend packaging.   At the beginning of September 2006 and then again in early 2008, Starbucks temporarily reintroduced its original brown logo on paper hot drink cups. Starbucks has stated that this was done to show the company's heritage from the Pacific Northwest and to celebrate 35 years of business. The vintage logo sparked some controversy due in part to the siren's bare breasts, [ 23 ]  but the temporary switch garnered little attention from the media. Starbucks had drawn similar criticism when they reintroduced the vintage logo in 2006. [ 24 ]     [ edit ]   Parodies and infringements   In 2000,  San Francisco   cartoonist   Kieron Dwyer  was sued by Starbucks for copyright and trademark infringement after creating a parody of its siren logo and putting it on coffee mugs, t-shirts, and stickers that he sold on his website and at comic book conventions. Dwyer felt that since his work was a parody it was protected by his right to  free speech  under U.S. law. The judge agreed that Dwyer's work was a parody and thus enjoyed constitutional protection; however, he was forbidden from financially ""profiting"" from using a ""confusingly similar"" image of the Starbucks siren logo. Dwyer is currently allowed to display the image as an expression of free speech, but he can no longer sell it. [ 25 ]   In 2003, Starbucks successfully sued a  Shanghai  competitor in  China  for  trademark infringement , because that chain used a green-and-white logo with a similar sounding Chinese name. [ 26 ]   Also in 2003, Starbucks sent a cease-and-desist letter to ""HaidaBucks Coffee House"" in  Masset, British Columbia ,  Canada . The store was owned by a group of young  Haida  men, commonly referred to as ""bucks."" After facing criticism, Starbucks dropped its demand after HaidaBucks dropped ""coffee house"" from its name. [ 27 ]   In 2005 Starbucks lost a trademark infringement case against a smaller coffee vendor in South Korea that operates coffee stations under the name and style Starpreya. The company, Elpreya, says Starpreya is named after the Norse goddess, Freja, with the letters of that name changed to ease pronunciation by Koreans. The court rejected the Seattle-based retailer's claim that the logo of Starpreya is too similar to the famous Starbucks logo. [ 28 ]   In 2008, Starbucks disputed the copyright application for Seattles  Rat City Rollergirls  logo after the paperwork was filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. [ 29 ]  The corporation claimed the roller derby leagues logo, by  Port Orchard , Washington artist  Krysztof Nemeth , [ 30 ]  was too similar to Starbucks. Starbucks requested an extension to further examine the issue and possibly issue a complaint, which was granted by the Trademark Office. The July 16, 2008 deadline passed without action by the corporation. [ 31 ]     [ edit ]   Environmental record          Starbucks inside  Tsutaya  in  Shibuya ,  Japan       In 1999, Starbucks started ""Grounds for your Garden"" to make their business more environment friendly. ""Grounds for your Garden"" is a year round program that gives leftover coffee grounds to anyone requesting it for composting. Although not all stores and regions participate, customers can request and rally their local Starbucks to begin the practice. In 2004, Starbucks made another contribution to improving the environment by reducing the size of their paper napkins and reducing the size of their store garbage bags. In 2004 alone they reduced over 1.8 million pounds of solid waste. [ 32 ] The U.S.  Food and Drug Administration  granted the first-ever approval to use recycled content in  food packaging  for Starbucks coffee cups. In 2005 the National Recycling Coalition Recycling Works Award went to Starbucks because of their major contributions to the environment. [ 33 ] Coffee and Farmer Equity (C.A.F.E) practices guidelines that are economically beneficial. Starbucks gets all of their coffee beans from farms; this basically ensures that farmers are not negatively affecting the environment while producing coffee beans for Starbucks. [ 34 ]  On a different note, environmentalists argue that Starbucks is not doing all they can to make it the most environment friendly place it can be. ""Dr. Allen Hershkowitz, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, says that Starbucks claimed they were using only 10 percent recycled material partly because the recycled material costs more."" [ 35 ]   In 2008, Starbucks was ranked #15 on the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency 's list of Top 25 Green Power Partners for purchases of renewable energy. [ 36 ]   In October 2008, The UK newspaper  The Sun  reported that Starbucks was wasting 23.4 million litres of water a day by leaving a tap constantly running for rinsing utensils in a ' dipper well ' in each of its stores worldwide. [ 37 ]     [ edit ]   Criticism and controversy          Starbucks at the  Forbidden City  in  Beijing  (closed since July 2007)       Several activist groups maintain websites criticizing the company's  fair-trade  policies, labor relations, and environmental impact, and hold it as a prime example of U.S. cultural and economic  imperialism . Several Starbucks locations were vandalized during the  WTO   meeting held in Seattle in late 1999 .   The Starbucks location in the former imperial palace in Beijing closed in July 2007. The coffee shop had been a source of ongoing controversy since its opening in 2000 with protesters objecting that the presence of the American chain in this location ""was trampling on Chinese culture"". [ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ]     [ edit ]   Anti-competitive tactics   Some of the methods Starbucks has used to expand and maintain their dominant market position include buying out competitors' leases, intentionally operating at a loss, and clustering several locations in a small geographical area (i.e., saturating the market), have been labeled anti-competitive by critics. [ 42 ]  For example, Starbucks fueled its initial expansion into the UK market with a buyout of Seattle Coffee Company, but then used its capital and influence to obtain prime locations, some of which operated at a financial loss. Critics claimed this was an unfair attempt to drive out small, independent competitors, who could not afford to pay inflated prices for premium real estate. [ 43 ]     [ edit ]   Labor disputes   Starbucks workers throughout seven different stores have joined the  Industrial Workers of the World  (IWW) as the  Starbucks Workers Union  since 2004. [ 44 ]          Starbucks in the  Financial District  of  Boston, Massachusetts       According to a Starbucks Union press release, since then, the union membership has begun expanding to Chicago and Maryland in addition to  New York City  where the movement originated. [ 45 ]  On March 7, 2006, the IWW and Starbucks agreed to a  National Labor Relations Board  settlement in which three Starbucks workers were granted almost US$2,000 in back wages and two fired employees were offered reinstatement. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ]  According to the Starbucks Union, on November 24, 2006, IWW members picketed Starbucks locations in more than 50 cities around the world in countries including Australia, Canada, Germany, and the UK, as well as U.S. cities including New York, Chicago, Minneapolis and San Francisco, [ 49 ]  to protest the firing of five Starbucks Workers Union organizers by Starbucks and to demand their reinstatement.   Some Starbucks baristas in Canada, [ 50 ]  Australia and New Zealand, [ 51 ]  and the United States [ 52 ]  belong to a variety of unions. In 2005, Starbucks paid out US$165,000 to eight employees at its Kent, Washington, roasting plant to settle charges that they had been retaliated against for being pro-union. At the time, the plant workers were represented by the  IUOE . Starbucks admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement. [ 44 ]          A Starbucks located in  Lima ,  Peru       A Starbucks strike occurred in  Auckland ,  New Zealand , on November 23, 2005. [ 51 ]  Organized by  Unite Union , workers sought secure hours, a  minimum wage  of NZ$12 an hour, and the abolition of youth rates. The company settled with the Union in 2006, resulting in pay increases, increased security of hours, and an improvement in youth rates. [ 53 ]   According to Starbucks Chairman Howard Schulz, ""If they had faith in me and my motives, they wouldn't need a union."" [ 54 ]  According to  The Seattle Times , ""The International Union of Operating Engineers Local 286 had trouble with Starbucks at its Kent roasting plant, where the union no longer represents workers"". [ 44 ]   In March 2008, Starbucks was ordered to pay  baristas  over  US$ 100 million in back tips in a  Californian   class action lawsuit  launched by baristas alleging that granting shift-supervisors a portion of  tips  violates state  labor laws . The Company plans to appeal. Similarly, an 18 year-old barista in Chestnut Hill, MA has just filed another suit with regards to the tipping policy. Massachusetts law also states that managers may not get a cut of tips.  [ 55 ] [ 56 ]  A similar lawsuit was also filed in Minnesota on March 27, 2008.  [ 57 ]     [ edit ]   Coffee bean market   In 2000, the company introduced a line of  fair trade  products. [ 58 ]   Of the approximately 136,000 tonnes (300 million pounds) of coffee Starbucks purchased in 2006, about 6 percent was certified as fair trade. [ 59 ]   According to Starbucks, they purchased 2,180 tonnes (4.8 million pounds) of Certified Fair Trade coffee in fiscal year 2004 and 5,220 tonnes (11.5 million pounds) in 2005. They have become the largest buyer of Certified Fair Trade coffee in North America (10% of the global market). Transfair USA, [ 60 ]  the only third-party certifier of Fair Trade Certified coffee in the United States, has noted the impact Starbucks has made in the area of Fair Trade and coffee farmer's lives by saying:       Since launching {its} FTC coffee line in 2000, Starbucks has undeniably made a significant contribution to family farmers through their rapidly growing FTC coffee volume. By offering FTC coffee in thousands of stores, Starbucks has also given the FTC label greater visibility, helping to raise consumer awareness in the process.       Groups such as  Global Exchange  are calling for Starbucks to further increase its sales of fair trade coffees. Fair trade certification can cost US$2,500 to US$10,000, based on the size of the producer group and length of time the inspections take, and many growers are unwilling or unable to pay for certification. [ 61 ]   Beyond Fair Trade Certification, Starbucks argues that it pays above market prices for all of its coffee. According to the company, in 2004 it paid on average $1.42 per pound ($2.64kg) for high-quality coffee beans. [ 62 ]  This is in comparison to commodity prices which were as low as $0.50$0.60 in 20032004. [ 63 ]     [ edit ]   Ethos water controversy          A Starbucks located in  Trujillo ,  Per       Ethos , a brand of bottled water acquired by Starbucks in 2005, is sold at locations throughout North America. Ethos bottles feature prominent labeling stating ""helping children get clean water"", referring to the fact that $.05 from each $1.80 bottle sold ($.10 per unit in Canada) is used to fund clean water projects in under-developed areas. Although sales of Ethos water have raised over $4,000,000 for clean water efforts, the brand is not a charity. Critics have argued that the claim on the label misleads consumers into thinking that Ethos is primarily a charitable organization, when it is actually a for-profit Starbucks brand and the vast majority of the sale price (over 94%) does not support clean-water projects. [ 64 ]   [ 65 ]  The founders of Ethos have stated that the brand is intended to raise awareness of third-world clean water issues and provide socially responsible consumers with an opportunity to support the cause by choosing Ethos over other brands. [ 66 ]  Starbucks has since redesigned the American version of the Ethos water bottles, stating the amount of money donated per bottle in the description.     [ edit ]   Brighton store opens in breach of planning regulations   In May 2008, a branch of Starbucks was completed in  Kemptown  on St. James's Street,  Brighton, England , despite having being refused permission by the local planning authority, Brighton and Hove City Council. They claimed there were too many coffee shops already present on the street. [ 67 ] [ 68 ]  Starbucks has appealed the decision, with Brighton and Hove council monitoring the situation. [ 69 ]   Brighton & Hove City Council have served Starbucks with an enforcement notice (which they have appealed) to remove all tables and chairs from the premises in order to comply with planning regulations and operate as an A1 retail shop, rather than an A3 coffee shop/restaurant, for which they have no planning permission. The deadline of the enforcement is 20 February 2009. [ 70 ]     [ edit ]   Rumors about the Israeli military   There are rumors that Starbucks sends part of its profits to the  Israeli military . [ 71 ]  In response to these rumors, Starbucks issued a statement saying Neither Chairman Howard Schultz nor Starbucks fund or support the Israeli Army. Starbucks is a non-political organization and does not support individual political causes. [ 72 ] [ 73 ] .   During the  20082009 IsraelGaza conflict , Starbucks became a target of protests by pro-Palestinian activists. Starbucks was forced to close a store in  Beirut ,  Lebanon  because of demonstrators shouting anti-Israel slogans and causing customers to flee. Protesters in Beirut told the  Associated Press  that they targeted Starbucks because they claim Chairman and CEO Howard Schultz donates money to the Israeli military. They hung several banners on the shop's window and used white tape to paste a  Star of David  over the green-and-white Starbucks sign. They also distributed a letter saying Schultz ""is one of the pillars of the American  Jewish lobby  and the owner of the Starbucks,"" which they said donates money to the Israeli military. Starbucks responded by saying ""Rumors that Starbucks Coffee Company and its management support Israel are unequivocally false. ... Starbucks is a nonpolitical organization and does not support political causes. Further, political preferences of a Starbucks partner [employee] at any level have absolutely no bearing on Starbucks company policies."" [ 74 ]     [ edit ]   Violence against Starbucks in the United Kingdom   On January 12, 2009, a Starbucks in Whitechapel Road in  London  was the target of vandalism by pro- Palestinian  demonstrators broke windows and reportedly ripped out fittings and equipment after clashes with riot police. Later the same day, after midnight, a suspected makeshift firebomb was hurled into the premises, causing further damage. [ 74 ] [ 75 ] [ 76 ]   On January 17, 2009, at an anti-Israel protest held by the  Stop the War Coalition  in  Trafalgar Square  in central  London , British Rapper  Lowkey  stated, with regard to Starbucks, that: ""You say you know about the Zionist lobby but you put money in their pockets every time youre buying their coffee."" After the rally, two groups of people, many wearing scarves over their faces, smashed and looted two Starbucks on Piccadilly and Shaftesbury Avenue. Although the Starbucks stores had requested greater police protection following the violence against a Starbucks the previous week,  Scotland Yard  stated it could ""not stop thugs hell-bent on causing damage."" [ 77 ] [ 75 ] [ 78 ] [ 79 ]     [ edit ]   Accusations by Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi   In a sermon delivered by Muslim cleric Sheikh  Yusuf al-Qaradawi , which aired on  Al Jazeera TV  on January 9, 2009 (as translated by MEMRI), Al-Qaradhawi accused Starbucks of supporting Israeli education and the Isreali Army and called for a boycott of the company and other western chains [ 80 ] . Al-Qaradawi has previously called for a similar boycott of all US products with limited success [ 81 ] . Starbucks has not commented directly on Al-Qaradawi's accusations, but has in the past, denied supporting Israel or any other political action  [ 74 ] .     [ edit ]   Other ventures       Main article:  Hear Music       Starbucks entered the music industry in 1999 with the acquisition of Hear Music, and the film industry in 2006 with the creation of Starbucks Entertainment. Starbucks Entertainment was one of the producers of the 2006 film  Akeelah and the Bee . Retail stores heavily advertised the film before its release.   Hear Music is the brand name of Starbucks' retail music concept. Hear Music began as a catalog company in 1990 and was purchased by Starbucks in 1999. Nearly three years later, in 2002, they produced a Starbucks opera album, featuring artists such as  Luciano Pavarotti .     [ edit ]   Partnership with Apple   Starbucks has agreed to a partnership with  Apple  to collaborate on selling music as part of the coffeehouse experience. In October 2006, Apple added a Starbucks Entertainment area to the  iTunes Store , selling similar music that appeared in Starbucks stores. In September 2007 Apple announced that there would be wireless communication between Apple and Starbucks. Through the AT&T Wi-Fi, a paywall is opened up to allow any individual connecting to AT&T wifi access to the  iTunes Store  (regardless of whether he or she is an AT&T subscriber). The partnership is primarily targeted at  iPhone ,  iPod Touch , and  Macbook  users (although anyone with access to iTunes can take advantage of it). In addition, the iTunes Store will automatically detect the current and last 10 songs playing in a Starbucks and offer users connected to the store's wireless network the opportunity to download the tracks. This feature has been rolled out in  Seattle ,  New York City , and the  San Francisco Bay Area , and will slowly be offered in limited markets during 20072008. [ 82 ]  During the fall of 2007, Starbucks also began to sell digital downloads of certain albums through iTunes. The buyer would buy the download at Starbucks, and enter the code on the download card at the iTunes Store, and then the entire album would immediately start downloading. From October 2 to November 7, 2007, Starbucks gave away 37 different songs for free download through iTunes as part of the ""Song of the Day"" promotion. Each day, baristas would give out download cards for a particular song which could be redeemed on iTunes. Currently, every Tuesday, a new ""Pick of the Week"" download card is available at Starbucks for a free song download, similar to its previous ""Song of the Day.""

Starbucks is the largest  coffeehouse  company in the world, [ 2 ]  with 16,120 stores in 44 countries. [ 3 ]  Starbucks sells  drip brewed coffee ,  espresso -based hot drinks, other hot and cold drinks, snacks, and items such as mugs and coffee beans. Through the Starbucks Entertainment division and  Hear Music  brand, the company also markets books, music, and film. Many of the company's products are seasonal or specific to the locality of the store. Starbucks-brand ice cream and coffee are also sold at grocery stores.   From Starbucks' founding in Seattle as a local  coffee bean  roaster and retailer, the company has expanded rapidly. In the 1990s, Starbucks was opening a new store every workday, a pace that continued into the 2000s. Domestic growth has since slowed, although the company continues to expand in foreign markets and will open a net of 900 new stores outside of the U.S. in 2009. [ 4 ]  The first location outside of the United States and Canada was established in 1990s, and they now constitute almost one third of Starbucks' stores. [ 5 ]   As of early 2009, Starbucks has more than 16,000 stores in 58 countries worldwide, 11,006 of which are located in the United States, followed by Canada with 976 and Japan with 845 locations. On July 1, 2008, the company announced it was closing 600 under-performing company-owned stores and cutting U.S. expansion plans amid growing economic uncertainty. [ 6 ] [ 7 ]  On July 29, 2008, Starbucks also cut almost 1,000 non-retail jobs as part of its bid to re-energize the brand and boost its profit. Of the new cuts, 550 of the positions are layoffs and the rest are unfilled jobs. [ 8 ]  These closings and layoffs have effectively ended the companys period of growth and expansion that began in the mid-1990s.   On January 28, 2009, Starbucks announced the closure of an additional 300 under-performing stores, and the elimination of 7,000 positions. CEO Howard Schultz also announced that he had received board approval to reduce his salary.

Located in the old Sears, Roebuck and Co. catalog distribution center building.       The original Starbucks was opened in Pike Place Market in Seattle, Washington, in 1971 by three partners: English teacher  Jerry Baldwin , history teacher  Zev Siegel , and writer  Gordon Bowker . The three were inspired by  Alfred Peet , whom they knew personally, to open their first store in  Pike Place Market  to sell high-quality coffee beans and equipment. The original Starbucks location was at 2000 Western Avenue from 19711976. That store then moved to 1912 Pike Place; it is still open. During their first year of operation, they purchased green  coffee beans  from  Peet's , then began buying directly from growers.   Entrepreneur  Howard Schultz  joined the company in 1982, and, after a trip to  Milan, Italy , advised that the company should sell coffee and  espresso  drinks as well as beans. The owners rejected this idea, believing that getting into the beverage business would distract the company from its primary focus. To them,  coffee  was something to be prepared in the home. Certain that there was much money to be made selling drinks to on-the-go Americans, Schultz started the  Il Giornale  coffee bar chain in 1985.   In 1984, the original owners of Starbucks, led by Baldwin, took the opportunity to purchase Peet's (Baldwin still works there today). In 1987, they sold the Starbucks chain to Schultz's Il Giornale, which rebranded the Il Giornale outlets as Starbucks and quickly began to expand. Starbucks opened its first locations outside Seattle at  Waterfront Station  in  Vancouver ,  British Columbia , and  Chicago ,  Illinois , that same year. At the time of its  initial public offering  on the stock market in 1992, Starbucks had grown to 165 outlets.    The first Starbucks location outside of North America opened in  Tokyo  in 1996. Starbucks entered the  U.K.  market in 1998 with the acquisition of the then 60-outlet, UK-based Seattle Coffee Company, re-branding all its stores as Starbucks. By November 2005,  London  had more outlets than  Manhattan , [ 10 ]  a sign of Starbucks becoming an international brand.          A Starbucks coffee shop in  Leeds ,  United Kingdom       In 1999, Starbucks experimented with eateries in the San Francisco Bay area through a restaurant chain called Circadia. [ 11 ]  These restaurants were soon ""outed"" as Starbucks establishments and converted to Starbucks cafes.   In April 2003, Starbucks completed the purchase of  Seattle's Best Coffee  and  Torrefazione Italia  from  AFC Enterprises , bringing the total number of Starbucks-operated locations worldwide to more than 6,400. On September 14, 2006, rival  Diedrich Coffee  announced that it would sell most of its company-owned retail stores to Starbucks. This sale includes the company-owned locations of the Oregon-based  Coffee People  chain. Starbucks has converted the Diedrich Coffee and Coffee People locations to Starbucks as of summer 2007, although the Portland airport Coffee People locations were excluded from the sale. [ 12 ] [ 13 ]   Starbucks' chairman,  Howard Schultz , has talked about making sure growth does not dilute the company's culture  [ 14 ]  and the common goal of the company's leadership to act like a small company.          The first Starbucks branch.       In January 2008, Chairman  Howard Schultz  resumed his roles as President and Chief Executive Officer after an eight year hiatus, and replaced Jim Donald, who took those posts in 2005 but decided to leave the company in late 2007. Schultz's principal challenge is to restore what he calls the ""distinctive Starbucks experience"" in the face of rapid expansion. Analysts believe that Schultz must determine how to contend with higher materials prices and enhanced competition from lower-price fast food chains, including  McDonald's  and  Dunkin' Donuts . On January 31, 2008, Schultz announced that Starbucks would discontinue its warm breakfast sandwich products, originally scheduled to launch nationwide in 2008, in order to refocus the brand on all things coffee. On February 23, Starbucks closed its stores from 5:30 p.m. to 9 p.m. local time to train its baristas. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]   As Starbucks often tests new products as part of its ongoing innovation and transformation, Starbucks started testing selling an 8 oz ""short"" brewed coffee for $1 and giving free refills on all brewed coffee. This test was limited to the greater Seattle market, with no plans for expansion to national markets. Per an internal email this program was cancelled in late March 2008.          A typical sales area, this one in  Peterborough ,  UK , showing a display of food and the beverage preparation area       In March 2008, Schultz made several announcements to Starbucks  shareholders . Shultz introduced Starbucks' ""state of the art espresso system"", [ 17 ]  the  Thermoplan AG  manufactured Mastrena, which replaced their previous superauto, the Thermoplan Verismo 801(known internationally as the Thermoplan Black & White). Starbucks also announced that the company hopes to enter the energy drink market and introduce a customer reward program. Pre-ground beans will also no longer be used, in order that the additional grinding of all whole bean coffee will ""bring aroma, romance and theater"" to American stores. [ 18 ]  The company also announced the recent acquisition of The Coffee Equipment Company, [ 17 ]  the manufacturer of the Clover Brewing System. They are currently test marketing this unique ""fresh-pressed"" coffee system at six Starbucks locations, three in Seattle, and three in Boston. [ 19 ]   In May 2008, a rewards program was initiated for registered users of the Starbucks Card. Previously simply a gift card, the Starbucks Card has undergone a transition into a rewards card, similar to cards offered by other retail outlets. Perks and rewards offered to registered users are 2 hours of free Wi-Fi Internet service per day, free refills of brewed coffee (some locations only honour this for the first 3 hours of your stay), a free tall beverage with the purchase of 1 lb. of whole bean coffee, as well as free milk (e.g. soy) and syrup drink modifiers. [ 20 ]  This is a new and aggressive approach by Starbucks to create and strengthen customer loyalty.   Tags displaying the title ""Master"" are worn by employees who have completed the Coffee Master course, which educates employees in not only the tasting, but also growing regions, roasting, and purchasing (including  fair trade  practices) aspects of the coffee industry. Almost 70% of the coffee used by Starbucks around the world comes from the sixth major producer in the world,  Guatemala , a pro-organic producer.   Starting in November of 2008 Starbucks began selling Product Red goods. According to the website because of this they have been able to provide AIDS medicine for 3,800 for an entire year. [ 21 ]     [ edit ]   Intellectual property   Starbucks U.S. Brands, LLC, is a Starbucks-owned company that currently holds and owns the property rights to approximately 120 Starbucks Coffee Company patents and trademarks. It is located at 2525 Starbucks Way in  Minden, Nevada . [ 22 ]     [ edit ]   Name   The company is named in part after  Starbuck ,  Captain Ahab 's  first mate  in the book  Moby-Dick , as well as a turn-of-the-century mining camp ( Starbo  or  Storbo ) on  Mount Rainier . According to  Howard Schultz 's book  Pour Your Heart Into It: How Starbucks Built a Company One Cup at a Time , the name of the company was derived from  Moby-Dick , although not in as direct a fashion as many assume. Gordon Bowker liked the name ""Pequod"" (the ship in the novel), but his then creative partner Terry Heckler responded, ""No one's going to drink a cup of Pee-quod!"" Heckler suggested ""Starbo"". Brainstorming with these two ideas resulted in the company being named for the  Pequod' s first mate, Starbuck.

[ 25 ]  The logo has been significantly streamlined over the years. In the first version, which gave the impression of an authentic 15th century European  woodcut , the Starbucks siren was topless and had a fully visible double fish tail. The image also had a rough visual texture. In the second version, which was used from 1987-92, her breasts were covered by her flowing hair, but her  navel  was still visible, and the fish tail was cropped slightly. In the current version, used since 1992, her navel and breasts are not visible at all, and only vestiges remain of the fish tails. The original ""woodcut"" logo can still be seen on the Starbucks store in Seattle's Pike Place Market, and on both the House Blend and Decaf House Blend packaging.   At the beginning of September 2006 and then again in early 2008, Starbucks temporarily reintroduced its original brown logo on paper hot drink cups. Starbucks has stated that this was done to show the company's heritage from the Pacific Northwest and to celebrate 35 years of business. The vintage logo sparked some controversy due in part to the siren's bare breasts, [ 26 ]  but the temporary switch garnered little attention from the media. Starbucks had drawn similar criticism when they reintroduced the vintage logo in 2006. [ 27 ]     [ edit ]   Parodies and infringements     [ edit ]   Environmental record          Starbucks inside  Tsutaya  in  Shibuya ,  Japan       In 1999, Starbucks started ""Grounds for your Garden"" to make their business more environment friendly. ""Grounds for your Garden"" is a year round program that gives leftover coffee grounds to anyone requesting it for composting. Although not all stores and regions participate, customers can request and rally their local Starbucks to begin the practice. In 2004, Starbucks began reducing the size of their paper napkins and store garbage bags, and lightening their solid waste production by 1.8 million pounds. [ 28 ] The U.S.  Food and Drug Administration  granted the first-ever approval to use recycled content in  food packaging  for Starbucks coffee cups. In 2005 Starbucks received the National Recycling Coalition Recycling Works Award. [ 29 ]  In 2008, Starbucks was ranked #15 on the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency 's list of Top 25 Green Power Partners for purchases of renewable energy. [ 30 ]   Starbucks has also received criticism from environmentalists. ""Dr. Allen Hershkowitz, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, says that Starbucks claimed they were using only 10 percent recycled material partly because the recycled material costs more."" [ 31 ]  In October 2008, The UK newspaper  The Sun  reported that Starbucks was wasting 23.4 million litres of water a day by leaving a tap constantly running for rinsing utensils in a ' dipper well ' in each of its stores worldwide. [ 32 ]   Does anyone know other environmental impact stats for Starbucks annually-- Asiachai  ( talk ) 17:30, 16 March 2009 (UTC)     [ edit ]   Criticism and controversy          Starbucks at the  Forbidden City  in  Beijing  (closed since July 2007)       Several activist groups maintain websites criticizing the company's  fair-trade  policies, labor relations, and environmental impact, and hold it as a prime example of U.S. cultural and economic  imperialism . Several Starbucks locations were vandalized during the  WTO   meeting held in Seattle in late 1999 .   The Starbucks location in the former imperial palace in Beijing closed in July 2007. The coffee shop had been a source of ongoing controversy since its opening in 2000 with protesters objecting that the presence of the American chain in this location ""was trampling on Chinese culture"". [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ]     [ edit ]   Anti-competitive tactics   Some of the methods Starbucks has used to expand and maintain their dominant market position include buying out competitors' leases, intentionally operating at a loss, and clustering several locations in a small geographical area (i.e., saturating the market), have been labeled anti-competitive by critics. [ 37 ]  For example, Starbucks fueled its initial expansion into the UK market with a buyout of Seattle Coffee Company, but then used its capital and influence to obtain prime locations, some of which operated at a financial loss. Critics claimed this was an unfair attempt to drive out small, independent competitors, who could not afford to pay inflated prices for premium real estate. [ 38 ]     [ edit ]   Labor disputes   Starbucks workers throughout seven different stores have joined the  Industrial Workers of the World  (IWW) as the  Starbucks Workers Union  since 2004. [ 39 ]          Starbucks in the  Financial District  of  Boston, Massachusetts       According to a Starbucks Union press release, since then, the union membership has begun expanding to Chicago and Maryland in addition to  New York City  where the movement originated. [ 40 ]  On March 7, 2006, the IWW and Starbucks agreed to a  National Labor Relations Board  settlement in which three Starbucks workers were granted almost US$2,000 in back wages and two fired employees were offered reinstatement. [ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ]  According to the Starbucks Union, on November 24, 2006, IWW members picketed Starbucks locations in more than 50 cities around the world in countries including Australia, Canada, Germany, and the UK, as well as U.S. cities including New York, Chicago, Minneapolis and San Francisco, [ 44 ]  to protest the firing of five Starbucks Workers Union organizers by Starbucks and to demand their reinstatement.   Some Starbucks baristas in Canada, [ 45 ]  Australia and New Zealand, [ 46 ]  and the United States [ 47 ]  belong to a variety of unions. In 2005, Starbucks paid out US$165,000 to eight employees at its Kent, Washington, roasting plant to settle charges that they had been retaliated against for being pro-union. At the time, the plant workers were represented by the  IUOE . Starbucks admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement. [ 39 ]          A Starbucks located in  Lima ,  Peru       A Starbucks strike occurred in  Auckland ,  New Zealand , on November 23, 2005. [ 46 ]  Organized by  Unite Union , workers sought secure hours, a  minimum wage  of NZ$12 an hour, and the abolition of youth rates. The company settled with the Union in 2006, resulting in pay increases, increased security of hours, and an improvement in youth rates. [ 48 ]   According to Starbucks Chairman Howard Schulz, ""If they had faith in me and my motives, they wouldn't need a union."" [ 49 ]  According to  The Seattle Times , ""The International Union of Operating Engineers Local 286 had trouble with Starbucks at its Kent roasting plant, where the union no longer represents workers"". [ 39 ]   In March 2008, Starbucks was ordered to pay  baristas  over  US$ 100 million in back tips in a  Californian   class action lawsuit  launched by baristas alleging that granting shift-supervisors a portion of  tips  violates state  labor laws . The Company plans to appeal. Similarly, an 18 year-old barista in Chestnut Hill, MA has just filed another suit with regards to the tipping policy. Massachusetts law also states that managers may not get a cut of tips.  [ 50 ] [ 51 ]  A similar lawsuit was also filed in Minnesota on March 27, 2008.  [ 52 ]     [ edit ]   Coffee bean market   In 2000, the company introduced a line of  fair trade  products. [ 53 ]   Of the approximately 136,000 tonnes (300 million pounds) of coffee Starbucks purchased in 2006, about 6 percent was certified as fair trade. [ 54 ]   According to Starbucks, they purchased 2,180 tonnes (4.8 million pounds) of Certified Fair Trade coffee in fiscal year 2004 and 5,220 tonnes (11.5 million pounds) in 2005. They have become the largest buyer of Certified Fair Trade coffee in North America (10% of the global market). Transfair USA, [ 55 ]  the only third-party certifier of Fair Trade Certified coffee in the United States, has noted the impact Starbucks has made in the area of Fair Trade and coffee farmer's lives by saying:       Since launching {its} FTC coffee line in 2000, Starbucks has undeniably made a significant contribution to family farmers through their rapidly growing FTC coffee volume. By offering FTC coffee in thousands of stores, Starbucks has also given the FTC label greater visibility, helping to raise consumer awareness in the process.       Groups such as  Global Exchange  are calling for Starbucks to further increase its sales of fair trade coffees. Fair trade certification can cost US$2,500 to US$10,000, based on the size of the producer group and length of time the inspections take, and many growers are unwilling or unable to pay for certification. [ 56 ]   Beyond Fair Trade Certification, Starbucks argues that it pays above market prices for all of its coffee. According to the company, in 2004 it paid on average $1.42 per pound ($2.64kg) for high-quality coffee beans. [ 57 ]  This is in comparison to commodity prices which were as low as $0.50$0.60 in 20032004. [ 58 ]     [ edit ]   Ethos water controversy          A Starbucks located in  Trujillo ,  Per       Ethos , a brand of bottled water acquired by Starbucks in 2005, is sold at locations throughout North America. Ethos bottles feature prominent labeling stating ""helping children get clean water"", referring to the fact that $.05 from each $1.80 bottle sold ($.10 per unit in Canada) is used to fund clean water projects in under-developed areas. Although sales of Ethos water have raised over $6,200,000 for clean water efforts, the brand is not a charity. Critics have argued that the claim on the label misleads consumers into thinking that Ethos is primarily a charitable organization, when it is actually a for-profit Starbucks brand and the vast majority of the sale price (97.2%) does not support clean-water projects. [ 59 ] [ 60 ]  The founders of Ethos have stated that the brand is intended to raise awareness of third-world clean water issues and provide socially responsible consumers with an opportunity to support the cause by choosing Ethos over other brands. [ 61 ]  Starbucks has since redesigned the American version of the Ethos water bottles, stating the amount of money donated per bottle in the description.     [ edit ]   Brighton store opens in breach of planning regulations   In May 2008, a branch of Starbucks was completed in  Kemptown  on St. James's Street,  Brighton, England , despite having being refused permission by the local planning authority, Brighton and Hove City Council. They claimed there were too many coffee shops already present on the street. [ 62 ] [ 63 ]  Starbucks has appealed the decision, with Brighton and Hove council monitoring the situation. [ 64 ]   Brighton & Hove City Council have served Starbucks with an enforcement notice (which they have appealed) to remove all tables and chairs from the premises in order to comply with planning regulations and operate as an A1 retail shop, rather than an A3 coffee shop/restaurant, for which they have no planning permission. The deadline of the enforcement is 20 February 2009. [ 65 ]     [ edit ]   Alleged relationship with the Israeli military   There have been calls for boycott of Starbucks stores and products because it is alleged that Starbucks sends part of its profits to the  Israeli military . [ 66 ]  It has been long alleged that Schultz is ""an active  Zionist ""  [ 67 ]  and is a recipient of several Israeli awards including ""The Israel 50th Anniversary Tribute Award"" for ""playing a key role in promoting a close alliance between the United States and Israel."" [ 68 ]  In response to these allegations Starbucks issued a statement saying Neither Chairman Howard Schultz nor Starbucks fund or support the Israeli Army. Starbucks is a non-political organization and does not support individual political causes. [ 69 ]  Starbucks has been a regular target of activists protesting against the  Israeli intervention in Gaza . Starbucks was forced to close a store in  Beirut ,  Lebanon  because of demonstrators shouting anti-Israel slogans and causing customers to flee. [ 70 ]  Protesters in Beirut told the  Associated Press  that they targeted Starbucks because they claim Chairman and CEO Howard Schultz donates money to the Israeli military. They hung several banners on the shop's window and used white tape to paste a  Star of David  over the green-and-white Starbucks sign. They also distributed a letter saying Schultz ""is one of the pillars of the American  Jewish lobby  and the owner of the Starbucks,"" which they said donates money to the Israeli military. [ 71 ]  Starbucks responded by saying ""Rumors that Starbucks Coffee Company and its management support Israel are unequivocally false. ... Starbucks is a nonpolitical organization and does not support political causes. Further, political preferences of a Starbucks partner [employee] at any level have absolutely no bearing on Starbucks company policies."" [ 72 ]     [ edit ]   Violence against Starbucks in the United Kingdom   On January 12, 2009, a Starbucks in Whitechapel Road in  London  was the target of vandalism by pro- Palestinian  demonstrators broke windows and reportedly ripped out fittings and equipment after clashes with riot police. Later the same day, after midnight, a suspected makeshift firebomb was hurled into the premises, causing further damage. [ 73 ] [ 74 ] [ 75 ]   On January 17, 2009, at an anti-Israel protest held by the  Stop the War Coalition  in  Trafalgar Square  in central  London , British Rapper  Lowkey  stated, with regard to Starbucks, that: ""You say you know about the Zionist lobby but you put money in their pockets every time youre buying their coffee."" After the rally, two groups of people, many wearing scarves over their faces, smashed and looted two Starbucks on Piccadilly and Shaftesbury Avenue. Although the Starbucks stores had requested greater police protection following the violence against a Starbucks the previous week,  Scotland Yard  stated it could ""not stop thugs hell-bent on causing damage."" [ 76 ] [ 74 ] [ 77 ] [ 78 ]     [ edit ]   Accusations by Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi   In a sermon delivered by Muslim cleric Sheikh  Yusuf al-Qaradawi , which aired on  Al Jazeera TV  on January 9, 2009 (as translated by MEMRI), Al-Qaradhawi accused Starbucks of supporting Israeli education and the Israeli Army and called for a boycott of the company and other western chains. [ 79 ]  Al-Qaradawi has previously called for a similar boycott of all US products with limited success. [ 80 ]  Starbucks has not commented directly on Al-Qaradawi's accusations, but has in the past, denied supporting Israel or any other political action. [ 73 ]     [ edit ]   Other ventures   Main article:  Hear Music   Starbucks entered the music industry in 1999 with the acquisition of Hear Music, and the film industry in 2006 with the creation of Starbucks Entertainment. Starbucks Entertainment was one of the producers of the 2006 film  Akeelah and the Bee . Retail stores heavily advertised the film before its release.   Hear Music is the brand name of Starbucks' retail music concept. Hear Music began as a catalog company in 1990 and was purchased by Starbucks in 1999. Nearly three years later, in 2002, they produced a Starbucks opera album, featuring artists such as  Luciano Pavarotti .     [ edit ]   Partnership with Apple   Starbucks has agreed to a partnership with  Apple  to collaborate on selling music as part of the coffeehouse experience. In October 2006, Apple added a Starbucks Entertainment area to the  iTunes Store , selling similar music that appeared in Starbucks stores. In September 2007 Apple announced that there would be wireless communication between Apple and Starbucks. Through the AT&T Wi-Fi, a paywall is opened up to allow any individual connecting to AT&T wifi access to the  iTunes Store  (regardless of whether he or she is an AT&T subscriber). The partnership is primarily targeted at  iPhone ,  iPod Touch , and  Macbook  users (although anyone with access to iTunes can take advantage of it). In addition, the iTunes Store will automatically detect the current and last 10 songs playing in a Starbucks and offer users connected to the store's wireless network the opportunity to download the tracks. This feature has been rolled out in  Seattle ,  New York City , and the  San Francisco Bay Area , and will slowly be offered in limited markets during 20072008. [ 81 ]  During the fall of 2007, Starbucks also began to sell digital downloads of certain albums through iTunes. The buyer would buy the download at Starbucks, and enter the code on the download card at the iTunes Store, and then the entire album would immediately start downloading. From October 2 to November 7, 2007, Starbucks gave away 37 different songs for free download through iTunes as part of the ""Song of the Day"" promotion. Each day, baristas would give out download cards for a particular song which could be redeemed on iTunes. Currently, every Tuesday, a new ""Pick of the Week"" download card is available at Starbucks for a free song download, similar to its previous ""Song of the Day.""

Starbucks is the largest  coffeehouse  company in the world, [ 2 ]  with 16,120 stores in 44 countries. [ 3 ]  Starbucks sells  drip brewed coffee ,  espresso -based hot drinks, other hot and cold drinks, snacks, and items such as mugs and coffee beans. Through the Starbucks Entertainment division and  Hear Music  brand, the company also markets books, music, and film. Many of the company's products are seasonal or specific to the locality of the store. Starbucks-brand ice cream and coffee are also sold at grocery stores.   From Starbucks' founding in Seattle as a local  coffee bean  roaster and retailer, the company has expanded rapidly. In the 1990s, Starbucks was opening a new store every workday, a pace that continued into the 2000s. Domestic growth has since slowed, although the company continues to expand in foreign markets and will open a net of 900 new stores outside of the U.S. in 2009. [ 4 ]  The first location outside of the United States and Canada was established in 1990s, and they now constitute almost one third of Starbucks' stores. [ 5 ]   By late March 2008, Starbucks had more than 16,226 stores worldwide, including 11,434 stores located in the United States. On July 1, 2008, the company announced it was closing 600 under-performing company-owned stores and cutting U.S. expansion plans amid growing economic uncertainty. [ 6 ] [ 7 ]  On July 29, 2008, Starbucks also cut almost 1,000 non-retail jobs as part of its bid to re-energize the brand and boost its profit. Of the new cuts, 550 of the positions are layoffs and the rest are unfilled jobs. [ 8 ]  These closings and layoffs have effectively ended the companys period of growth and expansion that began in the mid-1990s.   On January 28, 2009, Starbucks announced the closure of an additional 300 under-performing stores, and the elimination of 7,000 positions. CEO Howard Schultz also announced that he had received board approval to reduce his salary to $10,000 per year.

Located in the old Sears, Roebuck and Co. catalog distribution center building.       The original Starbucks was opened in Pike Place Market in Seattle, Washington, in 1971 by three partners: English teacher  Jerry Baldwin , history teacher  Zev Siegel , and writer  Gordon Bowker . The three were inspired by  Alfred Peet , whom they knew personally, to open their first store in  Pike Place Market  to sell high-quality coffee beans and equipment. The original Starbucks location was at 2000 Western Avenue from 19711976. That store then moved to 1912 Pike Place; it is still open. During their first year of operation, they purchased green  coffee beans  from  Peet's , then began buying directly from growers.   Entrepreneur  Howard Schultz  joined the company in 1983, and, after a trip to  Milan, Italy , advised that the company should sell coffee and  espresso  drinks as well as beans. The owners rejected this idea, believing that getting into the beverage business would distract the company from its primary focus. To them,  coffee  was something to be prepared in the home. Certain that there was much money to be made selling drinks to on-the-go Americans, Schultz started the  Il Giornale  coffee bar chain in 1985.   In 1984, the original owners of Starbucks, led by Baldwin, took the opportunity to purchase Peet's (Baldwin still works there today). In 1987, they sold the Starbucks chain to Schultz's Il Giornale, which rebranded the Il Giornale outlets as Starbucks and quickly began to expand. Starbucks opened its first locations outside Seattle at  Waterfront Station  in  Vancouver ,  British Columbia , and  Chicago ,  Illinois , that same year. At the time of its  initial public offering  on the stock market in 1992, Starbucks had grown to 165 outlets.    The first Starbucks location outside of North America opened in  Tokyo  in 1996. Starbucks entered the  U.K.  market in 1998 with the acquisition of the then 60-outlet, UK-based Seattle Coffee Company, re-branding all its stores as Starbucks. By November 2005,  London  had more outlets than  Manhattan , [ 10 ]  a sign of Starbucks becoming an international brand.          A Starbucks coffee shop in  Leeds ,  United Kingdom       In 1999, Starbucks experimented with eateries in the San Francisco Bay area through a restaurant chain called Circadia. [ 11 ]  These restaurants were soon ""outed"" as Starbucks establishments and converted to Starbucks cafes.   In April 2003, Starbucks completed the purchase of  Seattle's Best Coffee  and  Torrefazione Italia  from  AFC Enterprises , bringing the total number of Starbucks-operated locations worldwide to more than 6,400. On September 14, 2006, rival  Diedrich Coffee  announced that it would sell most of its company-owned retail stores to Starbucks. This sale includes the company-owned locations of the Oregon-based  Coffee People  chain. Starbucks has converted the Diedrich Coffee and Coffee People locations to Starbucks as of summer 2007, although the Portland airport Coffee People locations were excluded from the sale.  [ 12 ] [ 13 ]   Starbucks' chairman,  Howard Schultz , has talked about making sure growth does not dilute the company's culture  [ 14 ]  and the common goal of the company's leadership to act like a small company.          The first Starbucks branch.       In January 2008, Chairman  Howard Schultz  resumed his roles as President and Chief Executive Officer after an eight year hiatus, and replaced Jim Donald, who took those posts in 2005 but decided to leave the company in late 2007. Schultz's principal challenge is to restore what he calls the ""distinctive Starbucks experience"" in the face of rapid expansion. Analysts believe that Schultz must determine how to contend with higher materials prices and enhanced competition from lower-price fast food chains, including  McDonald's  and  Dunkin' Donuts . On January 31, 2008, Schultz announced that Starbucks would discontinue its warm breakfast sandwich products, originally scheduled to launch nationwide in 2008, in order to refocus the brand on all things coffee.   As Starbucks often tests new products as part of its ongoing innovation and transformation, Starbucks started testing selling an 8 oz ""short"" brewed coffee for $1 and giving free refills on all brewed coffee. This test was limited to the greater Seattle market, with no plans for expansion to national markets. Per an internal email this program was cancelled in late March 2008.          A typical sales area, this one in  Peterborough ,  UK , showing a display of food and the beverage preparation area       In March 2008, Schultz made several announcements to Starbucks  shareholders . Shultz introduced Starbucks' ""state of the art espresso system"", [ 15 ]  the  Thermoplan AG  manufactured Mastrena, which replaced their previous superauto, the Thermoplan Verismo 801(known internationally as the Thermoplan Black & White). Starbucks also announced that the company hopes to enter the energy drink market and introduce a customer reward program. Pre-ground beans will also no longer be used, in order that the additional grinding of all whole bean coffee will ""bring aroma, romance and theater"" to American stores.  [ 16 ]  The company also announced the recent acquisition of The Coffee Equipment Company, [ 15 ]  the manufacturer of the Clover Brewing System. They are currently test marketing this unique ""fresh-pressed"" coffee system at six Starbucks locations, three in Seattle, and three in Boston. [ 17 ]   In May 2008, a rewards program was initiated for registered users of the Starbucks Card. Previously simply a gift card, the Starbucks Card has undergone a transition into a rewards card, similar to cards offered by other retail outlets. Perks and rewards offered to registered users are 2 hours of free Wi-Fi Internet service per day, free refills of brewed coffee, a free tall beverage with the purchase of 1 lb. of whole bean coffee, as well as free milk (e.g. soy) and syrup drink modifiers.  [ 18 ]  This is a new and aggressive approach by Starbucks to create and strengthen customer loyalty.   Tags displaying the title ""Master"" are worn by employees who have completed the Coffee Master course, which educates employees in not only the tasting, but also growing regions, roasting, and purchasing (including  fair trade  practices) aspects of the coffee industry. Almost the 70% of the coffee used by Starbucks around the world came from the sixth major producer in the world,  Guatemala , a pro-organic producer.     [ edit ]   Intellectual property   Starbucks U.S. Brands, LLC, is a Starbucks-owned company that currently holds and owns the property rights to approximately 120 Starbucks Coffee Company patents and trademarks. It is located at 2525 Starbucks Way in  Minden, Nevada . [ 19 ]     [ edit ]   Name   The company is named in part after  Starbuck ,  Captain Ahab 's  first mate  in the book  Moby-Dick , as well as a turn-of-the-century mining camp ( Starbo  or  Storbo ) on  Mount Rainier . According to  Howard Schultz 's book  Pour Your Heart Into It: How Starbucks Built a Company One Cup at a Time , the name of the company was derived from  Moby-Dick , although not in as direct a fashion as many assume. Gordon Bowker liked the name ""Pequod"" (the ship in the novel), but his then creative partner Terry Heckler responded, ""No one's going to drink a cup of Pee-quod!"" Heckler suggested ""Starbo"". Brainstorming with these two ideas resulted in the company being named for the  Pequod' s first mate, Starbuck. [ 20 ]          A Starbucks location in  Seoul ,  South Korea .

[ 22 ]  The logo has been significantly streamlined over the years. In the first version, which gave the impression of an authentic 15th century European  woodcut , the Starbucks siren was topless and had a fully visible double fish tail. The image also had a rough visual texture. In the second version, which was used from 1987-92, her breasts were covered by her flowing hair, but her  navel  was still visible, and the fish tail was cropped slightly. In the current version, used since 1992, her navel and breasts are not visible at all, and only vestiges remain of the fish tails. The original ""woodcut"" logo can still be seen on the Starbucks store in Seattle's Pike Place Market, and on both the House Blend and Decaf House Blend packaging.   At the beginning of September 2006 and then again in early 2008, Starbucks temporarily reintroduced its original brown logo on paper hot drink cups. Starbucks has stated that this was done to show the company's heritage from the Pacific Northwest and to celebrate 35 years of business. The vintage logo sparked some controversy due in part to the siren's bare breasts, [ 23 ]  but the temporary switch garnered little attention from the media. Starbucks had drawn similar criticism when they reintroduced the vintage logo in 2006. [ 24 ]     [ edit ]   Parodies and infringements           Dwyer's  parody logo which led to legal controversy       In 2000,  San Francisco   cartoonist   Kieron Dwyer  was sued by Starbucks for copyright and trademark infringement after creating a parody of its siren logo and putting it on coffee mugs, t-shirts, and stickers that he sold on his website and at comic book conventions. Dwyer felt that since his work was a parody it was protected by his right to  free speech  under U.S. law. The judge agreed that Dwyer's work was a parody and thus enjoyed constitutional protection; however, he was forbidden from financially ""profiting"" from using a ""confusingly similar"" image of the Starbucks siren logo. Dwyer is currently allowed to display the image as an expression of free speech, but he can no longer sell it. [ 25 ]   In 2003, Starbucks successfully sued a  Shanghai  competitor in  China  for  trademark infringement , because that chain used a green-and-white logo with a similar sounding Chinese name. [ 26 ]   Also in 2003, Starbucks sent a cease-and-desist letter to ""HaidaBucks Coffee House"" in  Masset, British Columbia ,  Canada . The store was owned by a group of young  Haida  men, commonly referred to as ""bucks."" After facing criticism, Starbucks dropped its demand after HaidaBucks dropped ""coffee house"" from its name. [ 27 ]   In 2005 Starbucks lost a trademark infringement case against a smaller coffee vendor in South Korea that operates coffee stations under the name and style Starpreya. The company, Elpreya, says Starpreya is named after the Norse goddess, Freja, with the letters of that name changed to ease pronunciation by Koreans. The court rejected the Seattle-based retailer's claim that the logo of Starpreya is too similar to the famous Starbucks logo. [ 28 ]   In 2008, Starbucks disputed the copyright application for Seattles  Rat City Rollergirls  logo after the paperwork was filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. [ 29 ]  The corporation claimed the roller derby leagues logo, by  Port Orchard , Washington artist  Krysztof Nemeth , [ 30 ]  was too similar to Starbucks. Starbucks requested an extension to further examine the issue and possibly issue a complaint, which was granted by the Trademark Office. The July 16, 2008 deadline passed without action by the corporation. [ 31 ]     [ edit ]   Environmental record          Starbucks inside  Tsutaya  in  Shibuya ,  Japan       In 1999, Starbucks started ""Grounds for your Garden"" to make their business more environment friendly. ""Grounds for your Garden"" is a year round program that gives leftover coffee grounds to anyone requesting it for composting. Although not all stores and regions participate, customers can request and rally their local Starbucks to begin the practice. In 2004, Starbucks made another contribution to improving the environment by reducing the size of their paper napkins and reducing the size of their store garbage bags. In 2004 alone they reduced over 1.8 million pounds of solid waste. [ 32 ] The U.S.  Food and Drug Administration  granted the first-ever approval to use recycled content in  food packaging  for Starbucks coffee cups. In 2005 the National Recycling Coalition Recycling Works Award went to Starbucks because of their major contributions to the environment. [ 33 ] Coffee and Farmer Equity (C.A.F.E) practices guidelines that are economically beneficial. Starbucks gets all of their coffee beans from farms; this basically ensures that farmers are not negatively affecting the environment while producing coffee beans for Starbucks. [ 34 ]  On a different note, environmentalists argue that Starbucks is not doing all they can to make it the most environment friendly place it can be. ""Dr. Allen Hershkowitz, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, says that Starbucks claimed they were using only 10 percent recycled material partly because the recycled material costs more."" [ 35 ]   In 2008, Starbucks was ranked #15 on the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency 's list of Top 25 Green Power Partners for purchases of renewable energy. [ 36 ]   In October 2008, The UK newspaper  The Sun  reported that Starbucks was wasting 23.4 million litres of water a day by leaving a tap constantly running for rinsing utensils in a ' dipper well ' in each of its stores worldwide. [ 37 ]     [ edit ]   Criticism and controversy          Starbucks at the  Forbidden City  in  Beijing  (closed since July 2007)       Several activist groups maintain websites criticizing the company's  fair-trade  policies, labor relations, and environmental impact, and hold it as a prime example of U.S. cultural and economic  imperialism . Several Starbucks locations were vandalized during the  WTO   meeting held in Seattle in late 1999 .   The Starbucks location in the former imperial palace in Beijing closed in July 2007. The coffee shop had been a source of ongoing controversy since its opening in 2000 with protesters objecting that the presence of the American chain in this location ""was trampling on Chinese culture"". [ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ]     [ edit ]   Anti-competitive tactics   Some of the methods Starbucks has used to expand and maintain their dominant market position include buying out competitors' leases, intentionally operating at a loss, and clustering several locations in a small geographical area (i.e., saturating the market), have been labeled anti-competitive by critics. [ 42 ]  For example, Starbucks fueled its initial expansion into the UK market with a buyout of Seattle Coffee Company, but then used its capital and influence to obtain prime locations, some of which operated at a financial loss. Critics claimed this was an unfair attempt to drive out small, independent competitors, who could not afford to pay inflated prices for premium real estate. [ 43 ]     [ edit ]   Labor disputes   Starbucks workers throughout seven different stores have joined the  Industrial Workers of the World  (IWW) as the  Starbucks Workers Union  since 2004. [ 44 ]          Starbucks in the  Financial District  of  Boston, Massachusetts       According to a Starbucks Union press release, since then, the union membership has begun expanding to Chicago and Maryland in addition to  New York City  where the movement originated. [ 45 ]  On March 7, 2006, the IWW and Starbucks agreed to a  National Labor Relations Board  settlement in which three Starbucks workers were granted almost US$2,000 in back wages and two fired employees were offered reinstatement. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ]  According to the Starbucks Union, on November 24, 2006, IWW members picketed Starbucks locations in more than 50 cities around the world in countries including Australia, Canada, Germany, and the UK, as well as U.S. cities including New York, Chicago, Minneapolis and San Francisco, [ 49 ]  to protest the firing of five Starbucks Workers Union organizers by Starbucks and to demand their reinstatement.   Some Starbucks baristas in Canada, [ 50 ]  Australia and New Zealand, [ 51 ]  and the United States [ 52 ]  belong to a variety of unions. In 2005, Starbucks paid out US$165,000 to eight employees at its Kent, Washington, roasting plant to settle charges that they had been retaliated against for being pro-union. At the time, the plant workers were represented by the  IUOE . Starbucks admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement. [ 44 ]          A Starbucks located in  Lima ,  Peru       A Starbucks strike occurred in  Auckland ,  New Zealand , on November 23, 2005. [ 51 ]  Organized by  Unite Union , workers sought secure hours, a  minimum wage  of NZ$12 an hour, and the abolition of youth rates. The company settled with the Union in 2006, resulting in pay increases, increased security of hours, and an improvement in youth rates. [ 53 ]   According to Starbucks Chairman Howard Schulz, ""If they had faith in me and my motives, they wouldn't need a union."" [ 54 ]  According to  The Seattle Times , ""The International Union of Operating Engineers Local 286 had trouble with Starbucks at its Kent roasting plant, where the union no longer represents workers"". [ 44 ]   In March 2008, Starbucks was ordered to pay  baristas  over  US$ 100 million in back tips in a  Californian   class action lawsuit  launched by baristas alleging that granting shift-supervisors a portion of  tips  violates state  labor laws . The Company plans to appeal. Similarly, an 18 year-old barista in Chestnut Hill, MA has just filed another suit with regards to the tipping policy. Massachusetts law also states that managers may not get a cut of tips.  [ 55 ] [ 56 ]  A similar lawsuit was also filed in Minnesota on March 27, 2008.  [ 57 ]     [ edit ]   Coffee bean market   In 2000, the company introduced a line of  fair trade  products. [ 58 ]   Of the approximately 136,000 tonnes (300 million pounds) of coffee Starbucks purchased in 2006, about 6 percent was certified as fair trade. [ 59 ]   According to Starbucks, they purchased 2,180 tonnes (4.8 million pounds) of Certified Fair Trade coffee in fiscal year 2004 and 5,220 tonnes (11.5 million pounds) in 2005. They have become the largest buyer of Certified Fair Trade coffee in North America (10% of the global market). Transfair USA, [ 60 ]  the only third-party certifier of Fair Trade Certified coffee in the United States, has noted the impact Starbucks has made in the area of Fair Trade and coffee farmer's lives by saying:       Since launching {its} FTC coffee line in 2000, Starbucks has undeniably made a significant contribution to family farmers through their rapidly growing FTC coffee volume. By offering FTC coffee in thousands of stores, Starbucks has also given the FTC label greater visibility, helping to raise consumer awareness in the process.       Groups such as  Global Exchange  are calling for Starbucks to further increase its sales of fair trade coffees. Fair trade certification can cost US$2,500 to US$10,000, based on the size of the producer group and length of time the inspections take, and many growers are unwilling or unable to pay for certification. [ 61 ]   Beyond Fair Trade Certification, Starbucks argues that it pays above market prices for all of its coffee. According to the company, in 2004 it paid on average $1.42 per pound ($2.64kg) for high-quality coffee beans. [ 62 ]  This is in comparison to commodity prices which were as low as $0.50$0.60 in 20032004. [ 63 ]     [ edit ]   Ethos water controversy          A Starbucks located in  Trujillo ,  Per       Ethos , a brand of bottled water acquired by Starbucks in 2005, is sold at locations throughout North America. Ethos bottles feature prominent labeling stating ""helping children get clean water"", referring to the fact that $.05 from each $1.80 bottle sold ($.10 per unit in Canada) is used to fund clean water projects in under-developed areas. Although sales of Ethos water have raised over $4,000,000 for clean water efforts, the brand is not a charity. Critics have argued that the claim on the label misleads consumers into thinking that Ethos is primarily a charitable organization, when it is actually a for-profit Starbucks brand and the vast majority of the sale price (over 94%) does not support clean-water projects. [ 64 ]   [ 65 ]  The founders of Ethos have stated that the brand is intended to raise awareness of third-world clean water issues and provide socially responsible consumers with an opportunity to support the cause by choosing Ethos over other brands. [ 66 ]  Starbucks has since redesigned the American version of the Ethos water bottles, stating the amount of money donated per bottle in the description.     [ edit ]   Brighton store opens in breach of planning regulations   In May 2008, a branch of Starbucks was completed in  Kemptown  on St. James's Street,  Brighton, England , despite having being refused permission by the local planning authority, Brighton and Hove City Council. They claimed there were too many coffee shops already present on the street. [ 67 ] [ 68 ]  Starbucks has appealed the decision, with Brighton and Hove council monitoring the situation. [ 69 ]   Brighton & Hove City Council have served Starbucks with an enforcement notice (which they have appealed) to remove all tables and chairs from the premises in order to comply with planning regulations and operate as an A1 retail shop, rather than an A3 coffee shop/restaurant, for which they have no planning permission. The deadline of the enforcement is 20 February 2009. [ 70 ]     [ edit ]   Rumors about the Israeli military   There are rumors that Starbucks sends part of its profits to the  Israeli military . [ 71 ]  In response to these rumors, Starbucks issued a statement saying Neither Chairman Howard Schultz nor Starbucks fund or support the Israeli Army. Starbucks is a non-political organization and does not support individual political causes. [ 72 ] [ 73 ] .   During the  20082009 IsraelGaza conflict , Starbucks became a target of protests by pro-Palestinian activists. Starbucks was forced to close a store in  Beirut ,  Lebanon  because of demonstrators shouting anti-Israel slogans and causing customers to flee. Protesters in Beirut told the  Associated Press  that they targeted Starbucks because they claim Chairman and CEO Howard Schultz donates money to the Israeli military. They hung several banners on the shop's window and used white tape to paste a  Star of David  over the green-and-white Starbucks sign. They also distributed a letter saying Schultz ""is one of the pillars of the American  Jewish lobby  and the owner of the Starbucks,"" which they said donates money to the Israeli military. Starbucks responded by saying ""Rumors that Starbucks Coffee Company and its management support Israel are unequivocally false. ... Starbucks is a nonpolitical organization and does not support political causes. Further, political preferences of a Starbucks partner [employee] at any level have absolutely no bearing on Starbucks company policies."" [ 74 ]     [ edit ]   Violence against Starbucks in the United Kingdom   On January 12, 2009, a Starbucks in Whitechapel Road in  London  was the target of vandalism by pro- Palestinian  demonstrators broke windows and reportedly ripped out fittings and equipment after clashes with riot police. Later the same day, after midnight, a suspected makeshift firebomb was hurled into the premises, causing further damage. [ 74 ] [ 75 ] [ 76 ]   On January 17, 2009, at an anti-Israel protest held by the  Stop the War Coalition  in  Trafalgar Square  in central  London , British Rapper  Lowkey  stated, with regard to Starbucks, that: ""You say you know about the Zionist lobby but you put money in their pockets every time youre buying their coffee."" After the rally, two groups of people, many wearing scarves over their faces, smashed and looted two Starbucks on Piccadilly and Shaftesbury Avenue. Although the Starbucks stores had requested greater police protection following the violence against a Starbucks the previous week,  Scotland Yard  stated it could ""not stop thugs hell-bent on causing damage."" [ 77 ] [ 75 ] [ 78 ] [ 79 ]     [ edit ]   Accusations by Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi   In a sermon delivered by Muslim cleric Sheikh  Yusuf al-Qaradawi , which aired on  Al Jazeera TV  on January 9, 2009 (as translated by MEMRI), Al-Qaradhawi accused Starbucks of supporting Israeli education and the Isreali Army and called for a boycott of the company and other western chains [ 80 ] . Al-Qaradawi has previously called for a similar boycott of all US products with limited success [ 81 ] . Starbucks has not commented directly on Al-Qaradawi's accusations, but has in the past, denied supporting Israel or any other political action  [ 74 ] .     [ edit ]   Other ventures       Main article:  Hear Music       Starbucks entered the music industry in 1999 with the acquisition of Hear Music, and the film industry in 2006 with the creation of Starbucks Entertainment. Starbucks Entertainment was one of the producers of the 2006 film  Akeelah and the Bee . Retail stores heavily advertised the film before its release.   Hear Music is the brand name of Starbucks' retail music concept. Hear Music began as a catalog company in 1990 and was purchased by Starbucks in 1999. Nearly three years later, in 2002, they produced a Starbucks opera album, featuring artists such as  Luciano Pavarotti .     [ edit ]   Partnership with Apple   Starbucks has agreed to a partnership with  Apple  to collaborate on selling music as part of the coffeehouse experience. In October 2006, Apple added a Starbucks Entertainment area to the  iTunes Store , selling similar music that appeared in Starbucks stores. In September 2007 Apple announced that there would be wireless communication between Apple and Starbucks. Through the AT&T Wi-Fi, a paywall is opened up to allow any individual connecting to AT&T wifi access to the  iTunes Store  (regardless of whether he or she is an AT&T subscriber). The partnership is primarily targeted at  iPhone ,  iPod Touch , and  Macbook  users (although anyone with access to iTunes can take advantage of it). In addition, the iTunes Store will automatically detect the current and last 10 songs playing in a Starbucks and offer users connected to the store's wireless network the opportunity to download the tracks. This feature has been rolled out in  Seattle ,  New York City , and the  San Francisco Bay Area , and will slowly be offered in limited markets during 20072008. [ 82 ]  During the fall of 2007, Starbucks also began to sell digital downloads of certain albums through iTunes. The buyer would buy the download at Starbucks, and enter the code on the download card at the iTunes Store, and then the entire album would immediately start downloading. From October 2 to November 7, 2007, Starbucks gave away 37 different songs for free download through iTunes as part of the ""Song of the Day"" promotion. Each day, baristas would give out download cards for a particular song which could be redeemed on iTunes. Currently, every Tuesday, a new ""Pick of the Week"" download card is available at Starbucks for a free song download, similar to its previous ""Song of the Day.""

You have inspired us and, frankly, challenged us with your ideas.    So today, it is with great excitement that we unveil Starbucks™ Shared Planet™, our commitment to doing business responsibly – to help create a better future for everyone and the world we all share.   It may come as a surprise that during these challenging economic times we are investing in some of these programs. But in many ways, this is nothing new for us. Starbucks™ Shared Planet™ represents our long-standing commitment to being a responsible company and the journey we’ve been on since the early days of Starbucks.    Now we are stepping up our efforts in a big way and we’re declaring several aspirational goals to keep us accountable to you and to ourselves.    By 2015, we plan to meet the following goals:  •  Environmental stewardship : 100% of our cups will be reusable or recyclable, and we will significantly reduce our environmental footprint through recycling, energy and water conservation and green construction. To achieve this goal, we will:         - Have a recyclable cup developed and launched by 2012         - Have 25% of the cups used in our stores be reusable         - Have recycling available in our stores          - Fifty percent of the energy used in our company-owned stores will come from renewable sources by 2010         - Reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by making our company-owned stores 25 percent more energy efficient by 2010         - Have a significant reduction in water usage (percent determined by March 2009)         - All new company-owned stores will be certified green by 2010         - Champion tropical rainforest protection as a solution to climate change •  Ethical sourcing : buy and serve 100% responsibly grown and ethically traded coffee. To achieve this goal and further support the farmers who produce our coffee, we also plan to:         - Purchase 100 percent of our coffee through ethical sourcing practices         - Invest in a better future for farmers and their communities by nearly doubling funding to organizations that provide farmer loans from $12.5 to $20 million         - Proactively impact climate change by offering farmers incentives to prevent deforestation beginning with pilot programs in Sumatra, Indonesia and Chiapas, Mexico. •  Community involvement : contribute one million community service hours annually. To meet this goal we will:         - Contribute more than 1 million community service hours per year in communities where we do business.          - Engage 50,000 social entrepreneurs to innovate and take action, who will in turn inspire 100,000 individuals to take action in their communities. These commitments will help ensure our future. We need a healthy environment and farmers that are paid well so that we can continue to bring you the high-quality coffee that you expect from us. We want to care for our communities because it is community that makes us who we are – that third place in your neighborhood.

I'm a Starbucks junkie and very proud of the many responsible things Starbucks has done with respect to coffee bean sourcing. I'm delighted to hear that the goal is to reach 100% sourced by either C.A.F.E. practice - or I presume some percentage of that will be Fair Trade - by the year 2015.   In furtherance of these CSR goals, I would like to see Starbucks publish more information about what percentage of their farmers do not get accepted as C.A.F.E. certified, and in particular, what percentage of Starbucks farmers are scoring above 80% on the C.A.F.E. practices scorecard.  My hope for Starbucks is that they will put in place strong incentives to tenaciously encourage farmers to have higher scores on their C.A.F.E. practices scorecard.

These are the kinds of measurable goals I was hoping for. I would like to see a goal/number on the increase in store recycling, but this is a start.   I am far less enthusiastic about the ethical sourcing commitment. The numbers quoted in the press release and the inclusion of Conservation International really point to one thing - C.A.F.E., and as regular readers of this site know, Starbucks and I differ sharply on the definitions of ethical, sustainable coffee sourcing as it applies to your C.A.F.E. program.   It's really shame that Starbucks has committed to the deeply flawed C.A.F.E. to the virtual exclusion of all other ethical sourcing programs, but in the end not surprising.    So on the recycling commitment, congratulations and when & where can we see the first fruits? What are you going to start on next?

One year, twice as much!  That's what I and many others have been asking for.    And they will explore integrating C.A.F.E. and Fair Trade certifications. The other thing I've been asking for.   That's the best news I've heard on this subject since I've been on this site.    Now, I am beginning to believe that Starbucks is truly committed to ethical coffee sourcing and not just window dressing.   Yes, much remains to be done and a letter of intent is a long way from results, but this is an important step in the right direction.   Well done Starbucks!                                                                                                                                                                                                               mguiste                               10/31/2008 11:38 AM                                                                                                                                           Thanks for the note, UrbanVoy.  Been a hectic week and you found it before I could tell you about it!  Yes, as a company we are very serious about this topic and I think you'll find the ""sharp differences"" become much less so over the coming months.  :)                                                                                                                                                                                                               UrbanVoy                               10/31/2008 2:31 PM                                                                                                                                          sbx_Matt said:   ""I think you'll find the ""sharp differences"" become much less so over the coming months.""   I think could be right - I hope so. I'm encouraged that Starbucks has worked out a cooperative and mutually beneficial understanding with TransFair and FLO.    To me, it shows Starbucks is willing to be part of the international ethical agriculture community and not go it alone - even if it means not getting everything Starbucks wants. It's a good sign.

Every day millions hold it in their hand and if it says made from recycled materials and able to be recycled itself - all those people will see it. It is the badge/emblem of your brand that people touch and carry. When you see a stuffed trash can in the store full of cups and debris from people mixing their drinks you immediately wonder ""couldn't that be done with less waste""? Your other goals (store energy use reduction etc) are appropriate and i think well intentioned. But for your image and public perception no question you need to focus on the cups. Don't get distracted by all the other good ""green"" ideas. Put your $ behind the cup solution and branding/communicating it on the cup itself.  Think of the cup as your best marketing tool to your existing customer base. Better than email, TV, print  or any other vehicle. Everyone has to see it when they bring it too their mouth!

Starbucks is the largest  coffeehouse  company in the world, [ 2 ]  with 16,120 stores in 44 countries. [ 3 ]  Starbucks sells  drip brewed coffee ,  espresso -based hot drinks, other hot and cold drinks, snacks, and items such as mugs and coffee beans. Through the Starbucks Entertainment division and  Hear Music  brand, the company also markets books, music, and film. Many of the company's products are seasonal or specific to the locality of the store. Starbucks-brand ice cream and coffee are also sold at grocery stores.   From Starbucks' founding in Seattle as a local  coffee bean  roaster and retailer, the company has expanded rapidly. In the 1990s, Starbucks was opening a new store every workday, a pace that continued into the 2000s. Domestic growth has since slowed, although the company continues to expand in foreign markets and will open a net of 900 new stores outside of the U.S. in 2009. [ 4 ]  The first location outside of the United States and Canada was established in 1990s, and they now constitute almost one third of Starbucks' stores. [ 5 ]   As of early 2009, Starbucks has more than 16,000 stores in 58 countries worldwide, 11,006 of which are located in the United States, followed by Canada with 976 and Japan with 845 locations. On July 1, 2008, the company announced it was closing 600 under-performing company-owned stores and cutting U.S. expansion plans amid growing economic uncertainty. [ 6 ] [ 7 ]  On July 29, 2008, Starbucks also cut almost 1,000 non-retail jobs as part of its bid to re-energize the brand and boost its profit. Of the new cuts, 550 of the positions are layoffs and the rest are unfilled jobs. [ 8 ]  These closings and layoffs have effectively ended the companys period of growth and expansion that began in the mid-1990s.   On January 28, 2009, Starbucks announced the closure of an additional 300 under-performing stores, and the elimination of 7,000 positions. CEO Howard Schultz also announced that he had received board approval to reduce his salary.

Located in the old Sears, Roebuck and Co. catalog distribution center building.       The original Starbucks was opened in Pike Place Market in Seattle, Washington, in 1971 by three partners: English teacher  Jerry Baldwin , history teacher  Zev Siegel , and writer  Gordon Bowker . The three were inspired by  Alfred Peet , whom they knew personally, to open their first store in  Pike Place Market  to sell high-quality coffee beans and equipment. The original Starbucks location was at 2000 Western Avenue from 19711976. That store then moved to 1912 Pike Place; it is still open. During their first year of operation, they purchased green  coffee beans  from  Peet's , then began buying directly from growers.   Entrepreneur  Howard Schultz  joined the company in 1982, and, after a trip to  Milan, Italy , advised that the company should sell coffee and  espresso  drinks as well as beans. The owners rejected this idea, believing that getting into the beverage business would distract the company from its primary focus. To them,  coffee  was something to be prepared in the home. Certain that there was much money to be made selling drinks to on-the-go Americans, Schultz started the  Il Giornale  coffee bar chain in 1985.   In 1984, the original owners of Starbucks, led by Baldwin, took the opportunity to purchase Peet's (Baldwin still works there today). In 1987, they sold the Starbucks chain to Schultz's Il Giornale, which rebranded the Il Giornale outlets as Starbucks and quickly began to expand. Starbucks opened its first locations outside Seattle at  Waterfront Station  in  Vancouver ,  British Columbia , and  Chicago ,  Illinois , that same year. At the time of its  initial public offering  on the stock market in 1992, Starbucks had grown to 165 outlets.    The first Starbucks location outside of North America opened in  Tokyo  in 1996. Starbucks entered the  U.K.  market in 1998 with the acquisition of the then 60-outlet, UK-based Seattle Coffee Company, re-branding all its stores as Starbucks. By November 2005,  London  had more outlets than  Manhattan , [ 10 ]  a sign of Starbucks becoming an international brand.          A Starbucks coffee shop in  Leeds ,  United Kingdom       In 1999, Starbucks experimented with eateries in the San Francisco Bay area through a restaurant chain called Circadia. [ 11 ]  These restaurants were soon ""outed"" as Starbucks establishments and converted to Starbucks cafes.   In April 2003, Starbucks completed the purchase of  Seattle's Best Coffee  and  Torrefazione Italia  from  AFC Enterprises , bringing the total number of Starbucks-operated locations worldwide to more than 6,400. On September 14, 2006, rival  Diedrich Coffee  announced that it would sell most of its company-owned retail stores to Starbucks. This sale includes the company-owned locations of the Oregon-based  Coffee People  chain. Starbucks has converted the Diedrich Coffee and Coffee People locations to Starbucks as of summer 2007, although the Portland airport Coffee People locations were excluded from the sale. [ 12 ] [ 13 ]   Starbucks' chairman,  Howard Schultz , has talked about making sure growth does not dilute the company's culture  [ 14 ]  and the common goal of the company's leadership to act like a small company.          The first Starbucks branch.       In January 2008, Chairman  Howard Schultz  resumed his roles as President and Chief Executive Officer after an eight year hiatus, and replaced Jim Donald, who took those posts in 2005 but decided to leave the company in late 2007. Schultz's principal challenge is to restore what he calls the ""distinctive Starbucks experience"" in the face of rapid expansion. Analysts believe that Schultz must determine how to contend with higher materials prices and enhanced competition from lower-price fast food chains, including  McDonald's  and  Dunkin' Donuts . On January 31, 2008, Schultz announced that Starbucks would discontinue its warm breakfast sandwich products, originally scheduled to launch nationwide in 2008, in order to refocus the brand on all things coffee. On February 23, Starbucks closed its stores from 5:30 p.m. to 9 p.m. local time to train its baristas. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]   As Starbucks often tests new products as part of its ongoing innovation and transformation, Starbucks started testing selling an 8 oz ""short"" brewed coffee for $1 and giving free refills on all brewed coffee. This test was limited to the greater Seattle market, with no plans for expansion to national markets. Per an internal email this program was cancelled in late March 2008.          A typical sales area, this one in  Peterborough ,  UK , showing a display of food and the beverage preparation area       In March 2008, Schultz made several announcements to Starbucks  shareholders . Shultz introduced Starbucks' ""state of the art espresso system"", [ 17 ]  the  Thermoplan AG  manufactured Mastrena, which replaced their previous superauto, the Thermoplan Verismo 801(known internationally as the Thermoplan Black & White). Starbucks also announced that the company hopes to enter the energy drink market and introduce a customer reward program. Pre-ground beans will also no longer be used, in order that the additional grinding of all whole bean coffee will ""bring aroma, romance and theater"" to American stores. [ 18 ]  The company also announced the recent acquisition of The Coffee Equipment Company, [ 17 ]  the manufacturer of the Clover Brewing System. They are currently test marketing this unique ""fresh-pressed"" coffee system at six Starbucks locations, three in Seattle, and three in Boston. [ 19 ]   In May 2008, a rewards program was initiated for registered users of the Starbucks Card. Previously simply a gift card, the Starbucks Card has undergone a transition into a rewards card, similar to cards offered by other retail outlets. Perks and rewards offered to registered users are 2 hours of free Wi-Fi Internet service per day, free refills of brewed coffee (some locations only honour this for the first 3 hours of your stay), a free tall beverage with the purchase of 1 lb. of whole bean coffee, as well as free milk (e.g. soy) and syrup drink modifiers. [ 20 ]  This is a new and aggressive approach by Starbucks to create and strengthen customer loyalty.   Tags displaying the title ""Master"" are worn by employees who have completed the Coffee Master course, which educates employees in not only the tasting, but also growing regions, roasting, and purchasing (including  fair trade  practices) aspects of the coffee industry. Almost 70% of the coffee used by Starbucks around the world comes from the sixth major producer in the world,  Guatemala , a pro-organic producer.   Starting in November of 2008 Starbucks began selling Product Red goods. According to the website because of this they have been able to provide AIDS medicine for 3,800 for an entire year. [ 21 ]     [ edit ]   Intellectual property   Starbucks U.S. Brands, LLC, is a Starbucks-owned company that currently holds and owns the property rights to approximately 120 Starbucks Coffee Company patents and trademarks. It is located at 2525 Starbucks Way in  Minden, Nevada . [ 22 ]     [ edit ]   Name   The company is named in part after  Starbuck ,  Captain Ahab 's  first mate  in the book  Moby-Dick , as well as a turn-of-the-century mining camp ( Starbo  or  Storbo ) on  Mount Rainier . According to  Howard Schultz 's book  Pour Your Heart Into It: How Starbucks Built a Company One Cup at a Time , the name of the company was derived from  Moby-Dick , although not in as direct a fashion as many assume. Gordon Bowker liked the name ""Pequod"" (the ship in the novel), but his then creative partner Terry Heckler responded, ""No one's going to drink a cup of Pee-quod!"" Heckler suggested ""Starbo"". Brainstorming with these two ideas resulted in the company being named for the  Pequod' s first mate, Starbuck. [ 23 ]          A Starbucks location in the  insa-dong  district of  Seoul ,  South Korea . This particular location is a rarity in that the main sign is not written in  English .       International names include:     Arabic -speaking countries:  (transliteration:  strbaks )   Bulgaria :  (transliteration:  Starbks )   China ,  Hong Kong ,  Macau ,  Taiwan :   Pinyin : xngbk ( xng means ""star"", while  is a  transliteration  of ""-bucks"")   Israel :  (transliteration:  srbaqs )   Japan :  (transliteration:  sutbakkusu , phonological:  staa-bahkss )   Russia :  (transliteration:  Starbaks )   South Korea :  (transliteration:  seutabeokseu ), often used in conjunction with the English name   Quebec ,  Canada : Caf Starbucks Coffee [ 24 ]   Thailand :  pronounced  [satbk]       [ edit ]   Logo          Original brown logo              ""Abraxas"" - Louvre       Valerie O'Neil, a Starbucks spokeswoman, said that the logo is an image of a ""twin-tailed siren"" (the  siren  of  Greek mythology ). [ 25 ]  The logo has been significantly streamlined over the years. In the first version, which gave the impression of an authentic 15th century European  woodcut , the Starbucks siren was topless and had a fully visible double fish tail. The image also had a rough visual texture. In the second version, which was used from 1987-92, her breasts were covered by her flowing hair, but her  navel  was still visible, and the fish tail was cropped slightly. In the current version, used since 1992, her navel and breasts are not visible at all, and only vestiges remain of the fish tails. The original ""woodcut"" logo can still be seen on the Starbucks store in Seattle's Pike Place Market, and on both the House Blend and Decaf House Blend packaging.   At the beginning of September 2006 and then again in early 2008, Starbucks temporarily reintroduced its original brown logo on paper hot drink cups. Starbucks has stated that this was done to show the company's heritage from the Pacific Northwest and to celebrate 35 years of business. The vintage logo sparked some controversy due in part to the siren's bare breasts, [ 26 ]  but the temporary switch garnered little attention from the media. Starbucks had drawn similar criticism when they reintroduced the vintage logo in 2006. [ 27 ]     [ edit ]   Parodies and infringements     [ edit ]   Environmental record          Starbucks inside  Tsutaya  in  Shibuya ,  Japan       In 1999, Starbucks started ""Grounds for your Garden"" to make their business more environment friendly. ""Grounds for your Garden"" is a year round program that gives leftover coffee grounds to anyone requesting it for composting. Although not all stores and regions participate, customers can request and rally their local Starbucks to begin the practice. In 2004, Starbucks began reducing the size of their paper napkins and store garbage bags, and lightening their solid waste production by 1.8 million pounds. [ 28 ] The U.S.  Food and Drug Administration  granted the first-ever approval to use recycled content in  food packaging  for Starbucks coffee cups. In 2005 Starbucks received the National Recycling Coalition Recycling Works Award. [ 29 ]  In 2008, Starbucks was ranked #15 on the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency 's list of Top 25 Green Power Partners for purchases of renewable energy. [ 30 ]   Starbucks has also received criticism from environmentalists. ""Dr. Allen Hershkowitz, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, says that Starbucks claimed they were using only 10 percent recycled material partly because the recycled material costs more."" [ 31 ]  In October 2008, The UK newspaper  The Sun  reported that Starbucks was wasting 23.4 million litres of water a day by leaving a tap constantly running for rinsing utensils in a ' dipper well ' in each of its stores worldwide. [ 32 ]   Does anyone know other environmental impact stats for Starbucks annually-- Asiachai  ( talk ) 17:30, 16 March 2009 (UTC)     [ edit ]   Criticism and controversy          Starbucks at the  Forbidden City  in  Beijing  (closed since July 2007)       Several activist groups maintain websites criticizing the company's  fair-trade  policies, labor relations, and environmental impact, and hold it as a prime example of U.S. cultural and economic  imperialism . Several Starbucks locations were vandalized during the  WTO   meeting held in Seattle in late 1999 .   The Starbucks location in the former imperial palace in Beijing closed in July 2007. The coffee shop had been a source of ongoing controversy since its opening in 2000 with protesters objecting that the presence of the American chain in this location ""was trampling on Chinese culture"". [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ]     [ edit ]   Anti-competitive tactics   Some of the methods Starbucks has used to expand and maintain their dominant market position include buying out competitors' leases, intentionally operating at a loss, and clustering several locations in a small geographical area (i.e., saturating the market), have been labeled anti-competitive by critics. [ 37 ]  For example, Starbucks fueled its initial expansion into the UK market with a buyout of Seattle Coffee Company, but then used its capital and influence to obtain prime locations, some of which operated at a financial loss. Critics claimed this was an unfair attempt to drive out small, independent competitors, who could not afford to pay inflated prices for premium real estate. [ 38 ]     [ edit ]   Labor disputes   Starbucks workers throughout seven different stores have joined the  Industrial Workers of the World  (IWW) as the  Starbucks Workers Union  since 2004. [ 39 ]          Starbucks in the  Financial District  of  Boston, Massachusetts       According to a Starbucks Union press release, since then, the union membership has begun expanding to Chicago and Maryland in addition to  New York City  where the movement originated. [ 40 ]  On March 7, 2006, the IWW and Starbucks agreed to a  National Labor Relations Board  settlement in which three Starbucks workers were granted almost US$2,000 in back wages and two fired employees were offered reinstatement. [ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ]  According to the Starbucks Union, on November 24, 2006, IWW members picketed Starbucks locations in more than 50 cities around the world in countries including Australia, Canada, Germany, and the UK, as well as U.S. cities including New York, Chicago, Minneapolis and San Francisco, [ 44 ]  to protest the firing of five Starbucks Workers Union organizers by Starbucks and to demand their reinstatement.   Some Starbucks baristas in Canada, [ 45 ]  Australia and New Zealand, [ 46 ]  and the United States [ 47 ]  belong to a variety of unions. In 2005, Starbucks paid out US$165,000 to eight employees at its Kent, Washington, roasting plant to settle charges that they had been retaliated against for being pro-union. At the time, the plant workers were represented by the  IUOE . Starbucks admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement. [ 39 ]          A Starbucks located in  Lima ,  Peru       A Starbucks strike occurred in  Auckland ,  New Zealand , on November 23, 2005. [ 46 ]  Organized by  Unite Union , workers sought secure hours, a  minimum wage  of NZ$12 an hour, and the abolition of youth rates. The company settled with the Union in 2006, resulting in pay increases, increased security of hours, and an improvement in youth rates. [ 48 ]   According to Starbucks Chairman Howard Schulz, ""If they had faith in me and my motives, they wouldn't need a union."" [ 49 ]  According to  The Seattle Times , ""The International Union of Operating Engineers Local 286 had trouble with Starbucks at its Kent roasting plant, where the union no longer represents workers"". [ 39 ]   In March 2008, Starbucks was ordered to pay  baristas  over  US$ 100 million in back tips in a  Californian   class action lawsuit  launched by baristas alleging that granting shift-supervisors a portion of  tips  violates state  labor laws . The Company plans to appeal. Similarly, an 18 year-old barista in Chestnut Hill, MA has just filed another suit with regards to the tipping policy. Massachusetts law also states that managers may not get a cut of tips.  [ 50 ] [ 51 ]  A similar lawsuit was also filed in Minnesota on March 27, 2008.  [ 52 ]     [ edit ]   Coffee bean market   In 2000, the company introduced a line of  fair trade  products. [ 53 ]   Of the approximately 136,000 tonnes (300 million pounds) of coffee Starbucks purchased in 2006, about 6 percent was certified as fair trade. [ 54 ]   According to Starbucks, they purchased 2,180 tonnes (4.8 million pounds) of Certified Fair Trade coffee in fiscal year 2004 and 5,220 tonnes (11.5 million pounds) in 2005. They have become the largest buyer of Certified Fair Trade coffee in North America (10% of the global market). Transfair USA, [ 55 ]  the only third-party certifier of Fair Trade Certified coffee in the United States, has noted the impact Starbucks has made in the area of Fair Trade and coffee farmer's lives by saying:       Since launching {its} FTC coffee line in 2000, Starbucks has undeniably made a significant contribution to family farmers through their rapidly growing FTC coffee volume. By offering FTC coffee in thousands of stores, Starbucks has also given the FTC label greater visibility, helping to raise consumer awareness in the process.       Groups such as  Global Exchange  are calling for Starbucks to further increase its sales of fair trade coffees. Fair trade certification can cost US$2,500 to US$10,000, based on the size of the producer group and length of time the inspections take, and many growers are unwilling or unable to pay for certification. [ 56 ]   Beyond Fair Trade Certification, Starbucks argues that it pays above market prices for all of its coffee. According to the company, in 2004 it paid on average $1.42 per pound ($2.64kg) for high-quality coffee beans. [ 57 ]  This is in comparison to commodity prices which were as low as $0.50$0.60 in 20032004. [ 58 ]     [ edit ]   Ethos water controversy          A Starbucks located in  Trujillo ,  Per       Ethos , a brand of bottled water acquired by Starbucks in 2005, is sold at locations throughout North America. Ethos bottles feature prominent labeling stating ""helping children get clean water"", referring to the fact that $.05 from each $1.80 bottle sold ($.10 per unit in Canada) is used to fund clean water projects in under-developed areas. Although sales of Ethos water have raised over $6,200,000 for clean water efforts, the brand is not a charity. Critics have argued that the claim on the label misleads consumers into thinking that Ethos is primarily a charitable organization, when it is actually a for-profit Starbucks brand and the vast majority of the sale price (97.2%) does not support clean-water projects. [ 59 ] [ 60 ]  The founders of Ethos have stated that the brand is intended to raise awareness of third-world clean water issues and provide socially responsible consumers with an opportunity to support the cause by choosing Ethos over other brands. [ 61 ]  Starbucks has since redesigned the American version of the Ethos water bottles, stating the amount of money donated per bottle in the description.     [ edit ]   Brighton store opens in breach of planning regulations   In May 2008, a branch of Starbucks was completed in  Kemptown  on St. James's Street,  Brighton, England , despite having being refused permission by the local planning authority, Brighton and Hove City Council. They claimed there were too many coffee shops already present on the street. [ 62 ] [ 63 ]  Starbucks has appealed the decision, with Brighton and Hove council monitoring the situation. [ 64 ]   Brighton & Hove City Council have served Starbucks with an enforcement notice (which they have appealed) to remove all tables and chairs from the premises in order to comply with planning regulations and operate as an A1 retail shop, rather than an A3 coffee shop/restaurant, for which they have no planning permission. The deadline of the enforcement is 20 February 2009. [ 65 ]     [ edit ]   Alleged relationship with the Israeli military   There have been calls for boycott of Starbucks stores and products because it is alleged that Starbucks sends part of its profits to the  Israeli military . [ 66 ]  It has been long alleged that Schultz is ""an active  Zionist ""  [ 67 ]  and is a recipient of several Israeli awards including ""The Israel 50th Anniversary Tribute Award"" for ""playing a key role in promoting a close alliance between the United States and Israel."" [ 68 ]  In response to these allegations Starbucks issued a statement saying Neither Chairman Howard Schultz nor Starbucks fund or support the Israeli Army. Starbucks is a non-political organization and does not support individual political causes. [ 69 ]  Starbucks has been a regular target of activists protesting against the  Israeli intervention in Gaza . Starbucks was forced to close a store in  Beirut ,  Lebanon  because of demonstrators shouting anti-Israel slogans and causing customers to flee. [ 70 ]  Protesters in Beirut told the  Associated Press  that they targeted Starbucks because they claim Chairman and CEO Howard Schultz donates money to the Israeli military. They hung several banners on the shop's window and used white tape to paste a  Star of David  over the green-and-white Starbucks sign. They also distributed a letter saying Schultz ""is one of the pillars of the American  Jewish lobby  and the owner of the Starbucks,"" which they said donates money to the Israeli military. [ 71 ]  Starbucks responded by saying ""Rumors that Starbucks Coffee Company and its management support Israel are unequivocally false. ... Starbucks is a nonpolitical organization and does not support political causes. Further, political preferences of a Starbucks partner [employee] at any level have absolutely no bearing on Starbucks company policies."" [ 72 ]     [ edit ]   Violence against Starbucks in the United Kingdom   On January 12, 2009, a Starbucks in Whitechapel Road in  London  was the target of vandalism by pro- Palestinian  demonstrators broke windows and reportedly ripped out fittings and equipment after clashes with riot police. Later the same day, after midnight, a suspected makeshift firebomb was hurled into the premises, causing further damage. [ 73 ] [ 74 ] [ 75 ]   On January 17, 2009, at an anti-Israel protest held by the  Stop the War Coalition  in  Trafalgar Square  in central  London , British Rapper  Lowkey  stated, with regard to Starbucks, that: ""You say you know about the Zionist lobby but you put money in their pockets every time youre buying their coffee."" After the rally, two groups of people, many wearing scarves over their faces, smashed and looted two Starbucks on Piccadilly and Shaftesbury Avenue. Although the Starbucks stores had requested greater police protection following the violence against a Starbucks the previous week,  Scotland Yard  stated it could ""not stop thugs hell-bent on causing damage."" [ 76 ] [ 74 ] [ 77 ] [ 78 ]     [ edit ]   Accusations by Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi   In a sermon delivered by Muslim cleric Sheikh  Yusuf al-Qaradawi , which aired on  Al Jazeera TV  on January 9, 2009 (as translated by MEMRI), Al-Qaradhawi accused Starbucks of supporting Israeli education and the Israeli Army and called for a boycott of the company and other western chains. [ 79 ]  Al-Qaradawi has previously called for a similar boycott of all US products with limited success. [ 80 ]  Starbucks has not commented directly on Al-Qaradawi's accusations, but has in the past, denied supporting Israel or any other political action. [ 73 ]     [ edit ]   Other ventures   Main article:  Hear Music   Starbucks entered the music industry in 1999 with the acquisition of Hear Music, and the film industry in 2006 with the creation of Starbucks Entertainment. Starbucks Entertainment was one of the producers of the 2006 film  Akeelah and the Bee . Retail stores heavily advertised the film before its release.   Hear Music is the brand name of Starbucks' retail music concept. Hear Music began as a catalog company in 1990 and was purchased by Starbucks in 1999. Nearly three years later, in 2002, they produced a Starbucks opera album, featuring artists such as  Luciano Pavarotti .     [ edit ]   Partnership with Apple   Starbucks has agreed to a partnership with  Apple  to collaborate on selling music as part of the coffeehouse experience. In October 2006, Apple added a Starbucks Entertainment area to the  iTunes Store , selling similar music that appeared in Starbucks stores. In September 2007 Apple announced that there would be wireless communication between Apple and Starbucks. Through the AT&T Wi-Fi, a paywall is opened up to allow any individual connecting to AT&T wifi access to the  iTunes Store  (regardless of whether he or she is an AT&T subscriber). The partnership is primarily targeted at  iPhone ,  iPod Touch , and  Macbook  users (although anyone with access to iTunes can take advantage of it). In addition, the iTunes Store will automatically detect the current and last 10 songs playing in a Starbucks and offer users connected to the store's wireless network the opportunity to download the tracks. This feature has been rolled out in  Seattle ,  New York City , and the  San Francisco Bay Area , and will slowly be offered in limited markets during 20072008. [ 81 ]  During the fall of 2007, Starbucks also began to sell digital downloads of certain albums through iTunes. The buyer would buy the download at Starbucks, and enter the code on the download card at the iTunes Store, and then the entire album would immediately start downloading. From October 2 to November 7, 2007, Starbucks gave away 37 different songs for free download through iTunes as part of the ""Song of the Day"" promotion. Each day, baristas would give out download cards for a particular song which could be redeemed on iTunes. Currently, every Tuesday, a new ""Pick of the Week"" download card is available at Starbucks for a free song download, similar to its previous ""Song of the Day.""

clueweb09-enwp02-04-04640	"                     Starbucks Workers Union          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search          The  Starbucks Workers Union  is a  union  formed by the  Industrial Workers of the World  (IWW) to organize retail employees of  Starbucks Coffee Company . The union has members at Starbucks locations in  New York City ,  Chicago ,  Grand Rapids, Michigan ,  Cincinnati, Ohio , and  Bloomington, Minnesota [ 1 ]           Contents       1   Origin   2   Legal actions   3   Ongoing campaigns     3.1   Global Day of Action   3.2   Bean2Cup Campaign       4   References   5   External links               [ edit ]   Origin   On  May 17 ,  2004 , Starbucks's workers at the 36th and Madison store in midtown Manhattan organized the first Starbucks barista  union  in the United States. The union drive had its origins in barista's complaints that a starting wage of $7.75 an hour was not a  living wage  in New York City and that Starbucks refused to guarantee regularity of hours per week. The union has also joined with  Global Exchange  in calling on Starbucks to purchase at least 5% of the store's coffee from  fair trade  certified sources. The 12 workers submitted union cards to the  National Labor Relations Board  (NLRB) for a certification election. Prior to the election, Starbucks filed an appeal with the NLRB, asking that the election be extended to several stores, not the single store that filed for an election. The NLRB agreed to review the appeal and impound the ballots at the Madison Avenue store. The IWW subsequently withdrew the election petition because the appeal could cause a several-year delay in the validation of the election. [ 2 ]  Starbucks claims the union withdrew due to a lack of interest by Starbucks workers. [ 3 ]  The IWW usually does not get involved in the NLRB election process, but rather focuses on winning incremental demands on the shop-floor through the practice of ""Solidarity Unionism."" [ 4 ]  On this basis, the organizing drive continues at Starbucks locations across the world.     [ edit ]   Legal actions   The union filed an  unfair labor practice  charge against Starbucks in which it alleged the company prohibited workers from distributing union leaflets or wearing union buttons while they were at work. The company settled the charge with the  National Labor Relations Board  in March 2006. The company did not admit it had broken the law, but did agree to post notices explaining workers' rights under the  National Labor Relations Act  at three of its stores. In addition, it was forced to allow two employees to return to work and compensate three workers for lost wages in an amount less than $2,000. [ 5 ]  The union claims that four of its members have been fired for union activities, a charge the company denies.   On  January 14 ,  2005 , charges stemming from a march during the  2004 Republican National Convention  were dropped against union co-founder Daniel Gross. Witnesses allege Starbucks's managers coordinated with the  NYPD  to single out Daniel Gross and another union activist from a crowd of 200 protesters. [ 6 ]   In June and August 2006, several organizers were fired by Starbucks, including union co-founder Daniel Gross who Starbucks claims made a threatening remark to a district manager at a union rally. Gross denies the charge. The  NLRB  is currently reviewing the circumstances of the dismissals. [ 7 ]   On May 17, 2007 union baristas in Grand Rapids, Michigan announced they also were filing Unfair Labor Practice charges with the NLRB based on Starbucks reaction to the union drive there.   On July 11, 2008 union baristas in Minneapolis, MN filed an unfair labor practice over the firing of IWW barista Erik Forman. After an escalating campaign of direct action, including a petition and a work stoppage at the Mall of America location, Starbucks offered Forman his job back and later settled with the NLRB.     [ edit ]   Ongoing campaigns   On Friday, June 16, 2006 the Starbucks employees working at the 135 E. 57th Street store in Manhattan made public their IWW membership and presented a list of demands to management to improve working conditions. This was the 5th Starbucks store in New York to establish a public organizing committee and make collective demands from the company. [ 8 ]   Baristas at Chicagos Logan Square Starbucks store announced on August 29, 2006 their membership in the IWW Starbucks Workers Union, becoming the first U.S. workers outside of New York City to declare union membership. A set of demands was given to the management team including a living wage, guaranteed work hours, reinstatement of IWW baristas allegedly fired for organizing activity, and respect for an independent voice on the job through union membership. [ 1 ]   In August, 2006, A group of union members filed a complaint with the United States  Occupational Safety and Health Administration , alleging that three of Starbucks's Manhattan stores violate basic health standards. OSHA inspected the locations and found two serious hazards, as well as a number of less serious hazards. [ 9 ] . The group is demanding the company increase staffing levels and provide elbow-length gloves. [ 10 ] [ 11 ]   In July 2008, baristas at the Mall of America I Starbucks announced their membership in the union, demanding seniority-based severance pay and the right to transfer for workers at closing stores.   The organizing campaign is ongoing in Minneapolis and cities across the United States, and is growing in Europe and around the world.     [ edit ]   Global Day of Action   On July 5, 2008, the Industrial Workers of the World and the  International Workers Association  joined forces in a Global Day of Action against Starbucks anti-union practices. Starbucks had illegally fired Cole Dorsey, a Grand Rapids, MI baristas, and Monica, a  CNT  barista in Sevilla, Spain in early 2008. Actions took place in over 20 countries around the world, highlighting the global reach of the Starbucks Workers Union campaign.     [ edit ]   Bean2Cup Campaign   The Starbucks Workers Union has a student activism campaign to increase the wages and working conditions of farmers who sell coffee to Starbucks, increase purchasing transparency of Starbucks coffee beans, and raise awareness about the social consequences of drinking Starbucks coffee.

Starbucks focuses on customer experience, one big reason the company's outlets can charge a premium for its beverages and other offerings.       Photo by Richard Brian              There's a disconnect between the way consumers think they buy and the way they actually do.      Eight out of 10 consumers say they want to make buying decisions based on fact and reason, but seven of 10 say they actually make those decisions based on emotion.      And that's why one expert business consultant says smart businesses should focus on customer experience as much as the product they sell.      ""For the longest time in our history what we sold were commodities,"" said Dr. Joseph Michelli, author of ""The Starbucks Experience: 5 Principles for Turning the Ordinary Into the Extraordinary."" ""We no longer extract, deliver or make anything. We provide experiences. Service is now a commodity.""      Michelli spoke at the recent Embarq XTREME Business Breakfast at South Point.      He said customer experience - the theater that gives buyers that feeling of intimacy with their salesperson - is as important as the product they're buying.      That's what makes a cup of coffee that's worth a nickle as a commodity and 50 cents at a convenience store is worth $4 at Starbucks.      About 95 percent of business leaders realize customer experience is key to success, and 80 percent say they know the difference makers in their business are no longer product-based.      Still, half of consumers say the majority of their buying experiences are bland or boring.      And while 92 percent of business owners say they have great customer service, most surveyed customers disagree.      That's because too many businesses are inward looking, Michelli said, focused on streamlining operations, being efficient and having protocol and regulations. They never consider the drag on productivity and sales that forgetting the customer and his needs can have.      ""Inward-looking companies are very efficient, but they run employees into the ground,"" Michelli said. ""And when you go to a business that makes you do things their way, you feel stupid. Businesses that focus on their own process alienate the customer.""      Instead, listen to the customer, stand on the other side of the counter now and again and give your customers an emotional experience.      And much of experience is about perception and fantasy, Michelli said.      Best Buy's Geek Squad, for example, isn't really a platoon of pocket protector-wearing nerds. But depicting them in commercials as geeks makes them seem more knowledgeable and gives consumers trust.      Geek Squad's commercials say, ""We've spent more time with Windows Vista than is socially acceptable,"" Michelli said. ""That's a fantasy.""      But as long as the service performs, we're happy to believe in it.      Michelli said there are five steps to taking your business from product to experience, from ordinary to extraordinary.      Make it your own: The most important part of any business is its people, and businesses that give their people ownership - both emotional and literal - in the company are much more likely to succeed.      Starbucks, for example, offers health insurance to any employee who works 20 hours a week, gives immediate stock options to all employees and empowers workers to make the customer's experience stellar every time.      When Starbucks had stores in only three markets - Seattle, Chicago and Los Angeles - it was a front-of-the-house employee who turned around Los Angeles' stagnant first store by inventing the vanilla frappuccino. Starbucks now sells more ice blended drinks like the frappuccino than it does hot coffee.      ""People near the customer know what the customer wants,"" said Michelli.       Everything matters:  Details really matter, especially when it comes to the customer experience. While your product or service must always be consistent, everything from the decor to the toilet paper must be in keeping with your theme, in Starbucks' case ""affordable luxury.""      Surprise and delight: Starbucks worked very hard to making sure that a Starbucks coffee would taste the same in Denver and Dublin and Dubai. The product and the experience should always be the same.      But by creating in-store surprises, the company captures customers' imaginations.      Starbucks spends more on in-store samples than on advertising, Michelli said, in order to create the unexpected.       Embrace resistance:  ""Starbucks is not loved by everybody,"" Michelli said. In fact, many hate the coffee giant.      But Michelli said Starbucks takes criticism seriously, and learns from it.      He used the example of a Starbucks ad for fruity iced drinks that came out after 9/11. The add featured two tall drinks with a firefly buzzing around then and the tag line, ""Collapse into cool."" Although it takes several logical leaps to get from fruity drinks to collapsing trade towers, many survivors and victim family members made those leaps and were offended by the ad. Rather than defending the ad, which was clearly not meant to depict the World Trade Center, Starbucks simply pulled the ads.      Michelli said companies should embrace criticism and accept responsibility, use the dialogue as a way to improve relationships and use criticism to improve function.       Leave your mark:  Although many companies initially get involved in corporate giving or community involvement as a PR measure, ""once you really start loving the community it becomes addictive,"" Michelli said.      Starbucks has a unique corporate giving philosophy. The company only donates money to organizations in which its employees are involved, a different way of vetting worthy charities. And Starbucks matches an employees volunteer hours with a donation equal to their salary for those hours up to $1,000 when employees give time out of their own lives.      Responsible businesses should find ways to leave their mark on the world through volunteerism, fundraising, community grants or through a revision of their own business practices, he said. Doing the right thing has a way of coming back around to help business, as well.

Starbucks is the largest  coffeehouse  company in the world, [ 2 ]  with 16,120 stores in 44 countries. [ 3 ]  Starbucks sells  drip brewed coffee ,  espresso -based hot drinks, other hot and cold drinks, snacks, and items such as mugs and coffee beans. Through the Starbucks Entertainment division and  Hear Music  brand, the company also markets books, music, and film. Many of the company's products are seasonal or specific to the locality of the store. Starbucks-brand ice cream and coffee are also sold at grocery stores.   From Starbucks' founding in Seattle as a local  coffee bean  roaster and retailer, the company has expanded rapidly. In the 1990s, Starbucks was opening a new store every workday, a pace that continued into the 2000s. Domestic growth has since slowed, although the company continues to expand in foreign markets and will open a net of 900 new stores outside of the U.S. in 2009. [ 4 ]  The first location outside of the United States and Canada was established in 1990s, and they now constitute almost one third of Starbucks' stores. [ 5 ]   By late March 2008, Starbucks had more than 16,226 stores worldwide, including 11,434 stores located in the United States. On July 1, 2008, the company announced it was closing 600 under-performing company-owned stores and cutting U.S. expansion plans amid growing economic uncertainty. [ 6 ] [ 7 ]  On July 29, 2008, Starbucks also cut almost 1,000 non-retail jobs as part of its bid to re-energize the brand and boost its profit. Of the new cuts, 550 of the positions are layoffs and the rest are unfilled jobs. [ 8 ]  These closings and layoffs have effectively ended the companys period of growth and expansion that began in the mid-1990s.   On January 28, 2009, Starbucks announced the closure of an additional 300 under-performing stores, and the elimination of 7,000 positions. CEO Howard Schultz also announced that he had received board approval to reduce his salary to $10,000 per year.

Located in the old Sears, Roebuck and Co. catalog distribution center building.       The original Starbucks was opened in Pike Place Market in Seattle, Washington, in 1971 by three partners: English teacher  Jerry Baldwin , history teacher  Zev Siegel , and writer  Gordon Bowker . The three were inspired by  Alfred Peet , whom they knew personally, to open their first store in  Pike Place Market  to sell high-quality coffee beans and equipment. The original Starbucks location was at 2000 Western Avenue from 19711976. That store then moved to 1912 Pike Place; it is still open. During their first year of operation, they purchased green  coffee beans  from  Peet's , then began buying directly from growers.   Entrepreneur  Howard Schultz  joined the company in 1983, and, after a trip to  Milan, Italy , advised that the company should sell coffee and  espresso  drinks as well as beans. The owners rejected this idea, believing that getting into the beverage business would distract the company from its primary focus. To them,  coffee  was something to be prepared in the home. Certain that there was much money to be made selling drinks to on-the-go Americans, Schultz started the  Il Giornale  coffee bar chain in 1985.   In 1984, the original owners of Starbucks, led by Baldwin, took the opportunity to purchase Peet's (Baldwin still works there today). In 1987, they sold the Starbucks chain to Schultz's Il Giornale, which rebranded the Il Giornale outlets as Starbucks and quickly began to expand. Starbucks opened its first locations outside Seattle at  Waterfront Station  in  Vancouver ,  British Columbia , and  Chicago ,  Illinois , that same year. At the time of its  initial public offering  on the stock market in 1992, Starbucks had grown to 165 outlets.    The first Starbucks location outside of North America opened in  Tokyo  in 1996. Starbucks entered the  U.K.  market in 1998 with the acquisition of the then 60-outlet, UK-based Seattle Coffee Company, re-branding all its stores as Starbucks. By November 2005,  London  had more outlets than  Manhattan , [ 10 ]  a sign of Starbucks becoming an international brand.          A Starbucks coffee shop in  Leeds ,  United Kingdom       In 1999, Starbucks experimented with eateries in the San Francisco Bay area through a restaurant chain called Circadia. [ 11 ]  These restaurants were soon ""outed"" as Starbucks establishments and converted to Starbucks cafes.   In April 2003, Starbucks completed the purchase of  Seattle's Best Coffee  and  Torrefazione Italia  from  AFC Enterprises , bringing the total number of Starbucks-operated locations worldwide to more than 6,400. On September 14, 2006, rival  Diedrich Coffee  announced that it would sell most of its company-owned retail stores to Starbucks. This sale includes the company-owned locations of the Oregon-based  Coffee People  chain. Starbucks has converted the Diedrich Coffee and Coffee People locations to Starbucks as of summer 2007, although the Portland airport Coffee People locations were excluded from the sale.  [ 12 ] [ 13 ]   Starbucks' chairman,  Howard Schultz , has talked about making sure growth does not dilute the company's culture  [ 14 ]  and the common goal of the company's leadership to act like a small company.          The first Starbucks branch.       In January 2008, Chairman  Howard Schultz  resumed his roles as President and Chief Executive Officer after an eight year hiatus, and replaced Jim Donald, who took those posts in 2005 but decided to leave the company in late 2007. Schultz's principal challenge is to restore what he calls the ""distinctive Starbucks experience"" in the face of rapid expansion. Analysts believe that Schultz must determine how to contend with higher materials prices and enhanced competition from lower-price fast food chains, including  McDonald's  and  Dunkin' Donuts . On January 31, 2008, Schultz announced that Starbucks would discontinue its warm breakfast sandwich products, originally scheduled to launch nationwide in 2008, in order to refocus the brand on all things coffee.   As Starbucks often tests new products as part of its ongoing innovation and transformation, Starbucks started testing selling an 8 oz ""short"" brewed coffee for $1 and giving free refills on all brewed coffee. This test was limited to the greater Seattle market, with no plans for expansion to national markets. Per an internal email this program was cancelled in late March 2008.          A typical sales area, this one in  Peterborough ,  UK , showing a display of food and the beverage preparation area       In March 2008, Schultz made several announcements to Starbucks  shareholders . Shultz introduced Starbucks' ""state of the art espresso system"", [ 15 ]  the  Thermoplan AG  manufactured Mastrena, which replaced their previous superauto, the Thermoplan Verismo 801(known internationally as the Thermoplan Black & White). Starbucks also announced that the company hopes to enter the energy drink market and introduce a customer reward program. Pre-ground beans will also no longer be used, in order that the additional grinding of all whole bean coffee will ""bring aroma, romance and theater"" to American stores.  [ 16 ]  The company also announced the recent acquisition of The Coffee Equipment Company, [ 15 ]  the manufacturer of the Clover Brewing System. They are currently test marketing this unique ""fresh-pressed"" coffee system at six Starbucks locations, three in Seattle, and three in Boston. [ 17 ]   In May 2008, a rewards program was initiated for registered users of the Starbucks Card. Previously simply a gift card, the Starbucks Card has undergone a transition into a rewards card, similar to cards offered by other retail outlets. Perks and rewards offered to registered users are 2 hours of free Wi-Fi Internet service per day, free refills of brewed coffee (some locations only honour this for the first 3 hours of your stay), a free tall beverage with the purchase of 1 lb. of whole bean coffee, as well as free milk (e.g. soy) and syrup drink modifiers.  [ 18 ]  This is a new and aggressive approach by Starbucks to create and strengthen customer loyalty.   Tags displaying the title ""Master"" are worn by employees who have completed the Coffee Master course, which educates employees in not only the tasting, but also growing regions, roasting, and purchasing (including  fair trade  practices) aspects of the coffee industry. Almost the 70% of the coffee used by Starbucks around the world came from the sixth major producer in the world,  Guatemala , a pro-organic producer.     [ edit ]   Intellectual property   Starbucks U.S. Brands, LLC, is a Starbucks-owned company that currently holds and owns the property rights to approximately 120 Starbucks Coffee Company patents and trademarks. It is located at 2525 Starbucks Way in  Minden, Nevada . [ 19 ]     [ edit ]   Name   The company is named in part after  Starbuck ,  Captain Ahab 's  first mate  in the book  Moby-Dick , as well as a turn-of-the-century mining camp ( Starbo  or  Storbo ) on  Mount Rainier . According to  Howard Schultz 's book  Pour Your Heart Into It: How Starbucks Built a Company One Cup at a Time , the name of the company was derived from  Moby-Dick , although not in as direct a fashion as many assume. Gordon Bowker liked the name ""Pequod"" (the ship in the novel), but his then creative partner Terry Heckler responded, ""No one's going to drink a cup of Pee-quod!"" Heckler suggested ""Starbo"". Brainstorming with these two ideas resulted in the company being named for the  Pequod' s first mate, Starbuck. [ 20 ]          A Starbucks location in  Seoul ,  South Korea .

International names include:     Arabic -speaking countries:  (transliteration:  strbaks )   Bulgaria :  (transliteration:  Starbks )   China ,  Hong Kong ,  Macau ,  Taiwan :   Pinyin : xngbk ( xng means ""star"", while  is a  transliteration  of ""-bucks"")   Israel :  (transliteration:  srbaqs )   Japan :  (transliteration:  sutbakkusu , phonological:  staa-bahkss )   Russia :  (transliteration:  Starbaks )   South Korea :  (transliteration:  seutabeokseu ), often used in conjunction with the English name   Quebec ,  Canada : Caf Starbucks Coffee [ 21 ]   Thailand :  pronounced  [satbk]       [ edit ]   Logo          Original brown logo              ""Abraxas"" - Louvre       Valerie O'Neil, a Starbucks spokeswoman, said that the logo is an image of a ""twin-tailed siren"" (the  siren  of  Greek mythology ). [ 22 ]  The logo has been significantly streamlined over the years. In the first version, which gave the impression of an authentic 15th century European  woodcut , the Starbucks siren was topless and had a fully visible double fish tail. The image also had a rough visual texture. In the second version, which was used from 1987-92, her breasts were covered by her flowing hair, but her  navel  was still visible, and the fish tail was cropped slightly. In the current version, used since 1992, her navel and breasts are not visible at all, and only vestiges remain of the fish tails. The original ""woodcut"" logo can still be seen on the Starbucks store in Seattle's Pike Place Market, and on both the House Blend and Decaf House Blend packaging.   At the beginning of September 2006 and then again in early 2008, Starbucks temporarily reintroduced its original brown logo on paper hot drink cups. Starbucks has stated that this was done to show the company's heritage from the Pacific Northwest and to celebrate 35 years of business. The vintage logo sparked some controversy due in part to the siren's bare breasts, [ 23 ]  but the temporary switch garnered little attention from the media. Starbucks had drawn similar criticism when they reintroduced the vintage logo in 2006. [ 24 ]     [ edit ]   Parodies and infringements           Dwyer's  parody logo which led to legal controversy       In 2000,  San Francisco   cartoonist   Kieron Dwyer  was sued by Starbucks for copyright and trademark infringement after creating a parody of its siren logo and putting it on the cover of one of his comics; later placing it on coffee mugs, t-shirts, and stickers that he sold on his website and at comic book conventions. Dwyer felt that since his work was a parody it was protected by his right to  free speech  under U.S. law. The case was settled  out of court , as Dwyer claimed he did not have the financial abilty to endure a trial case with Starbucks. The judge agreed that Dwyer's work was a parody and thus enjoyed constitutional protection; however, he was forbidden from financially ""profiting"" from using a ""confusingly similar"" image of the Starbucks siren logo. Dwyer is currently allowed to display the image as an expression of free speech, but he can no longer sell it. [ 25 ]   In 2003, Starbucks successfully sued a  Shanghai  competitor in  China  for  trademark infringement , because that chain used a green-and-white logo with a similar sounding Chinese name. [ 26 ]   Also in 2003, Starbucks sent a cease-and-desist letter to ""HaidaBucks Coffee House"" in  Masset, British Columbia ,  Canada . The store was owned by a group of young  Haida  men, commonly referred to as ""bucks."" After facing criticism, Starbucks dropped its demand after HaidaBucks dropped ""coffee house"" from its name. [ 27 ]   In 2005 Starbucks lost a trademark infringement case against a smaller coffee vendor in South Korea that operates coffee stations under the name and style Starpreya. The company, Elpreya, says Starpreya is named after the Norse goddess, Freja, with the letters of that name changed to ease pronunciation by Koreans. The court rejected the Seattle-based retailer's claim that the logo of Starpreya is too similar to the famous Starbucks logo. [ 28 ]   In 2008, Starbucks disputed the copyright application for Seattles  Rat City Rollergirls  logo after the paperwork was filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. [ 29 ]  The corporation claimed the roller derby leagues logo, by  Port Orchard , Washington artist  Krysztof Nemeth , [ 30 ]  was too similar to Starbucks. Starbucks requested an extension to further examine the issue and possibly issue a complaint, which was granted by the Trademark Office. The July 16, 2008 deadline passed without action by the corporation. [ 31 ]     [ edit ]   Environmental record          Starbucks inside  Tsutaya  in  Shibuya ,  Japan       In 1999, Starbucks started ""Grounds for your Garden"" to make their business more environment friendly. ""Grounds for your Garden"" is a year round program that gives leftover coffee grounds to anyone requesting it for composting. Although not all stores and regions participate, customers can request and rally their local Starbucks to begin the practice. In 2004, Starbucks made another contribution to improving the environment by reducing the size of their paper napkins and reducing the size of their store garbage bags. In 2004 alone they reduced over 1.8 million pounds of solid waste. [ 32 ] The U.S.  Food and Drug Administration  granted the first-ever approval to use recycled content in  food packaging  for Starbucks coffee cups. In 2005 the National Recycling Coalition Recycling Works Award went to Starbucks because of their major contributions to the environment. [ 33 ] Coffee and Farmer Equity (C.A.F.E) practices guidelines that are economically beneficial. Starbucks gets all of their coffee beans from farms; this basically ensures that farmers are not negatively affecting the environment while producing coffee beans for Starbucks. [ 34 ]  On a different note, environmentalists argue that Starbucks is not doing all they can to make it the most environment friendly place it can be. ""Dr. Allen Hershkowitz, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, says that Starbucks claimed they were using only 10 percent recycled material partly because the recycled material costs more."" [ 35 ]   In 2008, Starbucks was ranked #15 on the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency 's list of Top 25 Green Power Partners for purchases of renewable energy. [ 36 ]   In October 2008, The UK newspaper  The Sun  reported that Starbucks was wasting 23.4 million litres of water a day by leaving a tap constantly running for rinsing utensils in a ' dipper well ' in each of its stores worldwide. [ 37 ]     [ edit ]   Criticism and controversy          Starbucks at the  Forbidden City  in  Beijing  (closed since July 2007)       Several activist groups maintain websites criticizing the company's  fair-trade  policies, labor relations, and environmental impact, and hold it as a prime example of U.S. cultural and economic  imperialism . Several Starbucks locations were vandalized during the  WTO   meeting held in Seattle in late 1999 .   The Starbucks location in the former imperial palace in Beijing closed in July 2007. The coffee shop had been a source of ongoing controversy since its opening in 2000 with protesters objecting that the presence of the American chain in this location ""was trampling on Chinese culture"". [ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ]     [ edit ]   Anti-competitive tactics   Some of the methods Starbucks has used to expand and maintain their dominant market position include buying out competitors' leases, intentionally operating at a loss, and clustering several locations in a small geographical area (i.e., saturating the market), have been labeled anti-competitive by critics. [ 42 ]  For example, Starbucks fueled its initial expansion into the UK market with a buyout of Seattle Coffee Company, but then used its capital and influence to obtain prime locations, some of which operated at a financial loss. Critics claimed this was an unfair attempt to drive out small, independent competitors, who could not afford to pay inflated prices for premium real estate. [ 43 ]     [ edit ]   Labor disputes   Starbucks workers throughout seven different stores have joined the  Industrial Workers of the World  (IWW) as the  Starbucks Workers Union  since 2004. [ 44 ]          Starbucks in the  Financial District  of  Boston, Massachusetts       According to a Starbucks Union press release, since then, the union membership has begun expanding to Chicago and Maryland in addition to  New York City  where the movement originated. [ 45 ]  On March 7, 2006, the IWW and Starbucks agreed to a  National Labor Relations Board  settlement in which three Starbucks workers were granted almost US$2,000 in back wages and two fired employees were offered reinstatement. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ]  According to the Starbucks Union, on November 24, 2006, IWW members picketed Starbucks locations in more than 50 cities around the world in countries including Australia, Canada, Germany, and the UK, as well as U.S. cities including New York, Chicago, Minneapolis and San Francisco, [ 49 ]  to protest the firing of five Starbucks Workers Union organizers by Starbucks and to demand their reinstatement.   Some Starbucks baristas in Canada, [ 50 ]  Australia and New Zealand, [ 51 ]  and the United States [ 52 ]  belong to a variety of unions. In 2005, Starbucks paid out US$165,000 to eight employees at its Kent, Washington, roasting plant to settle charges that they had been retaliated against for being pro-union. At the time, the plant workers were represented by the  IUOE . Starbucks admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement. [ 44 ]          A Starbucks located in  Lima ,  Peru       A Starbucks strike occurred in  Auckland ,  New Zealand , on November 23, 2005. [ 51 ]  Organized by  Unite Union , workers sought secure hours, a  minimum wage  of NZ$12 an hour, and the abolition of youth rates. The company settled with the Union in 2006, resulting in pay increases, increased security of hours, and an improvement in youth rates. [ 53 ]   According to Starbucks Chairman Howard Schulz, ""If they had faith in me and my motives, they wouldn't need a union."" [ 54 ]  According to  The Seattle Times , ""The International Union of Operating Engineers Local 286 had trouble with Starbucks at its Kent roasting plant, where the union no longer represents workers"". [ 44 ]   In March 2008, Starbucks was ordered to pay  baristas  over  US$ 100 million in back tips in a  Californian   class action lawsuit  launched by baristas alleging that granting shift-supervisors a portion of  tips  violates state  labor laws . The Company plans to appeal. Similarly, an 18 year-old barista in Chestnut Hill, MA has just filed another suit with regards to the tipping policy. Massachusetts law also states that managers may not get a cut of tips.  [ 55 ] [ 56 ]  A similar lawsuit was also filed in Minnesota on March 27, 2008.  [ 57 ]     [ edit ]   Coffee bean market   In 2000, the company introduced a line of  fair trade  products. [ 58 ]   Of the approximately 136,000 tonnes (300 million pounds) of coffee Starbucks purchased in 2006, about 6 percent was certified as fair trade. [ 59 ]   According to Starbucks, they purchased 2,180 tonnes (4.8 million pounds) of Certified Fair Trade coffee in fiscal year 2004 and 5,220 tonnes (11.5 million pounds) in 2005. They have become the largest buyer of Certified Fair Trade coffee in North America (10% of the global market). Transfair USA, [ 60 ]  the only third-party certifier of Fair Trade Certified coffee in the United States, has noted the impact Starbucks has made in the area of Fair Trade and coffee farmer's lives by saying:       Since launching {its} FTC coffee line in 2000, Starbucks has undeniably made a significant contribution to family farmers through their rapidly growing FTC coffee volume. By offering FTC coffee in thousands of stores, Starbucks has also given the FTC label greater visibility, helping to raise consumer awareness in the process.       Groups such as  Global Exchange  are calling for Starbucks to further increase its sales of fair trade coffees. Fair trade certification can cost US$2,500 to US$10,000, based on the size of the producer group and length of time the inspections take, and many growers are unwilling or unable to pay for certification. [ 61 ]   Beyond Fair Trade Certification, Starbucks argues that it pays above market prices for all of its coffee. According to the company, in 2004 it paid on average $1.42 per pound ($2.64kg) for high-quality coffee beans. [ 62 ]  This is in comparison to commodity prices which were as low as $0.50$0.60 in 20032004. [ 63 ]     [ edit ]   Ethos water controversy          A Starbucks located in  Trujillo ,  Per       Ethos , a brand of bottled water acquired by Starbucks in 2005, is sold at locations throughout North America. Ethos bottles feature prominent labeling stating ""helping children get clean water"", referring to the fact that $.05 from each $1.80 bottle sold ($.10 per unit in Canada) is used to fund clean water projects in under-developed areas. Although sales of Ethos water have raised over $4,000,000 for clean water efforts, the brand is not a charity. Critics have argued that the claim on the label misleads consumers into thinking that Ethos is primarily a charitable organization, when it is actually a for-profit Starbucks brand and the vast majority of the sale price (over 94%) does not support clean-water projects. [ 64 ]   [ 65 ]  The founders of Ethos have stated that the brand is intended to raise awareness of third-world clean water issues and provide socially responsible consumers with an opportunity to support the cause by choosing Ethos over other brands. [ 66 ]  Starbucks has since redesigned the American version of the Ethos water bottles, stating the amount of money donated per bottle in the description.     [ edit ]   Brighton store opens in breach of planning regulations   In May 2008, a branch of Starbucks was completed in  Kemptown  on St. James's Street,  Brighton, England , despite having being refused permission by the local planning authority, Brighton and Hove City Council. They claimed there were too many coffee shops already present on the street. [ 67 ] [ 68 ]  Starbucks has appealed the decision, with Brighton and Hove council monitoring the situation. [ 69 ]   Brighton & Hove City Council have served Starbucks with an enforcement notice (which they have appealed) to remove all tables and chairs from the premises in order to comply with planning regulations and operate as an A1 retail shop, rather than an A3 coffee shop/restaurant, for which they have no planning permission. The deadline of the enforcement is 20 February 2009. [ 70 ]     [ edit ]   Alleged relationship with the Israeli military   There have been calls for boycott of Starbucks stores and products because it is alleged that Starbucks sends part of its profits to the  Israeli military . [ 71 ]  This charge is leveled due to the fact that the President, Chairman and CEO of Starbucks  Howard Schultz  is  Jewish . It has been long alleged that Schultz is ""an active  Zionist ""  [ 72 ]  and is a recipient of several Israeli awards including ""The Israel 50th Anniversary Tribute Award"" for ""playing a key role in promoting a close alliance between the United States and Israel."" [ 73 ]  In response to these allegations Starbucks issued a statement saying Neither Chairman Howard Schultz nor Starbucks fund or support the Israeli Army. Starbucks is a non-political organization and does not support individual political causes. [ 74 ]  Starbucks has been a regular target of activists protesting against the  Israeli intervention in Gaza . Starbucks was forced to close a store in  Beirut ,  Lebanon  because of demonstrators shouting anti-Israel slogans and causing customers to flee. [ 75 ]  Protesters in Beirut told the  Associated Press  that they targeted Starbucks because they claim Chairman and CEO Howard Schultz donates money to the Israeli military. They hung several banners on the shop's window and used white tape to paste a  Star of David  over the green-and-white Starbucks sign. They also distributed a letter saying Schultz ""is one of the pillars of the American  Jewish lobby  and the owner of the Starbucks,"" which they said donates money to the Israeli military. [ 76 ]  Starbucks responded by saying ""Rumors that Starbucks Coffee Company and its management support Israel are unequivocally false. ... Starbucks is a nonpolitical organization and does not support political causes. Further, political preferences of a Starbucks partner [employee] at any level have absolutely no bearing on Starbucks company policies."" [ 77 ]     [ edit ]   Violence against Starbucks in the United Kingdom   On January 12, 2009, a Starbucks in Whitechapel Road in  London  was the target of vandalism by pro- Palestinian  demonstrators broke windows and reportedly ripped out fittings and equipment after clashes with riot police. Later the same day, after midnight, a suspected makeshift firebomb was hurled into the premises, causing further damage. [ 78 ] [ 79 ] [ 80 ]   On January 17, 2009, at an anti-Israel protest held by the  Stop the War Coalition  in  Trafalgar Square  in central  London , British Rapper  Lowkey  stated, with regard to Starbucks, that: ""You say you know about the Zionist lobby but you put money in their pockets every time youre buying their coffee."" After the rally, two groups of people, many wearing scarves over their faces, smashed and looted two Starbucks on Piccadilly and Shaftesbury Avenue. Although the Starbucks stores had requested greater police protection following the violence against a Starbucks the previous week,  Scotland Yard  stated it could ""not stop thugs hell-bent on causing damage."" [ 81 ] [ 79 ] [ 82 ] [ 83 ]     [ edit ]   Accusations by Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi   In a sermon delivered by Muslim cleric Sheikh  Yusuf al-Qaradawi , which aired on  Al Jazeera TV  on January 9, 2009 (as translated by MEMRI), Al-Qaradhawi accused Starbucks of supporting Israeli education and the Isreali Army and called for a boycott of the company and other western chains [ 84 ] . Al-Qaradawi has previously called for a similar boycott of all US products with limited success [ 85 ] . Starbucks has not commented directly on Al-Qaradawi's accusations, but has in the past, denied supporting Israel or any other political action  [ 78 ] .     [ edit ]   Other ventures       Main article:  Hear Music       Starbucks entered the music industry in 1999 with the acquisition of Hear Music, and the film industry in 2006 with the creation of Starbucks Entertainment. Starbucks Entertainment was one of the producers of the 2006 film  Akeelah and the Bee . Retail stores heavily advertised the film before its release.   Hear Music is the brand name of Starbucks' retail music concept. Hear Music began as a catalog company in 1990 and was purchased by Starbucks in 1999. Nearly three years later, in 2002, they produced a Starbucks opera album, featuring artists such as  Luciano Pavarotti .     [ edit ]   Partnership with Apple   Starbucks has agreed to a partnership with  Apple  to collaborate on selling music as part of the coffeehouse experience. In October 2006, Apple added a Starbucks Entertainment area to the  iTunes Store , selling similar music that appeared in Starbucks stores. In September 2007 Apple announced that there would be wireless communication between Apple and Starbucks. Through the AT&T Wi-Fi, a paywall is opened up to allow any individual connecting to AT&T wifi access to the  iTunes Store  (regardless of whether he or she is an AT&T subscriber). The partnership is primarily targeted at  iPhone ,  iPod Touch , and  Macbook  users (although anyone with access to iTunes can take advantage of it). In addition, the iTunes Store will automatically detect the current and last 10 songs playing in a Starbucks and offer users connected to the store's wireless network the opportunity to download the tracks. This feature has been rolled out in  Seattle ,  New York City , and the  San Francisco Bay Area , and will slowly be offered in limited markets during 20072008. [ 86 ]  During the fall of 2007, Starbucks also began to sell digital downloads of certain albums through iTunes. The buyer would buy the download at Starbucks, and enter the code on the download card at the iTunes Store, and then the entire album would immediately start downloading. From October 2 to November 7, 2007, Starbucks gave away 37 different songs for free download through iTunes as part of the ""Song of the Day"" promotion. Each day, baristas would give out download cards for a particular song which could be redeemed on iTunes. Currently, every Tuesday, a new ""Pick of the Week"" download card is available at Starbucks for a free song download, similar to its previous ""Song of the Day.""

Starbucks is the largest  coffeehouse  company in the world, [ 2 ]  with 16,120 stores in 44 countries. [ 3 ]  Starbucks sells  drip brewed coffee ,  espresso -based hot drinks, other hot and cold drinks, snacks, and items such as mugs and coffee beans. Through the Starbucks Entertainment division and  Hear Music  brand, the company also markets books, music, and film. Many of the company's products are seasonal or specific to the locality of the store. Starbucks-brand ice cream and coffee are also sold at grocery stores.   From Starbucks' founding in Seattle as a local  coffee bean  roaster and retailer, the company has expanded rapidly. In the 1990s, Starbucks was opening a new store every workday, a pace that continued into the 2000s. Domestic growth has since slowed, although the company continues to expand in foreign markets and will open a net of 900 new stores outside of the U.S. in 2009. [ 4 ]  The first location outside of the United States and Canada was established in 1990s, and they now constitute almost one third of Starbucks' stores. [ 5 ]   As of early 2009, Starbucks has more than 16,000 stores in 58 countries worldwide, 11,006 of which are located in the United States, followed by Canada with 976 and Japan with 845 locations. On July 1, 2008, the company announced it was closing 600 under-performing company-owned stores and cutting U.S. expansion plans amid growing economic uncertainty. [ 6 ] [ 7 ]  On July 29, 2008, Starbucks also cut almost 1,000 non-retail jobs as part of its bid to re-energize the brand and boost its profit. Of the new cuts, 550 of the positions are layoffs and the rest are unfilled jobs. [ 8 ]  These closings and layoffs have effectively ended the companys period of growth and expansion that began in the mid-1990s.   On January 28, 2009, Starbucks announced the closure of an additional 300 under-performing stores, and the elimination of 7,000 positions. CEO Howard Schultz also announced that he had received board approval to reduce his salary.

Located in the old Sears, Roebuck and Co. catalog distribution center building.       The original Starbucks was opened in Pike Place Market in Seattle, Washington, in 1971 by three partners: English teacher  Jerry Baldwin , history teacher  Zev Siegel , and writer  Gordon Bowker . The three were inspired by  Alfred Peet , whom they knew personally, to open their first store in  Pike Place Market  to sell high-quality coffee beans and equipment. The original Starbucks location was at 2000 Western Avenue from 19711976. That store then moved to 1912 Pike Place; it is still open. During their first year of operation, they purchased green  coffee beans  from  Peet's , then began buying directly from growers.   Entrepreneur  Howard Schultz  joined the company in 1982, and, after a trip to  Milan, Italy , advised that the company should sell coffee and  espresso  drinks as well as beans. The owners rejected this idea, believing that getting into the beverage business would distract the company from its primary focus. To them,  coffee  was something to be prepared in the home. Certain that there was much money to be made selling drinks to on-the-go Americans, Schultz started the  Il Giornale  coffee bar chain in 1985.   In 1984, the original owners of Starbucks, led by Baldwin, took the opportunity to purchase Peet's (Baldwin still works there today). In 1987, they sold the Starbucks chain to Schultz's Il Giornale, which rebranded the Il Giornale outlets as Starbucks and quickly began to expand. Starbucks opened its first locations outside Seattle at  Waterfront Station  in  Vancouver ,  British Columbia , and  Chicago ,  Illinois , that same year. At the time of its  initial public offering  on the stock market in 1992, Starbucks had grown to 165 outlets.    The first Starbucks location outside of North America opened in  Tokyo  in 1996. Starbucks entered the  U.K.  market in 1998 with the acquisition of the then 60-outlet, UK-based Seattle Coffee Company, re-branding all its stores as Starbucks. By November 2005,  London  had more outlets than  Manhattan , [ 10 ]  a sign of Starbucks becoming an international brand.          A Starbucks coffee shop in  Leeds ,  United Kingdom       In 1999, Starbucks experimented with eateries in the San Francisco Bay area through a restaurant chain called Circadia. [ 11 ]  These restaurants were soon ""outed"" as Starbucks establishments and converted to Starbucks cafes.   In April 2003, Starbucks completed the purchase of  Seattle's Best Coffee  and  Torrefazione Italia  from  AFC Enterprises , bringing the total number of Starbucks-operated locations worldwide to more than 6,400. On September 14, 2006, rival  Diedrich Coffee  announced that it would sell most of its company-owned retail stores to Starbucks. This sale includes the company-owned locations of the Oregon-based  Coffee People  chain. Starbucks has converted the Diedrich Coffee and Coffee People locations to Starbucks as of summer 2007, although the Portland airport Coffee People locations were excluded from the sale. [ 12 ] [ 13 ]   Starbucks' chairman,  Howard Schultz , has talked about making sure growth does not dilute the company's culture  [ 14 ]  and the common goal of the company's leadership to act like a small company.          The first Starbucks branch.       In January 2008, Chairman  Howard Schultz  resumed his roles as President and Chief Executive Officer after an eight year hiatus, and replaced Jim Donald, who took those posts in 2005 but decided to leave the company in late 2007. Schultz's principal challenge is to restore what he calls the ""distinctive Starbucks experience"" in the face of rapid expansion. Analysts believe that Schultz must determine how to contend with higher materials prices and enhanced competition from lower-price fast food chains, including  McDonald's  and  Dunkin' Donuts . On January 31, 2008, Schultz announced that Starbucks would discontinue its warm breakfast sandwich products, originally scheduled to launch nationwide in 2008, in order to refocus the brand on all things coffee. On February 23, Starbucks closed its stores from 5:30 p.m. to 9 p.m. local time to train its baristas. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]   As Starbucks often tests new products as part of its ongoing innovation and transformation, Starbucks started testing selling an 8 oz ""short"" brewed coffee for $1 and giving free refills on all brewed coffee. This test was limited to the greater Seattle market, with no plans for expansion to national markets. Per an internal email this program was cancelled in late March 2008.          A typical sales area, this one in  Peterborough ,  UK , showing a display of food and the beverage preparation area       In March 2008, Schultz made several announcements to Starbucks  shareholders . Shultz introduced Starbucks' ""state of the art espresso system"", [ 17 ]  the  Thermoplan AG  manufactured Mastrena, which replaced their previous superauto, the Thermoplan Verismo 801(known internationally as the Thermoplan Black & White). Starbucks also announced that the company hopes to enter the energy drink market and introduce a customer reward program. Pre-ground beans will also no longer be used, in order that the additional grinding of all whole bean coffee will ""bring aroma, romance and theater"" to American stores. [ 18 ]  The company also announced the recent acquisition of The Coffee Equipment Company, [ 17 ]  the manufacturer of the Clover Brewing System. They are currently test marketing this unique ""fresh-pressed"" coffee system at six Starbucks locations, three in Seattle, and three in Boston. [ 19 ]   In May 2008, a rewards program was initiated for registered users of the Starbucks Card. Previously simply a gift card, the Starbucks Card has undergone a transition into a rewards card, similar to cards offered by other retail outlets. Perks and rewards offered to registered users are 2 hours of free Wi-Fi Internet service per day, free refills of brewed coffee (some locations only honour this for the first 3 hours of your stay), a free tall beverage with the purchase of 1 lb. of whole bean coffee, as well as free milk (e.g. soy) and syrup drink modifiers. [ 20 ]  This is a new and aggressive approach by Starbucks to create and strengthen customer loyalty.   Tags displaying the title ""Master"" are worn by employees who have completed the Coffee Master course, which educates employees in not only the tasting, but also growing regions, roasting, and purchasing (including  fair trade  practices) aspects of the coffee industry. Almost 70% of the coffee used by Starbucks around the world comes from the sixth major producer in the world,  Guatemala , a pro-organic producer.   Starting in November of 2008 Starbucks began selling Product Red goods. According to the website because of this they have been able to provide AIDS medicine for 3,800 for an entire year. [ 21 ]     [ edit ]   Intellectual property   Starbucks U.S. Brands, LLC, is a Starbucks-owned company that currently holds and owns the property rights to approximately 120 Starbucks Coffee Company patents and trademarks. It is located at 2525 Starbucks Way in  Minden, Nevada . [ 22 ]     [ edit ]   Name   The company is named in part after  Starbuck ,  Captain Ahab 's  first mate  in the book  Moby-Dick , as well as a turn-of-the-century mining camp ( Starbo  or  Storbo ) on  Mount Rainier . According to  Howard Schultz 's book  Pour Your Heart Into It: How Starbucks Built a Company One Cup at a Time , the name of the company was derived from  Moby-Dick , although not in as direct a fashion as many assume. Gordon Bowker liked the name ""Pequod"" (the ship in the novel), but his then creative partner Terry Heckler responded, ""No one's going to drink a cup of Pee-quod!"" Heckler suggested ""Starbo"". Brainstorming with these two ideas resulted in the company being named for the  Pequod' s first mate, Starbuck.

[ 25 ]  The logo has been significantly streamlined over the years. In the first version, which gave the impression of an authentic 15th century European  woodcut , the Starbucks siren was topless and had a fully visible double fish tail. The image also had a rough visual texture. In the second version, which was used from 1987-92, her breasts were covered by her flowing hair, but her  navel  was still visible, and the fish tail was cropped slightly. In the current version, used since 1992, her navel and breasts are not visible at all, and only vestiges remain of the fish tails. The original ""woodcut"" logo can still be seen on the Starbucks store in Seattle's Pike Place Market, and on both the House Blend and Decaf House Blend packaging.   At the beginning of September 2006 and then again in early 2008, Starbucks temporarily reintroduced its original brown logo on paper hot drink cups. Starbucks has stated that this was done to show the company's heritage from the Pacific Northwest and to celebrate 35 years of business. The vintage logo sparked some controversy due in part to the siren's bare breasts, [ 26 ]  but the temporary switch garnered little attention from the media. Starbucks had drawn similar criticism when they reintroduced the vintage logo in 2006. [ 27 ]     [ edit ]   Parodies and infringements     [ edit ]   Environmental record          Starbucks inside  Tsutaya  in  Shibuya ,  Japan       In 1999, Starbucks started ""Grounds for your Garden"" to make their business more environment friendly. ""Grounds for your Garden"" is a year round program that gives leftover coffee grounds to anyone requesting it for composting. Although not all stores and regions participate, customers can request and rally their local Starbucks to begin the practice. In 2004, Starbucks began reducing the size of their paper napkins and store garbage bags, and lightening their solid waste production by 1.8 million pounds. [ 28 ] The U.S.  Food and Drug Administration  granted the first-ever approval to use recycled content in  food packaging  for Starbucks coffee cups. In 2005 Starbucks received the National Recycling Coalition Recycling Works Award. [ 29 ]  In 2008, Starbucks was ranked #15 on the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency 's list of Top 25 Green Power Partners for purchases of renewable energy. [ 30 ]   Starbucks has also received criticism from environmentalists. ""Dr. Allen Hershkowitz, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, says that Starbucks claimed they were using only 10 percent recycled material partly because the recycled material costs more."" [ 31 ]  In October 2008, The UK newspaper  The Sun  reported that Starbucks was wasting 23.4 million litres of water a day by leaving a tap constantly running for rinsing utensils in a ' dipper well ' in each of its stores worldwide.

Several Starbucks locations were vandalized during the  WTO   meeting held in Seattle in late 1999 .   The Starbucks location in the former imperial palace in Beijing closed in July 2007. The coffee shop had been a source of ongoing controversy since its opening in 2000 with protesters objecting that the presence of the American chain in this location ""was trampling on Chinese culture"". [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ]     [ edit ]   Anti-competitive tactics   Some of the methods Starbucks has used to expand and maintain their dominant market position include buying out competitors' leases, intentionally operating at a loss, and clustering several locations in a small geographical area (i.e., saturating the market), have been labeled anti-competitive by critics. [ 37 ]  For example, Starbucks fueled its initial expansion into the UK market with a buyout of Seattle Coffee Company, but then used its capital and influence to obtain prime locations, some of which operated at a financial loss. Critics claimed this was an unfair attempt to drive out small, independent competitors, who could not afford to pay inflated prices for premium real estate. [ 38 ]     [ edit ]   Labor disputes   Starbucks workers throughout seven different stores have joined the  Industrial Workers of the World  (IWW) as the  Starbucks Workers Union  since 2004. [ 39 ]          Starbucks in the  Financial District  of  Boston, Massachusetts       According to a Starbucks Union press release, since then, the union membership has begun expanding to Chicago and Maryland in addition to  New York City  where the movement originated. [ 40 ]  On March 7, 2006, the IWW and Starbucks agreed to a  National Labor Relations Board  settlement in which three Starbucks workers were granted almost US$2,000 in back wages and two fired employees were offered reinstatement. [ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ]  According to the Starbucks Union, on November 24, 2006, IWW members picketed Starbucks locations in more than 50 cities around the world in countries including Australia, Canada, Germany, and the UK, as well as U.S. cities including New York, Chicago, Minneapolis and San Francisco, [ 44 ]  to protest the firing of five Starbucks Workers Union organizers by Starbucks and to demand their reinstatement.   Some Starbucks baristas in Canada, [ 45 ]  Australia and New Zealand, [ 46 ]  and the United States [ 47 ]  belong to a variety of unions. In 2005, Starbucks paid out US$165,000 to eight employees at its Kent, Washington, roasting plant to settle charges that they had been retaliated against for being pro-union. At the time, the plant workers were represented by the  IUOE . Starbucks admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement. [ 39 ]          A Starbucks located in  Lima ,  Peru       A Starbucks strike occurred in  Auckland ,  New Zealand , on November 23, 2005. [ 46 ]  Organized by  Unite Union , workers sought secure hours, a  minimum wage  of NZ$12 an hour, and the abolition of youth rates. The company settled with the Union in 2006, resulting in pay increases, increased security of hours, and an improvement in youth rates. [ 48 ]   According to Starbucks Chairman Howard Schulz, ""If they had faith in me and my motives, they wouldn't need a union."" [ 49 ]  According to  The Seattle Times , ""The International Union of Operating Engineers Local 286 had trouble with Starbucks at its Kent roasting plant, where the union no longer represents workers"". [ 39 ]   In March 2008, Starbucks was ordered to pay  baristas  over  US$ 100 million in back tips in a  Californian   class action lawsuit  launched by baristas alleging that granting shift-supervisors a portion of  tips  violates state  labor laws . The Company plans to appeal. Similarly, an 18 year-old barista in Chestnut Hill, MA has just filed another suit with regards to the tipping policy. Massachusetts law also states that managers may not get a cut of tips.  [ 50 ] [ 51 ]  A similar lawsuit was also filed in Minnesota on March 27, 2008.  [ 52 ]     [ edit ]   Coffee bean market   In 2000, the company introduced a line of  fair trade  products. [ 53 ]   Of the approximately 136,000 tonnes (300 million pounds) of coffee Starbucks purchased in 2006, about 6 percent was certified as fair trade. [ 54 ]   According to Starbucks, they purchased 2,180 tonnes (4.8 million pounds) of Certified Fair Trade coffee in fiscal year 2004 and 5,220 tonnes (11.5 million pounds) in 2005. They have become the largest buyer of Certified Fair Trade coffee in North America (10% of the global market). Transfair USA, [ 55 ]  the only third-party certifier of Fair Trade Certified coffee in the United States, has noted the impact Starbucks has made in the area of Fair Trade and coffee farmer's lives by saying:       Since launching {its} FTC coffee line in 2000, Starbucks has undeniably made a significant contribution to family farmers through their rapidly growing FTC coffee volume. By offering FTC coffee in thousands of stores, Starbucks has also given the FTC label greater visibility, helping to raise consumer awareness in the process.       Groups such as  Global Exchange  are calling for Starbucks to further increase its sales of fair trade coffees. Fair trade certification can cost US$2,500 to US$10,000, based on the size of the producer group and length of time the inspections take, and many growers are unwilling or unable to pay for certification. [ 56 ]   Beyond Fair Trade Certification, Starbucks argues that it pays above market prices for all of its coffee. According to the company, in 2004 it paid on average $1.42 per pound ($2.64kg) for high-quality coffee beans. [ 57 ]  This is in comparison to commodity prices which were as low as $0.50$0.60 in 20032004. [ 58 ]     [ edit ]   Ethos water controversy          A Starbucks located in  Trujillo ,  Per       Ethos , a brand of bottled water acquired by Starbucks in 2005, is sold at locations throughout North America. Ethos bottles feature prominent labeling stating ""helping children get clean water"", referring to the fact that $.05 from each $1.80 bottle sold ($.10 per unit in Canada) is used to fund clean water projects in under-developed areas. Although sales of Ethos water have raised over $6,200,000 for clean water efforts, the brand is not a charity. Critics have argued that the claim on the label misleads consumers into thinking that Ethos is primarily a charitable organization, when it is actually a for-profit Starbucks brand and the vast majority of the sale price (97.2%) does not support clean-water projects. [ 59 ] [ 60 ]  The founders of Ethos have stated that the brand is intended to raise awareness of third-world clean water issues and provide socially responsible consumers with an opportunity to support the cause by choosing Ethos over other brands. [ 61 ]  Starbucks has since redesigned the American version of the Ethos water bottles, stating the amount of money donated per bottle in the description.     [ edit ]   Brighton store opens in breach of planning regulations   In May 2008, a branch of Starbucks was completed in  Kemptown  on St. James's Street,  Brighton, England , despite having being refused permission by the local planning authority, Brighton and Hove City Council. They claimed there were too many coffee shops already present on the street. [ 62 ] [ 63 ]  Starbucks has appealed the decision, with Brighton and Hove council monitoring the situation. [ 64 ]   Brighton & Hove City Council have served Starbucks with an enforcement notice (which they have appealed) to remove all tables and chairs from the premises in order to comply with planning regulations and operate as an A1 retail shop, rather than an A3 coffee shop/restaurant, for which they have no planning permission. The deadline of the enforcement is 20 February 2009. [ 65 ]     [ edit ]   Alleged relationship with the Israeli military   There have been calls for boycott of Starbucks stores and products because it is alleged that Starbucks sends part of its profits to the  Israeli military . [ 66 ]  It has been long alleged that Schultz is ""an active  Zionist ""  [ 67 ]  and is a recipient of several Israeli awards including ""The Israel 50th Anniversary Tribute Award"" for ""playing a key role in promoting a close alliance between the United States and Israel."" [ 68 ]  In response to these allegations Starbucks issued a statement saying Neither Chairman Howard Schultz nor Starbucks fund or support the Israeli Army. Starbucks is a non-political organization and does not support individual political causes. [ 69 ]  Starbucks has been a regular target of activists protesting against the  Israeli intervention in Gaza . Starbucks was forced to close a store in  Beirut ,  Lebanon  because of demonstrators shouting anti-Israel slogans and causing customers to flee. [ 70 ]  Protesters in Beirut told the  Associated Press  that they targeted Starbucks because they claim Chairman and CEO Howard Schultz donates money to the Israeli military. They hung several banners on the shop's window and used white tape to paste a  Star of David  over the green-and-white Starbucks sign. They also distributed a letter saying Schultz ""is one of the pillars of the American  Jewish lobby  and the owner of the Starbucks,"" which they said donates money to the Israeli military. [ 71 ]  Starbucks responded by saying ""Rumors that Starbucks Coffee Company and its management support Israel are unequivocally false. ... Starbucks is a nonpolitical organization and does not support political causes. Further, political preferences of a Starbucks partner [employee] at any level have absolutely no bearing on Starbucks company policies."" [ 72 ]     [ edit ]   Violence against Starbucks in the United Kingdom   On January 12, 2009, a Starbucks in Whitechapel Road in  London  was the target of vandalism by pro- Palestinian  demonstrators broke windows and reportedly ripped out fittings and equipment after clashes with riot police. Later the same day, after midnight, a suspected makeshift firebomb was hurled into the premises, causing further damage. [ 73 ] [ 74 ] [ 75 ]   On January 17, 2009, at an anti-Israel protest held by the  Stop the War Coalition  in  Trafalgar Square  in central  London , British Rapper  Lowkey  stated, with regard to Starbucks, that: ""You say you know about the Zionist lobby but you put money in their pockets every time youre buying their coffee."" After the rally, two groups of people, many wearing scarves over their faces, smashed and looted two Starbucks on Piccadilly and Shaftesbury Avenue. Although the Starbucks stores had requested greater police protection following the violence against a Starbucks the previous week,  Scotland Yard  stated it could ""not stop thugs hell-bent on causing damage."" [ 76 ] [ 74 ] [ 77 ] [ 78 ]     [ edit ]   Accusations by Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi   In a sermon delivered by Muslim cleric Sheikh  Yusuf al-Qaradawi , which aired on  Al Jazeera TV  on January 9, 2009 (as translated by MEMRI), Al-Qaradhawi accused Starbucks of supporting Israeli education and the Israeli Army and called for a boycott of the company and other western chains. [ 79 ]  Al-Qaradawi has previously called for a similar boycott of all US products with limited success. [ 80 ]  Starbucks has not commented directly on Al-Qaradawi's accusations, but has in the past, denied supporting Israel or any other political action. [ 73 ]     [ edit ]   Other ventures   Main article:  Hear Music   Starbucks entered the music industry in 1999 with the acquisition of Hear Music, and the film industry in 2006 with the creation of Starbucks Entertainment. Starbucks Entertainment was one of the producers of the 2006 film  Akeelah and the Bee . Retail stores heavily advertised the film before its release.   Hear Music is the brand name of Starbucks' retail music concept. Hear Music began as a catalog company in 1990 and was purchased by Starbucks in 1999. Nearly three years later, in 2002, they produced a Starbucks opera album, featuring artists such as  Luciano Pavarotti .     [ edit ]   Partnership with Apple   Starbucks has agreed to a partnership with  Apple  to collaborate on selling music as part of the coffeehouse experience. In October 2006, Apple added a Starbucks Entertainment area to the  iTunes Store , selling similar music that appeared in Starbucks stores. In September 2007 Apple announced that there would be wireless communication between Apple and Starbucks. Through the AT&T Wi-Fi, a paywall is opened up to allow any individual connecting to AT&T wifi access to the  iTunes Store  (regardless of whether he or she is an AT&T subscriber). The partnership is primarily targeted at  iPhone ,  iPod Touch , and  Macbook  users (although anyone with access to iTunes can take advantage of it). In addition, the iTunes Store will automatically detect the current and last 10 songs playing in a Starbucks and offer users connected to the store's wireless network the opportunity to download the tracks. This feature has been rolled out in  Seattle ,  New York City , and the  San Francisco Bay Area , and will slowly be offered in limited markets during 20072008. [ 81 ]  During the fall of 2007, Starbucks also began to sell digital downloads of certain albums through iTunes. The buyer would buy the download at Starbucks, and enter the code on the download card at the iTunes Store, and then the entire album would immediately start downloading. From October 2 to November 7, 2007, Starbucks gave away 37 different songs for free download through iTunes as part of the ""Song of the Day"" promotion. Each day, baristas would give out download cards for a particular song which could be redeemed on iTunes. Currently, every Tuesday, a new ""Pick of the Week"" download card is available at Starbucks for a free song download, similar to its previous ""Song of the Day.""

clueweb09-en0009-88-27895	                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Starbucks Latest Response to the Frankenbuck$ Campaign                 from <www.starbucks.com June 21, 2001                 Starbucks Organic Milk, GMO-free and Fair Trade Certified Coffee                  Commitments An Update for the Continental USA                 Starbucks is committed to sourcing and serving high quality coffee,                  tea, food and merchandise and to being environmentally and socially                  responsible.                 In March, Starbucks responded publicly to concerns raised by                  activist organizations and some of our customers regarding synthetic                  hormones in dairy herds, genetically modified organisms (GMO)                  in our products, and the purchasing and brewing of Fair Trade                  Certified coffee in our retail stores.                 Like most citizens and companies, Starbucks relies on regulatory                  agencies to determine what products are safe for human consumption.                  Starbucks products are in full compliance with all known laws                  and regulations. Although we are purveyors of the ultimate coffeehouse                  experience, we are not scientists and are not qualified to comment                  on the science of genetically modified organisms. Nevertheless,                  Starbucks has set a clear path for the Company to follow in these                  areas moving forward.                 Organic Milk Position: Starbucks is committed to providing an                  rBST-free (sometimes called rBGH-free) milk alternative in all                  company-owned stores in the U.S. by the end of summer 2001.                 Progress to Date An organic, rBST-free milk alternative has been                  tested in some stores and this alternative, along with the already                  available organic soy, will be available to customers interested                  in organic milk-based bar beverages in all company-owned stores                  in the U.S. by the end of July 2001.                 Starbucks is working with vendors to determine the feasibility                  of offering only rBST-free milk in all stores. What we now know                  is that there is a very limited supply of rBST-free milk and it                  is much more costly than existing supplies. We continue to work                  on resolving the supply issues and will evaluate the financial                  impact of offering rBST-free milk to our customers and the Company.                  We expect to make a final determination on supply and financial                  feasibility by the end of this year. Regardless, we will continue                  to make rBST-free milk available to U.S. customers upon request.                 Genetically Modified Organisms Position: Despite the lack of                  federally enforced labeling practices, Starbucks is committed                  to offering products without genetically manufactured organisms                  if they can be made available at a price acceptable to our customers.                 Progress to Date Starbucks has confirmed that its core products,                  coffee and tea, are not genetically modified. We have also completed                  a review of our other products and determined that the majority                  are GMO-free. Where we have identified the presence of genetically                  engineered ingredients, Starbucks is searching for, and evaluating,                  alternative sources of supply. Starbucks recently launched a test                  of baked goods prepared with organic ingredients in Seattle and                  Portland, Oregon, and will continue to monitor quality and customer                  interest.                 Fair Trade Certified Coffee Since October 2000, Starbucks has                  led the retail specialty coffee industry by offering Fair Trade                  Certified coffee in all of its company-owned U.S. stores. To become                  Fair Trade Certified, an importer must meet certain criteria such                  as paying a minimum price of $1.26 per pound of coffee to cooperatives                  registered with Fair Trade licensing organizations. Starbucks                  is committed to offering Fair Trade Certified whole bean coffee                  worldwide and to offering brewed Fair Trade coffee in all our                  stores on an ongoing basis.                 Progress to Date It is a monumental challenge to source and serve                  brewed and whole bean Fair Trade Certified coffee that meets our                  rigorous taste and quality standards at our more than 2,400 company-owned                  stores in the U.S. Achieving this goal requires an unwavering                  commitment not only from Starbucks partners (employees), but also                  from our customers, Fair Trade certifying agencies, international                  coffee brokers and the farmers who grow the coffee in the origin                  countries.                 Despite the challenges, Starbucks is committed to significantly                  develop the Fair Trade Certified coffee program in our company-owned                  stores in the U.S., college and universities in the U.S. and in                  the international markets where Starbucks does business.                 From April 25-May 29, 2001, Fair Trade coffee was featured as                  Starbucks whole bean promotional choice and on May 18, Fair Trade                  coffee was brewed as Coffee of the Day in all company-owned stores                  in the U.S. The feedback we received from Starbucks customers                  and partners was favorable. Since January 2001, weekly sales of                  Starbucks Fair Trade Certified whole bean coffee have more than                  doubled.                 At Starbucks, our partners (employees) and corporate responsibility                  partners are committed to continuing to lead the way in coffeehouse                  innovation, quality, and environmental and social responsibility.                  We are proud of our accomplishments and recognize that there is                  still much to do.

""The aim is to unite everything        in a Corporate Religion."" ~~ Howard Schultz, Starbucks Coffee.         culturejam :        An  internet         hoax costs Starbucks an unspecified amount of money in July when counterfeit        coupons are circulated by email, offering a free twelve-ounce Creme Frappuccino.        In the three hours it takes for Starbucks to discover the fraud and contact        their locations, most locations have completely run out of the Frappuccino        stock.           Starbuck, a Canadian bull who sired 200,000 dairy      cows and equal number of bulls in his life, earned an estimated $25 million      before he died in 1998.  After his death, his frozen semen was still      selling for $250 a dose.

If you say yes, that means you are more likely to go to Starbucks, which is one of the most important stores that serve coffee in the United State. Because many people in the United State like to drink coffee, our group Henry, Faisal, Ahmed, Juanita, and I decided to find out what most people think and feel about Starbucks and why they choose Starbucks. So we asked forty- two people and we found out that 83% like to drink coffee in the United States. 90% like to go to Starbucks. 47% say that Starbucks serves a good coffee’s quality. generally we found many people who like to drink coffee in Starbucks, and many people have a positive feeling about Starbucks. Before I did my survey I thought that I would find many people who do not like Starbucks, because of the high prices and other reasons like the environment, but I found that many people like it. Actually, I found one man who really hates Starbucks and when I asked him to do the survey he said I hate Starbucks and I could not get more information from him because he was really angry about Starbucks. In gournal I found many people who like Starbucks, and many people like the coffee’s quality.

I read an article, which talks about  starbucks . This article discusses the environmentalists’ opinions abut star bucks. It sows what the environmentalists think and feel about the star bucks work. It shows that many environmentalists’ agents their work. They think that star bucks do not tread its worker very well, so they usually have a very low salary. Also, they think sturbucks usually use un organic stuff on their work. Starbucks are a very famous store in many different countries. Many people especially in United State like its coffee. Actually, I surprised when I read what the environmentalists said about starbuck. I extremely agree with their opinion. Starbucks should tread its worker very well. In addition, starbucks should use an organic stuff on their drinks. so, the environmentalists’ opinions are very important, and I hope starbucks fallow their opinion.

It had ten questions for students in SIU. When I asked some students they smiled and I asked them why? They said, “It is really a good topic to talk about, and we like to talk about this kind of business, because it is a successful business”. I met with someone who works in Starbucks and he was satisfied about service and salary. We found 83% of students drink coffee and 90% of students always go to Starbucks. Also, we got 60% of students who drink one cup a day, 29% of students who drink one to two cups a day, 7% of students who drink three to four cups a day, 2% of students drink who coffee five to six a day, and 2% of students drink more then six cups a day. The result told us many students like to drink coffee from Starbucks, and there are two reasons for that. First of all, it has high quality coffee. Second, it is popular. In my opinion, Starbucks is a successful idea of business, and now everyone likes to drink coffee, but some of them do not have time to make coffee. Also, Starbucks encourages me and people to buy coffee, because it has a good quality and we can find the store anywhere. However, many people are not satisfied with its price, because I think it is expensive, especially for students. Finally, I made plan for my future to start a business like Starbucks, and I will provide good quality with low price.

Why StarBucks can be so popular and successful. Faisal, Abdulmajeed,  Ahmed,  Juanita and I, we all interested in this subject. We make a survey for our project. Each one of our group member needs to get 8 people for this survey. We want to know how people think about StarBucks. When we finish our survey and count the result. I use the computer software to support me to create graph of our survey result. That can help us to know what happened. We found out people really like it. People think they provide coffee with good taste and quality. Over 90 percent of people have ever been to StarBucks. That means they really did a good job. They really caught their customer’s heart. This is the first survey I have done in American college. Every Thursday I have a conversation table at Ambassador Hall. So I ask some of my American friends to help me to fill out this survey. I also went to StarBucks that locate at student center. I found couple people who sit in the StarBucks and study to help me fill out the survey. They are very friendly and very happy to help me. This is a really good experience. The result does not surprise me, because just as I think, most people think they provide good coffee and environment to let you relax. But one interesting thing is mort people are confused at the question which is the StarBucks and environment problem. It’s really hard to think coffee and environment. This is a really interesting survey and let me know more things about StarBucks. I am really enjoying it.

There are a lot of opinions came from people who said Starbucks has high quality coffee.  Also, we can find food inside it such as sandwiches and desserts.

What is there to love? The pay, for one; a Starbucks  barista  typically earns more than her other retail counterparts, not including the tips. Then, there are the generous employment benefits, including health care coverage, stock options, retirement savings plans, and child support. And generally, with all the free coffee you can drink and current music playing in the stores, shifts pass by relatively quickly.     Despite being ranked the second best company to work for by Fortune magazine in 2005, not everybody enjoys their time working as a Starbucks  barista.  That includes one Matthew Brown, who worked for the company for over six years. A 28-year-old Starbucks  barista  based in Toronto, Brown kept a regular blog about his experiences working for the company. It was this online journal that would eventually get the Starbucks  barista  into hot water and leave him without a job.     It was on his blog that Brown would vent his frustrations of life as a Starbucks  barista.  He would complain about everything from his boss who once wouldn let him go home when he was sick to having to deal with rude and condescending customers. Although he never used his real name nor that of his manager, and he only gave the website address to a select group of people, Starbucks somehow got its hands on it. On the day the Starbucks  barista  was supposed to begin management training, having been promoted from a Starbucks  barista  to a supervisor, he was fired.     here are times when youe frustrated, some people have treated you terribly that day, so you vent just like in any job,said the Starbucks  barista.  t was ignorant and rude, but it was for nobody except my family and friends.Although Brown, along with every other Starbucks  barista,  signed a contract whereby he agreed not to make any negative comments about the company, he argues that his blog was a private means of communicating a very private message. In that, he sees no harm.     Brown case is not the first of its kind. There have been numerous other cases of Starbucks  baristas  who have been reprimanded for similar pursuits posting websites that Starbucks feels are defamatory. So, the question is, if Starbucks is such a great place to work, why is there more than one Starbucks  barista  turning to the Internet to voice their frustrations?    Working as a Starbucks  barista  means working in a high-stress environment. When customers come into the store, they want their coffee, they want it done right, and they want it right away. In caffeine-deprived situations, there is neither hardly any tolerance nor any room for mistakes. As a Starbucks  barista,  you are not just serving coffee; you are ensuring that your customers get their day off on the right start. Despite all the advances of mankind, it is surprising how incapable people are of functioning before that first cup of coffee.     For the Starbucks  barista,  the caution sign on their cups of coffee has an entirely different meaning: become one at your own risk.

Starbucks is the largest  coffeehouse  company in the world, [ 2 ]  with 16,120 stores in 44 countries. [ 3 ]  Starbucks sells  drip brewed coffee ,  espresso -based hot drinks, other hot and cold drinks, snacks, and items such as mugs and coffee beans. Through the Starbucks Entertainment division and  Hear Music  brand, the company also markets books, music, and film. Many of the company's products are seasonal or specific to the locality of the store. Starbucks-brand ice cream and coffee are also sold at grocery stores.   From Starbucks' founding in Seattle as a local  coffee bean  roaster and retailer, the company has expanded rapidly. In the 1990s, Starbucks was opening a new store every workday, a pace that continued into the 2000s. Domestic growth has since slowed, although the company continues to expand in foreign markets and will open a net of 900 new stores outside of the U.S. in 2009. [ 4 ]  The first location outside of the United States and Canada was established in 1990s, and they now constitute almost one third of Starbucks' stores. [ 5 ]   As of early 2009, Starbucks has more than 16,000 stores in 58 countries worldwide, 11,006 of which are located in the United States, followed by Canada with 976 and Japan with 845 locations. On July 1, 2008, the company announced it was closing 600 under-performing company-owned stores and cutting U.S. expansion plans amid growing economic uncertainty. [ 6 ] [ 7 ]  On July 29, 2008, Starbucks also cut almost 1,000 non-retail jobs as part of its bid to re-energize the brand and boost its profit. Of the new cuts, 550 of the positions are layoffs and the rest are unfilled jobs. [ 8 ]  These closings and layoffs have effectively ended the companys period of growth and expansion that began in the mid-1990s.   On January 28, 2009, Starbucks announced the closure of an additional 300 under-performing stores, and the elimination of 7,000 positions. CEO Howard Schultz also announced that he had received board approval to reduce his salary.

Located in the old Sears, Roebuck and Co. catalog distribution center building.       The original Starbucks was opened in Pike Place Market in Seattle, Washington, in 1971 by three partners: English teacher  Jerry Baldwin , history teacher  Zev Siegel , and writer  Gordon Bowker . The three were inspired by  Alfred Peet , whom they knew personally, to open their first store in  Pike Place Market  to sell high-quality coffee beans and equipment. The original Starbucks location was at 2000 Western Avenue from 19711976. That store then moved to 1912 Pike Place; it is still open. During their first year of operation, they purchased green  coffee beans  from  Peet's , then began buying directly from growers.   Entrepreneur  Howard Schultz  joined the company in 1982, and, after a trip to  Milan, Italy , advised that the company should sell coffee and  espresso  drinks as well as beans. The owners rejected this idea, believing that getting into the beverage business would distract the company from its primary focus. To them,  coffee  was something to be prepared in the home. Certain that there was much money to be made selling drinks to on-the-go Americans, Schultz started the  Il Giornale  coffee bar chain in 1985.   In 1984, the original owners of Starbucks, led by Baldwin, took the opportunity to purchase Peet's (Baldwin still works there today). In 1987, they sold the Starbucks chain to Schultz's Il Giornale, which rebranded the Il Giornale outlets as Starbucks and quickly began to expand. Starbucks opened its first locations outside Seattle at  Waterfront Station  in  Vancouver ,  British Columbia , and  Chicago ,  Illinois , that same year. At the time of its  initial public offering  on the stock market in 1992, Starbucks had grown to 165 outlets.    The first Starbucks location outside of North America opened in  Tokyo  in 1996. Starbucks entered the  U.K.  market in 1998 with the acquisition of the then 60-outlet, UK-based Seattle Coffee Company, re-branding all its stores as Starbucks. By November 2005,  London  had more outlets than  Manhattan , [ 10 ]  a sign of Starbucks becoming an international brand.          A Starbucks coffee shop in  Leeds ,  United Kingdom       In 1999, Starbucks experimented with eateries in the San Francisco Bay area through a restaurant chain called Circadia. [ 11 ]  These restaurants were soon ""outed"" as Starbucks establishments and converted to Starbucks cafes.   In April 2003, Starbucks completed the purchase of  Seattle's Best Coffee  and  Torrefazione Italia  from  AFC Enterprises , bringing the total number of Starbucks-operated locations worldwide to more than 6,400. On September 14, 2006, rival  Diedrich Coffee  announced that it would sell most of its company-owned retail stores to Starbucks. This sale includes the company-owned locations of the Oregon-based  Coffee People  chain. Starbucks has converted the Diedrich Coffee and Coffee People locations to Starbucks as of summer 2007, although the Portland airport Coffee People locations were excluded from the sale. [ 12 ] [ 13 ]   Starbucks' chairman,  Howard Schultz , has talked about making sure growth does not dilute the company's culture  [ 14 ]  and the common goal of the company's leadership to act like a small company.          The first Starbucks branch.       In January 2008, Chairman  Howard Schultz  resumed his roles as President and Chief Executive Officer after an eight year hiatus, and replaced Jim Donald, who took those posts in 2005 but decided to leave the company in late 2007. Schultz's principal challenge is to restore what he calls the ""distinctive Starbucks experience"" in the face of rapid expansion. Analysts believe that Schultz must determine how to contend with higher materials prices and enhanced competition from lower-price fast food chains, including  McDonald's  and  Dunkin' Donuts . On January 31, 2008, Schultz announced that Starbucks would discontinue its warm breakfast sandwich products, originally scheduled to launch nationwide in 2008, in order to refocus the brand on all things coffee. On February 23, Starbucks closed its stores from 5:30 p.m. to 9 p.m. local time to train its baristas. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]   As Starbucks often tests new products as part of its ongoing innovation and transformation, Starbucks started testing selling an 8 oz ""short"" brewed coffee for $1 and giving free refills on all brewed coffee. This test was limited to the greater Seattle market, with no plans for expansion to national markets. Per an internal email this program was cancelled in late March 2008.          A typical sales area, this one in  Peterborough ,  UK , showing a display of food and the beverage preparation area       In March 2008, Schultz made several announcements to Starbucks  shareholders . Shultz introduced Starbucks' ""state of the art espresso system"", [ 17 ]  the  Thermoplan AG  manufactured Mastrena, which replaced their previous superauto, the Thermoplan Verismo 801(known internationally as the Thermoplan Black & White). Starbucks also announced that the company hopes to enter the energy drink market and introduce a customer reward program. Pre-ground beans will also no longer be used, in order that the additional grinding of all whole bean coffee will ""bring aroma, romance and theater"" to American stores. [ 18 ]  The company also announced the recent acquisition of The Coffee Equipment Company, [ 17 ]  the manufacturer of the Clover Brewing System. They are currently test marketing this unique ""fresh-pressed"" coffee system at six Starbucks locations, three in Seattle, and three in Boston. [ 19 ]   In May 2008, a rewards program was initiated for registered users of the Starbucks Card. Previously simply a gift card, the Starbucks Card has undergone a transition into a rewards card, similar to cards offered by other retail outlets. Perks and rewards offered to registered users are 2 hours of free Wi-Fi Internet service per day, free refills of brewed coffee (some locations only honour this for the first 3 hours of your stay), a free tall beverage with the purchase of 1 lb. of whole bean coffee, as well as free milk (e.g. soy) and syrup drink modifiers. [ 20 ]  This is a new and aggressive approach by Starbucks to create and strengthen customer loyalty.   Tags displaying the title ""Master"" are worn by employees who have completed the Coffee Master course, which educates employees in not only the tasting, but also growing regions, roasting, and purchasing (including  fair trade  practices) aspects of the coffee industry. Almost 70% of the coffee used by Starbucks around the world comes from the sixth major producer in the world,  Guatemala , a pro-organic producer.   Starting in November of 2008 Starbucks began selling Product Red goods. According to the website because of this they have been able to provide AIDS medicine for 3,800 for an entire year. [ 21 ]     [ edit ]   Intellectual property   Starbucks U.S. Brands, LLC, is a Starbucks-owned company that currently holds and owns the property rights to approximately 120 Starbucks Coffee Company patents and trademarks. It is located at 2525 Starbucks Way in  Minden, Nevada . [ 22 ]     [ edit ]   Name   The company is named in part after  Starbuck ,  Captain Ahab 's  first mate  in the book  Moby-Dick , as well as a turn-of-the-century mining camp ( Starbo  or  Storbo ) on  Mount Rainier . According to  Howard Schultz 's book  Pour Your Heart Into It: How Starbucks Built a Company One Cup at a Time , the name of the company was derived from  Moby-Dick , although not in as direct a fashion as many assume. Gordon Bowker liked the name ""Pequod"" (the ship in the novel), but his then creative partner Terry Heckler responded, ""No one's going to drink a cup of Pee-quod!"" Heckler suggested ""Starbo"". Brainstorming with these two ideas resulted in the company being named for the  Pequod' s first mate, Starbuck. [ 23 ]          A Starbucks location in the  insa-dong  district of  Seoul ,  South Korea . This particular location is a rarity in that the main sign is not written in  English .       International names include:     Arabic -speaking countries:  (transliteration:  strbaks )   Bulgaria :  (transliteration:  Starbks )   China ,  Hong Kong ,  Macau ,  Taiwan :   Pinyin : xngbk ( xng means ""star"", while  is a  transliteration  of ""-bucks"")   Israel :  (transliteration:  srbaqs )   Japan :  (transliteration:  sutbakkusu , phonological:  staa-bahkss )   Russia :  (transliteration:  Starbaks )   South Korea :  (transliteration:  seutabeokseu ), often used in conjunction with the English name   Quebec ,  Canada : Caf Starbucks Coffee [ 24 ]   Thailand :  pronounced  [satbk]       [ edit ]   Logo          Original brown logo              ""Abraxas"" - Louvre       Valerie O'Neil, a Starbucks spokeswoman, said that the logo is an image of a ""twin-tailed siren"" (the  siren  of  Greek mythology ). [ 25 ]  The logo has been significantly streamlined over the years. In the first version, which gave the impression of an authentic 15th century European  woodcut , the Starbucks siren was topless and had a fully visible double fish tail. The image also had a rough visual texture. In the second version, which was used from 1987-92, her breasts were covered by her flowing hair, but her  navel  was still visible, and the fish tail was cropped slightly. In the current version, used since 1992, her navel and breasts are not visible at all, and only vestiges remain of the fish tails. The original ""woodcut"" logo can still be seen on the Starbucks store in Seattle's Pike Place Market, and on both the House Blend and Decaf House Blend packaging.   At the beginning of September 2006 and then again in early 2008, Starbucks temporarily reintroduced its original brown logo on paper hot drink cups. Starbucks has stated that this was done to show the company's heritage from the Pacific Northwest and to celebrate 35 years of business. The vintage logo sparked some controversy due in part to the siren's bare breasts, [ 26 ]  but the temporary switch garnered little attention from the media. Starbucks had drawn similar criticism when they reintroduced the vintage logo in 2006. [ 27 ]     [ edit ]   Parodies and infringements     [ edit ]   Environmental record          Starbucks inside  Tsutaya  in  Shibuya ,  Japan       In 1999, Starbucks started ""Grounds for your Garden"" to make their business more environment friendly. ""Grounds for your Garden"" is a year round program that gives leftover coffee grounds to anyone requesting it for composting. Although not all stores and regions participate, customers can request and rally their local Starbucks to begin the practice. In 2004, Starbucks began reducing the size of their paper napkins and store garbage bags, and lightening their solid waste production by 1.8 million pounds. [ 28 ] The U.S.  Food and Drug Administration  granted the first-ever approval to use recycled content in  food packaging  for Starbucks coffee cups. In 2005 Starbucks received the National Recycling Coalition Recycling Works Award. [ 29 ]  In 2008, Starbucks was ranked #15 on the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency 's list of Top 25 Green Power Partners for purchases of renewable energy. [ 30 ]   Starbucks has also received criticism from environmentalists. ""Dr. Allen Hershkowitz, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, says that Starbucks claimed they were using only 10 percent recycled material partly because the recycled material costs more."" [ 31 ]  In October 2008, The UK newspaper  The Sun  reported that Starbucks was wasting 23.4 million litres of water a day by leaving a tap constantly running for rinsing utensils in a ' dipper well ' in each of its stores worldwide. [ 32 ]   Does anyone know other environmental impact stats for Starbucks annually-- Asiachai  ( talk ) 17:30, 16 March 2009 (UTC)     [ edit ]   Criticism and controversy          Starbucks at the  Forbidden City  in  Beijing  (closed since July 2007)       Several activist groups maintain websites criticizing the company's  fair-trade  policies, labor relations, and environmental impact, and hold it as a prime example of U.S. cultural and economic  imperialism . Several Starbucks locations were vandalized during the  WTO   meeting held in Seattle in late 1999 .   The Starbucks location in the former imperial palace in Beijing closed in July 2007. The coffee shop had been a source of ongoing controversy since its opening in 2000 with protesters objecting that the presence of the American chain in this location ""was trampling on Chinese culture"". [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ]     [ edit ]   Anti-competitive tactics   Some of the methods Starbucks has used to expand and maintain their dominant market position include buying out competitors' leases, intentionally operating at a loss, and clustering several locations in a small geographical area (i.e., saturating the market), have been labeled anti-competitive by critics. [ 37 ]  For example, Starbucks fueled its initial expansion into the UK market with a buyout of Seattle Coffee Company, but then used its capital and influence to obtain prime locations, some of which operated at a financial loss. Critics claimed this was an unfair attempt to drive out small, independent competitors, who could not afford to pay inflated prices for premium real estate. [ 38 ]     [ edit ]   Labor disputes   Starbucks workers throughout seven different stores have joined the  Industrial Workers of the World  (IWW) as the  Starbucks Workers Union  since 2004. [ 39 ]          Starbucks in the  Financial District  of  Boston, Massachusetts       According to a Starbucks Union press release, since then, the union membership has begun expanding to Chicago and Maryland in addition to  New York City  where the movement originated. [ 40 ]  On March 7, 2006, the IWW and Starbucks agreed to a  National Labor Relations Board  settlement in which three Starbucks workers were granted almost US$2,000 in back wages and two fired employees were offered reinstatement. [ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ]  According to the Starbucks Union, on November 24, 2006, IWW members picketed Starbucks locations in more than 50 cities around the world in countries including Australia, Canada, Germany, and the UK, as well as U.S. cities including New York, Chicago, Minneapolis and San Francisco, [ 44 ]  to protest the firing of five Starbucks Workers Union organizers by Starbucks and to demand their reinstatement.   Some Starbucks baristas in Canada, [ 45 ]  Australia and New Zealand, [ 46 ]  and the United States [ 47 ]  belong to a variety of unions. In 2005, Starbucks paid out US$165,000 to eight employees at its Kent, Washington, roasting plant to settle charges that they had been retaliated against for being pro-union. At the time, the plant workers were represented by the  IUOE . Starbucks admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement. [ 39 ]          A Starbucks located in  Lima ,  Peru       A Starbucks strike occurred in  Auckland ,  New Zealand , on November 23, 2005. [ 46 ]  Organized by  Unite Union , workers sought secure hours, a  minimum wage  of NZ$12 an hour, and the abolition of youth rates. The company settled with the Union in 2006, resulting in pay increases, increased security of hours, and an improvement in youth rates. [ 48 ]   According to Starbucks Chairman Howard Schulz, ""If they had faith in me and my motives, they wouldn't need a union."" [ 49 ]  According to  The Seattle Times , ""The International Union of Operating Engineers Local 286 had trouble with Starbucks at its Kent roasting plant, where the union no longer represents workers"". [ 39 ]   In March 2008, Starbucks was ordered to pay  baristas  over  US$ 100 million in back tips in a  Californian   class action lawsuit  launched by baristas alleging that granting shift-supervisors a portion of  tips  violates state  labor laws . The Company plans to appeal. Similarly, an 18 year-old barista in Chestnut Hill, MA has just filed another suit with regards to the tipping policy. Massachusetts law also states that managers may not get a cut of tips.  [ 50 ] [ 51 ]  A similar lawsuit was also filed in Minnesota on March 27, 2008.  [ 52 ]     [ edit ]   Coffee bean market   In 2000, the company introduced a line of  fair trade  products. [ 53 ]   Of the approximately 136,000 tonnes (300 million pounds) of coffee Starbucks purchased in 2006, about 6 percent was certified as fair trade. [ 54 ]   According to Starbucks, they purchased 2,180 tonnes (4.8 million pounds) of Certified Fair Trade coffee in fiscal year 2004 and 5,220 tonnes (11.5 million pounds) in 2005. They have become the largest buyer of Certified Fair Trade coffee in North America (10% of the global market). Transfair USA, [ 55 ]  the only third-party certifier of Fair Trade Certified coffee in the United States, has noted the impact Starbucks has made in the area of Fair Trade and coffee farmer's lives by saying:       Since launching {its} FTC coffee line in 2000, Starbucks has undeniably made a significant contribution to family farmers through their rapidly growing FTC coffee volume. By offering FTC coffee in thousands of stores, Starbucks has also given the FTC label greater visibility, helping to raise consumer awareness in the process.       Groups such as  Global Exchange  are calling for Starbucks to further increase its sales of fair trade coffees. Fair trade certification can cost US$2,500 to US$10,000, based on the size of the producer group and length of time the inspections take, and many growers are unwilling or unable to pay for certification. [ 56 ]   Beyond Fair Trade Certification, Starbucks argues that it pays above market prices for all of its coffee. According to the company, in 2004 it paid on average $1.42 per pound ($2.64kg) for high-quality coffee beans. [ 57 ]  This is in comparison to commodity prices which were as low as $0.50$0.60 in 20032004. [ 58 ]     [ edit ]   Ethos water controversy          A Starbucks located in  Trujillo ,  Per       Ethos , a brand of bottled water acquired by Starbucks in 2005, is sold at locations throughout North America. Ethos bottles feature prominent labeling stating ""helping children get clean water"", referring to the fact that $.05 from each $1.80 bottle sold ($.10 per unit in Canada) is used to fund clean water projects in under-developed areas. Although sales of Ethos water have raised over $6,200,000 for clean water efforts, the brand is not a charity. Critics have argued that the claim on the label misleads consumers into thinking that Ethos is primarily a charitable organization, when it is actually a for-profit Starbucks brand and the vast majority of the sale price (97.2%) does not support clean-water projects. [ 59 ] [ 60 ]  The founders of Ethos have stated that the brand is intended to raise awareness of third-world clean water issues and provide socially responsible consumers with an opportunity to support the cause by choosing Ethos over other brands. [ 61 ]  Starbucks has since redesigned the American version of the Ethos water bottles, stating the amount of money donated per bottle in the description.     [ edit ]   Brighton store opens in breach of planning regulations   In May 2008, a branch of Starbucks was completed in  Kemptown  on St. James's Street,  Brighton, England , despite having being refused permission by the local planning authority, Brighton and Hove City Council. They claimed there were too many coffee shops already present on the street. [ 62 ] [ 63 ]  Starbucks has appealed the decision, with Brighton and Hove council monitoring the situation. [ 64 ]   Brighton & Hove City Council have served Starbucks with an enforcement notice (which they have appealed) to remove all tables and chairs from the premises in order to comply with planning regulations and operate as an A1 retail shop, rather than an A3 coffee shop/restaurant, for which they have no planning permission. The deadline of the enforcement is 20 February 2009. [ 65 ]     [ edit ]   Alleged relationship with the Israeli military   There have been calls for boycott of Starbucks stores and products because it is alleged that Starbucks sends part of its profits to the  Israeli military . [ 66 ]  It has been long alleged that Schultz is ""an active  Zionist ""  [ 67 ]  and is a recipient of several Israeli awards including ""The Israel 50th Anniversary Tribute Award"" for ""playing a key role in promoting a close alliance between the United States and Israel."" [ 68 ]  In response to these allegations Starbucks issued a statement saying Neither Chairman Howard Schultz nor Starbucks fund or support the Israeli Army. Starbucks is a non-political organization and does not support individual political causes. [ 69 ]  Starbucks has been a regular target of activists protesting against the  Israeli intervention in Gaza . Starbucks was forced to close a store in  Beirut ,  Lebanon  because of demonstrators shouting anti-Israel slogans and causing customers to flee. [ 70 ]  Protesters in Beirut told the  Associated Press  that they targeted Starbucks because they claim Chairman and CEO Howard Schultz donates money to the Israeli military. They hung several banners on the shop's window and used white tape to paste a  Star of David  over the green-and-white Starbucks sign. They also distributed a letter saying Schultz ""is one of the pillars of the American  Jewish lobby  and the owner of the Starbucks,"" which they said donates money to the Israeli military. [ 71 ]  Starbucks responded by saying ""Rumors that Starbucks Coffee Company and its management support Israel are unequivocally false. ... Starbucks is a nonpolitical organization and does not support political causes. Further, political preferences of a Starbucks partner [employee] at any level have absolutely no bearing on Starbucks company policies."" [ 72 ]     [ edit ]   Violence against Starbucks in the United Kingdom   On January 12, 2009, a Starbucks in Whitechapel Road in  London  was the target of vandalism by pro- Palestinian  demonstrators broke windows and reportedly ripped out fittings and equipment after clashes with riot police. Later the same day, after midnight, a suspected makeshift firebomb was hurled into the premises, causing further damage. [ 73 ] [ 74 ] [ 75 ]   On January 17, 2009, at an anti-Israel protest held by the  Stop the War Coalition  in  Trafalgar Square  in central  London , British Rapper  Lowkey  stated, with regard to Starbucks, that: ""You say you know about the Zionist lobby but you put money in their pockets every time youre buying their coffee."" After the rally, two groups of people, many wearing scarves over their faces, smashed and looted two Starbucks on Piccadilly and Shaftesbury Avenue. Although the Starbucks stores had requested greater police protection following the violence against a Starbucks the previous week,  Scotland Yard  stated it could ""not stop thugs hell-bent on causing damage."" [ 76 ] [ 74 ] [ 77 ] [ 78 ]     [ edit ]   Accusations by Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi   In a sermon delivered by Muslim cleric Sheikh  Yusuf al-Qaradawi , which aired on  Al Jazeera TV  on January 9, 2009 (as translated by MEMRI), Al-Qaradhawi accused Starbucks of supporting Israeli education and the Israeli Army and called for a boycott of the company and other western chains. [ 79 ]  Al-Qaradawi has previously called for a similar boycott of all US products with limited success. [ 80 ]  Starbucks has not commented directly on Al-Qaradawi's accusations, but has in the past, denied supporting Israel or any other political action. [ 73 ]     [ edit ]   Other ventures   Main article:  Hear Music   Starbucks entered the music industry in 1999 with the acquisition of Hear Music, and the film industry in 2006 with the creation of Starbucks Entertainment. Starbucks Entertainment was one of the producers of the 2006 film  Akeelah and the Bee . Retail stores heavily advertised the film before its release.   Hear Music is the brand name of Starbucks' retail music concept. Hear Music began as a catalog company in 1990 and was purchased by Starbucks in 1999. Nearly three years later, in 2002, they produced a Starbucks opera album, featuring artists such as  Luciano Pavarotti .     [ edit ]   Partnership with Apple   Starbucks has agreed to a partnership with  Apple  to collaborate on selling music as part of the coffeehouse experience. In October 2006, Apple added a Starbucks Entertainment area to the  iTunes Store , selling similar music that appeared in Starbucks stores. In September 2007 Apple announced that there would be wireless communication between Apple and Starbucks. Through the AT&T Wi-Fi, a paywall is opened up to allow any individual connecting to AT&T wifi access to the  iTunes Store  (regardless of whether he or she is an AT&T subscriber). The partnership is primarily targeted at  iPhone ,  iPod Touch , and  Macbook  users (although anyone with access to iTunes can take advantage of it). In addition, the iTunes Store will automatically detect the current and last 10 songs playing in a Starbucks and offer users connected to the store's wireless network the opportunity to download the tracks. This feature has been rolled out in  Seattle ,  New York City , and the  San Francisco Bay Area , and will slowly be offered in limited markets during 20072008. [ 81 ]  During the fall of 2007, Starbucks also began to sell digital downloads of certain albums through iTunes. The buyer would buy the download at Starbucks, and enter the code on the download card at the iTunes Store, and then the entire album would immediately start downloading. From October 2 to November 7, 2007, Starbucks gave away 37 different songs for free download through iTunes as part of the ""Song of the Day"" promotion. Each day, baristas would give out download cards for a particular song which could be redeemed on iTunes. Currently, every Tuesday, a new ""Pick of the Week"" download card is available at Starbucks for a free song download, similar to its previous ""Song of the Day.""

Once you know what to look for when  tasting,  you’ll be able to distinguish the subtle differences in aroma, body, flavour and acidity that make each coffee unique.  And to get you started, Starbucks has categorised its coffees according to a spectrum of profiles: mild, smooth and bold.                                                                                          Mild Coffees   With lighter bodies and gentle tastes, these make the perfect introduction to Starbucks® coffee.          Arabia  Mocha Java  Africa Kitamu Breakfast Blend Colombia Nariño Supremo House Blend                           Smooth Coffees   For a richer, deeper coffee experience, look for one of these the next time you’re in our store.

The precocious kid from                  Brooklyn is now overlord of a worldwide business empire that has                  turned into a true cultural phenomenon: the chain-style coffee                  shop where no latte is too grande.                 Starbucks has more than 4,000 branches worldwide, with an average                  of three more opening every day. About 2,700 outlets are in the                  United States and more than 100 in the United Kingdom. There are                  even plans to bring Starbucks to Italy. Ever since he talked his                  way into the management of Starbucks in 1982 (then a bean-selling                  operation in Seattle), turned it into a retail outfit and eventually                  bought the whole enterprise, he has been driven by an almost missionary                  zeal to bring his version of the Italian coffee experience to                  a worldwide audience.                 The corporate culture at Starbucks is, like Schultz, easy-going                  and concerned with a sense of community. Staff are well paid and                  enjoy generous benefit packages. However, there has been criticism                  by anti-globalisation protesters of Starbucks' coffee-buying practices                  and identikit outlets. Schultz's response has been typical: hurt                  indignation and an anxiety to make amends. Starbucks now sells                  Fair Trade Certified beans in 2,300 of its outlets (but does not                  yet use them in the coffee it brews for its customers). Schultz                  has just bought himself a $200m (£140m) controlling stake in the                  Seattle SuperSonics basketball team.                 The coffee grower: Tatu Museyni                 Cahal Milmo 17 May 2001                 Name: Tatu Museyni Nationality: Tanzanian Age: 37                 Dependents: Six children, aged between 3 and 17                 Residence: Mud hut with corrugated iron roof. No running water                  or electricity                 Income: £30 per year                 For Tatu Museyni, the plunge in the price she is paid for her                  coffee crop grown in the lush foothills of Mount Kilimanjaro has                  had two simple effects: ""My children don't go to school and                  we starve.""                 A widow, she relies on the income from her 30 coffee trees in                  the village of Kishimundu, north Tanzania. She has little time                  for the far-off machinations of the international coffee market                  - other than to note with incomprehension and despair that they                  have cut the money she receives in half in less than a year.                 Impoverished growers in Kishimundu and the surrounding communities                  now receive 19p for every pound of Arabica beans they produce                  compared to an already meagre 40p paid last year.                 The result is that Tatu, who lost her husband three years ago                  and struggles to maintain her quarter-acre smallholding, has seen                  what she earns from her main cash crop fall from £13 to £6.21.                  This is her reward for working 12 hours a day and travelling up                  to 14 miles to collect water and provisions. On such an income,                  the battle to pay the £14 annual fee needed to send her two daughters                  - Angera, 15, and 13-year-old Mary - to the village school becomes                  impossible.                 She said: ""Education is very important. It will help my                  children to have a better life. But now it is difficult to pay.                  Sometimes my children are chased out of school because I can't                  pay.""                 The mother, whose dead husband's family refuse to give her financial                  help because of a land dispute, has abandoned plans to send her                  third child, Isaiah, nine, to the school. Instead, she is considering                  selling her pig, her ""savings"" in north Tanzania's agrarian                  economy, to buy her two daughters some extra time at school.

Dear Orin Smith,  As a health conscious, socially and environmentally-concerned consumer I am upset  about the current policies and practices of Starbucks. I am upset about the  introduction of untested, unlabeled, and potentially hazardous genetically engineered  ingredients -- without my knowledge -- into the foods that I consume and serve to  my family.   I am dismayed to learn that Starbucks allows recombinant Bovine  Growth Hormone (rBGH) and other genetically engineered ingredients (soy and soy  derivatives, corn sweeteners, etc.) in your coffee beverages, ice cream, chocolate,  and baked goods.    I am also upset that Starbucks is refusing to brew and serve Fair  Trade, shade-grown coffee in its cafes (as opposed to just selling the beans in bulk);  and that you are not following through completely and transparently on a previous  agreement to improve the wages and working conditions for the thousands of  workers on coffee plantations that supply you with coffee in Guatemala and other  nations. As you know shade-grown Fair Trade coffee (most of which is organic) is  much better for the environment, helping to preserve biodiversity and the precious  habitat of migratory birds and other creatures, as well as being safer for coffee  workers. As you also know, wages and working conditions for small coffee  producers and plantation workers who supply your company with its primary  product are abysmal.  I have reviewed the current information on genetically engineered foods and crops  and I'm gravely concerned about the effects they could have on human health and the  environment.  Since these foods have been rushed to market, there has been no time  to conduct long-term human health studies.  Numerous scientists have warned that  genetic engineering could likely introduce allergens and novel toxins into food, could  lower its nutritional value, and in the case of milk produced with genetically  engineered bovine growth hormone (rBGH), possibly increase the risk of cancer.  I  would like to see Starbucks publicly state that you are removing all genetically  engineered ingredients from your brand-name products, that you will label your  bottled coffee beverages and ice cream as certified rBGH free (or organic), and that  you will pledge never to use genetically engineered decaffeinated coffee beans, which  are currently being field tested by biotechnology companies.  If you cannot guarantee me in writing that you are moving to banish untested,  unlabeled rBGH and other genetically engineered food ingredients from your  brand-name products, brewing and promoting Fair Trade coffee in all your cafes,  and following through completely and transparently on your previous pledge to  improve the wages and working conditions of the plantation workers who supply  you with your coffee--you leave me no choice but to boycott your products, and to  tell everyone else I know to do the same thing. I look forward to receiving a  response from you in writing.  Sincerely,

The  Starbucks Center , world headquarters for  Starbucks , is the second largest building in  Seattle, Washington [ 1 ] , with over 1,800,000 square feet (167,000 m 2 ). It is both the largest and oldest building in the country to earn a national green certification.  [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   History   Originally the building was the central structure in a complex built by  Sears, Roebuck  to fulfill the  Sears Catalog  in the Western U.S. After the catalog business was closed, the building was sold in 1987, and eventually redeveloped as the  Sodo  Center. Later, Starbucks became the building's primary tenant and secured naming rights.

I think they are making the wrong decisions, they are burning out their best people while letting them know that they are expendable. This is my letter to customers as a  Starbucks barista  of over 3 years."" [Note: I've trimmed it a bit -- Starbucks Gossip webmaster]  Starbucks has been my home now for a number of years. It has been a fantastic place to work for, one I wouldn't hesitate to enthusiastically recommend to anyone. I can't do that anymore. ... Here's the thing, we are as busy as ever. Yet the powers that be have told us we have to cut labor, be more efficient, sales are down. Less experienced baristas are having their hours cut to near or below the level of even making them worth having around. That puts more weight on the experienced baristas. But they are cutting the margins on the experienced baristas and shift supervisors as well. And the weight on the managers is intense by this point. Basically without saying it, they are telling us to work off the clock.     ...The only reason I don't leave is because who can pay me what Starbucks does and give me time to go to school, with this economy? For others the question is who else can provide me with the same great insurance that Starbucks provides? This may sound like whining to those who don't have a job at all, but you have to put it in context. If we are only staying because we can't get by the same somewhere else, then how are we supposed to be enthusiastic about our service to Starbucks? These are the baristas who know your kid has his big soccer game today, know that you like an extra shot of espresso Monday morning, and can have your order finished without you have to call it out. I understand that they are hoping we take up the slack so that they won't have to lay anyone off. But the reason sales are down is not the lack of coffee selling, it's the products in the store that aren't selling. All those glorious coffee machines and  French presses  and chocolates and books and ornaments.    If they want to cut labor why not close an hour earlier on a store by store basis. If you have only three customers in the last hour with two baristas closing, the cost of the store being open and the two baristas working outweigh a few mochas. ... I know everyone is forced to do more with less right now, and I know a good, quick short term fix is to cut labor. But cutting labor will hurt Starbucks bottom line in the long run, it will just be harder to calculate.     This isn't a letter asking for pity from the customers. This is a letter to explain to the customers why the waits are longer, the baristas look shell-shocked, and the faces are changing at your local store. The Experience isn't the same anymore.

Saturday, December 23, 2006         Innovations Brewing At Starbucks         Imagine this: A Card that brought in greater than $2.17 billion in revenue since 2001. A Card that gets renewed or in this case reloaded over 38 million times and counting. A Card that customers ""hang on to"" literally, and carry around in their wallets (and are even proud to show it). A Card that will find over 15 million new card owners this holiday season (possibly one of the top holiday gifts). A Card that will bring in more than $170 million in sales, and more than 10 percent of the company's revenue in a quarter. A Card that revolutionized the gift card industry which is worth $24.8 billion, and growing $6 billion each year. This must be a credit card! NOT! Welcome to the world of coffee and the Starbucks Card! Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX) is one of the top 18 innovators in  The Innovation Index . SBUX is up 18% for the year owing to the many innovations it brews each year including the highly successful Starbucks Card that it introduced five years ago and catalyzed the industry of gift cards (as of the last  Innovation Index weekly report ). Starbucks is on an exponential growth tear for the last five years, having grown revenue from $2.6 billion to $7.8 billion in the last five years, with CAGR of 24.10%. How does Starbucks do this? Besides opening new stores at every major intersection where there is a shopping center, at exclusive mall locations, grocery stores, in office complexes, even residential complexes both locally and internationally, and very soon perhaps in residential neighborhoods (if Starbucks has its way), Starbucks has literally created a world of exclusive coffee drinkers overnight who can't have enough of their $2.50 lattes. All these growth has also created complaints against Starbucks from the organic lobby and coffee growers over the world complaining of unfair trade practices. Starbucks latest quarterly earnings grew to $2 billion, up 21% from $1.659 billion in the year ago period. The report reveals many innovations driving revenue growth of over 20% year over year: 1. Starbucks opened 1,040 new stores, including opening of and planned stores in Egypt and Cairo. Further, the innovator is planning to open 2,400 stores in fiscal 2007, and around 700 stores overseas. Starbucks has perfected the innovation process around selecting a new store location, opening the store in record time, and generating superior margins and cash flows within two years. 2. The quarterly Company-operated retail revenues increased 22% to $1.7 billion, from $1.4 billion for the period year period. The increase was primarily attributable to comparable store sales growth of 5% for the quarter compared to the year ago period. The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 4% increase in the number of customer transactions and a 1% increase in the average value per transaction. This was led by innovations across the beverage menu as well as food offerings - increased selection, price changes, and better packaging. 3. Specialty Services revenues increased 16% to $309 million, compared to $267 million for the prior year period. 4. Licensing revenues increased 21% to $223 million versus the prior year period. This was primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from the opening of new licensed retail stores and, to a lesser extent, growth in the licensed grocery and warehouse club business. 5. Foodservice and other revenues increased 5% to $86 million, versus the year ago period. This increase was primarily due to growth in the U.S. foodservice business, partially offset by lower entertainment revenues which included revenue from the sales of Ray Charles' Genius Loves Company CDs outside of Starbucks retail stores in the fourth quarter of 2005. It is evident that new revenue growth is not just created by opening of new company operated stores, but by higher sales at existing stores, specialty services, licensing, foodservice and entertainment sales. Starbucks Innovation pipeline in 2006 and beyond Starbucks is literally planning to transform the Coffee Vending industry, expand reach in Canada and U.K., and accelerate roll-out of warm breakfast offerings in the U.S. with various partners as per the ""innovation pipeline"" announcement in October, 2006. Gerry Lopez, president of Global Consumer Products Group at Starbucks, announced that Starbucks wants to ""transform coffee vending with its plans to offer superior hot latte and cocoa beverages through the Starbucks hot vending initiative"" in partnership with PepsiCo. Lopez also announced an expanded relationship with Kraft to distribute coffee in Canada and the United Kingdom as well as plans to roll out Starbucks™ Coffee Liqueurs to Canada later this month in partnership with Beam Global Spirits & Wine, Inc. Innovations beyond the stores ""Through the Starbucks hot vending initiative, Starbucks aims to transform the hot coffee vending experience by creating a new, high-quality hot drink segment within the estimated $900 million ready-to-drink beverage category in the U.S. The planned introduction of Starbucks hot vending will mark a significant advancement within the vending industry. Unlike any other coffee vending experiences in the market, the Starbucks vending platform utilizes proprietary heat-on-demand technology, developed by PepsiCo, which will offer customers yet another convenient way to enjoy Starbucks on-the-go."" Why is this hot vending initiative innovative? ""Through research and product testing, Starbucks and PepsiCo learned that the common complaints about existing coffee vending included lack of consistent, high-quality coffee, as well as issues with messy and hot-to-hold cups. To tackle these obstacles, Starbucks and PepsiCo developed this revolutionary approach to hot coffee vending. With a simple swipe of a payment card (or with cash), a high-quality, hot latte or hot cocoa is served up in a ready-to-drink package in less than a minute. Utilizing proprietary packaging, each hot beverage will come in a convenient 9 fluid ounce recyclable steel can with an insulating label, designed to keep the beverage warm, enjoyable, and still comfortable to the touch."" Starbucks is planning to recreate the quality and experience of drinking coffee at a Starbucks location with the convenience of savoring it anywhere, and paying for it with cash, Starbucks Card or with a major credit card such as MasterCard®, Visa®, American Express® or Discover®. Hot beverage offerings will include Caff Latte, Vanilla Latte, Caff Mocha, Caff Mocha Light, and Hot Cocoa. Expect Starbucks to hit another home run with this innovation and create another revenue jump in 2007. Distribution Innovations ""Starbucks also announced the expansion of its relationship with Kraft to distribute Starbucks® coffee to a wide variety of retail channels across Canada and the United Kingdom. This will mark the first time Starbucks® coffee will be available through these channels in the U.K. For Canada, the expanded relationship with Kraft will allow Starbucks to further strengthen its presence within grocery and other channels. Since 1998, Kraft has been Starbucks strategic partner in distributing Starbucks® coffee to a wide variety of retail channels including grocery, drug, mass merchandising and club stores in the U.S. Expanding into two new countries allows Starbucks to build on the success of the relationship and allows the Company to leverage Kraft’s extensive distribution network."" Starbucks formula is to create a world of coffee drinkers through massive distribution. It is innovations such as the expanded partnership with Kraft that will bring Starbucks even closer to a store near you, and generate higher sales for Starbucks in 2007. Niche Product Innovations ""Starbucks Coffee Company and Beam Global Spirits & Wine, Inc. are rolling out Starbucks™ Coffee Liqueur and Starbucks™ Cream Liqueur (in Canada). The mixable and versatile liqueurs, which will be positioned beyond the traditional cordial profile, are the first of their kind to feature 100 percent Starbucks® coffee, which is then blended with the finest spirits. These products will be available wherever wine and spirits can be found, not at Starbucks retail stores."" As if coffee drinking was not sufficient, now Starbucks wants to participate in the booming liqueur industry in partnership with established brand such as Beam. Watch out Kahlua. Starbucks is about to invade your decades long hold on the coffee liqueur. And why not? Customers will want more Starbucks coffee in their liqueurs too. Innovations within Starbucks Stores ""Because Starbucks is committed to providing its customers with the most innovative beverage, food and merchandise offerings found anywhere, the Company announced an expanded warming rollout for food. Noting that “great coffee deserves great food,” Michelle Gass, senior vice president for Category Management at Starbucks, revealed plans to greatly accelerate the Company’s roll out of its Warming program for food, including breakfast sandwiches, in its Company-operated retail stores. The Company began testing a warm breakfast sandwich assortment in 2004 and closed that fiscal year with 97 stores offering Warming. That number has grown to approximately 640 stores today and the Company has projected that by the end of fiscal year 2008, there will be approximately 6,500 stores offering Warming. “Food is becoming a central part of the Starbucks Experience and a key driver for our growth,” Gass said. “During the last four years, we’ve seen growth of our food sales outpace our total store sales growth. We attribute this to our focused effort to provide higher quality food options, for different day parts, that can meet the high standards that we place on our beverages.”” In 2006, Starbucks introduced new whole bean coffee and packaging, Starbucks® Pike Place Blend and Starbucks® Anniversary Blend for a limited time throughout the U.S. and Canada to commemorate the Company’s 35th anniversary. Starbucks has launched more than 20 new beverages in the last two years with the most recent addition, the Maple Macchiato. Starbucks is expanding beyond coffee, and this has to make the food industry queasy. Although today, Starbucks is offering breakfast and lunch sandwiches, and brand new beverages such as Maple Macchiato and various health food bars in its own stores, it is a matter of time before Starbucks offers the ready food and sandwiches to regular grocery and convenience stores. After all, the hot vending machine will already provide Starbucks shelf space and entry into convenience stores. What will happen to Starbucks revenue growth? Are we witnessing the beginning of a new food disruption in the making? It is innovations such as Warming which complement coffee that create higher same store sales growth each quarter. Innovations in Entertainment The Starbucks Hear Music™ Coffeehouse are created for specific markets, ""not only through the architectural design, but also with music selected by the Hear Music content team with regional preferences in mind. The unparalleled combination results in a compelling third place destination for customers to connect over coffee as well as explore, discover, personalize and buy quality music in a warm and inviting environment."" The Starbucks Hear Music™ Coffeehouse ""offers customers the ability to browse through the extensive physical CD inventory, which includes a music selection that has been hand-picked by the Hear Music content team to appeal to the local and regional tastes (of a particular location). Customers can also explore a digital inventory of more than one million digital tracks featured on the more than 25 Hear Music™ media bars throughout the store."" Failed Innovations Starbucks recently announced that it is leaving the Jewel food stores in Chicago area beginning early 2007. Dominick's, Jewel's primary competitor, is planning to add more Starbucks stands in their stores. Perhaps the relationship between Starbucks and Jewel soured due to distribution margins or product placement or both. Starbucks does not always win on all the new initiatives. However, as is evident, even here when Jewel food stores is no longer going to carry Starbucks cafes (and their terms), Dominick's is already planning to add more Starbucks throughout its stores. Bottomline Starbucks is one of the top 18 innovators on  The Innovation Index . Starbucks has become a pervasive coffee brand throughout the world, and the company is cleverly exploiting the Starbucks brand to launch new innovations in complementary and adjacent industries accounting for the solid revenue growth. The world according to Starbucks begins with a fresh hot Starbucks Caff Latte made at your neighborhood Starbucks store, or from a hot vending machine at the convenience store using your very own Starbucks Card, a delicious breakfast sandwich or a health bar loaded with almonds (made by Starbucks), another trip to quench that caffeine thirst in the afternoon from the Starbucks store next to your workplace (and another Starbucks sandwich or brownie snack), listening to your favorite music created on a CD burned at the Starbucks Hear Music™ Coffeehouse as you drive to work and back and while you relax, and finally a late evening postprandial Starbucks™ Coffee Liqueur. Starbucks wants you to become that frequent customer who spends upwards of $10 each day on a combination of their handcrafted coffee beverages, sandwiches, cookies and music.

New Years Resolution        10 hours ago                    My success rate at smoking was poor, up until the first of 2009. I gave a new years resolution to quit. At Walgreens I bought a $20 set of seven nicotine patches and slapped one on at midnight. Fourteen days went by, and I have had three cigarettes. That is the best I’ve ever done! Now its time to cut it off completely.

Mind you I am not a smoker of 15 years and this was only a brief relapse but this is day 8 of not smoking and I haven’t had a nicorette since Friday night. I also didn’t have one craving yesterday. I am going to wait another week before I move this into the “I’ve done it” category but I’m really excited. I thought it would have been a lot harder then this as the last time I quit 4 years ago I still had cravings a year later. Am I being crazy for thinking I am out of the woods?

Starbucks is the largest  coffeehouse  company in the world, [ 2 ]  with 16,120 stores in 44 countries. [ 3 ]  Starbucks sells  drip brewed coffee ,  espresso -based hot drinks, other hot and cold drinks, snacks, and items such as mugs and coffee beans. Through the Starbucks Entertainment division and  Hear Music  brand, the company also markets books, music, and film. Many of the company's products are seasonal or specific to the locality of the store. Starbucks-brand ice cream and coffee are also sold at grocery stores.   From Starbucks' founding in Seattle as a local  coffee bean  roaster and retailer, the company has expanded rapidly. In the 1990s, Starbucks was opening a new store every workday, a pace that continued into the 2000s. Domestic growth has since slowed, although the company continues to expand in foreign markets and will open a net of 900 new stores outside of the U.S. in 2009. [ 4 ]  The first location outside of the United States and Canada was established in 1990s, and they now constitute almost one third of Starbucks' stores. [ 5 ]   As of early 2009, Starbucks has more than 16,000 stores in 58 countries worldwide, 11,006 of which are located in the United States, followed by Canada with 976 and Japan with 845 locations. On July 1, 2008, the company announced it was closing 600 under-performing company-owned stores and cutting U.S. expansion plans amid growing economic uncertainty. [ 6 ] [ 7 ]  On July 29, 2008, Starbucks also cut almost 1,000 non-retail jobs as part of its bid to re-energize the brand and boost its profit. Of the new cuts, 550 of the positions are layoffs and the rest are unfilled jobs. [ 8 ]  These closings and layoffs have effectively ended the companys period of growth and expansion that began in the mid-1990s.   On January 28, 2009, Starbucks announced the closure of an additional 300 under-performing stores, and the elimination of 7,000 positions. CEO Howard Schultz also announced that he had received board approval to reduce his salary.

Located in the old Sears, Roebuck and Co. catalog distribution center building.       The original Starbucks was opened in Pike Place Market in Seattle, Washington, in 1971 by three partners: English teacher  Jerry Baldwin , history teacher  Zev Siegel , and writer  Gordon Bowker . The three were inspired by  Alfred Peet , whom they knew personally, to open their first store in  Pike Place Market  to sell high-quality coffee beans and equipment. The original Starbucks location was at 2000 Western Avenue from 19711976. That store then moved to 1912 Pike Place; it is still open. During their first year of operation, they purchased green  coffee beans  from  Peet's , then began buying directly from growers.   Entrepreneur  Howard Schultz  joined the company in 1982, and, after a trip to  Milan, Italy , advised that the company should sell coffee and  espresso  drinks as well as beans. The owners rejected this idea, believing that getting into the beverage business would distract the company from its primary focus. To them,  coffee  was something to be prepared in the home. Certain that there was much money to be made selling drinks to on-the-go Americans, Schultz started the  Il Giornale  coffee bar chain in 1985.   In 1984, the original owners of Starbucks, led by Baldwin, took the opportunity to purchase Peet's (Baldwin still works there today). In 1987, they sold the Starbucks chain to Schultz's Il Giornale, which rebranded the Il Giornale outlets as Starbucks and quickly began to expand. Starbucks opened its first locations outside Seattle at  Waterfront Station  in  Vancouver ,  British Columbia , and  Chicago ,  Illinois , that same year. At the time of its  initial public offering  on the stock market in 1992, Starbucks had grown to 165 outlets.    The first Starbucks location outside of North America opened in  Tokyo  in 1996. Starbucks entered the  U.K.  market in 1998 with the acquisition of the then 60-outlet, UK-based Seattle Coffee Company, re-branding all its stores as Starbucks. By November 2005,  London  had more outlets than  Manhattan , [ 10 ]  a sign of Starbucks becoming an international brand.          A Starbucks coffee shop in  Leeds ,  United Kingdom       In 1999, Starbucks experimented with eateries in the San Francisco Bay area through a restaurant chain called Circadia. [ 11 ]  These restaurants were soon ""outed"" as Starbucks establishments and converted to Starbucks cafes.   In April 2003, Starbucks completed the purchase of  Seattle's Best Coffee  and  Torrefazione Italia  from  AFC Enterprises , bringing the total number of Starbucks-operated locations worldwide to more than 6,400. On September 14, 2006, rival  Diedrich Coffee  announced that it would sell most of its company-owned retail stores to Starbucks. This sale includes the company-owned locations of the Oregon-based  Coffee People  chain. Starbucks has converted the Diedrich Coffee and Coffee People locations to Starbucks as of summer 2007, although the Portland airport Coffee People locations were excluded from the sale. [ 12 ] [ 13 ]   Starbucks' chairman,  Howard Schultz , has talked about making sure growth does not dilute the company's culture  [ 14 ]  and the common goal of the company's leadership to act like a small company.          The first Starbucks branch.       In January 2008, Chairman  Howard Schultz  resumed his roles as President and Chief Executive Officer after an eight year hiatus, and replaced Jim Donald, who took those posts in 2005 but decided to leave the company in late 2007. Schultz's principal challenge is to restore what he calls the ""distinctive Starbucks experience"" in the face of rapid expansion. Analysts believe that Schultz must determine how to contend with higher materials prices and enhanced competition from lower-price fast food chains, including  McDonald's  and  Dunkin' Donuts . On January 31, 2008, Schultz announced that Starbucks would discontinue its warm breakfast sandwich products, originally scheduled to launch nationwide in 2008, in order to refocus the brand on all things coffee. On February 23, Starbucks closed its stores from 5:30 p.m. to 9 p.m. local time to train its baristas. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]   As Starbucks often tests new products as part of its ongoing innovation and transformation, Starbucks started testing selling an 8 oz ""short"" brewed coffee for $1 and giving free refills on all brewed coffee. This test was limited to the greater Seattle market, with no plans for expansion to national markets. Per an internal email this program was cancelled in late March 2008.          A typical sales area, this one in  Peterborough ,  UK , showing a display of food and the beverage preparation area       In March 2008, Schultz made several announcements to Starbucks  shareholders . Shultz introduced Starbucks' ""state of the art espresso system"", [ 17 ]  the  Thermoplan AG  manufactured Mastrena, which replaced their previous superauto, the Thermoplan Verismo 801(known internationally as the Thermoplan Black & White). Starbucks also announced that the company hopes to enter the energy drink market and introduce a customer reward program. Pre-ground beans will also no longer be used, in order that the additional grinding of all whole bean coffee will ""bring aroma, romance and theater"" to American stores. [ 18 ]  The company also announced the recent acquisition of The Coffee Equipment Company, [ 17 ]  the manufacturer of the Clover Brewing System. They are currently test marketing this unique ""fresh-pressed"" coffee system at six Starbucks locations, three in Seattle, and three in Boston. [ 19 ]   In May 2008, a rewards program was initiated for registered users of the Starbucks Card. Previously simply a gift card, the Starbucks Card has undergone a transition into a rewards card, similar to cards offered by other retail outlets. Perks and rewards offered to registered users are 2 hours of free Wi-Fi Internet service per day, free refills of brewed coffee (some locations only honour this for the first 3 hours of your stay), a free tall beverage with the purchase of 1 lb. of whole bean coffee, as well as free milk (e.g. soy) and syrup drink modifiers. [ 20 ]  This is a new and aggressive approach by Starbucks to create and strengthen customer loyalty.   Tags displaying the title ""Master"" are worn by employees who have completed the Coffee Master course, which educates employees in not only the tasting, but also growing regions, roasting, and purchasing (including  fair trade  practices) aspects of the coffee industry. Almost 70% of the coffee used by Starbucks around the world comes from the sixth major producer in the world,  Guatemala , a pro-organic producer.   Starting in November of 2008 Starbucks began selling Product Red goods. According to the website because of this they have been able to provide AIDS medicine for 3,800 for an entire year. [ 21 ]     [ edit ]   Intellectual property   Starbucks U.S. Brands, LLC, is a Starbucks-owned company that currently holds and owns the property rights to approximately 120 Starbucks Coffee Company patents and trademarks. It is located at 2525 Starbucks Way in  Minden, Nevada . [ 22 ]     [ edit ]   Name   The company is named in part after  Starbuck ,  Captain Ahab 's  first mate  in the book  Moby-Dick , as well as a turn-of-the-century mining camp ( Starbo  or  Storbo ) on  Mount Rainier . According to  Howard Schultz 's book  Pour Your Heart Into It: How Starbucks Built a Company One Cup at a Time , the name of the company was derived from  Moby-Dick , although not in as direct a fashion as many assume. Gordon Bowker liked the name ""Pequod"" (the ship in the novel), but his then creative partner Terry Heckler responded, ""No one's going to drink a cup of Pee-quod!"" Heckler suggested ""Starbo"". Brainstorming with these two ideas resulted in the company being named for the  Pequod' s first mate, Starbuck. [ 23 ]          A Starbucks location in the  insa-dong  district of  Seoul ,  South Korea . This particular location is a rarity in that the main sign is not written in  English .       International names include:     Arabic -speaking countries:  (transliteration:  strbaks )   Bulgaria :  (transliteration:  Starbks )   China ,  Hong Kong ,  Macau ,  Taiwan :   Pinyin : xngbk ( xng means ""star"", while  is a  transliteration  of ""-bucks"")   Israel :  (transliteration:  srbaqs )   Japan :  (transliteration:  sutbakkusu , phonological:  staa-bahkss )   Russia :  (transliteration:  Starbaks )   South Korea :  (transliteration:  seutabeokseu ), often used in conjunction with the English name   Quebec ,  Canada : Caf Starbucks Coffee [ 24 ]   Thailand :  pronounced  [satbk]       [ edit ]   Logo          Original brown logo              ""Abraxas"" - Louvre       Valerie O'Neil, a Starbucks spokeswoman, said that the logo is an image of a ""twin-tailed siren"" (the  siren  of  Greek mythology ). [ 25 ]  The logo has been significantly streamlined over the years. In the first version, which gave the impression of an authentic 15th century European  woodcut , the Starbucks siren was topless and had a fully visible double fish tail. The image also had a rough visual texture. In the second version, which was used from 1987-92, her breasts were covered by her flowing hair, but her  navel  was still visible, and the fish tail was cropped slightly. In the current version, used since 1992, her navel and breasts are not visible at all, and only vestiges remain of the fish tails. The original ""woodcut"" logo can still be seen on the Starbucks store in Seattle's Pike Place Market, and on both the House Blend and Decaf House Blend packaging.   At the beginning of September 2006 and then again in early 2008, Starbucks temporarily reintroduced its original brown logo on paper hot drink cups. Starbucks has stated that this was done to show the company's heritage from the Pacific Northwest and to celebrate 35 years of business. The vintage logo sparked some controversy due in part to the siren's bare breasts, [ 26 ]  but the temporary switch garnered little attention from the media. Starbucks had drawn similar criticism when they reintroduced the vintage logo in 2006. [ 27 ]     [ edit ]   Parodies and infringements     [ edit ]   Environmental record          Starbucks inside  Tsutaya  in  Shibuya ,  Japan       In 1999, Starbucks started ""Grounds for your Garden"" to make their business more environment friendly. ""Grounds for your Garden"" is a year round program that gives leftover coffee grounds to anyone requesting it for composting. Although not all stores and regions participate, customers can request and rally their local Starbucks to begin the practice. In 2004, Starbucks began reducing the size of their paper napkins and store garbage bags, and lightening their solid waste production by 1.8 million pounds. [ 28 ] The U.S.  Food and Drug Administration  granted the first-ever approval to use recycled content in  food packaging  for Starbucks coffee cups. In 2005 Starbucks received the National Recycling Coalition Recycling Works Award. [ 29 ]  In 2008, Starbucks was ranked #15 on the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency 's list of Top 25 Green Power Partners for purchases of renewable energy. [ 30 ]   Starbucks has also received criticism from environmentalists. ""Dr. Allen Hershkowitz, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, says that Starbucks claimed they were using only 10 percent recycled material partly because the recycled material costs more."" [ 31 ]  In October 2008, The UK newspaper  The Sun  reported that Starbucks was wasting 23.4 million litres of water a day by leaving a tap constantly running for rinsing utensils in a ' dipper well ' in each of its stores worldwide. [ 32 ]   Does anyone know other environmental impact stats for Starbucks annually-- Asiachai  ( talk ) 17:30, 16 March 2009 (UTC)     [ edit ]   Criticism and controversy          Starbucks at the  Forbidden City  in  Beijing  (closed since July 2007)       Several activist groups maintain websites criticizing the company's  fair-trade  policies, labor relations, and environmental impact, and hold it as a prime example of U.S. cultural and economic  imperialism . Several Starbucks locations were vandalized during the  WTO   meeting held in Seattle in late 1999 .   The Starbucks location in the former imperial palace in Beijing closed in July 2007. The coffee shop had been a source of ongoing controversy since its opening in 2000 with protesters objecting that the presence of the American chain in this location ""was trampling on Chinese culture"". [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ]     [ edit ]   Anti-competitive tactics   Some of the methods Starbucks has used to expand and maintain their dominant market position include buying out competitors' leases, intentionally operating at a loss, and clustering several locations in a small geographical area (i.e., saturating the market), have been labeled anti-competitive by critics. [ 37 ]  For example, Starbucks fueled its initial expansion into the UK market with a buyout of Seattle Coffee Company, but then used its capital and influence to obtain prime locations, some of which operated at a financial loss. Critics claimed this was an unfair attempt to drive out small, independent competitors, who could not afford to pay inflated prices for premium real estate. [ 38 ]     [ edit ]   Labor disputes   Starbucks workers throughout seven different stores have joined the  Industrial Workers of the World  (IWW) as the  Starbucks Workers Union  since 2004. [ 39 ]          Starbucks in the  Financial District  of  Boston, Massachusetts       According to a Starbucks Union press release, since then, the union membership has begun expanding to Chicago and Maryland in addition to  New York City  where the movement originated. [ 40 ]  On March 7, 2006, the IWW and Starbucks agreed to a  National Labor Relations Board  settlement in which three Starbucks workers were granted almost US$2,000 in back wages and two fired employees were offered reinstatement. [ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ]  According to the Starbucks Union, on November 24, 2006, IWW members picketed Starbucks locations in more than 50 cities around the world in countries including Australia, Canada, Germany, and the UK, as well as U.S. cities including New York, Chicago, Minneapolis and San Francisco, [ 44 ]  to protest the firing of five Starbucks Workers Union organizers by Starbucks and to demand their reinstatement.   Some Starbucks baristas in Canada, [ 45 ]  Australia and New Zealand, [ 46 ]  and the United States [ 47 ]  belong to a variety of unions. In 2005, Starbucks paid out US$165,000 to eight employees at its Kent, Washington, roasting plant to settle charges that they had been retaliated against for being pro-union. At the time, the plant workers were represented by the  IUOE . Starbucks admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement. [ 39 ]          A Starbucks located in  Lima ,  Peru       A Starbucks strike occurred in  Auckland ,  New Zealand , on November 23, 2005. [ 46 ]  Organized by  Unite Union , workers sought secure hours, a  minimum wage  of NZ$12 an hour, and the abolition of youth rates. The company settled with the Union in 2006, resulting in pay increases, increased security of hours, and an improvement in youth rates. [ 48 ]   According to Starbucks Chairman Howard Schulz, ""If they had faith in me and my motives, they wouldn't need a union."" [ 49 ]  According to  The Seattle Times , ""The International Union of Operating Engineers Local 286 had trouble with Starbucks at its Kent roasting plant, where the union no longer represents workers"". [ 39 ]   In March 2008, Starbucks was ordered to pay  baristas  over  US$ 100 million in back tips in a  Californian   class action lawsuit  launched by baristas alleging that granting shift-supervisors a portion of  tips  violates state  labor laws . The Company plans to appeal. Similarly, an 18 year-old barista in Chestnut Hill, MA has just filed another suit with regards to the tipping policy. Massachusetts law also states that managers may not get a cut of tips.  [ 50 ] [ 51 ]  A similar lawsuit was also filed in Minnesota on March 27, 2008.  [ 52 ]     [ edit ]   Coffee bean market   In 2000, the company introduced a line of  fair trade  products. [ 53 ]   Of the approximately 136,000 tonnes (300 million pounds) of coffee Starbucks purchased in 2006, about 6 percent was certified as fair trade. [ 54 ]   According to Starbucks, they purchased 2,180 tonnes (4.8 million pounds) of Certified Fair Trade coffee in fiscal year 2004 and 5,220 tonnes (11.5 million pounds) in 2005. They have become the largest buyer of Certified Fair Trade coffee in North America (10% of the global market). Transfair USA, [ 55 ]  the only third-party certifier of Fair Trade Certified coffee in the United States, has noted the impact Starbucks has made in the area of Fair Trade and coffee farmer's lives by saying:       Since launching {its} FTC coffee line in 2000, Starbucks has undeniably made a significant contribution to family farmers through their rapidly growing FTC coffee volume. By offering FTC coffee in thousands of stores, Starbucks has also given the FTC label greater visibility, helping to raise consumer awareness in the process.       Groups such as  Global Exchange  are calling for Starbucks to further increase its sales of fair trade coffees. Fair trade certification can cost US$2,500 to US$10,000, based on the size of the producer group and length of time the inspections take, and many growers are unwilling or unable to pay for certification. [ 56 ]   Beyond Fair Trade Certification, Starbucks argues that it pays above market prices for all of its coffee. According to the company, in 2004 it paid on average $1.42 per pound ($2.64kg) for high-quality coffee beans. [ 57 ]  This is in comparison to commodity prices which were as low as $0.50$0.60 in 20032004. [ 58 ]     [ edit ]   Ethos water controversy          A Starbucks located in  Trujillo ,  Per       Ethos , a brand of bottled water acquired by Starbucks in 2005, is sold at locations throughout North America. Ethos bottles feature prominent labeling stating ""helping children get clean water"", referring to the fact that $.05 from each $1.80 bottle sold ($.10 per unit in Canada) is used to fund clean water projects in under-developed areas. Although sales of Ethos water have raised over $6,200,000 for clean water efforts, the brand is not a charity. Critics have argued that the claim on the label misleads consumers into thinking that Ethos is primarily a charitable organization, when it is actually a for-profit Starbucks brand and the vast majority of the sale price (97.2%) does not support clean-water projects. [ 59 ] [ 60 ]  The founders of Ethos have stated that the brand is intended to raise awareness of third-world clean water issues and provide socially responsible consumers with an opportunity to support the cause by choosing Ethos over other brands. [ 61 ]  Starbucks has since redesigned the American version of the Ethos water bottles, stating the amount of money donated per bottle in the description.     [ edit ]   Brighton store opens in breach of planning regulations   In May 2008, a branch of Starbucks was completed in  Kemptown  on St. James's Street,  Brighton, England , despite having being refused permission by the local planning authority, Brighton and Hove City Council. They claimed there were too many coffee shops already present on the street. [ 62 ] [ 63 ]  Starbucks has appealed the decision, with Brighton and Hove council monitoring the situation. [ 64 ]   Brighton & Hove City Council have served Starbucks with an enforcement notice (which they have appealed) to remove all tables and chairs from the premises in order to comply with planning regulations and operate as an A1 retail shop, rather than an A3 coffee shop/restaurant, for which they have no planning permission. The deadline of the enforcement is 20 February 2009. [ 65 ]     [ edit ]   Alleged relationship with the Israeli military   There have been calls for boycott of Starbucks stores and products because it is alleged that Starbucks sends part of its profits to the  Israeli military . [ 66 ]  It has been long alleged that Schultz is ""an active  Zionist ""  [ 67 ]  and is a recipient of several Israeli awards including ""The Israel 50th Anniversary Tribute Award"" for ""playing a key role in promoting a close alliance between the United States and Israel."" [ 68 ]  In response to these allegations Starbucks issued a statement saying Neither Chairman Howard Schultz nor Starbucks fund or support the Israeli Army. Starbucks is a non-political organization and does not support individual political causes. [ 69 ]  Starbucks has been a regular target of activists protesting against the  Israeli intervention in Gaza . Starbucks was forced to close a store in  Beirut ,  Lebanon  because of demonstrators shouting anti-Israel slogans and causing customers to flee. [ 70 ]  Protesters in Beirut told the  Associated Press  that they targeted Starbucks because they claim Chairman and CEO Howard Schultz donates money to the Israeli military. They hung several banners on the shop's window and used white tape to paste a  Star of David  over the green-and-white Starbucks sign. They also distributed a letter saying Schultz ""is one of the pillars of the American  Jewish lobby  and the owner of the Starbucks,"" which they said donates money to the Israeli military. [ 71 ]  Starbucks responded by saying ""Rumors that Starbucks Coffee Company and its management support Israel are unequivocally false. ... Starbucks is a nonpolitical organization and does not support political causes. Further, political preferences of a Starbucks partner [employee] at any level have absolutely no bearing on Starbucks company policies."" [ 72 ]     [ edit ]   Violence against Starbucks in the United Kingdom   On January 12, 2009, a Starbucks in Whitechapel Road in  London  was the target of vandalism by pro- Palestinian  demonstrators broke windows and reportedly ripped out fittings and equipment after clashes with riot police. Later the same day, after midnight, a suspected makeshift firebomb was hurled into the premises, causing further damage. [ 73 ] [ 74 ] [ 75 ]   On January 17, 2009, at an anti-Israel protest held by the  Stop the War Coalition  in  Trafalgar Square  in central  London , British Rapper  Lowkey  stated, with regard to Starbucks, that: ""You say you know about the Zionist lobby but you put money in their pockets every time youre buying their coffee."" After the rally, two groups of people, many wearing scarves over their faces, smashed and looted two Starbucks on Piccadilly and Shaftesbury Avenue. Although the Starbucks stores had requested greater police protection following the violence against a Starbucks the previous week,  Scotland Yard  stated it could ""not stop thugs hell-bent on causing damage."" [ 76 ] [ 74 ] [ 77 ] [ 78 ]     [ edit ]   Accusations by Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi   In a sermon delivered by Muslim cleric Sheikh  Yusuf al-Qaradawi , which aired on  Al Jazeera TV  on January 9, 2009 (as translated by MEMRI), Al-Qaradhawi accused Starbucks of supporting Israeli education and the Israeli Army and called for a boycott of the company and other western chains. [ 79 ]  Al-Qaradawi has previously called for a similar boycott of all US products with limited success. [ 80 ]  Starbucks has not commented directly on Al-Qaradawi's accusations, but has in the past, denied supporting Israel or any other political action. [ 73 ]     [ edit ]   Other ventures   Main article:  Hear Music   Starbucks entered the music industry in 1999 with the acquisition of Hear Music, and the film industry in 2006 with the creation of Starbucks Entertainment. Starbucks Entertainment was one of the producers of the 2006 film  Akeelah and the Bee . Retail stores heavily advertised the film before its release.   Hear Music is the brand name of Starbucks' retail music concept. Hear Music began as a catalog company in 1990 and was purchased by Starbucks in 1999. Nearly three years later, in 2002, they produced a Starbucks opera album, featuring artists such as  Luciano Pavarotti .     [ edit ]   Partnership with Apple   Starbucks has agreed to a partnership with  Apple  to collaborate on selling music as part of the coffeehouse experience. In October 2006, Apple added a Starbucks Entertainment area to the  iTunes Store , selling similar music that appeared in Starbucks stores. In September 2007 Apple announced that there would be wireless communication between Apple and Starbucks. Through the AT&T Wi-Fi, a paywall is opened up to allow any individual connecting to AT&T wifi access to the  iTunes Store  (regardless of whether he or she is an AT&T subscriber). The partnership is primarily targeted at  iPhone ,  iPod Touch , and  Macbook  users (although anyone with access to iTunes can take advantage of it). In addition, the iTunes Store will automatically detect the current and last 10 songs playing in a Starbucks and offer users connected to the store's wireless network the opportunity to download the tracks. This feature has been rolled out in  Seattle ,  New York City , and the  San Francisco Bay Area , and will slowly be offered in limited markets during 20072008. [ 81 ]  During the fall of 2007, Starbucks also began to sell digital downloads of certain albums through iTunes. The buyer would buy the download at Starbucks, and enter the code on the download card at the iTunes Store, and then the entire album would immediately start downloading. From October 2 to November 7, 2007, Starbucks gave away 37 different songs for free download through iTunes as part of the ""Song of the Day"" promotion. Each day, baristas would give out download cards for a particular song which could be redeemed on iTunes. Currently, every Tuesday, a new ""Pick of the Week"" download card is available at Starbucks for a free song download, similar to its previous ""Song of the Day.""

clueweb09-en0007-77-05484	  s/r home   |  issues   |  authors   |   25 contents   Synthesis/Regeneration  25    (Summer 2001)   Biodevastation: Why Target Starbucks?        Frankenbuck$            by Ronnie Cummins, Organic Consumers Association              Why Target Starbucks?  The GE Food Issue     Despite rising consumer concerns, Starbucks stubbornly refuses to guarantee that the milk, chocolate, ice cream, and baked goods they are selling are free of recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone (rBGH) and other genetically engineered ingredients (including soy derivatives and corn sweeteners).  Starbucks needs to get rid of all GE food ingredients and label its packaged or bottled products as being GE-free.    Several thousand Starbucks outlets are still using milk coming from dairies that allow cows to be injected with Monsanto's controversial Bovine Growth Hormone, a hormone often associated with higher risks for cancer in humans. rBGH is a powerful drug, which cruelly damages the health of dairy cows, forcing them to give more milk. Milk from rBGH-injected cows is also likely to contain more pus, antibiotic residues, and bacteria.  Monsanto's rBGH is banned in every industrialized country in the world except for the United States.  Starbucks is one of the largest buyers of rBGH-tainted milk in the world. Labeling its bottled coffee beverages and ice cream, which are sold in thousands of retail stores, as rBGH-free will send a powerful message to Monsanto and the dairy industry that consumers want rBGH taken off the market.           Starbucks is one of the largest buyers of rBGH-tainted milk in the world.         Although biotechnology corporations are currently field-testing genetically engineered decaffeinated coffee beans, Starbucks has not taken a public stand on whether or not it intends to purchase these genetically engineered coffee beans in the future.    Why Target Starbucks?   Environmental and Social Justice Issues     Although Starbucks has recently bowed to consumer pressure and begun selling certified Fair Trade, shade-grown (organic or transition to organic) coffee beans in bulk, they are refusing to brew and seriously promote Fair Trade coffee, unlike a number of other gourmet coffee shops and companies.    Only shade-grown or organic coffee, which avoids the use of the use of toxic pesticides and chemical fertilizers, protects the environment and preserves the forest canopy and the priceless biodiversity of plants and animals (including migratory songbirds). All coffee certified as Fair Trade or organic is shade-grown, as opposed to corporate plantation coffee, which is grown out in the direct sunlight, utilizing pesticides and chemical fertilizers, typically on large plantations where the surrounding forest cover has been completely chopped down. Wages paid to impoverished farm workers on the typical sun-grown coffee plantations supplying Starbucks and other large coffee buyers average out to approximately $600 per year, less than the annual cost of a daily Starbucks latte in the US, Canada, Japan, or Europe.          Only shade-grown or organic coffee, which avoids the use of the use of toxic pesticides and chemical fertilizers, protects the environment...         Coffee is the largest agricultural export commodity on the world market, with 18 billion dollars in annual sales. The total US import market, the largest in the world, totals almost four billion dollars. Coffee is a widely cultivated crop that can readily be converted to or maintained as 100% shade-grown and organic. It is the most important export of dozens of developing nations, including Mexico and the nations of Central America. There are 25 million, mainly small, coffee farmers left in the world, most of whom are growing coffee in a sustainable and organic manner. Many of these indigenous and small farmers, who inhabit the most biologically diverse and fragile areas of the world (the mountains and rainforests of Chiapas, Oaxaca, and Guatemala for example), are trying to make a living in the face of intense economic exploitation, racial discrimination, and government repression.    The only way these campesinos (farmworkers) and small coffee farmers can survive, and thereby preserve global biodiversity, is to get a better price for their coffee, which the Fair Trade coffee movement provides. However it is market demand in the industrialized North that determines how much Fair Trade coffee gets sold, and in turn how many coffee growers can be enrolled in Fair Trade cooperatives and programs. Because companies like Starbucks and institutional food vendors like Sysco are not brewing, seriously selling, and heavily promoting Fair Trade coffee, most coffee sold today is sun-grown, plantation coffee. Only 550,000 or 2% of the world's coffee growers now benefit from being part of the Fair Trade movement. We need to increase this percentage, as quickly as possible, or else indigenous and rural communities across the global South and tropical biodiversity will perish. Analysts estimate that as many as 50% of shade-grown coffee producers in countries like Mexico will abandon production over the next few years unless market demand for Fair Trade coffee increases dramatically.           ...50% of shade-grown coffee producers will abandon production over the next few years unless market demand for Fair Trade coffee increases...         Unfortunately the world's small, shade-grown coffee producers are being forced out of business and off the land by a ruthless global coffee cartel determined to drive down the prices paid to coffee farmers and control the world coffee market, in the process forcing their industrial model on the entire world. Currently four food giants basically control the world's coffee supply: Procter and Gamble (Folgers); Kraft/Phillip Morris (Maxwell House); Sarah Lee (European brands); and Nestle (Hills Brothers). Buyers for these conglomerates have recently been paying small farmers as little as $0.30 a pound for their coffee beans, a literal starvation price which is equal to less than 1/3 of what it costs these farmers to actually produce the coffee. Fair Trade coffee, on the other hand, guarantees producers at least $1.26 per pound, a price which will steadily increase as corporations such as Starbucks are forced to begin to brew and promote Fair Trade coffee on a major scale.    Despite promises made since 1995 to improve the wages and working conditions of impoverished workers on the coffee plantations of its suppliers in Guatemala and other nations, Starbucks has offered little or no evidence that it has fulfilled this promise, other than to provide public relations brochures in its cafes bragging about how socially responsible they are.    Bringing Together Food Safety,   Environmental, & Social Justice Issues     The time has come to build a broader and more powerful movement against genetically engineered foods, factory farming, and chemical-intensive agriculture. One of the best ways to do this is to bring together people whose primary concern is social justice or preserving the environment and biodiversity, with those whose passion is stopping genetic engineering and converting the world's agricultural system to organic farming as soon as possible. And of course in reality all of these crucial issues are inextricably interconnected. Genetic engineering poses a mortal threat to public health, biodiversity, and the environment, and, in addition, is basically being used as a tool for corporate agribusiness monopolies to drive most of the world's two billion small farmers and rural villagers off the land and replace them with a more profitable US-style system of factory farming and industrial agriculture. Environmental preservation, sustainable development, and social and economic justice go hand-in-hand.    Organic farmers, in this case shade-grown coffee growers, cannot afford to grow the crops that we need and exercise a sustainable and ethical stewardship over the land, unless they get a fair price for their labor. If we allow the global coffee cartel, and its accomplices such as Starbucks, to continue to control the food and beverage choices of the world's consumers, restricting Fair Trade and organic coffee to being nothing more than a small niche market, 20 million small shade-grown coffee producers will shortly be forced off the land, allowing the timber companies, plantation owners, and cattle barons waiting in the wings to chop down the remaining forests and eliminate much of what's left of tropical and semi-tropical biodiversity.    But of course with your help, and the combined efforts of the emerging global movement of consumers, food activists, and anti-sweatshop Fair Trade organizations, we can stop this war on nature and indigenous people and convert our global agricultural system to one that is organic, sustainable, and equitable.    The Starbucks Campaign:  What You Can Do to Help         If you are willing to help leaflet a Starbucks outlet in your community, send an email to simon@organicconsumers.org or call 510-525-7054.       GO INSIDE a Starbucks outlet and talk to the manager or the person in charge. Print out our Frankenbucks leaflet off our website before you go into the store. Show them this leaflet and ask them for a verbal and written assurance that they will change their policies.       ASK STARBUCKS to show you what brand of milk they are using in your coffee and take note of whether or not it is labeled as rBGH-free (sometimes called rBST). If you're ordering soy milk with your coffee, make sure it's labeled as organic or else as free of genetically engineered soy and soy derivatives. Ask if Starbucks baked goods are guaranteed to be free from genetically engineered soy, soy derivatives, corn sweeteners, and cooking oils.       IF YOU ORDER A COFFEE FROM STARBUCKS tell them to please brew your coffee with Fair Trade coffee beans. Or else take your business elsewhere.       ASK STARBUCKS for a written assurance that they will cooperate with international human rights monitors to guarantee their pledge that they are raising the wages and working conditions of the coffee plantation workers of their suppliers in Guatemala and other nations.       PATRONIZE SOCIALLY AND ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE BUSINESSES AND PRODUCTS. If one of Starbucks competitors is brewing Fair Trade coffee or avoiding genetically engineered ingredients, give your business to them instead of Starbucks.       JOIN THE ORGANIC CONSUMERS ASSOCIATION AND THE GROWING FAIR TRADE MOVEMENT ACROSS THE USA. Keep Informed by visiting our web site www.organicconsumers.org        CALL, WRITE, FAX, or EMAIL STARBUCKS. Tell them to send you a written guarantee that they will change their policies on genetically engineered foods, Fair Trade coffee, and wages and working conditions of coffee plantation workers, or else you will no longer buy their products.              STARBUCKS CONTACT INFORMATION:      Telephone: 800-235-2883  Fax: 206-447-3432    Mail:    Mr. Orin Smith, CEO    Starbucks Coffee Company  P.O. Box 34067  Seattle, WA 98124-1067      email:  go to their website  http://www.starbucks.com/  and send them an email.     Note:  Starbucks may likely change its email or telephone numbers to deal with the fact that they are being swamped with calls and emails. Send them a letter or fax if you can, or better yet visit one of their stores directly and voice your concerns.             Reprinted from  BioDemocracy News  #32 (March 2001).

I think they are making the wrong decisions, they are burning out their best people while letting them know that they are expendable. This is my letter to customers as a  Starbucks barista  of over 3 years."" [Note: I've trimmed it a bit -- Starbucks Gossip webmaster]  Starbucks has been my home now for a number of years. It has been a fantastic place to work for, one I wouldn't hesitate to enthusiastically recommend to anyone. I can't do that anymore. ... Here's the thing, we are as busy as ever. Yet the powers that be have told us we have to cut labor, be more efficient, sales are down. Less experienced baristas are having their hours cut to near or below the level of even making them worth having around. That puts more weight on the experienced baristas. But they are cutting the margins on the experienced baristas and shift supervisors as well. And the weight on the managers is intense by this point. Basically without saying it, they are telling us to work off the clock.     ...The only reason I don't leave is because who can pay me what Starbucks does and give me time to go to school, with this economy? For others the question is who else can provide me with the same great insurance that Starbucks provides? This may sound like whining to those who don't have a job at all, but you have to put it in context. If we are only staying because we can't get by the same somewhere else, then how are we supposed to be enthusiastic about our service to Starbucks? These are the baristas who know your kid has his big soccer game today, know that you like an extra shot of espresso Monday morning, and can have your order finished without you have to call it out. I understand that they are hoping we take up the slack so that they won't have to lay anyone off. But the reason sales are down is not the lack of coffee selling, it's the products in the store that aren't selling. All those glorious coffee machines and  French presses  and chocolates and books and ornaments.    If they want to cut labor why not close an hour earlier on a store by store basis. If you have only three customers in the last hour with two baristas closing, the cost of the store being open and the two baristas working outweigh a few mochas. ... I know everyone is forced to do more with less right now, and I know a good, quick short term fix is to cut labor. But cutting labor will hurt Starbucks bottom line in the long run, it will just be harder to calculate.     This isn't a letter asking for pity from the customers. This is a letter to explain to the customers why the waits are longer, the baristas look shell-shocked, and the faces are changing at your local store. The Experience isn't the same anymore.

Starting with a pilot store in Santa Monica, Starbucks has plans to roll out fully-integrated CD burning caf-music stores beginning in August with ten stores in Seattle and a few thereafter in Austin.      The article goes on to reference Theodore Levitts Marketing Myopia assertion that companies should not narrowly define the business they are in and how Starbucks is clearly not limiting their business to the coffee business, but rather to a lifestyle of comfort, affluence, and convenience.    The crux of the feature story centers around this quote,  This push into music is the start of a daring effort to reinvent one of the worlds best-known brands .    Having worked for Starbucks from 1994 to 2003, I read this Fast Company article with a somewhat skeptical insiders eye and left with questions related to music, margins, motives, and mochas.    Why does Starbucks need reinventing?  Same store sales have been in double-digits for nearly two years. Year-to-date, revenue is growing at a robust 28.8%.  Starbucks stock is trading at an all-time high.  The company has upped its earnings projection for 2004.  The brand strength has never been stronger having received accolades and recognition from across the globe.    Are those symptoms of a company that needs reinventing?  I think not.    True & Starbucks success could come to a grinding halt.  However, given the business performance and brand performance since going public in 1992, Starbucks is well positioned to milk future success for years on end without having to reinvent itself through transformative change.    Will burning music CDs financially reinvent the company?  Profit margins in the espresso business are HUGE!!!  Huge as in up to 95% margins.  Profit margins in the downloaded music are SLIM!!!  Slim as in the wholesale costs for an individual song range from 65 cents to 79 cents and the going download rate for a single tune is around $1 dollar.    Given the slim margins in downloading music, I have my doubts that itll financially reinvent Starbucks.  Ill take the margins in mochas over the margins in music any day.    Can Starbucks reinvent itself by financially exploiting a technology adjacency?  Starbucks has garnered tremendous media attention for their wi-fi hot spots.  Nearly every article that mentions wi-fi also mentions Starbucks.  But, how has wi-fi financially impacted the business at Starbucks?   To my knowledge, Starbucks has not released numbers detailing the financial impact wi-fi has had on driving top-line sales.    From my unsubstantiated research, I believe Starbucks has increased their road warrior business traveler customer base through wi-fi.  Most of the users Ive seen are business types whose companies pay for the spendy service.    My insider knowledge does know Starbucks benefited greatly from the wi-fi installations as it significantly upgraded their back-of-house technology.  Through the wi-fi connection, Starbucks locations now have a two-way high-speed network connection with headquarters.  Better yet, all this enhanced technology came at virtually no out-of-pocket expense from Starbucks.     Free wi-fi is fast becoming a cost of doing business for coffeehouses and other ""third place"" community gathering spots.  In Austin, every other coffeehouse, besides Starbucks, offers free wi-fi to their customers.  For coffeehouses, there seems to be very little money to be made in wi-fi hot spots.  Sure, a customer may linger longer but lingering doesnt always translate into incremental sales.    Will customers embrace burning CDs at Starbucks and not at home?  I have not used the CD-burning system at the one Starbucks caf-music location.  However, Im hard-pressed to believe the technology interface in the download kiosk is easier to use than standard CD read/write technology readily available and used today on a home computer.      The learning curve to download music and burn to a CD with a home computer is not that steep.  Because it is so easy to make a CD at home, I struggle to believe that Starbucks can make it any easier for customers.    Then again, making coffee at home is ultra-easy and Starbucks has seemingly made it easier, more convenient, and tastier for customers. But thats coffee and Starbucks has been in the coffee business since 1971, not the music business.      If Starbucks is busy doing music and entertainment, who is busy doing coffee?  Label me old-school, but with each move Starbucks makes into the entertainment and technology area, the farther they deviate from coffee.      I firmly believe a company jumps the brand when they promote their brand over the category.  Starbucks used to be about promoting the coffee category.  They have and are still transforming the coffee category.  But with each step into music and entertainment, Starbucks seems to be more about promoting the Starbucks branded lifestyle experience than promoting the coffee category.    So, if Starbucks is busy doing music and entertainment, who is busy doing coffee?   Peets .    Am I totally against Starbucks entering the music and entertainment business?  No, not at all.  I fully support Starbucks enhancing the coffee experience by offering music and entertainment options.  However, I am not going to fall victim to the thinking that burning a music CD in Starbucks is a transformative tectonic-plate shift in reinventing the Starbucks brand.      Instead, I see Starbucks offering entertainment options as an enhancement to the Starbucks experience and not as a reinvention of the Starbucks brand.

But do you think perhaps that this could actually benefit Starbucks not so much by creating music margin as creating another reason for repeat visits - and the coffee purchases that such visits will facilitate?             Posted by:     Mark Ramsey  |     June 29, 2004 at 08:20 AM                          Good question Mark.    Driving incremental visits and incremental purchases is exactly what Starbucks hopes to accomplish with their caf-music stores.  That is exactly the story Starbucks will pitch to Wall Street.  Its the same pitch they gave to Wall Street regarding the potential impact of wi-fi.    I am not questioning the relevance of these growth initiatives with analysts living Wall Street.  I am questioning the relevance with customers living on Main Street.    Maybe my opinions would change if I saw the financial impact wi-fi has had on the business at Starbucks.  It was sold to Wall Street as a financial growth engine and sold to Main Street as an enhancement to the experience.      Wi-fi has succeeded as an enhancement to the experience with customers.  But, has that experience enhancement translated into incremental sales?  I dont know.    Chasing technology is tough, especially for a retailer based in coffee and not technology.  By the time Starbucks is able to roll-out the fully integrated caf-music stores (which will be a minimum of 24 months), how will technology change the burning music CD opportunity?  Will technology improve the at-home CD burning experience to make the Starbucks initiative obsolete with customers living on Main Street?    Would Starbucks be better off searching for growth opportunities closer to their coffee competency and not to their branded lifestyle experience competency?  I reckon time will tell.

Much of what you say in this one may be right on in terms of why this is a bad idea for Starbucks, but I have a major beef with the first reason you give. Frankly, I'm surprised you gave it.    I'm referring to the part where you ask: ""Does Starbucks need reinventing?"" You basically argue that they don't, but I would argue that the time to be seeking ways to reinvent yourself is precisely when you are at the top of your game and others are starting to imitate you with some success. If you wait too long, you're done.    Whether or not music is the best way for Starbucks to do it remains to be seen -- I suppose I'm skeptical like you. But I would argue that now is the time for them to be thinking about reinvention or face a long, downhill journey to irrelevance.             Posted by:    ScottB |     June 29, 2004 at 11:56 AM                          Scott & I agree that it is far better to experiment with new initiatives in good times rather than bad.  In good times it signals forward-thinking while in bad times, it signals desperation.    Ill quickly go back to the question at hand & does Starbucks need reinventing?      I just dont think so.    However, I do think the Starbucks brand  needs to remain relevant  and I suggest Starbucks do this through evolutionary means and not through revolutionary ways.      There is still plenty of opportunity for the Starbucks brand to remain relevant by focusing on their core competency of coffee to further evolve the Starbucks experience.      I am not convinced that Starbucks should fall victim to lifestyle brand mentality and attempt to reinvent the brand by revolutionizing the retail music industry.      Revolutionizing the music industry to reinvent the Starbucks brand is too much of a stretch for this old school Starbucks marketer.                Posted by:     johnmoore (from Brand Autopsy)  |     June 29, 2004 at 01:48 PM                          Whenever Starbuck tries to sell me anything other than coffee, I get irritated. Even the muffins were suspect at first. Heh.    If Starbucks falls out of love with coffee and takes on a new mistress, Miss Third Place, it's over.    The thing is, they don't need to sell me anything else. They get plenty money from me and others like me already. But they now have Wall Street breathing down their necks (as the latter is wont to do). All the music is, is them reaching for the soap.             Posted by:     hugh macleodh  |     June 30, 2004 at 06:28 AM                          Combined technology and branding comment:     I think Starbucks may even be adopting this technology too late. The Starbuck experience is about top-quality coffee (and muffins) served quickly. It's not about delayed gratification, and so the smaller the time between buying anything from Starbucks and using it, the more it fits the brand. I bet that the real USP would be to enable people to download MP3s or WMAs straight into their IPod or Walkman. CD players are not the mode chosen by the young elite Starbucks presumably targets. Enjoy your latte while you listen to your new tracks! You could arrange for the CD to be mailed later if you wanted the older medium, too.              Posted by:    Nathan  |     June 30, 2004 at 08:04 AM                          Nathan ... I agree totally with you ... this service must be able to download tunes directly to your MP3 player or some other mini-sized USB gadget.      In fact, one of my first questions to a Starbucks partner (employee) after reading the Fast Company piece was 'can this work with my iPod.'  'Not currently,' my well-informed source said.  However he did go on to say Starbucks is looking to add that enhancement.     Interesting thoughts on delayed gratification and its impact on the brand juju of Starbucks.      Good stuff, thanks for adding to the conversation.

Don't talk like that, especially not on the internet! But I am proud you spelled 'gratification' correctly.

I don't go to Tower Records for the coffee, and I wouldn't go to Starbucks for the CDs. By all means, leverage the brand, but don't dilute it.

Starbucks and (RED) Debut the (STARBUCKS)RED Card to Help Save Lives in Africa    14:10 18.12.08           New Product Introduction Builds on Momentum from First Two Weeks of Sales of the (STARBUCKS)RED EXCLUSIVE Beverages Which Have Generated Contributions Equal to More Than 1.4 Million Daily Doses of Lifesaving Antiretroviral Medicine  SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--             Starbucks Coffee Company (Nasdaq: SBUX) announced today that beginning        January 3, customers will have the opportunity to make their purchase at        Starbucks stores (RED) when they use the new  (STARBUCKS) RED         Card,  a stored value Card that can be given as a gift        or purchased for personal use at participating stores in the U.S. and        Canada .  Starting January 3 and continuing through December 31,        2009,  every time a customer uses this Card to make a purchase at        Starbucks, five cents will go directly to the Global Fund to help save        lives in Africa.                    The (STARBUCKS) RED  card builds on the partnership between        Starbucks and (RED) which was launched on November 27 with the        introduction of the (STARBUCKS) RED  EXCLUSIVE Beverages         Espresso Truffle, Gingersnap Latte, and Peppermint Mocha Twist. When        customers choose a (STARBUCKS) RED  EXCLUSIVE Beverage,        Starbucks contributes five cents directly to the Global Fund, to invest        in African HIV and AIDS programs. In just over two weeks since these        products were introduced, Starbucks customers have generated        contributions equal to more than 1.4 million daily doses of        antiretroviral medicine. This equates to providing lifesaving        antiretroviral therapy to more than 3,800 people with HIV in Africa for        one year.                   Starbucks partnership with (RED) extends it commitment to Africa, a key        coffee growing region. Starbucks currently buys coffee from 10 African        countries including Burundi, Cameroon, Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi,        Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.                   The collective effort in just over two weeks time reflects the spirit        of Starbucks customers, even during difficult times, to create change        and do something good every day, said Michelle Gass, executive vice        president, Marketing and Category. Were excited to create even more        opportunities for our customers to do good everyday with the        introduction of the (STARBUCKS) RED  Card in January. Our        partnership with (RED) not only helps reinforce Starbucks connection to        Africa, it provides an opportunity to raise awareness with Starbucks        customers of a critical issue facing the coffee growing region.                   Customers who register their  (STARBUCKS) RED         Card  on  Starbucks.com/card         will become a member and also receive money-saving benefits and        exclusive offers through the Starbucks Card Rewards program such as free        refills on brewed coffee; free select syrups and milk options like soy        milk or whip cream; and up to two consecutive hours of complimentary        Wi-Fi daily at participating Starbucks in the U.S.                    Starbucks Partnership with (RED) Continues Starbucks Shared Planet        Commitment                    The (STARBUCKS) RED  Card and the multi-year partnership with        (RED) is another iteration of the  Starbucks Shared Planet        commitment  to responsibly serve the communities and people that grow        Starbuckscoffee. Contributions from (PRODUCT) RED  Starbucks        products will go directly to the Global Fund to help save lives in        Africa, a key coffee growing region for the company. In 2009, Starbucks        plans to open Starbucks Farmer Support Centers in Ethiopia and Rwanda.

Fellow Union Members and Friends:   Anna Hurst is a New York City barista, Starbucks Union member, and a single mother of two.   One day in August, Anna went home ill from work at Starbucks. In retaliation, her store manager - abruptly and without notice - denied her any work hours for two full weeks.   Anna needs the money she's owed to put food on the table, pay her bills, and buy Christmas presents for her two children.   Call and/or text message store manager Gwendolyn Krueger today at 551-497-0127 and demand that Starbucks pay Anna what she is owed!

Starbucks is the largest  coffeehouse  company in the world, [ 2 ]  with 16,120 stores in 44 countries. [ 3 ]  Starbucks sells  drip brewed coffee ,  espresso -based hot drinks, other hot and cold drinks, snacks, and items such as mugs and coffee beans. Through the Starbucks Entertainment division and  Hear Music  brand, the company also markets books, music, and film. Many of the company's products are seasonal or specific to the locality of the store. Starbucks-brand ice cream and coffee are also sold at grocery stores.   From Starbucks' founding in Seattle as a local  coffee bean  roaster and retailer, the company has expanded rapidly. In the 1990s, Starbucks was opening a new store every workday, a pace that continued into the 2000s. Domestic growth has since slowed, although the company continues to expand in foreign markets and will open a net of 900 new stores outside of the U.S. in 2009. [ 4 ]  The first location outside of the United States and Canada was established in 1990s, and they now constitute almost one third of Starbucks' stores. [ 5 ]   As of early 2009, Starbucks has more than 16,000 stores in 58 countries worldwide, 11,006 of which are located in the United States, followed by Canada with 976 and Japan with 845 locations. On July 1, 2008, the company announced it was closing 600 under-performing company-owned stores and cutting U.S. expansion plans amid growing economic uncertainty. [ 6 ] [ 7 ]  On July 29, 2008, Starbucks also cut almost 1,000 non-retail jobs as part of its bid to re-energize the brand and boost its profit. Of the new cuts, 550 of the positions are layoffs and the rest are unfilled jobs. [ 8 ]  These closings and layoffs have effectively ended the companys period of growth and expansion that began in the mid-1990s.   On January 28, 2009, Starbucks announced the closure of an additional 300 under-performing stores, and the elimination of 7,000 positions. CEO Howard Schultz also announced that he had received board approval to reduce his salary.

Located in the old Sears, Roebuck and Co. catalog distribution center building.       The original Starbucks was opened in Pike Place Market in Seattle, Washington, in 1971 by three partners: English teacher  Jerry Baldwin , history teacher  Zev Siegel , and writer  Gordon Bowker . The three were inspired by  Alfred Peet , whom they knew personally, to open their first store in  Pike Place Market  to sell high-quality coffee beans and equipment. The original Starbucks location was at 2000 Western Avenue from 19711976. That store then moved to 1912 Pike Place; it is still open. During their first year of operation, they purchased green  coffee beans  from  Peet's , then began buying directly from growers.   Entrepreneur  Howard Schultz  joined the company in 1982, and, after a trip to  Milan, Italy , advised that the company should sell coffee and  espresso  drinks as well as beans. The owners rejected this idea, believing that getting into the beverage business would distract the company from its primary focus. To them,  coffee  was something to be prepared in the home. Certain that there was much money to be made selling drinks to on-the-go Americans, Schultz started the  Il Giornale  coffee bar chain in 1985.   In 1984, the original owners of Starbucks, led by Baldwin, took the opportunity to purchase Peet's (Baldwin still works there today). In 1987, they sold the Starbucks chain to Schultz's Il Giornale, which rebranded the Il Giornale outlets as Starbucks and quickly began to expand. Starbucks opened its first locations outside Seattle at  Waterfront Station  in  Vancouver ,  British Columbia , and  Chicago ,  Illinois , that same year. At the time of its  initial public offering  on the stock market in 1992, Starbucks had grown to 165 outlets.    The first Starbucks location outside of North America opened in  Tokyo  in 1996. Starbucks entered the  U.K.  market in 1998 with the acquisition of the then 60-outlet, UK-based Seattle Coffee Company, re-branding all its stores as Starbucks. By November 2005,  London  had more outlets than  Manhattan , [ 10 ]  a sign of Starbucks becoming an international brand.          A Starbucks coffee shop in  Leeds ,  United Kingdom       In 1999, Starbucks experimented with eateries in the San Francisco Bay area through a restaurant chain called Circadia. [ 11 ]  These restaurants were soon ""outed"" as Starbucks establishments and converted to Starbucks cafes.   In April 2003, Starbucks completed the purchase of  Seattle's Best Coffee  and  Torrefazione Italia  from  AFC Enterprises , bringing the total number of Starbucks-operated locations worldwide to more than 6,400. On September 14, 2006, rival  Diedrich Coffee  announced that it would sell most of its company-owned retail stores to Starbucks. This sale includes the company-owned locations of the Oregon-based  Coffee People  chain. Starbucks has converted the Diedrich Coffee and Coffee People locations to Starbucks as of summer 2007, although the Portland airport Coffee People locations were excluded from the sale. [ 12 ] [ 13 ]   Starbucks' chairman,  Howard Schultz , has talked about making sure growth does not dilute the company's culture  [ 14 ]  and the common goal of the company's leadership to act like a small company.          The first Starbucks branch.       In January 2008, Chairman  Howard Schultz  resumed his roles as President and Chief Executive Officer after an eight year hiatus, and replaced Jim Donald, who took those posts in 2005 but decided to leave the company in late 2007. Schultz's principal challenge is to restore what he calls the ""distinctive Starbucks experience"" in the face of rapid expansion. Analysts believe that Schultz must determine how to contend with higher materials prices and enhanced competition from lower-price fast food chains, including  McDonald's  and  Dunkin' Donuts . On January 31, 2008, Schultz announced that Starbucks would discontinue its warm breakfast sandwich products, originally scheduled to launch nationwide in 2008, in order to refocus the brand on all things coffee. On February 23, Starbucks closed its stores from 5:30 p.m. to 9 p.m. local time to train its baristas. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]   As Starbucks often tests new products as part of its ongoing innovation and transformation, Starbucks started testing selling an 8 oz ""short"" brewed coffee for $1 and giving free refills on all brewed coffee. This test was limited to the greater Seattle market, with no plans for expansion to national markets. Per an internal email this program was cancelled in late March 2008.          A typical sales area, this one in  Peterborough ,  UK , showing a display of food and the beverage preparation area       In March 2008, Schultz made several announcements to Starbucks  shareholders . Shultz introduced Starbucks' ""state of the art espresso system"", [ 17 ]  the  Thermoplan AG  manufactured Mastrena, which replaced their previous superauto, the Thermoplan Verismo 801(known internationally as the Thermoplan Black & White). Starbucks also announced that the company hopes to enter the energy drink market and introduce a customer reward program. Pre-ground beans will also no longer be used, in order that the additional grinding of all whole bean coffee will ""bring aroma, romance and theater"" to American stores. [ 18 ]  The company also announced the recent acquisition of The Coffee Equipment Company, [ 17 ]  the manufacturer of the Clover Brewing System. They are currently test marketing this unique ""fresh-pressed"" coffee system at six Starbucks locations, three in Seattle, and three in Boston. [ 19 ]   In May 2008, a rewards program was initiated for registered users of the Starbucks Card. Previously simply a gift card, the Starbucks Card has undergone a transition into a rewards card, similar to cards offered by other retail outlets. Perks and rewards offered to registered users are 2 hours of free Wi-Fi Internet service per day, free refills of brewed coffee (some locations only honour this for the first 3 hours of your stay), a free tall beverage with the purchase of 1 lb. of whole bean coffee, as well as free milk (e.g. soy) and syrup drink modifiers. [ 20 ]  This is a new and aggressive approach by Starbucks to create and strengthen customer loyalty.   Tags displaying the title ""Master"" are worn by employees who have completed the Coffee Master course, which educates employees in not only the tasting, but also growing regions, roasting, and purchasing (including  fair trade  practices) aspects of the coffee industry. Almost 70% of the coffee used by Starbucks around the world comes from the sixth major producer in the world,  Guatemala , a pro-organic producer.   Starting in November of 2008 Starbucks began selling Product Red goods. According to the website because of this they have been able to provide AIDS medicine for 3,800 for an entire year.

It is located at 2525 Starbucks Way in  Minden, Nevada . [ 22 ]     [ edit ]   Name   The company is named in part after  Starbuck ,  Captain Ahab 's  first mate  in the book  Moby-Dick , as well as a turn-of-the-century mining camp ( Starbo  or  Storbo ) on  Mount Rainier . According to  Howard Schultz 's book  Pour Your Heart Into It: How Starbucks Built a Company One Cup at a Time , the name of the company was derived from  Moby-Dick , although not in as direct a fashion as many assume. Gordon Bowker liked the name ""Pequod"" (the ship in the novel), but his then creative partner Terry Heckler responded, ""No one's going to drink a cup of Pee-quod!"" Heckler suggested ""Starbo"". Brainstorming with these two ideas resulted in the company being named for the  Pequod' s first mate, Starbuck.

In the first version, which gave the impression of an authentic 15th century European  woodcut , the Starbucks siren was topless and had a fully visible double fish tail. The image also had a rough visual texture. In the second version, which was used from 1987-92, her breasts were covered by her flowing hair, but her  navel  was still visible, and the fish tail was cropped slightly. In the current version, used since 1992, her navel and breasts are not visible at all, and only vestiges remain of the fish tails. The original ""woodcut"" logo can still be seen on the Starbucks store in Seattle's Pike Place Market, and on both the House Blend and Decaf House Blend packaging.   At the beginning of September 2006 and then again in early 2008, Starbucks temporarily reintroduced its original brown logo on paper hot drink cups. Starbucks has stated that this was done to show the company's heritage from the Pacific Northwest and to celebrate 35 years of business. The vintage logo sparked some controversy due in part to the siren's bare breasts, [ 26 ]  but the temporary switch garnered little attention from the media. Starbucks had drawn similar criticism when they reintroduced the vintage logo in 2006. [ 27 ]     [ edit ]   Parodies and infringements     [ edit ]   Environmental record          Starbucks inside  Tsutaya  in  Shibuya ,  Japan       In 1999, Starbucks started ""Grounds for your Garden"" to make their business more environment friendly. ""Grounds for your Garden"" is a year round program that gives leftover coffee grounds to anyone requesting it for composting. Although not all stores and regions participate, customers can request and rally their local Starbucks to begin the practice. In 2004, Starbucks began reducing the size of their paper napkins and store garbage bags, and lightening their solid waste production by 1.8 million pounds. [ 28 ] The U.S.  Food and Drug Administration  granted the first-ever approval to use recycled content in  food packaging  for Starbucks coffee cups. In 2005 Starbucks received the National Recycling Coalition Recycling Works Award. [ 29 ]  In 2008, Starbucks was ranked #15 on the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency 's list of Top 25 Green Power Partners for purchases of renewable energy. [ 30 ]   Starbucks has also received criticism from environmentalists. ""Dr. Allen Hershkowitz, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, says that Starbucks claimed they were using only 10 percent recycled material partly because the recycled material costs more."" [ 31 ]  In October 2008, The UK newspaper  The Sun  reported that Starbucks was wasting 23.4 million litres of water a day by leaving a tap constantly running for rinsing utensils in a ' dipper well ' in each of its stores worldwide. [ 32 ]     [ edit ]   Criticism and controversy          Starbucks at the  Forbidden City  in  Beijing  (closed since July 2007)       Several activist groups maintain websites criticizing the company's  fair-trade  policies, labor relations, and environmental impact, and hold it as a prime example of U.S. cultural and economic  imperialism . Several Starbucks locations were vandalized during the  WTO   meeting held in Seattle in late 1999 .   The Starbucks location in the former imperial palace in Beijing closed in July 2007. The coffee shop had been a source of ongoing controversy since its opening in 2000 with protesters objecting that the presence of the American chain in this location ""was trampling on Chinese culture"". [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ]     [ edit ]   Anti-competitive tactics   Some of the methods Starbucks has used to expand and maintain their dominant market position include buying out competitors' leases, intentionally operating at a loss, and clustering several locations in a small geographical area (i.e., saturating the market), have been labeled anti-competitive by critics. [ 37 ]  For example, Starbucks fueled its initial expansion into the UK market with a buyout of Seattle Coffee Company, but then used its capital and influence to obtain prime locations, some of which operated at a financial loss. Critics claimed this was an unfair attempt to drive out small, independent competitors, who could not afford to pay inflated prices for premium real estate. [ 38 ]     [ edit ]   Labor disputes   Starbucks workers throughout seven different stores have joined the  Industrial Workers of the World  (IWW) as the  Starbucks Workers Union  since 2004. [ 39 ]          Starbucks in the  Financial District  of  Boston, Massachusetts       According to a Starbucks Union press release, since then, the union membership has begun expanding to Chicago and Maryland in addition to  New York City  where the movement originated. [ 40 ]  On March 7, 2006, the IWW and Starbucks agreed to a  National Labor Relations Board  settlement in which three Starbucks workers were granted almost US$2,000 in back wages and two fired employees were offered reinstatement. [ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ]  According to the Starbucks Union, on November 24, 2006, IWW members picketed Starbucks locations in more than 50 cities around the world in countries including Australia, Canada, Germany, and the UK, as well as U.S. cities including New York, Chicago, Minneapolis and San Francisco, [ 44 ]  to protest the firing of five Starbucks Workers Union organizers by Starbucks and to demand their reinstatement.   Some Starbucks baristas in Canada, [ 45 ]  Australia and New Zealand, [ 46 ]  and the United States [ 47 ]  belong to a variety of unions. In 2005, Starbucks paid out US$165,000 to eight employees at its Kent, Washington, roasting plant to settle charges that they had been retaliated against for being pro-union. At the time, the plant workers were represented by the  IUOE . Starbucks admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement. [ 39 ]          A Starbucks located in  Lima ,  Peru       A Starbucks strike occurred in  Auckland ,  New Zealand , on November 23, 2005. [ 46 ]  Organized by  Unite Union , workers sought secure hours, a  minimum wage  of NZ$12 an hour, and the abolition of youth rates. The company settled with the Union in 2006, resulting in pay increases, increased security of hours, and an improvement in youth rates. [ 48 ]   According to Starbucks Chairman Howard Schulz, ""If they had faith in me and my motives, they wouldn't need a union."" [ 49 ]  According to  The Seattle Times , ""The International Union of Operating Engineers Local 286 had trouble with Starbucks at its Kent roasting plant, where the union no longer represents workers"". [ 39 ]   In March 2008, Starbucks was ordered to pay  baristas  over  US$ 100 million in back tips in a  Californian   class action lawsuit  launched by baristas alleging that granting shift-supervisors a portion of  tips  violates state  labor laws . The Company plans to appeal. Similarly, an 18 year-old barista in Chestnut Hill, MA has just filed another suit with regards to the tipping policy. Massachusetts law also states that managers may not get a cut of tips.  [ 50 ] [ 51 ]  A similar lawsuit was also filed in Minnesota on March 27, 2008.  [ 52 ]     [ edit ]   Coffee bean market   In 2000, the company introduced a line of  fair trade  products. [ 53 ]   Of the approximately 136,000 tonnes (300 million pounds) of coffee Starbucks purchased in 2006, about 6 percent was certified as fair trade. [ 54 ]   According to Starbucks, they purchased 2,180 tonnes (4.8 million pounds) of Certified Fair Trade coffee in fiscal year 2004 and 5,220 tonnes (11.5 million pounds) in 2005. They have become the largest buyer of Certified Fair Trade coffee in North America (10% of the global market). Transfair USA, [ 55 ]  the only third-party certifier of Fair Trade Certified coffee in the United States, has noted the impact Starbucks has made in the area of Fair Trade and coffee farmer's lives by saying:       Since launching {its} FTC coffee line in 2000, Starbucks has undeniably made a significant contribution to family farmers through their rapidly growing FTC coffee volume. By offering FTC coffee in thousands of stores, Starbucks has also given the FTC label greater visibility, helping to raise consumer awareness in the process.       Groups such as  Global Exchange  are calling for Starbucks to further increase its sales of fair trade coffees. Fair trade certification can cost US$2,500 to US$10,000, based on the size of the producer group and length of time the inspections take, and many growers are unwilling or unable to pay for certification. [ 56 ]   Beyond Fair Trade Certification, Starbucks argues that it pays above market prices for all of its coffee. According to the company, in 2004 it paid on average $1.42 per pound ($2.64kg) for high-quality coffee beans. [ 57 ]  This is in comparison to commodity prices which were as low as $0.50$0.60 in 20032004. [ 58 ]     [ edit ]   Ethos water controversy          A Starbucks located in  Trujillo ,  Per       Ethos , a brand of bottled water acquired by Starbucks in 2005, is sold at locations throughout North America. Ethos bottles feature prominent labeling stating ""helping children get clean water"", referring to the fact that $.05 from each $1.80 bottle sold ($.10 per unit in Canada) is used to fund clean water projects in under-developed areas. Although sales of Ethos water have raised over $6,200,000 for clean water efforts, the brand is not a charity. Critics have argued that the claim on the label misleads consumers into thinking that Ethos is primarily a charitable organization, when it is actually a for-profit Starbucks brand and the vast majority of the sale price (97.2%) does not support clean-water projects. [ 59 ] [ 60 ]  The founders of Ethos have stated that the brand is intended to raise awareness of third-world clean water issues and provide socially responsible consumers with an opportunity to support the cause by choosing Ethos over other brands. [ 61 ]  Starbucks has since redesigned the American version of the Ethos water bottles, stating the amount of money donated per bottle in the description.     [ edit ]   Brighton store opens in breach of planning regulations   In May 2008, a branch of Starbucks was completed in  Kemptown  on St. James's Street,  Brighton, England , despite having being refused permission by the local planning authority, Brighton and Hove City Council. They claimed there were too many coffee shops already present on the street. [ 62 ] [ 63 ]  Starbucks has appealed the decision, with Brighton and Hove council monitoring the situation. [ 64 ]   Brighton & Hove City Council have served Starbucks with an enforcement notice (which they have appealed) to remove all tables and chairs from the premises in order to comply with planning regulations and operate as an A1 retail shop, rather than an A3 coffee shop/restaurant, for which they have no planning permission. The deadline of the enforcement is 20 February 2009. [ 65 ]     [ edit ]   Alleged relationship with the Israeli military   There have been calls for boycott of Starbucks stores and products because it is alleged that Starbucks sends part of its profits to the  Israeli military . [ 66 ]  It has been long alleged that Schultz is ""an active  Zionist ""  [ 67 ]  and is a recipient of several Israeli awards including ""The Israel 50th Anniversary Tribute Award"" for ""playing a key role in promoting a close alliance between the United States and Israel."" [ 68 ]  In response to these allegations Starbucks issued a statement saying Neither Chairman Howard Schultz nor Starbucks fund or support the Israeli Army. Starbucks is a non-political organization and does not support individual political causes. [ 69 ]  Starbucks has been a regular target of activists protesting against the  Israeli intervention in Gaza . Starbucks was forced to close a store in  Beirut ,  Lebanon  because of demonstrators shouting anti-Israel slogans and causing customers to flee. [ 70 ]  Protesters in Beirut told the  Associated Press  that they targeted Starbucks because they claim Chairman and CEO Howard Schultz donates money to the Israeli military. They hung several banners on the shop's window and used white tape to paste a  Star of David  over the green-and-white Starbucks sign. They also distributed a letter saying Schultz ""is one of the pillars of the American  Jewish lobby  and the owner of the Starbucks,"" which they said donates money to the Israeli military. [ 71 ]  Starbucks responded by saying ""Rumors that Starbucks Coffee Company and its management support Israel are unequivocally false. ... Starbucks is a nonpolitical organization and does not support political causes. Further, political preferences of a Starbucks partner [employee] at any level have absolutely no bearing on Starbucks company policies."" [ 72 ]     [ edit ]   Violence against Starbucks in the United Kingdom   On January 12, 2009, a Starbucks in Whitechapel Road in  London  was the target of vandalism by pro- Palestinian  demonstrators broke windows and reportedly ripped out fittings and equipment after clashes with riot police. Later the same day, after midnight, a suspected makeshift firebomb was hurled into the premises, causing further damage. [ 73 ] [ 74 ] [ 75 ]   On January 17, 2009, at an anti-Israel protest held by the  Stop the War Coalition  in  Trafalgar Square  in central  London , British Rapper  Lowkey  stated, with regard to Starbucks, that: ""You say you know about the Zionist lobby but you put money in their pockets every time youre buying their coffee."" After the rally, two groups of people, many wearing scarves over their faces, smashed and looted two Starbucks on Piccadilly and Shaftesbury Avenue. Although the Starbucks stores had requested greater police protection following the violence against a Starbucks the previous week,  Scotland Yard  stated it could ""not stop thugs hell-bent on causing damage."" [ 76 ] [ 74 ] [ 77 ] [ 78 ]     [ edit ]   Accusations by Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi   In a sermon delivered by Muslim cleric Sheikh  Yusuf al-Qaradawi , which aired on  Al Jazeera TV  on January 9, 2009 (as translated by MEMRI), Al-Qaradhawi accused Starbucks of supporting Israeli education and the Israeli Army and called for a boycott of the company and other western chains. [ 79 ]  Al-Qaradawi has previously called for a similar boycott of all US products with limited success. [ 80 ]  Starbucks has not commented directly on Al-Qaradawi's accusations, but has in the past, denied supporting Israel or any other political action. [ 73 ]     [ edit ]   Other ventures   Main article:  Hear Music   Starbucks entered the music industry in 1999 with the acquisition of Hear Music, and the film industry in 2006 with the creation of Starbucks Entertainment. Starbucks Entertainment was one of the producers of the 2006 film  Akeelah and the Bee . Retail stores heavily advertised the film before its release.   Hear Music is the brand name of Starbucks' retail music concept. Hear Music began as a catalog company in 1990 and was purchased by Starbucks in 1999. Nearly three years later, in 2002, they produced a Starbucks opera album, featuring artists such as  Luciano Pavarotti .     [ edit ]   Partnership with Apple   Starbucks has agreed to a partnership with  Apple  to collaborate on selling music as part of the coffeehouse experience. In October 2006, Apple added a Starbucks Entertainment area to the  iTunes Store , selling similar music that appeared in Starbucks stores. In September 2007 Apple announced that there would be wireless communication between Apple and Starbucks. Through the AT&T Wi-Fi, a paywall is opened up to allow any individual connecting to AT&T wifi access to the  iTunes Store  (regardless of whether he or she is an AT&T subscriber). The partnership is primarily targeted at  iPhone ,  iPod Touch , and  Macbook  users (although anyone with access to iTunes can take advantage of it). In addition, the iTunes Store will automatically detect the current and last 10 songs playing in a Starbucks and offer users connected to the store's wireless network the opportunity to download the tracks. This feature has been rolled out in  Seattle ,  New York City , and the  San Francisco Bay Area , and will slowly be offered in limited markets during 20072008. [ 81 ]  During the fall of 2007, Starbucks also began to sell digital downloads of certain albums through iTunes. The buyer would buy the download at Starbucks, and enter the code on the download card at the iTunes Store, and then the entire album would immediately start downloading. From October 2 to November 7, 2007, Starbucks gave away 37 different songs for free download through iTunes as part of the ""Song of the Day"" promotion. Each day, baristas would give out download cards for a particular song which could be redeemed on iTunes. Currently, every Tuesday, a new ""Pick of the Week"" download card is available at Starbucks for a free song download, similar to its previous ""Song of the Day.""
