Everyone else must have a BART ticket. You can determine the cost of your trip by using the  Fare Calculator .   How to Use BART tickets are like debit cards with stored value. All BART stations have automatic ticket vending machines that accept nickels, dimes, quarters and $1 coins, as well as $1 $5, $10 and $20 bills. You can also use credit and debit cards in select machines.   When you enter BART, insert your ticket into the fare gate and it will be returned to you. Use the same ticket when you exit. The correct fare will be automatically deducted and tickets with remaining value will be returned. If your ticket has too little value, a sign on the fare gate will read ""Underpaid: Go to Addfare."" A nearby Addfare vending machine will tell you how much additional fare you must add to your ticket to exit the BART system.   Discount Ticket/Smart Card Types BART offers various discounts ranging from 6.25% to 62.5%. BART fares are set with a mileage-based formula, therefore time-based passes (e.g., weekly or monthly) are not available.   PLEASE NOTE : You can't buy discount tickets at the station from a vending machine. Discount tickets are only sold  online , through the  mail  and at selected  retail vendors  throughout the Bay Area.             BART EZ Rider Card A smart card that's safer, easier to use and more convenient than regular tickets.

The  heavy-rail   public transit  system connects downtown  San Francisco  with suburbs in the  East Bay  and northern  San Mateo County . BART operates five lines on 104 miles (167 km) of track with  43 stations  in four counties. With average weekday ridership of 374,949 passengers [ 1 ] , BART is the  fifth busiest  heavy rail rapid transit system in the  United States .   BART is operated by the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District, a special-purpose  transit district  formed in 1957 covering  San Francisco ,  Alameda , and  Contra Costa  counties. The name  BART  is an  acronym  and is pronounced as a word, not as individual letters. In some ways, BART is a successor to the  Key System , which ran streetcars across the lower deck of the  San Francisco Bay Bridge  until 1958.

Trains on each line historically ran every fifteen minutes on weekdays and twenty minutes during the evenings, weekends and holidays; however, since a given station might be served by as many as four lines, it could have service as frequently as every three to four minutes.   As of January 1, 2008, service on every line is at 15-minute intervals at all times except for Saturdays between 6:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m., when service is at 20-minute intervals. Also, as of January 1, 2008, BART service begins around 4:00 a.m. on weekdays, 6:00 a.m. on Saturdays, and 8:00 a.m. on Sundays. Service ends every day near midnight with station closings timed to the last train at station. Two of the five lines, the  MillbraeRichmond  and  SF/Daly CityFremont  lines, do not have night (after 7 p.m.) or Sunday service, but all stations remain accessible by transfer from the other lines. [ 2 ]   All-Nighter Network  service is available when BART is closed. All but six BART stations are served (as well as eight  Caltrain  stations). BART tickets are not accepted on these buses, and each of the four bus systems charge their own fare, which can be up to  $  3.50; a four-system ride can cost as much as  $  9.50 as of 2007. [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Connecting rail and bus transit services          AC Transit bus stop at Bay Fair Station       BART has direct connections to two  regional rail  services   Caltrain , which provides service between San Francisco,  San Jose , and  Gilroy , at the  Millbrae Station , and  Amtrak 's  Capitol Corridor , which runs from  Sacramento  to San Jose, at the  Richmond  and  Coliseum/Oakland Airport  stations. A third Capitol Corridor connection at the  Union City  station is planned as part of a larger  Dumbarton Rail Corridor Project  to connect Union City,  Fremont , and  Newark  to various  peninsula  destinations via the  Dumbarton rail bridge . [ 4 ]  BART is the managing agency for the Capitol Corridor until 2010. [ 5 ]   BART connects to San Francisco's local  light rail  system, the  Muni Metro . The upper track level of BART's Market Street subway, originally designed for the lines to Marin County, [ citation needed ]  was turned over to Muni and both agencies share the  Embarcadero ,  Montgomery Street ,  Powell  and  Civic Center  stations. Some Muni Metro lines connect with (or pass nearby) the BART system at the  Balboa Park  and  Glen Park  stations.   A number of bus transit services connect to BART, which, while managed by separate agencies, are integral to the successful functioning of the system. The primary providers include the  San Francisco Municipal Railway  (Muni),  Alameda-Contra Costa Transit  (AC Transit),  San Mateo County Transit District  (SamTrans),  Central Contra Costa Transit Authority  (County Connection), and the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District ( Golden Gate Transit ). Until 1997, BART ran its own ""BART Express"" connector buses, [ 6 ]  which ran to eastern Alameda County and far eastern and western areas of Contra Costa County; these routes were later devolved to sub-regional transit agencies such as  Tri-Delta Transit  and the Livermore Amador Valley Transit Authority ( WHEELS ) or, in the case of Dublin/Pleasanton service, replaced by a full BART extension.   BART is connected to  Oakland International Airport  via  AirBART  shuttle buses, which bring travelers to and from the Coliseum/Oakland Airport BART station. These buses are operated by BART and accept exact-change BART fare cards in addition to exact change. BART also connects to the  San Francisco International Airport , though in this case the train actually enters the airport directly and no shuttle is necessary, although connections are available to  AirTrain  for those not departing or arriving from the international terminal.   Other services connect to BART including the  Emery Go Round  ( Emeryville ),  WestCAT  (north-western  Contra Costa County ),  Benicia Transit  ( Benicia ),  Union City Transit  ( Union City ), and the  Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority  (VTA, in  Silicon Valley ).   The bus service connecting the  University of California, Berkeley  to the  Berkeley  BART station was once called  Humphrey Go-BART , a  spoonerism  of the famous actor and director  Humphrey Bogart . It has since been replaced by a number of regular AC Transit bus routes and shuttle bus routes operated by the university.     [ edit ]   Other connecting services   BART hosts  carsharing  locations at many stations, a program pioneered by  City CarShare . Riders can transfer from BART and complete their journeys by car. BART has started to offer long-term airport parking through a third-party vendor [ 7 ]  at most East Bay stations. Travelers must make an on-line reservation in advance and pay the daily fee of $5 before they can leave their cars at the BART parking lot.   Casual carpools  have formed at North Berkeley station and the area around El Cerrito Del Norte station. The lots are convenient since most carpoolers use public transit back to their final destination. However, because of how BART charges for parking, passengers cannot park at most BART lots without paying a fare.

[ 8 ]  The system uses a 5 ft 6 in (1,676 mm)  broad rail gauge , as opposed to the 4 ft 8 in (1,435 mm)  standard gauge  predominantly found in the United States. Trains can achieve a centrally-controlled maximum speed of 80 mph (130 km/h) and provide a systemwide average speed of 33 mph (53 km/h) with twenty-second station dwell times. Trains operate at a minimum length of three cars per California Public Utilities Commission guidelines to a maximum length of 10 cars, spanning the entire 700 feet (213 m) length of a platform. [ 9 ]  At its maximum length of 710 feet (216 m), BART has the longest train length of any metro system in the United States. The system also features car widths of 10.5 feet (3.2 m), a maximum gradient of 4%, and a minimum curve radius of 394 feet (120 m). [ 10 ]          A photo of the third rails used on the  BART  system. Notice how the rail changes location relative to the train upon entering the station and the crossover walkway crossing the trackway. Notice the walkway on the left side of the trackway in the distance, which is the emergency walkway for the aerial trackway leading into the Daly City station  again, the third rail positioned opposite of this walkway.       Electric current  is delivered to the trains over a  third rail , the position of which alternates relative to the context of the train. Inside stations, the third rail is always on the side furthest away from the passenger platforms. This design feature eliminates the danger of a passenger either falling directly on the third rail, or stepping onto it to climb back to the platform should they fall off. On ground-level trackways, the third rail alternates from one side of the track to the other, providing breaks in the third rail to allow for emergency evacuations across trackways.   Underground tunnels, aerial structures and the  Transbay Tube  have evacuation walkways and passageways to allow for train evacuation without exposing passengers to easy, inadvertent contact with the third rail, which is located as far away from these walkways as possible. The voltage on the third rail is 1000 V  DC , so there are notices throughout the system warning passengers of its danger. In addition, BART posts notices inside each train car warning of the third rail and the four paddle-like rail contact shoes protruding from the underside of each car by the rail wheel trucks.   Many of the original system 1970s era BART stations, especially the aerial stations, feature simplistic  Brutalist architecture .   Ridership records have been set during large scale regional-in-scope events such as the  San Francisco Gay Pride Parade . [ 11 ]   [ 12 ]  The records included a Sunday record of 224,500 that coincided with an  Oakland A's  baseball game and a weekday record of 405,400 set on September 8, 2008 when both the  San Francisco Giants  and  Oakland Raiders  had home games. [ 12 ]  The one week record for ridership was 2,317,800 between June 23 and June 29, 2008. this broke the previous all time high of 2,301,800 achieved during a closure of the  Bay Bridge .
