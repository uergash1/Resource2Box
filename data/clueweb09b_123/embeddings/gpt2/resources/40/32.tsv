Geographically, it is the                          furthest east of any country in the Sea (100 miles from                           St. Lucia ), not to mention                          one of the most diverse. Divided into eleven different                          parishes, they are each separate entities with different                          ways of life – moving from the capital city of  Bridgetown                           towards the  expensive villas                           to the west or to the busy bars of the south is as different                          as taking a ferry between, say,  Dominica                           and  Guadeloupe . Culturally,                          Barbados island is exceedingly British. Tea time, cricket                          matches and English pubs are firmly entrenched into everyday                          life here.  Barbados history                           is relatively peaceful, too, in comparison to neighboring                          islands. From 1627 until 1966, the British enjoyed steady                          reign over the island, despite importing the ugliness                          of slavery. Though Barbados history is freckled with attempted                          uprisings, the bloodshed was nothing compared to many                          of the other Caribbean isles.                                     Of all the different locations on Barbados island, the three most popular are the luxurious west coast, the area surrounding the capital city, and the southern coast, where the party ends at dawn.  Usually.                                     Along the west coast you will find secluded Barbados                          villas, some of the most opulent (and, naturally, expensive)                          places to stay in all of the Caribbean. The  Barbados                          beaches  surrounding the unfortunately named Holetown                          are where you go for the definition of luxury vacations                          – Sandy Lane and Tamarind Cove hotels are famed                          for housing British aristocrats on holiday. The Barbados                          villas here are remarkable, a wonderful place for  honeymoons ,                           weddings  and those                          unafraid to splurge while on vacation.                                     The capital city of Bridgetown is another tourist favorite.  Not only do you get instant access to some of the most scenic Barbados beaches (the ever-popular Brighton Beach, for instance), you get to see the rich culture reflected in the city architecture.  Other than the glistening acres of sugarcane that lie in the center of the island, Barbados history is best reflected here – not to mention that most of the nation's population resides around the busy port.  A sense of British sophistication mixed with the elegant Caribbean lifestyle is a wonder to behold.  Not to mention that just south of the city is another enclave of posh Barbados villas, though not nearly as secluded as their cousins to the north.                       But the finest part of Barbados Island lies on the shining southern coast.  Thousands (no, really, thousands) of rum shops (island translation: bars) are found on the island, with the multitude of them located along the Barbados beaches here.  Another island tradition here is the “fish fry,” when villages become party central, and drinks, dancing and heroic amounts of food are laid out for anyone to enjoy.  Calypso, soca and steel drum are alive and well here, and insanely popular.  The price of all this fun is relatively small, too, making this a fantastic destination for the budget traveler.                                                                                                      contact us              |  travel newsletter              |  travel marketing              |  write for us  |               link to us              |  privacy policy               |  terms of use              |  help                           © 2008  Destination360  All Rights Reserved                                                                                                                  Barbados Map                                    Latest Topics     nice place to stay at Bridg...

Parts of the  Greater Bridgetown  area lie along the borders of the neighbouring parishes  Christ Church  and  St. James .   The present day location of the city was established by the  British  in  1628  following their settlement at  James Town . Bridgetown is a major  West Indies  tourist destination, and the city acts as an important financial, informatics and convention centre in the Caribbean region.

Bridgetown's centre was originally composed of a  swamp , which was quickly drained and filled-in to make way for the city's early development.   At the heart of Bridgetown is the Careenage and Constitution River. This body of water provides the city with direct access from medium sized  yachts  or  small craft   boats . Although moderately shallow, the Careenage slices Bridgetown into two parts. During the rainy season the Constitution River flows into the Careenage area and acts as an outflow for water from the islands interior  storm drainage  network. Flowing into the Carlisle Bay on the southwest coast of the island, the Careenage can be observed as a  marina  for boaters entering or exiting the inner basin located directly in front of the Parliament buildings of Barbados.   Barbados has a tropical climate.

It was suspected that this bridge was created by a people indigenous to the  Caribbean  known as the  Arawak . Upon finding the structure the British settlers began to call what is now the Bridgetown area,  Indian Bridge . It is widely believed that the Arawaks were driven from Barbados to the neighbouring island of  Saint Lucia , during an invasion by another people indigenous to the region known as the  Caribs . Eventually after  1654  when a new bridge was constructed over the Careenage by the British, the area became known as  The Town of Saint Michael  and later as  Bridgetown , and the final name stuck.   Bridgetown is the only city outside continental North America that  George Washington  visited. (George Washington House, the actual house where he stayed, is now part of the  Garrison Historic Area )     [ edit ]   From a Town into a City   In 1824 Barbados became the seat of the Anglican ' Diocese of Barbados  and the  Leeward Islands '. Due to this the Saint Michael's Parish Church became raised to the status of Cathedral, in so doing the elevation meant that thereafter Bridgetown would be conferred with city status. In December 1925 a committee sought to petition the King for a Royal Charter of Incorporation to devise local government in the city. The plan stated the desire for Bridgetown to be run by a Mayor, 8 Aldermen, 12 Common councillors, a Town Clerk, a Headborough or Chef Constable, and such other officers as would be deemed necessary. It was proposed that the island's  House of Assembly  should seek to Incorporate the city instead of utilising  Royal Charter .          The Coat of Arms of Bridgetown       Some time later in 1842  Royal Letters Patent  under which Barbados, Trinidad, Tobago, Grenada, Saint Vincent and Saint Lucia were split into separate diocese decreed that henceforth the Town of Bridgetown should henceforth be called the City of Bridgetown.   It was not until 1958 when the Local Government Act was passed in Barbados. Within the act called for separate administration for the city. The act called for a Mayor, 6 City aldermen, and 12 City Councillors -- of which 4 serve each of the 3 Wards in the City.   On 20 September 1960 a grant of Arms was conferred upon the City by the  Royal College of Arms  in  London . The Armorial bearings for the City of Bridgetown were designed by the late Neville Connell, the then director of the Barbados Museum and Historical Society along with H.W. Ince the Honorary Secretary of the Society.   Local governemnt in Barbados was established but not for long, the late E.D. Mottley served as the city's first and only Mayor under the Act. In April 1967 the system of Local Government Councils was dissolved and replaced by an Interim Commissioner for Local Government. The Corporation of Bridgetown thus ceased to exist, and its records and paraphernalia were deposited in both the Government Department of Archives and in the Barbados Museum and Historical Society. [ 1 ]  Today Bridgetown and surrounding constituencies are administered by members of Barbadian parliament.     [ edit ]   Amalgamation of the Governor with the Windward Islands   From 1800 until 1885 Bridgetown served as the main seat of Government for the former  British  colonies of the  Windward Islands . During this period the resident  Governor of Barbados  also served as the  Colonial head of the Windward Islands . After the Government of Barbados officially exited from the Windward Island union in 1885, the seat was moved from Bridgetown to  St. George's  on the neighbouring island of  Grenada .   Barbados has been governed by the Barbados Labour Party  (BLP)  for the last thirteen years, commonly called the ""Owen Arthur Administration"". Prime Minister Owen S. Arthur was chosen from among leaders around the globe to deliver the William Wilberforce lecture on the 200th Anniversary of the Abolition of the Atlantic Slave Trade.     [ edit ]   Events   Amongst the breathtaking landscapes, and the fresh look of the city; Barbados attracts many investors from various fields. The 2007 ICC Cricket World Cup tournament attracted thousands of visitors to the island and was a very prosperous event. The final match was played on Saturday April 28, 2007.

Broad Street passes the Parliament Buildings and serves as the centre of city's shopping area.   Another major traffic artery into the city is Bay Street (which turns into Highway 7) and leads toward the South Coast of Barbados and the Parish of  Christ Church . There are also other notable streets in Bridgetown, including:     Swan Street - which is parallel to Broad Street, to the north.   Roebuck Street - which leads towards Queens Park to the North, and East of Swan Street.     -and-     Tudor Street - which comes from the north, intersects Swan Street and runs perpendicular to Broad Street.   The Spring Garden Highway, which lies to the west of the city, plays host to over 85,000 bystanders and participants in the annual Grand Kadooment Carnival Parade.

The Deep Water Harbour lies a short distance across Carlisle Bay northwest of the Careenage Canal. Found along the Princess Alice Highway, and west of the city's centre around  Fontabelle .   The Harbour port acts as one of the major shipping and  transhipment  hubs from international locations for the entire Eastern Caribbean. Recently the Bridgetown Port was dredged to allow safe access and berthing for the new league of ""super cruise ships"". The dredging project was completed in 2002 and the city can now host many of the largest cruise ships in the world.   The port of  Bridgetown  also handles goods for the domestic needs of the island. The island's main exports of mainly agricultural products also make use of the harbour facilities.   Bridgetown  also has a smaller canal in the centre of the city, named the Careenage, a.k.a. ""Constitution River"". The Constitution River should not be confused with the Deep Water Harbour. The smaller Constitution River feeding into the west coast lies about a half kilometer south of the large harbour. The Careenage is just large enough for pleasure craft or fishing boats and has two main bridges near the city center which span the shallow Careenage.     [ edit ]   Society and culture          Colourful Bridgetown street       Bridgetown serves as a principal centre of commercial activity in Barbados, as well as a central hub for the island's public transport system. Many of the  ministries and departments  of the island's government are located within the Greater Bridgetown area. The Public Buildings or  parliament , which stand at the heart of the city directly north of Heroes Square, house the third oldest continuous parliament in the  British Commonwealth . Indeed, at one point in the city's early history, Bridgetown was the most important city of all British possessions in the New World due to the city's easterly location in the Caribbean region.   For a city of its size, the Greater Bridgetown area is home to several prestigious educational institutions. The city serves as the seat of one of the three campuses of the  University of the West Indies  in the northern suburb of  Cave Hill . The campus sits on a bluff offering a spectacular view of Bridgetown and its port. The  Barbados Community College  is located three miles east of the Central Business District in a suburb known as ""The Ivy"", while the sprawling campus of the  Samuel Jackman Prescod Polytechnic  is located just beyond the eastern limits of the city in a suburb known as "" The Pine "". In addition, the city houses such distinguished secondary schools as  Harrison College ,  Combermere  and The St.Michael School.   The City of Bridgetown also played host to the 1994 United Nations Global Conference on Sustainable Development of Small Islands States.  Bridgetown  has branches of some of the largest banks in the world and English-speaking Caribbean and is internationally recognised as an emerging financial domicile. The city is currently experiencing a phenomenal spurt of redevelopment in preparation for the  2007 World Cricket Cup  Finals to be held at the historic  Kensington Oval . The Oval is being renovated to a state-of-the-art sports facility that will accommodate 30,000 spectators. Live viewership for the 2007 event is estimated to be in the region of two billion people.     [ edit ]   Utilities and local services   Today Bridgetown is a fully modern and thriving city, with access to many modern services including a piped water supply (said to be naturally among the purest in the world), electricity, natural gas supply, cutting-edge telecommunications, wireless services, internet cafes, and a good overall infrastructure. The city is also served by an impressive conference facility known as the  Sherbourne Conference Centre .     Electricity -  Barbados Light and Power Company  Ltd.

The  Bajan , or Barbadian dialect is an iconic part of the culture. But English is still the official language, reflecting centuries of British rule.   The island's British influence stretches back to 1625, when Captain John Powell claimed it in the name of  King James I . The first colonists arrived two years later, founding a settlement of 80 civilians and 10  slaves . Early on, Barbados adopted the British style of government, creating a  Parliamentary democracy  in 1639. During the colonial period, all members of the Legislative Assembly were white. After slavery was abolished in 1838, non-whites quickly began to play a role in the island's government, with the first minority member elected in 1843. Although Barbados gained full independence from Britain in 1966, it has retained its governmental style and remains a member of the  Commonwealth of Nations .   In addition to government, the British passed down their love of  cricket . The most popular sport on Barbados, its  cricket team  has won numerous regional matches. Many players on the team go on to success on the  West Indies team  to compete in international games. In fact, one of the most highly regarded cricket players of all time, Sir  Garfield Sobers , is a Barbados native.   The country's architecture pays further testament to Britain, with many historic buildings still standing. In addition to traditional wood and stone, coral was also used in construction, lending a unique Barbadian flair.  Jacobean ,  Georgian , and  Victorian  styles dominate. But slaves constructed many of these buildings, as well as their own  chattel houses , so they were an integral part of the island's architectural legacy. Built of wood, chattel houses were set atop blocks instead of permanent foundations so they could be easily moved from place to place. The vivid colors of these chattel houses shows the West African influence.   Religion plays an important role in life on the island. With its long British ties, the  Anglican  church serves the largest segment of the population [ citation needed ] . However,  Roman Catholic ,  Baptist ,  Methodist , and other  Christian  denominations also support congregations. The Christian population celebrates its deeply-rooted faith in an annual festival,  Gospelfest . Smaller  Jewish ,  Hindu , and  Muslim  communities add some religious diversity.   In addition to Gospelfest, Barbados holds many other carnivals and festivals. The  Landship  is a Barbadian tradition. It mimics and parodies the  Royal Navy , and incorporates music, dance and games. The largest and most important festival in Barbados is  Crop Over , which celebrates the end of the  sugarcane  harvest. Lasting three weeks, it includes fairs, parades, and contests.   The  music of Barbados  is an important part of the country's culture. Modern Barbados has produced popular stars of  calypso  and the indigenous  spouge  style, and also has a large  jazz  scene.  Reggae ,  soca , and  tuk  are popular as well.   Every January, Barbados hosts the  Barbados Jazz Festival . In mid-February, Barbados hosts the  Barbados Holetown Festival  which celebrates the arrival of the first English settlers.     [ edit ]   References     Millington, Janice (1999). ""Barbados"".

The island's vibrant culture and rich history come to life in its lively Bajan festivals, nightlife, and friendly people. Famous luxury resorts are a big draw, but you can also find fun in a local rum bar. And you can't beat the restaurants here, renowed as some of the best in the Caribbean. Barbados Basic Travel Information Location:  Easternmost of the Caribbean islands, in the West Indies north of Venezuela.  Size:  21 mi/34 km long, 14 mi/23 km wide.  Capital:  Bridgetown Language:  English Religions:  Protestant, Roman Catholic  Currency: Barbadian Dollar; U.S. dollar widely accepted. Telephone/Area Code:  246 Tipping : 10-15% Weather:  Dry season January-June; rainy season June-October; trade winds moderate tropical temperatures year-round. Barbados Tourism Authority Barbados Consular Information Sheet CIA Factbook: Barbados Barbados Attractions Cave tours, restored plantation homes, wildlife preserves, gardens and rum or cigar factory tours are just a sampling of Barbados' many and diverse attractions.  Bridgetown is a great city for strolling, and the island's many museums are a testiment to Bajans' proud history and sense of identity. Golf and watersports are popular, as are outback tours by horse, on foot, or on an ATV or 4x4. More Info on Barbados Attractions Barbados Beaches Surfers flock to Barbados' East Coast for big-wave action, while families prefer the calmer waters of the West Coast; beaches here are typically lined with resorts. Many of the South Coast beaches have reefs that invite snorkelers. For solitude, try Bottom Bay near Sam Lord's Castle. All beaches in Barbados are free and open to the public, but there's no nude sunbathing. More Info on Barbados Beaches Barbados Hotels and Resorts Barbados has a reputation as an upscale destination, so it's no surprise to find resorts from brands like Fairmont and Hilton among the big hotels. Sandy Lane is perhaps the most famous: Tiger Woods got married there. But while luxury dominates the west coast, moderately priced hotels, inns and guest houses can be found on the south coast and elsewhere. Barbados also has many luxury villas – luxury private homes that can be rented, even fully staffed. More Info on Barbados Hotels and Resorts Barbados All-Inclusive Resorts Barbados Restaurants Casual by day, island-sophisticated by night, Barbados' restaurant scene is typically mixed. One nice aspect: you can actually find an inexpensive meal, such as stands selling ""roti"" – pastries stuffed with spicy potatoes and meat. Flying fish and cou cou (a mash of corn meal and okra) are the national dishes,  found on the menu of Barbados' many local restaurants; the island also has an abundance of elegant eateries serving cuisine from around the world to Barbados' discriminating visitors. More Info on Barbados Restaurants Barbados Culture and History Barbados was settled by the British in 1627, and endured a slave-driven sugar plantation economy for 200 years. Sugar, molasses and rum are still parts of the economy, but tourism took the lead in the 1990s. Barbados won independence in 1966, although it remains part of the British Commonwealth. A mix of British stoicism and African-flavored joie de vivre typifies today's Barbados: the Bajan dialect you'll hear English spoken with is a perfect example of the mix. More Info on Barbados Culture & History Fun Barbados: Island Culture Barbados.org: History Barbados Events and Festivals The annual sugar-cane harvest was the original Crop-Over; today, Barbados' biggest festival runs three weeks spanning July and August, peaking with the annual Kadooment parade. The yearly Holetown Festival marks the first British settlement with a street fair and parade. Barbudian sophistication is evident at March's Holders Season, which brings in opera, Shakespeare, and other performing arts. The Cricket World Cup will be played here in 2007. More Info on Barbados Events and Festivals Barbados Nightlife Bridgetown is known as one of the nightlife capitals of the Caribbean. You'll find everything from big-city sized discos to open-air dance clubs and bars with local bands banging out reggae, calypso, soca and more. Dinner cruises also are popular, and a lingering dinner at one of the island's great restaurants is always a romantic option. St. Lawrence Gap in Christ Church has staged dinner shows, street parties, and a variety of nightclubs with live music.

Bridgetown was originally named ""Indian                       Bridge"" for the rude bridge which had been constructed                       over the river (now known as the Careenage) by the Indians.                       It was later called the ""town of St. Michael"" in official                       documents, before finally being named Bridgetown.                      The Chamberlain Bridge  was erected in 1872 and was a swing bridge operated by two persons, allowing entry into the inner basin of the Careenage. In 2006 the Chamberlain Bridge was replaced with a modern lift bridge.                     In previous                       times, the careenage was an important hub of                       activity for inter-island trading vessels. Nowadays the                       careenage is mainly utilized by  pleasure                       craft  ( catamarans , yachts,  fishing                       boats , etc).                                           Shopping                      Broad                       Street is the main street of Bridgetown and consists mainly                       of banks, department stores and duty free shops. Other                       streets in Bridgetown such as Swan Street, Roebuck Street                       and Tudor Street consist mainly of smaller shops and businesses,                       together with wayside vendors.

The Barbados Parliament was established                         in 1639 and is the third oldest Parliament in the entire                         Commonwealth.

""Trafalgar Square"" was officially renamed  National                         Heroes Square  in April 1999, in honour of the national                         heroes of Barbados.

The Continental Shelf   Most continents extend far beyond the point where ocean meets land. Their extended perimeter is referred to as the continental shelf. The ocean becomes very deep at the steep slope called the shelf break where the continental shelf ends and the abyssal plain, (or flat ocean floor) begins. Most shelves have a width of approximately 80 km and can measure anywhere between 30 m to 600 m in depth.   The largest shelf, the Siberian shelf in the Arctic Ocean, stretches 1,500 km wide. Another large shelf is found in the South China Sea called the Sundra shelf. This shelf joins Borneo, Sumatra, and Java to the Asian mainland. The North Sea and the Persian Gulf also contain shelves. Some geographical areas do not have a continental shelf. This common where the leading edge of moving oceanic plates is found beneath the continental crust. There are no shelves off the coast of Chile or the west coast of Sumatra.   Continental shelves are places of great biodiversity and marine life due to the relative abundance of sunlight available in their shallow waters. In contrast, the abyssal plain has been described as a biotic desert. Shelves eventually become a source of fossil fuels if oxygen poor conditions in sedimentary deposits continue over long periods of time.   The shelf is the most familiar and well-understood area of the ocean floor to humans due to its great diversity of life. Fish species that inhabit continental shelves are quickly becoming over exploited because it's more accessible than deep water species. Continental shelves are also valuable for oil and gas exploration. Consequently, marine nations claimed sovereign rights to their continental shelves in the Convention on the Continental Shelf created by the UN’s International Law Commission in 1958.   The law was partially overridden by the 1982 United States Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.   The Mid-Atlantic Ridge   The Mid-Atlantic ridge runs from Iceland to Antarctic and is the longest underwater mountain range on Earth. The ridge was formed by an oceanic rift separating the North American Plate from the Eurasian Plate in the North Atlantic Ocean. In the South Atlantic, the Mid-Atlantic ridge separates the South American Plate from the African Plate. The Mid-Atlantic ridge sits atop of the highest point of the mid-Atlantic rise, a bulge in the ocean floor where upward convective forces in the asthenosphere push up the oceanic crust and lithosphere. The discovery of the Mid-Atlantic ridge in the 1950’s by Bruce Heezen led to the theory of seafloor spreading and the acceptance of Wegener’s theory of continental drift. The Mid-Atlantic ridge runs along plates that become increasingly more separated according to plate tectonics, a theory developed to explain continental drift.   There is constant movement in the ocean floor due to tectonic plates shifting, submerging deeper, or, as in the case of the Mid-Atlantic ridge, moving away from each other. In the area left behind, new crust is created when magma pushes up from the mantle. The rate of spreading is about 2.5 centimeters per year or 25 km in one million years. Although this rate is relatively slow to humans, in terms of geologic years the plates have moved thousands of kilometers. A good example of seafloor spreading is the Atlantic Ocean, which has transformed from a small inlet between Europe, Africa, and the Americas into the enormous ocean it is today (»  read more ).   Plate Tectonics   The theory of plate tectonics is that plates make up the outer layer of the Earth and have slowly moved long distances throughout the history. This theory explains how the continents once fit together in a single continent called Pangaea. The movement of contintents explains how animals became separated onto different continents, and it explains how mountains, volcanoes, and ocean trenches were formed, and why earthquakes occur. The underlying theory behind plate tectonics is that the force of gravity is stronger on a heavy, cooled ocean floor than it is on a hotter and lighter floor. The boundaries at which plate tectonics occur are: convergent boundaries, divergent boundaries, collisional boundaries, and transform boundaries. Crust is formed at divergent boundaries and consumed at convergent boundaries. Crustal plates collide at collisional boundaries and slide against each other at transitional boundaries.   »  http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aso/tryit/tectonics/intro.html   The theory of plate tectonics came about in the 1960s to explain seafloor spreading and continental drift. Around 1915 a scientist named Alfred Wegener published the first edition of ""The Origin of Continents and Oceans"" in which he proposed that the shapes of the east coast of South America and the west coast of Africa indicate that may have been attached at some point in history.   In 1962, American geologist Harry Hess suggested that, instead of continents moving through the ocean crust, an entire ocean basin and its connected continent actually moved together as a plate. Once the theory of plate tectonics was accepted, a multitude of questions were explained and a scientific revolution occurred in geophysics and geology.   Other scientific phenomena were explained by plate tectonics as well, such as how the collisions of converging plates had enough force to lift the sea floor into thinner atmospheres.   »  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics   The Science of Plate Tectonics   Tectonic plates are solid bodies of rock floating on top of the asthenosphere, an area that is partially molten. The plates themselves are what make up the lithosphere, which is the Earth’s crust and the solid portion of the upper mantle. The lithosphere is cooler, heavier, and more rigid than the athenosphere and is made up of seven large plates including: the African plate, the Antarctic plate, the Australian plate, the Eurasianplate, the North American plate, the South American plate, and the Pacific plate.   »  http://scign.jpl.nasa.gov/learn/plate3.htm   Continental crust and oceanic crust behave differently due to their varying composition, so scientists named two types of lithosphere: the continental lithosphere and the oceanic lithosphere. Oceanic lithospheres are denser than continental lithospheres due to the high mafic mineral content in the ocean.   The Details of Plate Boundaries   As mentioned above, plates move in four different ways: convergent, divergent, collisional, and transform boundaries. As these moving plates meet along their boundaries, earthquakes are caused and volcanoes, mountains, and oceanic trenches are formed.   Convergent boundaries  occur where two plates slide towards each other and form a subduction zone, where plates slide underneath each other or an orogenic belt (a.k.a. collisional boundary) where plates simply collide and compress. When a dense oceanic plate collides with a less-dense continental plate, the oceanic plate is usually pushed underneath forming a subduction zone where the ocean floor looks like an oceanic trench on the ocean side and a mountain on the continental side. A subduction zone is found on the western coast of South America where the oceanic Nazca Plate is in the process of subduction beneath the continental South American Plate. The continental spine of South America is dense with volcanoes. These volcanoes are formed by the transfer and heating (by friction) of organic material from the bottom, a process that releases many dissolved gases that can erupt to the surface.   Another example is the Cascade mountain range in North America, which extends north from California’s Sierra Nevada. Volcanoes such as these are known for long periods of quiet and episodic eruptions starting with the expulsion of explosive gas containing fine particles of glassy volcanic ash and spongy cinders. A rebuilding of the pressure with hot magma follows this phase. The Pacific Ocean is completely surrounded by volcanoes; hence it is called The Pacific Ring of Fire. Crumpling of both plates or compression of one plate occurs when two continental plates collide and one overrides the other. For example, the Himalayas were formed when an Indian subcontinental plate was thrust under part of the Eurasian plate. In Japan, it is common to see two oceanic plates converging to form an island arc as one plate is subducted under the other plate.   Divergent boundaries occur where two plates slide apart. The space created here is filled up with crust newly brought up from molten magma below. The East African Great Rift Valley is an example of a rift formed by a divergent boundary. Divergent boundaries most likely form at hotspots where convective cells bring large quantities of molten material from the asthenosphere up and there is enough kinetic energy to break through the lithosphere. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is thought to have come from a hotspot that widens a few centimeters every century. Hotspots may be a future source of energy as they are thought to be an abundant source of hydrogen. Countries like Iceland are actively researching geothermal energy as a source for the world’s first hydrogen economy.   Fracture zones or fault zones in the oceanic ridge system are created by divergent boundaries due to a non-uniform rate of spreading. These fracture zones result in many submarine earthquakes and appear on a map as patterns divided by lines perpendicular to the ridge line. (»  read more ). The patterns are caused by a conveyor belt motion away from the center of divergence.   A major piece of evidence supporting the theory of sea-floor spreading was found at the mid-ocean ridges when airborne geomagnetic surveys revealed an odd pattern of symmetrical polar magnetic reversals on opposite sides of the center of each ridge. These reversals corresponded directly with the Earth’s polar reversals and the theory that the sea floor moves in huge plates was confirmed. Additional evidence was supplied by measuring the ages of rocks in each band. With all the evidence combined it was obvious that huge plates moved away from each other and collided. With the new information it was even possible to create a detailed map of the rate of spreading.   Transform boundaries are formed when plates grind past each other along transform faults. Huge plates grinding past each other cause immense friction and the effects of the stress build-up are highly visible. With transform boundaries, stress builds up in both plates until they reach the slipping point where the built up potential energy is released in the form of a motion along the fault line. In many cases this energy becomes an earthquake. The San Andreas Fault is an example of a transform boundary where the movement of the Pacific and North American plates builds potential energy released in the form of earthquakes.    The Movement of Oceanic Plates   Tectonic plates are able to move because they float on the relatively fluid asthenosphere. The source of energy for the movement of tectonic plates is thought to be the loss or dissipation of heat from the mantle of the Earth. Dissipation of heat from the mantle is converted into two forces, the force of friction and the force of gravity.   The transmission of convection currents in the mantle through the asthenosphere is driven by the force of friction occurring between the asthenosphere and the lithosphere known as mantle drag. Trench suction occurs when local convention currents pull plates at subduction zones and ocean trenches downward with the force of friction.   Gravity is another force in the movement of tectonic plates. There are several different types of plate motion caused by gravity including ridge-push plate motion and slab-pull plate motion. With ridge-push plate motion plates at oceanic ridges are higher in elevation and are prone to sliding down due to the force of gravity. The name is actually not representative of what is actually happening, since there is no pushing going on but rather the sliding down of plates. The underlying cause of motion is upwelling from the convection occurring in the mantle, and this is what triggers the sliding of plates. Slab-pull plate motion is the other gravitational force and is the result of cold, dense plates sinking into the mantle at places where there is a trench.   Convection   The idea that convection, or the circulation of liquid or gas, occurs within the mantle is supported by strong scientific evidence. Scientists are almost certain that the upwelling of materials particularly around the mid-ocean ridges is caused by convection. It is still not clear what forces move tectonic plates. At first, it was thought that the force of friction between the asthenosphere and the lithosphere was key and that plates sit on top of huge convection cells like conveyor belts. As more data was gathered it became clear that the force of friction was not significant enough to drive the motion of tectonic plates alone. Now it is thought that slab-pull is the strongest force and trench suction follows closely in significance.   The Movement of Plates   Over long periods of time, geologic in scale (approx. every 500 million years), supercontinents form and break up. The oldest-known supercontinent known as Rodinia formed approximately a billion years ago and was the starting material for all the Earth's continents. About 750 million years ago, this supercontinent broke up into eight different continents which then formed two supercontinents called Laurasia (North America, Europe and Siberia/Asia) and Gondwana (China, India, Africa, South America, and Antarctica) about 350 million years ago which then reassembled about 275 million years ago to form what is known as the supercontinent Pangaea. Tectonic forces then began breaking Pangaea apart which continues today. The Earth is not the only planet where plate tectonics can occur. It is thought from observations made in 1999 of the magnetic fields of Mars by the Global Surveyor spacecraft that plate tectonics may have once been at work on Mars.          Hydrothermal Vents   Hydrothermal vents are fractures (cracks) in Earth’s surface where geothermally-heated water pulses through. Usually, a hydrothermal vent is found where hot magma is close to the surface crust as in volcanically active locations. The Earth has quite a few geothermal vents due to its geologically active nature and the vast amount of water present at the surface. Hot springs, fumaroles, and geysers are all examples of geothermal vents on land. Yellowstone National Park in the United States is home to a spectacular display of hydrothermal vents.   Hydrothermal vents in the ocean floor are called submarine hydrothermal vents or black smokers and were discovered in 1977 around the Galapagos Islands by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration using a small submersible called Alvin. They are usually hundreds of meters wide and are formed when water heated geothermally to extreme temperatures (up to 400 °C)rises through the ocean floor. The water never boils because of the extreme pressure it is under at that depth. They contain many dissolved minerals like sulfides that usually crystallize into a chimney-shaped structure. The black color comes from the precipitation of minerals when the cold ocean water and the superheated water collide. These black smokers exist in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans usually at about 2,100 meters in depth.   The areas around black smokers contain entire complex communities of bioorganisms who survive using chemicals dissolved in the fluids of the vents. These waters are too deep for sunlight to penetrate, so the vent communities rely on chemosynthesis instead of photosynthesis where heat, methane, and sulfur compounds are converted into energy. At the base of the food chain are chemosynthetic organisms that support entire communities of giant tubeworms, clams, and shrimp. Other planets that may have hydrothermal vents are Mars and Europa.   »  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrothermal_vent   Fascinating new species are always being discovered in and around black smokers. The Pompeii worm (Alvinella pompejana) is an animal living exclusively in hydrothermal vents of the Pacific Ocean. This worm was discovered in the early 1980’s by French researchers and is known now to be the “hottest animal on Earth” and an example of an extremophile (or an animal that can live in these extreme environments). In 2001, an  armor-plated gastropod, still un-named, was discovered during an expedition to the Indian Ocean’s Kairei hydrothermal vent field. This animal utilizes pyrite and greigite, iron sulfide compounds, to build it’s hardened body parts instead of the usual calcium carbonate. The armor plating is most likely used to defend the animal from predatory snails with huge teeth in the same area. It is thought that iron sulfide is stabilized by the extreme pressure of 2,500 meters ocean water allowing the compound to be used by bioorganisms.   »  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompeii_worm   The Lost City   In December 2000, a series of hydrothermal vents were discovered during a National Science Foundation expedition to the mid-Atlantic ocean that are very different from the black smoker hydrothermal vents found in the 1970s. A subsequent expedition in 2003 used Alvin to explore these vents and the details of data recovered were published in March 2005. What is being called The Lost City is a series of vents located on the seafloor mountain Atlantis Massif, where hydrogen rich fluids and methane are produced by reactions between seawater and the upper mantle peridotite. The fluid produced here is highly basic (pH 9-11) with temperatures that range from 40° to 90° Celsius. The Lost City consists of about 30 chimneys composed of calcium carbonate and standing 30-60 meters tall in addition to many smaller chimneys.   The vents found at the Lost City release methane and hydrogen into the ocean water and in contrast to black smokers, they do not release a lot of carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide or metals. The Lost City is also much older than black smoker vents, an observation made possible using strontium, carbon and oxygen isotopic data and radiocarbon ages to document 30,000 years of hydrothermal activity. Consequently, organisms living in Lost City vents are completely different from those living near black smokers, hence Lost City vents do not contain a lot of chemosynthetic microorganisms found near volcanically driven black smokers. The animals that do live near Lost City vents consist of small invertebrates with carbonate structures like snails, bivalves, polychaetes, amphipods and ostracods. Microorganisms living here include: Methanosarcina-like archaea and bacteria related to the Firmicutes. In addition to the variety of scientifically interesting chemosynthetic organisms supported by black smokers, the Lost City provides scientists with a model of an ecosystem driven by abiotic methane and hydrogen. A large portion of scientific research into whether life exists on other planets, relies on the study of extremophiles here on Earth.   »  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_City_(hydrothermal_field)   Cold Seeps   A cold seep is a vent that is not superheated but hydrogen sulfide, methane and hydrocarbon-rich fluid still seep out into the surrounding water. The reactions between seawater and methane create carbonate rock formations and reefs over time. Cold seeps do not work in short, unpredictable bursts like many hydrothermal vents but are instead slow and dependable.   Light independent organisms exist in entire communities in and around cold seeps. The organisms that live in cold seeps usually live longer than those at hydrothermal vents due to the relative stability of resources. The longest lived noncolonial invertebrate is a cold seep tubeworm that lives from 170-250 years. Most of the organisms living in cold seeps are reliant on a symbiotic (each benefits from the other) relationship with chemoautotrophic bacteria, organisms that process sulfides and methane through chemosynthesis into chemical energy. The chemoautotrophic bacteria are classified into archaea and eubacteria and power the lives of larger organisms like vesicomyid clams and vestimentiferan tubeworms. In exchange, the clams and tubeworms provide a safe haven for the bacteria and also a source of food. The entire structure and formation of the reefs and rock formations could be dependent on bacterial reactions. The strategy of some bacteria in cold seeps is to create mats, covering the ocean floor. One example is the beggiatoal bacterial mat in Blake Ridge, off the coast of South Carolina.   Dr. Charles Paull is credited with the discovery of cold seeps in 1984 in the Monterey Canyon off of Monterey Bay, California. The first cold seep was discovered at a depth of 3,200 meters, although the deepest cold seep found is located in the Sea of Japan at a depth of 5000-6500 meters. Since then, cold seeps have been found in the Gulf of Mexico, the Sea of Japan, and in water off Alaska’s coast.   »  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_seep   The Ocean  /  NEXT: Marine Zones » Feedback?  |  [Edit Content]       Sharks & Rays  |  Fishes  |  Squid & Octopuses  |  Reptiles  |  Birds  |  Seals & Sea lions+  |  Whales & Dolphins       Join the MarineBio Society  |   Partners & Sponsors  |  Frontline Marine Conservation  |  Volunteers  |  Help Make a Difference  |  MarineBio Blog  |  For Funders  |  For Scientists  |  For Students  |     The Plankton Forums   Marine Conservation :  A Sea Ethic  |  Marine Conservation Biology  |  Global Warming/Climate Change  |  Sustainable Fisheries  |  Biodiversity  |  Threatened & Endangered Species   Habitat Conservation  |  Alien Species  |  Ocean Dumping Grounds  |  Ocean Resources  |  Sustainable/Eco-Tourism  |  Marine Conservation Organizations   Essays on Wildlife Conservation  |  Marine Conservation Forum  |  The Future   The Ocean/Marine Science :   Marine Life 101  |  Tools & Methods  |  Relevant Journals  |  MarineBio Downloads   Aquariums  |  Creature Quiz  |  MarineBio Kids  |  Fun Ocean Facts  |  Ocean Mysteries  |  Scuba Diving  |  Submarines/Tech  |  Marine Life News  |  MarineBio Resource Directory  |  Books & DVDs+   Education Resources  |  U.S. Colleges  |  International  |  Institutes & Labs  |  Career Resources   About Us  |  What's New?  |  Press  |  MarineBio Projects  |  Expeditions  |  Contributors  |  Contact MarineBio  |  FAQs  |  Site Map           ~ Sharing the wonders of the ocean to inspire  conservation ,  education ,  research , and a  sea ethic  ~  MarineBio.org, Inc. is a US 501(c)(3) tax exempt organization.

Barbados  ( Portuguese  word for  bearded-ones , pronounced  /bQrbejdoz, -dRs/ ), [ 2 ]  situated just east of the  Caribbean Sea , is an independent  Continental Island - nation  in the western  Atlantic Ocean . Located at roughly 13 North of the  equator  and 59 West of the  prime meridian , it is considered a part of the  Lesser Antilles . Its closest island neighbours are  Saint Vincent & the Grenadines  and  Saint Lucia  to the west. To the south lies  Trinidad and Tobago with which Barbados now shares a fixed official maritime boundaryand also the  South American  mainland. Barbados's total land area is about 430 square kilometres (166 square miles), and is primarily low-lying, with some higher regions in the country's interior. The highest point in Barbados is  Mount Hillaby  in the parish of Saint Andrew. The geological composition of Barbados is of non-volcanic origin and is predominantly composed of  limestone - coral  formed by subduction of the South American plate colliding with the Caribbean plate. The island's climate is  tropical , with constant  trade winds  off the Atlantic Ocean serving to keep temperatures mild. Some less developed areas of the country contain tropical woodland and  mangroves . Other parts of the interior which contribute to the agriculture industry are dotted with large  sugarcane  estates and wide, gently sloping  pastures , with panoramic views down to the coast also.   Barbados's  human development index  ranking is consistently among the top 75 countries in the world. For example, in 2006, it was ranked 31st in the world, and third in the Americas, behind  Canada  and the  United States .

The origin of the name ""Barbados"" is controversial. The  Portuguese , en route to  Brazil  are credited as the first Europeans to discover and name the island. It is a matter of conjecture whether the word ""bearded"" refers to the long, hanging roots of the bearded fig-tree ( Ficus citrifolia ), indigenous to the island, to bearded  Caribs  inhabiting the island, or to the foam spraying over the outlying reefs giving the impression of a beard. In 1519, a map produced by the Genoese mapmaker Vesconte de Maggiola showed and named Barbados in its correct position southeast of the island of  Dominica .   Another name associated with Barbados or her people is ""Bim"" or ""Bimshire"". The origin is uncertain but several theories abound, the  National Cultural Foundation  of Barbados follows the Dr.  Richard Allsopp  theory, which is that ""Bim"" was a word commonly used by slaves and that it derives from the phrase ""bi mu"" [ 3 ]  or either (""bem"", ""Ndi bem"", ""Nwanyi ibem"" or ""Nwoke ibem"") [ 4 ]  from an  Igbo  phrase, meaning ""my people."" In colloquial or literary contexts, ""Bim"" can also take a more deific tone, referring to the ""goddess"" Barbados. [ citation needed ]  The word Bim and Bimshire are recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary and the Chamber's Twentieth Century Dictionaries. Another possible source for ""Bim"" is reported to be in the Agricultural Reporter of 25 April 1868, The Rev. N Greenidge (father of one of the island's most famous scholars, Abel Hendy Jones Greenidge) suggested the listing of Bimshire as a county of England. Expressly named were ""Wiltshire, Hampshire, Berkshire, and Bimshire"". [ 5 ]  Lastly in the Daily Argosy (of Demerara i.e. Guyana) of 1652 it referred to Bim as a possible corruption of the word "" Byam "", who was a Royalist leader against the Parliamentarians. That source suggested the followers of Byam became known as Bims and became a word for all Barbadians. [ 6 ]     [ edit ]   Early history   The first indigenous people are thought to be  Amerindians  who arrived from  Venezuela  around approximately 350-400 B.C. The  Arawak  people were the second wave of migrants, arriving from South America around 800. In the thirteenth century, the Caribs arrived from South America in the third wave, displacing both the Arawak and the Salodoid-Barrancoid culture. For the next few centuries, the Caribs  like the Arawak and the Salodoid-Barrancoid  lived in isolation on the island.   The  Portuguese  then briefly claimed Barbados from the mid-1500s to the 1600s; and may have seized the indigenous  Caribs  on Barbados and used them as  slave labour . Other Caribs are believed to have fled the island to neighbouring islands. Apart from possibly displacing the Caribs, the Portuguese left little impact and by the 1610s, they left for South America, leaving the island uninhabited.     [ edit ]   British colonial rule   British sailors who landed on Barbados in 1625 arrived at the site of present-day  Holetown . At the time it was inhabited only by natives who descended from those left behind by the Portuguese. From the arrival of the first British settlers in 16271628 until independence in 1966, Barbados was under uninterrupted British control. Nevertheless, Barbados always enjoyed a large measure of local autonomy. Its  House of Assembly  began meeting in 1639. Among the initial important British figures was Sir  William Courten .   With the increased implementation of slave codes, which created differential treatment between Africans and the white workers and planters, the island became increasingly unattractive to poor whites. Black or slave codes were implemented in 1661, 1676, 1682, and 1688. In response to these codes, several slave rebellions were attempted or planned during this time, but none succeeded. However, an increasingly repressive legal system caused the gap between the treatment of typically white indentured servants and black slaves to widen. Imported slaves became much more attractive for the rich planters who would increasingly dominate the island not only economically but also politically. Some have speculated that, because the Africans could withstand tropical diseases and the climate much better than the white slave population, the white population decreased. This is inconsistent with the fact that many poor whites simply migrated to neighbouring islands and remained in tropical climates. Nevertheless, poor whites who had or acquired the means to emigrate often did so. Planters expanded their importation of African slaves to cultivate sugar cane. The Barbados turned from mainly English and Scots-Irish in the seventeenth century to overwhelmingly black by the end of the 18th century.   Barbados eventually had one of the world's biggest sugar industries after Jews from Brazil introduced the sugarcane to the island in the mid 1600s. This quickly replaced  tobacco  plantations on the islands which were previously the main export. As the  sugar  industry developed into its main commercial enterprise, Barbados was divided into large plantation estates that replaced the smallholdings of the early British settlers. Some of the displaced farmers moved to other British colonies in the Americas, most notably  North  and  South Carolina , and  British Guiana , as well as  Panama . To work the plantations, planters imported enslaved West Africans to Barbados and other Caribbean islands.   The British abolished the  slave trade  in 1807 but not the institution itself. In 1816, slaves arose in the largest major slave rebellion in the island's history. Twenty thousand slaves from over seventy plantations rebelled. They drove whites off the plantations, but widespread killings did not take place. This was later termed Bussa's Rebellion after the slave ranger Bussa, who with his assistants hated slavery, found the treatment of slaves on Barbados to be intolerable, and believed the political climate in the UK made the time ripe to peacefully negotiate with planters for freedom (Davis, p. 211; Northrup, p. 191). Bussa's Rebellion failed. One hundred and twenty slaves died in combat or were immediately executed; another 144 were brought to trial and executed; remaining rebels were shipped off the island (Davis, pp. 212-213).   Slavery was finally abolished in the British Empire eighteen years later in 1834. In Barbados and the rest of the British West Indian colonies, full emancipation from slavery was preceded by an apprenticeship period that lasted four years.          Statue of  Lord Nelson  in  National Heroes Square  which predates the more famous  Nelson's Column  by some 27 years.       In 1884, the Barbados Agricultural Society sent a letter to  Sir Francis Hincks  requesting his private and public views on whether the Dominion of Canada would favourably entertain having the then colony of Barbados admitted as a member of the Canadian Confederation. Asked of  Canada  were the terms of the Canadian side to initiate discussions, and whether or not the island of Barbados could depend on the full influence of Canada in getting the change agreed to by the  United Kingdom . Then in 1952 the  Barbados Advocate  newspaper polled several prominent Barbadian politicians, lawyers, businessmen, the Speaker of the  Barbados House of Assembly  and later as first President of the  Senate , Sir Theodore Branker , Q.C. and found them to be in favour of immediate federation of Barbados along with the rest of the British  Caribbean  with complete Dominion Status within five years from the date of inauguration of the  West Indies Federation  with Canada.   However, plantation owners and merchants of British descent still dominated local politics, owing to the high income qualification required for voting. More than 70% of the population, many of them disenfranchised women, were excluded from the democratic process. It was not until the 1930s that the descendants of emancipated slaves began a movement for political rights. One of the leaders of this movement,  Sir Grantley Adams , founded the  Barbados Labour Party  in 1938, then known as the Barbados Progressive League. A staunch supporter of the monarchy, Adams and his party demanded more rights for the poor and for the people. Progress toward a more democratic government in Barbados was made in 1942, when the exclusive income qualification was lowered and women were given the right to vote. By 1949 governmental control was wrested from the planters and, in 1958, Adams became Premier of Barbados.   From 1958 to 1962, Barbados was one of the ten members of the  West Indies Federation , an organisation doomed by nationalistic attitudes and by the fact that its members, as British colonies, held limited legislative power. Adams served as its first and only ""Premier"", but his leadership failed in attempts to form similar unions, and his continued defence of the monarchy was used by his opponents as evidence that he was no longer in touch with the needs of his country.  Errol Walton Barrow , a fervent reformer, became the new people's advocate. Barrow had left the BLP and formed the  Democratic Labour Party  as a liberal alternative to Adams' conservative government. Barrow instituted many progressive social programmes, such as free education for all Barbadians, and the School Meals system. By 1961, Barrow had replaced Adams as Premier and the DLP controlled the government.   With the Federation dissolved, Barbados had reverted to its former status, that of a  self-governing colony . The island negotiated its own independence at a constitutional conference with the United Kingdom in June 1966. After years of peaceful and democratic progress, Barbados finally became an independent state on 30 November 1966, with Errol Barrow its first Prime Minister. Upon independence Barbados maintained historical linkages with Britain by establishing membership to the  Commonwealth of Nations  grouping, a year later Barbados' International linkages were expanded by obtaining membership to the  United Nations  and the  Organization of American States .     [ edit ]   Government and politics          Parliamentary building.           Main articles:  Politics of Barbados  and  Monarchy of Barbados       Barbados has been an independent country since 30 November 1966. It functions as a  constitutional monarchy  and  parliamentary democracy , modeled on the British  Westminster system , with  Elizabeth II ,  Queen of Barbados , as  head of state  represented locally by the  Governor-General ,  Clifford Husbands  and the  Prime Minister  as the  head of the government . Its  Parliament  comprises thirty seats. It has been proposed that Barbados become a  republic  with a  president  replacing the  Barbadian sovereign ; this issue is still being debated, as the island has been stable and governmentally autonomous for decades.   Barbados is a full and participating member of the  Caribbean Community  (CARICOM), the  Caribbean (CARICOM) Single Market and Economy  (CSME), the  Caribbean Court of Justice  (CCJ), which pertains only to Barbados and  Guyana  but is expected to replace the UK  Privy Council  for the entire English-speaking Caribbean eventually, and the  Association of Caribbean States  (ACS). [ 7 ]   Barbados has a two party system, the two dominant parties being the ruling  Democratic Labour Party  and the  Barbados Labour Party . The Barbados Labour Party (BLP) had been in government for fifteen years, since 1993 until the 2008 general election. Under this administration, the Former Prime Minister, The Right Honourable Owen S. Arthur also acted as the Regional Leader of the CSM (Caribbean Single Market). The Right Honorable David Thompson is the Prime Minister of Barbados. [ 8 ]   On 11 April 2006, the 5-Member  UNCLOS  Annex VII Arbitral Tribunal, presided over by H.E. Judge  Stephen M. Schwebel , rendered after two years of international judicial proceedings, the landmark Barbados/Trinidad and Tobago Award, which resolved the maritime boundary delimitation (in the East, Central and West sectors) to satisfaction of both Parties and committed Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago to resolve their fisheries dispute by means of concluding a new Fisheries Agreement.     [ edit ]   Geography and climate of Barbados          Map of Barbados              Beach near  Bridgetown , Barbados.       Barbados is extremly small for a Caribbean island. Relatively flat, it rises gently to the central highland region, the highest point being  Mount Hillaby , in the Scotland District, at 340 meters (1,100 ft) above sea level. The island is located in the Atlantic Ocean, to the east of the other Caribbean islands. The  climate  is tropical, with a rainy season from June to October.   Barbados is often spared the worst effects of the region's tropical storms and  hurricanes  during the rainy season as its far eastern location in the Atlantic Ocean puts it just outside the principal hurricane strike zone, and a hurricane hits about every 26 years. The last significant hit from a hurricane to cause severe damage to Barbados was  Hurricane Janet  in 1955.   In the parish of  Saint Michael  lies Barbados' capital and main city,  Bridgetown . Locally Bridgetown is sometimes referred to as ""The City"", but the most common reference is simply ""Town"". Other towns scattered across the island include  Holetown , in the parish of  Saint James ;  Oistins , in the parish of  Christ Church , and Speightstown, in the parish of  Saint Peter .   It is geologically composed of coral (90 m/300 ft thick). The land falls in a series of ""terraces"" in the west and goes into an incline in the east. Most of Barbados is circled by coral reefs.   The climate is moderate tropical with two seasons: dry and wet. The dry season (DecemberMay) and wet season (JuneNovember) gives an annual rainfall of 40-90 inches (1,0002,300 mm).     [ edit ]   Parishes       Main article:  Parishes of Barbados              Map of the parishes of Barbados       Barbados is  divided  into eleven administrative  parishes :     Christ Church   Saint Andrew   Saint George   Saint James   Saint John   Saint Joseph   Saint Lucy   Saint Michael   Saint Peter   Saint Philip   Saint Thomas       [ edit ]   Economy       Main article:  Economy of Barbados       Historically, the economy of Barbados had been dependent on  sugarcane  cultivation and related activities, but in recent years it has diversified into the  manufacturing  and  tourism  sectors. Offshore finance and information services have become important foreign exchange earners, and there is a healthy light manufacturing sector. In recent years the Government has been seen as business-friendly and economically sound. Since the late 1990s the island has seen a construction boom, with the development and redevelopment of hotels, office complexes, and homes.   The government continues its efforts to reduce  unemployment , encourage direct foreign investment, and privatize remaining state-owned enterprises. Unemployment has been reduced from around 14 percent in the past to under 10 percent.          Circulating  coins  2006       The economy contracted in 2001 and 2002 due to slowdowns in tourism, consumer spending and the impact of the  September 11, 2001 attacks , but rebounded in 2003 and has shown growth since 2004. Traditional trading partners include Canada, the  Caribbean Community  (especially  Trinidad and Tobago ), the United Kingdom and the United States.   Business links and investment flows have become substantial: as of 2003 the island saw from Canada  C$ 25 billion in investment holdings, placing it as one of Canada's top five destinations for Canadian  Foreign Direct Investment  (FDI). Businessman  Eugene Melnyk  of  Toronto , Canada, is said to be Barbados' richest permanent resident.   It was thought by key Barbadian industry sources that the year 2006 would have been one of the busiest years for building construction ever in Barbados, as the building-boom on the island entered the final stages for several multi-million dollar projects. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Transport       Main article:  Transport in Barbados       Transport on the island is good, with 'route taxis', called ""ZR's"" (pronounced "" Zed -Rs"" not ""Zee-Rs""), travelling to most points on the island. These small buses can at times be crowded, as passengers are generally never turned down, regardless of the their amount. However, they will usually take the more scenic routes to destinations. They generally depart from the capital  Bridgetown  or from  Speightstown  in the northern part of the island.          A  Mini Moke  at  Speightstown  beach       The island of Barbados's lone airport is the  Sir Grantley Adams International Airport (GAIA)  ( IATA  identifier  BGI ). It receives daily flights by several major airlines from points around the globe, as well as several smaller regional commercial airlines and charters. The airport serves as the main air-transportation hub for the Eastern Caribbean. It is undergoing a US$100 million upgrade and expansion.   There are three bus systems running seven days a week (though less frequently on Sundays), and a ride on any of them costs $1.50 BBD. The smaller buses from the two privately-owned systems (""ZRs"" and ""minibuses"") can give change; the larger blue and yellow buses from the government-operated  Barbados Transport Board  system cannot. Most routes require a connection in Bridgetown. Some drivers within the competitive privately owned systems are reluctant to advise persons to use competing services, even if those would be more suitable.   Some hotels also provide visitors with shuttles to points of interest on the island from outside the hotel lobby. The island also has plentin their native country). There are several locally-owned and -operated vehicle rental agencies in Barbados but there are no multi-national car-rental agencies such as Avis, Europcar or Hertz.   There is also a helicopter shuttle service, which offers air taxi services to a number of sites around the island, mainly on the West Coast tourist belt. Air and water traffic is regulated by the  Barbados Port Authority .     [ edit ]   Tourist information   The island is well developed, and there are internationally known hotels offering world-class accommodation. Time-shares are available, and many of the smaller local hotels and private villas which dot the island have space available if booked in advance. The southern and western coasts of Barbados are popular, with the calm light blue Atlantic Ocean and their fine white and pinkish sandy beaches. Along the island's east coast the Atlantic Ocean side are tumbling waves which are perfect for light  surfing , but a little bit risky due to under-tow currents.   Shopping  districts are popular in Barbados, with ample duty-free shopping. There is also a festive night-life in mainly tourist areas such as the  Saint Lawrence Gap . Other attractions include wildlife reserves, jewellery stores,  scuba diving , helicopter rides,  golf ,  festivals  (the largest being the annual crop over festival July/Aug), sightseeing, cave exploration, exotic  drinks  and fine  clothes   shopping .     [ edit ]   Attractions, landmarks and points of interest   Tourism accounts for almost one half of the economy.

Rory’s Tip  This is the transition time for the urban lakes: they will be stocked this coming week with catfish, but trout fishing is still viable  especially at first and last light. All the participating Urban Fishing Program lakes and ponds in the Phoenix and Tucson areas will be stocked with 15-20 inch channel catfish on Thursday, March 22.   Catfish will be stocked on an every other week basis through June.  Nearly 14,000 pounds of Arkansas farm raised catfish will be delivered and stocked into 19 Urban Fishing Program lakes each time.   For the warmwater lakes, the weather is heating up and so is the bass and crappie action. Roosevelt, Alamo, Bartlett and Pleasant and the hot spots. Topock Gorge near Lake Havasu is another good bet. Dont forget the sun block.   This is the leading edge of the largemouth bass spawn. Not all bass spawn at the same time. In fact, the spawn can extend from now through June depending on weather and other factors. Right now, you can expect to find some bass in the shallows, a segment of the bass population staging for the spawn, yet other bass remaining in their deep winter holding patterns.   During the early spawn, look for bedding bass in the backs of coves, typically adjacent to cover in a sheltered spot. For staging bass, try the major points outside the coves in 15 to 25 feet of water, and along secondary points inside the coves, along submerged creek channels or arroyos in the coves, and at the leading edge of major flats, especially along drop-offs.   If you can hook up with bedding bass or staging bass, try for bass holding in winter patterns, typically 25 to 35 feet deep. Submerged humps can be especially attractive for bass (especially larger ones) that are slowly coming out of their winter lethargy.   During the spawn, conscientious anglers will typically practice catch-and-release.    We havent received reports of spawning crappies yet, but with this spat of warm weather, it should not be long now, especially at Alamo. I would not be surprised if anglers found crappies on beds at Alamo this weekend. Crappies will typically stage at the mouths of coves, or just inside the coves. Try mini-jigs or live minnows. For retrieves, think s-l-o-w and/or stop-and-go. One angler at Bartlett loaded up with crappies fishing from the dock using a slip bobber and minnows.   In the high country, we havent heard much about the Mogollon Rim lakes but the lakes in the Show Low area  such as Fool Hollow, Show Low Lake, Scotts Reservoir, Woodland, and Rainbow  are apparently ice free and mostly over flowing.   Some good high country spots to try right now are Silver Creek near Show Low for Apache trout, Becker Lake near Springerville for rainbow trout and Nelson Reservoir near Springerville for rainbows and browns.   If this warm weather continues, we might have early access to the higher elevation trout lakes, but with our unpredictable weather patterns, who knows. It would be nice to get another storm or two. We could sure use the moisture.   In the mid-elevation range, this is a good time to visit Deadhorse Lake State Park and the Verde River between Cottonwood and Camp Verde and fish for stocked rainbow trout. Oak Creek in the upper reaches of Oak Creek Canyon might be a good bet for trout as well. Goldwater Lake near Prescott (take Senator Highway toward Groom Creek) was also stocked recently.   But if you want to stay close to home and have a great trout fishing experience, visit the Lower Salt River below Stewart Mountain Dam (Saguaro Lake). We stocked last week at the Water Users (look for a huge parking lot along Bush Highway) and at Blue Point. Tempe Town Lake also received trout stockings throughout the winter, but expect a first- and last-light bite. However, the bass fishing at Tempe Town Lake is coming on strong.   In southern Arizona, Patagonia and Pena Blanca lakes were stocked this week with trout. This is the transition time when you can catch trout and bass.   Good luck. Maybe Ill see you out there.   Fishing News  Alamo Lake Cleanup is a windy success!  The recent Alamo Lake clean up was a windy but clean success  — despite a windy cold front, 95 volunteers scoured the wildlife area and filled two dump trucks full of trash.   Stewart Kohnke, the Alamo Lake wildlife manager who coordinated  the event, said the remarkable effort was accomplished thanks to volunteers who put in 900 hours of effort and came from as far away as Yuma and Bullhead City.   “People are more apt to keep a campsite clean if they find it clean, Kohnke said. This year we had more people and picked up less trash from around the lake proving that volunteers can make a difference.”   Volunteers included members from Wickenburgs High Desert Juniors Bass Club; Yuma Valley Rod and Gun Club; Prescott Audubon Society; and local residents from the Wayside Inn.   Workers were treated to a free door prize raffle with items ranging from fishing equipment to free dinners. Prizes were donated by the Yuma Valley Rod, Sportsmans Warehouse, Phoenix Fishing Supply, NAPA Auto Parts in Salome, Wayside Inn, Anitas Cocina, and Sizzling Wok. Everyone also enjoyed a free steak dinner provided through donations from Crissman Construction, Drescher Roofing, and FOP Lodge 71.    Central Arizona  URBAN LAKES  All the participating Urban Fishing Program lakes and ponds in the Phoenix and Tucson areas will be stocked with 15-20 inch channel catfish on Thursday, March 22.   It is still possible to catch trout, especially at first and last light. Top baits continue to be Power Bait or other scented dough baits and worms. Trout are biting best on Power Bait fished off the bottom and worms fished under a bobber.  With warming temperatures, the action for largemouth bass should be picking up soon as they move back into the shoreline areas in search of food and spawning sites.  Regulations require that all bass be at least 13-inches in length before they can be kept. Please exercise good care and technique in safely handling and releasing bass.   TEMPE TOWN LAKE  Rainbow trout were stocked two weeks ago. Anglers are reporting some limits; fishing has been on the slow side.  Fish will bite on corn, Power Bait, salmon eggs and inline spinners. Bass fishing is picking up. Blades, crankbaits and spinnerbaits are working.  Minnows under a slip bobber will work as well.  A mixed bag of yellows, catfish and sunfish can also be caught this way.  Yellow bass and bluegill are plentiful in the 5- to 7-inch range and will bite mealworms or night crawlers. Channel catfish averaging 1 to 2 pounds will bite stink baits, hot dogs and shrimp. Carp fishing is excellent using corn and dough-bait. Remember no gas motors are allowed (trolling motors are) and you must have a boating permit, which can be obtained, at the Town Lake operations center.     LAKE PLEASANT - Water level is at 1,693 feet (90-percent full). Bass fishing is has turned on. This is one of the states fishing hot spots. Look for spawning bass in the backs of coves or bass staging for the spawn.  Adult fish are staging in the mouths of coves, secondary points on the inside of coves, along submerged creek channels, or along break-offs adjacent to large flats. The annual bald eagle closure is in effect on the Agua Fria.  Anglers are reporting fantastic catches of striped bass and white bass and crappie above the eagle closure, access from the Table Mesa road is the way to go.  Currently boats can be launched off the shore. Small car toppers with a small motor work well.  If you can, catch live shad and use for bait. Anchovies, minnows and -ounce jigs with a 2-inch pearl white curly tail grub will also work. I got a report that crappies averaging a pound and a half are biting in the back of Humbug Cove on minnows 20 feet down. For those interested no Quagga mussels were found in the lake during recent SCUBA surveys near and around the marina, marina tires and the towers.    ROOSEVELT LAKE - The lake is 61-percent full at elevation 2,117 feet. This could be the beginning of what snowmelt we will get. I read a report from SRP saying the lake will rise 9-11 feet by May with the current snow pack. Largemouth bass fishing is busting loose. High pressure and warm days will start to get those lethargic bass active. Drop shots and wired worms are the baits of choice. Crappie fishing (pre-spawn trolling) in the Tonto and Salt may be the best so far this week and weekend.  Try trolling in the Tonto or Salt arms of the lake.  Use John Deere grubs or BBC grubs on a 1/16oz. jighead in about 25 feet of water. Crappies could start spawning any time now. Many nice size bluegills are also being caught this way.  Catfishing is slow.  Fishing for smallmouth bass has been good lately, especially on windy days. Try areas where waves are stirring up the rocky shoreline. Use in-line spinners and crayfish imitations especially off rocky points and cliff walls and live night crawlers. Remember the slot is in place for smallmouth as well. Note: anglers are reminded of the slot bass size limit that remains in effect at Roosevelt. Bass between 13 to 16 inches must be released immediately. Also those bass below 13 inches and above 16 inches that are kept can only be gutted with the head and tail attached so the legal length can be determined. All other fish such as crappie, catfish and bluegill harvested from the lake must have a piece of skin attached to the fillets so species can be determined.  ADEQ discovered and captured three gizzard shad in the lake last month.  This is the first positive confirmation of this species in the lake.   APACHE - Lake is 91-percent full and rising.  The Apache Lake habitat project has been completed and is now under water.  Thanks to all the volunteers who came out to help, we could not have done it without your support. Fishing is good for yellow bass down by the dam.  Yellow bass are hitting jigs and spoons. Fish for them around balls of shad in 20-60 feet of water. Cut bait also works well for them.  Largemouth bass fishing is slow. Carp fishing is excellent with corn and dough bait. There is a certified scale at the marina boathouse.    CANYON - Lake is 95-percent full at 1,659 feet.  Anglers are reporting that bass action is extremely slow.  Rainbow trout were stocked three weeks ago.  Fish with salmon eggs, corn or Power Bait near the Acacia picnic area.  Break out the large imitation swim baits like Castaic and try for some monster largemouths.  Anglers are reporting a few monster bass at this time.  Fishing with the swim baits can be slow; however the fish you do get will be big!   SAGUARO - Lake level is 1,524 feet (95-percent full). No reports lately. We investigated a fish recently. Threadfin shad were found dead and dying from dam to dam.  This is the only fish species that was observed and is due to golden algae.  Preliminary counts of the algae assemblage are at 40 percent for GA.  Bass fishing has been very slow. Rainbow trout were stocked recently. Try the Butcher Jones area with corn or Power Bait. There is a certified scale at the marina to get an official weight and still release your catch. Two witnesses are needed for the weight to be official.    BARTLETT  Lake level is at 1,748 feet (40 -percent full) Bass and crappie fishing has turned on and this is a fishing hot spot.  Crawdad imitations and worming rigs (drop shots and Texas-rigs) are producing. Some anglers are picking up crappies in the 2-pound range using and near submerged fish city.  One angler even caught crappies from shore using a slip bobber and minnows, including a 2.5-pound beauty. Kalin 1/16-ounce black/blue/chartreuse jigs, but overall, crappie fishing is good on the east side coves. Catfishing is slow.  Remember the live bait most come from the lake itself (excluding minnows, water dogs or worms) not transported from another body of water!  Currently the Forest Service is repairing the main ramp and the ramps are out of the water, you must launch from shore.   HORSESHOE - Lake is empty. Road is closed   VERDE RIVER The stretch of river below the dam to the Needle rock area holds some nice bass and catfish. Rainbow trout are being stocked near Oak Creek and the Camp Verde Cottonwood area.  Use inline spinners and Power Bait. Remember that no baitfish can be transported into this part of the river (above Horseshoe). For further information concerning regulations, call the Arizona Game and Fish Department at (480) 324-3544. This morning flow was 290 cfs at Tangle Creek station above Horseshoe Lake.     LOWER SALT RIVER (below Saguaro Lake)  The Lower Salt River is flowing at 300 cfs Monday morning.  The Verde is flowing at 200 cfs coming in at Phon D Sutton.  Trout were stocked last week at Phon D Sutton and Granite Reef parks (#1575).  Power Bait, inline spinners and corn will work.  Fly fishermen may have luck using nymphs or wooly buggers.  Largemouth bass fishing can be good using crankbaits in back eddies and near brush.   Colorado River Northwest  LAKE POWELL  By Wayne Gustaveson. Lake Elevation: 3,597. Water temp: 47-51 F. Bass fishermen have already been competing for fishing honors in the early season at Lake Powell. Cold temperatures, and a little snow mixed with wind did not dampened their spirits as they showed their prowess by catching bass in the toughest of cold weather conditions. The Anglers Choice Team tournament saw many 5-fish bass limits with some teams weighing almost 15 pounds for a 3-pound average. Smallmouth up to 4-pounds and largemouth over 5-pounds were taken and released following the weigh-in.    There are as many productive techniques as there are fishermen. Some of the most productive in this early tournament involved a fishing strategy using multiple methods. Most know that a few bass will be easy prey and bite on the first cast. After that it takes more patience to continue to catch fish.    Bass were often shallow but not in the backs of the canyons. Bass like points with shallow feeding areas in close proximity to deep water. Wise anglers fished the points and brush shelters. Prowling fish were taken on deep diving crankbaits tossed to the far side of the point. The deep diver was then dragged through the soil and rocks leaving a mud trail. Bass attracted to the mud trail would then bite as the lure broke out into deeper water. Remember that each team only had to catch 5 fish to get a limit. Fishing was not fast, with one or two keepers caught in 2 hours of cranking. It takes hundreds of casts and great patience to be successful in cold conditions.   When prowling fish quit biting, it’s time to break out the plastic and fish slow and deep for resting fish. Time tested jig and pork rind and large hula grubs caught some fish but perhaps the best deep approach was the drop shot rig. The weight is placed on the bottom with the plastic worm, grub or Senko hooked on a super sharp hook some 6-10 inches up the line. When fished correctly, the weight rests on the bottom and the plastic bait resembles a free swimming or resting bait fish. A slight movement of the rod tip allows the bait to flutter and twitch with tantalizingly slow movements that are attractive in cold weather. The weight is pulled along the bottom on a tight line and then allowed to rest and flutter in one spot for longer periods.   Fish become accustomed to seeing the same popular baits fished time after time. Sometimes the new bait or new color draws the strike while the old standard is ignored. A new plastic bait from Yamamoto worked very well in this event. It is called a SHAD-SHAPED WORM and is designed specifically for drop shot fishing.   The deep-diving cranks needed a bit of innovation as well. The lures that dug up mud at 15-25 feet worked better when a “hot color” like red-crayfish or fire tiger was used. Fishing is off to a good early start. When temperatures warm up, it won’t take nearly as many casts or crazy colors to catch fish here.  Tournament anglers found some willing stripers in Rock Creek, Neanderthal Cove and Warm Creek. A few walleye were taken as well.  Remember to protect the big lake from hitch hiking mussels coming from Lakes Mead, Mohave or Havasu. Drain all water and wash the boat, then let it dry 5 days before launching in a new water.   LEES FERRY  Report courtesy Lees Ferry Anglers, Date: Wednesday, March 14, by Capt. Jim Veller   Upriver: 8.00  Walk-In: 3.50  1 = Go fish somewhere else  10 = Rent a helicopter and get here now!    Todays Crowd Rating:  Upriver: 5. Key:  Walk In: 3  1 = Sleep late and fish where you want.  10 = Very crowded, get up early!    Todays Weather: We had mostly sunny skies with highs around 82 degrees. We had howling winds last night, but it laid down this morning. Tomorrow the high temp. is forecast for 79 with mostly sunny skies.   Todays River Flows: Releases from Glen Canyon Dam in February, 2007 on Mondays and Fridays will vary between a low of 8,500 cfs to a high of 14,500 cfs. On Saturdays, release fluctuations will vary between a low of 8,500 cfs to a high of 14,000 cfs. On Sundays, release fluctuations will vary between a low of 8,500 cfs to a high of 13,000 cfs.    Todays Fly Fishing: Fishing has been quite good the last three days. Perhaps the great weather has made the fish as happy as we are. Morning riffle fishing with small glo bugs combined with a bead head midge has been turning the trick.  We still have spawning fish in the rivers but use caution around redds so no damage is done. Attractor dries with a midge dropper has been very effective also. Midge hatches have been increasing in density. Look for rising fish in the back eddies.    Todays Walk-in Fishing: No new reports received today. As of late it is hard to locate the fish in this section. Glo bugs, scuds, and San Juans are recommended.    Spin Fishing Report: This is the latest report received. Fishing with plenty of lead and bouncing you offering near the bottom of the river is effective, while using red San Juans, and large egg patterns.    LAKE MEAD - Important notice: With the recent discovery of invasive quagga mussels in Mead, Mohave and Havasu, proper cleaning of all watercraft is critical to help prevent the spread of these invaders.  Please drain and dry your livewell and bilge on land. Drain all the water you can from your engine. Also, inspect your vessel and trailer, removing any visible mussels, but also feel for any rough or gritty spots on the hull. These may be young mussels that can be hard to see.   For more information, go to the Arizona Game and Fish Department’s web pages at azgfd.gov or visit http://100thmeridian.org/.   Fishing has been slow during the day.  Some anglers report no stripers being caught after trolling all day. As the water warms look for the bass to really turn on. The ramp is still open at South Cove. The launching is shallow. The lake level continues to be fairly stable at or near 1,129, but look for it to be going down. Game and Fish biologists observed lots of shad and stripers during their survey of Gregg’s Basin last October. Large tilapia and catfish were also sampled.      LAKE MOHAVE - Important notice: With the recent discovery of invasive quagga mussels in Mead, Mohave and Havasu, proper cleaning of all watercraft is critical to help prevent the spread of these invaders.  Please drain and dry your livewell and bilge on land. Drain all the water you can from your engine. Also, inspect your vessel and trailer, removing any visible mussels, but also feel for any rough or gritty spots on the hull. These may be young mussels that can be hard to see.   For more information, go to the Arizona Game and Fish Department’s web pages at azgfd.gov or visit http://100thmeridian.org/.   No new reports. Fishing for largemouth has been slow. Water temp is around 53F.  Look for the bite to pick up in the next couple of weeks. The striper bite has been slow as well.  Anchovies are the most popular bait for stripers, but if you want to try something different, use shrimp or squid. Davis Dam has plenty of shoreline for numerous anglers to enjoy the fishing. Cabinsite and Telephone Cove also provide plenty of shoreline fishing access. If you have a boat, try fishing near cottonwood cove or Aztec wash for trout or large stripers. Also, there is a wheelchair accessible fishing pier just south of the main launch ramp at Katherine’s Landing.     WILLOW BEACH Important notice: With the recent discovery of invasive quagga mussels in Mead, Mohave and Havasu, proper cleaning of all watercraft is critical to help prevent the spread of these invaders. Please drain and dry your livewell and bilge on land. Drain all the water you can from your engine.

For more information, go to the Arizona Game and Fish Department’s web pages at azgfd.gov or visit http://100thmeridian.org/.   No new reports.  Access to Willow Beach by road is available. Trout are stocked every Friday. The fishing for trout has been slow, but the striper bite has picked up a little and some big fish are being caught.     TOPOCK MARSH - Important notice: With the recent discovery of invasive quagga mussels in Mead, Mohave and Havasu, proper cleaning of all watercraft is critical to help prevent the spread of these invaders.  Please drain and dry your livewell and bilge on land. Drain all the water you can from your engine. Also, inspect your vessel and trailer, removing any visible mussels, but also feel for any rough or gritty spots on the hull. These may be young mussels that can be hard to see.   For more information, go to the Arizona Game and Fish Department’s web pages at azgfd.gov or visit http://100thmeridian.org/.   The crappie bite is starting to pick up.  Anglers reporting catching 7-8 per day from boat.  Catfish and bass fishing is also beginning to pick up.  Anglers are having some success from shore.  Look for the fishing to really improve as the marsh water level continues to rise and the water warms.  Game and fish biologist sampled lots of large mouth bass the middle of January throughout the marsh.  While the water is cold, the bass seem to be moving around.  Crappie and catfish populations looked really good as well.  You can access the marsh by boat at North Dike, Catfish Paradise, and Five-Mile Landing. All three also provide plenty of area for shoreline fishing too. For more information on the marsh, contact the Havasu National Wildlife Refuge at (760) 326-3853 or go to http://www.fws.gov/southwest/refuges/arizona/havasu/index.html.   COLORADO RIVER BELOW DAVIS DAM - Important notice: With the recent discovery of invasive quagga mussels in Mead, Mohave and Havasu, proper cleaning of all watercraft is critical to help prevent the spread of these invaders.  Please drain and dry your livewell and bilge on land. Drain all the water you can from your engine. Also, inspect your vessel and trailer, removing any visible mussels, but also feel for any rough or gritty spots on the hull. These may be young mussels that can be hard to see.   For more information, go to the Arizona Game and Fish Department’s web pages at azgfd.gov or visit http://100thmeridian.org/.   Rainbow trout are stocked by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service monthly. The fish are stocked in two locations, Davis Camp and near The Riverside. Trout fishing at the stocking sites is great immediately following the stockings, then the fish move out and you need to find them.   Anglers recently reported catching trout on the Arizona side across from the Riverside.  Water levels on the river fluctuate, so be careful.  You can check the Bureau of Reclamation Web site for flow predictions http://www.usbr.gov/lc/riverops.html/ before you go.     Southwestern Arizona  HAVASU  Important notice:  With the recent discovery of invasive quagga mussels in Mead, Mohave and Havasu proper, cleaning of all watercraft is extremely important to prevent the spread of this invasive species.  For more information on cleaning of watercraft, go to the Arizona Game and Fish Department’s web pages at azgfd.gov or visit http://100thmeridian.org/.   Striper fishing is good in the morning hours using cut anchovies by still fishing or trolling through from Winsor Basin south to Whipple Bay with limits of 1- to 2-pound fish.  A few larger fish are being caught on large white or hologram Rat-L-Traps, pointers, and diving trophy minnow jerkbaits.     Pre-spawn largemouth bass are being caught in 2 to 10 feet of water using Texas rigged Gitzits, Senkos, and shallow cranks like the R2S Cranky M.   The following report is courtesy Sand Point Marina. Jim Farnam caught a 5-pound catfish using shad as bait on March 5 at Jackass Cove. Some guests have reported seeing the Largemouth nesting already in various sites on the Lake.  As our weather stays consistently warmer and the Lakes water temperature increases, the bass will be more prevalent and the stripers more elusive. With the beginning of the spawning season here on the Lake, fishing will undoubtedly take on a totally different feel from that of the winter months. Happy Fishing.   Outlook: On Havasu and Topock Gorge, largemouth bass, as well as smallmouth bass are expected to be good to excellent. The size will range from 13 inches and up with an occasional fish greater than 4 pounds. Striped bass will continue to be excellent for small fish (12-18 inches) with occasional fish over 8 pounds. Channel catfish as well as bluegill and redear sunfish will be fair to good. Flathead catfish fishing should be fair at the lower end of the lake (Bill Williams River Arm) through the fall. Sizes of flathead catfish can reach as high as 40 pounds. When fishing for them, select the interior points in the coves and the areas where artificial structure has been placed.    The cooler weather causes the bite to slow down so it is important to work your lures slower and in deeper water.  Put away your topwater lures and switch to plastics, crank baits, spinner baits, jigs, etc.      PARKER STRIP  Important notice:  With the recent discovery of invasive quagga mussels in Mead, Mohave and Havasu proper, cleaning of all watercraft is extremely important to prevent the spread of this invasive species.  For more information on cleaning of watercraft, go to the Arizona Game and Fish Department’s web pages at azgfd.gov or visit http://100thmeridian.org/.   Releases from Parker Dam are increasing. Look to do so for the next few weeks, which means there is plenty of water to get out and fish on.  Stripers are being caught off La Paz County Park.  Anglers say anchovies or liver work for bait.   Smallmouth and sunfish are biting on mealworms and night crawlers. The bigger fish are not moving much yet.     Channel cats should start picking up over the next few weeks.  Try anchovies or worms for bait.     Flatheads prefer to bite on live bait such as bluegill.     Trout are still available and biting in the lagoon at La Paz County Park and should be there for another week or two.   Outlook: smallmouth bass with fish over two pounds in size are expected to be good this fall.  In addition, redear sunfish should also be good in the pound plus sizes. Channel and flathead catfish are always fair in this section of the Colorado River. Below the dam, striper fishing should also be fair using anchovies this fall.    COLORADO RIVER OUTLOOK (from Palo Verde to Yuma)   Colorado River (between Palo Verde Diversion Dam and Walter’s Camp    This area should be fair for both smallmouth bass (in the channel) and largemouth bass (in the backwaters) throughout the entire area. Channel and flathead catfish are always fair to good in this section of the Colorado River. Most of the flathead catfish will be in the 2 to 5 pound size range with an occasional fish over 30 pounds. The time for fishing for both species of catfish is in the evening to midnight.      Colorado River (between Walter’s Camp and Picacho State Park    This section of the Colorado River is relatively remote and can only be accessed by boat from either end. Fishing is expected to be fair to good for flathead catfish with sizes over 40 pounds. The best time for fishing for both species of catfish will be in the evening to midnight. Largemouth bass and bluegill are also present in the various backwaters and slack water areas. Other species available in the main river are smallmouth bass, and striped bass.    Colorado River (between Picacho State Park and Imperial Dam    This area is expected to be fair to good for largemouth bass, channel catfish, and flathead catfish. Bass and channel catfish in excess of 5 pounds are present along with flathead catfish as large as 40 pounds. Bluegills are also present in the various backwaters and an occasional striped bass will be caught in the main river channel.    Colorado River (between Laguna and Morelos dams    This area will be fair for largemouth bass and flathead catfish. Bass in excess of 5 pounds are common and flathead catfish over 20 pounds are a good bet. In this area, accessibility to the river is dependent on the amount of water being released. Usually shallow draft boats work the best. The lower end has had some dredging work done and the larger boat will be able to get on the river in that area.   MARTINEZ LAKE/COLORADO RIVER   Important notice:  With the recent discovery of invasive quagga mussels in Mead, Mohave and Havasu proper, cleaning of all watercraft is extremely important to prevent the spread of this invasive species.  For more information on cleaning of watercraft, go to the Arizona Game and Fish Department’s web pages at azgfd.gov or visit http://100thmeridian.org/.   This area should be fair for both smallmouth bass (in the channel) and largemouth bass (in the backwaters) throughout the entire area. Channel and flathead catfish are always fair to good in this section of the Colorado River. Most of the flathead catfish will be in the 2- to 5-pound size range with an occasional fish over 30 pounds. The time for fishing for both species of catfish is in the evening to midnight.      MITTRY LAKE  Shore anglers have been catching carp, bluegill, and channel catfish by using corn, dough bait and worms for the catfish.   YUMA AREA RIVERS/CANALS  Good for channel catfish using stink bait and chicken livers.   FORTUNA POND  Bluegills are being caught on meal worms and nigh crawlers. Largemouth bass are being caught on worms, spinnerbaits, and plastics. Channel catfish are being caught on stink baits and chicken livers.   REDONDO POND  “Yuma Lakes.” Not much fishing pressure here lately, which could mean hungry fish!  Try a small boat or tube to catch bass or large bluegill on the north side of the pond which is BLM public land.   YUMA WEST WETLANDS POND  Good for small bluegill, carp, and bass. The bite was on all day long with channel catfish starting late in the afternoon using liver and stink baits.  A 7.5-pound channel catfish was caught.    ALAMO  This is a fishing hot spot for bass and crappie. Report courtesy Mark Knapp, Alamo Lake State Park.  Well folks, bass fishing is pretty good right now.   The bass are moving up into the shallows getting ready for the spawn. I’ve seen some nice bass caught this week.  Several six pounders and two eight pounders have been weighed, and tossed back in the lake.  Training wheels are the way to go right now.  Try throwing a spinnerbait right up to the shoreline and hold your pole.  Crappie fishing has picked back up again. Anglers are catching 10 to 30 a day. The crappies are in 19 to 15 feet of water. Roadrunner jigs with a minnow trailer are the hot ticket. Shore fishing is hit-and-miss. Try using a minnow and a bobber and work the ramp areas.  The lake level is 1,116 with releases of 40 cfs.  Both ramps work great…. Remember sun block and bug spray.   North Central Region  KAIBAB LAKE Campground closed Oct. 1.   CATARACT LAKE  Lake will be open for walk-in day use only.     CITY RESERVOIR  Closed.   DOGTOWN LAKE No Report.     JD DAM  Lake level has come up. Anglers are catching brown trout fly-fishing.    SANTA FE  Lake is full.   WHITEHORSE LAKE  No Report.  Campground closed Oct. 1.  Lake will be open for walk-in day use only.     FLAGSTAFF LAKES:   LOWER LAKE MARY The Lake is extremely low.  No fish; the lake suffered a winter kill due to low lake levels.   UPPER LAKE MARY  The Lake is mostly thawed with small patches of ice near the boat launch near the dam.     ASHURST LAKE  Lake is open; some nice rainbow trout are being caught.   FRANCIS SHORT POND  Open small 10-12 inch rainbows are being caught on flies.   KINNIKINICK LAKE  Lake is open.  No report       MARSHALL LAKE  No report.  The road into the lake is closed at this time. Walk in access only.    OAK CREEK  Fishing is slow. A few small rainbow trout are being caught on flies.    LONG LAKE  Lake is open.  No report     SOLDIERS & SOLDIERS ANNEX  Lake is open.  No report.    BEAVER CREEK  No report.     WEST CLEAR CREEK  No report.    STONEMAN LAKE  NO FISH.    MINGUS LAKE  Mingus Lake is scheduled to begin being stocked in April. The Forest Service locks the gate for vehicle traffic around Nov. 15. Walk-in traffic will still be permitted after that date. The water levels are down and the water is very turbid. Try bright-colored Power Bait, salmon eggs, or various spinners.  Trout stocking is scheduled to resume the first week in March.   DEAD HORSE STATE PARK  Trout were stocked Feb 26.  Following the stocking, fishing has been very good. Experienced anglers limit in 30-45 minutes. One angler was doing very well using a Power Worm with smelly jelly. Super Dupers, KastMaster, and flies fished on a bobber work well.  While Power Bait is an effective stand by, it may take you a little longer to limit.  This was the last scheduled trout stocking, but Game and Fish plans to stock catfish soon (the date has not been set). Watch the fishing report to find out when. Dead Horse State Park employees and Game and Fish biologists placed 40-plus Christmas trees in the lower lagoon as fish habitat on Jan. 16.  Fish should begin to congregate near these trees within days.   VERDE RIVER (throughout Verde Valley)  Trout were stocked at all five sites last week (March 2). The fishing was fair on Saturday. As the flows slow and the water clears a little, look for the bite to pick up. Stocking sites are at Tuzigoot Bridge outside of Clarkdale, the bridge that leads to the Deadhorse State Park, at Deadhorse State Parks access point called the Jacks, at the White Bridge in Camp Verde, and at Bignotti Beach. Try using spinners to get the active fish.  If that doesnt work you can always try power bait. Trout are scheduled to be stocked again the week of the 19.   LYNX LAKE  Trout were last stocked the week of March 5.  Fishing continues to be slow.  As the water warms hopefully the bite will pick up a little.   FAIN LAKE  Rainbow trout were stocked last week, the week of March 5. The fishing was good. One angler reported catching 14 fish in a few hours (all were released) the largest was 19 inches.   Fish were biting floating night crawlers and Mepps spinners.  Power bait and most spinners should do well also.   GOLDWATER LAKETrout stocking resumed the week of Feb 12.  Fishing success at Goldwater has dropped off markedly during the last week (Feb 28-Mar 4). Most anglers are reporting little to no activity. More strikes reported by fly fisherman, than by bait/lure.  It’s been windy/breezy, and overnight temps are in the 12-20F range. Daytime highs not much above 50F last week.  The next stocking is scheduled for this week (week of March 12).  Look for the fishing to pick up following the stocking. The water is pretty cold though, so give the fish some time to acclimate.  Try fishing at one location, if you dont have success in an hour or two, move to another. You may try starting at the fishing pier. If you dont have a fish in an hour or so try a new spot. The next trout stocking is scheduled for the week of March 12.  Large bluegills were stocked June 7. If you fish Goldwater and are having luck, please e-mail me at mchmiel@azgfd.gov so I can share your successes with others.

[ edit ]   Regions   The islands of Vanuatu are grouped into six geographic provinces, the names formed by combining the first syllables or letters of the major islands in each.  Roughly north to south:      Torba  (Torres islands, Banks islands)    Sanma  (Santo, Malo)    Penama  (Pentecost, Ambae, Maewo)    Malampa  (Malakula, Ambrym, Paama)    Shefa  (Shepherd group, Efate)    Tafea  (Tanna, Aniwa, Futuna, Erromango, Aneityum)         [ edit ]   Cities   Luganville   Port-Vila  - capital    [ edit ]   Other destinations   [ edit ]   Understand   [ edit ]   History   The British and French who settled the New Hebrides in the 19th century agreed in 1906 to an Anglo-French Condominium, which administered the islands until independence in 1980. European settlers released several  saltwater crocodiles  on the island, although today's population on the island officially stands at 2 or 3 medium-sized individuals on the Banks Islands and no breeding has been observed. Despite its proximity to Papua New Guinea, crocodiles do not naturally occur on Vanuatu.    [ edit ]   People   [ edit ]   Climate   The climate is tropical, and almost always warm, with temperatures in the 20s and 30s celsius.  The wet season runs from November to April, and can be very rainy and humid.  Cyclones may occur from December to April.    [ edit ]   Holidays   [ edit ]   Currency and finance   The local currency is the Vatu (VT), which is worth approximately 1 US cent or 0,7 Euro cents at the time of writing.  There are notes for 200 VT, 500 VT, 1000 VT, and 5000 VT, while coins include 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 VT pieces.  Credit and debit cards on the major networks (Cirrus, Maestro, etc) are accepted by many businesses in town.  ATMs are available in Port Vila, and include the Australian banks ANZ and Westpac.  The National Bank of Vanuatu has a branch at the airport and is open for all flight arrivals.  Otherwise, banking hours are from 8:30am to 3pm.  Tipping is not expected in Vanuatu, nor is haggling or bargaining.  It is strongly recommended not to change money or Traveller's Cheques at the airport, but to wait until you are in Port Vila to change them due to the poor rates and commission charges at the airport.    [ edit ]    Communications    Telephone service is widely available, including mobile phone service around town.  Local SIM cards can be purchased on arrival for around 3000VT.  Fax service may be available from your hotel.  Internet access is available from some Internet cafes and from wireless hotspots in the downtown of Port Vila.  Hotspots include the caf Au Pch Mignon on the main street of town, and another cafe down by the harbourside.  You can send letters and postcards from mailboxes in the streets, however the incoming postal service can be patchy, especially for parcels, so don't rely on people sending you things while you're staying in Vanuatu.    [ edit ]   Get in   [ edit ]   By boat   Vanuatu's main ports are  Port-Vila  on the island of Efate and  Luganville  on the island of  Espiritu Santo .    The Pacific and Orient (P&O) Cruise lines operate regular cruises through Vanuatu waters.    Tallship  Soren Larsen , +64 9 817 8799, [ [2]  sails from Fiji to Port Vila and Santo and explores the northern Banks Islands once a year. 2008: Sails from Lautoka to Yasawa island then Vanuatu - 18 nights from 31 Aug-18 Sept.    Subsequent 11 night cruises explore the Banks Islands, then the isolated islands of central Vanuatu, depart from Port Vila via Tanna island to New Caledonia on 19 Oct.    [ edit ]   By plane   The main international airport is located in  Port-Vila  with flights to and from:     Australia  Brisbane  -  Air Vanuatu  [3]  (Qantas code share  [4] ) and Pacific Blue  [5]   Sydney  -  Air Vanuatu  ( Qantas  code share)  Melbourne  -  Air Vanuatu      New Zealand  Auckland  -  Air Vanuatu  and  Air New Zealand      Fiji  Nadi  -  Air Vanuatu  and  Air Pacific      New Caledonia  Nouma  -  Air Vanuatu  and  Aircalin       Singapore - Singapore Airlines  Solomon Islands - Solomon Airlines    Direct flights from both  Sydney  and  Brisbane  to  Luganville  with  Air Vanuatu  [6] .    [ edit ]   Get around   [ edit ]   Airplane   Within Vanuatu, several air carriers are operating to bring visitors around to several of the islands the country has. These include Vanair (not to be confused with Air Vanuatu), Helikopta Compani, Sea Air and Air Club Vila <ref>Lonely Planet:Vanuatu</ref>     [ edit ]   Boat   Within Vanuatu, several companies provide boating service between the islands. These include Ifira Shipping Agencies and Toara Coastal Shipping.<ref>Lonely Planet:Vanuatu</ref>    [ edit ]   Bus   In Port Vila the buses are vans seating about 10 people, which largely traverse the main road and go and stop where you would like them to go.  Wave at them to stop one heading in the direction you want to go.  They are plentiful within the city and outside the city you can usually arrange for a bus to meet you at a particular time.  If one looks full, just wait for the next one.  The buses are used by locals, but are very friendly, cheap, and easy to use by tourists.  Fare is usually calculated per person.  The cost is usually 100 vatu per person anywhere around Port Vila.  If you are travelling a longer distance, the fare may rise to 200 - 300 vatu per person.    [ edit ]   Taxi   Taxis are plentiful within Port Vila.  Fare is calculated per taxi.    [ edit ]   Talk   There are three official languages: English, French and Bislama. Bislama is a pidgin language  and now a creole in urban areas  which essentially combines a typically Melanesian grammar with a mostly English vocabulary. It is the only language that can be understood and spoken by the whole population of Vanuatu, generally as a second language.  In addition, 113 indigenous languages are still actively spoken in Vanuatu. The density of languages per capita is the highest of any nation in the world, with an average of only 2000 speakers per language. All of these vernacular languages belong to the Oceanic branch of the Austronesian family.    [ edit ][ add listing ]   Buy   There are two market areas along the foreshore in Port Vila.  The main market sells mostly food, and you can find all kinds of local produce there.  Further north, near the beach, there is a row of grass-roofed market stalls that sell clothing, bags, sarongs, and other items.  The woven grass bags and mats are widely available and very attractive.    [ edit ][ add listing ]   Eat   There are many restaurants and eateries in Port Vila, ranging from up-market places catering to tourists and expats, to more low-key establishments.  The approximate cost of lunch would be around the 1000-1500 vatu range, depending on where and what you eat.  Some examples of prices:     sandwiches, around 450-600 VT   bacon and eggs, 750 VT   burger with fries or salad, around 1000 VT   main meal, eg steak or seafood, 1200-2000 VT   large, fresh-squeezed juice, around 500VT    [ edit ]   Lap-Lap   The traditional dish which you will most likely be offered once during your stay is a root vegetable cake called lap lap. Essentially this either manioc (kasava), sweet potato, taro or yam shaved into the middle of a banana leaf with island cabbage and sometimes a chicken wing on top. This is all wrapped up into a flat package and then cooked in hot stones underground till it all melts together into a cake. The best place to pick up some of this is at the food market in the town centre and should cost you about 100 vatu ($1.20AUD).     [ edit ]   Tuluk   This is a variation of lap lap with the the cake rolled into a cylinder with meat in the middle. It tastes a lot like a sausage roll. You can find these again in the market (usually from mele village people) but they will be served from foam boxes to keep them warm.    [ edit ]   Steak   Vanuatu's meat is renowned in the region.  At the airports you will see signs reminding you to pack the 25kg of meat permitted to other nearby island nations.  The reason the meat's so good is that it's all naturally grown, with no feedlots or other problems of westernised mass production.  The result of this is that the steaks are very good indeed.    [ edit ][ add listing ]   Drink   [ edit ]    Kava    Kava is a local drink, made from the roots of the plant  Piper methysticum , a type of pepper. Kava is intoxicating, but not like alcohol. Its effects are sedative. Some travellers have experienced a hangover from its consumption.  Kava is consumed in private homes and in local venues called Nakamal. Some of the resorts also offer kava on occasion for travellers to try.  Kava is served in a ""shell"" or small bowl. Drink the whole shell-ful down steadily, then spit. It's handy to have a soft drink on hand to rinse with afterwards, as the taste of kava is strong and not very pleasant.    [ edit ]    Alcohol    Alcoholic beverages are also widely available.  Resorts, bars, and restaurants serving tourists have a wide range of drinks available.  The local beers are called ""Tusker"" and ""Vanuatu Bitter"".    [ edit ][ add listing ]   Sleep   There is a choice of all levels of accommodation.    [ edit ]   Resort     Le Lagon  is the most popular and largest of the resorts. It has been operating for over 30 years. It offers substantial discounts for children, as as a result there are lots of kids here during the Australian school holidays.    Iririki Island  is an exclusive resort situated in Port Vila's harbour. It used to be ""adults only"" but since 2006 it has areas that allow children. A ferry runs back and forth to the main downtown area.    Erakor Island Resort  is situated on an island in the lagoon, close to Le Lagon. A free ferry takes you to and from the island.    [ edit ]   Mid-Range   [ edit ]   Budget   When visiting other islands or villages outside of the cities, there are many small guest houses that charge around 2000 VT per night and offer full service (meals, laundry, etc).  Many of the motels in Port Vila and Luganville also fall into the budget category, with prices around 2000 VT per night.  There are a number of websites which list such motels.  Note that budget accommodation in Vanuatu will probably mean shared bathroom facilities, and cold water only.    [ edit ]   Learn   [ edit ]   Work   [ edit ]    Volunteering    There are many charitable organisations and NGOs operating in Vanuatu, and a strong community of volunteers in the area.  If you are interested in volunteering in Vanuatu, the following organisations place volunteers there:      Peace Corps     VSO     Oxfam Australia     [ edit ]    Other work    Many people from overseas work in Vanuatu, either running their own businesses or employed by others.  Generally speaking, work permits are only available for positions where there are not enough ni-Vanuatu to meet demand.    [ edit ]   Stay safe   Port Vila is, on the whole, a very safe and friendly environment.  You are unlikely to encounter any trouble unless you do something extremely provocative.  There are no seriously poisonous snakes, spiders, or insects on Vanuatu, however there are various poisonous aquatic animals that you should beware of if you are swimming, snorkeling, or diving in the area.  The most dangerous of these is the stonefish. Saltwater crocodiles are present, so the likelihood of an attack is minimal.    [ edit ]   Stay healthy   It is advisable to be immunised against Hepatitis A and B and typhoid fever before visiting Vanuatu.  Malaria is endemic within some areas of Vanuatu, but not  Port-Vila . If you are venturing outside the resort areas, check with your doctor before you travel.  Tap water in Port Vila is clean and potable, but is best avoided elsewhere.

Be aware of this, and respect locals' requests with regard to ""kastom"".  When visiting villages, women should dress modestly, wearing clothes that cover the shoulders and knees.

The tropical, pear-shaped island of Barbados is approximately 167 square miles, has a flawless climate and about 100 white and pink sandy   beaches!   It is believed that Barbados (""The Bearded Ones"" or Isla de los Barbados) was named by the Portuguese or the Spanish, depending on whom you ask, sometime before 1605.  Other occupants included the Caribs, Arawaks and the British.  The British arrived in the mid 1600s and ruled until Barbados became an independent nation November 30, 1966.  ""The Bearded Ones"" could have been a reference to long hanging roots of the indigenous bearded fig-tree, however no-one knows for certain.  There are eleven administrative  Parishes  in Barbados.  Bridgetown, in the Parish of St. Michael, is the capital and largest city.    Barbados, nicknamed ""Little England"" has retained many British traditions, including the sport (or game) of  cricket , playing of tennis on grass, judges wearing wigs, horse guards and bands.    Black slaves were brought to Barbados during the rule of the British and slavery continued until 1840.  Scots and Irish were also brought to the island where they worked as servants.  Undeveloped areas of the island are made up of swamps, rainforests and marshes.  Barbados, a part of the Lesser Antilles, is approximately 270 miles north east of Venezuela in South America.  It 'sits alone' just east of the Windward Island of St. Vincent in the Atlantic Ocean.  As well as St. Vincent, the closest island neighbours include St. Lucia, Grenada, and Trinidad and Tobago.  To work on your tan (not a good thing anymore!), head for the West Coast or Caribbean side, to places called Paradise, Folkstone and Holetown.  Swimming and surfing is on the South Coast.  Surfing is on the East Coast or Atlantic side of the island.  Barbados offers everything you could ever want on your vacation, so start planning your trip. You could soon be lying on a soft, sandy beach.

We in Arizona are fortunate               enough to have some of the most breathtaking, expansive lakes and               rivers in the country for our recreational enjoyment.               The               past few years have seen a steady increase in both the numbers               and diverse types of watercraft on our state's waterways, making               the responsibilities of boating enforcement and education increasingly               important and complex.               We at the Arizona Game and Fish Department are committed to               providing you with an enjoyable boating experience. We've produced               this guide to provide all boaters and water enthusiasts with a               positive experience while using one of Arizona's most valuable               resources, our waterways. In addition to courtesy and defensive               boating, this information is designed to aid you by highlighting               Arizona's boating laws on our state's waterways. We also encourage you to take a  complete course on boating safety , available from our certified instructors throughout the state.

Remember, ""it               only takes one""—one time not wearing a PFD (life               jacket), one drink could put you over the limit, or one second               of reckless operation.

The island is portrayed as the  little England  of the Caribbean because of its long association as a  British  colony.    [ edit ]   Districts   The island of Barbados has eleven parishes and can be divided into roughly five parts:      Bridgetown , including the capital city of Barbados and surrounding areas in St. Michael Parish.      Central Barbados , including the parishes of St. George, St. Thomas and parts of St. Joseph, St. John, St. Lucy and St. Andrew. Harrison Cave, the site of a massive limestone cavern, is one of the major attractions of Central Barbados, as well as Barbados Wildlife Reserve and Flower Forest to name a few. Luxury activities like golf and polo are also to be found.      Eastern Barbados , (the  East Coast ) the rugged Atlantic side of the island. Crane Beach in St. Philip Parish (South-East), Bathsheba in St. Joseph Parish and Bath in St. John are some of the more popular East Coast beaches. Also includes the less traveled parishes of St. John and St. Andrew.  Bathsheba  is a popular area, with the island's best-known surfing spot (The Soup Bowl) and tide pools - ideal for soaking.  Cattlewash  is a long stretch of beach with very rough waters. Other fishing villages include: Martin's Bay and Consett Bay in St. John.      Western Barbados , (the  West Coast ) the calm, Caribbean Sea side of the island covering the parishes of St. James, St. Peter and St. Lucy. Holetown and Speightstown are the two main towns.      Southern Barbados , (the  South Coast ) the parishes of Christ Church and parts of St. Michael and St. Philip. Includes St. Lawrence Gap, a lively area full of bars and restaurants;  Oistins , famous for its Friday fish fry on the beach; and Grantley Adams International Airport. Most of the budget hotels, guesthouses, and apartment are located here. Graeme Hall Nature Sanctuary is located here as well.       Butterfly Beach on the Southern Coast   [ edit ]   Cities      Map of Barbados   Barbados has the following towns and cities:      Bridgetown  - 'Capital'    Fustic     Holetown     Oistins     Speightstown     [ edit ]   Understand   Barbados has experienced several waves of human habitation.  The first wave were of the  Saladoid-Barrancoid  group, farmers, fishermen, and ceramists who arrived by canoe from Venezuela's Orinoco Valley around 350 AD. The  Arawak  people were the second wave, arriving from South America around 800 AD. Arawak settlements on the island include Stroud Point, Chandler Bay, Saint Luke's Gully, and Mapp's Cave. According to accounts by descendants of the aboriginal Arawak tribes on other local islands, the original name for Barbados was Ichirouganaim. In the 13th century, the  Caribs  arrived from South America in the third wave, displacing both the Arawak and the Salodoid-Barrancoid. For the next few centuries, they lived in isolation on the island.  The name ""Barbados"" comes from a Portuguese explorer named Pedro Campos in 1536, who originally called the island Los Barbados (""The Bearded Ones""), after the appearance of the island's fig trees, whose long hanging aerial roots resembled beards.  Between Campos' sighting in 1536 and 1550, Spanish conquistadors seized many Caribs on Barbados and used them as slave labor on plantations. The others fled the island, moving elsewhere.  Barbados was formally settled by the  British  in 1627. After several failed crops of cotton, sugarcane was introduced, and the colony established itself as a profitable plantation economy. Enslaved  Africans  were the primary source of labour on these plantations until 1834, when they won their freedom through several years of rebellion, supported by increasing pressure from anti-slavery movements in Britain.   The economy remained heavily dependent on sugar, rum, and molasses production through most of the 20th century. Though the shackles were removed, much of the repressive labour conditions of slavery remained on the island, until the 1930s, when the educated black middle class fought for universal adult suffrage and took the control of the country's local governance away from the British-descended local aristocracy. The country began a process of social and political reforms in the 1940s and 1950s which led to complete independence from the UK in 1966. In the 1980s, tourism and manufacturing surpassed the sugar industry in economic importance. Barbados has developed into a stable democracy with one of the highest rates of literacy in the Western Hemisphere.  Locals refer to themselves as  Bajans  and things Barbadian as  Bajan .    [ edit ]   Get in   [ edit ]   By plane   Sir Grantley Adams International Airport  ( IATA :  BGI ),( ICAO :  TBPB ) For its size, Barbados boasts a large international airport with dozens of flights arriving in the high season from the  UK  and  Canada  as well as the  United States . BMI, Virgin Atlantic and British Airways have many flights to Barbados while American is the dominant carrier from the United States ( Miami  and  New York ). Air Canada and Westjet fly from Canada. The airport is 13km (8 miles) east of Bridgetown. Buses run from a stop across the road from the airport up the coast to  Bridgetown ,  Holetown , and  Speightstown , but a taxi is the most convenient way to get to your hotel on arrival.    [ edit ]   By boat   Many  cruise ships  dock in Bridgetown, and in fact the Bridgetown deep water harbour has just been expanded to accommodate even more vessels. Private moorings are available around the island. Note: stiff penalties prohibit the dropping of anchors on coral reefs.    [ edit ]   Get around   Driving is on the left. The bus system is extensive, cheap, and fast - if you're headed to somewhere on the main route - but a car (or mini-moke) is the only way to see many of the out-of-the-way sights. Many of the drivers will hold a bus for you if they see you're from out of town reflecting the typical welcoming spirit. Buses are run by the Barbados Transport Board (blue color) and are quiet.  Private operators include the yellow buses, which play very loud music, and private mini-vans (white color), which are usually cramped and crowded. The two privately run means of transport are often driven very fast and recklessly. All charge the same fare (BD$1.50). Yellow buses and minivans offer change and even accept US dollars. BTB buses only accept local currency and do not give change.  There are also more than enough taxis to take you wherever you need to go on the island for reasonable prices. They do not use meters and it is best to negotiate the price before you get in. However, most taxi drivers are honest and you are unlikely to be overcharged.  Be sure to ask the management of the hotel or friendly locals what the going rate is for a cab ride to your destination.  Renting a car is a little on the expensive side.  If you are driving, be aware that the roads on the island are generally quite narrow, with the exception of the ABC highway.  The highway also has several long sections towards the west coast that is under large scale construction to expand the road to accommodate additional lanes.  It is advisable to be extra cautious as many roads on the island have sharp turns, steep inclines, and are generally quite bumpy, although most are paved.  Many of these proclaimed highways do not have sidewalks, so there can be pedestrians on the street sharing the road.  Many bus stops are also on the side of roads where there are no sidewalks.  Additionally, beware of impromptu passing lanes as slow drivers are often passed by others behind them when on two lane roads.  At most all of the local car rental agencies, a full Collision Damage Waiver policy is automatically included with the rental, except for any damage incurred to the car tires, a testament to the poor condition of the smaller roads and tendency of foreign drivers to miscalculate driving lanes and hit curbs.  Mopeds and bikes can also be rented to explore sites that aren't easily reached by cars.  This isn't highly recommended however due to the poor condition of many of the secondary and residential roads.  Except for the main highway, all the other roads provide a hazardous journey to the moped or bike rider due to no sidewalks, frequent pot holes, sharp corners and speeding local buses.  Another fun way to get around is to rent a moke available from any number of local car rental agencies.    [ edit ]   Talk   The official language in Barbados is English. Bajan (occasionally called Barbadian Creole or Barbadian Dialect), is an English-based creole language spoken by locals. Bajan uses a mixture of West African idioms and expressions along with British English to produce a unique Barbadian/West Indian vocabulary and speech pattern. There are a few African words interspersed with the dialect. Communication will not be a problem for any English speaker as Barbados has one of the highest literacy rates in the Western Hemisphere of around 99.9 percent.    [ edit ][ add listing ]   Buy   The local currency is the Bajan dollar, but US dollars are accepted just about everywhere in shops and restaurants. The exchange rate is fixed at 1.98 Bajan dollars to the US Dollar but almost everyone uses US$1 = BD$2. Keep in mind that exchangers in hotels may insist on taking an additional percentage of the exchange (typically 5%).  Many duty free shops cater to visitors, e.g., from cruise ships.  Bridgetown's main street hosts numerous duty-free jewelers.  At least one department store in Bridgetown (Cave Shepherd) offers a wide range of mercantile.  The small mall at the harbor also offers decent prices and selection, though goods produced in Barbados may be more expensive there than elsewhere on the island.  Barbados has a well-deserved reputation for producing excellent rum, e.g., Mount Gay.  Rum distilleries are usually open for tours, and typically offer samples and product for sale at prices often equal to the best found anywhere else.  (See also ""Drink"" below)   Barbados has a great variety of street vendors.  Haggle  aggressively. Don't stop until you're at about a third of the original price.

Flying fish can break through the surface of the water and fly distances of up to 100 yards at about 30 miles per hour, but they do not actually fly the same way as birds, because birds vibrate their wings during flight. Instead, the flying fish gets its power and speed from its tail fin, which it moves from side to side with powerful strokes.      Flying fish  -- the icon of the islands is found on coins, bills, and menus.  Flying fish is usually served lightly breaded and fried, with a yellow sauce.  Be warned: this yellow sauce consists of VERY hot Scotch Bonnet peppers with onions in a mustard sauce.    Pepperpot  -- a dish of long tradition and great pride among the Bajans, it is a pork stew in a spicy dark brown sauce.  Don't miss this.   Try ""cutters,"" a local sandwich. Varieties include flying fish cutters, ham cutters and the popular ""bread and two.""   Visitors seeking fast food will probably be disappointed; the titanic burger chains of the US failed miserably upon introduction to Barbados (Bajans eat nearly no beef).  However, chicken and fish sandwiches are wildly popular, so KFC and Chefette are ubiquitous.   Bajan cuisine is a strange mix of spicy, flavorful treats along with bland traditional English fayre.  So be prepared for meals where fiery stews sit side-by-side with beans on toast.   Every Friday night the place to be is the town of  Oistins  (on the south coast) for the ""fish fry"". This is a market where you can buy fresh fish cooked according to local recipes. Locals stay there late and dance until the early hours of the morning. This is now the second most popular tourist attraction on the island, after Harrison's Cave.   There are many fine restaurants on the island with the top two being The Cliff (on the west coast) and The Restaurant at South Sea (on the south coast).  Both are quite expensive, but serve beautiful food and a wonderful dining experience, overlooking the sea.  Still, you can find many hidden gems if you look hard enough.  Waterfront Cafe [2]  on the Careenage is an excellent place to sample Bajan Cuisine while sipping the local Banks Beer or a spicy Rum Punch.   Fish cakes, BBQ pig tails, fresh coconut, and roasted peanuts are offered by the many street vendors.  Weekend shut down!  Everything shuts down on the weekend so plan ahead especially if you are self-catering. Most stores are open till noon on Saturday and then nothing opens till Monday morning. On holiday weekends (Good Friday, national holidays, etc.) that fall on or close to a weekend stores may be closed for three or four days at a stretch. Convenience stores attached to gas stations may stay open but don't assume they will be.    [ edit ][ add listing ]   Drink   Barbados has some of the purest water in the world that can be drunk straight from the tap. Cruise ship employees are often seen stocking up on their water supplies while docked at the island.  Rum and rum drinks  are featured at every bar. Perhaps the most famous domestic brand offered is  Mount Gay Rum , which is very delicious.  Modest cost tours of the Mount Gay Rum distillery are available, and they offer samples of all their rums...also sold at attractive prices.   Small establishments called  rum shops  can be found all over Barbados.  They are where local citizens (95% men) meet to catch up on the local news.  Drop in and you can easily have a conversation with a real Barbadian.     Rum Shop in Barbados   Beer and wine is easy to find as well. Banks beer is Barbados' own beer and very good.  Tours of the  Banks brewery  are also available. While the tour itself is very hot and only moderately interesting an unlimited amount of beer is provided to those waiting for the tour to begin. Try to show up a few hours early and take advantage of a very good deal.

It is wise for tourists to avoid certain high risk activities. Such activities include walking on secluded beaches, day or night, and walking in unfamiliar residential neighborhoods or secluded areas away from main roads. Tourists, particularly women, should always stay in groups.  The most common kinds of crimes against tourists include taxi fraud, robbery, and shortchanging; however, rape and assaults are becoming more common. Most Bajans are by nature friendly, especially in the earlier part of the tourist season (November and December).  A special area of concern for visitors to Barbados is drugs.  The country's strict anti-drug policy is made apparent to visitors coming through Customs.  In practice, however, Europeans and Americans in Barbados can be offered marijuana or even cocaine frequently.  Sellers will often roam the beaches selling aloe vera or other such innocuous goods as a pretense to begin a conversation about ""ganja,"" ""smoke"" or ""bad habits.""  As a result, many hotels and resorts now ban the use of aloe vera under the pretense that it ""stains the towels.""  Regardless of one's inclination to using these drugs, it is not advisable to accept these offers. Marijuana is considered bad and is not accepted by Bajan police.  While Bajan police are not frequently encountered, they prosecute drug crimes with great prejudice.  Homosexuality is  illegal  in Barbados.     [ edit ]   Stay healthy   Beware of the sun, Barbados is only 13 degrees off of the equator and you can get sun burnt very easily.  It is very important to keep your water intake high.  Drink plenty of water or bring an umbrella to shade yourself against the sun, which is commonly done in the country.  During nightfall, it is advisable to put on bug spray, as mosquitoes are often a nuisance to anyone staying outdoors for prolonged periods.  This is most prevalent while eating at outdoor restaurants.    [ edit ]   Respect   Despite, or maybe because of the tropical climate, Bajans tend to dress conservatively when not on the beach. A bikini probably won't be appreciated in town and certainly not in church.  Barbadians are particularly sensitive to manners and saying good morning to people even strangers goes a long way to earning their respect.  When meeting a Barbadian, try not to discuss politics, and racial issuses. Talk is also important because Barbadians when speaking in Creole or (Bajan) as it is called, tend to speak fairly fast with their words.   The use of the ""N"" word is an extreme NO, but when talking to friends, words such a ""B"" which is short for ""Bro"", and ""Dawg"" are used to describe or refer to a friend, initially these words should not be used unless you know the person well.  Barbadians are mostly fun loving, and love to go out and have fun, this is noted by the large number of young people found in the clubs and on the Southern Coast of the island. Try not to stare at persons without good cause. If you happen to bounce into someone in a club, you should immediately apologise to the person.  Keep in mind that Barbadians are very protective of family and insults to a persons family are taken with high seriousness, this also relates into their views on issues such as homosexuality; most Barbadians do not agree with the practice and it is openly shunned.

At roughly 13 North and 59 West, the country lies in the southern  Caribbean  region, where it is a part of the  Lesser Antilles  island-chain. Its closest island neighbours are  St. Vincent  and  St. Lucia  to the west,and to south it borders, Trinidad and Tobago , with which Barbados now shares a fixed official maritime boundary, and the  South American  mainland 270 miles south of the island.   Barbados's total land area is about 430 square kilometres, (166 square miles), and is primarily low-lying, with some higher regions in the island's interior. The organic composition of Barbados is thought to be of non-volcanic origin and is predominantly composed of  limestone - coral  formed by subduction of the South American plate colliding with the Caribbean plate. The island's climate is  tropical , with constant  trade winds  off the Atlantic Ocean serving to keep temperatures mild. Some more undeveloped areas of the country contain tropical woodland and scrubland. Other parts of the interior which contribute to the agriculture industry are dotted with large  sugarcane  estates and wide, gently sloping  pastures , with many good views down to the sea coast.   Barbados has one of the highest  standards of living  and  literacy rates  worldwide. Despite its small size, Barbados's  Human Development Index  ranking is consistently among the top 50 in the world. For example, in 2006, it was ranked thirty-first in the world, and third in the  Americas , behind Canada and the United States.

The  Arawak  people were the second wave of migrants, arriving from South America around 800 CE. Arawak settlements on the island include  Stroud Point ,  Chandler Bay ,  Saint Luke's Gully  and  Mapp's Cave . According to accounts by descendants of the aboriginal Arawak tribes on other local islands, the original name for Barbados was  Ichirouganaim . In the thirteenth century, the Caribs arrived from South America in the third wave, displacing both the Arawak and the  Salodoid-Barrancoid . For the next few centuries, the Caribs  like the Arawak and the  Salodoid-Barrancoid   lived in isolation on the island.   The origin of the name Barbados is controversial. It was the Portuguese that were the first to conquer (discover) and name the island. As early as 1511, the island is referred to as  Ilha dos Barbados  (island of the bearded ones) in an official Portuguese document. It is a matter of conjecture whether the word ""bearded"" refers to the long, hanging roots of the bearded fig-tree ( Ficus citrifolia ), indigenous to the island, to bearded Amerindians occupying the island, or to the foam spraying over the outlying reefs giving the impression of a beard. In 1519, a map produced by the Genoese mapmaker Vesconte de Maggiola showed and named Barbados in its correct position north of  Tobago .   Portuguese   conquistadors  seized many  Caribs  on Barbados and used them as  slave labour  on  plantations . Other Caribs fled the island. [ citation needed ] , the Portuguese only briefly occupied Barbados from the mid 1500s to the 1620s en-route to  Brazil . Apart from displacing the Caribs, the Portuguese left little impact and by the 1610s, most settlers abandoned leaving the island for nearby South America.   British sailors who landed on Barbados in 1625 at the site of present-day  Holetown  on the Caribbean coast found the island uninhabited apart from the feral pigs which were left behind from the Portuguese. From the arrival of the first British settlers in 16271628 until independence in 1966, Barbados was under uninterrupted British control. Nevertheless, Barbados always enjoyed a large measure of local autonomy. Its  House of Assembly  began meeting in 1639. Among the initial important British figures was Sir  William Courten .   Starting in the 1620s, an increasing number of black slaves were brought to the isle. 5000 locals died of fever in 1647, and hundreds of slaves were executed by  Royalist  planters during the  English Civil War  in the 1640s, because they feared that the ideas of the  Levellers  might spread to the slave population if  Parliament  took control of Barbados.           The Barbadoes Mulatto Girl , after Agostino Brunias, 1779.       Large numbers of  Celtic  people, mainly from  Ireland  and  Scotland , went to Barbados as  indentured servants . Over the next several centuries the Celtic population was used as a buffer between the  Anglo-Saxon  plantation owners and the larger  African  population, variously serving as members of the Colonial militia and playing a strong role as allies of the larger African slave population in a long string of colonial rebellions. As well, in 1659, the English shipped many Irishmen and Scots off to Barbados as slaves, and  King James II  and others of his dynasty also sent Scots and English off to the isle: for example, after the crushing of the  Monmouth Rebellion  in 1685. The modern descendants of this original slave population are sometimes derisively referred to as  Red Legs , or locally 'ecky becky', and are some of the poorest inhabitants of modern Barbados. There has also been large-scale intermarriage between the African and Celtic populations on the islands and many Bajans are of European  Creole  descent. There are also rather a lot of Jewish people on this Island, the wealthy that could afford to get away from the Holocaust and their siblings. This is the reason some people mistake 'white Bajans' with the Celtic (aforementioned) and Jewish communities.   With the increased implementation of slave codes, which created differential treatment between Africans and the white settlers, the island became increasingly unattractive to poor whites. Black or slave codes were implemented in 1661, 1676, 1682, and 1688. In response to these codes, several slave rebellions were attempted or planned during this time, but none succeeded. However, an increasingly repressive legal system caused the gap between the treatment of typically white indentured servants and black slaves to widen. Imported slaves became much more attractive for the rich planters who would increasingly dominate the island not only economically but also politically. Some have speculated that, because the Africans could withstand tropical diseases and the climate much better than the white slave population, the white population decreased. This is inconsistent with the fact that many poor whites simply migrated to neighbouring islands and remained in tropical climates. Nevertheless, as those poor whites who had or acquired the means to emigrate often did so, and with the increased importation of African slaves, Barbados turned from mainly Celtic in the seventeenth century to overwhelmingly black by the nineteenth century.   Barbados eventually had one of the world's biggest sugar industries after migrant Brazilian Jews introduced the sugarcane to the island in the 1800s this quickly replaced  Tobacco  plantations on the islands which were previously the main export.As the  sugar  industry developed into its main commercial enterprise, Barbados was divided into large plantation estates that replaced the smallholdings of the early British settlers. Some of the displaced farmers moved to British colonies in North America, most notably  South Carolina ,  Panama  and  British Guiana . To work the plantations, West Africans were transported and enslaved on Barbados and other Caribbean islands. The British abolished the  slave trade  in 1807. In 1816, the continuation of slavery caused the largest major slave rebellion in the island's history. 20,000 slaves from over 70 plantations rebelled. Whites were driven off of plantations, yet mass killings were avoided. Later termed Bussas Rebellion after the slave ranger Bussa who with his assistants hated slavery, found the treatment of slaves on Barbados to be intolerable, and believed the political climate in Britain made the time ripe to peacefully negotiate with planters for freedom (Davis, p. 211, Northrup, p. 191). Brussas Rebellion failed. 120 died in combat or were immediately executed; another 144 were brought to trial and executed; remaining rebels were shipped off the island (Davis, pp. 212-213). Slavery was abolished in the British Empire 18 years later in 1834. In Barbados and the rest of the British West Indian colonies, full emancipation from slavery was preceded by an apprenticeship period that lasted four years.   In 1884, the Barbados Agricultural Society sent a letter to Sir Francis Hincks requesting his private and public views on whether the Dominion of Canada would favourably entertain having the then colony of Barbados admitted as a member of the Canadian Confederation. Asked of Canada were the terms of the Canadian side to initiate discussions, and whether or not the island of Barbados could depend on the full influence of Canada in getting the change agreed to by Britain. Then in 1952 the Barbados Advocate newspaper polled several prominent Barbadian politicians, lawyers, businessmen, the Speaker of the Barbados House of Assembly and later as first President of the Senate, Sir Theodore Branker, Q.C. and found them to be in favour of immediate federation of Barbados along with the rest of the British Caribbean with complete Dominion Status within five years from the date of inauguration of the West Indies Federation with Canada.   However, plantation owners and merchants of British descent still dominated local politics, owing to the high income qualification required for voting. More than 70% of the population, many of them disenfranchised women, were excluded from the democratic process. It was not until the 1930s that the descendants of emancipated slaves began a movement for political rights. One of the leaders of this movement,  Sir Grantley Adams , founded the  Barbados Labour Party , then known as the  Barbados Progressive League , in 1938. Though a staunch supporter of the monarchy, Adams and his party demanded more rights for the poor and for the people. Progress toward a more democratic government in Barbados was made in 1942, when the exclusive income qualification was lowered and women were given the right to vote. By 1949 governmental control was wrested from the planters and, in 1958, Adams became Premier of Barbados.   From 1958 to 1962, Barbados was one of the ten members of the  West Indies Federation , an organisation doomed by nationalistic attitudes and by the fact that its members, as colonies of Britain, held limited legislative power. Adams served as its first and only ""Prime Minister"", but his leadership failed in attempts to form similar unions, and his continued defence of the monarchy was used by his opponents as evidence that he was no longer in touch with the needs of his country.  Errol Walton Barrow , a fervent reformer, became the new people's advocate. Barrow had left the BLP and formed the  Democratic Labour Party  as a liberal alternative to Adams' conservative government. Barrow instituted many progressive social programmes, such as free education for all Barbadians, and the School Meals system. By 1961, Barrow had replaced Adams as Premier and the DLP controlled the government.   With the Federation dissolved, Barbados had reverted to its former status, that of a  self-governing colony . The island negotiated its own independence at a constitutional conference with the United Kingdom in June 1966. After years of peaceful and democratic progress, Barbados finally became an independent state within the  Commonwealth of Nations  on  November 30 ,1966, with Errol Barrow its first Prime Minister.           Main article:  Politics of Barbados       Barbados has been an independent state in the  Commonwealth  since  November 30 , 1966. It functions as a  parliamentary democracy  modeled on the British  Westminster system . Its  Parliament  comprises thirty seats. The present government is proposing that Barbados become a  republic  within the  Commonwealth of Nations , with a ceremonial  president  replacing the  British Sovereign . This issue is still being hotly debated, as the island has been stable and governmentally autonomous for decades and the Crown's position is strictly nominal.   Barbados is a full and participating member of the  Caribbean Community  (CARICOM), the  Caribbean (CARICOM) Single Market and Economy  (CSME), the  Caribbean Court of Justice  (CCJ), which currently pertains only to Barbados and  Guyana  but is expected to replace the UK  Privy Council  for the entire English-speaking Caribbean eventually, and the  Association of Caribbean States  (ACS).   Barbados has a two party system, the two dominant parties being the ruling  Barbados Labour Party  and the  Democratic Labour Party . The Barbados Labour Party (BLP) has been in government for fifteen years, since the year 1993. It is commonly referred to as the Owen Arthur Administration. The current Prime Minister, The Right Honourable Owen S. Arthur has been delegated the responsibility of being the Regional Leader of the CSM (Caribbean Single Market).                Beach near Bridgetown, Barbados.           Main article:  Geography of Barbados       It is a relatively flat island, rising gently to the central highland region, the highest point being  Mount Hillaby , in the  Scotland   district , at 336 metres (1,100 ft) above sea level. The island is located in a slightly excentric position in the  Atlantic Ocean , to the east of the other  Caribbean  islands. The  climate  is tropical, with a rainy season from June to October.   Barbados is often spared the worst effects of the region's tropical storms and  hurricanes  during the rainy season as its far eastern location in the  Atlantic Ocean  puts it just outside the principal hurricane strike zone, and one only hits about every 26 years.   In the parish of  Saint Michael  lies Barbados' capital and main city,  Bridgetown . Locally  Bridgetown  is sometimes referred to as ""The City,"" but the most common reference is simply ""Town"". Other towns scattered across the island include  Holetown , in the parish of  Saint James ;  Oistins , in the parish of  Christ Church .   It is geologically composed of coral (90 m thick). The land falls in a series of ""terraces"" in the west and goes into an incline in the east. Most of Barbados is circled by coral reefs.   Also the geography serves as a setting for a moderate tropical climate with only two seasons; dry and wet. The dry season (Dec-May) and wet (June- Nov) leaves the precipitation with about 40-90 inches of rain with all the different land types included.           Main article:  Parishes of Barbados              Map of the parishes of Barbados       Barbados is currently  divided  into eleven administrative  parishes :     Christ Church   Saint Andrew   Saint George   Saint James   Saint John   Saint Joseph   Saint Lucy   Saint Michael   Saint Peter   Saint Philip   Saint Thomas             Main article:  Economy of Barbados       Historically, the economy of Barbados had been dependent on  sugarcane  cultivation and related activities, but in recent years it has diversified into the  manufacturing  and  tourism  sectors. Offshore finance and information services have become increasingly important foreign exchange earners, and there is a healthy light manufacturing sector. In recent years the Government has been seen as business-friendly and economically sound. Since the late 1990s the island has seen a construction boom, with the development and redevelopment of hotels, office complexes, and homes.   The government continues its efforts to reduce  unemployment , encourage direct foreign investment, and privatize remaining state-owned enterprises. Unemployment has been reduced from around 14 percent in the past to under 10 percent currently.   The economy contracted in 2001 and 2002 due to slowdowns in tourism, consumer spending and the impact of the  September 11, 2001, attacks , but rebounded in 2003 and has shown growth since 2004. Traditional trading partners include  Canada , the  Caribbean Community  (especially  Trinidad and Tobago ), the  United Kingdom  and the  United States .   Business links and investment flows have become substantial: as of 2003 the island saw from Canada  C$ 25 billion in investment holdings, placing it as one of Canada's top five destinations for Canadian  Foreign Direct Investment  (FDI). Businessman  Eugene Melnyk  of  Toronto , Canada, is said to be Barbados' richest permanent resident.   In 2004, it was announced that Barbados'  Kensington Oval  would be one of the final venues hosting the  2007 Cricket World Cup .   It is thought that the year 2006 will turn out to have been one of the busiest years for building construction ever in Barbados, as the building-boom on the island has entered a final stage for several multi-million dollar projects across the island.  [2] . Barbados could also be said to be a market economy based largely on tourism, and like said before, sugar. The use of agriculture is only a very small percentage of the work force. [ citation needed ]           Main article:  Transport in Barbados       Transport on the island is good, with 'route taxis', called ""ZR's"" (pronounced ""Zed-Rs"" not ""Zee-Rs""), travelling to most points on the island. These small buses can at times be crowded, but will usually take the more scenic routes to destinations. They generally depart from the capital  Bridgetown  or from  Speightstown  in the northern part of the island.   The island of Barbados has a single major airport, the  Sir Grantley Adams International Airport (GAIA)  ( IATA  identifier  BGI ). It receives daily flights by several major airlines from points around the globe, as well as several smaller regional commercial airlines and charters. The airport serves as the main air-transportation hub for the Eastern Caribbean. It is currently undergoing a US$100 million upgrade and expansion.   There are three bus systems running seven days a week (though less frequently on Sundays), and a ride on any of them costs $1.50 BBD. The smaller buses from the two privately-owned systems (""ZRs"" and ""minibuses"") can give change; the larger blue and yellow buses from the government-operated  Barbados Transport Board  system cannot. Most routes require a connection in Bridgetown. Some drivers within the competitive privately owned systems are reluctant to advise you to use competing services, even if those would be more suitable.   Competition for patrons extends to the bus terminals (sometimes just a parking lot full of buses) Some hotels also provide visitors with shuttles to points of interest on the island from outside the hotel lobby. The island also has plenty of taxis for hire, though they can be expensive. Visitors also have the option of transport by car, presuming that they have a driver's licence (issued in their native country). There are several locally-owned and -operated vehicle rental agencies in Barbados but there are no multi-national car-rental agencies such as Avis, Europcar or Hertz.   There is also a helicopter shuttle service, which offers air taxi services to a number of sites around the island, mainly on the West Coast tourist belt.           Main article:  Tourism in Barbados       The island is well developed, and there are internationally-known hotels offering world-class accommodation. Time-shares are available, and many of the smaller local hotels and private villas which dot the island have space available if booked in advance. The southern and western coasts of Barbados are popular, with the calm light blue Atlantic Ocean and their fine white and pinkish sandy beaches. Along the island's east coast the  Atlantic Ocean  side are tumbling waves which are perfect for light  surfing , but a little bit risky due to under-tow currents. The 'Soup Bowl' near to Bathsheba is a very popular spot with surfers all year round.   Shopping  districts are popular in Barbados, with ample duty-free shopping. There is also a festive night-life in mainly tourist areas such as the  Saint Lawrence Gap . Other attractions include wildlife reserves, jewellery stores,  scuba diving , helicopter rides,  golf ,  festivals  (the largest being the annual crop over festival July/Aug), sightseeing, cave exploration, exotic  drinks  and fine  clothes   shopping .       Tourism accounts for the for almost one half of the economy.

Close to 90 percent of all Barbadians (also known colloquially as  Bajan ) are of  African  descent (""Afro-Bajans""), mostly descendants of the  slave  labourers on the sugar plantations. The remainder of the population includes groups of  Europeans  (""Anglo-Bajans"" / ""Euro-Bajans"") mainly from  Britain ,  Ireland , Chinese locally known as Bajan-Chiney, Bajan Hindus from  India  and Muslims from  Bangladesh  and  Pakistan , and an influential ""Arab-Bajans"" group mainly of  Syrian  and  Lebanese  descent. On the island are many people of  Creole  descent, a mixture of Afro-Caribbean and European descent (Primarily British, Portuguese, Irish); many Afro-Bajans are of creole descendency.   Other groups in Barbados include people from the  United States ,  Canada ,  United Kingdom  and  expatriates  from  Latin America . Barbadians who return after years of residence in the U.S. are called ""Bajan Yankees""; this term is considered derogatory by some.   The country's official language is  English , the local dialect of which is referred to as  Bajan , spoken by most. In religion, most Barbadians are  Protestant   Christians  (67%), chiefly of the  Anglican Church , but there are other Protestant,  Roman Catholic ,  Jehovah's Witness ,  Hindu ,  Muslim  and  Jewish  minorities. Barbados is currently a chief destination for emigrants from the  South American  nation of  Guyana . The biggest communities outside the Afro-Caribbean community are:     The  Indo-Guyanese , an important part of the economy due to the increase of immigrants from partner country  Guyana . There are reports of a growing Indo-Bajan diaspora originating from Guyana and  India . They introduced Soca-Chutney,  Roti  and many Indian dishes to Barbados' culture. Mostly from southern India and Hindu states, these 'Desi' peoples are growing in size but smaller than the equivalent communities in Trinidad & Guyana; Hinduism is one of Barbados' growing religions.   Euro-Bajans have settled in Barbados since the 1500s, originating from  England ,  Ireland  and  Scotland . More commonly they are known as "" White Bajans "", although some carry Afro-Caribbean traces and vice-versa. Euro-Bajans introduced folk music, such as  Irish music  and Highland music, and certain place names, such as ""Scotland"", a mountainous region, and ""Trafalgar Square"" in Bridgetown, now renamed ""Heroes Square"".   Latinos and Hispanics: a very small minority. They come from countries such as  Puerto Rico  and  Dominican Republic  and have been steadily on the increase while  Brazilians  and Venezuelans have been in Barbados since as far back as the 1800s. Some  Samba ,  Merengue  and  Reggaeton  has been introduced by the Latin Americans as a sub-culture.   Chinese -Barbadians (or, as they are known on the island, ""Bajan-Chineys"") are a small portion of Barbados' Asian demographics, smaller than the equivalent communities of  Jamaica  and  Trinidad . Most if not all first arrived in the 1940s during the Second World War, originating mainly from the then British territory of  Hong Kong . Many Chinese-Bajans have the surnames Chin, Chynn or Lee, although other surnames prevail in certain areas of the island. Chinese food and culture is becoming part of everyday Bajan culture.   Lebanese and Syrians are the middle eastern community on the island and make up 89% of the Muslim population. Middle-Eastern Barbadians are often perceived to be the most successful group in business, along with the Chinese Bajans. During the  Arab Israeli Wars , many Syrians and Lebanese headed for the West Indies to escape conflict and poverty in the  Middle East . Also Jewish people arrived in Barbados around the same time, creating the biggest synagogue in the West Indies.             Main article:  Culture of Barbados     See also:  Music of Barbados     The influence of the English on Barbados is more noticeable than on other islands in the West Indies. A good example of this is the island's national sport:  cricket . Barbados has brought forth several great cricket players, including  Garfield Sobers  and  Frank Worrell .   Citizens are officially called Barbadians; Barbados' residents, however, colloquially refer to themselves or the products of the country as ""Bajan"". The term ""Bajan"" may have come from a localized pronunciation of the word Barbadian which at times can sound more like ""Bar-bajan"".   The largest  carnival -like cultural event which takes place on the island is the  Crop Over  festival, second only in size to the carnival held in  Trinidad and Tobago . [ citation needed ]   As in many other Caribbean and Latin American countries,  Crop Over  is an important event for many people on the island, as well as the thousands of tourists that flock to the island to participate in the annual events.   The  Crop Over  festival includes various musical competitions and other traditional activities. It gets under way from the beginning of July, and ends with the costumed parade on Kadooment Day, held on the first Monday of August.   Barbados  retains a strong British  influence  and is referred to by its neighbours as ""Little  England "".           Main article:  Sports in Barbados       Several sports are played in Barbados. As in other Caribbean countries, cricket is a favorite sport. In addition to several warm-up matches and six ""Super Eight"" matches, Barbados hosted the final of the  2007 Cricket World Cup .   In golf, the  Barbados Open  is an annual stop on the  European Seniors Tour . In December 2006 the  WGC-World Cup  took place at the country's  Sandy Lane  resort on the Country Club course, an eighteen-hole course designed by  Tom Fazio .                    A yellow and red Poinciana.       The national flower is the Pride of Barbados or  Caesalpinia pulcherrima  (L.) Sw., which grows across the island.          Barbados' coat of arms.           The trident centered within the flag is a representation of the mythological Neptune, god of the sea. The trident in its original unbroken form was taken from the former colonial seal, which itself was replaced by the current coat of arms. Used within the national flag, the left and right shafts of the trident were then designed as 'broken' representing the nation of Barbados breaking away from its historical and constitutional ties as a former colony.   The three points of the  trident  represent in Barbados the three principles of  democracy  - ""government of, for and by the people.""   The broken trident is set in a centered vertical band of gold representing the sands of Barbados' beaches. The gold band itself is surrounded on both sides by vertical bands of ultramarine (blue) representing the sea and sky of Barbados.   The design for the flag was created by Grantley W. Prescod and was chosen from an open competition arranged by the Barbados government. Over a thousand entries were received. [3]       The Golden Shield in the coat of arms carries two "" Pride of Barbados "" flowers and the ""bearded"" fig tree ( Ficus citrifolia  or  Ficus barbata ), which was common on the island at the time of its settlement by the British and may have contributed to Barbados being so named.       The  coat of arms  depicts two animals which are supporting the shield. On the left is a "" dolphin "", symbolic of the fishing industry and sea-going past of Barbados. On the right is a  pelican , symbolic of a small island named  Pelican Island  that once existed off the coast of Bridgetown. Above the shield is the helmet of Barbados with an extended arm clutching two  sugar-cane  stalks. The ""cross"" formation made by the cane stalks represents the cross upon which  Saint Andrew  was crucified. On the base of the Coat of Arms reads ""Pride and Industry"" in reference to the country's motto.       There are ten Barbadian national heroes: [4]     Sir Grantley Adams  ( [3  "

At roughly 13 North and 59 West, the country lies in the southern  Caribbean  region, where it is part of the Lesser Antilles island-chain. Barbados is relatively close to the  South American  continent, around 434 kilometers (270 miles) northeast of  Venezuela . Its closest island neighbors are  Saint Lucia  and  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  to the west,  Grenada  to the south-west, and  Trinidad and Tobago  to the south, with which Barbados now shares a fixed official maritime boundary.   Barbados' total land area is about 430 square kilometers, (166 square miles), and is primarily low-lying, with some higher regions in the island's interior. The organic composition of Barbados is thought to be of non-volcanic origin and is predominantly composed of  limestone - coral . The island's climate is  tropical  with constant trade winds off the Atlantic Ocean serving to keep temperatures mild. Some more undeveloped areas of the country contain woodland and scrubland. Other parts of the interior which contribute to the agriculture industry are dotted with large sugarcane estates and wide, gently sloping pastures, with many good views down to the sea coast.   Barbados has one of the highest standards of living and literacy rates in the world. Despite its small size, Barbados constantly ranks in the top 35 countries in the Human Development Index (HDI) rankings. It is currently ranked third in the Americas. The island is also a major tourist destination.

Portugal was the first European country to ""discover"" and name the island. As early as 1511, the island is referred to as Isla de los Barbados (island of the bearded ones) in an official Portuguese document. It is a matter of conjecture whether the word ""bearded"" refers to the long, hanging roots of the bearded fig-tree  (Ficus citrifolia),  indigenous to the island, to bearded Amerindians occupying the island, or to the foam spraying over the outlying reefs giving the impression of a beard.   Barbados is grouped as an island of the Lesser Antilles, although it is not strictly a part of the Lesser Antilles due to its different geological formation. It is situated 480 kilometers north of  Guyana , 160 kilometers east of  St. Vincent . This isolated pear-shaped island extends for 34 kilometers along a north-south axis and has a maximum breadth of 23 kilometers, giving it a total land area of 430 square kilometers.   Barbados is fringed with  coral  reefs. The island itself is characterized by lowlands or gently sloping, terraced plains, separated by rolling hills that generally parallel the coasts. Elevations in the interior range from 180 to 240 meters above sea level. Mount Hillaby is the highest point at 340 meters above sea level. Farther south, at Christ Church Ridge, elevations range from sixty to ninety meters.     Eighty-five percent of the island's surface consists of coralline  limestone  twenty-four to thirty meters thick; Scotland District contains outcroppings of oceanic formations at the surface, however. Sugarcane is planted on almost 80 percent of the island's limestone surface. The soils vary in fertility; erosion is a problem, with crop loss resulting from landslides, washouts, and falling rocks. Most of the small streams are in Scotland District. The rest of the island has few surface streams; nevertheless, rainwater saturates the soil to produce underground channels such as the famous Coles Cave.   Barbados lies within the tropics. Its generally pleasant maritime climate is influenced by northeast trade winds, which moderate the tropical temperature. Cool, northeasterly trade winds are prevalent during the December to June dry season. The overall annual temperature ranges from 24C to 28C; slightly lower temperatures prevail at higher elevations. Humidity levels are between 71 percent and 76 percent year round. Rainfall occurs primarily between July and December and varies considerably with elevation. Rainfall may average 187.5 centimeters per year in the higher central area as compared with 127.5 centimeters in the coastal zone.   Barbados is often spared the worst effects of the region's tropical storms and hurricanes during the rainy season as its far eastern location in the  Atlantic Ocean  puts it just outside the principal hurricane belt. The island does get brushed or hit about every three years and the average time between direct hurricane hits is about 26 years.     History   The earliest inhabitants of Barbados were  Native American  nomads. Three waves of migrants moved north toward North America. The first wave was of the Saladoid-Barrancoid group, who were farmers and fishermen and arrived by  canoe  from  South America  ( Venezuela 's  Orinoco Valley ) around 350  C.E.  The  Arawak  people were the second wave of migrants, arriving from South America around 800  C.E.  Arawak settlements on the island include Stroud Point, Chandler Bay, Saint Luke's Gully and Mapp's Cave. According to accounts by descendants of the aboriginal Arawak tribes on other local islands, the original name for Barbados was  Ichirouganaim.  In the thirteenth century, the Caribs arrived from South America in the third wave, displacing both the Arawak and the Salodoid-Barrancoid. For the next few centuries, the Caribslike the Arawak and the Salodoid-Barrancoidlived in isolation on the island.   Portuguese Conquistadors seized many Caribs on Barbados and used them as slave labor on plantations. Other Caribs fled the island.   British sailors who landed on Barbados in 1625, at the site of present-day Holetown on the Caribbean coast found the island uninhabited. From the arrival of the first British settlers in 1627-28 until independence in 1966, Barbados was under uninterrupted British control. Nevertheless, Barbados always enjoyed a large measure of local autonomy. Its House of Assembly began meeting in 1639. Among the initial important British figures was Sir William Courten.   Starting in the 1620s, an increasing number of black slaves were brought to the island. Five thousand locals died of fever in 1647, and hundreds of slaves were executed by Royalist planters during the  English Civil War  in the 1640s, because they feared that the ideas of the Levellers might spread to the slave population if Parliament took control of Barbados.           The Barbadoes Mulatto Girl,  after Agostino Brunias, 1779.       Large numbers of  Celtic  people, mainly from  Ireland  and  Scotland , went to Barbados as indentured servants. Over the next several centuries the Celtic population was used as a buffer between the Anglo-Saxon plantation owners and the larger  African  population, variously serving as members of the Colonial militia and playing a strong role as allies of the larger African slave population in a long string of colonial rebellions. As well, in 1659, the English shipped many Irishmen and Scots off to Barbados as slaves, and  King James II  and others of his dynasty also sent Scots and English to Barbados: for example, after the crushing of the Monmouth Rebellion in 1685. The modern descendants of this original slave population are sometimes derisively referred to as Red Legs, or locally ""ecky becky,"" and are some of the poorest inhabitants of modern Barbados. There has also been large-scale intermarriage between the African and Celtic populations on the islands.   With the increased implementation of slave codes, which created differential treatment between Africans and the white settlers, the island became increasingly unattractive to poor whites. Black or slave codes were implemented in 1661, 1676, 1682, and 1688. In response to these codes, several slave rebellions were attempted or planned during this time, but none succeeded. However, an increasingly repressive legal system caused the gap between the treatment of typically white indentured servants and black slaves to widen. Imported slaves became much more attractive for the rich planters who would increasingly dominate the island not only economically but also politically. Some have speculated that, because the Africans could withstand tropical diseases and the climate much better than the white slave population, the white population decreased. This is inconsistent with the fact that many poor whites simply immigrated to neighboring islands and remained in tropical climates. Nevertheless, as those poor whites who had or acquired the means to emigrate often did so, and with the increased importation of African slaves, Barbados turned from mainly Celtic in the seventeenth century to overwhelmingly black by the nineteenth century.   As the  sugar  industry developed into its main commercial enterprise, Barbados was divided into large plantation estates that replaced the smallholdings of the early British settlers. Some of the displaced farmers moved to British colonies in North America, most notably  South Carolina . To work the plantations, West Africans were transported and enslaved on Barbados and other Caribbean islands. The  slave trade  ceased in 1804. In 1816, the continuation of slavery caused the largest major slave rebellion in the island's history. One thousand people died in the revolt for freedom, with 144 slaves executed and 123 deported by the king's army. Slavery was abolished in the British Empire 18 years later in 1834. In Barbados and the rest of the British West Indian colonies, full emancipation from slavery was preceded by an apprenticeship period that lasted six years.   However, plantation owners and merchants of British descent still dominated local politics, owing to the high income qualification required for voting. More than 70 percent of the population, many of them un-enfranchised women, were excluded from the democratic process. It was not until the 1930s that the descendants of emancipated slaves began a movement for political rights. One of the leaders of this movement, Sir Grantley Adams, founded the Barbados Labour Party, then known as the Barbados Progressive League, in 1938. Though a staunch supporter of the monarchy, Adams and his party demanded more rights for the poor and for the people. Progress toward a more democratic government in Barbados was made in 1942, when the exclusive income qualification was lowered and women were given the right to vote. By 1949, governmental control was wrested from the planters and, in 1958, Adams became Premier of Barbados.   From 1958 to 1962, Barbados was one of the ten members of the West Indies Federation, an organization doomed by nationalistic attitudes and by the fact that its members, as colonies of Britain, held limited legislative power. Adams served as its first and only ""Prime Minister,"" but his leadership failed in attempts to form similar unions, and his continued defense of the monarchy was used by his opponents as evidence that he was no longer in touch with the needs of his country. Errol Walton Barrow, a fervent reformer, became the new people's advocate. Barrow had left the BLP and formed the Democratic Labour Party as a liberal alternative to Adams' conservative government. Barrow instituted many progressive social programs, such as free education for all Barbadians, and the School Meals system. By 1961, Barrow had replaced Adams as Premier and the DLP controlled the government.   With the Federation dissolved, Barbados had reverted to its former status, that of a self-governing colony. The island negotiated its own independence at a constitutional conference with the  United Kingdom  in June 1966. After years of peaceful and democratic progress, Barbados finally became an independent state within the Commonwealth of Nations on November 30, 1966, with Errol Barrow its first Prime Minister.     Politics          The beach in Barbados.       Politics in Barbados takes place in the framework of a parliamentary representative democratic monarchy, whereby the Prime Minister is the head of government of a pluriform multi-party system. The Executive power is exercised by the government while the Legislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of the Parliament. The political system is dominated by two main parties, the Barbados Labour Party and the Democratic Labour Party. The Judiciary of Barbados is independent of the executive and the legislature. Jurisprudence is based on English common law.   The bicameral Parliament of Barbados consists of the House of Assembly and the Senate. The 30 members of the House are elected by universal suffrage to five-year terms. Elections may be called at any time the government wishes to seek a new mandate or if the government suffers a vote of no-confidence in Parliament. The Senate's 21 members are appointed by the governor general12 with the advice of the prime minister, two with the advice of the leader of the opposition, and seven at the governor general's discretion.   After years of peaceful and democratic progress, Barbados became an independent state maintaining full diplomatic ties to the Commonwealth of Nations on November 30, 1966. The overall constitutional safeguards for nationals of Barbados include: Freedom of speech, press, worship, movement, and association. The present government is proposing that Barbados become a republic within the Commonwealth of Nations, with a ceremonial president replacing the British Sovereign. This issue is still being hotly debated, as the island has been governmentally autonomous for decades and the Crown's position is strictly nominal.   Barbados is a full and participating member of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), the Caribbean (CARICOM) Single Market and Economy (CSME), the Caribbean Court of Justice (CCJ), which currently pertains only to Barbados and  Guyana  but is expected to replace the UK Privy Council for the entire English-speaking Caribbean eventually, and the Association of Caribbean States (ACS).   There are two major and long-standing parties in Barbadosthe Barbados Labour Party (BLP) and the Democratic Labour Party (DLP). Recent times have seen the dissolution of a third partythe National Democratic Party (NDP)and the creation of another, the People's National Party (PNP). Despite initial historical disparity (the BLP was once conservative and the DLP liberal), their modern incarnations are all moderate and have no major ideological differences. Electoral contests and political disputes often have personal overtones and voter sway tends to be based on tradition. The major political problems facing Barbados today are in promoting economic growth: Creating jobs, encouraging agricultural diversification, attracting small industry, and promoting tourism.   The ruling BLP was decisively returned to power in January 1999 elections, winning 26 seats, (of the then) available 28 seats in the Parliament with the DLP only winning two seats.   Barbados has been represented by the Barbados Labour Party (BLP) for 14 years, since the year 1993.     Economy          Bottom Bay, Barbados.       Historically, the economy of Barbados had been dependent on  sugarcane  cultivation and related activities, but in recent years it has diversified into the manufacturing and tourism sectors. Offshore finance and information services have become increasingly important foreign exchange earners, and there is a healthy light manufacturing sector. In recent years the Government has been seen as business-friendly and economically sound. Since the late 1990s, the island has seen a construction boom, with the development and redevelopment of hotels, office complexes, and homes.   Offshore finance and informatics are important foreign exchange earners, and there is also a light manufacturing sector. The government continues its efforts to reduce the unacceptably high unemployment rate which it met in the 1990s, encourage direct foreign investment, and privatize remaining state-owned enterprises.   The main factors responsible for the improvement in economic activity include an expansion in the number of tourist arrivals, an increase in manufacturing, and an increase in sugar production. Recently, offshore  banking  and financial services also have become an important source of foreign exchange and economic growth.   Economic growth has led to net increases in employment in the tourism sector, as well as in construction and other services sub-sectors of the economy. The public service remains Barbados' largest single employer. Total labor force has increased from 126,000 in 1993 to 140,000 persons in 2000, and unemployment has dropped significantly from over 20 percent in the early 1990s to 9.3 percent at the end of 2000.   The economy of Barbados is susceptible to various issues. Fluctuations in tourist arrivals has a direct effect on the Barbados economy. In order to stabilize tourism the government has announced an initiative to host one major sporting event per year. In 2006, it was announced that the Sandy Lane Beach Hotel will host the Golf world cup. For 2007 several matches of the Cricket World Cup will be held on the island and the government promises that more big events will be lined up for 2008 and 2009. The Barbados government has also pursued ""home porting"" agreements with several cruise-lines. As part of the deal, the Barbados government negotiates with cruise-lines, tourists fly to Barbados and are transported to the Deep Water Harbor in Bridgetown to begin their Caribbean cruise.     Natural resources   Barbados has considered the sea surrounding the island a natural resource. For centuries oceangoing fleets from Barbados would haul fresh  fish  and other marine species. Barbados was best known for the Flying Fish which at one time more heavily inhabited the warm waters around the island.   Global pricing on fossil fuels also has a direct impact on the Barbados economy. Barbados remains one of the few islands in the Caribbean with an oil/gas field within its territory. The island currently has an exploration agreement with U.S.-based PhilipsConoco (and previously Mobil) around the Oistins, town of Christ Church. Oil and gas supplies in Barbados have been considered small and are used most commonly for local consumption to decrease the need to import some of the island's fuel. Under an agreement with neighboring  Trinidad and Tobago  since the 1990s, the governmentowned Barbados National Oil Company allows all crude to be refined via Trinidad and Tobago's booming oil industry. The Trinidad and Tobago government in turn provides an equivalent amount of processed fuel back to Barbados, minus some oil to recoup the cost of refining. The remainder is returned to Barbados in the end product.   The Government of Barbados refused to sign on to a deal with many of the other Caribbean islands and  Venezuela  known as PetroCaribe, citing it could force local privately owned companies out of business, since PetroCaribe partially seeks to re-nationalize all energy infrastructure. Another factor was that the Barbados economy could not forecast future costs from joining in PetroCaribe.   In an effort to further decrease the island's overdependence on oil, the Government of Barbados is investing in technologies to harness wind power for energy, as well as possibly using more of the islands' unused sugar cane for Ethanol fuel energy, similar to Brazil. [1]     Weather impacts   In 1994-95, Barbados found itself vulnerable to large changes in the earth's weather patterns. A (one in 150 year) drought gripped the entire island, preventing some residents from drawing adequate water supply and delivering a huge blow to the island's  agriculture  industry. In order to prevent a repeat of this event, the island entered into an agreement with the Ionics Co. to build a desalination water plant. After its completion the water plant was able to provide up to one-third of Barbados' total daily water consumption. [2]     Consumer spending   Spending in Barbados continues to be one of the immediate problems to the Barbados economy and the island's cash reserves to peg the currency to the US dollar. Barbadians continue to import large numbers of cars from Asia, despite the government instituting higher duties to discourage spending. As many as 500 cars continue to be added to Barbados' roads every month, increasing chronic traffic problems and forcing the government to back more of this spending in order to maintain high levels in the nation's Foreign exchange reserves. [3]     Demographics   Barbados has a population of about 280,946 (July 2007) and a population growth rate of 0.369 percent. Close to 90 percent of all Barbadians (also known colloquially as  Bajan ) are of  African  descent, mostly descendants of the slave laborers on the sugar plantations. The remainder of the population includes groups of Europeans (mainly from  Britain ,  Ireland ), Chinese, Bajan Hindus from  India , and Muslims from  Bangladesh  and  Pakistan , and an influential ""Arab-Bajans"" group mainly of  Syrian  and Lebanese descent. There are many people of Creole descent, a mixture of Afro-Caribbean and European descent, and many Afro-Bajans do have some British or Scottish antecedents. Other groups in Barbados include people from the  United States ,  Canada , United Kingdom, and expatriates from Latin America.   The country's official language is British English, the local dialect of which is referred to as Bajan, spoken by most. In religion, most Barbadians are  Protestant  Christians (67 percent), chiefly of the  Anglican Church , but there are other Protestant, Roman Catholic, Jehovah's Witness,  Hindu , and  Muslim  minorities. Barbados is currently a chief destination for emigrants from the  South American  nation of  Guyana .     Culture          Beach near Bridgetown, Barbados.       The Barbadian culture is a blend of West African and British cultures. The Bajan, or Barbadian Creole, dialect is an iconic part of the culture. But English is still the official language, reflecting centuries of British rule.   The island's British influence stretches back to 1625, when Captain John Powell claimed it in the name of  King James I . The first colonists arrived two years later, founding a settlement of 80 civilians and ten slaves. Early on, Barbados adopted the British style of government, creating a Parliamentary democracy in 1639. During the colonial period, all members of the Legislative Assembly were white. After slavery was abolished in 1838, non-whites quickly began to play a role in the island's government, with the first minority member elected in 1843. Although Barbados gained full independence from Britain in 1966, it has retained its governmental style and remains a member of the Commonwealth of Nations.   In addition to government, the British passed down their love of cricket. The most popular sport on Barbados, its cricket team has won numerous regional matches. Many players on the team go on to success on the West Indies team to compete in international games. One of the most highly regarded cricket players of all time, Sir Garfield Sobers, is a Barbados native.   The country's architecture pays further testament to Britain, with many historic buildings still standing. In addition to traditional wood and stone,  coral  was also used in construction, lending a unique Barbadian flair. Jacobean, Georgian, and Victorian styles dominate. Slaves constructed many of these buildings, as well as their own chattel houses, and were thus an integral part of the island's architectural legacy. Built of wood, chattel houses were set atop blocks instead of permanent foundations so they could be easily moved from place to place. The vivid colors of these chattel houses exhibits  West African  influence.   Religion plays an important role in life on the island. With its long British ties, the  Anglican  church serves the largest segment of the population. However, Roman Catholic,  Baptist ,  Methodist , and other Christian denominations also support congregations. The Christian population celebrates its deeply-rooted faith in an annual festival, Gospelfest. Smaller  Jewish ,  Hindu , and  Muslim  communities add some religious diversity.   In addition to Gospelfest, Barbados holds many other carnivals and festivals. The Landship is a Barbadian tradition. It mimics and parodies the Royal Navy, while it incorporates music, dance, and games. The largest and most important festival in Barbados is  Crop Over,  which celebrates the end of the sugarcane harvest. Lasting three weeks, it includes fairs, parades, and contests.   The  music  of Barbados is an important part of the country's culture. Modern Barbados has produced popular stars of  calypso  and the indigenous spouge style, and also has a large jazz scene.  Reggae , soca, and tuk are popular as well.   Every January, Barbados hosts the Barbados Jazz Festival. In mid-February, Barbados hosts the Barbados Holetown Festival which celebrates the arrival of the first English settlers.     Sports in Barbados   Several sports are played in Barbados. As in other Caribbean countries, cricket is a favorite sport. In addition to several warm-up matches and six ""Super Eight"" matches, Barbados hosted the final of the 2007 Cricket World Cup. The best Barbadian Cricket players go on to play for the West Indies Cricket Team. The West Indian cricket team, also known colloquially as  The Windies  or  The West Indies,  is a multi-national cricket team representing a sporting confederation of a dozen English-speaking  Caribbean  countries and British dependencies that form the British West Indies.   In golf, the Barbados Open is an annual stop on the European Seniors Tour. In December 2006 the WGC-World Cup took place at the country's Sandy Lane resort on the Country Club course, an eighteen-hole course designed by Tom Fazio.   The Barbados national football team, nicknamed  Bajan Pride,  is the national team of Barbados and is controlled by the Barbados Football Association. It has never qualified for a major international tournament. It came close to qualifying for the 2005 Gold Cup as it hosted the Digicel Cup finals for the Caribbean that acted as Gold Cup qualifiers, but finished fourth of the four teams. In 2001, it surprised many by making the semifinal round of the 2002 World Cup Qualifiers. In the first game of this round, they pulled off a shock 2-1 win over Costa Rica, but lost their five remaining games.     Tourism   The island of Barbados has a single major airport, the  Sir Grantley Adams International Airport (GAIA)  (IATA identifier BGI). It receives daily flights by several major airlines from points around the globe, as well as several smaller regional commercial airlines and charters. The airport serves as the main air-transportation hub for the Eastern  Caribbean . It is currently undergoing a US$100 million upgrade and expansion.   The island is well developed, and there are internationally-known hotels offering world-class accommodation. The southern and western coasts of Barbados are popular, with the calm light blue  Caribbean Sea  and their fine white and pinkish sandy beaches. Along the island's east coast the  Atlantic Ocean  side are tumbling waves which are perfect for light  surfing , but a little bit risky due to under-tow currents. The 'Soup Bowl' near to Bathsheba is a very popular spot with surfers all year round.   Shopping districts are popular in Barbados, with ample duty-free shopping. There is also a festive night-life in mainly tourist areas such as the Saint Lawrence Gap. Other attractions include wildlife reserves, jewelery stores,  scuba diving , helicopter rides,  golf , festivals (the largest being the annual crop over festival July/Aug), sightseeing, cave exploration, exotic drinks and fine clothes shopping.   Transport on the island is good, with ""route taxis,"" called ""ZR's"" (pronounced ""Zed-Rs"" not ""Zee-Rs""), traveling to most points on the island. These small buses can at times be crowded, but will usually take the more scenic routes to destinations. They generally depart from the capital  Bridgetown  or from Speightstown in the northern part of the island.     Notes       Dave Nilles,  Can Ethanol Save the Economy of Barbados?

The first Europeans to arrive in Barbados were the Portuguese, who arrived in the early 16th century. The British arrived shortly after and established formal settlements in the year 1627. Many people who visit the country notice how similar Barbados culture is to British culture. This cultural resemblance dates back the year 1663 when Barbados was declared a British colony. Although Barbados officially gained full independence in the year 1966, the establishment of Barbados as a British colony was an important event in the history of Barbados and continues to have influence on Barbados culture and political climate to this day. Barbados social history includes the enslaving of thousands of Africans who were forced to work on sugar plantations up until the time when slavery was abolished in the mid eighteen hundreds. After the abolishment of slavery, many people, most notably women, faced discrimination. Although the country has worked towards attitudes of equality, the people of Barbados haven’t forgotten the often turbulent Barbados social history.                                     Many people who study  Barbados                           culture wonder how the name “Barbados” came                          about. The word ‘Barbados’ means ‘bearded                          one’ in Portuguese. Some people believe that the                          Portuguese explorers named the country after a large tree                          called the “bearded fig tree.” When the tree                          gets large enough, it resembles a person with a large                          beard. Other experts on the history of Barbados believe                          that Barbados came about when Portuguese sailors who were                          embarking upon Barbados thought that the trees lining                          the coast resembled enormous bearded giants.                                     Despite the ups and downs of Barbados social history, the country’s government today is extremely stable and the economy of Barbados is thriving. Although sugar production has traditionally been a driving force for the economy throughout Barbados history, the Barbados tourism industry has surpassed sugar production as the strongest industry. Oil production is also important to Barbados. Ever since the mid 1990’s, the Barbados government has been actively exploring the coasts for oil.                                     Today, Barbados enjoys a great  transportation                           infrastructure and continues to make progress in its national                          goal: to become the smallest developed nation in the world.                          People from all over the world travel to Barbados to go                           snorkeling ,  diving ,                          and do some tax free  shopping .                          Although Barbados is a modern country in so many ways,                          you can still see pieces of Barbados history in the old                          churches of  Christ Church                           and  Bridgetown . Visitors                          can also learn more about the history of Barbados by taking                          a visit to the Barbados Museum on the south coast of Barbados.                          You’ll see Arawak artifacts that date all the way                          back to 400 B.C. as well as relics from the European discovery                          of Barbados.                                                                                                                                                                                                        contact us              |  travel newsletter              |  travel marketing              |  write for us  |               link to us              |  privacy policy               |  terms of use              |  help                           © 2008  Destination360  All Rights Reserved                                                                                                                  Barbados Map                                    Latest Topics     nice place to stay at Bridg...

Arizona's fish and wildlife belong to all of us, so when someone takes       an over-limit, it's like taking fish off your stringer and putting it on       theirs. Bag and possession limits are designed to give everyone an equal       chance and protect the fishery.

clueweb09-enwp01-65-06611	"                     List of tectonic plate interactions          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search          See  plate tectonics  for a more complete discussion   Tectonic plate  interactions are of three different basic types:     Divergent boundaries  are areas where plates move away from each other, forming either  mid-oceanic ridges  or  rift valleys .   Convergent boundaries  are areas where plates move toward each other and collide. These are also known as compressional or destructive boundaries.    Subduction  zones  occur where an  oceanic  plate meets a  continental  plate and is pushed underneath it. Subduction zones are marked by  oceanic trenches . The descending end of the oceanic plate melts and creates pressure in the  mantle , causing  volcanoes  to form.   Obduction  occurs when the  continental  plate is pushed under the  oceanic  plate, but this is unusual as the relative densities of the tectonic plates favours subduction of the  oceanic  plate. This causes the oceanic plate to buckle and usually results in a new mid ocean ridge forming and turning the obduction into subduction   Orogenic belts  occur where two continental plates collide and push upwards to form large  mountain ranges .       Transform boundaries  occur when two plates grind past each other with only limited convergent or divergent activity.             Contents       1   Divergent boundaries   2   Subduction zones   3   Orogenic belts   4   Transform boundaries               [ edit ]   Divergent boundaries     The  East African Rift  (Great Rift Valley) in eastern Africa   The  Mid-Atlantic Ridge  system separates the  North American Plate  and  South American Plate  in the west from the  Eurasian Plate  and  African Plate  in the east   The  Gakkel Ridge  is a slow spreading ridge located in the  Arctic Ocean   The  East Pacific Rise , extending from the South Pacific to the  Gulf of California   The  Baikal Rift Zone  in eastern  Russia   The  Red Sea Rift   The  Aden Ridge  along the southern shore of the  Arabian Peninsula   The  Carlsberg Ridge  in the eastern  Indian Ocean   The  Gorda Ridge  off the northwest coast of  North America   The  Explorer Ridge  off the northwest coast of North America   The  Juan de Fuca Ridge  off the northwest coast of North America       [ edit ]   Subduction zones     The  oceanic   Nazca Plate  is being  subducted  under the  continental   South American Plate  at a rate of  10 cm  per  year , forming the  Peru-Chile Trench .   Just north of the Nasca Plate, the oceanic  Cocos Plate  is being subducted under the  Caribbean Plate  and forms the  Middle America Trench .   The  Pacific Plate  is being subducted under the  Eurasian  and  Philippine  Plates, the latter subduction zone forming the  Mariana Trench .   The Pacific Plate is also being subducted under the Indo-Australian Plate north and east of New Zealand, but as this  map (109 KB jpg)  illustrates, the direction of subduction reverses south of the  Alpine Fault  where the Indo-Australian Plate starts being subducted under the Pacific Plate.   The  Cascadia subduction zone  is where the oceanic  Juan de Fuca ,  Gorda  and  Explorer  Plates are being subducted under the continental North American plate.       [ edit ]   Orogenic belts     The most dramatic orogenic belt on the planet is the one between the  Indo-Australian Plate  and the Eurasian Plate. The  Himalayas  are forming along this boundary.   The  Alps  have formed due to the interaction of the African Plate and the Eurasian Plate.       [ edit ]   Transform boundaries     The  San Andreas Fault  in  California  is an active transform boundary. The Pacific Plate (carrying the city of  Los Angeles ) is moving northwards with respect to the North American Plate.   The  Queen Charlotte Fault  on the  Pacific Northwest  coast of  North America   The  Motagua Fault , which crosses through  Guatemala , is a transform boundary between the southern edge of the  North American Plate  and the northern edge of the  Caribbean Plate .   New Zealand 's  Alpine Fault  is another active transform boundary.   The  Dead Sea Transform  (DST) fault which runs through the  Jordan River  Valley in the  Middle East .

Jan  9, 2009 Rory Tip Our good friend and fishing Guru, Rory Aikens, has taken sick and left the Fishing Report to his faithful fishing student, me, Jim Harken. We all wish Rory a very speedy recovery and hope that hel be back imparting his fishing knowledge to us soon! In the meantime let talk just a few tips that are always good to remember: 1. Fishing licenses are good for one year from purchase date make sure your license is up to date before you go out on your excursion. Folks, there are always exceptions, I just trying to fill some large shoes and help you out! 2. Check out the savings of a Family and/or Super Conservation license. The Family License is great for married couples and those with kids! The Super Conservation Licenses combine multiple licenses, stamps and tags to give anglers and hunters an outstanding value! 3. Don dump fish or aquatic wildlife in a waterway they aren from. You can really harm the waterway and you reduce our chances to keep fishing opportunities available. Don do it! 4. Watch out for aquatic hitchhikers and don give them a ride to another waterway. Quagga mussels, whirling disease, golden algae and more can all be transferred, so always Clean, Drain and Dry your boat and equipment. 5. Finally, always wear your life jacket when out on the water. Don let a fun fishing trip turn into a sad trip for the rest of us. Plus, think of the all the great fishing youl miss! I know I not as eloquent as Rory in my fishing tips, but I hope these remind you of some of the basics of fishing in Arizona. Remember: Boat Safe, Boat Smart, Boat Sober Clean, Drain and Dry your equipment - and let all hope that Rory gets well soon!   CENTRAL WATERS URBAN LAKES  The new 2009 Urban Fishing Program booklets are now available from Game and Fish Department offices and all authorized license dealers. All Urban waters will receive incentive stockings the week of Jan. 5-10.  These fish include many trout from 13-18 inches with some even over 4 pounds.  On average one in every four trout will be over 13 inches with the remaining fish ranging from 11-12 inches. Fishing is good to excellent for anglers using scented dough baits (such as Power Bait), worms or corn.  Small spinners such as Rooster Tails and Panther Martins, or spoons such as KastMasters and Super Dupers work well for trout in the early morning.  Patience is the key, as the trout bite sporadically throughout the day.  Fishing for catfish, bass and bluegill is poor due to colder water temperatures that slow down the activity of these warm water species.  Trout fishing is good to excellent at Green Valley lakes in Payson with Power Bait, worms and small spinners working best. TEMPE TOWN LAKE  Game and Fish stocked rainbows last week, so the fishing should be good. Plus, yet another low pressure system this weekend should keep the trout biting. Trout can be readily caught using Power Bait on slip sinkers or under a bobber. Worms are always good bait for just about everything in the lake.  Some anglers have been catching limits using corn. Sometimes a bobber is the way to go for the trout other times they like to pluck the worms from a catfish rig.  Be flexiblehey are. Andrew, a Been Fishing reporter, caught a small largemouth and a channel catfish using worms under a bobber.  He had lots of bites but had difficulty hooking the fish. Another Been Fishing reporter, Brandin, caught three bass, one bluegill another sunfish and two yellow bass.  He used a white swim bait for the bass and the rest were caught on a worm under a bobber. Angler report: Where: tempe town lake When: 01/03/09 Caught: 4 trout/ 3 big carp Technique: corn off the bottom  Comments: it was quick to catch the trout, first the carp hit and the fight was on good fight carp was about 10-15 lbs and it was fun. then the trout hit and thats what i came for. Name: pat Email:  kingp7@hotmail.com LAKE PLEASANT  - Water elevation is 1,660 ft, which is 58-percent full and rising. The Agua Fria River was running high last week, providing some nutrient loading. The current will likely attract stripers even though we are a couple of months a least from the spawning time. Don forget that there is a bald eagle nesting closure on the Agua Fria and the access road off Table Mesa Road is closed. Try working the open section of the Agua Fria and target the submerged river channel that is where you will likely locate the huge schools of stripers and whites. For all those who enjoy seeing lots of shorebirds, such as snowy egrets, try in the Humbug Creek area. This area can also be a striper haven and might even hold for nice crappies as well. ROOSEVELT LAKE  - Lake Elevation is 2143 ft (90-percent full). Tonto Creek runoff was at 213 cfs on Jan. 2 while inflow from the Salt River was at 807 cfs. Both the Salt River and Tonto Creek ramped up to spring-like slows last week. These type of flows in winter are slow down the largemouth bass and crappie bite, but can sometimes get the smallmouth bass bite going. However, once things settle down, expect to start finding winter crappie either in open water (large schools that look like upside-down Christmas trees on the graph), or hovering over deep submerged trees and brush. Crappie anglers may have to adjust to the new terrific conditions with lots of submerged brush and trees crappie love wood. Expect lots of floating debris in both ends of the lake. Increased turbidity this time of year could significantly slow down the bite, but will pay dividends in fish productivity later. With any luck, we will have a decent January crappie bite, although additional storms could alter that possibility. APACHE  - Lake elevation is 1907 ft (93-percent full). Over 4,000 smallmouth bass stocked in Apache Lake two weeks ago.  The smallies were in great condition.  Mostly in the 5-7 inch range and there were a few 9-10 inch bass mixed in with a bunch of 4 inch ones.  Thanks to the United Arizona Angler Foundation, which helped purchase and stock these fish.  Game and Fish tagged the fish so as to discern them from other smallmouth bass previously stocked. An experienced angler caught a 1.5 lb largemouth on a jerk bait in 10 minutes of fishing while waiting for the stocking truck to arrive. Don forget that, effective in 2009, there will be a slot limit for Apache Lake bass. CANYON LAKE  Lake elevation is 1,657 ft, which is 94-percent full. When it rains, the steep sides of Canyon Lake often become a paradise of waterfalls. Fly fishermen are doing well at Boulder Recreation area using semi seal leeches and give wooly buggers a try.  This tidbit from AZ Fly Fishing. An angler fished from first light to about 12:30 and used 6 inch swimbaits and had pretty good luck catching bass, one was a 3 pounder.  A white 4 inch grub hooked to a 1/16 oz darter jig head worked well for some smaller bass. Another angler fished about the same timeframe and caught 8 largemouth bass, 3 yellow bass and a smallmouth bass.  All were below 14 inches.  He stated deep reaction baits worked well for him. Don forget that, effective in 2009, there will be a slot limit for Canyon Lake bass. Angler report: Where: Canyon Lake When: 01/01/09 Caught: Trout, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill Technique: Worm on the bottom Comments: Caught trout limit Thursday and Friday within a couple hours between 8-10, after that, the bit completely shut down. Also caught 1lb largemouth, and few blugill using a work on the bottom. Fished right from the campsite. Name: Chad Email:  chadtysick@hotmail.com SAGUARO LAKE  Lake elevation 1524 feet at 91-percent full. A couple anglers had a fantastic day (34 fish in 3 hours) on the lake despite some rain.  If shad are boiling, top water lures are the ticket.  Once the boils disappear try throwing jerkbait towards shore.  Good fishing grounds include the divider reef area, the snags and around Butcher Jones. Another couple anglers caught 16 largemouth bass 3 hours using a variety of techniques including dropshot, jerkbait, Carolina rigs and flipping worms. For you fly fishermen, Butcher Jones is fishing well for trout with Prince nymphs about 35 yards out. Wooly buggers are also worth trying. This info from our friends at AZ Fly Fishing. Don forget that for 2009 and beyond, there will be a slot limit for Saguaro Lake bass. Angler Report: Where: Saguaro Lake When: 01/09/09 Caught: bass Technique: noodleing Comments: good fishing Name: rgbnsfgbn Email:  adufgadgfouia@aol.com BARTLETT LAKE  Lake elevation is 1,757 ft, which is 49-percent full. Flows popped up last week down the Verde - keep a watch out for possible floating debris. Reservoir release was 112 cfs on Jan. 2. Fish are being caught along the walls using a variety of jigs; pumpkin green and watermelon are enticing the bite for some. Anglers are boating a few fish with cranks and drop shot technique but fishing was slow according to a few fishermen last weekend.  Weather was a quite nippy as well. White spinner baits are reported as working well.  Another well informed angler suggests throwing white fat free fingerling shad cranks or similar lures in the shallows.  Be sure to hit the rocks at the bottom to entice the bite.  Other good choices include c-rigged or t-rigged twin tailed skirted lures or smallie beavers in the shallow rocks in less than 15 feet of water in a variety of coves.   HORSESHOE LAKE  -- Lake elevation is at 1,957 feet, 5-percent full.  VERDE RIVER  -- Flows at Tangle Creek were around 450 cubic feet per second on Jan. 2, higher last week. Expect to find the upper end of the lake a little turbid, with a fair amount of floating debris. LOWER SALT RIVER  (below confluence with Verde River) nbsp;SRP was releasing 186 cfs from Saguaro Lake and 112 cfs from Bartlett this week. There were more than 1,500 trout stocked last week in the Phon Du. Sutton and Granite Reef areas. CREEKS  -- With the snowfall and runoff, the waters could be murky and access will likely be tough.     Haigler Creek Access could be tough.   Canyon Creek Access could be tough.   Tonto Creek Access could be tough.   Christopher Creek No reports.   East Verde - No reports   Workman Creek No reports.   HORSETHIEF BASIN LAKE  Probably not worth driving to just for fishing, but it might be worth a visit if you are prowling the Bradshaw Mountains and want to wet a line for some small sunfish or bass. COLORADO RIVER NORTHWEST LAKE POWELL  -- By Wayne Gustaveson, Utah Division of Wildlife: It has been a great fishing season but this is my last regular report for the year. Next week we head up lake for annual gill net sampling, so I won't be able to provide a new reports from my other office - which is Lake Powell. There will be incidental updates through the winter as news worthy events occur.  The yearly summary is very bright. Shad made a tremendous comeback in 2008. They fed the rising generation of game fish left over after the old generation passed out of the picture in shad-poor 2007. Young stripers grew rapidly, doubling in weight from 1.5 to 3 pounds from spring to fall. Some trophy stripers remain and continue to pack on pounds but the bulk of the population weighs in at 3-4 pounds and is primed to produce a bumper crop of stripers in 2009.     Striped bass hatched in 2009 will survive on plankton early in the year and may eat some shad in summer and fall if shad are abundant. The main predatory impact of the new striped bass overpopulation will not be felt until 2010. Striped bass fishing in 2009 will be great for large numbers of 4-pound fish. If shad are scarce, bait fishing will be excellent. If shad are abundant in 2009, then stripers will grow to 6-pounds before the predation induced forage crash occurs in 2010.  Bass, particularly largemouth, were treated to a forest of habitat as the lake rose 45 feet in 2008. Brush that had grown around the lake edge was flooded providing dense cover for largemouth, crappie and bluegill. Copious shad were added to the fish forest resulting in lush habitat and feeding conditions seldom seen in this lake.  Smallmouth hung out on the rocks at the edge of the habitat forest feeding on shad at a leisurely rate and loving it. These conditions were optimum for all sport fish. Bluegill, crappie, walleye, and catfish all excelled. The perfect mix of food and cover was to the liking of all participants, perhaps with one exception.  Here is what's happening. Stripers are feeding quickly during their prime feeding times. At first light and last light there is a brief flurry of feeding. Some of it is on top when five fish splash in unison. These fish are as susceptible to angling as are any stripers when they decide to eat. They grab anything close to their mouth when in feeding mode. The event lasts for about 20 minutes and then its over.  This quick boil is almost impossible to find by running around the lake looking for boils because it is of short duration and happens early when light is not adequate to illuminate a few splashes. Those that have been successful are camped near the action and waiting when the sky lightens in the morning. Once a feeding location is known, an angler could be waiting at the right spot to get 5 quick fish. Find them one day and return to the spot the next for consistent action.  During daylight, fishing is tough with only a random boil that could happen anytime, any place and then not repeat. Spooning is good if a school is found but they move quickly out of the zone. Cooler temperatures will improve spooning results as shad move deep. Do not expect that to happen until November.  Trolling is working near the inflows where shad abundance is high. At Hite and upper San Juan use a deep diver to get down 20 feet and near the lazily moving stripers.  For this week the best bet is to fish for bass around shad schools located in the backs of many brushy coves. Surface lures tossed near brush (with shad) are being whacked with regularity morning and evening. During the day plastic tubes and drop shot shad baits are working on the deep water side of brushy shad coves. Fish 25 feet for best action on keeper sized fish. When fish are fat and fussy the strategy is to make them mad. Shad colored baits blend win well with thousands of shad. Sometime the wild colors of a fire tiger crankbait trigger a reaction when shad colors will not. Go bright and see if the fishing fortunes improve. LEES FERRY  nbsp;Fishing report courtesy Lees Ferry Anglers. Fly Fishing: Fishing was reported as being a little slow on New Year Day. The water came up fast and stayed that way the entire day. Most of the good gravel bars were either taken or under water pretty early. So most were drifting and fishing from the boat. Folks that were wading did OK. Some better than others, I guess that would depend on where you were on the river. I am not sure but I think the flows will change after the 1st of the year. Very uncrowded. Spin Fishing: Glo bugs bounced off the bottom. Also, black and olive jigs were effective today. Stop by and check out the rig for bottom bouncing and we will fill you in on whatever else is happening and fun while you are out there. Fishing Synopsis and Forecast by Terry Gunn 11/12/08 Recent Fishing Conditions: At a time when just about everything you read is bearing bad news, it gives me great pleasure to bring you some good news: The fishing at Lees Ferry is not just good, it great! The fish are in the best shape and size that I have seen in several years and everything points to this being a trend that I expect to continue. Fishing is just going to get better and better as 2009 arrives  Isn it great to hear some good news for a change! Not only is the fishing upriver great but rumor has it that the Walk-in area is fishing extremely well. One other thing; there has been no one hereome up (you can probably book a guide for tomorrow) and see the best fishing in years and you will likely have the river to yourself. Read on for the full story.     LAKE MEAD  Lake Mead water levels continue to creep up to around 1,111 feet above msl.  Fishing remains on the slow side from Temple Bar up through Greggs Basin.  An occasional striper is being caught down below 40-feet on anchovies.     Launching conditions at South Cove have remained nearly the same for the last three months.  The new concrete ramp the National Park Service just completed is two lanes with cones marking the edges. Use caution not to go off the sides of the metal extensions at either side. National Park Service is working to keep the ramp open.     Important notice: With the recent discovery of invasive quagga mussels in Mead, Mohave and Havasu, proper cleaning of all watercraft is critical to help prevent the spread of these invaders.  Please drain and dry your livewell and bilge on land. Drain all the water you can from your engine. Also, inspect your vessel and trailer, removing any visible mussels, but also feel for any rough or gritty spots on the hull. These may be young mussels that can be hard to see.   For more information, go to the Arizona Game and Fish Department's web pages at  www.azgfd.gov  or visit  http://100thmeridian.org/ .   LAKE MOHAVE  nbsp; The lake level is around 639 feet above msl is the current elevation.  Fishing has been slow here as well as at Mead but the stripers that do get caught are fat and happy.   Lots of bass and bluegill located on fish habitat in 10-15 ft.  As the aquatic vegetation has died off, the fish have consolidated around submerged trees and brush.  I have been getting some reports of 5-15 lb stripers being caught in the area of Katherine landing.   Biologists from both Arizona Game and Fish Department and Nevada Division of Wildlife have continued to install fish habitat in both Carp Cove and Box Cove.  The largemouth, bluegill and catfish are really utilizing the new structures.  Additional habitat will be added at several locations over the next two years.  These structures are fish magnets.    There is a wheelchair accessible fishing pier just south of the main launch ramp at Katherine's Landing. If you fish Mohave and are having luck, please e-mail me at  mchmiel@azgfd.gov  so I can share your successes with others.

TOPOCK MARSH  Water level is going down for the winter, so be careful while launching.  The fishing for crappie has picked up a little, but is still on the slow side.  Golden shores and Game and Fish held a kids fishing clinic at five mile landing on Saturday  October  11th.  This is the second year this event has been held.  The kids had fun.  Some catfish and bass were caught.   Game and Fish biologists surveyed the Marsh starting on the week of Jan. 15.  The largemouth bass population was observed to be very healthy, as well as channel catfish.  Crappie were also present, but in smaller numbers.   You can access the marsh by boat at North Dike, Catfish Paradise, and Five-Mile Landing. All three also provide plenty of area for shoreline fishing too. For more information on the marsh, contact the Havasu National Wildlife Refuge at (760) 326-3853 or go to  http://www.fws.gov/southwest/refuges/arizona/havasu/index.html .

SOUTHWESTERN ARIZONA Lake Havasu Fishing Report     Lake Level 447.90   The Striper bite remains fair during the daylight hours using live shad still fished or trolling cut anchovies, ratl traps, pointer 128s or sassy shads with 3/4 leadhead. Better quality fish are being caught during dark hours of the evening or early a.m. using glow or white colored sassy shads, pointer 128s and ratl traps.   Thompson Bay and Havasu Springs are still producing the best catches.  Smallmouth bass fair during the later am and afternoon hours using brown or green pumpkin jigs, curly tail roboworms or 10 to 15 ft. diving crankbaits where bass are actively chasing shad.   This report was provided by  John Galbraith of Anglers Pro Shop Lake Havasu City OUTLOOK FOR SOUTHWESTERN WATERS  (Fall-Winter Outlook 2008-09): Alamo Lake:     The lake elevation continues to be good, at 1115-1118 feet, and both the main and Cholla ramps will be usable.  Largemouth bass are present in all sizes and fishing is expected to be good to excellent throughout the fall.  Recent fisheries surveys showed a significant number of bass growing out of the slot, and there are many smaller fish below the slot.  Apparently we have had very good spawns the past two years, as there are plenty of young bass in the population.  Crappies are also doing well and fishing should be good throughout the fall.  There are an impressive number of channel catfish in Alamo Lake, especially in the upper portion of the lake.  Many of these are on the small side, but there are significant numbers in the 2 to 3-pound size range, as well as occasional individuals of 7 to 8 pounds, and larger.  There are other fish present such as bluegill, redear sunfish, tilapia and carp that are a lot of fun to catch.  During the fall surveys we noted an abundance of decent-sized redear sunfish, up to a pound.  This species commonly reaches sizes of over two pounds, although we have not yet observed redear sunfish of this size in Alamo Lake.  All types of bait, plastics, spinner baits and top-water lures should work.  As the weather cools off, try slowly working plastics in deeper water for bass.  For channel catfish any of the prepared catfish baits will work, as well as chicken livers or your own secret concoctions.     Although the store at Alamo Lake is still closed at this point, the Alamo Lake State Park is planning on having it open by the first of the calendar year.  The store will be operated by the Park.  Gas, bait, ice and limited supplies and tackle will be available.  You should plan on bringing with you any supplies you will need, in case the store does not open as planned, or does not carry what you need.  If you run short of anything, you might be able to pick it up at the Wayside Inn in Wayside, or in Wenden. The certified scale is presently located at the Alamo Lake State Park office, but will likely be moved to the store (which is located in the same location as the old store), once that facility is open.   Angler report:   Where: Alamo When: 01/02/09 Caught: Catfish Technique: Worm on Red and Green Jig heads Comments: My son and I got on the lake about 11:00 a.m. fished in a bay with no luck, we went to a tree at the mouth of the bay. Dropped the jig head with worm down into the tree. My son caught 17 and I caught 21 we missed about 20 they hit like Bluegil real light. All were 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 pound. We let them all go back to grow to 5 & 6 pounders  Name: Bob Zvara Email:  rrfab@cox.net   Where: Alamo When: 01/03/09 Caught: Afternoon Technique: Junebug colored Berkley worms. Comments: Cove on North side of lake. Caught 3 large mouth bass. Caught 1 catfish on live worm. Name: Monty Email:  msiren108@cox.net   Lake Havasu & Topock Gorge:    Fishing for largemouth bass, as well as smallmouth bass, is expected to be good to excellent. Sizes will range from 13 inches and up, with an occasional fish greater than 4 pounds. Striped bass will continue to be excellent for small fish (12-18 inches) with occasional fish over 8 pounds. Channel catfish as well as bluegill and redear sunfish will be fair to good. Flathead catfish fishing should be fair at the lower end of the lake (Bill Williams River Arm) throughout the fall. Flathead catfish can reach 40 pounds or better in the lower portion of the lake. When fishing for them select the interior points in the coves and the areas where artificial structure has been placed.    The cooler weather causes the bite to slow down, so it is important to work your lures more slowly, and in deeper water.  Put away your topwater lures and switch to plastics, crank baits, spinner baits, jigs, etc.      Colorado River  (Parker Strip Area):    Smallmouth bass with fish over two pounds in size are expected to be fair this fall.  In addition, redear sunfish should also be fair in the pound-plus sizes.   The Parker Strip is well known for its smallmouth bass fishing, especially in the area from the dam to several miles downstream.  The Parker Strip is also home to some really impressive, dinner-plate sized redear sunfish of two pounds or larger.  Channel and flathead catfish fishing is always fair in this section of the Colorado River.  Below the dam, striper fishing should also be fair, using live shad or anchovies this fall.   Colorado River  (between Palo Verde Diversion Dam and Walter's Camp):    This area should be fair for both smallmouth bass (in the channel) and largemouth bass (in the backwaters) throughout the entire area. Channel and flathead catfish are always fair to good in this section of the Colorado River. Most of the flathead catfish will be in the 2 to 5 pound size range with an occasional fish over 30 pounds. The time for fishing for both species of catfish is in the evening to midnight.      Colorado River  (between Walter's Camp and Picacho State Park):    This section of the Colorado River is relatively remote and can only be accessed by boat from either end. Fishing is expected to be fair to good for flathead catfish with sizes over 40 pounds. The best time for fishing for both species of catfish will be in the evening to midnight.  Largemouth bass and bluegill are also present in the various backwaters and slack water areas. Other species available in the main river are smallmouth bass, and striped bass.    Colorado River  (between Picacho State Park and Imperial Dam):    This area is expected to be fair to good for largemouth bass, channel catfish, and flathead catfish. Bass and channel catfish in excess of 5 pounds are present along with flathead catfish as large as 40 pounds, or larger.  Bluegill are also present in the various backwaters and an occasional striped bass will be caught in the main river channel.    Colorado River  (between Laguna and Morelos dams):    This area will be fair for largemouth bass and flathead catfish. Bass in excess of 5 pounds are common and flathead catfish over 20 pounds are a good bet. In this area accessibility to the river is dependent on the amount of water being released. Usually shallow draft boats work the best. The lower end has had some dredging work done and larger boats may be able to get on the river in that area.   With the increase in border issues and illegal activity on the lower end of this stretch, we recommend exercising extreme caution, avoiding nighttime use, or even staying away from the area altogether (Pilot Knob to Moreles Dam).    Regional Hot Spots:   Alamo Lake will be the hot spot for largemouth bass and channel catfish.  There are many fish in the lake at the present time (especially channel catfish), and keeping some to eat will not impact the population in the slightest, and will perhaps even enhance it.  Next choice would be Lake Havasu for striped bass, Lake Havasu and the Parker Strip for smallmouth bass, and Martinez Lake and Imperial Division backwaters for largemouth bass.   For the die-hard flathead catfish angler, large catfish can still be caught from Walter Camp down to Imperial Dam, although fishing likely won be as effective as in the warmer months.   If you need any additional information or assistance don't hesitate to contact the Yuma Regional office at (928) 341-4052 and we will be happy to give you whatever information we have.

WEST CLEAR CREEK  nbsp;No report.  Has been stocked this season. STONEMAN LAKE  NO FISH.  Verde Valley   DEAD HORSE STATE PARK  Fishing in general has been very good.  Some anglers are catching their limit in as little as 15 minutes.  Trout were stocked for five weeks consecutive weeks in November and December.  Trout were stocked again last week and are scheduled to be stocked next week as well(the week of January 12th).  3,033 rainbow trout are split between the lower and middle lagoons each stocking.  The stockings have been so frequent that any day is a good day to fish, even the day before the stockings.  Try using white PowerBait or small spinners.     Catfish were last stocked on September 17th in both the middle and lower lagoons.  Verde River day festivities on September  27th  were a success with around 300 people attending.  As the water temperature continues to cool, the bass, bluegill and catfish become less active.     VERDE RIVER  (throughout Verde Valley) rout were stocked last the week of December 22nd.  They are scheduled to be stocked again this week, the week of January 5th.  2,400 rainbows were stocked into our four sites.  Those sites are Tuzigoot Bridge, just down from the Deadhorse Bridge or acks Bignotti Beach or the Thousand Trails site, and the bridge out of Camp Verde.      Prescott Area: FAIN LAKE  Trout were last stocked December 15th.   1,175 rainbow trout went in without a hitch.  Trout  are scheduled to be stocked again this week, the week of January 5th.     Anglers targeting trout were successful. Trout fishing is best immediately following the stocking.  Powerbait is usually the hot ticket.  Catfish and sunfish were stocked the week of June 23.  Anglers are still having some limited success catching some of those catfish, but it is fairly slow.  Try using night crawlers for the catfish. The sunfish will bite on meal worms or small worms.  Panther Martins are working well for the sunfish.  For trout try using spinners or bright colored Power Bait.     GOLDWATER LAKE  rout were stocked on November 11th.  1,350 plus incentive sized trout were put in around the boat launch.  So some 1-2 pounders could be waiting for you at Goldwater.  This was the last scheduled stocking until the spring.  You may want to try using KastMasters.  If that does not work, try worms or Power Bait.  Some days the fishing seems to be better than other days as well. Catfish and bass were stocked the week of Sept. 15th.     Game and Fish biologists weighed a 22-pound channel catfish that was caught at Goldwater in March.  On July 11, a 26-pound catfish was caught on a hotdog and an 11-pound catfish was caught since then.  While the number of catfish is low, the quality is exceptional.  Bluegills were stocked Feb 25.     Game and Fish Biologists surveyed Goldwater on September 16th, 2008  and found the trout and sunfish plentiful. While the number of catfish was low, the quality was exceptional. One 19lbs and a 14lbs catfish was sampled and released. No bass were sampled this year. If you fish Goldwater and are having luck, please e-mail me at  mchmiel@azgfd.gov  so I can share your successes with others.   GRANITE BASIN  - Bluegill and bass are plentiful in this lake.  The aquatic vegetation has not been bad this year making fishing this lake easier than normal. The bite should be pretty slow all winter.  If you fish Granite Basin and are having luck, please e-mail me at  mchmiel@azgfd.gov  so I can share your successes with others.   LYNX LAKE  Rainbow trout were stocked November 4th.  This was the last scheduled stocking until the week of February 2nd.  Sub-catchable brook trout were stocked on September 24th.  Some anglers were having luck in about 18-feet of water near the spillway at the dam using nightcrawlers.  Some of the brook trout that were stocked in February are still showing up.  Try using chartreuse Power Bait on the bottom for these pretty little fish.  Catfish were stocked June 9 and again on June 25.  Try using night crawlers or hot dogs for the catfish.     Game and Fish Biologists installed PVC fish structures on Jan. 3.  These structures should protect small fishes from predation.  Some 7-inch brook trout were in February and 5-inchers in September. Game and Fish stocked catfish the week of June 4. There were 200 pounds of bluegill stocked on March 29. Game and Fish biologists surveyed Lynx in May and found that the brook trout stocked in September 2006 were still present.   MINGUS LAKE  Mingus was stocked the week of October 20th.  This was the last scheduled stocking until spring.  The best bait has been orange or pink Power Bait, fished on the bottom with a treble hook and an egg sinker. Fishermen using night crawlers grass hoppers and flies have also reported doing well.    Someone illegally stocked yellow bullhead into Mingus several years ago.  These fish compete directly with the trout and keep growth rates very low.  If you witness anyone, anywhere, moving fish like bass, bluegill, catfish and stocking them, please report it to our Operation Game Thief Hotline at 1-800-352-0700.  Illegal stockings cost YOU money!   WATSON  NO NEW REPORTS: Bass, Bluegill and catfish are common in this lake. One angler reported seeing several 5lb catfish recently.  Another angler reported catching 3-8 nice bass per evening on green or chartreuse oolly bugers.nbsp; As the water begins to cool this will slow, so get them while you can.  Crappies are found in low numbers. Bullheads are easily caught using a small piece of worm.     Game and Fish Biologists surveyed Watson on September 17th, 2008  and found the bass,  sunfish, and bullhead to be plentiful.  Crappie are also doing well.  Look for the crappie fishing to pick up in a year or two. If you fish Watson and are having luck, please e-mail me at  mchmiel@azgfd.gov  so I can share your successes with others.   WILLOW CREEK RESERVOIR  NO NEW REPORTS: Bass, bluegill, and bullhead are plentiful.  Most of the bluegills are on the small side, but the bullhead are thick.  If you fish Willow and are having luck, please e-mail me at  mchmiel@azgfd.gov  so I can share your successes with others.

Entry forms for your big fish catches can be found in copies of the current Arizona Fishing Regulations booklet or Urban Fishing Program brochure.Records are maintained for kept fish and catch and release fish categories.   URBAN FISHING REPORT  Fishing for trout is good to excellent at most Urban Fishing Program waters.The January 9 annual incentive stocking of bonus sized fish has brought a lot of excitement to anglers over the past few weeks.In addition to numerous trout in the 18-20 inch range, a 23-inch monster weighing 5.3 pounds was caught on a Super Duper lure from Water Ranch Lake in Gilbert.Urban Fishing Program biologists report a whopper in the 7-pound range was stocked at Alvord Lake at Cesar Chavez Park in Phoenix.Anglers using scented dough baits (such as PowerBait), worms fished under a bobber, or small trout lures have been successful.Best times to fish for trout generally are early morning, but some anglers have reported excellent fishing late afternoon.Small spinners such as Rooster Tails and Panther Martins, or spoons such as Super Dupers are also working well for trout.Trout fishing is good to excellent at Green Valley lakes in Payson with PowerBait and small spinners working best.

All the fish were just small stockers, 10 inchers or so. The rainbows were the most acrobatic fish I have ever seen when they were caught, jumping out of the water with back flips and all. That part was a lot of fun. We did see a brown trout eat a baby duck that was a shocker and then later had a local tell us that an entire flock of baby mallards were eaten the week before. So there are still some monster brown trout in the lake. Just need to figure out what they will hit on; we tried every thing, large Rapalas, large spoons, huge spinners and yet the small rainbows were hitting large lures. HELLO, TRY BABY DUCK LURE! LOL                    admin  on  June 27th, 2008 at 3:56 pm                   One hundred trout sounds like it ought to be a campfire song  what a haul. Reservation Lake does have huge browns. In fact, the current state record came from there. Early summer, however, is not typically the time to catch them unless you have a four-leaf clover in one hand and a rabbits foot dangling from your key chain. However, your best chance will be at first and last light, or possibly at night when the browns get more active. For those of us broiling in the desert sun, the allure of Reservation Lake at 9,000 feet almost in the shade of Mt. Baldy is almost overwhelming.

Rainbow powerbait & #16 hooks off the bottom. Most were small 10 inches or less but very yummy because the water was still cool.  We had a great time watching birds catch fish! We fished Luna lake the weekend before and my husband caught an 18 inch cut throat and a 20 inch rainbow!                    craig on  August 22nd, 2008 at 11:44 pm                   how did you get up there with the roads are all closed?

Go to   Arizona   Game & Fish Department  website for locations. Children ages 13 years and younger are not required to have a fishing license or to be accompanied by a licensed adult. Anglers fishing for trout with a Class A license must also have a valid Trout Stamp.   Tempe Town Lake has not been specifically designated as part of the Arizona Urban Fishing Program.  Town Lake is   considered a state fishing water, therefore, the Class U (Urban Fishing) License is not valid . For further details on general fishing rules and regulations, please refer to the Arizona Fishing Regulations found at all fishing license dealers and the Town Lake Operations Center.              Lake Stocking      Arizona Game and Fish will attempt to  stock trout  in Tempe Town Lake every month from November through January, depending on water conditions. Warm temperatures do not allow trout stocking, but bass, catfish and sunfish may be caught year-round.

The lake's unique environment makes it an attractive place for running, rowing, sailing, walking, skating and bicycling. To ensure that all these activities remain compatible, the City of Tempe asks that anglers follow some basic etiquette while fishing:       Fish hooks and lures left on the shore can cause a safety hazard. Please dispose of unwanted line, hooks, bait containers or lures in marked     trash containers.     Boats have the right-of-way at Town Lake. For safety’s sake, please do     not cast your line if a boat is within reach.    Fish remains left on the shore can attract insects and create foul smells.     Please do not clean fish at Tempe Town Lake.    It is the goal of the City of Tempe to keep the lake as clean as possible.     Please take all cans, bottles, food packaging, newspapers or other debris to     a marked trash container.    Respect the rights of others enjoying the lake. Keep the volume down on     music or radios.    Please keep a respectful distance between you and other anglers.    Conserve the bounty of Tempe Town Lake. Safely release any fish you do not     intend to eat into the lake right away. Properly care for the fish you want     by keeping them alive or putting them on ice until it is time to take them     home.    Obtain the appropriate fishing licenses and do not exceed the limit of     fish you are allowed to take.     Contact numbers to report violations: Tempe Park Rangers (480) 858-2198; Operation Game Thief      (800)     352-0700.        Back to top   Fish  in Town Lake     While Arizona Game and Fish stocks Tempe Town Lake with trout, anglers can expect to find many other kinds of fish that have made their way to the lake through the Salt River Project canals and Indian Bend Wash. Here are brief descriptions of some fish that might dangle at the end of a hook:   Rainbow Trout  This fish has silvery, very fine scales and a spotted body with a horizontal pink streak on the sides. Most trout are from 9 to 12 inches. These fish are not easily fooled. To successfully catch trout, cover the hook completely and use a clear, fine weight line. Powerbait, salmon eggs, worms and cheese are the most enticing baits. The legal limit is four fish of any size for licensed fishermen and two for children.   Channel Catfish  These fish have spines in the dorsal and pectoral fins and long, whiskery-looking barbels at the mouth. Their bodies are scaleless and their tails are deeply forked. The younger fish are silvery with black spots, while older ones are bluish-black with white bellies. These fish can weigh from 1 to 6 pounds. The legal limit is four fish of any size. To catch these, fish at night, dawn or dusk and use worms, liver, shrimp or hotdogs.   Sunfish  Sunfish have small mouths and short, flat bodies ranging from 4 to 8 inches. The legal limit is 10 fish of any size. These are easily caught using mealworms.   Largemouth Bass  Bass are known by the wide, dark mottled bar on the sides of the body. They tend to be dark green on top and white on the belly. The legal limit of bass is four, but lake biologists prefer these to be released, as the hardy nature of the species allows it to be caught many times. Bass are the only species in the lake with a size limit. They must be at least 13 inches before they can be kept. Bass feed predominantly on other fish, especially bluegill, but they can be caught on crank baits and worms.   Other fish  found in Town Lake are Israeli carp, Threadfin shad, Bluegill,  Yellow bass, Common carp, and Inland silverside minnow.      Fish Habitat   Improvements   Habitat restoration is not limited to the land. Tempe Town Lake receives habitat enhancement for fishing. An ongoing program between the City of Tempe Rio Salado and the Arizona Game and Fish Department improves fish habitat in Tempe Town Lake.     Fish habitat improvements include the building of fish condos (small structures of tubes, palettes) or old Christmas trees placed in 5 to 10 feet intervals along the north edge of the lake. Placement of 10 to 20 structures takes place annually.   The City plans to improve the lake bottom for spawning where the Indian Bend Wash joins the Salt River, particularly in the lake area under the Loop 202 freeway overpass. Within this area the habitat could be improved by placing pea gravel, or small one-inch to five-inch river rock in patches along the lake bottom. The City will also use materials like snow fencing held up by PVC pipe framework, or bundling tires like skirt structures near the Loop-202 freeway pylons. The City works with boating or fishing clubs to adopt the lake for fish habitat improvement projects.

We hope your 2009 resolutions include heading out to your favorite fishing hole more often and experiencing what is shaping up to be a great year for anglers. The new 2009-10 fishing regulations are now available at all Game and Fish offices and at license dealers throughout the state.  Be sure you purchase your 2009 license before heading out.   The weather has warmed up some this week, making it a great time to fish the desert lakes. Saguaro Lake was stocked with trout this week, and Canyon, Tempe Town Lake and the Lower Salt River are all scheduled to get stockings next week. It hard to beat the unique experience of fishing on the scenic Lower Salt, which is just a short drive from the Phoenix Metro area.   Also next week, the Urban Fishing Program will be stocking incentive-size trout at all Urban Fishing Program lakes. These stockings include many trout from 13-18 inches, with some even larger than four pounds. These lakes are great places to introduce youngsters to fishing.   Dead Horse Ranch State Park near Cottonwood continues to be another good spot for trout. This is a pleasant place to spend a day bring your family along for a picnic.   A front moving in this weekend will drop temperatures about 10 degrees and bring some rain or snow to the northern and eastern parts of the state.   2009-10 Fishing Regulations are now available   The newly printed 2009-10 Arizona Fishing Regulations are now available at all fishing license dealers in the state, including all Arizona Game and Fish Department offices. The theme of this year fishing regulations is, ids don remember their best day of watching television./p>  hether it is from a child Christmas wish or your own New Year vow, take your children fishing this coming year. I guarantee the memories you make will outlast the video game he or she wantssaid Fisheries Chief Kirk Young.   Don forget that the 2009 fishing licenses are also available, including family licenses and youth combination licenses available. Just check them out in the easy-to-use regulation booklet.   hanks to Arizona abundant snowpack and superb runoff that filled our lakes to overflowing last year, the fishing prognosis going into 2009 is very good. Recent winter storms also provide the hopeful promise of good things headed our way this coming year,Young said.   Keep in mind that there are some regulation changes also heading your way for 2009-10. The Game and Fish Department has instituted a protective slot limit at Saguaro, Canyon and Apache lakes, where you may have six bass in possession (combination largemouth and smallmouth), of which no more than one  may be between 13 and 16 inches. The slot limit at Roosevelt is also the same as the ones at the other Salt River lakes one bass between 13 and 16 inches may be possessed.   The Game and Fish Commission also took off the bag limits for bass (all species) and catfish (all species) at Mogollon Rim area trout waters, specifically Willow Springs, Woods Canyon Lake, Black Canyon Lake, Bear Canyon Lake, Chevelon Lake, CC Cragin Reservoir (Blue Ridge), Knoll Lake and Long Tom Lake.   This year also institutes something new in the state the first-ever seasonal, blue ribbon roundtail chub fishery. A 4.5-mile segment of Fossil Creek in the Verde Valley will be a catch-and-release-only, artificial fly and lure only, single barbless hook fishery with a seven-month season commencing Oct. 3, 2009.   e are excited about this unique fishery for one of our impressive native fish, the roundtail chub, which has historically been referred to as Verde trout by many anglers,Young said. eep an eye out for information on activities planned for opening day at Fossil Creek in October./p>  CENTRAL WATERS   URBAN LAKES The new 2009 Urban Fishing Program booklets are now available from Game and Fish Department offices and all authorized license dealers. All Urban waters will receive incentive stockings the week of Jan. 5-10.  These fish include many trout from 13-18 inches with some even over 4 pounds.  On average one in every four trout will be over 13 inches with the remaining fish ranging from 11-12 inches. Fishing is good to excellent for anglers using scented dough baits (such as Power Bait), worms or corn.  Small spinners such as Rooster Tails and Panther Martins, or spoons such as KastMasters and Super Dupers work well for trout in the early morning.  Patience is the key, as the trout bite sporadically throughout the day.  Fishing for catfish, bass and bluegill is poor due to colder water temperatures that slow down the activity of these warm water species.  Trout fishing is good to excellent at Green Valley lakes in Payson with Power Bait, worms and small spinners working best.   Angler reports:   Where: Surprise When: 12/20/08 Caught: Nothing Technique: Bobber and bottom, using Berkley Pink trout bait Comments: One Bite, many 4-6 inch fish swimming in shallow. Name: Bryan Smith   Where: Rio Vista When: 12/11/08 Caught: 4 Trout 2 Bluegill Technique: Worms off bottom Comments: Used worms broken in small pieces. Name: Shawn Kilpatrick   Where: Kiwanas When: 12/13/08 Caught: 12 trout, most 14"" one being 16"" Technique: My little secret Comments: Between 8 - 10 in the morning, I had 5. Bit throughout the day, especially before the sun rose and before it set. Also some yellow bass on small crankbaits. Name: Andy   Where: Gilbert Water Ranch When: 12/16/08 Caught: Nothing! Technique: Worms, corn, cast master AND EVEN flys/ FLY ROD Comments: Fishing is poor to nill at water ranch. Although trout have been stocked, fish are full and not hungry! I have been there quite a few times and seen other frustrated fishermen, what going on?  Name: Mike   Where: Rio Vista When: 12/13/08 Caught: Two rainbows Technique: Worms on the bottom Comments: Looks like they will bite anything early in the morning after that it too warm Name: Andrew althaus   Where: Chaparral When: 12/07/08 Caught: 6 trout,1 sunny, 14 inch largemouth Technique: Trout - I was using sunrise Power Eggs in the main lake also in-line spinner and a little jig Comments: Don try to heave it out there just 10 or 20 feet and let it sit Name: Joe C.   TEMPE TOWN LAKE Game and Fish stocked rainbows last week, so the fishing should be good. Plus, yet another low pressure system this weekend should keep the trout biting. Trout can be readily caught using Power Bait on slip sinkers or under a bobber. Worms are always good bait for just about everything in the lake.  Some anglers have been catching limits using corn. Sometimes a bobber is the way to go for the trout other times they like to pluck the worms from a catfish rig.  Be flexiblehey are. Andrew, a Been Fishing reporter, caught a small largemouth and a channel catfish using worms under a bobber.  He had lots of bites but had difficulty hooking the fish. Another Been Fishing reporter, Brandin, caught three bass, one bluegill another sunfish and two yellow bass.  He used a white swim bait for the bass and the rest were caught on a worm under a bobber.   Angler reports:   Where: Tempe Town Lake When: 12/03/08 Caught: Trout and Largemouth Technique: Pink (salmon scent) Power Bait w/ slide sinker, Rooster Tail inline spinner for the trout. Chatterbait and spinnerbait for largemouth.  Comments: 3 stocker trout, south side, boat dock, west of Rural Road Bridge early morning. 2 largemouth bass (including 3 pounder), north side, east of Rural Rd Bridge by condos late morning / noon time.  Name: Bruce Nagata   Where: Tempe Town Lake When: 12/03/08 Caught: Trout Technique: Power Bait (orange and green) fished on the bottom, slip sinker, 4 lb leader, #10 hook Comments: I fished south side of the lake, next to Power Rd Bridge. Got my limit in about 30 minutes and left them biting. Guy next to me kept getting bit using corn as well. Most fish were average, small rainbows  Name: David Czupak   LAKE PLEASANT - Water elevation is 1,660 ft, which is 58-percent full and rising. The Agua Fria River was running high last week, providing some nutrient loading. The current will likely attract stripers even though we are a couple of months a least from the spawning time. Don forget that there is a bald eagle nesting closure on the Agua Fria and the access road off Table Mesa Road is closed. Try working the open section of the Agua Fria and target the submerged river channel that is where you will likely locate the huge schools of stripers and whites. For all those who enjoy seeing lots of shorebirds, such as snowy egrets, try in the Humbug Creek area. This area can also be a striper haven and might even hold for nice crappies as well.   Angler reports:   Where: Pleasant, Agua Fria When: 12/06/08 Caught: 28 striper, 1 white bass Technique: Anchovie chunks 20' - 30' chum with heads and tails frequently Comments:Good fish all 2 - 4 lbs around the ""no ski"" markers from 7am - 11am, bite shuts down around 1030 Name: J. Morrison   Where: Pleasant, north ramp When: 12/11/08 Caught: 9 striper Technique: Anchovie chunks 20'-30' Comments: Fished outside of ""no wake"" markers directly in line with 4 lane ramp at 4PM - 7PM, all fish 1-2 lbs and caught before dark Name: J. Morrison   Where: Lake Pleasant  When: 12/14/08 Caught: None Technique: Every possible bait you could think of  Comments:ut this guy I was fishing next to had caught the biggest bluegill I have ever seen and I mean big, it had to measure, no joke 16 to 18 inches, and I told him he should take it up to the shop and have it measured, cause it could have well been a new world record, I still shocked over this fish I've caught them before back in the mid west 11 to 12 inches and those where red ears but this was a true blue gill, he said he was going to eat it, and told him that I would give him $20 bucks for it, so I could put it up next to my other bass I have, he said no way they are too good to eat, and I agreed.  Name: Micheal Culbertson   Where: Pleasant, Agua Fria When: 12/13/08 Caught: 16 striper, 1 white bass Technique: anchovie chunks 30'to 40' Comments: Cut bait, chum every 5 -10 mins with heads and tails and place chunks on hooks, fish are 2 - 4 pounds Name: J.  Morrison   Where: Lake Pleasant When: 12/15/08 Caught: Largemouth Bass Technique: Topwater (Zara Puppy)and Texas rigged Robo worms (Oxblood) Comments: Fished from daylight until the rains started about 1:00pm. Good bite about 9:30 to 12:00. Watched for boils and threw topwater. Fish on Texas rig were all off of points and next to structure. Name: Martin Dewett   Where: Pleasant - Northern Coves When: 12/13/08 Caught: 8 LMB, 4 Whites Technique: Jerkbaits, Sexy Shad DD22's, and Shallow 'white' cranks. White blades and of course the fairy wand was used for 3 fish... Comments: When I say shallow cranks, I mean 5-7 feet down. Later in the day/evening pull out those DD22's and Blades; slow roll and hang on! Biggest bass was just under 7lbs and the smallest was 1.13lbs the whites were all very small. The main lake is dead right now... Don't waste your time, head north! Give it another week and you'll need to fish deep again in the main lake.  Name: Chuck E. Cheese   ROOSEVELT LAKE - Lake Elevation is 2143 ft (90-percent full). Tonto Creek runoff was at 213 cfs on Jan. 2 while inflow from the Salt River was at 807 cfs. Both the Salt River and Tonto Creek ramped up to spring-like slows last week. These type of flows in winter are slow down the largemouth bass and crappie bite, but can sometimes get the smallmouth bass bite going. However, once things settle down, expect to start finding winter crappie either in open water (large schools that look like upside-down Christmas trees on the graph), or hovering over deep submerged trees and brush. Crappie anglers may have to adjust to the new terrific conditions with lots of submerged brush and trees crappie love wood. Expect lots of floating debris in both ends of the lake. Increased turbidity this time of year could significantly slow down the bite, but will pay dividends in fish productivity later. With any luck, we will have a decent January crappie bite, although additional storms could alter that possibility.   Angler reports:   Where: Roosevelt Lake When: 12/07/08 Caught: Largemouth & one small mouth Technique: Rubber worms, texas rig, 11 to 25 feet of water. Comments: Most of the fish were slotters or under, one over. Name: Ben Moss    APACHE - Lake elevation is 1907 ft (93-percent full). Over 4,000 smallmouth bass stocked in Apache Lake two weeks ago.  The smallies were in great condition.  Mostly in the 5-7 inch range and there were a few 9-10 inch bass mixed in with a bunch of 4 inch ones.  Thanks to the United Arizona Angler Foundation, which helped purchase and stock these fish.  Game and Fish tagged the fish so as to discern them from other smallmouth bass previously stocked. An experienced angler caught a 1.5 lb largemouth on a jerk bait in 10 minutes of fishing while waiting for the stocking truck to arrive. Don forget that, effective in 2009, there will be a slot limit for Apache Lake bass.   CANYON LAKE Lake elevation is 1,657 ft, which is 94-percent full. When it rains, the steep sides of Canyon Lake often become a paradise of waterfalls. Fly fishermen are doing well at Boulder Recreation area using semi seal leeches and give wooly buggers a try.  This tidbit from AZ Fly Fishing. An angler fished from first light to about 12:30 and used 6 inch swimbaits and had pretty good luck catching bass, one was a 3 pounder.  A white 4 inch grub hooked to a 1/16 oz darter jig head worked well for some smaller bass. Another angler fished about the same timeframe and caught 8 largemouth bass, 3 yellow bass and a smallmouth bass.  All were below 14 inches.  He stated deep reaction baits worked well for him. Don forget that, effective in 2009, there will be a slot limit for Canyon Lake bass.   SAGUARO LAKE Lake elevation 1524 feet at 91-percent full. A couple anglers had a fantastic day (34 fish in 3 hours) on the lake despite some rain.  If shad are boiling, top water lures are the ticket.  Once the boils disappear try throwing jerkbait towards shore.  Good fishing grounds include the divider reef area, the snags and around Butcher Jones. Another couple anglers caught 16 largemouth bass 3 hours using a variety of techniques including dropshot, jerkbait, Carolina rigs and flipping worms. For you fly fishermen, Butcher Jones is fishing well for trout with Prince nymphs about 35 yards out. Wooly buggers are also worth trying. This info from our friends at AZ Fly Fishing. Don forget that for 2009 and beyond, there will be a slot limit for Saguaro Lake bass.   Angler reports:   Where: Saguaro When: 12/19/08 Caught: 6 largemouth bass, 7 bluegill, 1 rainbow trout Technique: Kalin's 2 inch grubs on lead heads and Powerbait microtubes, using ultralight gear. Comments: Fished at Butcher Jones vertical jigging on the dock and at the 2nd launch ramp. Slow fishing but still excellent.  Name: W.C. Davidson   BARTLETT LAKE Lake elevation is 1,757 ft, which is 49-percent full. Flows popped up last week down the Verde - keep a watch out for possible floating debris. Reservoir release was 112 cfs on Jan. 2. Fish are being caught along the walls using a variety of jigs; pumpkin green and watermelon are enticing the bite for some. Anglers are boating a few fish with cranks and drop shot technique but fishing was slow according to a few fishermen last weekend.  Weather was a quite nippy as well. White spinner baits are reported as working well.  Another well informed angler suggests throwing white fat free fingerling shad cranks or similar lures in the shallows.  Be sure to hit the rocks at the bottom to entice the bite.  Other good choices include c-rigged or t-rigged twin tailed skirted lures or smallie beavers in the shallow rocks in less than 15 feet of water in a variety of coves.     HORSESHOE LAKE -- Lake elevation is at 1,957 feet, 5-percent full.    VERDE RIVER -- Flows at Tangle Creek were around 450 cubic feet per second on Jan. 2, higher last week. Expect to find the upper end of the lake a little turbid, with a fair amount of floating debris.   LOWER SALT RIVER (below confluence with Verde River) nbsp;SRP was releasing 186 cfs from Saguaro Lake and 112 cfs from Bartlett this week. There were more than 1,500 trout stocked last week in the Phon Du. Sutton and Granite Reef areas.   Angler reports:   Where: Lower Salt River When: 12/14/08 Caught: 1 Largemouth Technique: Used a minnow swim bait and bounced it off the bottom. Comments: Name: Joe Freye   Where: Lower Salt River upstream from Granite Reef When: 12/12/08 Caught: 7 Largemouth Bass, 1 Trout Technique: 4 Bass on swim bait. 2 Bass on a spinner bait, 1 Bass on a Panther Martin and 1 Trout on a Panther Martin Comments: Fish are biting a little in the afternoon but the best fishing is right at dusk. Name: Joe Freye   Where: Lower Salt River just upstream from Granite Reef When: 12/05/08 Caught: 7 Largemouth Bass Technique: 2 on a Panther Martin, 1 with a live night crawler and 4 on a spinnerbait. Comments: Worked the Panther Martin across the channel with medium speed. The worm was about 14-16 inches below a bobber. Used a white spinnerbait and threw it across the river to the edge of the cattails. Worked it across the channel bumping it off the bottom. Most hits were within a few seconds of the lure hitting the water. Name: Joe Freye   Where: Salt below Phon D. Sutton When: 12/04/08 Caught: Two carp and a bass Technique: Night crawler on a weightless hook. Comments: Fished Phon D. Sutton down about a mile. A little slow, but it's always exciting to not know what you are going to reel in. We thought trout was going to be the winner, but it ended up being carp. Good times... Name: Tyson   CREEKS -- With the snowfall and runoff, the waters could be murky and access will likely be tough.      * Haigler Creek Access could be tough. * Canyon Creek Access could be tough. * Tonto Creek Access could be tough. * Christopher Creek No reports. * East Verde - No reports * Workman Creek No reports.   HORSETHIEF BASIN LAKE Probably not worth driving to just for fishing, but it might be worth a visit if you are prowling the Bradshaw Mountains and want to wet a line for some small sunfish or bass.   COLORADO RIVER NORTHWEST   LAKE POWELL -- By Wayne Gustaveson, Utah Division of Wildlife: It has been a great fishing season but this is my last regular report for the year. Next week we head up lake for annual gill net sampling, so I won't be able to provide a new reports from my other office - which is Lake Powell. There will be incidental updates through the winter as news worthy events occur.    The yearly summary is very bright. Shad made a tremendous comeback in 2008. They fed the rising generation of game fish left over after the old generation passed out of the picture in shad-poor 2007. Young stripers grew rapidly, doubling in weight from 1.5 to 3 pounds from spring to fall. Some trophy stripers remain and continue to pack on pounds but the bulk of the population weighs in at 3-4 pounds and is primed to produce a bumper crop of stripers in 2009.     Striped bass hatched in 2009 will survive on plankton early in the year and may eat some shad in summer and fall if shad are abundant. The main predatory impact of the new striped bass overpopulation will not be felt until 2010. Striped bass fishing in 2009 will be great for large numbers of 4-pound fish. If shad are scarce, bait fishing will be excellent. If shad are abundant in 2009, then stripers will grow to 6-pounds before the predation induced forage crash occurs in 2010.    Bass, particularly largemouth, were treated to a forest of habitat as the lake rose 45 feet in 2008. Brush that had grown around the lake edge was flooded providing dense cover for largemouth, crappie and bluegill. Copious shad were added to the fish forest resulting in lush habitat and feeding conditions seldom seen in this lake.    Smallmouth hung out on the rocks at the edge of the habitat forest feeding on shad at a leisurely rate and loving it. These conditions were optimum for all sport fish. Bluegill, crappie, walleye, and catfish all excelled. The perfect mix of food and cover was to the liking of all participants, perhaps with one exception.    Here is what's happening. Stripers are feeding quickly during their prime feeding times. At first light and last light there is a brief flurry of feeding. Some of it is on top when five fish splash in unison. These fish are as susceptible to angling as are any stripers when they decide to eat. They grab anything close to their mouth when in feeding mode. The event lasts for about 20 minutes and then its over.    This quick boil is almost impossible to find by running around the lake looking for boils because it is of short duration and happens early when light is not adequate to illuminate a few splashes. Those that have been successful are camped near the action and waiting when the sky lightens in the morning. Once a feeding location is known, an angler could be waiting at the right spot to get 5 quick fish. Find them one day and return to the spot the next for consistent action.    During daylight, fishing is tough with only a random boil that could happen anytime, any place and then not repeat. Spooning is good if a school is found but they move quickly out of the zone. Cooler temperatures will improve spooning results as shad move deep. Do not expect that to happen until November.    Trolling is working near the inflows where shad abundance is high. At Hite and upper San Juan use a deep diver to get down 20 feet and near the lazily moving stripers.  For this week the best bet is to fish for bass around shad schools located in the backs of many brushy coves. Surface lures tossed near brush (with shad) are being whacked with regularity morning and evening. During the day plastic tubes and drop shot shad baits are working on the deep water side of brushy shad coves. Fish 25 feet for best action on keeper sized fish.   When fish are fat and fussy the strategy is to make them mad. Shad colored baits blend win well with thousands of shad. Sometime the wild colors of a fire tiger crankbait trigger a reaction when shad colors will not. Go bright and see if the fishing fortunes improve.   LEES FERRY nbsp;Fishing report courtesy Lees Ferry Anglers.   Fly Fishing: Fishing was reported as being a little slow on New Year Day. The water came up fast and stayed that way the entire day. Most of the good gravel bars were either taken or under water pretty early. So most were drifting and fishing from the boat. Folks that were wading did OK. Some better than others, I guess that would depend on where you were on the river. I am not sure but I think the flows will change after the 1st of the year. Very uncrowded.   Spin Fishing: Glo bugs bounced off the bottom. Also, black and olive jigs were effective today. Stop by and check out the rig for bottom bouncing and we will fill you in on whatever else is happening and fun while you are out there.   Fishing Synopsis and Forecast by Terry Gunn 11/12/08 Recent Fishing Conditions: At a time when just about everything you read is bearing bad news, it gives me great pleasure to bring you some good news: The fishing at Lees Ferry is not just good, it great!   The fish are in the best shape and size that I have seen in several years and everything points to this being a trend that I expect to continue. Fishing is just going to get better and better as 2009 arrives  Isn it great to hear some good news for a change! Not only is the fishing upriver great but rumor has it that the Walk-in area is fishing extremely well. One other thing; there has been no one hereome up (you can probably book a guide for tomorrow) and see the best fishing in years and you will likely have the river to yourself. Read on for the full story.       LAKE MEAD Lake Mead water levels continue to creep up to around 1,110 feet above msl.  Fishing remains on the slow side from Temple Bar up through Greggs Basin.  An occasional striper is being caught down below 40-feet on anchovies. Launching conditions at South Cove have remained nearly the same for the last three months.  The new concrete ramp the National Park Service just completed is two lanes with cones marking the edges. Use caution not to go off the sides of the metal extensions at either side. National Park Service is working to keep the ramp open.     Important notice: With the recent discovery of invasive quagga mussels in Mead, Mohave and Havasu, proper cleaning of all watercraft is critical to help prevent the spread of these invaders.  Please drain and dry your livewell and bilge on land. Drain all the water you can from your engine. Also, inspect your vessel and trailer, removing any visible mussels, but also feel for any rough or gritty spots on the hull. These may be young mussels that can be hard to see. For more information, go to the Arizona Game and Fish Department's web pages at azgfd.gov or visit  http://100thmeridian.org/ .   LAKE MOHAVE nbsp; The lake level continues to rise here too.  639 feet above msl is the current elevation.  Fishing has been slow here as well as at Mead but the stripers that do get caught are fat and happy.   Lots of bass and bluegill located on fish habitat in 10-15 ft.  As the aquatic vegetation has died off, the fish have consolidated around submerged trees and brush.  I have been getting some reports of 5-15 lb stripers being caught in the area of Katherine landing. Biologists from both Arizona Game and Fish Department and Nevada Division of Wildlife have continued to install fish habitat in both Carp Cove and Box Cove.  The largemouth, bluegill and catfish are really utilizing the new structures.  Additional habitat will be added at several locations over the next two years.  These structures are fish magnets. There is a wheelchair accessible fishing pier just south of the main launch ramp at Katherine's Landing. If you fish Mohave and are having luck, please e-mail me at  mchmiel@azgfd.gov  so I can share your successes with others.

WILLOW BEACH - Trout are stocked every Friday.  Fishing has been pretty good for trout.    Most of the success has been coming from or around the new pier. Try using green Power Worms, or salmon eggs.  The striper fishing has been fair.     Important notice: With the recent discovery of invasive quagga mussels in Mead, Mohave and Havasu, proper cleaning of all watercraft is critical to help prevent the spread of these invaders. Please drain and dry your livewell and bilge on land.

TOPOCK MARSH Water level is going down for the winter, so be careful while launching.  The fishing for crappie has picked up a little, but is still on the slow side.  Golden shores and Game and Fish held a kids fishing clinic at five mile landing on Saturday  October  11th.  This is the second year this event has been held.  The kids had fun.  Some catfish and bass were caught. Game and Fish biologists surveyed the Marsh starting on the week of Jan. 15.  The largemouth bass population was observed to be very healthy, as well as channel catfish.  Crappie were also present, but in smaller numbers. You can access the marsh by boat at North Dike, Catfish Paradise, and Five-Mile Landing. All three also provide plenty of area for shoreline fishing too. For more information on the marsh, contact the Havasu National Wildlife Refuge at (760) 326-3853 or go to  http://www.fws.gov/southwest/refuges/arizona/havasu/index.html .

COLORADO RIVER BELOW DAVIS DAM he striper bite has been slow.    Trout were last stocked on December 17th and 18th.  Trout are stocked once a month at both Davis camp and the Riverside.  Look for the trout fishing to be good immediately following the stocking. Water levels on the river fluctuate, so be careful. You can check the Bureau of Reclamation Web site for flow predictions  http://www.usbr.gov/lc/riverops.html  before you go.

SOUTHWESTERN ARIZONA   ALAMO LAKE Both the Santa Maria River and Burro Creek were flowing this week thanks to runoff, which should give Alamo a little elevation boost and some nice nutrients. However, a rising lake in winter can turn off the fishing a little. Fishing had been generally fair with some bass and crappies being caught, along with some nice channel catfish. We still have hopes for some decent winter crappie fishing in January and February, but cold wet storms blasting through the state can keep the crappie unsettled, although it will be great for future fishing.   Angler reports:   Where: Alamo Lake When: 11/15/08 Caught: 6 bass 37 catfish 4 carp Technique: Old Faithful (Worms)  Comments: My wife and I got to the lake at 7:30am fished all day till 4:30pm. It was windy and the water was pretty choppy. Anchored in the upper end pass the second buoy line near the limbs sticking out the water. We caught two nice 3 pound bass and two 4 to 6 pound catfish. The carp was 4 to 6 pound also. We had the best time ever. Name: Kenny Walker   LAKE HAVASU/TOPOCK GORGE Fishing the channel near London Bridge is great during Christmas you almost expect old St. Nick to pass over the old London-like shops and such at any time. You might even catch a nice striper or smallmouth.   Lake Havasu Fishing Report courtesy John Galbraith at Anglers Pro Shop. Lake level 447.17. Water temp. 61-66 degrees. Fair to good reports of striper action in the early am hours (7 to 10 a.m.) from Cattail Cove north to Black Meadow Landing using 2 or 3 oounce Strata spoons in water over 35 feet deep. All-white Clatter shads or Pointer 128s working well north of Standard Wash to Whipple  Bay.  Fishing live shad is excellent now throughout the day or nighttime hours.  Shad must be caught using a snag hook, such as a #2 treble with a small amount of lead around the shank, or a 4' max. size shad net. Best time to get shad is during dark hours of the early morning or evening when shad move shallow near lighted docks or ramps.  Adding extra weights to your throw net will increase your chances of catching shad in deeper water or during daylight hours.   Largemouth bass is fair with best catches coming during breezy or windy days using trophy minnow jerk baits in chart shad, LV500 Rat-L-Traps or spinnerbaits thrown over bays with sparse weed beds in 5 to 12 feet of water.   The following report is courtesy Georgia at Capt. Doyle Guide Service in Topock: Crappie action at South Dyke in the Topock Marsh is bustling. Minnows and night crawlers are the baits of choice. North Dyke is running a close second. Also being taken at North Dyke on dead minnows are catfish. Night crawlers are doing the trick on the largemouth bass at Catfish Paradise. No sizes or numbers have been reported.  Water temperature in the Topock Gorge is 54and dropping. Like elsewhere on the river, the stripers are either biting or their not. In either case, the numbers of nibbles or netted are down due to the cooler conditions. Although the bite is slowing down, channel catfish continue to be caught on everything from stink to cut bait.    Angler reports:   Where: Lake Havasu When: 11/28/08 Caught: 25 large and smallmouth bass Technique: Live shad Comments: All bass were between 3 and 7 lbs. Name: Jerry Martin   OUTLOOK FOR SOUTHWESTERN WATERS (Fall-Winter Outlook 2008-09):   Alamo Lake:    The lake elevation continues to be good, at 1,115-1,118 feet, and both the main and Cholla ramps will be usable.  Largemouth bass are present in all sizes and fishing is expected to be good to excellent throughout the fall.  Recent fisheries surveys showed a significant number of bass growing out of the slot, and there are many smaller fish below the slot.  Apparently we have had very good spawns the past two years, as there are plenty of young bass in the population.  Crappies are also doing well and fishing should be good throughout the fall.   There are an impressive number of channel catfish in Alamo Lake, especially in the upper portion of the lake.  Many of these are on the small side, but there are significant numbers in the 2 to 3-pound size range, as well as occasional individuals of 7 to 8 pounds, and larger. There are other fish present such as bluegill, redear sunfish, tilapia and carp that are a lot of fun to catch.   During the fall surveys we noted an abundance of decent-sized redear sunfish, up to a pound.  This species commonly reaches sizes of over two pounds, although we have not yet observed redear sunfish of this size in Alamo Lake.   All types of bait, plastics, spinner baits and top-water lures should work.  As the weather cools off, try slowly working plastics in deeper water for bass.  For channel catfish any of the prepared catfish baits will work, as well as chicken livers or your own secret concoctions. Bass anglers even catch channels on crankbaits here.    Although the store at Alamo Lake is still closed at this point, the Alamo Lake State Park is planning on having it open by the first of the calendar year.  The store will be operated by the Park.  Gas, bait, ice and limited supplies and tackle will be available. You should plan on bringing with you any supplies you will need, in case the store does not open as planned, or does not carry what you need.  If you run short of anything, you might be able to pick it up at the Wayside Inn in Wayside, or in Wenden. The certified scale is presently located at the Alamo Lake State Park office, but will likely be moved to the store (which is located in the same location as the old store), once that facility is open. Currently the Alamo State Park Office and the park office sell live bait for crappie fishermen.   Lake Havasu & Topock Gorge:    Fishing for largemouth bass, as well as smallmouth bass, is expected to be good to excellent. Sizes will range from 13 inches and up, with an occasional fish greater than 4 pounds. Striped bass will continue to be excellent for small fish (12-18 inches) with occasional fish over 8 pounds. Channel catfish as well as bluegill and redear sunfish will be fair to good. Flathead catfish fishing should be fair at the lower end of the lake (Bill Williams River Arm) throughout the fall. Flathead catfish can reach 40 pounds or better in the lower portion of the lake. When fishing for them select the interior points in the coves and the areas where artificial structure has been placed. The cooler weather causes the bite to slow down, so it is important to work your lures more slowly, and in deeper water.  Put away your topwater lures and switch to plastics, crank baits, spinner baits, jigs, etc.      Colorado River (Parker Strip Area):    Smallmouth bass with fish over two pounds in size are expected to be fair this fall.  In addition, redear sunfish should also be fair in the pound-plus sizes. The Parker Strip is well known for its smallmouth bass fishing, especially in the area from the dam to several miles downstream. The Parker Strip is also home to some really impressive, dinner-plate sized redear sunfish of two pounds or larger. Channel and flathead catfish fishing is always fair in this section of the Colorado River.  Below the dam, striper fishing should also be fair, using live shad or anchovies this fall.   Colorado River (between Palo Verde Diversion Dam and Walter's Camp):    This area should be fair for both smallmouth bass (in the channel) and largemouth bass (in the backwaters) throughout the entire area. Channel and flathead catfish are always fair to good in this section of the Colorado River. Most of the flathead catfish will be in the 2 to 5 pound size range with an occasional fish over 30 pounds. The time for fishing for both species of catfish is in the evening to midnight.      Colorado River (between Walter's Camp and Picacho State Park):    This section of the Colorado River is relatively remote and can only be accessed by boat from either end. Fishing is expected to be fair to good for flathead catfish with sizes over 40 pounds. The best time for fishing for both species of catfish will be in the evening to midnight.  Largemouth bass and bluegill are also present in the various backwaters and slack water areas. Other species available in the main river are smallmouth bass, and striped bass.    Colorado River (between Picacho State Park and Imperial Dam):    This area is expected to be fair to good for largemouth bass, channel catfish, and flathead catfish. Bass and channel catfish in excess of 5 pounds are present along with flathead catfish as large as 40 pounds, or larger.  Bluegills are also present in the various backwaters and an occasional striped bass will be caught in the main river channel.    Colorado River (between Laguna and Morelos dams):    This area will be fair for largemouth bass and flathead catfish. Bass in excess of 5 pounds are common and flathead catfish over 20 pounds are a good bet. In this area accessibility to the river is dependent on the amount of water being released. Usually shallow draft boats work the best. The lower end has had some dredging work done and larger boats may be able to get on the river in that area. With the increase in border issues and illegal activity on the lower end of this stretch, we recommend exercising extreme caution, avoiding nighttime use, or even staying away from the area altogether (Pilot Knob to Moreles Dam).    Regional Hot Spots:   Alamo Lake will be the hot spot for largemouth bass and channel catfish.  There are many fish in the lake at the present time (especially channel catfish), and keeping some to eat will not impact the population in the slightest, and will perhaps even enhance it.  Next choice would be Lake Havasu for striped bass, Lake Havasu and the Parker Strip for smallmouth bass, and Martinez Lake and Imperial Division backwaters for largemouth bass.   For the die-hard flathead catfish angler, large catfish can still be caught from Walter Camp down to Imperial Dam, although fishing likely won be as effective as in the warmer months. If you need any additional information or assistance, don't hesitate to contact the Yuma Regional office at (928) 341-4052 and we will be happy to give you whatever information we have.

BEACHES & PARKS : Huntington Beach,        California is a year round tropical paradise that offers   8.5 miles   of soft,        sandy beaches and approximately   70     parks  where sports activities and play await. Events at the     various parks are held either through sponsors or through the City of     Huntington Beach. Three beaches within the boundaries of        Huntington Beach are from north to south: Bolsa Chica State Beach,     Huntington City Beach and Huntington State Beach. These beaches include     lifeguards on duty during regular operating hours, though guard service     is less extensive from October through March. The waters off this     portion of the California Coast provide some of the best waves, due to     the west facing beach layout. The beach located at the Huntington     Beach Pier,     Huntington City Beach, operates separately from the two beaches north     and south of it, Bolsa Chica State Beach and Huntington State Beach. City Beach parking fees are determined by the City of     Huntington Beach. Fees at the other beaches are     determined by California State Parks and are a different price     than City Beach fees.      Bolsa        Chica State Beach  begins at Sunset Beach on the north end of the        coast.  Parking is for cars and RV camping is available. There are        fire rings, restrooms and surfing is popular here.    Dog Beach   stretches from Seapoint to Golden West Streets        along the coast. Dogs are only allowed on this beach.  Parking        is available in two unattended lots south of the beach,  with meters        charging a minimum of 25 cents.   Huntington City Beach  stretches from Dog Beach on the north end        near Seapoint Street to Huntington State Beach near Beach Boulevard on the        south end. Concessions, restaurants on the Huntington Beach Pier,        and the famous paved bike path extend through here. Parking ranges from        metered to day fee.  Huntington        State Beach   extends south from Beach Boulevard parking lot to     the Newport Beach border. Parking fee is approx $10.    Beach Hours : State Beaches are open from 6 AM to 10 PM (seasonal). Gates are        open from 6 AM to 9 PM. Huntington City Beach is open from 5 AM to 10 PM.

To obtain a permit, you must contact the official City of Huntington     Beach and State of California agents that operate the beach facilities.         Bicycling     is a favorite activity in Huntington Beach. The 8.5     mile paved bike path that is adjacent to the Pacific Ocean features     ocean views, soft breezes and some sand that drifts onto the path.     Caution is advised. Also be sure to watch for pedestrians, surfers and     roller bladers that share the path. In busy summer months from May to     September, speed limits are posted for safety. Bicycle rentals are     available at beach concessions throughout the three beaches located in     Huntington Beach.     Boats     can be launched from a boat ramp near Warner Avenue        and Pacific Coast Highway. Another ramp at Sunset Aquatic Park is located at the        end of Edinger Avenue.      Commercial filming  is licensed through the City of Huntington Beach        and through State Beach contacts. Filming that has occurred in Huntington     Beach includes episodes of popular shows such as Elimidate, Blind Date     and other productions. Bay Watch and Nash Bridges, syndicated TV shows     now out of production, both filmed episodes in Huntington Beach     locations. The Huntington Beach mayor appeared on Sharon Osbourne show     and accepted the key to Orange County in honor of the popular TV show,  The OC .          Dogs  are only allowed on Dog Beach, between Seapoint and        Golden West Streets. Dog Park is located in Central Park near Central Park     Drive off Edwards. Dogs are not permitted on the Huntington Beach Pier.          Fire rings  are available on most beaches, first come basis, but you must bring your own wood and keep fires in the ring.           Fishing from beaches requires a California Fishing License        (except for the Grunion Run and two free fishing days per year.) Fishing from public piers is Free.      Kayak  rentals are not available at the beach area but are     available at the bordering unincorporated community of Sunset Beach to     the north. You will find rentals adjacent to Pacific Coast Highway near     Warner Avenue.          Kites  can be flown from Huntington Beach. The air currents     usually provide ideal flying conditions. Functional and decorative kites     and flags are sold at a shop on the Huntington Beach Pier.          Naturists and nudity  policies require clothing be worn on beaches.         Roller Blading  is popular along the 8.5 cement path that     runs along the entire 8.5 miles of beachfront in Huntington Beach. Bring     your own skates or rent some from beach concessions such as Zack's (see     link below).    RV camping is available at Bolsa Chica State Beach, and a        private RV facility across the street from Huntington State Beach called     Huntington By The Sea RV Resort.

During the summer months it becomes a parking lot for high     season beach traffic.          Tent camping  is not allowed on any beaches. The nearest tent     camping is available in Crystal Cove State Park in Newport Beach,     approximately 12 miles south of Huntington Beach.    Huntington Beach Pier  is the longest municipal pier of its type in California. We used to think it was the longest municipal pier, but it isn't.     It is constructed of reinforced concrete and offers free fishing, a     Ruby's diner with ocean views, Surf City Store with souvenir gifts and     logo items, Kite Connection, Let's Go Fishin' fish     and bait store and free     public restrooms.

The pier has cement benches to sit and watch the waves, is wheelchair     accessible and has pay scopes for viewing the surrounding region. The     pier is most popular for watching surfing and taking souvenir photos of     friends, family and the ocean. The pier celebrated 100 years in 2004. Not allowed on the pier are pets, skating, bicycling or skateboarding.  You are not allowed to jump from the pier.

clueweb09-enwp00-06-11324	"                     African Plate          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  African plate )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search                        The African plate, shown in pinkish-orange       The  African Plate  is a  tectonic plate  which includes the  continent  of  Africa , as well as oceanic crust which lies between the continent and various surrounding ocean ridges.   The westerly side is a  divergent boundary  with the  North American Plate  to the north and the  South American Plate  to the south forming the central and southern part of the  Mid-Atlantic Ridge . The African plate is bounded on the northeast by the  Arabian Plate , the southeast by the  Indo-Australian Plate , the north by the  Eurasian Plate  and the  Anatolian Plate , and on the south by the  Antarctic Plate . All of these are divergent or spreading boundaries with the exception of the northern boundary with the Eurasian Plate (except for a short segment near the  Azores , the  Terceira Rift ).   The African Plate comprises several continental blocks or  cratons , stable continental blocks of old rocks, which came together to form the African continent during the assembly of the  supercontinent   Gondwana  around 550 million years ago. These cratons are, from south to north, the  Kalahari ,  Congo ,  Sahara  and  West African craton . Each of these cratons can further be subdivided into even smaller blocks or  terranes , sutured along pre-Gondwanan  orogenic  belts.          Map of East Africa showing some of the historically active volcanoes(red triangles) and the Afar Triangle (shaded, center) -- a  triple junction  where three plates are pulling away from one another: the Arabian Plate, and the two parts of the African Plate (the Nubian and the Somalian) splitting along the East African Rift Zone (USGS).       The African Plate is  rifting  in the eastern interior along the  East African Rift . This rift zone separates the Nubian subplate to the west from the Somalian subplate to the east. One hypothesis proposes the existence of a  mantle plume  beneath the Afar region, while an opposing hypothesis asserts that the rifting is merely a zone of maximum weakness where the African Plate is deforming as plates to its east are moving rapidly northward.   The African Plate's speed is estimated at around 2.15 centimeters per year. It has been moving over the past 100 million years or so in a general northeast direction. This is drawing it closer to the Eurasian Plate, causing subduction where oceanic crust is converging with continental crust (e.g. portions of the central and eastern Mediterranean). In the western Mediterranean, the relative motions of the Eurasian and African plates produce a combination of lateral and compressive forces, concentrated in a zone known as the  Azores-Gibraltar Fault Zone . Along its northeast margin, the African Plate is bounded by the  Red Sea Rift  where the  Arabian Plate  is moving away from the African Plate.   The  New England hotspot  in the  Atlantic Ocean  has probably created a short line of mid to late- Tertiary  age  seamounts  on the African Plate but appears to be currently inactive.

Barbados is a friendly-- though much-developed-- Caribbean island, with fun family outings and direct flights from the UK     Barbados: Features    Barbados is the most easternly Caribbean island   known for high-end celeb-type resorts   a British colony until 1966; legacies include cricket, high tea, and driving on the left.   the island is only 168 sq. miles yet home to 265,000 people. Many areas are very developed    Local Lingo  : English is widely spoken, and visitors will enjoy the easy-to-understand  Bajan dialect  (pronounced  Bay-jan .)    Barbados Vacations for families    Barbados is a top Caribbean destination for UK visitors. Dubbed the ""Little England of the Caribbean"", Barbados is perceived as ""the most British"" of the Caribbean islands. And --as the furthest-east Caribbean island-Barbados is easily reached by daily flights from London and other UK cities.      Visitors from any country will find a friendly, safe atmosphere. Smiles and waves from strangers go a long way to make a tourist feel welcome. And, while travelers should always be careful of pickpockets when out'n'about, tourists in Barbados can feel comfortable renting a car and touring on their own. (Provided, of course, you can drive on the left.)   As for resorts: even the even legendary luxury  Sandy Lane  resort welcomes kids. All-inclusive choices include the  Almond Beach Village Resort (with an entire family area)  Almond Casuarina Beach Resort . More resorts await on ""cheap and cheerful"" busy South coast, which also has ondo rentals.   What's fun for families to do in Barbados:      explore the underseas on an  Atlantis Adventures  submarine trip    many resorts on the west Gold Coast have coral off-shore, providing an easy way for kids to try snorkeling    visit  Harrison's Cave    Take a day-long boat outing and snorkel over coral and with sea-turtles     take a  jeep ""safari""  around the island   take a  Jolly Roger pirate ship  cruise   visit the  Barbados Wildlife Reserve  (primarily a monkey sanctuary)    attend the   Bajan Roots and Rhythm  dinner plus stage  show, with dancers, steel pan bands, folklore figures, fire-eaters, stilt-walkers, fire-limbo.... Prices are steep but include buffet dinner; kids welcome.    Five-week festival in Barbados    The  Crop Over Festival  starts with a parade in mid-July and lasts for weeks. Revived in the 1970's, the origins of Crop Over go back centuries, to celebrations when the hard work of harvesting the sugar cane was done. The Crop Over King and Queen are those who've harvested the most sugar cane. Kadooment Day is a grand finale, with costumed parade.     Keep in mind about Barbados:       Prices tend to be high; North Americans seeking a mid-range resort may feel they're paying more for less.   The northeast, with its rough seas, still has undeveloped stretches of beach.  No swimming, but in some areas you can go ""sea-bathing"", i.e. dip in the sea close to shore.   though the Barbados dollar is pegged to the US dollar at a fixed rate, Canadian exchange rate floats.   flight time from New York is approx. 4-1/2 hours.

GOLDEN ALGA STRIKES CORTEZ LAKE   On Friday December 28, 2007, Department biologists received reports of dying fish at Cortez Lake in north Phoenix.Laboratory tests confirmed that golden alga was present in the water.That same day the lake was treated with an algaecide which stopped this pesky invader from killing any more fish.Although several hundred shad were lost, there were no signs that the larger sportfish had been affected.The lake was stocked with half of the allotted trout and is expected to be stocked with the full amount during the incentive stocking week.For more information on golden alga go to  www.azgfd.gov  and search for golden alga.To report any suspicious observations of fish behavior or lake conditions immediately notify local park staff and then contact the Department at 623-236-7268.   URBAN FISHING REPORT   Fishing for trout is good to excellent at most Urban Fishing Program waters.The annual incentive stocking of bonus sized fish during the week of January 7-12 means excellent fishing conditions and an opportunity for a trophy sized trout to be caught.Anglers using scented dough baits (such as Power Bait), worms fished under a bobber, or small trout lures have been successful.Try fishing with minnows along the bottom for larger trout and the occasional bass or catfish.Best times to fish for trout generally are early morning, but some anglers have reported excellent fishing late afternoon.Small spinners such as Rooster Tails and Panther Martins, or spoons such as Kastmasters are also working well for trout.Trout fishing is good to excellent at Green Valley lakes in Payson with Power Bait, worms fished under a bobber, and small spinners working best.

I would rather just enjoy some nice scenery and SHADE as I’m very light skinned but I’d enjoy eating some fish (just us 2) assuming he catches some.  If weather is nice (I hope) I’ll take a little parrot with us- maybe to Encanto or Papago.  Closest place to buy him a license from 85050? I think may be a Walmart not too far from here?

It has yielded the last five state records, and numerous ""Big Fish-of-the-Year Program"" walleye catches. Local resident Gregg Munck caught the existing state record walleye here in November 2002. It weighed in at a whopping 16 lb (7.3 kg)., 2 ozs. Anglers can also catch trout, catfish, bass and pan fish here.

Show Low Lake Park is located five miles (8 km) south of  Show Low  off  State Route 260 . The lake is noted for excellent fishing. [ who? ]     [ edit ]   Description   Show Low Lake has 100 acres (0.40 km 2 ) with an average depth of 33 feet (10 m) and maximum depth of 50 feet (15 m). It's situated at an elevation of 6,500 feet (2,000 m). The lake maintains good water quality year round, and is stocked with  rainbow trout  from April through September. The  Arizona Game and Fish Department  occasionally stocks  channel catfish . The lake also contains reproducing populations of  walleye ,  largemouth  and  smallmouth bass ,  bluegill  and  green sunfish .

There's a year-round concession with a campground that has 75 sites, seven of which have electrical hookups. There are two group sites that can accommodate up to 75 and 150 people, respectively. There is drinking water, a dump station ($3 fee), playground and shower building ($3 per shower).

[ edit ]   Fish Species     Rainbow   Largemouth Bass   Smallmouth Bass   Sunfish   Catfish (Channel)       [ edit ]   Fishing Techniques   Trout fishing from the shore is always possible because the lake doesn't get weedy. Many trout survive the winter here and can get quite large. Try trolling spinners in early spring to catch one of these fat trout. For stocked trout, try Power Bait or  night crawlers .  Walleye  fishing is best in spring and fall. Try fishing rocky bottom structures or by the dam with crank baits or jigs. Stay in the shallows and fish at dawn or dusk to improve catching odds. For the lunkers, try large crank baits in the shallows or along the shoreline, or bounce a night crawler rig slowly on the bottom. Catfishing can be exciting here. A 32-pound  channel catfish  was recently caught that threatened the State Record. Fish for catfish on summer or fall nights, using chicken liver,  night crawlers  or  waterdogs  as bait. In spring, channel catfish and walleye congregate at the upper end, where Show Low Creek flows into the lake. Small bass and sunfish can be caught with night crawlers in the rocks along the dam. Show Low Lake is open year round.     [ edit ]   Special Notes   Statewide fishing regulations apply and a trout stamp is required for anglers fishing for trout. The daily bag limit is six trout, six bass (any species), six walleye and 25 catfish for licensed anglers. Trout bag limits are halved for unlicensed anglers under 14. There is no bag limit on bluegill or green sunfish. Boat motors are restricted to electric or 10HP or less gas motors.

The theme of this years fishing regulations also dovetail well with the seasonal spirit of the holidays: Kids dont remember their best day of watching television.   Whether it is from a childs Christmas wish or your own New Years vow, take your children fishing this coming year. I guarantee the memories you make will outlast the video game he or she wants, said Fisheries Chief Kirk Young.   Dont forget that the 2009 fishing licenses are also available  a license is the ultimate gift that keeps on giving all year long. There are even family licenses and youth combination licenses available. Just check them out in the easy-to-use regulation booklet.   Thanks to Arizonas abundant snowpack and superb runoff that filled our lakes to overflowing last year, the fishing prognosis going into 2009 is very good. The recent winter storms also provide the hopeful promise of good things headed our way this coming year, Young said.   Keep in mind that there are some regulation changes also heading your way for 2009-10.   The Game and Fish Department has instituted a protective slot limit at Saguaro, Canyon and Apache lakes, where you may have six bass in possession (combination largemouth and smallmouth), of which no more than one  may be between 13 and 16 inches. The slot limit at Roosevelt is also the same as the ones at the other Salt River lakes  one bass between 13 and 16 inches may be possessed.   The Game and Fish Commission also took off the bag limits for bass (all species) and catfish (all species) at Mogollon Rim area trout waters, specifically Willow Springs, Woods Canyon Lake, Black Canyon Lake, Bear Canyon Lake, Chevelon Lake, CC Cragin Reservoir (Blue Ridge), Knoll Lake and Long Tom Lake.   This coming year also you can experience something new in the state  the first-ever seasonal, blue ribbon roundtail chub fishery. A 4.5-mile segment of Fossil Creek in the Verde Valley will be a catch-and-release-only, artificial fly and lure only, single barbless hook fishery with a seven-month season commencing Oct. 3, 2009.   We are excited about this unique fishery for one of our impressive native fish, the roundtail chub, which has historically been referred to as ‘Verde trout’ by many anglers, Young said. Keep an eye out for information on activities planned for opening day at Fossil Creek in October.                                 Posted on 22nd December 2008      Under:  Fishing ,   General  |    No Comments »                 Deadline approaching for public comments on fish stocking issues                                  From AZGFD:   Deadline approaching for public comments on fish stocking issues   Dec. 11, 2008   The Dec. 19 deadline is rapidly approaching for public comments on issues associated with all the sport-fish stockings in Arizona as part of a draft environmental assessment process being conducted by the Arizona Game and Fish Department and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.   The public input is being sought to determine the extent and variety of issues that should be addressed by the draft environmental assessment.  All comments must be submitted in writing no later than 5 p.m. on Dec. 19 .   Once the comment period ends, the wildlife agencies will prepare a draft environmental assessment to evaluate the social, economic and environmental effects of stockings related to continue funding for the program through the Sport Fish Restoration Program.   Written comments can be sent to either:   David Weedman, Aquatic Habitat Program Coordinator, Arizona Game and Fish Department, 5000 W. Carefree Highway, Phoenix, AZ 85086.  E-mail: fishaz@azgfd.gov    or   Harold Namminga, Sport Fish Restoration Grant Administrator, Wildlife and Sport Fish  Restoration Program, U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, P.O Box 1306, Albuquerque, NM 87103.   The federal funding apportioned to Arizona is authorized under the Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Act of 1950, commonly referred to as the Dingell-Johnson Act and Wallop-Breaux Act. It provides federal aid to state wildlife agencies for management and restoration of sport fish.   These Sport Fish Restoration funds are derived from a federal excise tax at the manufacturing level on certain items of sport-fishing tackle, fishing equipment and motor boat fuel.

Posted on 16th December 2008      Under:  Arizona News ,   Conservation Groups ,   Fishing ,   General  |    No Comments »                 Rory’s Tips - Fishing Info                                  Rory Aikens from AZGFD always provides great info:   “Im writing this while rain is coming down outside  this is great weather for ducks and trout. So break out the rain gear and the trout tackle.   Heres another idea  turn Black Friday into Blue Friday or maybe Rainbow Friday  dont go shopping, go fishing. Its a great way to trim off the turkey and all the trimmings. You can burn calories and catch a low-calorie meal at the same time. Then you can smile inwardly (or outwardly) every time you think about the crowded shopping malls you are not at.   Dont forget that the Mearns quail season opens Friday  and this is going to be a Mearns season they will be talking about for years, if not decades.   We stocked 3,500 trout in Tempe Town Lake (see picture above)  it was a superb fishing festival once again. Just want to thank to the good folks at Tempe Town Lake, Cabelas and Bass Pro for helping to make it such an exciting event. The kayaks proved to be a superb addition  great going Okie.   For all you anglers, that means the Town Lake is primed and ready to provide rainbow action. Saguaro and Canyon lakes have both been stocked with rainbows. They have been catching rainbows along the Lower Salt River for a couple of weeks now.   Also try Parker Canyon or Patagonia lakes in southern Arizona (Mearns quail territories).   This weather should cool down all the lakes, making them happier places for trout to abide, but the same weather will probably send the warmwater fish down deep. That means it is time to go deeper, as least most of the time.    Its tough to beat drop shots this time of year. Keep in mind that even in winter, bass will still come into the shallows at times, especially in the warmer afternoons. Try reaction baits such as spinners, buzzbaits and the like to locate these bass (they will often hit late but reveal their presence), and then be ready with a flutter down bait strategically cast to the spot where the miss occurs.    But striped bass fishing at Lake Pleasant might still be decent. Just dont expect to find many stripers in the main body of the lake  they typically congregate along submerged creek channels (fish freeways) in places like the Agua Fria Arm of Pleasant. Try slow trolling, or even back-trolling, using frozen anchovies on one rod and maybe a Rapala Countdown on another, then have another rod rigged and ready with a small KastMaster. Once you hook into one striper, keep in mind that stripers are schooling fish — chum with bits of anchovy to hold the school in place so you can catch others.   You will likely still find crappies at times as they start to congregate into larger schools in open water. The active crappies will often be 15 feet deep, even if the water depth can range from 30 to 50 feet deep. When the large crappie schools form, they will look like inverted Christmas trees on your fishing finder  which is appropriate for this time of year. Its a little early yet, but it could happen.   This is also a good time of year to target yellow bass (in the Midwest they call then stripies) using live minnows or small quarter-ounce KastMasters (gold can often work best). They might not be big in size, but they sure fight. Not bad eating either. Yellows can be found in Saguaro Lake (my recommended spot), Canyon Lake and Apache Lake.   Once this weather front passes, consider a trip to Lees Ferry (or take your rain gear and go). The trout fishing has been spectacular, the weather nice and ironically, few anglers out enjoying some of the best trout fishing in the West. Go figure.    So go out and enjoy some wet weather for a change. Isnt it great to start the winter off once again with saturated soils? If we can get some snow pack on top of those soils, you may want to have Santa bring you lots of new fishing tackle.   Maybe Ill see you out there.”   Rory A                                 Posted on 28th November 2008      Under:  Fishing ,   General  |    No Comments »                 Quik Slide Stringer System                                  Gold Canyon, AZ — August 27, 2008 -Finally, an innovative stringer system that works the way fishermen want it — fast and easy. The QuikSlide"" Stringer System is by far the best stringer system available on the market.  This stringer system is the only one featuring patented-designed “removable snaps” — an innovative feature which eliminates the need to untie or pull the stringer from the water when adding fish.        The QuikSlide Stringer System’s quality construction and double-locking, removable stainless-steel snaps make it perfect for saltwater or fresh water applications. The flexible 7-strand stainless-steel PVC-coated cable is non-abrasive, so it won’t damage boats, and the snaps’ double-swivel action eliminates tangling and keeps fish alive. Also included is a handy “snap carrier” that clips onto the fisherman’s belt or onto the stringer for ready access. So whether you’re wade fishing or boat fishing, the QuikSlide Stringer is no doubt the easiest stringer system that you’ll ever use.      The stringer comes available in 3-, 6- and 14-foot lengths. Coming soon, additional color snaps in blue, green and tan for purchase separately to help identify your fish when sharing the stringer with other anglers.

Each year, the Arizona Game and Fish Department stocks more than 3 million fish for anglers to catch in approximately 160 of Arizonas lakes, rivers and streams  mostly rainbow, Apache, brook, and cutthroat trout, but some warmwater species such as largemouth bass and channel catfish as well.    The stocking program is supported with federal funds through the Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Program, along with state funds from the sale of licenses and trout stamps.   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Arizona Game and Fish Department are seeking public comments on issues associated with all the sport-fish stockings in the state as part of a draft environmental assessment process that is required to continue using federal funding for stocking activities in Arizona.   Public input is being sought to determine the extent and variety of issues that should be addressed by the draft environmental assessment. The comment period continues through 5 p.m. on Dec. 19.   Once the comment period ends, the wildlife agencies will prepare a draft environmental assessment to evaluate the social, economic and environmental effects of stockings related to continue funding for the program through the Sport Fish Restoration Program.   As part of the scoping process, the following three public open houses are being held to answer questions and gather public input on the stocking program issues:   Pinetop, 6:30 p.m. Nov. 17, Arizona Game and Fish Department Region 1 office, 2878 E. White Mountain Blvd.  Tucson, 6:30 p.m. Nov. 24, Arizona Game and Fish Department Region 5 office, 555 N. Greasewood Road.  Phoenix, 6:30 p.m. Nov. 25, at Arizona Game and Fish Department Headquarters, 5000 W. Carefree Highway.  While we will be at the public meetings to provide background information and answer questions, all comments to be formally considered must be made in writing, said Weedman.   Written comments can be sent to either:    David Weedman , Aquatic Habitat Program Coordinator, Arizona Game and Fish Department, 5000 W. Carefree Highway, Phoenix, AZ 85086. E-mail:  fishaz@azgfd.gov.    Harold Namminga , Sport Fish Restoration Grant Administrator, Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Program, U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, P.O Box 1306, Albuquerque, NM 87103.   All comments must be submitted in writing no later than 5 p.m. on Dec. 19.   Weedman pointed out that recreational angling in Arizona totaled 4,156,000 angling days in 2006, creating a statewide economic impact of more than $1.1 billion annually.   Arizonas natural fish fauna historically consisted of 36 species of fish, only a few of which were traditionally sought by early Americans for sport fishing, which is a trend that continues today.   Since the early 1900s, the Arizona Game and Fish Department and other agencies have supplemented recreational angling opportunities by stocking state waters with sport fish species.   Fish stockings have evolved over the past 100 years or so to meet growing needs of anglers in Arizona, Weedman said. Now we consider a wide range of factors when determining where and when to stock fish, including biology, angler use, partnership commitments and needs, native fish impacts and social demands.   Although most of the trout species caught in Arizona likely come from fish hatcheries, most of the warmwater species in the state  especially those in the larger impoundments such as Roosevelt Lake  come from natural reproduction.   The federal funding apportioned to Arizona is authorized under the Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Act of 1950, commonly referred to as the Dingell-Johnson Act and Wallop-Breaux Act. It provides federal aid to state wildlife agencies for management and restoration of sport fish.   These Sport Fish Restoration funds are derived from a federal excise tax at the manufacturing level on certain items of sport-fishing tackle, fishing equipment and motor boat fuel.

The Arizona Game and Fish Commission on Oct. 11 voted to create slot limits at Saguaro, Canyon and Apache lakes just like the one already in place on Roosevelt Lake in an effort to give these popular fisheries another nudge down the comeback trail after being blitzed by golden alga blooms in recent years.   In addition, possession of one fish out the protected slot limit will be allowed at Roosevelt and this provision is also part of the new slot regulations at Saguaro, Canyon and Apache.     The Game and Fish Commission adopts the fishing regulations for a two-year period. For 2009 through 2010, the whole Salt River chain of lakes (Roosevelt, Apache, Canyon, and Saguaro) will have a 13- to 16-inch protective slot limit, with anglers being allowed to keep one slot-sized bass. These slot limits will automatically sunset after two years (the slot limit and newly added one fish possession provision at Roosevelt Lake does not sunset).   Its a nice added insurance policy for these lakes as they recover from the alga-caused fish die-offs these fisheries suffered several years ago, said Fisheries Chief Kirk Young.   Young added that anglers have always shown a willingness to play a role in helping fisheries when they can by either catching-and-releasing fish when necessary or by catching-and-keeping fish when called for.    Young explained that in December of 2007, the Game and Fish Department launched a four-pronged effort to help the popular Salt River chain lakes (below Roosevelt Lake) on the road to recovery. The ongoing efforts include:   Stocking the lakes to give sport-fish populations a boost.  Conducting fish population, water quality, and angler creel studies to determine the effectiveness of those stockings.  Implementing research to better understand golden alga and to assess whether stocking fish will benefit the fishery.    Conducting outreach and education.     This project has been another example of positive things being born out of a negative event.  Several anglers got together and organized the United Arizona Angler Foundation, a group that has successfully raised thousands of dollars to help pay for additional fish stockings. We hope to both keep this momentum and expand it to other needs at these lakes such as habitat projects and additional research, Young said.    However, he said, right now it appears that natural productivity and reproduction are the primary driving forces behind the recovery being experienced at these picturesque reservoirs along the Salt River on its journey to the Valley of the Sun.   That is okay. In fact, natural recovery is what we hope for. Our biggest management challenge is better understanding the dynamics that swing fisheries in one direction or another, especially when it comes to impacts from organisms like golden alga, Young said.   Young also pointed out that Saguaro Lake has even become an angling hot spot in the last several months. The bass and shad spawns at this lake have been phenomenal the past two years. Catch rates lately have been terrific for small bass and prolific yellow bass. That bodes well for the future, Young said.   Young cautioned that while conditions have been favorable for two years, biologists still dont know the environmental dynamics that lead to major fish-killing golden alga blooms. I am cautiously optimistic, but from all we know, it appears golden alga is here to stay. We are trying to learn more about the dynamics associated with golden alga, but we are still on the low end of the learning curve.                                 Posted on 30th October 2008      Under:  Arizona News ,   Fishing  |    No Comments »                 Commission creates first-ever blue ribbon roundtail chub fishery                                  Commission creates first-ever blue ribbon roundtail chub fishery   The Game and Fish Commission approved creating the countrys first-ever blue ribbon catch-and-release-only seasonal roundtail chub fishery along Fossil Creek in the Verde Valley starting in October of 2009.   This is really a landmark fishery for a native fish species, said Young. Plus the unique history of Fossil Creek itself makes this a classic fishing story for the ages.   When the decommissioning of the Childs Hydroelectric Power Plant and accompanying renovation of Fossil Creek was first proposed, many anglers and angling groups expressed support for the project but asked that the stream not be closed permanently to angling.   With the stream recovery progressing well, the Game and Fish Department gained the Game and Fish Commissions approval to create a catch-and-release artificial fly and lure-only (single barbless hook) fishery with a season opening the first Saturday in October and continuing through April 30   The timing of the fishing season is selected to reduce the chance of conflicts between anglers and other users during the summer months.   Lots of Arizona anglers along the Verde River over the years have learned to appreciate the angling qualities of roundtail chub, and have long referred to them as Verde trout. In fact, anglers helped to salvage roundtails from Fossil Creek during the renovation process in 2004.   Young added that not everyone has embraced the concept of having a blue ribbon roundtail chub fishery along Fossil Creek.    One concern being voiced is that some stretches of Fossil Creek have been loved a little too much. Some fear that increased usage could increase the amount of litter and other abuses. Young said. But in honesty, we expect the exact opposite.   Young explained that the dedicated anglers who will be attracted to this one-of-a-kind fishery are conscientious conservationists and stewards of the land. These are the type of outdoor enthusiasts who will give this unique travertine stream the watchful loving attention it truly deserves and should help counter some of the abuses currently being experienced there.   Young added that unless we can successfully cultivate public stewardship including a community policing component, long-term conservation of areas like Fossil Creek is likely to be tenuous. This type of fishery will also engender more public appreciation for all the states native fish populations, most of which are imperiled.                                 Posted on 27th October 2008      Under:  Arizona News ,   Fishing  |    No Comments »                 The Mighty Arapaima                                  From my friend Minjae over at the  National Geographic Channel    The Mighty Arapaima  After a day of impressive catches, an expert angler gets a bite from a beast that defies imagination.

I was delighted when a representative from Nat Geo contacted me and asked if I would like to make a post about an upcoming show called  Hooked . This is really looking like it will be a cool series of shows, airing between October 19th and 21st.   A summary:   HOOKED: FISH GONE WILD    Sunday, October 19, at 8:00 p.m. ET/PT   Using only a rod and a reel, New Zealand fishing celebrity Matt Watson snares the largest predatory fish on the planet, the great white shark.  Working with the department of conservation, he’ll hook a great white, pull it to the boat and clip a tissue sample from its fin.  The DNA will help scientists map the migrations, growth rates and genetic families of these apex predators.  Then, head to Germany to get up close with Europe’s largest freshwater fish, the wels catfish.  These aggressive bottom-feeders will devour just about anything, including animals above water!  We’ll witness one man wrestle a 7-foot-long wels catfish with his bare hands.  Next up, we’ll visit fishing mecca Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.  Here, a fishing adventurer catches record-sized marlin from his kayak.  Big game kayak fishing is extremely dangerous.  Even the most skilled sportsman can lose a limb, his boat or his life.    HOOKED: MAN VS. FISH   Sunday, October 19, at 9:00 p.m. ET/PT   Back in New Zealand, Matt Watson performs emergency surgery on a 5-foot-long, 150-pound dogtooth tuna.  Injured during Matt’s struggle to bring it to the surface, the titanic tuna’s swim bladder filled with air, preventing the team from safely releasing the fish back into the water.  In the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Key West, we’ll witness two sportsmen battle a massive lemon shark, bring it to shore to register their catch and then release the fish back into the wild.  How do they do it?  A unique onboard holding pen, specially designed to keep the shark in water while they race it to shore.  Next, we’re off to Thailand, where it takes three grown men to net a massive armor-plated arapaima.  Next, in the Gulf of Mexico, a teenager takes on a titanic tarpon.  Finally, in Brazil, follow pro fisherman Jair Rigotti as he chases a lifelong obsession hooking the “mother fish” of the Amazon, a giant piraiba.   HOOKED: GONE MONSTER FISHING    Monday, October 20, at 9:00 p.m. ET/PT    We’ll head to Kennebunkport, Maine, for a fishing expedition with the former commander-in-chief, George H.W. Bush.  Known for its massive size and armored jaws, the tarpon is certainly difficult to hook, but this former president doesn’t back down from a challenge watch his impressive battle with a bathtub-sized tarpon, using only a fly reel!  Then, take a personal tour of the 41st president’s fishing shed, packed with his favorite fishing rods and lures.     In Southern California, experience the heart-racing showdown between Marylin Stephens and a record-breaking mako shark.  See the angler’s worst fear come true when the hooked shark charges the boat and the hunter becomes the hunted!  Next, in San Carlos Bay, Florida, home video shows angler Nelson Diaz make the catch of his career, hooking a goliath grouper that measures a jaw-dropping 7 feet long, 6 feet around, and weights an estimated 500 pounds.  Finally, off the coast of Virginia, watch fishermen struggle with a stingray the size of an office cubicle and see the grueling tug-of-war between an angler and a bluefin tuna.  The mega catch stretches an astounding 9 feet long and measures more than 6 feet around it takes several men to hoist the giant tuna.     MONSTER FISH OF THE MEKONG    Tuesday, October 21, at 9:00 p.m. ET/PT     Join National Geographic Explorer Zeb Hogan on a quest to save some of the biggest freshwater fish in the world.  We’ll track the elusive and legendary freshwater stingray in northern Cambodia.  These giant stingrays grow to mammoth proportions and Zeb Hogan gets up close and personal with one of them.  Then, Hogan is off to Thailand to study the giant Mekong catfish, which can grow to be as large as a grizzly bear!  Today, the giant Mekong catfish are in danger of extinction due to overfishing and rapid development along the great rivers of Asia.  Using underwater tracking devices to locate their spawning grounds, Hogan attempts to unravel the mystery of where these titans of the deep breed.  Then, witness a rare capture of a giant Mekong catfish and watch Hogan persuade local fisherman to release the endangered creature back into the wild.

Despite the wind, Bartlett was a standout, and it looks like many did well at Roosevelt.      The great topwater bite I heard about at Pleasant slowed considerably, but I still boarded some nice, fat bass and lost one big toad (slang for a behemoth bass) that did three tail dances before spitting out the topwater lure as my boating partner tried to net it. It was a privilege to have had the hog on the line.       Surprisingly, the most productive spots at Pleasant were secondary points on the insides of coves just like you would expect for a pre-spawn bite, not a post-spawn one. Oh well. Sometimes the bass don't read the fishing books, especially when the cold wind keeps blowing the pages closed. However, as expected in windy, cold conditions, the bass were generally holding tight to brush.      Two anglers called to say they cleaned up on smallmouth during the windy days at Lake Havasu. Havasu got a nutrient bonus this year when the Bill Williams River was running heavily for a few months. Fish grow outs and spawns this year should be way above normal thanks to all that nutrient loading. When combined with all the new artificial habitat, we are expecting great things for angling at Havasu starting this year. Smallies can also be found on the river just below Parker Dam.      Despite the cold weather last weekend, we also had plenty of great reports from anglers catching larger, holdover trout in the mountain lakes. All the roads are open, although some are still muddy. One angler from Texas called to say he had one of his best trips ever (or was that evaa): he used to fish Colorado before discovering the White Mountains and Mogollon Rim country of Arizona. Grab your jacket, get out of the desert heat, and go catch some trout that will make you smile for years to come. The trout should also have that deep, rich pink flesh like salmon. They should be a great spring culinary treat. I heard from two anglers at Lee Valley Lake who caught some 15-inch native Apache trout. Lee Valley is full and spilling.      NEWS BRIEFS:      Anglers Can Help Others Online     Todd Franklin of Phoenix and his buddies had a great time, and plenty of success, fishing the creek up to a half-mile below Chevelon Lake.      Paul Totten, a Phoenix resident who is originally from England, was ecstatic after a high country fishing trip. ""My two boys and I got into a hole in Big Lake and were getting hit on every cast. What a fun way to get your limit!"" he wrote.      Ben Lucero says night crawlers were the ticket at Lynx Lake near Prescott on May 1. ""Three of us caught our limits (18 fish) in a few hours. Pan-size to 14 inches. We had a GREAT time.""      C. Straub of Tucson had lots of luck fishing Rose Canyon Lake for rainbows and browns, adding a side comment of, ""Keep stocking the browns!""      All those fishermen, and many others besides, helped other anglers by relating their experiences for the Arizona Game and Fish Department's weekly fishing report via the ""Been Fishing"" button on the report at azgfd.com. This is a year when lots of anglers will desire such timely information. Arizona is ushering in a new era of fishing thanks to near record winter rainfall amounts that resulted in a host of lakes filling, including Roosevelt Lake.      The dam at Roosevelt was raised 70 feet in 1995, which was the beginning of the prolonged drought. This year Roosevelt is making history: it is almost full. Roosevelt is expected to provide some of the best warmwater fishing in the nation the next several years as it goes through what biologists call ""the new lake syndrome.""      Bartlett, Horseshoe and Pleasant all filled in late winter and have stayed full throughout the spawns for bass, crappie and shad. Bartlett has been a consistent hot spot this year. Alamo Lake filled to near historic proportions and should be remarkable this year, and in future years. Lake Havasu is another fishery in the news: it had tremendous inflows via the Bill Williams River from Alamo Lake. Those inflows were packed with nutrients. Fish grow outs and reproduction should be some of the best ever there.      In addition, most high country lakes have filled and are currently spilling. ""We haven't had such high country fishing opportunities like this is almost a decade. This is definitely the year to get out. Anglers in the high country already report harvesting much larger than normal trout that we call holdovers,"" says Fisheries Branch Chief Larry Riley.      This is the year. Be sure to get your 2005 fishing license and trout stamp. It should also be a remarkable small game year; it is a good time to get a combination hunting and fishing license. Youth get a special deal: a combination hunting and fishing license is just $25.50, which is less than the cost of an adult fishing license with a trout stamp.       Northern Pike Discovered at Fools Hollow Lake    Recent netting surveys at Fools Hollow Lake near Show Low found high numbers of walleyes, most in the 7- to 11-pound range, but the survey also revealed large numbers of illegally introduced northern pike, ranging from a small 15-incher to a larger 12 pounder. The 12-pound pike had three stocker size rainbow trout in its stomach, showing the voracious nature of the species.      Another pike had just eaten a small bass. The Arizona Game and Fish Department is asking anglers to report violators who illegally transport live fish and spoil angling opportunities for others. The department is also asking anglers to harvest any pike they catch and not to release any pike back into the lake. As always in all of Apache, Navajo, and Coconino counties, all harvested fish must be killed before leaving the lake.                                                                                                                                                                                                          back                                       to top                                                                                                   Central                                     Arizona                                                                                                     URBAN LAKES - The greater Phoenix area urban lakes were stocked last week with channel catfish. Fishing for catfish is good to excellent. The top bait for the 16- to 20-inch channel catfish is worms fished on the bottom. Other baits such as hot dogs, stink baits and shrimp have worked well. Sunfish and bass are biting well. The sunfish are biting aggressively on small worms or mealworms. Some nice catches of largemouth bass are being reported using small plastic worms and grubs. Catch-and-release fishing for bass is encouraged. Phoenix and Tucson urban lakes are due to be stocked with catfish this week. Trout fishing at Green Valley Lake (Payson) continues to be good to excellent for anglers using Power Bait or worms. For more information, see our  Urban                                           Fishing Bulletin .       TEMPE TOWN LAKE - Some bass are biting on crankbaits and plastic worms fished along the ledges. One angler even caught a small bass live on a morning TV show using a 3-inch grub. Yellow bass and bluegill will take mealworms under a bobber. Catfish averaging about 1 pound are biting on shrimp.      LAKE PLEASANT - Water level is at 1,700 feet (98-percent full). The Agua Fria is flowing at 25 cfs. The Agua Fria arm of the lake is open: the eagle nest failed. Largemouth bass fishing slowed down some following the windy cold front that moved through the state, but should bounce right back by the time you read this. Some bass are still guarding nests and fry, but mostly it is a post-spawn bite. Prior to the windy weather, anglers were catching bass on topwater off major points, islands and reefs. The best bite last weekend was working the secondary points inside coves, especially over structure. Water temperatures are in the low 70s. Sight fishing is decent in the very backs of coves and near the dam. Fish are being caught on plastics, either drop shot, or Texas- and Carolina-rigged worms. Crankbaits and spinnerbaits are also working at times. White bass have moved back into the lake and can be found in the Agua Fria arm of the lake. They will hit live shad, jigs (quarter-ounce white curly tails) and minnows. Striped bass can be caught trolling in the main lake near the dam using deep plugs and also shad. Bluegill, catfish and carp should become active in the next few weeks once water temps stay above 70 degrees.       ROOSEVELT LAKE - The Lake is 96-percent full at elevation 2,146 feet. The lake has approximately 3 more vertical feet to rise to reach 100-percent capacity. The Salt River was flowing at 1,220 cfs Tuesday morning and Tonto Creek was at 60 cfs. Lots of new cover and added nutrients point to a fantastic spring for bass and crappie. The lake should also experience tremendous shad spawn this year. Fishing is hit-or-miss. A bass club last weekend did well using soft plastic jerkbaits fished along points and secondary points just off the wind line. Some anglers are getting skunked while others are doing fairly well. Last week we received lots of reports of folks fishing but not correlating to a lot of catching. Dark males are being caught now in the Salt arm. Try backs of coves; Kalin jigs and pumpkin seed chartreuse jigs 1/32 ounce are working. Use live minnows under a slip bobber. Anglers are reporting 10-40 fish on good days. Some crappie fishermen are doing well at night. Fishing for smallmouth bass can be good; try using in-line spinners and crayfish imitations especially off rocky points and cliff walls. Remember the slot is in place for smallmouth as well. Carp fishing is fantastic with corn or dough bait. Catfish are starting to bite as well. Use hotdogs, stink baits, or shrimp. Get out on Roosevelt as much as possible when the water is rising to familiarize yourself with what will be underwater structure. Please harvest largemouth bass under the 13-inch slot. Call the Mesa Game and Fish office at (480) 324-3544 if you catch a tagged flathead catfish. Note: anglers are reminded of the slot bass size limit that remains in effect at Roosevelt. Bass between 13 to 16 inches must be released immediately. Also those bass below 13 inches and above 16 inches that are kept can only be gutted with the head and tail attached so the legal length can be determined. All other fish such as crappie, catfish and bluegill harvested from the lake must have a piece of skin attached to the fillets so species can be determined.       APACHE - Lake is 94-percent full at 1,909 feet. Largemouth bass fishing is poor. Try the mouths of coves and off points. Tight-lining drop shots either Carolina-rigged or Texas-rigged worms can be effective. Walleye can be caught off cliffs and rocky points with in-line spinners or drifting night crawlers. Try rock-runners with worm harnesses or shad-patterned crankbaits for walleye after dark. Yellow bass can be found around balls of shad. Spoons and cut bait work well for them. Catfishing is picking up. Carp fishing is excellent; a 12.5 cyprinid won the big fish at the annual camp carp held here last week. The Arizona Game and Fish Department is tagging walleye with a blue spaghetti-type tag near the dorsal fin. If you catch one, please note the tag number, location caught and accurate length of the fish and call the department's Mesa office at (480) 324-3544. You can keep the tag and the fish. There is a certified scale at the marina boathouse. Game and Fish biologists conducted a fish survey last week. Yellow bass were caught all over the lake in high numbers and some were close to state records. Largemouth bass to an extent and smallmouth bass populations in particular have taken a big hit. Not sure what has happened to the smallmouth bass, other than we cannot find them in traditional sampling areas where in past surveys they fill up our nets. All other fish species appear to be in good shape, health wise, densities and age distribution. We will be looking into options on what we can do re-establish what was an excellent smallmouth bass fishery. Any comments or input on this subject is welcomed and wanted as I am keeping track from the angling public for our region. Call me at (480) 324-3544 or e-mail rwiggins@gf.state.az.us      CANYON - Lake is 95-percent full at 1,659 feet. Many anglers are reporting 10-20 fish days; others say they are having a tough time getting a bite. For bass, drop shotting is still the method of choice. Senkos and Westy Worms have also been catching fish. Target smallmouth with crawdad imitation lures right at dark. At night try noisy topwater lures and crankbaits near shad boils. This is also a great lake for yellow bass; jig spoons in and around balls of shad. A few walleye are being caught trolling along cliffs. Shad imitation Rat-L-Traps can be effective for walleye here. Catfish, sunfish and carp fishing are picking up.       SAGUARO - Lake level is 1,524 feet (95-percent full). Bass fishing has been good on most days. There was a shad die-off in the main basin, but not in the river segment of the lake. Anglers fishing the river segment have reported decent results, while some anglers in the main basin have said fishing is tough. Drop shotting and T-rigged worms are catching fish. Jigging is also working at times with white curly tail jigs. Yellow bass can be caught jigging spoons (quarter-ounce KastMaster) or cut bait. There are recent reports of yellows are being caught in the Butcher Jones Cove area. Another good area for yellows is near Ship Rock and the no wake buoys in the channel. Try to locate shad in 40-60 feet of water and jig through them. Catfishing is good. Try stinking baits, hotdogs or shrimp. Some nice cats 5-12 pounds are being caught neat Bagley Flats. There is a certified scale at the marina to get an official weight and still release your catch. Two witnesses are needed for the weight to be official.       BARTLETT - This has been a fishing hot spot for more than a month. Lake level is at 1,799 feet (99-percent full). Lots of reports from anglers who are catching 1- to 4-pound bass consistently, sometimes racking up 30 or 40 catch-and-release fish in a day using a variety of methods. Apparently it doesn't matter if you are flipping jigs, crankbaits, spinners, plastics or even spinnerbaits, the bite is on. Crawdad imitations and worming rigs (d-shot and Texas) are producing, although fishing did drop off a bit last week for bass. Crappies are being caught at night using lights. During the day try newly submerged vegetation along the shoreline and in coves. They will hit minnows and jigs. A live minnow rigged under a slip-bobber can be deadly. Try varying depths from 6-15 feet. Once fish are located continue to fish at that depth. Catfishing is good. Some channel and large flatheads may still be caught near the dam. Use live bait such as bluegill or small carp for the flatheads and shrimp, hotdogs or stink bait for the channels. Remember the live bait most come from the lake itself not transported from another body of water!       HORSESHOE - Lake is temporarily holding water (100 percent). Fishing is poor. Upstream from Horseshoe Dam is an unlimited harvest area for all game fish. The deep pool below the dam (Catfish Point) is known for producing flathead and channel cats. The Colorado pikeminnow and the razorback sucker are endangered and must be released immediately.       VERDE RIVER - Monday morning flows were 300 cfs just above Horseshoe Lake. We will be doing a fish survey next week, at which time I will let you know what we find. Soon the river will be fishable above horseshoe. This area in general is good for smallmouth, largemouth and catfish. It will be interesting to see what we find after the huge winter floods this year. Remember that no baitfish can be transported into this part of the river (above Horseshoe). For further information concerning regulations, call the Arizona Game and Fish Department at (480) 324-3544.       LOWER SALT RIVER (below Saguaro Lake) - Rainbow trout were stocked last week at Blue Point Bridge and Water Users Park. Spinners, KastMasters and Power Bait will work. Some bass can be found in the portion above the Verde confluence. They will hit spinners, crankbaits and night crawlers. In a recent survey many largemouth bass were caught ranging from 1-5 pounds. Look for back eddies next to submerged brush.      CREEKS - Haigler, Workman, Christopher, Tonto, E. Verde River and Canyon creek have all been stocked with rainbow trout recently. Canyon Creek also received 500 brown trout but reportedly is not accessible via motor vehicle because of a timber salvage operation. Use spinners (Rooster Tails, Mepps or Vibrex) corn, worms or Power Bait.                                                                                                                                                                                                          back                                       to top                                                                                                   Colorado                                     River Northwest                                                                                                     LAKE POWELL - By Wayne Gustaveson. Lake elevation: 3,564. Water Temp: 58 - 65. Fish are wondering what happened to spring? Warm days in April got them excited about spawning. Now May is here and it seems like March. Water temperatures hover around 60 degrees but fish are looking for that quick warming to trigger more spawning. While waiting most fish are hovering between deep and shallow water. But they can be caught.      Bass fishing is the best bet. Old nests from the first spawn in April are now 8 feet deeper due to rising lake levels. Fishing the shallow shoreline is not as productive as dropping a plastic tube or grub over the first ledge and letting it fall 5-15 feet. Bass are close to the deepwater edge of shallow rocky structure where nests are built. On a warm afternoon or when the wind blows they will come back on top of the rock. When the water cools due to wind or evening temperatures, they drop back into deeper water.      For best results in cool weather, use small baits like Berkeley Power Grubs, or tiny Yamamoto grubs on eighth-ounce jig heads. Toss the jig near brush or debris and let it slowly settle around limbs and branches. This method can also produce some walleye. Find a patch of floating driftwood and debris and poke the jig under the floating mat to find fish using the floating cover for a hiding spot. When the temperature rises in the afternoon, use larger baits and retrieve more quickly to catch fish. Matching the mood of the fish is important to success. Find the right speed and color to enhance the catch. When it quits working then change one of the variables until fish start to bite once more. Another great technique is to use suspending jerk baits. When water is cold, pause as long as 5-10 seconds between jerks.      These bass fishing techniques will catch many different kinds of fish during May. Expect crappie, bluegill, walleye, green sunfish, catfish and carp to be caught on the same bait in the same cove.       Striped bass are off feed now waiting to spawn. They have not quit feeding, just relaxed the relentless pursuit of shad. Being the biggest fish in town causes baitfish to run away from striper spawning concentrations. Stripers are chasing each other instead of looking for food, which causes a separation between stripers and shad. Catching requires specific methods. Stripers will eat when a food item is placed in front of them. Trolling deep-running (25-40 feet) baits in the backs of canyons is still effective. Using fire tiger or baits with a fluorescent orange belly increases success when fish are lethargic. Stripers are moving in the main channel. Trolling the intersection of the main channel and canyon mouth is productive but not fast.      With stripers prowling and not chasing shad, fishing anchovies at 40-60 feet is a good bet. Stripers have recently been caught at the dam. It is reasonable to expect that historical anchovy fishing spots will be good as long as the cold weather persists. Try the dam, power plant intake, Halls and Moki walls for bait fishing.       Best striper fishing is in the southern half of Lake Powell. Wahweap to Rock Creek is best with stripers found recently in every canyon. Muddy water extends down to Tapestry Wall in the main channel. Fishing for most species is tough upstream from Bullfrog.          Warming will change fish location and fishing success. For this week, go small for bass and deep for stripers.      LEES FERRY - Report courtesy of  Lees Ferry Anglers . The sun was out and the skies were clear this past week. The average high was in the mid seventies and the low for the mornings was in the sixties. The powers that be (a.k.a. the dam authorities) have changed the flows on us again. The high flows have changed from 8,000 cfs to 13,000 cfs. The lows will remain constant at 5,000 cfs. This change in flows has deterred the fish from eating flies. Hopefully, the fish will settle back into their regular feeding routines by the beginning of next week and the fishing will take a turn for the better. As for now, you have to be on your game to catch lots of fish at the Ferry. Experienced and novice fisherman alike are struggling on the water. It can be frustrating to see so many fish in the water and not get them to turn on your fly. Suggest changing flies regularly and trying different locations on the water. Those fish are going to have to eat sometime.         LAKE MEAD - No new reports. Largemouth bass are spawning in many coves. The lake has been stable for the last few weeks and the bass are taking advantage. Plastic lizards and Senkos have all been working well. Reports of stripers have been trickling with most anglers catching a few using anchovies in the Gregg Basin area. There have been no reports on catfish.       LAKE MOHAVE - Striper fishing continues to be good here with anchovies being the most popular choice for bait. The boating activity is picking up. For a little more quiet time on the lake, go early. If you're not an early riser, fish for stripers right at sunset and before the moon rises. If you're fishing from a boat, the hot spots have been near AZ Telephone Cove and the power lines. If you're fishing from shore, try Davis Dam, Princess Cove, and Cabinsite. No new reports on catfish.      TOPOCK MARSH - The marsh water level is up and navigating through the marsh is much easier. Still be aware of underground hazards. Crappie fishing dropped off a little last week as water levels at the marsh continued to rise. However, the bass fishing remained good. Anglers continue to do well catching up to 15 inch stripers along the Colorado River near Golden Shores and the Havasu Refuge. Anchovies have been working well using a 1-ounce weight on the line.        WILLOW BEACH - Fishing for rainbow trout on Friday was good for about an hour after the Stocking, then the action dropped off significantly. Two anglers from Nevada caught nine and seven trout using a gold Super Duper with red dots. One of those trout was 4 pounds. Other lures being used successfully were silver KastMasters, Panther Martins and a brown Rooster Tail. Power Bait was also working well with green, orange, rainbow, lemon twist, salmon peach, sherbet, chartreuse and lime twist all being used successfully. Saturday and Sunday the trout action slowed with just a few trout being caught all with orange Power Bait. Striped bass activity has picked up with several anglers catching striped bass in the 1- to 2-pound range from shore using anchovies. Two anglers caught two catfish also. One group fishing for carp caught eight fish using canned corn.                                                                                                                                                                                                           back                                       to top                                                                                                   Southwestern                                     Arizona                                                                                                   HAVASU - No recent report received. There should not be any change from last week. Largemouth and smallmouth bass fishing is very good. Both largemouth and smallmouth were observed on beds over the weekend; however, much of the population has already entered into a post-spawn pattern. Soft plastics continue to be the most popular baits. Straight-tail plastic worms fished on a drop shot rig and tubes are the go-to baits right now. Dark green, brown and purple have been the colors of choice. Several anglers have reported a topwater bite during early to mid morning hours. The bite can be slow, but it tends to produce some larger fish. Bass are being caught in shallow water inside coves as well as in 10-20 feet of water on points and underwater breaks that drop off into deeper water. Anglers are also catching bass on small crankbaits in the backs of coves and around the artificial fish habitat. Stripper fishing is also good if anglers are able to locate the schools. There is still an early morning topwater bite from first light to about 8 o'clock. Many nice stripers in the 5-pound range are being caught on this pattern. After the topwater bite, anchovies trolled or still fished near the bottom are working best. Striper fishing upriver in the Gorge is also good. Anchovies fished in deeper water have been most productive. The catfish bite is also starting to pickup. Anglers using night crawlers and anchovies have been the most successful. It should only be a couple of weeks before the catfish bite is in full swing. REMEMBER: THE SNAGGING SEASON IS NOW CLOSED. It will be unlawful for anglers to snag shad until the season opens again in October (see the 2005-2006 regulations for additional information). In addition: smallmouth and largemouth bass must be a minimum of 13 inches to possess. All largemouth and smallmouth bass less than 13 inches must be released immediately.      PARKER STRIP - No recent reports have been received for this area. The same conditions as last week should still be true. Water levels are expected to remain high for the next few weeks, with the exception of Thursdays when releases are held back. Catfishing should be picking up with the warmer weather and longer days. Use baits like night crawlers, cut anchovies or chicken livers for channel cats. For the larger, more predatory flatheads, only live bait will do. Anglers have some success with shad, bluegill, or small goldfish. Night crawlers are a good choice for the pan-filling sunfish that inhabit the Parker Strip. A number of 2- to 3-pound bluegill-redear hybrids have been pulled from these waters in the last few years. For a challenge, try landing one on a fly rod with a fly or midge. The bass bite should still be on. Soft baits were working well for both large and small mouth.       MARTINEZ LAKE/COLORADO RIVER - No recent reports have been received for this area. Martinez Lake boat anglers recently enjoyed some good success fishing for bass in the back coves and submerged structure. Plastics seemed to be working well.       MITTRY LAKE - Channel catfish and bass fishing is picking up. It was reported that fishing for channel catfish with a bobber about 18 inches above a worm was working extremely well this last weekend.        YUMA AREA RIVERS/CANALS - No recent reports have been received for this area. Anglers have been catching striped bass are schooling in the Gila Main Canal and biting on chicken livers.        FORTUNA POND - No recent reports have been received for this area. A couple of anglers recently caught limits of channel catfish using shrimp as bait. Bluegills are plentiful in the pond and have been biting worms for bait.      REDONDO POND - No recent reports have been received for this area. ""Yuma Lakes"" anglers should fish this pond with a float tube to be effective. Both bass and bluegill dominate here.      YUMA WEST WETLANDS POND - No recent reports have been turned in for this area. Effective January 2005, the daily bag/possession limits for fish caught at the Yuma West Wetlands Pond is two trout, one largemouth bass (13-inch minimum), two channel catfish and five sunfish of any combination. For detailed information see the 2005-2006 Arizona Game and Fish Department's fishing regulations.       EHRENBERG - No recent reports have been received for this area. Fishing for flatheads will continue to bite on bluegill or other live bait in the main channel. Worms and green crankbaits will continue to attract bass in the backwaters. Just a reminder, Cibola Lake is open to fishing.        ALAMO LAKE - No much has changed this week in the wide world of bass fishing. It's still tough. High winds every day have kept most anglers off the lake. The best fishing is still early mornings throwing spinner baits and plastic lizards. Local anglers have found that watermelon color works the best. The bass are still holding tight to the points and hiding in the brush. Crappie fishing has picked up. The night bite is on. Anglers have been going out in the evenings using lights and minnows and catching between 20 and 40 crappie a night. For the best luck try fishing the coves up by the dam. Look for about 30 foot of water on your graph, set out yours light out, and fish about 8 feet down. The bite seems to start about 10 p.m. and last till around midnight, or later. Minnows, split shot, and small hooks are the hot ticket. Catfishing is doing okay. Most catfish are being caught in the upper part of the lake using minnows and livers. The lake is still at 1,136 and should remain at this level until the end of the month. Were not sure if the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers will dump the additional 11 feet to bring the lake down to 1,125 or release it slowly. Cholla Ramp is still under water. No news on the store at this time. There is a fish advisory here. The advisory recommends that people limit consumption as follows for bass and black crappie: Children under age six: no consumption; Women of childbearing age: one 8-ounce fish meal per month; All other adult women: three 8-ounce fish meals per month; Adult men: four 8-ounce fish meal per month. For catfish, the consumption guideline is slightly different: for children under the age of six, no consumption is recommended; for women of child-bearing age, one 8-ounce fish meal per month; for all other adult women, five 8-ounce fish meals per month; for adult men, six 8-ounce meals per month. If you have any questions, call the park (928) 669-2088.                                                                                                                                                                                                           back                                       to top                                                                                                   North                                     Central Region                                                                                                     Note: Campgrounds on the Kaibab National Forest Opened April 29. The Forest Service is still conducting maintenance on the facilities, including pumping flood waters from bathrooms, and removing slash piles from trees that were cut down due to bark beetle damage. Please thank the Forest for opening the campgrounds early instead of waiting until all the work was finished.      WILLIAMS LAKES:         KAIBAB LAKE - Gate is open. Scheduled to be stocked this week.       CATARACT LAKE - Gate is open. Trout fishing was good on Power Bait. Scheduled to be stocked this week.      CITY RESERVOIR - Gate is open.

Anglers at the middle lagoon were having good luck two weekends ago when the rain let them fish. Anglers were catching trout using Power Bait and flies. Lots of anglers report catching limits of trout relatively easily. The problem otters have not been seen at the lagoons in several weeks.        LYNX LAKE - Fishing at Lynx last weekend continued to be good. Spinners and flies were working well on the brown trout. Remember, brown trout don't take Power Bait like the rainbow trout do, so try night crawlers, spinners, flies and minnow lures. Next stocking is scheduled for the week of May 16.        FAIN LAKE - No new reports. Due to be stocked this week.      VERDE RIVER - No new reports. Stocked at the White Bridge in Camp Verde on April 8 with 800 rainbow trout. That stocking was the last for the spring season. Young anglers participating in a fishing workshop on April 9 caught several of the stocked trout as well as a carp and a largemouth bass.      GOLDWATER LAKE - No new reports. Last stocked with trout on April 18. Goldwater is due to be stocked this week. This little lake just off Senator Highway holds the state record for hybrid sunfish. It's a great place to take the youngsters.                                                                                                                                                                                                           back                                       to top                                                                                                   Mogollon                                     Rim                                                                                                   Note: All major roads on the forest to popular fishing locations are now open, providing access to Willow Springs Lake, Woods Canyon Lake, Bear Canyon Lake, Black Canyon Lake, Chevelon Canyon Lake, Big, Crescent, and Hulsey Lake as well as major stream locations such as Sheep's Crossing, Little Colorado River at Greer, and all Black River access points.          CHEVELON CANYON LAKE - Forest Road 300 and FR 169 are open. The lake is full and spilling. Recent netting surveys found good numbers of 10-14 inch rainbow trout and several brown trout in the 2-5-pound range. Chevelon Canyon Lake is open to artificial lure and fly only. The bag limit is six fish, however a slot limit is in effect on the lake and trout between 10-14 inches may not be possessed. Trout taken from Chevelon Canyon Lake shall be immediately killed and retained as part of the bag limit or immediately released. Try lures such as KastMasters, Z-Rays, Panther Martin spinners, and Rapalas. Fly fishers should try wooly buggers or wooly worms in black or brown colors. Three different anglers have reported good fishing success in the stream, especially just below the spillway, downstream from Chevelon. One angler said he and his buddies caught lots of fish up to one-half mile below the dam. Another angler fishing from a boat said he caught lots of big fish, including a couple of browns pushing 20 inches long, by trolling gold-colored Rapalas.      BEAR CANYON LAKE - Forest Road 300 and 89 are open to the lake. The lake is full and spilling. Fishing is fair to good. The lake will be stocked with catchable size rainbow trout this week. Try worms, Power Bait, lures (Z-Rays, Panther Martin, Mepps, and Rooster Tail spinners), and flies (woolly worms and woolly buggers).       BLACK CANYON LAKE - Forest Road 86 is open from Heber and Forest Road 300 south of Highway 260 is open to Black Canyon Lake. The lake is full and spilling. Spring netting surveys found good numbers of small carryover rainbow trout, but no large trout as were found in the previous two years. Try worms, Power Bait, lures (Z-Rays and spinners), and flies (woolly buggers). The lake was last stocked with catchable size rainbow trout the week of May 2. Fishing is good.       WILLOW SPRINGS LAKE - The road is open. The lake is full and spilling. Spring netting surveys found fair numbers of small rainbow trout, with a couple 13-inch carryovers. The lake will be stocked with catchable size rainbow trout this week and weekly through September. Fishing is good. Try worms, Power Bait, lures such as Z-Rays and Panther Martin spinners and flies such as woolly worms and woolly buggers.        WOODS CANYON LAKE - Forest Roads are open to the lake. The lake is full and spilling. Spring netting surveys found good numbers of 10-14 inch rainbow trout with a few brown trout that averaged 5 pounds. Fishing is fair to good. Two anglers report catching-and-releasing 20 trout in a morning, including three large browns from 3 to 5 pounds, using spinning rods with casting floats and wooly buggers (big flies) on a tapered fly leader. Try worms, Power Bait, lures such as Z-Rays, spinners, and crayfish crank baits. Flies such as wooly buggers and wooly worms are also effective. An angler recently caught a 7-pound brown trout near the boat ramp on a crayfish colored crank bait. Anglers have been catching rainbows on Power Bait and worms. The lake will be stocked with catchable size rainbow trout this week and weekly through September.                                                                                                                                                                                                            back                                       to top                                                                                                   White                                     Mountains                                                                                                   Note To Anglers: State Routes 273 and 261 (Roads to Big Lake) are open.           BECKER LAKE - The lake is open and full. The boat ramp is accessible. Fishing is good. The lake is open to artificial lure and flies only from Oct. 1 through May 24. There is a two-fish limit. Fly fishers should try brown wooly buggers, damselfly and dragonfly patterns, Montana nymphs, peacock ladies, and midge larvae patterns. Fly fishers are catching 8-12 inch rainbows and a few rainbows over 15 inches. Lures such as small spinners, KastMasters, and Z-Rays are also effective. An angler recently caught a rainbow trout over 20 inches with a Z-Ray from the boat ramp.       BIG LAKE - Highways 273 and 261 are open. The lake is open. The lake level is up about 2 feet from last year. Fishing is good. One angler says he and his two sons easily caught a limit of nice trout using Power Bait in a deep hole near shore. Another angler reports catching a hard-fighting 4-pound cutthroat trout on a Mepps spinner bounced along the bottom in about 10 feet of water. Shore anglers are catching rainbow trout 12-16 inches, brook trout 10-14 inches, and a few cutthroat trout 16-17 inches on worms and Power Bait (rainbow colored, green, orange, and yellow). Spring netting surveys found good numbers of rainbow trout up to 16 inches, brook trout up to 14 inches, and cutthroat trout up to 21 inches. Boat ramp access at the main ramp and at South Cove is good. The Railroad Cove boat ramp is good for float tubes. There is still soft mud at the end of the ramp.       CARNERO LAKE - Forest Roads are open to the lake. The lake is full. The water temperature was 52 degrees. Spring netting surveys found good numbers of 1-3 pound rainbow trout. The lake is weedy around the shoreline. The lake is open to artificial lure and fly only, barbless hooks, and a 2-trout bag limit. A small boat or float tube is ideal for this lake. There is open water past the weed lines. Try lures such as Z-Rays, KastMasters, spinners (Mepps, Panther Martin, and Rooster Tail) and flies like wooly worms, wooly buggers, damselfly patterns, and brown Montana stone nymphs.        CONCHO LAKE - Fishing is fair. The lake is approximately 4.5 feet down, but the main boat ramp is good for launching boats. Spring netting surveys found good numbers of carryover rainbow trout, most in the 1-2 pound size. Try using worms, Power Bait, lures, and flies early in the day when the pH levels are lowest. PH levels will rise in the afternoon because of direct sunlight, making trout sluggish. The lake was stocked with catchable size rainbow trout on April 6 and again on April 8. The lake will not be stocked until water quality conditions improve and pH levels decline.      CRESCENT LAKE - State Routes 273 and 261 are open to the lake. The lake is open and about 2 feet higher than last year. Fishing is good. Try worms, Power Bait, lures, and flies. The north and west side boat ramps are accessible. The south boat ramp is still blocked. The lake will be stocked with 8,000 catchable size brook trout and 4,000 catchable size rainbow trout last week.      FOOL HOLLOW LAKE - The lake is full and turbid, which means it has had some nutrient loading. That should help fish grow outs. Both boat ramps are accessible. Fishing is fair to good for trout. Try worms, Power Bait, lures, and flies near structure such as rocks, tree stumps, and weed beds. The lake will be stocked with catchable size rainbow trout next week. Fool Hollow also contains walleye, northern pike, channel catfish, largemouth and smallmouth bass, sunfish, and black crappie.  Recent netting surveys found high numbers of walleyes, most in the 7- to 11-pound range. The survey also found large numbers of illegally introduced northern pike, ranging from a small 15-inch pike to a large 12 pounder. The 12-pound pike had 3 stocker size rainbow trout in its stomach, showing the voracious nature of the species. Another pike had just eaten a small bass. We are asking anglers to report violators who illegally transport live fish and spoil angling opportunities for others. Anglers are being asked to harvest any pike they catch and not to release them back into the lake. As always in all of Apache, Navajo, and Coconino counties, all harvested fish must be killed before leaving the lake. Channel catfish, smallmouth and largemouth bass, bluegills, black crappies, and carp were also caught during the surveys, but in lower numbers.        GREER LAKES - Bunch and Tunnel reservoirs are full and will be stocked with catchable size rainbow trout this week. Fishing should be good. Anglers have been catching trout on Rooster Tail spinners. River Reservoir has come up quite a bit with the heavy snowmelt but will be drained back down to minimum pool immediately because of dam safety concerns. Repairs to the dam are scheduled this summer. Scheduled stockings at River Reservoir have been diverted to other lakes. However, some large brown trout likely remain in the reservoir. Boats can be launched at River Reservoir at the current water level but should become more difficult as water is released and high flows decrease.      HULSEY LAKE - Forest Road 56 is open to Hulsey Lake on the side of Escudilla Mountain. This pint-size lake is full, spilling, and open. Fishing is good. The lake was last stocked with catchable size rainbow trout the week of May 2. Try worms, Power Bait, lures, and flies.       LEE VALLEY RESERVOIR - State Route 273 is open to the lake. The lake is full and spilling. The lake is open to artificial lures and flies only, two-fish bag limit, with a minimum size of 12 inches. Spring netting surveys found some nice sized Apache trout that survived the winter. These trout were 15-16 inches. The lake will be stocked this week with 5,000 catchable size apache trout. Anglers should try lures such as Rooster Tail, Mepps, and Panther Martin spinners. Fly fishers should try small Peacock ladies, Prince nymphs, Hares ear nymphs, caddis fly nymphs, mayfly nymphs, and damselfly nymphs in sizes 14-16. The water temperature last week was 50 degrees.          LUNA LAKE - The lake is fairly clear and full. Fishing is fair. Spring netting surveys found good numbers of cutthroat trout with fair numbers of rainbow trout that carried  "

By  John Fischer , About.com    Filed In: A Hawaii Vacation Planner   >  Radio   TV   Movies >  Survivor: Vanuatu      Where is Vanuatu? Vanuatu Tourism Office            Country Name  Republic of Vanuatu (formerly New Hebrides Islands)   Location  Vanuatu is located about three-quarters of the way from Hawaii to Australia. It is west  of Fiji and north of New Caledonia in the area known as Melanesia.   Principal Islands  The four major islands which make up about half of the land area are in order of size - Espiritu Santo, Malekula, Erromango and Efate. Other large islands are Ambrym, Tanna, Epi, Vanua Lava, Gaua (Santa Maria), Ambae, Maewo, and Pentecost.   Land Area  4709 square miles (slightly larger than Connecticut)  12 main islands, 58 inhabited islets, numerous uninhabited islets   Sea Area  262549 square miles   Capital  Port-Vila on the island of Efate (population 32,000)    Government  Vanuatu is a parliamentary republic. The Head of State is President Father John Bani (since 1999). The Prime Minister is Edward Nipake Natapei (since 2001). The British and French, who settled the New Hebrides in the 19th century, agreed in 1906 to an Anglo-French Condominium, which administered the islands until independence was granted on July 30, 1980.   Terrain  The islands of Vanuatu consist mostly of mountains of volcanic origin, some of which remain active to this day. Many of the islands have narrow coastal plains. The highest point is Mt. Tabwemasana (6158 feet) on the island of Espiritu Santo.   Climate  Vanuatu has a tropical climate meaning that it is hot and wet. The islands do enjoy a southeast trade wind. The average humidity exceeds 80%. The islands experience occasional cyclones or typhoons from January to April. The islands also have a history of earthquakes which are sometimes followed by tsunamis (tidal waves).   Population  199,414 (July 2003 est.) The majority of the people are indigenous Melanesians (98%). The remainder of the population includes French, Vietnamese, Chinese and other Pacific Islanders.    Principal Languages  Bislama or Bichelama (pidgin), English, French and over 100 local languages.   Time  UTC + 11 hours   Principal Exports  The economy is based primarily on subsistence or small-scale agriculture, which provides a living for 65% of the population. Fishing, offshore financial services, and tourism, with about 50,000 visitors in 1997, are other mainstays of the economy. Principal exports include copra, beef, coffee, cocoa, timber, shells.

Carlisle Bay is also home to 5 wrecks making it a favorite for wreck aficionados. Visitors can experience the islands sophisticated and active lifestyle through its luxurious resorts, fine restaurants, world class golf and especially its passion for its national sport, cricket.

Known as the ""shipwreck capital"" of the Caribbean, Barbados offers    a number of unique and interesting diving and snorkeling features that include    a number of accessible sunken ships and a host of beautiful coral formations    and marine life.    The west coast has two designated snorkeling areas, both part of the Folkestone    Marine Park and the south coast’s best snorkeling area is the Carlisle    Bay Marine Park. The diving is easily accessible and not particularly technical,    and the island’s facilities are excellent, including a decompression chamber    situated near Bridgetown and many well-equipped dive centers found on the west    and south coasts.    The most famous of the wrecks, the Stavronikita, has created a fascinating    penetration dive for experienced divers.    Water temperature is a warm 82-84°F in the summer and 78-80°F in the    winter. Most people will find a 3mm suit adequate for diving in Barbados.   Barbados is blessed with steady trade winds, beckoning waves and crystal clear    water that make it ideal for windsurfing and kitesurfing. The south coast is    the place to be and the best time to hoist a sail is normally December through    mid-March.     Passport and/or Visa Requirements   Every person entering Barbados, including all North American citizens (Americans    and Canadians), should be in possession of a valid passport and a valid return    ticket.   EXIT REQUIREMENTS: Bds $25 for all departures. Passengers in transit who will    be remaining in Barbados for less than 24 hours and children under 12 are exempt.   Immunizations   Vaccinations are not required for entry into Barbados. Exception: Yellow Fever  vaccination certificate is required from travellers over one (1) year of age,  coming from infected areas. Check with the Centers for Disease Control on recommended  vaccinations for travel  www.cdc.gov .    Culture and Customs    The Caribbean is full of people who are larger than life. Barbadians (Bajans)    are different from other caribbean personalities in many ways. They are more    spiritual and religiously conscious. They are by nature open, thoughtful and    generous. They love a party but will have time for anyone, they like people,    no matter what background, race, and disposition. They make time for quiet and    shy people and draw them out with disarming innocence and charm. They will rise    to the occasion on any occasion to shoot the breeze and laugh and joke with    the most outrageous personalities of our time. It is not at all ironic that    there are more churches per capita than most other island nations. The only    thing more numerous than churches are rum shops.    There are a few festivals to make note of. In mid February, there is the Holetown    Festival, which is a family attraction commemorating the first landing and settlement    in Barbados on February 17, 1627. The Holetown Festival combines folk, gospel    and medieval music with a street parade and fair and a torch-lit evening exhibition    by the Royal and Mounted Police forces as they perform the floodlit Tattoo.    Other activities include poetry, drama, sidewalk art shows, sports, games, local    handicrafts markets and the popular Queen of the Festival Pageant.   From the end of February through mid-March, you can take part in the Holders    Season festival. This most sophisticated festival offers an exciting season    of opera, classical, jazz, latin and caribbean music and takes place at the    historic Holders Plantation House, situated on a ridge overlooking what were    once extensive sugar and tobacco fields. The event, which is internationally    recognized and has attracted such musical luminaries as Luciano Pavarotti, is    currently focused on the development and exhibition of local talent.   Barbados is an island filled with artistic talent .... from skilled local potters    at work fashioning their wares as has been done for centuries, to modern fashion    designers, abstract artists and poets.   The people of Barbados have a history of long ingrained Christian principles,    a sound and free educational system with a literacy rate of 97%     Electricity, Telephone and Internet Access    Electricity in Barbados is 110 volts/50 cycles (hairdryers and shavers from    North America do not need a converter but if needed can usually be borrowed    from your hotel).   The island uses solar power mainly for hot-water systems.    Barbados has a modern telecommunications infrastructure with the latest in    digital technology and fiber optics systems including international direct dialing,    facsimile transfer and satellite telecommunications which allows for the efficient    transmission of electronic data.    Internet and e-mail services, as well as express mail and courier delivery,    are also available. The international direct long distance dialing code for    Barbados is (1–246), followed by a seven digit local number.    Water Quality    The water service in Barbados is reliable and the water supply is safe and    refreshing to drink straight from the tap.    Language & Currency    English is the official language of Barbados, although the Bajan dialect can    be heard all around the island.   The Barbados Dollar is converted at the rate of $1.98 BDS to $1.00 U.S. The    Barbados Dollar is fixed to the U.S Dollar and does not fluctuate. Its rate    to other currencies fluctuates daily based on their fluctuations relative to    the U.S. Dollar.   US currency is accepted across the island, and most stores and restaurants    accept major credit cards and travellers cheques. Most Barbados hotels, restaurants    and businesses will accept credit cards. Travelers cheques are also cashable    at many outlets.    There are many commercial banks in Barbados (mostly British and Canadian) and    most have ABMs (also known as ATM's) that will accept credit cards. They all    dispense funds in Barbados dollars at the current rate of exchange.    Time    4 hours behind GMT. 1 hour ahead of US Eastern Standard Time (EST) in the    winter and the same time as US Eastern Daylight Saving Time in the summer.    History, Art, and Culture    The history of Barbados is as rich and fascinating as the island itself. It    is believed that the island’s first inhabitants were the Amerindians,    who reached its shores around 1623 BC by open canoe from the Orinoco area of    South America, known today as Venezuela. The next 3,000 years brought the settlement    of several tribes, including the peaceful Arawaks and the cannibalistic Caribs.    At the whim of prevailing northeast trade winds, the Spanish and Portuguese    followed in 1537, calling the island “Los Barbados”— perhaps    a nod to their fascination with the hanging, aerial roots of the Bearded Fig    Tree.   By the time the first settlers–the British–chanced upon the island    by virtue of navigational miscalculations in 1627, the Indians had all but disappeared.    For the English, Barbados represented a golden opportunity to acquire a colony    with good potential for agriculture: favorable climate, rich soils and generally    flat land. These early pioneers set about the task of cultivating the land and    instigated a long period of English rule that was to last some 339 years.   The booming sugar industry and slave trade fueled the establishment of an excellent    infrastructure and Barbados’ own Parliament in 1639, making it the third    oldest in the British Commonwealth. Later, Barbados became the first country    to abolish the slave trade in 1834.   Barbados gained independence from Britain on the 30th November 1966 and has    since enjoyed over 40 years as a proudly independent nation.    Location and Size   Barbados is the easternmost island of the West Indies in the Atlantic Ocean.    The island is approximately 300 miles north of Venezuela. Barbados is 166 square    miles, divided into 11 parishes. It's captial city is Bridgetown, with a population    of approx. 99,000.    Although Barbados is a relatively small island (21 miles long and 14 miles    wide), there is much to explore so you should consider renting a car during    your Barbados vacation.   Driving in Barbados is on the left side of the road and the majority of vehicles    are “right hand drive.” The island has an extensive road network    of paved roads. A highway links the north and the south of the island. There    are a number of ways to get around the island by hired car, taxis and buses;    all are safe, reliable and convenient.    Population   Approximately 279,000                                                                                      © Island Exposure    Dive Primer Water Temp: 78-80° Visibility: 60' Wetsuit: 1.5mm to 3mm Best Time to Travel       Year-round     Favorite Dive Sites       Wrecks of the  Stavronikita ,  Eilon ,  Berwyn , and  C-Trek     Topside Attractions       Barbados Wildlife Reserve to see the green monkeys     Harrison's Cave                    We Also Represent                                            Escape Hotel                                                                                                                  Caribbean  ·     Mexico  ·     Central America  ·     Mid-Atlantic  ·     Pacific  ·     Exotics  ·     Ultimate Adventure  ·       Green Policy  ·     Site Map  ·          Terms & Conditions             © 2007 Caradonna Dive Adventures.

Barbados is also home to thousands of species of wildlife.                          With so many  things to do                           while on  vacation                          in Barbados , one of the best ways to experience the                          diversity of the island is by taking Barbados island tours.                                                            The  history  of Barbados dates back hundreds of years ago when fishing was the way that most people their living. If you want to step back into fishing villages that look almost the same as they did 200 years ago, a Barbados day tour will take you to the energetic village of Oistins. The small town features lovely boutiques and restaurants housed in buildings that were once shipping supply warehouses. The main highlight of tours of Barbados that stop in the fishing village is the Oistins Fish Fry. Every Easter hundreds of residents and people on Barbados tours gather in the streets of Oistins to pay tribute to the fishers of the community. There are fish cleaning competitions, boating races, flame swallowing demonstrations, and of course, fresh seafood. A plate of mahi mahi or flying fish can be purchased for around $5.00. Barbados island tours usually wrap up the day by staying in the capital city of  Bridgetown  which is just a few miles away.                                     People who are guests aboard  Caribbean                          cruises  often take a Barbados day tour when they disembark                          the ship in Bridgetown. These tours of Barbados often                          include walking around downtown Bridgetown and even a                          trip to a nearby  beach . Barbados                          tours almost always bring tourists to Careenage, a natural                          harbor in Bridgetown with a pedestrian walkway and a scenic                          marina. You’ll see boaters getting their yachts                          and sail boats ready for an outing as well as street vendors                          selling ice cream and souvenirs. The best place for  shopping                           in this area is on the north side of the Chamberlain Bridge.                          The area gets quite crowded during the weekends with all                          of the Barbados Island tours taking place, so if you don’t                          like crowds, Chamberlain Bridge is an area to avoid.                                     If you want to visit beaches on your vacation, there are many tours of Barbados that will focus on the beaches spanning the west and south coast of Barbados, extending from the north all the way down to  St. Lawrence Gap , which is a two mile stretch of road famous for its beaches,  nightlife , and shopping. You won’t want to miss Mullins Beach in  St. Peter . The water is perfect for swimming and snorkeling. Carlisle Beach in St. Michael is so close to Bridgetown that it is possible to visit the beach for a couple of hours on a Barbados day tour and make it back to Bridgetown in time to board your cruise ship. If you want to buy souvenirs from your tour, head to Bay Street near the beach. You can also rent beach umbrellas or buy refreshments here. Other beaches you might encounter on Barbados tours are Accra Beach, Miami Beach, or Sandy Beach.                       Families with children often take Barbados tours of the  Barbados Wildlife Reserve  on the east coast of St. Peter. This wildlife sanctuary is the habitat of peacocks, birds, deer, and monkeys. There are no fences or cages for the animals (except for the snakes) so be sure to watch where you step.                       Visitors can see so much of Barbados even if they only have one or two days to spend there. The island of Barbados is small, yet packed with great beaches, shopping, and sightseeing activities.                                                                                                                                                                                        contact us              |  travel newsletter              |  travel marketing              |  write for us  |               link to us              |  privacy policy               |  terms of use              |  help                           © 2008  Destination360  All Rights Reserved                                                                                                                  Barbados Map                                    Latest Topics     nice place to stay at Bridg...

Giant Squid: Who’s Chasing Whom?   Mote’s 2008 Special Lecture Series continues next week with the lecture “Who’s Chasing Whom? The Quest for the World’s Largest Calamari, the Giant Squid,” by Dr. Clyde Roper, Zoologist Emeritus at the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of Natural History. On Monday, Jan. 28, Dr. Roper will trace the historical legends and concepts based on the giant squid and present results of his deep-sea expeditions in search of the squid with National Geographic and the Discovery Channel in addition to subsequent attempts by colleagues.   Dr. Roper, an Adjunct Scientist at Mote, has had a long-standing relationship with the organization and was instrumental in obtaining the giant squid specimen that is on permanent exhibit at Mote Aquarium.   The Special Lecture Series will continue every Monday until March 10 and all lectures will take place at 7 p.m. in Mote’s Immersion Cinema located at 1600 Ken Thompson Pkwy., Sarasota.

National Spheniscid Awareness Day (aka, Penguin Day)               Published   by   Jason   on   January 20, 2008   in   Events .        0  Comments                                       Today is  National Peguin Awareness Day . The official declaration is over at the  Peguin Geek  blog.    Unfortunately, the  Monterey Bay Aquarium Penguin Cam  is currently offline, so you can’t celebrate that way. But they are working on a new exhibit which should be open in March. In the meantime, try the other links below.   Penguins are birds. They have feathers, beaks and wings, and they lay eggs. Their closest relatives are other fish-eating seabirds: albatrosses, petrels and shearwaters.   There are currently 17 species of penguins. They range in size from the small two-pound (1 kg), 16-inch (41 cm) little blue penguin to the large 84-pound (38 kg), 51-inch (130 cm) emperor penguin. They’ve adapted to environments as different as Antarctic ice fields and the tropical Galpagos islands. Yet all penguins share their ancestors’ trait: they’re at home in the ocean.

I will be participating in one panel discussion during the conference,  Real-time blogging in the marine sciences  from 9:50-11:00 a.m. (ET).   Moderated by Kevin Zelnio of  The Other 95% , Peter Etnoyer of  Deep Sea News , Karen James of the  Beagle Project , Rick Mac Pherson of  Malaria, Bedbugs, Sea Lice, and Sunsets  and Jason Robertshaw of the  Cephalopodcast .   Our discussion will be initially be focused on the following:  - Using blogs as a tool in Science, Conservation and Marine Education  - Blogs as filters of novel research and synthesizers of concepts  - Communicating Marine Science to the public via blogs (including podcasting and video blogs) to increasing public awareness of Ocean Science and related issues (i.e. who reads marine biology blogs and why).  - Blogging from the field as a method to communicate the scientific method, how research is done and what its like to be a scientist  - The multifaceted constraints of blogging in the field and to what extent blogging does or does not represent the organization you work for.    This is in an unconference format, so everyone who attends the event is encouraged to be an active participant in all of the sessions and discussions.   Also, depending on the bandwidth capabilites available, I will attempt to stream the presentation.     My conference updates will be available at the  Offical Cephalopodcast NC Science Blogging Conference  page   Any streaming will take place at the Cephalopodcast  ustream.tv channel   If ustream fails, I might try  Talkshoe                                           Jumbo Squid Weekend @ Camp Ocean Pines               Published   by   Jason   on   January 17, 2008   in   Under the Bridge .        0  Comments                                       Camp Ocean Pines in Cambria, California has a  number of workshop opportunities  for educators this year. One in particular caught my eye:   Jumbo Squid Dissection, Teacher In-service February 1-3, 2008   The naturalist staff at Camp Ocean Pines have invited  Dr. Bill Gilly , professor of Marine and Organismal Biology at Stanford to lead a study of these amazing squid. This is a great opportunity for hands-on experience with a 30-pound giant Humboldt squid.

Schedule  Friday, wine and cheese social and dinner before Dr. Gilly presents research and insights on the Humboldt Squid. Overnight accommodations available in straw bale cabins (with bathrooms and showers).   Breakfast Saturday morning, when Dr. Gilly will lead a dissection of Humboldt Squid. After this expert instruction, we share our experiences leading squid dissections in the classroom with students. Lesson plans and other handouts will be provided.   Lunch on Saturday and opportunity to join naturalist staff for a kayaking tour of the Morro Bay Estuary or a tour of the local elephant seals.   Saturday night join the staff for a relaxing campfire or visit the local attractions.   The weekend ends Sunday after breakfast and closing ceremony.   Open to science teachers, naturalists, docents, and marine science  educators.   Cost  Option 1 is $195/person (some partial scholarships available). Friday-Sunday, 2 nights lodging, wine reception, five great meals, instruction, kayak rental.   Option 2 is Saturday only $100/person for locals.

Below, the terrain is dotted with plains, mountains, and deep canyons. Now, picture the area seven miles below the surface of the sea. What does it look like? Surprisingly, very similar to the topography of a continent.              The Ocean floor   Before we can understand the importance of the Antarctic oceanic circulation, we must understand the general oceanic circulation patterns of the globe. Remember, all of our oceans are interconnected! First, let's define the distinct areas of the ocean floor (continental shelves, slopes, and rises; ocean basins), then let's look at the general depth zones of the ocean (surface, pycnocline, and deep waters).              Topo Map of the Ocean Floor             Top of Page                 Continental Drift/Plate Tectonics             Introduction to Plate Tectonics   In geologic terms, a plate is a large, rigid slab of solid rock. The word tectonics comes from the Greek root ""to build."" Putting these two words together, we get the term plate tectonics, which refers to how the Earth's surface is built of plates.                  What Drives the Plates   The tectonic plates do not randomly drift or wander about the Earth's surface; they are driven by definite yet unseen forces. Although scientists can neither precisely describe nor fully understand the forces, most believe that the relatively shallow forces driving the lithospheric plates are coupled with forces originating much deeper in the Earth.              Evidence of Sea Floor Spreading    Oceanographic exploration in the 1950s led to a much better understanding of the ocean floor. Among the new findings was the discovery of zebra stripe-like magnetic patterns for the rocks of the ocean floor. These patterns were unlike any seen for continental rocks. Obviously, the ocean floor had a story to tell, but what?             Newfoundland Geology: A Study in Continental Drift    Newfoundland and Labrador has a world class geology. Earth scientists from all over the globe visit the province to study the record of the earth's evolution preserved in its rocks. Not only does it have some of the oldest rocks in the world, but it also has some unusual sequences of rocks which tell a fascinating tale of colliding continents and disappearing oceans in the geological past.              Continental Drift  Continental drift was hotly debated off and on for decades following Wegener's death before it was largely dismissed as being eccentric, preposterous, and improbable. However, beginning in the 1950s, a wealth of new evidence emerged to revive the debate about Wegener's provocative ideas and their implications.               Understanding The Movement of the Plates    Scientists now have a fairly good understanding of how the plates move and how such movements relate to earthquake activity. Most movement occurs along narrow zones between plates where the results of plate-tectonic forces are most evident.              Plate Boundaries    To the biologist lithospheric plate boundaries are of interest in that they produce changing environments. These changing environments have a direct influence on the evolution of the plants and animals of the region. Even though each type of boundary has a different influence on the region there is one characteristic they have in common, they are all tectonically (volcanically) active and unstable often experiencing earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.              Tectonic Plates of the Earth   The earth's surface is broken into seven large and many small moving plates. These plates, each about 50 miles thick, move relative to one another an average of a few inches a year. Three types of movement are recognized at the boundaries between plates: convergent, divergent and transform-fault.              Plate Tectonics   The plate tectonics theory, a revolution in geologic thought, was developed in the 1960s and 1970s, with roots in earlier observations and deductions. Earlier, scientists had noted that continental crust grows by progressive additions and that a midocean ridge, first discovered below the Atlantic, is continuous almost all the way around the world. It was also noted that continental plates rupture, drift apart, and collide.              Plate Tectonics                  Hotspots Under the Earth  The vast majority of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur near plate boundaries, but there are some exceptions. For example, the Hawaiian Islands, which are entirely of volcanic origin, have formed in the middle of the Pacific Ocean more than 3,200 km from the nearest plate boundary. How do the Hawaiian Islands and other volcanoes that form in the interior of plates fit into the plate-tectonics picture?               Plate Tectonic and People   Over geologic time, plate movements in concert with other geologic processes, such as glacial and stream erosion, have created some of nature's most magnificent scenery. The Himalayas, the Swiss Alps, and the Andes are some spectacular examples. Yet violent earthquakes related to plate tectonics have caused terrible catastrophes -- such as the magnitude-7.7 earthquake that struck the Chinese province of Hebei in 1976 and killed as many as 800,000 people.

Most of these marine ecosystems are near the water surface, such as the Great Barrier Reef, a 2,000-km-long coral formation off the northwestern coast of Australia. Coral reefs, like nearly all complex living communities, depend on solar energy for growth (photosynthesis).

Some are active at the present time and, in shallow water, disclose their presence by blasting steam and rock-debris high above the surface of the sea. Many others lie at such great depths that the tremendous weight of the water above them results in high, confining pressure and prevents the formation and explosive release of steam and gases. Even very large, deepwater eruptions may not disturb the ocean surface.

Erosion wears away the high places, transporting its sediments to the continents' edge and depositing them off the edge of the continental shelf onto the sea floor, thereby reducing the thickness of continents but increasing their surface area.  The form that this ""new land"" takes depends on a number of factors: the age of the continental margin, the shape of the continental shelf, as determined during the rifting process, and the presence or absence of a subduction zone adjacent to the continental margin.     Rifts: The Making of a Continental Margin.  When a new spreading center forms beneath a pre-existing continent, a rift forms that will eventually, if allowed to proceed normally, divide the original continent into two, with new ocean floor being created to separate them.  As the two newly formed plates begin to separate, molten material, mostly basalt, from the mantle beneath will flow upwards into the crack.  The heat from this molten material is conducted to the continental material above, reducing its density and causing it to float higher in the mantle, producing a ridge of mountains above the spreading center.  As spreading continues, blocks will break loose from the sides of the crack and subside into the void, creating the characteristic ""rift valley,"" such as that in East Africa.  As spreading continues, the rift valley will deepen, ultimately subsiding below sea level and allowing ocean water to fill the valley.  The now water-covered subsidence blocks will later become the submerged continental shelves.   Depending on the rate of spreading and the amount of heat flowing into the rift, these continental margins may be broad or narrow.  Also depending on heat flow, which to a large degree depends on the proximity of plumes, volcanoes may or may not form.  Surface fissure flows of basaltic lava may also occur where heat flow is high.  (Plumes generally appear to be associated with the formation of new spreading centers, a notion that will be discussed further in a later lesson.)   Continued spreading causes the complete separation of the two land masses, with new sea floor being created beneath the ever-widening ocean.  As the continental margins move farther from the heat flow at the spreading, the mountains formed along the continental margins cool and slowly subside back into the mantle.  Depending on how much material erosion has removed from their summits, they may sink below the waves and vanish forever.   Freshly rifted continental margins tend to have steep walls, the continental shelves plunging nearly vertically from a few hundred feet deep to the ocean floor, many thousands of feet below.  As erosional sediments are washed off the land surface, they first cover the continental shelves, then wash over the precipice to fall on the ocean floor below.  Very old continental margins, therefore, tend to have large accretionary wedges on the deep ocean floor piled up against the continental margin.   The rifting process is not always as 'clean' as the above description may sound.  Sometimes a segment of spreading center may shift slightly while separation is occurring, causing some of the subsidence blocks to be separated from both daughter continents.  These messy remnants may become submerged plateaus or 'banks' on the sea floor, coral atolls, or islands in their own right.  New Zealand, for example, is a continental fragment left behind after a long forgotten rifting episode.     Passive and Active Margins:  The continental margins discussed in the preceding section are known as passive margins, where the continent and the adjoining ocean floor are part of the same plate.  Passive margins occur on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, in Europe, Africa, and North and South America.  Margins where continent and sea floor are on separate plates, which usually implies a subduction zone adjacent to the continent, are known as active margins.  Active margins occur around much of the Pacific Rim, in North and South America, the Alaska and Kamchatka Peninsulas, the Aleutian Islands, and Japan.   Barring a realignment of plate boundaries, passive continental margins can persist for very long spans of time, building accretionary wedges that can extend hundreds of miles out to sea.  As the wedge of sediments thicken, the thickest portion can eventually rise above sea level, burying the original continental shelves and becoming 'new' dry land.   Sedimentary deposition along active margins is made somewhat more complicated by the presence of a subduction zone offshore.  The rate of sedimentary deposition and the subduction rate, as well as the age of the continental margin, all influence the type of landforms created.  The simplest case, which occurs with very young active margins, is where a range of volcanic mountains form on the leading edge of the continent as material from the subducting oceanic plate is heated and the lighter fractions melt their way up through the overlying continent.  (The oceanic plate is always subducted under the continental plate.)  As the mountains rise, some of the erosional sediments will be washed out to sea, eventually to tumble over the edge of the continental shelf and down into the offshore trench.  A small percentage of these sediments may actually be carried beneath the continent, to contribute to the molten material feeding the volcanoes.  The great majority of the sediments in the trench, however, will be scraped off of the subducting plate, to adhere to the edge of the continent, as will any extraneous material of lower density  previously residing on top of the subducting plate, such as oceanic sediments, seamounts, or even small islands.  As material is added to the continental margin, the added weight further depresses the subducting sea floor, effectively pushing the trench farther out to sea.  The western coastline of South America remains in this state today, the Peru-Chile Trench being responsible for the formation of the Andes Mountains.     Island Arcs and Back-Arc Basins:  When the volume of sediments is great enough relative to the rate of subduction, the trench adjacent to an active continental margin can be overwhelmed by erosional deposits, and simply stop subducting.  Continued convergence of the two plates will cause a new trench to form some distance offshore.  Subduction at the new site will lead to the formation of a volcanic island arc, behind which remains a now passive section of sea floor, known as a back arc basin.  The presence of an offshore subduction can also produce tension on the overriding continent, as subducting material from the oceanic plate entrains mantle material from beneath the continent.  This can lead to rifting and crustal stretching within the back-arc basin.   Continued erosion from the mainland, plus added sediments eroded from the new volcanic islands, will eventually fill the basin up to sea level.  Subsequent sediments from the mainland must then be washed over the now dry land, between the volcanic islands, and out into the trench.   Over a long enough span of time, this process of new island arcs and filled up back arc basins can be repeated many times, as a careful examination of the Pacific margin of the Asian continent will reveal.  The Kamchatka Peninsula, the Kuril Islands, and the Japanese Archipelago are the most recent (and currently active) island arcs, while the Sea of Okhotsk and the Sea of Japan are back arc basins that have not yet filled with sediments.  The Korean Peninsula is a former island arc, as are any number of arc-shaped mountain ranges on the Asian mainland.  The Yellow Sea  is very shallow (less than 600' or 180 m. deep) but not quite completely filled with sediments, while the Amur River and several other Manchurian rivers flow through former back arc basins that are now high and dry.  Manchuria and much of far eastern Siberia, then, are composed of 'new' land created by erosion and island arc formation along a very old active margin.  (An explanation of the distinction between 'new' land and 'old' land (or cratons) will be discussed in a subsequent lesson.)     | Next Lesson:  When Continents Collide  | |  Return to First Page  | |  Earth Sciences Home Page  |                                                          File created on May 3, 1998.
