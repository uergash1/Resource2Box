GX266-65-15359758	Marshall COUNTY  Created at statehood from Pickens County in the Chickasaw Nation, Indian Territory, this smallest county in the state was settled by the Chickasaws beginning in 1837 with the removal from their Eastern homes. A member of the Constitutional Convention, George A. Henshaw of Madill, succeeded in giving the county his mother's maiden name, Marshall. The county seat, Madill, is named for George A. Madill of St. Louis, an attorney for the railroad. Oil has played a colorful part in the county's history. Leases along the Red River led to the Supreme Court's final decision in the boundary dispute with Texas. Principal industries in the county are: Oklahoma Steel and Wire, W.W. Trailer, Clint Williams Texoma Peanut Co., Madill Manufacturing, S & H Trailer, J & I Manufacturing and Contract Manufacturing. Also important are oil, agriculture, livestock and tourism. The Denison Dam, completed in 1944, created Lake Texoma with 91,200 acres of water. This lake attracts some 500,000 visitors annually and has made tourism a major industry in the county. Native son, Raymond D. Gary of Madill, brought the spotlight of attention to the county when he became the 15th Governor of Oklahoma during the years 1955-59.

Clay County had several sewer projects listed in the plan. The plan provided detailed cost estimates involving the construction of new sewer lines. Other cost estimates were obtained from a draft report provided by Kentucky's 5th District Congressman Harold Rogers, entitled Water Resource Related Environmental Initiatives, dated May 28, 1998. The Cumberland Valley Area Development District utilized the chart below, labeled as Table 1 and Table 2, to assist with the determination of costs for items such as STEP, treatment systems, and costs for collection systems.

The decennial census is the only national survey providing consistent, uniform measures and data for every geographic area in the nation. The results capture a picture in time of the population of Utah; who we are, how we've changed, and the direction we are heading- demographically, socially, and economically. Cities and Counties of Utah is the first in a series of Census 2000 Briefs to provide detailed analysis of the Utah Census 2000 data. This report contains tables, figures, and maps showing current and historical population data for Utah's counties, cities, census designated places (CDPs), and reservations. The report begins with a 1990-2000 summary population table for the U.S., Utah, and Utah's counties and cities. This section is followed by more detailed demographic analysis of the state, including data on population density, land area, and growth and size rankings. The last section of the report provides users with a historical look at Utah and the growth that has occurred over the last hundred years. State of Utah Utah's April 1, 2000 population reached 2,233,169. This represents a population increase of 510,319 persons, or 29.6% from 1990, ranking Utah fourth among states in the rate of population growth from 1990 to 2000. Utah grew more than twice as fast as the U.S. (13.2%) during this ten year period. Utah, as well as four of its neighboring states, ranked as the five fastest growing states in the country during the last decade. They include: Nevada (66.3%), Arizona (40.0%), Colorado (30.6%), Utah (29.6%), and Idaho (28.5%). Utah's Counties Largest . Salt Lake County continues to be the state's largest county with a population of 898,387 in 2000, followed by Utah County (368,536), Davis (238,994), Weber (196,533), Cache (91,391), and Washington  (90,354) Counties. Daggett County remains the smallest county in the state with a 2000 population of 921. Three out of every four people in the state live in the northern metropolitan area, including Weber, Davis, Salt Lake, and Utah Counties, where 1,702,450 residents, or 76% of the state's population reside. Fastest Growing. Summit County was the fastest growing county over the decade, nearly doubling in size and increasing 92%, from 15,518 in 1990 to 29,736 in 2000. Seventy percent of the growth occurred in the unincorporated area of the county. Washington and Iron County were the second and third fastest growing counties, respectively, in the state during the 1990s. Washington County, with an 86% increase over the decade, grew at nearly three times the state rate. Iron County, grew more than twice the state rate from 1990-2000, with a 63% increase. Five of the state's fastest growing counties form a ring of high growth around the northern metropolitan counties. These counties include Summit (92%); Tooele (53%); Wasatch (51%); Juab (42%); and Sanpete (40%). Among the other fastest growing counties in the state are Utah (40%); Daggett (34%); and Cache (30%) Counties. Carbon County, with a growth rate of just 1% over the decade, was the slowest growing county in the state. Most Dense. Salt Lake County remains the most densely populated county in the state with 1,218.4 persons per square mile. Other densely populated counties include Davis (784.9); Weber (341.5); Utah (184.4); Cache (78.5); and Washington (37.2). Garfield County is the least dense county in the state with less than one person per square mile. Utah's Cities Largest . Salt Lake City continues to be the largest city in the state with a 2000 population of 181,743, followed by West Valley City (108,896); Provo 2   (105,166); Sandy (88,418); Orem (84,324); Ogden (77,226); West Jordan (68,336); Layton (58,474); Taylorsville (57,439); and St. George (49,663). Fastest Growing. The City of Draper lead the way among the state's fastest growing cities (greater than 9,000). Draper more than tripled in size from 19902000, increasing by 18,000 people, or 248%. Several other of the state's largest cities doubled in size over the decade, including South Jordan (141%); Lehi (125%); Riverton (122%); and Syracuse (102%). Most Dense. Taylorsville is the most densely populated city in the state with 5,376.2 persons per square mile. Other densely populated Utah cities include Midvale (4,627.4); Orem (4,573.6); Washington Terrace (4,477.4); Roy (4,330.8); Sandy (3,961.5); and South Ogden (3,917.1). Howell Town in Box Elder County is the least dense city/town with only 6.2 persons per square mile. Utah's Census Designated Places (CDPs) A CDP is a statistical entity comprising a dense concentration of population that is not within an incorporated place but is locally identified by a name. CDPs are delineated cooperatively with state and local and tribal government officials based on Census Bureau guidelines. For the first time in Census 2000, CDPs do not have to meet a population threshold to qualify for tabulation of census data. Largest . The ten largest census designated places in Utah in 2000 are all located in Salt Lake County. Kearns CDP is the largest with a population of 33,659, followed by Millcreek CDP (30,377); Cottonwood Heights CDP (27,569); Magna CDP (22,770); and East Millcreek CDP (2,385). Fastest Growing. Of those CDPs present in both the 1990 Census and Census 2000, Montezuma Creek CDP had the largest percent change in population over the decade (214.9%). Erda CDP was the second fastest growing CDP, increasing by 127.5%, followed by Stansbury Park CDP (122.1%); Little Cottonwood Creek CDP (43.2%); and Oquirrh CDP (36.8%).  Most Dense. The eleven most densely populated CDPs in the state are located in Salt Lake County. Kearns CDP is the most dense with 6,994.1 persons per square mile, followed by White City CDP (6,912.6); Millcreek CDP (6,160.5); Oquirrh CDP (5,950.3); and Canyon Rim CDP (5,033.6). Historical Population The final section of this report contains historical population tables for the United States, Utah, and Utah's counties and cities. The historical data dates back to 1790 for the nation, 1850 for the state and its counties, and 1890 for cities. Additional Information American FactFinder.

CDPs are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the state in which they are located. The boundaries usually are defined in cooperation with local or tribal officials. These boundaries, which usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or other legal entity boundary, have no legal status, nor do these places have officials elected to serve traditional municipal functions. CDP boundaries may change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary.  *New CDP for Census 2000 Source: U.S. Census Bureau  42   Census Designated Places Ranked by Population Size Size Rank 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 CDP Kearns CDP Millcreek CDP Cottonwood Heights CDP Magna CDP East Millcreek CDP Cottonwood West CDP Canyon Rim CDP Oquirrh CDP Little Cottonwood Creek Valley CDP Mount Olympus CDP *Summit Park CDP White City CDP Hooper CDP *South Snyderville Basin CDP Maeser CDP Erda CDP Stansbury Park CDP Granite CDP Dugway CDP *North Snyderville Basin CDP *Benson CDP *Benjamin CDP *Oljato-Monument Valley CDP *West Mountain CDP *Daniel CDP *Lake Shore CDP *Riverside CDP Fort Duchesne CDP *Aneth CDP *South Willard CDP Neola CDP Montezuma Creek CDP *Palmyra CDP *Spring Lake CDP *Cove CDP *Navajo Mountain CDP Whiterocks CDP *La Sal CDP *Woodland CDP *Bluff CDP *Avon CDP *Timber Lakes CDP *Elberta CDP *White Mesa CDP *Halchita CDP *Peter CDP Randlett CDP *Spanish Valley CDP *Samak CDP *Tselakai Dezza CDP *Halls Crossing CDP Mexican Hat CDP *Garden CDP *Cache CDP County Salt Lake Salt Lake Salt Lake Salt Lake Salt Lake Salt Lake Salt Lake Salt Lake Salt Lake Salt Lake Summit Salt Lake Weber Summit Uintah Tooele Tooele Salt Lake Tooele Summit Cache Utah San Juan Utah Wasatch Utah Box Elder Uintah San Juan Box Elder Duchesne San Juan Utah Utah Cache San Juan Uintah San Juan Summit San Juan Cache Wasatch Utah San Juan San Juan Cache Uintah San Juan Summit San Juan San Juan San Juan Rich Cache 2000 Population 33,659 30,377 27,569 22,770 21,385 18,727 10,428 10,390 7,221 7,103 6,597 5,988 3,926 3,636 2,855 2,473 2,385 2,018 2,016 1,821 1,451 1,029 864 838 770 755 678 621 598 586 533 507 485 469 443 379 341 339 335 320 306 289 278 277 270 230 224 181 161 103 89 88 83 37  *New CDP for Census 2000 Source: U.S. Census Bureau  43   Census Designated Place Comparisons: 1990-2000 1990-2000 Absolute Change -99 -1,197 1,251 239 201 1,386 -6 -1,282 458 5,285 2,179 257 4,941 -200 -1,853 346 -310 -24 2,797 -57 1,311 -518 21 1990-2000 Percent Change -0.9% -4.2% 7.2% 13.4% 0.9% 127.5% -1.0% -38.8% 13.2% 18.6% 43.2% 9.9% 27.7% -69.4% -5.7% 214.9% -4.2% -4.3% 36.8% -20.3% 122.1% -8.0% 6.6% Rank By Absolute Change 17 21 7 11 12 5 14 22 8 1 4 10 2 18 23 9 19 15 3 16 6 20 13 Rank By Percent Change 14 16 11 8 13 2 15 22 9 7 4 10 6 23 19 1 17 18 5 21 3 20 12  Census Designated Place (CDP) Canyon Rim CDP Cottonwood Heights CDP Cottonwood West CDP Dugway CDP East Millcreek CDP Erda CDP Fort Duchesne CDP Granite CDP Hooper CDP Kearns CDP Little Cottonwood Creek Valley CDP Maeser CDP Magna CDP Mexican Hat CDP Millcreek CDP Montezuma Creek CDP Mount Olympus CDP Neola CDP Oquirrh CDP Randlett CDP Stansbury Park CDP White City CDP Whiterocks CDP  County Salt Lake Salt Lake Salt Lake Tooele Salt Lake Tooele Uintah Salt Lake Weber Salt Lake Salt Lake Uintah Salt Lake San Juan Salt Lake San Juan Salt Lake Duchesne Salt Lake Uintah Tooele Salt Lake Uintah  1990 Population 10,527 28,766 17,476 1,777 21,184 1,087 627 3,300 3,468 28,374 5,042 2,598 17,829 288 32,230 161 7,413 557 7,593 281 1,074 6,506 320  2000 Population 10,428 27,569 18,727 2,016 21,385 2,473 621 2,018 3,926 33,659 7,221 2,855 22,770 88 30,377 507 7,103 533 10,390 224 2,385 5,988 341  Note: This comparison includes only those CDPs present in both the 1990 Census and Census 2000.

K-Z         Special Schedules of the Eleventh Census (1890) Enumerating Union Veterans  and Widows of Union Veterans of the Civil War. M123. 118 rolls.    An act of March 1, 1889, provided that the Superintendent of Census in taking    the Eleventh Census should ""cause to be taken on a special schedule of    inquiry, according to such form as he may prescribe, the names, organizations,    and length of service of those who had served in the Army, Navy, or Marine Corps    of the United States in the war of the rebellion, and who are survivors at the    time of said inquiry, and the widows of soldiers, sailors, or marines.""            Each schedule calls for the following information: name of the veteran (or if    he did not survive, the names of both the widow and her deceased husband); the    veteran's rank, company, regiment or vessel, date of enlistment, date of discharge,    and length of service in years, months, and days; post office and address of    each person listed; disability incurred by the veteran; and remarks necessary    to a complete statement of his term of service.

GX257-80-9885247	"Recycle, Ohio!  Special Annual Report Issue March 2000 - Volume VII - Issue 1 Ohio Department of Natural Resources Division of Recycling & Litter Prevention Bob Taft, Governor Sam Speck, Director Mike Canf ield, Chief  COMMUNIQU H ow many times have you read or heard the words, ""closing the loop is important to the success of Ohio's recycling programs?"" The Recycling Market Development Grant program symbolizes the importance of those words. In the past five years, the ODNR Division of Recycling and Litter Prevention has awarded cooperating solid waste management districts and partnering companies more than $3 million. Funds are used for a variety of projects, including research and development, equipment upgrades and purchases, and facility improvements. ""Developing new markets for plastics and other recyclables helps strengthen Ohio's recycling industry,"" said ODNR Director Sam Speck. ""We will continue to work aggressively to create stronger markets for the recycled materials our communities collect."" The Recycling Market Development Grant (RMDG) is a matching grant that enables Ohio companies to invest in initiatives that strengthen local or regional markets for plastic, paper and other recycled materials. The grants have resulted in companies replacing virgin materials with recycled-content feedstock collected from Ohio's recycling programs, and have created new job opportunities locally. The grant program has produced a number of success stories; Custom PlasTech, Ltd. is a recent example of how the RMDG program continues to strengthen recycling markets. Last fall, a $75,000 grant was awarded to the Portage County Solid Waste Management District and Custom PlasTech. According to Custom PlasTech, without the grant, the company wouldn't have been able to use recycled feedstock in their line of highway barricade signs and commercial sandwich board signs. Custom PlasTech officials learned about the grant opportunity when they began plans to relocate their present 10,000 sq. ft. facility in Geauga County to a new site in Portage County. Construction begins on their new 26,000 sq. ft. facility this spring; a building that will hold new equipment purchased with '00 RMDG funds and house employees in new jobs created by that new equipment. Custom PlasTech's line of barricade signs are used by highway and roadway crews to close streets and re-route cars during construction and other projects. These signs use pelletized, natural colored recycled plastic processed by an Ohio firm, milk jugs that were tossed into Ohio recycling bins. With grant funding, the company purchased molds for the new recycled-content products and a vacuum blending system instrumental in maintaining product quality. ""The blender mixes the recycled plastic with the virgin feedstock and guarantees a consistent product, which helps reduce our costs up front. Otherwise, we'd have wild swings in product qualitywe want all good parts,"" said Ron Zab, manager of Custom PlasTech's strategic business unit. ""We were using virgin HDPE plastic in our line of barricades,"" said Zab, Continued on back cover  Improving markets is the key to recycling's success  Marquee  Sentinel 12 Top  Marquee Jr.  Marquee Mini (12)  PMG  Sentinel Mini  Custom PlasTech's line of recycled-content products.  Still Rockin', Still Rollin', Still Recyclin' after 20 years Ohio's recycling, litter prevention and solid waste management professionals will have a chance to sing ""Happy Birthday"" to the Division of Recycling and Litter Prevention (DRLP) at the 20th Anniversar y Conference being held July 16-19 in Cleveland. The conference will feature tours, technical and educational sessions, as well as other professional enrichment opportunities. Reserve your room today by calling the Cleveland Lakeside Holiday Inn at (216) 241-5100. Remember to ask for the DRLP 20th Anniversary Conference  rates are only good until June 24. For more information on the conference, check the division's website at www.dnr.state.oh.us/odnr/recycling/anniversary.htm.   FOCUS ON... Community Success Stories Catching up on DRLP news As winter winds down and thoughts turn to planning spring activities, division staff are finishing up the work required to turn a pile of deserving nomination forms into the annual Take Pride, Ohio! Awards Luncheon on April 6. This year, DRLP will also be honoring individuals, organizations and agencies who have provided successful partnering opportunities for state campaigns and programs. America Recycles Day fever is catching on both nationally and here in the Buckeye state. Thanks to our local participants and sponsoring organizations, Ohio's 1999 ARD campaign results included more than 100 special events, 78 displays and more than 150 print and media advertisements. Best of all, more than 12,000 pledge cards were delivered to ARD headquarters, and those pledge cards will be eligible for the 2000 American Green Dream Home giveaway in December 2000. 2000 ROG Grant Awards As they saythe Recycle, Ohio! grant checks are in the mail! Ninety-eight Ohio counties, cities and solid waste management districts received more than $6.7 million in 2000 Recycle, Ohio! grant (ROG) funding. I'm encouraged by the range and depth of projects coordinated by local recycling and litter prevention programs across the state. A complete listing of ROG awards is opposite this column. As in past years, division staff presented ceremonial checks to a select number of county commissioners. Deputy Chief Tom Davis and I had the honor to share the successes of our grant programs with local elected officials. I think it is important that all Ohioans, citizens and local officials alike, recognize the hard work of our talented, hands-on and committed recycling and litter prevention professionalsthe backbone of Ohio's recycling and litter prevention programs. Sincerely,  2000 Recycle, Ohio! Grant Awards  N  ow in its twentieth year of funding local recycling and litter prevention programs, the division awarded a total of $6,782,843 in Recycle, Ohio! grant funding to 98 Ohio communities, county governments and regional solid waste management districts. ""These grants help encourage recycling programs across Ohio, allowing local communities to provide recycling services at the neighborhood level,"" Governor Bob Taft said. ""Recycle, Ohio! grants have a positive affect on all Ohioans, helping improve curbside recycling programs and community litter clean-up efforts.""  2000 Recycle, Ohio!

Deadline to submit Recycling Market Development Grant applications to DRLP. Ohio companies are encouraged to contact their local solid waste management district or DRLP for more information.  Improving Markets, continued from page 1 ""Using recycled-content HDPE made sense; we're cutting down on landfill space and we're reusing the materials rather than throwing them out."" And according to Zab, the environmental benefits of using recycledcontent feedstock had another important anglecost savings of 30 percent. Currently, Custom PlasTech is using 10 percent recycled-content and Zab says the company is experimenting with the plastic blend to further increase the recycled-content percentage. ""The investment of grant dollars overall helped the company. We currently employ 10 people in a facility that is busting at the seams,"" said Zab. ""At the new facility we'll be purchasing new molding machinery (for their newest product made from recycled-contenta commercial plastic signboard) that will immediately employ six more people."" For companies like Custom PlasTech, and the other two dozen companies that have participated in the Recycling Market Development Grant program, the grant dollars made an environmental and economic difference.

GX266-95-11813340	"STATE OF TENNESSEE HOUSING RESOURCE DIRECTORY  COMPILED BY THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION, DIVISION OF MENTAL RETARDATION SERVICES 2002  1   HOUSING RESOURCE DIRECTORY INTRODUCTION  In order to support various housing options and resources, the Tennessee Division of Mental Retardation Services (DMRS), in partnership with the Tennessee Housing Development Agency, TN Fair Housing Council, West TN Legal Services, U.S. Dept of Agriculture - Office of Housing and Rural Development, TN Disability Information & Referral Office, John F. Kennedy Center at Vanderbilt University, The Arc of TN, Council for Developmental Disabilities, Peggy and Jo Davis, TN Disability Coalition, People First of TN, and TN Network for Community Economic Development have developed this Housing Resource Directory. The directory will cover a wide variety of topics such as rental assistance, the Tennessee Home of your Own Program, housing grants to non-profits, as well as providing a wide array of pointers on issues such as housing laws and accessibility resources. The directory will point you in the right direction and help you begin to understand how housing support options work here in Tennessee. While our goal is to get people, all people, whether people receiving support services, parents, advocates, providers, community business owners, etc. thinking about how to support people with disabilities to have control of their housing and to purchase their own homes, this directory is not guaranteed to lead to homeownership. The goal of this directory is to provide resources to help people move through the housing and homeownership system, sort out and understand the unique language of the housing/ownership community, and provide an overall outline of the process and procedures that must be followed in order to use the housing and homeownership programs. Where we live is an issue important to all people. We all want a place to call our own. Our very own castle and isle of refuge in a world so fast paced that the pool of information is doubling every 2 to 3 years. This desire, to have a home, is not alien to the life experience of people with disabilities. ""People with disabilities want a place that they can call their own. In this regard, their dreams are no different from their fellow citizens. Many people with disabilities, however, also need supports in order to enjoy everyday community living. For these individuals, having a home of their own frequently is intertwined with the availability of natural, community and public supports to help address their needs"" (Gary Smith, national strategist and advocate). ""Person-owned/controlled housing and personalized support have become part of this nation's agenda as grassroots efforts have challenged the standard way of providing services for people with developmental and other disabilities. Throughout the nation individuals, advocates and innovative service providers have made significant moves from institutions and group homes to the creation of housing and support that permit all people, including those with the most intensive support needs, to live in homes of their choosing"" (Home of Your Own Alliance Brochure).

Section 8 Rental Assistance The Tennessee Housing Development Agency (THDA) is the lead state agency for affordable housing. It serves Tennesseans with low to moderate income who are elderly and/or have a disability. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the State of Tennessee fund THDA programs. There is often a waiting list for services but persons with disabilities are often offered a priority for rental assistance. Agencies that administer Section 8 are listed below.

Frequently Asked Questions about the Section 8 Program What is the Section 8 Program? The Section 8 tenant-based program is a rental assistance (voucher) program that is funded by the Federal Government through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The purpose of the Section 8 Program is to enable eligible families or individuals to obtain decent, safe and sanitary housing by paying a portion of rental costs (including utilities) for the families directly to their landlord. Thirty percent of a person's income is utilized for rent. The HUD Voucher pays the rest. Who is eligible to receive a Housing Choice Voucher? Both families and individuals may be eligible for the Program. Eligibility is primarily based on income and family composition. There may be a waiting list for rental vouchers, but individuals are encouraged to apply even if there is. Most offices prioritize individuals with disabilities on the waiting list. To apply, call the office covering the county where the individual resides.  What is a Housing Choice Voucher? In October, 1999, the certificate and voucher programs merged into a single rental assistance program, the housing choice voucher program.  Where may I live with a Housing Choice Voucher? In the Section 8 Program, you select a unit of your choice, as long as it meets the criteria. If you apply for the waiting list in a county where you do not reside at the time of your application, you must lease a unit in the county where you applied for one-year of your application before you are eligible to relocate with continued assistance to a different Co  8   If I find a landlord not signed up with Section 8, what can I do? The landlord can call the same office to apply as a landlord. Once approved, then the applicant can live there.  How do I Apply for the Program? You must apply with the agency that administers the Program in the county where you desire to live.

All copies of this publication must include the cover page and acknowledgements section before redistribution.  B. Working With Public Housing Agencies Guide for Advocates or Agencies       First identify the agency with Section 8 jurisdiction of your county, a local PHA or TN Housing Development Agency field Office. Identify the agency accessing federal HOME grants. Get an appointment with the director of the agency to establish a relationship. Questions to ask: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. Is the waiting list open? If not. How long has it been closed? Does the PHA give preference to those with disabilities? Does the PHA have an Olmstead Plan? (See page for further information, ""Olmstead Decision) Has the PHA asked HUD for additional Section 8 vouchers, specifically for those with disabilities or specifically those waiting to leave institutional settings to prevent institutionalization? Has the PHA looked at implementing Section 8 voucher use for home ownership/mortgages as now allowed by HUD?  9     Other Information to Know or Ask: 1. On individual cases where a person (Section 8 approved) can't find a Section 8 approved home/apartment that is under that area what can you do? Fair Market can be asked for an exception to: use housing with a higher rent based on reasonable accommodation needs, or an extra bedroom is needed for a live-in companion/couple. 2. Agencies that own homes can apply for a home to be Section 8 approved just like any other landlord can. 3. Section 8 vouchers are now choice based. Although some are available in ""project developments,"" once a person is approved for Section 8, they can choose any place that will consider being approved to take Section 8 and involves a simple inspection that the local PHA or THDA office would do. There is a landlord application and yes the rent must fall within HUD fair market, although again a request from the person receiving a voucher can request an exception if there are specific reasons due to disability is needed.  10   II.

One Family's Perspective of the Home of Your Own Program       Attend home ownership classes with the individual in the area where the home is sought. If your family member is not able to attend, you can attend for them. Contact the TNCED office TNCED2@aol.com phone: (615) 226-8868, in Nashville. Their information and guidance is invaluable. Apply for a TNCED assistance in locating down payment and closing costs. The tenant rent will subsidize the buyer's mortgage payment and in effect increase his or her purchasing power. Contact the financial institution of your choice that issues home mortgages and obtain loan pre-approval. The mortgage company will establish the price range of the home your individual can afford.  If the home is going to be a shared ownership the mortgage company will need financial information on all prospective owners. The individuals will pool their income to get their loan approval. If the home is to be owned by one person with others leasing, you will have to have a signed lease listing all shared expenses such as: The leaseholder (housemate) will be responsible for one-half of the cost of the house note, utilities, yard maintenance, trash pickup, food, etc. (List all shared expenses--have a clear understanding and documentation of what the housemate is obligated to pay.  Check with the Division of Mental Retardation attorney to verify the currency and accuracy of your conservatorship. Some conservators are only guardians over health and well-being. If this is the case, the state attorney can petition the court for a one-time transaction approval for the purchase of the home, when the court agrees that this purchase is in the best interest of your ward. There is no financial obligation for any one other than the owner/s of the home. A conservator is not liable for the mortgage or expenses. The state attorney will need to provide the court with a copy of the real estate appraisal, a copy of the sales contract, and a copy of the good faith estimate of closing costs. These  16   documents provide the court the specifics of the mortgage transaction and prove that the transaction is in your ward's best interest. If the court agrees, a court order will be issued allowing you to make this one-time transaction on behalf of your ward. This process assures there is no financial responsibility or obligation to you as conservator and allows your ward to purchase a home in their name. Since the home is in their name, they cannot be evicted if a change to a different provider agency is required. The correct wording the conservator uses when signing the closing documents is extremely important. Ask the DMRS' Conservator attorney to provide you with the correct phrasing to be used when you sign each document at the closing. In our case we were instructed to sign the closing papers as follows: ""Conservator or Guardian's Name/s, Conservator for, Ward's Name as Pursuant to Court Authority"". The state attorney will walk you through this process and your handicapped individual will be able to purchase a home in their name free from any financial responsibility to their family. MR individuals are unique and do not have to have all of their rights taken away. They simply need extra supervision. If the conservator is over all aspects of their ward's life including financial, the conservator can allow their ward to purchase their home. As conservator, you do not have any obligation to use any of your personal funds. It is totally the buyer's (ward's) responsibility.  If the individual is under 65 years of age, you can establish a ""Special Needs Fund"" to help pay for future maintenance on the home. The fund can only be used for the purpose for which it is established. Check with your caseworker at the Dept. of Human Services before establishing any fund. After 65 years of age all special needs funds are frozen. They are retained for the purpose for which they were established, but you can no longer contribute to it after age 65. Any contributions made after 65 years of age are considered assets and will be counted in the ward's assets. The importance of checking with your Dept. of Human Services caseworker before establishing any funds cannot be stressed enough. If your ward has more than $2000 in assets, they will lose their Medicaid eligibility funding. Written from personal experiences by Peggy and Jo Davis  17   E. Home buyer Education Classes  Tennessee Homebuyer's Education Trainers: A lot of thinking and planning is necessary for a successful home buying experience. Many lenders, real estate professionals and not-for-profit organizations offer homebuyers education classes to help you make your plans. Topics include different kinds of mortgages, down payment requirements, underwriting criteria, and special programs that exist to encourage homeownership with reduced costs. Tennessee Housing Development Agency maintains a list of trainers approved to teach homebuyers about a home. Some classes are free while others may charge a nominal fee. If interested in a homebuyer education class in your county, a complete listing by county is on the following web site: www.state.tn.us/thda/Programs/Mortgage/trainers. In most counties the Agricultural Extension Service offers this class.  F. Legal Assistance/Special Needs Trust   A special needs trust is a trust account that can be set up for a specific reason at a local bank that will not affect benefits. Reasons regarding housing may include an account for house maintenance or to save for a home. A Special Needs Trust is a specific type of trust established with the assets of a disabled individual which meets the following conditions: The trust is established solely for the benefit of a disabled individual by a parent, grandparent, legal guardian, or by a court: AND the trust must stipulate that any remaining amounts in the trust not retained by the trust, upon the beneficiary's death, are to be paid to the State in an amount equal to the total medical assistance paid on the beneficiary's behalf by the State. This type of Special Needs Trust is not a countable resource and would not effect the eligibility of the individual in terms of the resource limit. Disbursements from the trust will be counted as income to the individual in the month of the disbursement unless the disbursement is made to a third party for items that are not food, clothing, or shelter. In other words, if money is paid out to the individual from the trust, that money will count as income in the month. If money is paid out to a provider or other source for anything that is not considered to be food, clothing, or shelter, then the money is not countable as income. Depending on the payment and disbursement, the money paid out could effect eligibility.

Exclusion of Home Ownership on Social Security Benefits Exclusion of TN Home of Your Own as Countable Resource from Federal Register    Your home is not counted regardless of its value. If an individual moves out of his or her home without the intent to return, the home becomes a countable resource because it is no longer the individual's principal place of residence. If an individual leaves his or her home to live in an institution, we still consider the home to be the individual's principal place of residence, irrespective of the individual's intent to return, as long as a spouse or dependent relative of the eligible individual continues to live there. The individual's equity in the former home becomes a countable resource effective with the first day of the month following the month it is no longer his or her principal place of residence. Proceeds from the sale of a home which is excluded from the individual's resources will also be excluded from resources to the extent they are intended to be used and are, in fact, used to purchase another home, which is similarly excluded, within 3 months of the date of receipt of the proceeds. Other proceeds from the sale of the former home are excluded resources if they are used within 3 months of receipt to make payment on the replacement home. Such proceeds, which consist of the down payment and that portion of any installment amount constituting payment against the principal, represent a conversion of a resource. Failure to purchase another home in 3 months, the value of a promissory note or similar installment sales contract received from the sale of a home is a countable resource effective with the first moment of the month following the month the note is executed.

Division of Mental Retardation Services Family Support The Family Support Program is administered by the Division of Mental Retardation Services through contracts with community agencies across the state. The program assists individuals with severe or developmental disabilities and their families to stay together in their homes and communities. It helps families purchase services, supplies, and equipment; however, this program does not reimburse you for costs that are covered under other programs, including Medicaid Waiver, TennCare, Medicare, or private insurance. It is not a substitute for comprehensive long-term services. To     be eligible, you must: Be a fulltime resident at time of application and when services are delivered. Have a severe or developmental disability which is likely to continue indefinitely. Have a disability that results in substantial functional limitations in three or more areas of life function. Reside in a home, alone or with a parent, relative, or other caregiver in the community in an unsupported setting. (A supported setting is a residential setting that is state or federally funded, e.g., institutions, group homes, supported living or state funded foster homes). Individuals who live in subsidized housing (Section 8) or boarding homes are eligible because the living situation is not a ""residential service"" and does not include supportive services.  Many families may be eligible for the Family Support Program, but may not actually receive services, based on funds available, selection criteria, and other factors.

E. Olmstead Decision  The Olmstead Decision  What is it? On June 22, 1999, the United States Supreme Court decided in Olmstead vs. L.C. to support the Americans with Disabilities Act ""Integration Mandate"", which declares that the unnecessary segregation of individuals with disabilities in institutions may constitute discrimination based on disability. The court ruled that the Americans with Disabilities Act may require states to provide communitybased services rather than institutional placements for individuals with disabilities. The decision is a victory in several ways:  44   1. 2. 3.  It upholds the United States Department of Justice's regulations, which mandate that a state must administer its programs in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of individuals with disabilities; It states that unjustified isolation is properly regarded as discrimination on the basis of disability under the ADA; and It recognizes that the United States Congress intended the ADA to step up earlier efforts in the Developmental Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act to secure community living opportunities for people with disabilities. Olmstead affects all people with a current or previous disability or who are regarded as having a disability that substantially limits one or more major life activities. This includes people who currently reside in institutions, including nursing homes, and individuals at risk of institutionalization. All states, including Tennessee, are mandated to provide community settings for individuals who would otherwise be entitled to institutional services when:   Community placement is determined to be appropriate by the state's treatment professionals,  The individual does not oppose community placement, and  Community placement can be reasonably accommodated, taking into account available resources and the needs of others receiving disability services. Lastly, the Olmstead Decision is also important for what it does not say:      It It It It It does does does does does not not not not not say say say say say that all institutions must be closed. when community services must be available. that lack of resources alone is a valid excuse for failure to move qualified individuals into the community. the state's responsibility is limitless. that modification must be made which would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program or activity.  45   VI. Housing Grants to NonProfits A. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) B. Lending Resources for Non-profits  46   A. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is the Federal agency responsible for national policy and programs that address America's housing needs, that improve and develop the nation's communities, and that enforce fair housing laws. Several programs funded by HUD and administered by state and local housing agencies include the following:  Public Housing - Low-income housing, operated by your local housing authority  Section 8 - Tenant based subsidized housing in which the housing authority gives the tenant a certificate or voucher that says the government will subsidize your rent payments and then the tenant finds his/her own housing  FHA Mortgage Insurance Program - A mortgage financing program through FHA, a division of HUD    The Section 811 program provides grants to non-profit organizations to develop and construct or rehabilitate rental housing with support services for very low-income persons with disabilities. Mainstream Program awards funding for Section 8 rental vouchers and certificates to very low-income families whose head or spouse is a person with a disability. The Section 811 program allows persons with disabilities to live independently increasing the supply of rental housing with supportive services and related facilities. The program also allows the sponsor to get project rental assistance which can cover any part of the HUD-approved operating costs of the family that is not met from project income. The Section 811 program grants interest-free capital advances for non-profit sponsors to help finance the development of rental housing with supported services for persons with disabilities. The capital advance can finance the construction or rehabilitation of supportive housing. The advance is interest free and does not have to be repaid as long as the housing remains available for low-income persons with disabilities for at least 40 years. The program also provides project rental assistance; this covers the difference between the HUD-approved operating cost per unit and the amount the individual pays--usually 30 percent of adjusted income.      47     Eligible Customers include persons between the ages of 18 and 62 who have disabilities and are very low-income. The term ""disabled family"" may include two persons with disabilities living together and one or more persons with disabilities living with one or more live-in aides. Availability of funds is published in the Federal Register once a year announcing the allocation of 811 funds to HUD Field Offices usually May is the deadline for applications.

Services include assistance with public school placement, enrollment; referrals for social and health services. Tutoring and extended outreach services available in some areas)  The Child Care Program is located at Christ the King Lutheran Church and is made available during the day to families using the IOS shelter. This enables parents to seek employment and housing with the comfort of knowing that their children are in a safe, stable, and nurturing atmosphere. Caring for and about children is one of the most critical steps in stopping the cycle of homelessness. Child care volunteers are needed to carry out this ministry to children, bringing hope and help where often there is none.

Different agencies receive different kinds of funds; some funds allow a choice of activities. Among the assistance provided by some community action programs are weatherization, energy assistance, housing rehabilitation programs, minor home repair, housing counseling, and emergency housing assistance, as well as programs for job training and emergency food.

Services offered by some shelters are sometimes very basic. Other shelters provide several services: counseling, help in finding employment, medical care, and other assistance. Because there are different resources and different needs for the homeless throughout the state, communities approach the problem in various ways. Some emphasize providing shelters, some issue vouchers to pay for persons to stay in inexpensive hotels, and some provide a combination of resources. This chapter lists emergency providers and shelter facilities within the county. The following agencies are knowledgeable about funds available in the community for emergency shelter.

OHCS uses a system of subgrantee agencies to determine eligibility. Once a home is scheduled for weatherization, the applicant is contacted and an energy audit is scheduled. The energy audit determines the appropriate measures to be initiated based on the existing condition of the home and the funds available. Services provided may include: ceiling, wall, and floor insulation; energy related minor home repairs; energy conservation education; infiltration reduction; as well as furnace repair and replacement. Completed work is inspected by the local agency to ensure compliance with program standards.  Oregon Department of Energy Oregon Department of Energy 625 Marion St NE Ste 1 Salem OR 97301-3742 email: energy.in.internet@state.or.us website: www.energy.state.or.us 503.378.4040 or 800.221.8035 All electric and gas utilities in Oregon are required to provide free energy audits for both owneroccupied and renter- occupied buildings. Interested persons should call the utility that provides their heat to arrange an audit. The utility will provide an energy analysis of the home and will make recommendations for cost-effective energy conservation measures. Because companies that provide oil, propane, butane, or kerosene heat are generally too small to provide energy audits, the Oregon Department of Energy (ODOE) State Home Oil Weatherization Program provides energy audits. Persons with these heat sources should contact ODOE for their energy audit. Homes that are heated primarily with wood can obtain free energy audits from their local electric utility. Owners of owner-occupied or renter-occupied homes that use these heating sources can receive 6.5 percent interest rate loans through private lenders. ODOE can provide a list of available lenders. Low and moderate income renters or owners can receive rebates for up to half the cost of the weatherization. The weatherization must be approved by ODOE for this rebate before the work takes place. The maximum rebate amount is $600.  Energy Rated Homes of Oregon (ERHO) A home energy rating is a measure of a home's overall energy efficiency. The energy efficiency is calculated by collecting data on the performance of various systems within the house, such as the air flow into and out of the house, insulation levels, and the mechanical equipment. This information is then analyzed to determine how efficiently the ""systems"" within the house are working and what improvements would make them work better. The house is then assigned an overall rating and the person requesting the rating is given a report listing the suggested improvements and an estimate of how much money can be saved on energy by making the improvements. For more information, please call toll-free 888.986.ERHO (3746), or visit the department's website at www.hcs.state.or.us.  Low Income Energy Assistance Program The Low Income Energy Assistance Program is a federally funded program through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and is not an entitlement program. The Low Income Energy Assistance Program is a program designed to help low income households with home heating costs. Eligible households include any whose income is at or below 60 percent of statewide median income. Poverty levels are based on household income and household size. To be eligible, the households must have documented energy costs. Both homeowner and renter households are eligible. Applications are made through a local Community Action Agency or a local senior service agency.  Low Income Weatherization Programs The Low Income Weatherization Program provides weatherization and energy conservation services at no cost to households below 60 percent of statewide median income. Major funding for the program is from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) with other funds from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, utility companies and the Bonneville Power Administration. The waiting period varies with each local agency depending on the need in the area. Households with  January 2001  19   Weatherization for Owner-Occupied or Renter-Occupied Dwelling Units Owners of owner-occupied or renter-occupied homes may be eligible for weatherization loans and grants from the utility that provides their heat. These programs vary according to the source of funds available to provide this assistance. Unless otherwise specified, these programs are not based upon income. The loan and grant amount for weatherization is generally based upon the cost of providing recommended measures.

Oregon Food Bank The Oregon Food Bank (OFB) is a private, not-for-profit organization dedicated to fighting hunger and its root causes. Food from a variety of sources moves through warehouses to a network of eighteen regional food banks across Oregon. Eighteen are independent charitable organizations.

The Oregon Food Bank Network links a total of 650 hunger-relief agencies in an alliance against hunger. Together, they help more than half a million people each year. In addition to providing food, the Oregon Food Bank supports the members of the network with technical assistance for fundraising, food resource development, food drives, volunteer programs, and more.

They are the major source of housing assistance in Oregon. Local housing authorities give up-to-date information on eligibility requirements. Demand is great and waiting lists are usually long, sometimes requiring extended waiting periods. Housing Authorities offer three main programs: Public housing is owned by housing authorities and is rented to persons earning no more than 50 percent of area median income. The renter pays no more than 30 percent of household income for rent and utilities. The housing authority pays the balance of the rent with federally provided funds. The rules of occupancy are set out by the housing authority in a lease. Section 8 Certificate/Voucher Program in which the eligible renter (income no more than 50 percent of median) finds a housing unit on the open market and asks the landlord to participate in the Section 8 program. The housing authority inspects the unit to insure it is decent and safe. Under the Certificate program, the renter pays no more than 30 percent of household income for rent and utilities. Under the Voucher program, the renter pays no more than 40 percent of household income for rent and utilities. The housing authority pays the balance of the rent from federally provided funds. Rules of occupancy are determined by the landlord in a lease. Housing owned by some housing authorities is available to households earning between 50 percent and 80 percent of median income. This housing is a bit more costly in monthly rents than public housing or Section 8, but it will usually be less expensive than market rate. In addition to these programs, some housing authorities provide emergency rent assistance and/or security deposits to eligible applicants.

The number of parks across Oregon has increased to approximately 1500 with over 63,000 spaces. One thing hasn't changed: Owning a home and renting the land it's placed on still presents some unique challenges. To address these challenges, the 1989 Oregon State Legislature created the Manufactured Dwelling Park Ombudsman Program, or MDPO. The Program has three main purposes, the first of which is to assist park owners and residents in resolving concerns associated with their parks and living situations through informal dispute resolution, and to engage in activities that lead to improvements in manufactured dwelling park relationships. The second is to provide general and technical information about Oregon law as it pertains to manufactured dwelling park communities, and information about resources available that might assist in the voluntary resolution of disputes. The last is to gather information for legislators, the public and others about manufactured dwelling park living. The MDPO Program:  publishes a park directory annually, which includes the park name, address, approximate number of park spaces, and a contact representative  provides copies of the Oregon Landlord Tenant Law upon request ...and can help you:  communicate  clarify the facts in your situation  know and understand your agreement  understand your rights and responsibilities  arrange and facilitate meetings  connect with other appropriate resources Call the number below to request your copy of ORS Chapter 90 Landlord Tenant Law, the Oregon State Park Directory, or for other assistance.

The department administers the Program through local public service agencies (PSAs) which consist of either a housing authority or a community action agency (please see those chapters for contact information). The PSA administers the program in its service area. To qualify, a household consisting of an individual or group of individuals, must be very low income, i.e., cannot have a total gross household income from all sources (not including income from the employment of children under the age of 18) that exceeds 50 percent of the area median income for that household size. A qualifying household is eligible to receive a LIRHF grant covering up to six months' rental housing expenses.  Tenant-Based Rental Assistance This program offers up to two (2) years of rental assistance to qualified very low income tenants and is provided through local Public Service Agencies established through the department's Low Income Rental Housing Assistance (LIRHF) Program. A grant may cover rent payments plus any reasonable refundable security deposit. (Please see the Housing Authority and Community Action chapters for current contact information.)  Emergency Housing Account The Oregon Legislature established this account to assist persons who are homeless or at-risk of becoming homeless, especially those who are over 65 years of age, disabled, farmworkers, or Native Americans. Designated Lead Agencies coordinate the use of these funds through an inclusive community planning process. The funds may pay for emergency shelter and attendant services, housing services designed to transition households from homelessness to permanent housing and economic independence, supportive housing services designed to enable individuals to continue living in their own homes, or programs that provide emergency payment of mortgage, rent, or utilities obligations.

An act of March 1, 1889, provided that the Superintendent of Census in taking    the Eleventh Census should ""cause to be taken on a special schedule of    inquiry, according to such form as he may prescribe, the names, organizations,    and length of service of those who had served in the Army, Navy, or Marine Corps    of the United States in the war of the rebellion, and who are survivors at the    time of said inquiry, and the widows of soldiers, sailors, or marines.""            Each schedule calls for the following information: name of the veteran (or if    he did not survive, the names of both the widow and her deceased husband); the    veteran's rank, company, regiment or vessel, date of enlistment, date of discharge,    and length of service in years, months, and days; post office and address of    each person listed; disability incurred by the veteran; and remarks necessary    to a complete statement of his term of service.

K-Z         Special Schedules of the Eleventh Census (1890) Enumerating Union Veterans  and Widows of Union Veterans of the Civil War. M123. 118 rolls.    An act of March 1, 1889, provided that the Superintendent of Census in taking    the Eleventh Census should ""cause to be taken on a special schedule of    inquiry, according to such form as he may prescribe, the names, organizations,    and length of service of those who had served in the Army, Navy, or Marine Corps    of the United States in the war of the rebellion, and who are survivors at the    time of said inquiry, and the widows of soldiers, sailors, or marines.""            Each schedule calls for the following information: name of the veteran (or if    he did not survive, the names of both the widow and her deceased husband); the    veteran's rank, company, regiment or vessel, date of enlistment, date of discharge,    and length of service in years, months, and days; post office and address of    each person listed; disability incurred by the veteran; and remarks necessary    to a complete statement of his term of service.          Practically all of the schedules for the States Alabama through Kansas and    approximately half of those for Kentucky appear to have been destroyed, possibly    by fire, before the transfer of the remaining schedules to the National Archives    in 1943.

GX263-36-11530340	"Missouri Country Adventures 2002 Agritourism Guide   Welcome to the 2002 Missouri Agritourism Directory. On these pages you will find a wealth of information on one of Missouri's most valuable assets. Agriculture has always been the heart of the social values that make Missouri such a great place to live. In fact, at one time most Missourians were raised on farms or in small rural communities. Although most citizens now have a lifestyle outside the agriculture industry, all Missourians can enjoy the experience and benefits of farm life through agritourism. Agritourism can be defined as rural, farm-based destinations designed for the enjoyment and education of the public. Many Missouri farm businesses have opened their gates to visitors, proudly welcoming the public to share the experience. Families can enjoy a variety of quality time together in rural Missouri, whether choosing the perfect Christmas tree, spending an afternoon fishing, or enjoying an educational tour. Other options include staying at a farm bed and breakfast, navigating a corn maze, or taking in some of the many local fairs and festivals. I encourage you to ""Come out to the Country"" and experience the fun, excitement and hospitality that can only be found in rural Missouri.

The table finding guide lists the geographic areas and the subjects shown in this report. To determine which tables in this report show data for a particular topic, find the subject in the column headings at the top of the table finding guide and then look down the left-hand column for the desired type of geographic area. Below is an example of a table finding guide.  INTRODUCTION Data from the 1990 census are presented in several different report series. These series are published under the following three subject titles: 1. 1990 Census of Population (1990 CP) 2. 1990 Census of Housing (1990 CH) 3. 1990 Census of Population and Housing (1990 CPH) The types of data and the geographic areas shown in reports differ from one series to another. In most series, there is one report for each State, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands of the United States (Virgin Islands), plus a United States summary report. Some series include reports for American Indian and Alaska Native areas, metropolitan areas, and urbanized areas. See appendix F for detailed information about the various report series; additional 1990 census data products such as computer tapes, microfiche, and laser disks; other related materials; and sources of assistance. The data from the 1990 census were derived from a limited number of basic questions asked of the entire population and about every housing unit (referred to as the 100-percent questions), and from additional questions asked of a sample of the population and housing units (referred to as the sample questions). Two primary versions of questionnaires were used: a short form containing only the 100-percent questions and a long form containing both the 100-percent questions and the additional sample questions. Appendix E presents facsimiles of the questionnaire pages and the respondent instructions used to collect the data included in this report. Appendix F lists the subjects that are covered by the 100-percent and sample components of the 1990 census. Legal provision for this census, which was conducted as of April 1, 1990, was made in the Act of Congress of August 31, 1954 (amended August 1957, December 1975, and October 1976), which is codified in Title 13, United States Code.

Each table includes four major parts: (1) heading, (2) boxhead, (3) stub, and (4) data field. A typical census report table is illustrated below.  The stub is located at the left edge of the table. It includes a listing of line or row captions or descriptions. At the top of the stub is the stubhead. The stubhead is considered to be an extension of the table title and usually shows generic geographic area designations and restrictions. In the stub, several features are used to help the user better understand the contents of the table. Usually, a block of data lines is preceded by a sidehead. The sidehead, similar to a spanner, describes and classifies the stub entries following it. The use of indentation in a stub indicates the relationship of one data line to another. Indented data lines represent subcategories that in most instances, sum to a total. Occasionally in tables, it is desirable to show one or more single-line subcategories that do not sum to the total. The unit of measure, such as dollars, is shown when it is not clear from the general wording of the data line. The data field is that part of the table that contains the data. It extends from the bottom of the boxhead to the bottom of the table and from the right of the stub to the right-hand edge of the page. Both geographic and subject-matter terms appear in tables. It is important to read the definitions of the terms used in the tables because census terms often are defined in special ways that reflect the manner in which the questions were asked and the data were tabulated. Definitions of geographic terms are provided in appendix A. Subject-matter terms are defined in appendix B.  Symbols and Geographic Abbreviations The following symbols are used in the tables and explanations of subjects covered in this report:  A dash ` ` ' ' represents zero or a figure or percent that rounds to less than 0.1.  Three dots ` ` ...' ' mean not applicable.  (NA) means not available. The heading consists of the table number, title, and headnote. The table number indicates the position of the table within the report, while the title is a brief statement indicating the classification, nature, and time reference of the data presented in the table. The headnote is enclosed in brackets and is located under the title. It contains statements that qualify, explain, or provide information pertaining to the entire table. The boxhead is under the heading. This portion of the table, which contains the individual column heads or captions, describes the data in each vertical column. In the boxhead of many tables, a spanner appears across and above two or more column heads or across two or more lower spanners. The purpose of a spanner is to classify or qualify items below it or separate the table into identifiable blocks in terms of major aspects of the data. I2  The prefix ` ` r' ' indicates that the count has been revised since publication of 1980 reports or that the area was erroneously omitted or not shown in the correct geographic relationship in the 1980 census reports. This symbol appears only in the 1990 CPH-2, Population and Housing Unit Counts reports.  A dagger ` ` ' ' next to the name of a geographic area indicates that there has been a geographic change(s) (for example, an annexation or detachment, a new incorporation, or a name change) since the information published for the 1980 census for that area. This symbol appears only in the 1990 CPH-2, Population and Housing Unit Counts reports. The geographic change information for the entities in a State is shown in the ` ` User Notes' ' section of the 1990 CPH-2, Population and HOW TO USE THIS CENSUS REPORT   JOBNAME: No Job Name PAGE: 3 SESS: 50 OUTPUT: Tue Nov 17 09:48:18 1992 / node2/ F main F / 90dec/ cph2/ usst/ how  Housing Unit Counts report, for that State. The information for all States appears in the ` ` User Notes' ' section of the technical documentation for Summary Tape Files 1 and 3.  A plus sign ``+ '' or a minus sign ``'' following a figure denotes that the median falls in the initial or terminal category of an open-ended distribution. (For more information on medians, see the discussion under ` ` Derived Measures' ' in appendix B.)  A minus sign ` ` ' ' preceding a figure denotes decrease. The following geographic abbreviations are used in the tables and explanations of subjects covered in this report:  A ` ` (pt.)' ' next to the name of a geographic area in a hierarchical presentation indicates that the geographic entity is only partially located in the superior geographic entity. For example, a ` ` (pt.)' ' next to a place name in a county subdivision-place hierarchy indicates that the place is located in more than one county subdivision. (Places also may be ` ` split' ' by county, congressional district, urban/ rural, metropolitan area, voting district, and other geographic boundaries, depending on the presentation.) Other geographic entities also can be``split'' by a higher-level entity. The exception is a tabulation block, which is unique within all geographic entities in census products.  BG is block group.  BNA is block numbering area.  CDP is census designated place.  CMSA is consolidated metropolitan statistical area.  MA is metropolitan area.  MSA is metropolitan statistical area.  PMSA is primary metropolitan statistical area.  TDSA is tribal designated statistical area.  TJSA is tribal jurisdiction statistical area.  unorg. is unorganized territory.  VTD is voting district. Census tables often include derived measures such as medians, means, percents, and ratios. More detailed information about derived measures is provided in appendix B.  USER NOTES User notes include corrections, errata, and related explanatory information. This section appears directly before the statistical tables in census reports unless graphics are shown. It presents information about unique characteristics of the report and changes or corrections made too late to be reflected in the text or tables themselves.  CONTENTS OF THE APPENDI X ES Appendix A--Provides definitions of the types of geographic areas and related information used in census reports. Appendix B--Contains definitions for the subject-matter items used in census reports, including explanations of derived measures, limitations of the data, and comparability with previous censuses. The subjects are listed alphabetically. In reports that contain both population and housing characteristics, the population characteristics are described first, followed by the explanations of the housing subjects. Appendix C--Provides information on confidentiality of the data, allocations and substitutions, and sources of errors in the data. Appendix D--Explains the residence rules used in counting the population and housing units, presents a brief overview of data collection operations, and describes processing procedures used to convert data from unedited questionnaires to final 1990 publications and tapes. This appendix also clarifies the procedures used to collect data for persons abroad at the time of the census, where persons on military bases or away at school were counted, how data were collected for persons in institutions, and which citizens of foreign countries were included in the U.S. data. Appendix E--Presents a facsimile of the 1990 census questionnaire pages and the respondent instructions used to collect the data in this report. Appendix F--Summarizes the 1990 census data products program by describing the information available in printed reports and in other sources, such as microfiche or computer tape; and provides information on where to obtain assistance. Appendix G--Contains maps depicting the geographic areas shown in this report.  GRAPHI CS Charts, statistical maps, and other graphic summaries are included in some 1990 census reports. If graphics are shown in a report, they are presented immediately after the ``User Notes'' section.

NATIONAL A DOPTION INFORMATION CLEARINGHOUSE , W ASHINGTON, D.C.   NATIONAL ADOPTION DIRECTORY --2002  INTRODUCTION This is the 2002 edition of the National Adoption Information Clearinghouse (NAIC) National Adoption Directory. The Directory was prepared under contract number GS - 35F- 0264J for the Children's Bureau, Administration for Children and Families, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  H  OW  TO USE THIS DIRECTORY  This directory begins with a section on national adoption resources followed by adoption- related information specific for each State, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. As with any directory, information becomes outdated quickly; therefore, we do not guarantee the current accuracy of the listings. Addresses and telephone numbers may change frequently. Disclaimer: The National Adoption Information Clearinghouse has collected information on licensed adoption agencies, support groups, postadoption counseling organizations, and search support organizations and printed it in this directory as a service to the adoption community. We cannot vouch for the services provided by these agencies or individuals. It is always advisable to get recommendations from former clients of the agency or individual before making any financial commitment to a particular agency, counselor, or consultant.  NATIONAL A DOPTION INFORMATION CLEARINGHOUSE , W ASHINGTON, D.C.   NATIONAL ADOPTION DIRECTORY --2002  2  STATE ADOPTION RESOURCES The types and definitions of information contained in each State listing are presented below. Each listing provides the information in the following order. Statewide Adoption Recruitment Line The Statewide Adoption Recruitment Line is a phone number--usually toll- free--to call for information about adoption and the adoption process in a particular State. (Not all States sponsor adoption recruitment lines, and some toll- free numbers will only work within the State.) Some phone numbers offer a menu of options, including adoption. Other numbers link directly to the State's adoption exchange, which has information on the children in that State who are waiting for families. Statewide Foster Care Recruitment Line The Statewide Foster Care Recruitment Line is a phone number--usually toll- free--to call for information about becoming a foster parent and the foster care system in a particular State. (Not all States sponsor foster care recruitment lines, and some toll- free numbers will only work within the State.) Some phone numbers offer a menu of options, including foster care. State Adopt ion Specialist Generally an employee of the State's department of social services, the adoption specialist has a comprehensive view of the State's adoption system. He or she can usually provide information on children who are available for adoption, statistical data, licensed agencies, closed records, State adoption statutes, subsidized adoption programs, adoption registries for adopted adults and birth parents, and other adoption information. State Foster Care Manager The State Foster Care Manager in each State is the administrator or program manager who has oversight responsibility for all foster care services provided to children in the custody of the State/County. The Foster Care Manager is usually the key point of contact for programmatic issues or concerns, and may be able to provide statistics on foster children. Generally, however, families interested in becoming foster parents should contact their local public agency.  NATIONAL A DOPTION INFORMATION CLEARINGHOUSE , W ASHINGTON, D.C.   NATIONAL ADOPTION DIRECTORY --2002  3  State Licensing Specialist Generally a State government employee, the licensing specialist, among other duties, is responsible for the licensing of adoption agencies in that State. He or she also may certify an agency in another State if the agency conducts interstate adoptions. The specialist can furnish the current status of an agency's license and handles complaints about adoption agencies. State ICPC Administrator The State Administrator for the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children usually provides legal and fiscal oversight for the Compact which regulates the interstate placement of children for foster care (including foster homes, group homes, residential treatment, and institutions), adoption, placements with a parent or relatives when a parent or relative is not making the placement, or the placement of adjudicated juveniles in juvenile justice programs in other states. Whenever possible, the phone number provided is for either the Deputy Compact Administrator or the Deputy Compact Administrator's designated point of contact for adoption cases (if known). Adoption Exchanges and Photo Listings An adoption exchange is a service that primarily lists older children, children of color, and children with special needs who are available and waiting for adoption. The exchange also may have lists of adoptive parents who have been studied and approved for placement of these children. The exchange attempts to match waiting children to these parents. A ""regional"" exchange lists children and families from several surrounding States. A ""state"" exchange lists children and families from each State. A photo- listing service compiles a book or database with pictures and descriptions of waiting children who are available for adoption. Adoptive applicants, especially those who have already completed an adoption home study may subscribe to one or more photo listings. Applicants interested in any of the children may contact the photo- listing service or their agency.  NATIONAL A DOP TION INFORMATION CLEARINGHOUSE , W ASHINGTON, D.C.   NATIONAL ADOPTION DIRECTORY --2002  4  State Reunion Registry Many States allow adopted adults and birth relatives who are searching for one another to enter their names on a central registry, where the two parties may be matched and placed in contact with one another. State reunion registries may be either passive (meaning that both parties must register for a match to be made) or active (meaning that when either party registers, a search is initiated for the other party). State Confidential Intermediary Services Law regarding the ability of birth relatives to access information about adoptions varies from State to State. Many states offer adopted adults, birth parents, and other birth relatives the opportunity to exchange information via third parties who contact each party to secure their consent to the release of information. These confidential intermediaries then put the birth relatives in direct contact with one another, if such contact is desired. Attorney Referral Service State bar associations will provide the names of attorneys who will represent parties in adoption proceedings. These are attorneys with a specialty in family law. The associations may also provide some general guidelines about fees for these legal services. Regional/District and Local Public Agencies A public agency is one that is financed and operated by State, county, or local government. Most do not charge fees or charge only small fees for their services. Some States have centralized their services in regional offices that serve designated counties. In these cases, the counties served by the regional or district office are listed in the entry. Local public agencies generally provide the following services: . . . . Child protection services for children in foster care Family assessment and preparation for adoption Adoption placement and postplacement services Post- legal adoption services.  NATIONAL A DOP TION INFORMATION CLEARINGHOUSE , W ASHINGTON, D.C.   NATIONAL ADOPTION DIRECTORY --2002  5  Private Adoption Agencies Private agencies listed are licensed by their respective States. License status, however, may change. Prospective adoptive parents should confirm with the State Licensing Specialist on the status of an agency before dealing with the agency. We recommend that prospective adoptive parents narrow their choices down to the one or two agencies with which they want to work. Prospective parents then should contact the State Attorney General's Office and the State Licensing Specialist of the State local to the agency to see if there are complaints on file regarding the agencies they are considering. A not- for- profit private adoption agency is financed and governed by a community board of directors. It is not a government - run organization, although in most States agencies are licensed or approved by the government. Some agencies are incorporated as a for- profit concern. Please check an agency's incorporation status. Birth parents and adoptive parents should deal only with ""licensed"" or ""approved"" private agencies. A sectarian private agency is one affiliated with a particular religious group. A nonsectarian agency serves applicants regardless of religious affiliation. Private agencies generally charge fees for the adoption services they provide. This fee is often waived or reduced when parents are interested in adopting an older child, a child of color, or one with special needs. Private adoption agencies typically provide the following services: . . . . Pregnancy and relinquishment counseling Family assessment and preparation for adoption Adoption placement and postplacement services Postadoption services.  Adoptive Family Support Groups Parent support groups offer prospective adopters information, education, counseling, and assistance before, during, and after an adoption. In addition to addressing the individual needs of adoptive families, many groups are vocal advocates for the reform and improvement of the adoption system.

Some have libraries of adoption- related materials and sponsor conferences, workshops, discussion groups, and social activities.

GX251-44-10284446	"Missouri Country Adventures 2002 Agritourism Guide   Welcome to the 2002 Missouri Agritourism Directory. On these pages you will find a wealth of information on one of Missouri's most valuable assets. Agriculture has always been the heart of the social values that make Missouri such a great place to live. In fact, at one time most Missourians were raised on farms or in small rural communities. Although most citizens now have a lifestyle outside the agriculture industry, all Missourians can enjoy the experience and benefits of farm life through agritourism. Agritourism can be defined as rural, farm-based destinations designed for the enjoyment and education of the public. Many Missouri farm businesses have opened their gates to visitors, proudly welcoming the public to share the experience. Families can enjoy a variety of quality time together in rural Missouri, whether choosing the perfect Christmas tree, spending an afternoon fishing, or enjoying an educational tour. Other options include staying at a farm bed and breakfast, navigating a corn maze, or taking in some of the many local fairs and festivals. I encourage you to ""Come out to the Country"" and experience the fun, excitement and hospitality that can only be found in rural Missouri.

GX054-56-8648443	Map Data - Topics         Mercury Awareness Program Schools   Go to Table   Mercury is a significant health threat, especially to young children. Mercury poisoning can  affect the brain, spinal cord, kidneys, and liver. Mercury is found in many Indiana buildings,  including schools. School officials who participate in the Mercury Awareness Program have signed a pledge  that they will inventory buildings for items that contain mercury, purchase non-mercury substitutes  where possible, create a phase-out plan for devices that contain mercury, and recycle items that  contain mercury. By doing so, these officials are demonstrating their commitment to creating a  safe environment for the children and families they serve.

GX039-88-4944321	Map Data - Topics         Mercury Awareness Program Schools   Go to Table   Mercury is a significant health threat, especially to young children. Mercury poisoning can  affect the brain, spinal cord, kidneys, and liver. Mercury is found in many Indiana buildings,  including schools. School officials who participate in the Mercury Awareness Program have signed a pledge  that they will inventory buildings for items that contain mercury, purchase non-mercury substitutes  where possible, create a phase-out plan for devices that contain mercury, and recycle items that  contain mercury. By doing so, these officials are demonstrating their commitment to creating a  safe environment for the children and families they serve.

The decennial census is the only national survey providing consistent, uniform measures and data for every geographic area in the nation. The results capture a picture in time of the population of Utah; who we are, how we've changed, and the direction we are heading- demographically, socially, and economically. Cities and Counties of Utah is the first in a series of Census 2000 Briefs to provide detailed analysis of the Utah Census 2000 data. This report contains tables, figures, and maps showing current and historical population data for Utah's counties, cities, census designated places (CDPs), and reservations. The report begins with a 1990-2000 summary population table for the U.S., Utah, and Utah's counties and cities. This section is followed by more detailed demographic analysis of the state, including data on population density, land area, and growth and size rankings. The last section of the report provides users with a historical look at Utah and the growth that has occurred over the last hundred years. State of Utah Utah's April 1, 2000 population reached 2,233,169. This represents a population increase of 510,319 persons, or 29.6% from 1990, ranking Utah fourth among states in the rate of population growth from 1990 to 2000. Utah grew more than twice as fast as the U.S. (13.2%) during this ten year period. Utah, as well as four of its neighboring states, ranked as the five fastest growing states in the country during the last decade. They include: Nevada (66.3%), Arizona (40.0%), Colorado (30.6%), Utah (29.6%), and Idaho (28.5%). Utah's Counties Largest . Salt Lake County continues to be the state's largest county with a population of 898,387 in 2000, followed by Utah County (368,536), Davis (238,994), Weber (196,533), Cache (91,391), and Washington  (90,354) Counties. Daggett County remains the smallest county in the state with a 2000 population of 921. Three out of every four people in the state live in the northern metropolitan area, including Weber, Davis, Salt Lake, and Utah Counties, where 1,702,450 residents, or 76% of the state's population reside. Fastest Growing. Summit County was the fastest growing county over the decade, nearly doubling in size and increasing 92%, from 15,518 in 1990 to 29,736 in 2000. Seventy percent of the growth occurred in the unincorporated area of the county. Washington and Iron County were the second and third fastest growing counties, respectively, in the state during the 1990s. Washington County, with an 86% increase over the decade, grew at nearly three times the state rate. Iron County, grew more than twice the state rate from 1990-2000, with a 63% increase. Five of the state's fastest growing counties form a ring of high growth around the northern metropolitan counties. These counties include Summit (92%); Tooele (53%); Wasatch (51%); Juab (42%); and Sanpete (40%). Among the other fastest growing counties in the state are Utah (40%); Daggett (34%); and Cache (30%) Counties. Carbon County, with a growth rate of just 1% over the decade, was the slowest growing county in the state. Most Dense. Salt Lake County remains the most densely populated county in the state with 1,218.4 persons per square mile. Other densely populated counties include Davis (784.9); Weber (341.5); Utah (184.4); Cache (78.5); and Washington (37.2). Garfield County is the least dense county in the state with less than one person per square mile. Utah's Cities Largest . Salt Lake City continues to be the largest city in the state with a 2000 population of 181,743, followed by West Valley City (108,896); Provo 2   (105,166); Sandy (88,418); Orem (84,324); Ogden (77,226); West Jordan (68,336); Layton (58,474); Taylorsville (57,439); and St. George (49,663). Fastest Growing. The City of Draper lead the way among the state's fastest growing cities (greater than 9,000). Draper more than tripled in size from 19902000, increasing by 18,000 people, or 248%. Several other of the state's largest cities doubled in size over the decade, including South Jordan (141%); Lehi (125%); Riverton (122%); and Syracuse (102%). Most Dense. Taylorsville is the most densely populated city in the state with 5,376.2 persons per square mile. Other densely populated Utah cities include Midvale (4,627.4); Orem (4,573.6); Washington Terrace (4,477.4); Roy (4,330.8); Sandy (3,961.5); and South Ogden (3,917.1). Howell Town in Box Elder County is the least dense city/town with only 6.2 persons per square mile. Utah's Census Designated Places (CDPs) A CDP is a statistical entity comprising a dense concentration of population that is not within an incorporated place but is locally identified by a name. CDPs are delineated cooperatively with state and local and tribal government officials based on Census Bureau guidelines. For the first time in Census 2000, CDPs do not have to meet a population threshold to qualify for tabulation of census data. Largest . The ten largest census designated places in Utah in 2000 are all located in Salt Lake County. Kearns CDP is the largest with a population of 33,659, followed by Millcreek CDP (30,377); Cottonwood Heights CDP (27,569); Magna CDP (22,770); and East Millcreek CDP (2,385). Fastest Growing. Of those CDPs present in both the 1990 Census and Census 2000, Montezuma Creek CDP had the largest percent change in population over the decade (214.9%). Erda CDP was the second fastest growing CDP, increasing by 127.5%, followed by Stansbury Park CDP (122.1%); Little Cottonwood Creek CDP (43.2%); and Oquirrh CDP (36.8%).  Most Dense. The eleven most densely populated CDPs in the state are located in Salt Lake County. Kearns CDP is the most dense with 6,994.1 persons per square mile, followed by White City CDP (6,912.6); Millcreek CDP (6,160.5); Oquirrh CDP (5,950.3); and Canyon Rim CDP (5,033.6).

CDPs are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the state in which they are located. The boundaries usually are defined in cooperation with local or tribal officials. These boundaries, which usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or other legal entity boundary, have no legal status, nor do these places have officials elected to serve traditional municipal functions. CDP boundaries may change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary.  *New CDP for Census 2000 Source: U.S. Census Bureau  42   Census Designated Places Ranked by Population Size Size Rank 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 CDP Kearns CDP Millcreek CDP Cottonwood Heights CDP Magna CDP East Millcreek CDP Cottonwood West CDP Canyon Rim CDP Oquirrh CDP Little Cottonwood Creek Valley CDP Mount Olympus CDP *Summit Park CDP White City CDP Hooper CDP *South Snyderville Basin CDP Maeser CDP Erda CDP Stansbury Park CDP Granite CDP Dugway CDP *North Snyderville Basin CDP *Benson CDP *Benjamin CDP *Oljato-Monument Valley CDP *West Mountain CDP *Daniel CDP *Lake Shore CDP *Riverside CDP Fort Duchesne CDP *Aneth CDP *South Willard CDP Neola CDP Montezuma Creek CDP *Palmyra CDP *Spring Lake CDP *Cove CDP *Navajo Mountain CDP Whiterocks CDP *La Sal CDP *Woodland CDP *Bluff CDP *Avon CDP *Timber Lakes CDP *Elberta CDP *White Mesa CDP *Halchita CDP *Peter CDP Randlett CDP *Spanish Valley CDP *Samak CDP *Tselakai Dezza CDP *Halls Crossing CDP Mexican Hat CDP *Garden CDP *Cache CDP County Salt Lake Salt Lake Salt Lake Salt Lake Salt Lake Salt Lake Salt Lake Salt Lake Salt Lake Salt Lake Summit Salt Lake Weber Summit Uintah Tooele Tooele Salt Lake Tooele Summit Cache Utah San Juan Utah Wasatch Utah Box Elder Uintah San Juan Box Elder Duchesne San Juan Utah Utah Cache San Juan Uintah San Juan Summit San Juan Cache Wasatch Utah San Juan San Juan Cache Uintah San Juan Summit San Juan San Juan San Juan Rich Cache 2000 Population 33,659 30,377 27,569 22,770 21,385 18,727 10,428 10,390 7,221 7,103 6,597 5,988 3,926 3,636 2,855 2,473 2,385 2,018 2,016 1,821 1,451 1,029 864 838 770 755 678 621 598 586 533 507 485 469 443 379 341 339 335 320 306 289 278 277 270 230 224 181 161 103 89 88 83 37  *New CDP for Census 2000 Source: U.S. Census Bureau  43   Census Designated Place Comparisons: 1990-2000 1990-2000 Absolute Change -99 -1,197 1,251 239 201 1,386 -6 -1,282 458 5,285 2,179 257 4,941 -200 -1,853 346 -310 -24 2,797 -57 1,311 -518 21 1990-2000 Percent Change -0.9% -4.2% 7.2% 13.4% 0.9% 127.5% -1.0% -38.8% 13.2% 18.6% 43.2% 9.9% 27.7% -69.4% -5.7% 214.9% -4.2% -4.3% 36.8% -20.3% 122.1% -8.0% 6.6% Rank By Absolute Change 17 21 7 11 12 5 14 22 8 1 4 10 2 18 23 9 19 15 3 16 6 20 13 Rank By Percent Change 14 16 11 8 13 2 15 22 9 7 4 10 6 23 19 1 17 18 5 21 3 20 12  Census Designated Place (CDP) Canyon Rim CDP Cottonwood Heights CDP Cottonwood West CDP Dugway CDP East Millcreek CDP Erda CDP Fort Duchesne CDP Granite CDP Hooper CDP Kearns CDP Little Cottonwood Creek Valley CDP Maeser CDP Magna CDP Mexican Hat CDP Millcreek CDP Montezuma Creek CDP Mount Olympus CDP Neola CDP Oquirrh CDP Randlett CDP Stansbury Park CDP White City CDP Whiterocks CDP  County Salt Lake Salt Lake Salt Lake Tooele Salt Lake Tooele Uintah Salt Lake Weber Salt Lake Salt Lake Uintah Salt Lake San Juan Salt Lake San Juan Salt Lake Duchesne Salt Lake Uintah Tooele Salt Lake Uintah  1990 Population 10,527 28,766 17,476 1,777 21,184 1,087 627 3,300 3,468 28,374 5,042 2,598 17,829 288 32,230 161 7,413 557 7,593 281 1,074 6,506 320  2000 Population 10,428 27,569 18,727 2,016 21,385 2,473 621 2,018 3,926 33,659 7,221 2,855 22,770 88 30,377 507 7,103 533 10,390 224 2,385 5,988 341  Note: This comparison includes only those CDPs present in both the 1990 Census and Census 2000.

data for all incorporated cities and towns in existence on April 1, 2000.      2 Date of incorporation indicates date of first incorporation.  Several cities and towns have been reincorporated after disincorporation.  A few special instances of this kind are covered by footnote.  Great care has been taken to authenticate the date of original incorporation with the most reliable sources.  It will be noted that there are certain discrepancies between the present compilation and those prepared by the Office of the Secretary of State and by the Association of Washington Cities.        3 The census data have varied to a certain extent from one census to another.  The date for the 1890 and 1900 censuses was June 1; for 1910, April 15; for 1920, January 1; and for 1930 through 2000, April 1.      4 Auburn originally incorporated as Slaughter; name changed in 1893.      5 Bainbridge Island originally incorporated as Winslow.  In 1991, Winslow annexed the rest of the island. Name was changed officially as of January 1, 1992.      6 Population indicated for Bellingham in 1890 represents the sum of the populations for Fairhaven (4,076) and Whatcom (4,059).  The figure for 1900 was derived in the  same manner.  The name of Whatcom was subsequently changed to New Whatcom.  Fairhaven and New Whatcom were consolidated in 1903 to form Bellingham.      7 Carnation originally incorporated as Tolt; name changed in 1951.      8 No population figure published for Colton in 1890.  In a few instances, the precise date of incorporation of a municipality may be ambiguous.  For example, the certificate  of election to incorporate Colton was filed in 1890 although a certified copy of order of incorporation was not issued until 1893.      9 Du Pont originally incorporated in 1912, disincorporated in 1926, and reincorporated in 1951.      10 Issaquah originally incorporated as Gilman; name changed in 1899.      11 Kalama disincorporated and reincorporated in 1890.      12 Houghton and Kirkland consolidated as of August 1, 1968 under the name of Kirkland. The population of Houghton in 1950 and 1960 is included with the figures shown  for Kirkland on these dates.      13 Kittitas was not incorporated until 1931, but the Census Bureau listed population figures for Kittitas in 1920 and 1930.  These figures have not been included in the  present table.  Although LaCrosse was incorporated in 1917, the Census Bureau did not determine separately the population of LaCrosse in 1920.  Selah was  incorporated in 1919, but no population figure was indicated in the census reports for 1920.      14 La Conner disincorporated in 1886 and reincorporated in 1890.      15 The population figures in the published Federal Bureau of the Census reports for Medical Lake include improperly the residents of Eastern State Hospital (established in 1891) and Lakeland Village (established as a separate institution in 1915), before these institutions were actually annexed to the municipality of Medical Lake in 1947.  An attempt was made by the Bureau to correct the population figures for 1910 through 1940, but apparently these adjustments did not entirely eliminate the errors in the  original figures.  Accordingly, the figures for 1910 through 1940 must be considered unreliable.      16 Mercer Island Town annexed to Mercer Island City on June 1, 1970.      17 Palouse originally incorporated as Palouse City; name changed in 1894.      18 Port Orchard originally incorporated as Sidney; name changed in 1903.      19 Richland originally incorporated in 1910.  In 1943 it was completely replaced by a much larger planned community, the main residential area for the newly constructed  center for manufacturing plutonium.  The population of the old town of Richland never exceeded 279. It was dissolved as a corporate town in 1948.  The new community  of Richland was incorporated in 1958.      20 Spokane originally incorporated as Spokane Falls; name changed in 1890.      21 The city of Tacoma, later referred to as ""old"" Tacoma, incorporated in 1875.  New Tacoma, a separate municipality, incorporated in 1881.  In 1884, ""old"" Tacoma and  New Tacoma were consolidated as Tacoma.      22 Tumwater originally incorporated in 1869, disincorporated in 1877, and reincorporated in 1883.      23 Union Gap originally incorporated as Yakima City; name changed in 1905.      24 Vader originally incorporated as Little Falls; name changed in 1913.      25 Although incorporated before the official census date (June 1), no figure was indicated separately in the 1890 census for the town of Winlock.  The population for  Winlock precinct was given as 877.      26 Yakima originally incorporated as North Yakima; name changed in 1918.      27 Westlake annexed to Moses Lake, July 5, 1972.    Note :  Liberty Lake, Spokane County, incorporated on August 31, 2001.     $ Indicates a correction to the federal 1990 census count. Corrected 2000 federal census counts were not available at the time this table was prepared.     * Indicates that a state special census count was used rather than the federal census count.    top             Table LT03     Last modified January 10, 2002   OFM Home   Data Book Main Page   Data Book Table of Contents"
GX268-91-8469664	"ANNEX B RIVERINE FLOODING (INCLUDES FLASH FLOODS)  I.  TYPE OF HAZARD  Riverine Flooding II. DESCRIPTION OF HAZARD  Floods are the number one weather-related killer in the United States. Between 1990 and 2002, Missouri recorded more than 81 deaths attributed to flooding. A flood is partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas. Riverine flooding is defined as the overflow of rivers, streams, drains, and lakes due to excessive rainfall, rapid snowmelt, or ice. There are several types of riverine floods, including headwater, backwater, interior drainage, and flash flooding. Flash flooding is characterized by rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. This type of flooding impacts smaller rivers, creeks, and streams and can occur as a result of dams being breached or overtopped. Because flash floods can develop in a matter of hours, most flood-related deaths result from this type of event. The areas adjacent to rivers and stream banks that carry excess floodwater during rapid runoff are called floodplains. A floodplain is defined as the lowland and relatively flat area adjoining a river or stream. The terms ""base flood"" and ""100-year flood"" refer to the area in the floodplain that is subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year, based on historical records. Floodplains are a vital part of a larger entity called a basin, which is defined as all the land drained by a river and its branches. The land that forms the State of Missouri is contained within the Mississippi, Missouri, Arkansas, and White River Basins. The Mississippi River Basin drains the eastern part of the state, the Missouri River Basin drains most of the northern and central part of the state, the White River Basin drains the southcentral part of the state, and the Arkansas River Basin drains the southwest part of the state. The Missouri River Basin drains over half the state. When the Missouri River joins the Mississippi River at St. Louis, it becomes part of the Mississippi River Basin, which is the largest basin, in terms of volume of water drained, on the North American continent. In some cases, flooding may not be directly attributable to a river, stream, or lake overflowing its banks. Rather, it may simply be the combination of excessive rainfall or snowmelt, saturated ground, and inadequate drainage. With no place to go, the water will find the lowest elevationsareas that are often not in a floodplain. This type of flooding, often referred to as sheet flooding, is becoming increasingly prevalent as development outstrips the ability of the drainage infrastructure to properly carry and disburse the water flow. Flooding also occurs due to combined storm and sanitary sewers that cannot handle the tremendous flow of water that often accompanies storm events. Typically, the result is water backing into basements, which damages mechanical systems and can create serious public health and safety concerns. III. HISTORICAL STATISTICS  Missouri has a long and active history of extensive flooding over the past century. Scores of river communities, such as those along the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers, have become quite skilled and  MISSOURI HAZARD ANALYSIS  B-1  SEPTEMBER 2003   experienced in flood-fighting efforts due to frequent instances of severe flooding in recent years. Flooding along Missouri's major rivers generally results in slow moving disasters. River crest levels are forecast several days in advance, allowing communities downstream sufficient time to take protective measures, such as sandbagging and evacuations. Nevertheless, these flood disasters extract a heavy toll in terms of human suffering and extensive losses to public and private property. By contrast, flash flood events in recent years have caused a higher number of deaths and major property damage in many areas of Missouri. Ranking among the state's most notable flood disasters are the Missouri River flood of 1927, which spread destruction across 17 million acres, and the flood of 1951, which caused an estimated $400 million in damage. Record flooding also occurred in 1973 along the Mississippi River, where backwater inundated 474,000 acres at a loss of $40 million. The unseasonably heavy rainfall produced severe headwater flooding along many of the area's tributary streams, particularly in the St. John's Basin in Missouri and along the St. Francis and White Rivers in Arkansas. Of special historic interest is the December 1982 flood that spread dioxin-contaminated soil in the Times Beach area near St. Louis and led to a federal buyout of the entire town. In the fall of 1986, record flooding returned in Missouri, as well as in Michigan, Illinois, Kansas, and Oklahoma, with all these states declared federal disaster areas. Significant flooding next occurred in the state in the spring of 1990, particularly along the Missouri River in western, central, and portions of eastern Missouri. Record-level, repetitive flooding occurred from1993 through1995, and flash flooding ravaged several areas of the state in July and October 1998. In the springs of 1999 and 2000, flash flooding and severe storms again battered portions of the state. Note: Counties designated as Disaster Areas in the 1993-1995, 1998, 1999, and 2000 floods are identified on maps in Section VII of this annex. Floods of 1993-1995 The floods of 1993 through 1995 represent Missouri's worst repetitive flood events. Within this time frame were five Presidential Disaster Declarations, including four in just one 12-month period. This period extended from May 6, 1993, when the first declaration was issued by President Clinton, to April 17, 1994, when the fourth declaration was approved. Flooding in the spring of 1995 resulted in a fifth disaster declaration, issued on June 2, 1995. The ravages of these floods left a legacy of destruction, human suffering, and property damage of unprecedented terms in Missouri history. The fact that Missouri would need several years to recover from these repetitive flood disasters was undisputed. In 1993 alone, a total of 112 of Missouri's 114 counties were included in at least one or more of the declarations. Only Cedar County in southwest Missouri and Dunklin County in the southeast portion of the state were not included in any of the 1993 declarations. Floods of 1998 Severe flash flooding in the summer and fall of 1998 took a heavy toll in terms of lives lost and extensive property damage in several areas of the state. In all, at least 17 people died as a result of the two flood events. Almost all of the casualties occurred when people attempted to drive their vehicles through rushing water, overturned their vehicle into floodwaters, or were trapped and swept off a flooded bridge. Both flood incidents ultimately resulted in Presidential Disaster Declarations to provide state and federal assistance in the declared counties. Spring 1999 and 2000 Floods On April 3, 1999, a heavy rainstorm in southeast Missouri caused severe flash flooding in Madison County, including the communities of Fredericktown and Marquand. One death (due to electrocution)  MISSOURI HAZARD ANALYSIS  B-2  SEPTEMBER 2003   was attributed to that flood event when 7 to 10 inches of rain fell over a 2-hour period, causing the St. Francois River to crest at twice the height of flood stage. More than 400 homes were adversely affected, with nearly half receiving significant water damage within the living spaces. Seven businesses were damaged, and five were determined to be destroyed. On April 20, 1999, a Presidential Disaster Declaration for individual assistance (MO-DR 1270) was approved for Madison County and five additional counties (Andrew, Cole, Osage, Iron, and Macon) were later approved by FEMA as add-ons to that declaration as a result of subsequent tornadoes and storms. More than 30 Missouri counties were also designated as eligible for disaster relief for agricultural losses suffered from the April storms. For two consecutive spring seasons, Missouri experienced devastating flash flooding that forced hundreds of people from their homes and caused millions of dollars in property damage to both homes and businesses. Although the flash flooding in both events was confined to few areas, the type of devastation was equal or greater than some of Missouri's worst river flooding events. On May 6 and 7, 2000, a slowmoving storm unleashed 15 inches of rain in Franklin and Jefferson Counties in less than 24 hours. The city of Union in Franklin County was among the hardest hit due to extreme flooding from Flat Creek. In all, 10 counties were included in Presidential Disaster Declaration MO DR 1328, issued on May 12, 2000. Three counties were declared eligible for public assistance and individual assistance, and seven others were declared for individual assistance. Spring 2003 Flash flooding occurred on May 7th and 8th, and became a major flooding event across all of southern and central Missouri through the early afternoon of May 9th. In addition to the numerous road closures, bridges blocked by debris, evacuations of towns, campgrounds, parks, and moderate river flooding, many communities had their worst flooding in more than 10 years. In Howell County, the most significant damage occurred after the Warm Fork River washed out a portion of train track four miles southeast of West Plains, resulting in a train derailment. Four locomotives, each weighing 260,000 pounds, and 10 railroad cars were knocked off the tracks allowing diesel fuel to flow freely onto the ground. In addition to all of the flash flooding reports, river flooding became significant as all of the southern Missouri rivers rose above flood stage by the middle of May. Some of the rivers crested at levels equivalent to the 1993 flood event. IV. MEASURE OF PROBABILITY AND SEVERITY  In terms of overall damage, Missouri's most severe single hazard is flooding. While the state averages some 26 tornadoes each year, damage is generally confined to small areas with few fatalities, if any. By contrast, flooding has resulted in more federal disaster declarations in Missouri than any other hazard in the past three decades. Prior to the Great Floods of 1993, Missouri received federal disaster declarations due to flooding in the spring of 1990, October 1986, June 1984, December 1982, August 1982 (Jackson County), April 1979, September 1977, July 1976, June 1974, and for extensive flooding in April 1973 and again in November 1973. Missouri's vulnerability to flooding is greatly increased because it is subject to flooding from two principal sources: the Missouri River Basin and the upper Mississippi River Basin. Over one-third of the annual monetary losses due to flooding in the Missouri River Basin occur within the State of Missouri. Flash flooding can occur virtually anywhere in the state experiencing an abundance of rainfall in a very short time span, as with the November 1993 flood disaster, and floods of 1998 and 1999. The backing up of tributary stream flows creates flooding problems along the Mississippi River, especially in the southern area of the state where the land tends to be very flat and at low elevations. Even though many flood  MISSOURI HAZARD ANALYSIS  B-3  SEPTEMBER 2003   control projects have been implemented and directly aid in flood prevention, the state is still flood prone due to its geography and location. The National Weather Service has three response levels for alerting the public as to the danger of floods, as described below: Response Level Flood Watch Flood Warning Flood Advisory Activity Flash flooding or flooding is possible within the designated area. Flash flooding or flooding has been reported or is imminent. Necessary precautions should be taken at once. Flooding of small streams, streets, and low-lying areas, such as railroad underpasses and urban storm drains, is occurring.  The threat of flooding is more likely in the spring, when late winter or spring rains, coupled with melting snow, fill river basins with too much water too quickly. Spring also represents the onset of severe weather in the form of thunderstorms, tornadoes, and heavy rains, which can generate flash flooding along these storm fronts. However, as demonstrated by the disaster declarations in December 1982 and the Great Summer Flood of 1993, severe flooding can occur in Missouri at any time of the year. Based on this information, the State rates the probability and severity of floods as high. V. IMPACT OF THE HAZARD  The Federal Emergency Management Agency estimates that more than 216,000 households are within designated floodplains in Missouri. In addition, thousands of other Missouri residents are at risk to the dangers of flash flooding from rapidly rising creeks and tributaries, storm water runoff, and other similar flooding events. Nationwide, most flood deaths are from flash floods, and nearly half of these fatalities are auto related, according to the National Weather Service. Of the 49 deaths recorded during the floods of 1993, 35 (71 percent) were from flash floods. In that same category, 20 deaths (77 percent) were related to motor vehicles caught in flash floods. Missouri's river flooding in 1993 claimed 14 lives, with 6 deaths (23 percent) attributed to motor vehicles. (See floodrelated mortality charts and maps in Section VII.) Missouri flood disasters have inflicted tremendous loss in terms of damage to personal property, businesses, infrastructure/public property, and agriculture. Total losses during the 1993 flood disasters were estimated at approximately $3 billion. In addition, agricultural losses were estimated at $1.8 billion, as 3.1 million acres of farmland were either damaged or went unplanted because of the 1993 rains. The Department of Agriculture estimated that 445,000 acres of Missouri River bottomland were destroyed by washouts and sand scouring. While levees designed to protect up to 50-year floods did their jobs, the amount of rain and up-river flooding took their toll. Of the 1,456 public and private levees in the state, approximately 840 were damaged. Almost every Missourian was at some time affected by the 1993 floods through inundation of roadways, airports, and drinking water and sewage treatment facilities, and by loss of income. The Missouri Department of Labor and Industrial Relations reported that $6.2 million was disbursed for disaster unemployment assistance for people who lost work due to flooding from July 1993 through March 1994.  MISSOURI HAZARD ANALYSIS  B-4  SEPTEMBER 2003   The floods of 1993-94 pointed out that too many Missourians were living in a floodplain. To rebuild in the floodplains, those whose homes sustained substantial damage (50 percent or more) were required to elevate the structures above the base flood level to protect from future flood damage. Under Missouri's Community Buyout Program, more than $30 million in federal money was committed to moving Missourians voluntarily out of the floodplains through the acquisition of primary residential properties. As a result of those actions, it is estimated that state taxpayers will save more than $200 million in future flood disaster claims. VI. SYNOPSIS  Flood events are often accompanied by other types of severe weather, including tornadoes, lightning, and severe thunderstorm activity. These storms also present a danger to life and property, often resulting in many injuries, and in some cases, fatalities. Floodwaters themselves often interact with hazardous materials. This has prompted the evacuation of many citizens near such materials stored in large containers that could break loose or puncture as a result of flood activity. Such events occurred during the 1993 flood, when approximately 11,000 St. Louis residents residing near flood-threatened propane tanks were evacuated on July 30. Evacuations were also ordered on July 31, when bulk propane tanks were flooded by the River Des Peres in St. Louis County. Federal and state agencies retrieved more than 247 large storage tanks; 1,178 small tanks; 3,470 large drums (over 15 gallons); and 5,731 small drums that had been swept away by the floods. Public health concerns that may result from flooding include the need for disease and injury surveillance, community sanitation to evaluate flood-affected food supplies, private water and sewage sanitation, and vector control (for mosquitoes and other entomology concerns).

General Information:  Named for President Andrew          Jackson, Jackson County was formed in 1852 from Lane County          and the unorganized area south of Douglas and Umpqua          Counties. It included lands which now lie in Coos, Curry,          Josephine, Klamath and Lake Counties. The discovery of gold          near Jacksonville in 1852 and completion of a wagon road,          which joined the county with California to the south and          Douglas County to the north, brought many pioneers.

Huelsmann Chairman Gary W. Gillis Vice Chairman Robert E. Spurlin Commissioner  PSC approves consolidation of Blue Grass Energy and Harrison County Rural Electric Cooperative FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE October 4, 2001 Contact: Jill Midkiff (502) 564-3940, ext. 208  FRANKFORT, Ky.  The Kentucky Public Service Commission (PSC) today announced that it has approved the consolidation of Blue Grass Energy Cooperative Corporation and Harrison County Rural Electric Cooperative Corporation. The consolidation will result in a two percent reduction in the residential rates of Harrison's customers. A January 2001 consolidation study, commissioned by the two co-ops and conducted by Harper Consulting, estimated a cost savings of more than $10,000,000 as result of the consolidation. The boards of directors of Bluegrass and Harrison approved the consolidation in May 2001 and the members of both cooperatives approved the consolidation by mail ballot in August of this year. The consolidation will become effective January 1, 2002. ""This consolidation is a real win-win situation for all interested parties,"" Marty Huelsmann, PSC chairman, said. ""Any time a co-op can reduce costs and share services, the customers will benefit."" Harrison County Rural Electric Cooperative has 13,000 customers in Bourbon, Bracken, Grant, Harrison, Nicholas, Pendleton, Robertson and Scott counties. It is located in Cynthiana.The headquarters for Blue Grass Energy Cooperative Corporation is located in Nicholasville and serves nearly 33,000 customers in Anderson, Estill, Fayette, Franklin, Garrard, Henry, Jackson, Jessamine, Madison, Mercer, Nelson, Shelby, Spencer, Washington and Woodford counties. Harrison's Cynthiana office will become Blue Grass district office. Blue Grass also has district offices in Lawrenceburg and Richmond.

WASTEWATER TREATMENT This regional compilation of wastewater planning information (Chapters 18-26) includes specific breakouts for each county in the Bluegrass Area Development District. Blue Grass Area Development District had an estimated population of 631,849 (263,248 households) in 1999 with a projected population of 705,934 (315,125 households) in 2020. Public sewer systems serve 425,000 area residents, or 67 percent of the population. Proposed sewer line extensions for the period 2000-2020 would provide service to an additional 6,600 households. About 207,000 people in the region rely on onsite treatment systems. ANDERSON COUNTY A. Designation/Mapping of Planning Area 1. The Planning Area Map shows existing facilities, and the facilities planning boundary projected for 2018. Except for Western School, which operates a package treatment plant that discharges into Mud Lick Creek and is maintained by Anderson County Board of Education, all the areas in the county outside the planning area rely on on-site wastewater treatment systems. http://wris.ky.gov/wma/wastewater/wwplanlinks.htm#chap18 2.

Spagnolo State Superintendent of Education   FOREWORD  This listing of school districts by community type was compiled from the 1990 Decennial Census obtained through the National Center for Education Statistics, U.S. Department of Education. Illinois public school districts of 1996-97 are classified as urban, suburban or rural by staff of the Illinois State Board of Education. The school districts are presented alphabetically by organization type (elementary, high school and unit). This listing was prepared by Richard Yong of the Center for Policy, Planning and Resource Management. Questions concerning this report may be directed to Mr. Yong at 217/782-3950 or ryong@spr6.isbe.state.il.us.   ILLINOIS PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICTS BY COMMUNITY TYPE  Classification of School Districts by Community Type Each public school district in Illinois is classified as urban, suburban or rural on the basis of a combination of the following three criteria: 1. the proportions of each school district's population classified as urban residents and rural residents, respectively, by the U.S. Bureau of the Census; 2. the location of the school district, whether inside or outside of a metropolitan area; and 3. the area served primarily by the school district, whether inside or outside the central city/cities of a metropolitan area. See Appendix A for definitions of selected terms obtained from the U.S. Bureau of the Census and Appendix B for a map of Illinois showing the metropolitan areas.  Definitions of Community Types Urban School District: Any school district headquartered inside a metropolitan area and serving the central city/cities of the metropolitan area is classified as an urban school district. Also, any school district headquartered outside a metropolitan area with more than 50% of its residents classified as urban by the U.S. Bureau of the Census is classified as an urban school district. Suburban School District: Any school district that is headquartered inside a metropolitan area, has more than 50% of its residents classified as urban, and does not serve the central city/cities of the metropolitan area is classified as a suburban school district. Rural School District: Any school district, whether inside or outside a metropolitan area, with 50% or more of its residents classified as rural according to the 1990 Federal census is classified as a rural school district.  Number and Proportion of School Districts by Community Type Since 1976-77, the number and percent of suburban school districts have steadily increased, while the number and percent of rural school districts have declined, as shown in Table 1.   There has been a slight decline in the number of urban districts over the same period. Although there are fewer rural districts currently, districts classified as rural still account for the highest proportion among the three community types. In 1996-97, there were 128 (14%) urban districts, 361 (40%) suburban districts and 416 (46%) rural districts. Table 1. School Districts by Community Type, 1976-77 to 1996-97 1976-77 Number Percent 138 310 575 1023 14 30 56 100 1986-87 Number Percent 134 355 505 994 13 36 51 100 1996-97 Number Percent 128 361 416 905 14 40 46 100  Community Type Urban Suburban Rural Total  As shown in Table 2, a majority of the elementary and high school districts are classified as suburban districts. A smaller proportion of the elementary and high school districts are rural districts. On the other hand, a substantial majority of the unit districts are rural districts. Table 2. School Districts by Community and Organization Type, 1996-97 Elementary Number Percent 27 237 128 392 7 60 33 100 High School Number Percent 19 60 28 107 18 56 26 100 Unit Number Percent 82 64 260 406 20 16 64 100  Community Type Urban Suburban Rural Total   The unit of analysis in this report is the school district. And since there is considerable variation in student enrollment among Illinois school districts, the distribution of districts by community type in this report may not necessarily reflect the population or student enrollment distribution in the State. Thus, although 46% of the school districts are classified as rural, the Census Bureau reports that rural population constitutes only 15.4% of the total population in Illinois. Table 3 shows the student enrollment distribution based on the community type of the school districts. Table 3.

A. U.S. Census Bureau Definitions of Selected Terms  Urban and Rural The Census Bureau defines ""urban"" for the 1990 census as comprising all territory, population, and housing units in urbanized areas and in places of 2,500 or more persons outside urbanized areas. More specifically, ""urban"" consists of territory, persons, and housing units in: 1. Places of 2,500 or more persons incorporated as cities, villages, boroughs (except in Alaska and New York), and towns (except in the six New England States, New York, and Wisconsin), but excluding the rural portions of ""extended cities."" 2. Census designated places of 2,500 or more persons. 3. Other territory, incorporated or unincorporated, included in urbanized areas. Territory, population, and housing units not classified as urban constitute ""rural."" In the 100-percent data products, ""rural"" is divided into ""places of less than 2,500"" and ""not in places."" The ""not in places"" category comprises ""rural"" outside incorporated and census designated places and the rural portions of extended cities. In many data products, the term ""other rural"" is used; ""other rural"" is a residual category specific to the classification of the rural in each data product. In the sample data products, rural population and housing units are subdivided into ""rural farm"" and ""rural nonfarm."" ""Rural farm"" comprises all rural households and housing units on farms (places from which $1,000 or more of agricultural products were sold in 1989); ""rural nonfarm"" comprises the remaining rural. The urban and rural classification cuts [sic] across the other hierarchies; for example, there is generally both urban and rural territory within both metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas. In censuses prior to 1950, ""urban"" comprised all territory, persons, and housing units in incorporated places of 2,500 or more persons, and in areas (usually minor civil divisions) classified as urban under special rules relating to population size and density. The definition of urban that restricted itself to incorporated places having 2,500 or more persons excluded many large, densely settled areas merely because they were not incorporated. Prior to the 1950 census, the Census Bureau attempted to avoid some of the more obvious omissions by classifying selected areas as ""urban under special rules."" Even with these rules, however, many large, closely built-up areas were excluded from the urban category.   To improve its measure of urban territory, population, and housing units, the Census Bureau adopted the concept of the urbanized area and delineated boundaries for unincorporated places (now, census designated places) for the 1950 census. Urban was defined as territory, persons, and housing units in urbanized areas and, outside urbanized areas, in all places, incorporated or unincorporated, that had 2,500 or more persons. With the following three exceptions, the 1950 census definition of urban has continued substantially unchanged. First, in the 1960 census (but not in the 1970, 1980, or 1990 censuses), certain towns in the New England States, townships in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and Arlington County, Virginia, were designated as urban. However, most of these ""special rule"" areas would have been classified as urban anyway because they were included in an urbanized area or in an unincorporated place of 2,500 or more persons. Second, ""extended cities"" were identified for the 1970, 1980, and 1990 censuses. Extended cities primarily affect the figures for urban and rural territory (area), but have very little effect on the urban and rural population and housing units at the national and state levels-although for some individual counties and urbanized areas, the effects have been more evident. Third, changes since the 1970 census in the criteria for defining urbanized areas have permitted these areas to be defined around smaller centers. Documentation of the urbanized area and extended city criteria is available from the Chief, Geography Division, U.S. Bureau of the Census, Washington, DC 20233.  Extended City Since the 1960 census, there has been a trend in some states toward the extension of city boundaries to include territory that is essentially rural in character. The classification of all the population and living quarters of such places as urban would include in the urban designation territory, persons, and housing units whose environment is primarily rural. For the 1970, 1980, and 1990 censuses, the Census Bureau identified as rural such territory and its population and housing units for each extended city whose closely settled area was located in an urbanized area. For the 1990 census, this classification also has been applied to certain places outside urbanized areas. In summary, presentations by size of place, the urban portion of an extended city is classified by the population of the entire place; the rural portion is included in the ""other rural.""  Urbanized Area The Census Bureau delineates urbanized areas (UA's) to provide a better separation of urban and rural territory, population, and housing in the vicinity of large places. A UA comprises one or more places (""central place"") and the adjacent densely settled surrounding territory (""urban fringe"") that together have a minimum of 50,000 persons. The urban fringe generally consists of contiguous territory having a density of at least 1,000 persons   per square mile. The urban fringe also includes outlying territory of such density if it was [sic] connected to the core of the contiguous area by road and is within 1 road miles of that core, or within 5 road miles of the core but separated by water or other undevelopable territory. Other territory with a population density of fewer than 1,000 people per square mile is included in the urban fringe if it eliminates an enclave or closes an indentation in the boundary of the urbanized area. The population density is determined by (1) outside of a place, one or more contiguous census blocks with a population density of at least 1,000 persons per square mile or (2) inclusion of a place containing census blocks that have at least 50 percent of the population of the place and a density of at least 1,000 persons per square mile. The complete criteria are available from the Chief, Geography Division, U.S. Bureau of the Census, Washington, DC 20233.  Metropolitan Area The general concept of a metropolitan area (MA) is one of a large population nucleus, together with adjacent communities that have a high degree of economic and social integration with that nucleus. Some MA's are defined around two or more nuclei. The MA classification is a statistical standard, developed for use by Federal agencies in the production, analysis, and publication of data on MA's. The MA's are designated and defined by the Federal Office of Management and Budget, following a set of official published standards. These standards were developed by the interagency Federal Executive Committee on Metropolitan Areas, with the aim of producing definitions that are as consistent as possible for all MA's nationwide. Each MA must contain either a place with a minimum population of 50,000 or a Census Bureau-defined urbanized area and a total MA population of at least 100,000 (75,000 in New England). An MA comprises one or more central counties. An MA also may include one or more outlying counties that have close economic and social relationships with the central county. An outlying county must have a specified level of commuting to the central counties and also must meet certain standards regarding metropolitan character, such as population density, urban population, and population growth. In New England, Ma's are composed of cities and towns rather than whole counties. The territory, population, and housing units in MA's are referred to as ""metropolitan."" The metropolitan category is subdivided into ""inside central city"" and ""outside central city."" The territory, population, and housing units located outside MA's are referred to as ""nonmetropolitan."" The metropolitan and nonmetropolitan classification cuts [sic] across the other hierarchies; for example there is generally both urban and rural territory within both metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas. To meet the needs of various users, the standards provide for a flexible structure of metropolitan definitions that classify an MA either as a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) or as a consolidated metropolitan statistical area (CMSA) that is divided into primary   metropolitan statistical areas (PMSA's). Documentation of the MA standards and how they are applied is available from the Secretary, Federal Executive Committee on Metropolitan Areas, Population Division, U.S. Bureau of the Census, Washington, DC 20233. Central City In each MSA and CMSA, the largest place and, in some cases, additional places are designated as ""central cities"" under the official standards. A few PMSA's do not have central cities. The largest central city and, in some cases, up to two additional central cities are included in the title of the MA; there also are central cities that are not included in an MA title. An MA central city does not include any part of that city that extends outside the MA boundary. Consolidated and Primary Metropolitan Statistical area (CMSA and PMSA) If an area that qualifies as an MA has more than one million persons, primary metropolitan statistical areas (PMSA's) may be defined within it. PMSA's consist of a large urbanized county or cluster of counties that demonstrates very strong internal economic and social links, in addition to close ties to other portions of the larger area. When PMSA's are established, the larger area of which they are component parts is designated a consolidated metropolitan statistical area (CMSA). Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) Metropolitan statistical areas (MSA's) are relatively free-standing MA's and are not closely associated with other MA's. These areas typically are surrounded by nonmetropolitan counties.

GX231-26-4913477	OASDI Beneficiaries by State and County, 2002  Social Security Administration Office of Policy Office of Research, Evaluation, and Statistics    Preface This annual publication focuses on the Social Security beneficiary population at the local level. It presents basic program data on the number and type of beneficiaries and the amount of benefits paid in each state and county. It also shows the numbers of men and women aged 65 or older receiving benefits. This report is a useful planning aid for Social Security Administration (SSA) field offices and for those providing information to federal, state, and local government agencies. The data are derived from the Master Beneficiary Record (MBR), the principal administrative file of Social Security beneficiaries. The national ZIP + 4 file produced by the U.S. Postal Service is used to designate the beneficiary's state and county. The ZIP + 4 file, which specifies counties in terms of 9-digit ZIP Codes, provides a more accurate designation of counties in places where ZIP Code areas cross county boundaries than that which is available in the MBR. The data include only persons whose benefits are currently payable. Those whose benefits were withheld are excluded. Some Social Security beneficiaries have a representative payee--a person designated by SSA to receive their monthly benefit when such action is in the beneficiary's best interest. About 4 percent of all adult beneficiaries and virtually all child beneficiaries under age 18 have representative payees. For most children, the representative payee is the parent with whom the child resides. For beneficiaries with representative payees, the state and county designations are those of the representative payees, not those of the beneficiaries. A special procedure (controlled rounding) has been used in preparing Tables 4 and 5 to avoid disclosure of the reason for eligibility of small groups and the amount of benefits received. Under this procedure, county data on the number of persons shown in Table 4 are changed according to the following formula: 1. If the number is divisible by 5 (ends in 0 or 5), then the numbers are not changed. 2. Otherwise, the number is rounded either to the next higher number divisible by 5 or the next lower number divisible by 5, in such a way that the difference between each rounded and unrounded cell value, each rounded and unrounded row total, and each rounded and unrounded column total is less than 5. 3. After the numbers have been rounded, the dollar amounts in Table 5 are proportionately adjusted upward or downward, as appropriate. Jennie H. Park in the Division of Retirement, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (RSDI) Statistics and Analysis programmed and compiled the data for this report. Emil Loomis designed the cover, Celine Houget edited the report, Kathryn Winstead provided production assistance, and Laurie Brown prepared the electronic versions for the Web at www.socialsecurity.gov/policy.

In addition, receiving any of these benefits may request child support services by completing a Non- Public Application for IV - D services.  made available In Ohio, these individuals not Assistance  In November 2000, a team of reviewers from the Federal Office of Child Support Enforcement visited Ohio to certify the Support Enforc ement Tracking System (SETS) for compliance with the objectives of the Family Support Act of 1988. The team returned to Ohio in May 2002 to review Ohio's progress toward correcting the problems which had been identified in November 2000. They also reviewed SETS for compliance with the objectives of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA). During this follow- up review, the Federal review team identified an additional issue. According to their report, ODJFS was not monitoring applications/referrals, which had not been accepted or denied service within twenty calendar days of receipt. An application/referral is considered to be worked and acted upon when a county CSEA worker reviews an application/referral assigned to their caseload and/or verifies the IV - A/IV - D Interface Data, builds a new case from an application, merges an application into an existing SETS case or has determined that the application is not eligible to receive child support services. The outc ome of working an application/referral is that an individual seeking services receives an automatic SETS generated notice that their application/referral for services has been either accepted or denied. For those whose applications have been accepted, the provision of services will begin. Those who have been denied services are provided an opportunity to appeal through the state fair hearing process. In response to the issue of application aging, ODJFS created the ""Un- worked Application Report"" (SETS QDE 064). The purpose of this weekly report is to provide each CSEA with a list of applications that have not been acted upon and identify the number of days that have elapsed since each application originated in SETS. The OCS Bureau of County Services, County Support Section, prepared an Application Aging Tool Kit for use by the CSEAs, which includes information on monitoring activities. Value/Benefit By meeting the 20- day time frame, CSEAs initiate child support services to families on a timely basis and meet compliance with federal regulations, thus, avoiding potential financial penalties for Ohio.

What methods did counties utilize to reduce the number of applications/referrals that were in excess of 20 days? Did they accomplish this with existing staff? If so, was overtime required? Based on the methods used to reduce the number of applications/referrals pending over 20 days, will counties be able to maintain or further reduce the current levels? Are there other performance improve ment or county monitoring initiativ es planned?
