Waller, Ph.D. -  wallersj@yahoo.com         Rock Art Acoust.     5381 Wellesley Street    La Mesa, CA 91942     Popular version of paper  3aAA1    Presented Wednesday morning, December 4, 2002   First Pan-American/Iberian Meeting on Acoustics, Cancun, Mexico      Cave paintings and ancient petroglyphs around the world are typically found   in echo rich locations such as caves, canyons, and rocky cliff faces. Analysis   of field data shows that echo decibel levels at a large number of prehistoric   art sites are higher than those at non-decorated locations. The selection of   these echoing environments by the artists appears not to be a mere coincidence.   This paper considers the perception of an echoed sound as a psychoacoustic event   that would have been inexplicable to ancient humans. A variety of ancient legends   from cultures on several continents attribute the phenomenon of echoes to supernatural   beings. These legends, together with the quantitative data, strongly implicate   echoing as relevant to the artists of the past. The notion that the echoes were   caused by spirits within the rock would explain not only the unusual locations   of prehistoric art, but also the perplexing subject matter. For example, the   common theme of hoofed animal imagery could have been inspired by echoes of   percussion noises perceived as hoof beats. Further systematic acoustical studies  of prehistoric art sites is warranted. Conservation of the natural acoustic   properties of rock art environments -- a previously unrecognized need -- is   urged.        A new area for acoustic research has arisen from a previously unsuspected relationship between ancient legends of echoes, and prehistoric art.  Could echoes have been a motivational influence for the ancient artists?  Acoustic studies at archaeological sites may be starting to answer this important question.      To illustrate the universal perception of echoes being attributed to a supernatural phenomenon in the ancient world, some examples of ethnographically-recorded legends are listed below:     - The classical Greeks numbered among their deities a nymph called Echo (Bonnefoy 1992).   - From the South Pacific: ""Echo as the bodiless voice, is the earliest of all existence"" (Jobes 1961:490).   - A Paiute legend states that ""witches have lived in snakeskins and hidden among rocks, from which they take great delight in repeating the words of passersby."" (Gill and Sullivan 1992:79).   - The Book of the Hopi describes the importance of a mythological being named Echo in the creation story (Williamson 1984).      Based on documented legends that echoes were considered to be caused by spirits, it is theorized (Waller 1993a,b) that sound reflecting locations were perceived as the dwelling places of these echoing spirits.  Special echoing places  -- such as caves, canyons, rock shelters, cliffs and stony mountainsides -- where spirits dwelt and audibly responded to mortals would undoubtedly have been considered sacred sites.  It would not be surprising then to find evidence that ritualistic activities had been conducted at such sacred echoing sites around the world, and had been decorated by the artists of those ancient cultures.  Has archaeological evidence of homage been found in these types of echoing locations?      The answer is a resounding ""YES!"".  There are hundreds of Paleolithic caves in Europe with prehistoric paintings and engravings deep within.  In Africa and Australia there are thousands of painted rock shelters.  In America the canyons of the Southwest contain thousands upon thousands of ancient petroglyphs and pictographs.  See Figure 1 for an example of rock art in the form of mysterious petroglyphs.          Figure 1.  Photograph of prehistoric rock   art (courtesy R. Kieffer).      The concept of a connection between echoes and prehistoric art occurred to the author upon hearing an echo emanate from the mouth of an Ice Age painted cave in France in 1987.  This connection of acoustics and art is important because there has been no satisfactory explanation of the motivation for the production of rock art, its unusual locations, nor the perplexing subject matter the artists chose. A number of theories on the reason for rock art production have been put forth, e.g., Hunting Magic, Shamanism (reviewed by Bahn 1997), none of which have been totally satisfactory, especially in explaining the odd locations.  It is generally conceded that the art was part of a religious ceremony.  Accumulating acoustic evidence (Reznikoff and Dauvois 1988; Steinbring 1992; Waller 2000) is suggesting that these religious ceremonies at rock art sites involved producing and listening to echoes, which could augment rather than conflict with other theories of motivation.  Producing rock art was clearly a major preoccupation for early Homo sapiens sapiens over a span of tens of thousands of years.  How much of this ancient rock art around the world might have been made in response to echoes? Â The acoustic properties of more than one hundred and fifty art sites around the world have been documented as possessing remarkable sound reflection in the form of echoes, reverberation or resonance.  At many of these sites, the echoing is so clear that painted beings can be made to speak back; the echoing voice appears to emanate from solid rock at the exact spot the artists chose to depict the beings.  Engraved hoofed animals can be heard to gallop when percussion noises bounce back as hoof beat-like echoes.  A single clap in a cavern reverberates with a thunderous sound reminiscent of the stampedes of bison painted therein.  Thus the subject matter (as well as the locations) of rock art is in accord with echoing: the artists appear to have drawn images evoked upon hearing echoes of voices and percussion sounds.      Objective sound level measurements have confirmed the echoes heard at a number of these prehistoric rock art sites.  These measurements were made using the type of impulse technique typically used for recording sound reflection (e.g., Blake 1972), together with either a sound level meter or a computer program that analyzes sound levels by time and frequency (Waller, Lubman and Kiser 1998).  By analyzing recordings made at regular intervals throughout Horseshoe Canyon in Utah, and Hieroglyphic Canyon in Arizona, it was found that the decorated places within these canyons correspond to the places with the loudest echoes (see Figure 2).            Figure 2.  Acoustic   survey of Hieroglyphic Canyon.      An example of an echogram recorded at a rock art site is shown in Figure 3.  The echo occurring after the impulse shows as a extra signal due to sound reflection, delayed by the amount of time equal to the round-trip travel distance divided by the speed of sound.  With a sufficient delay time, this extra signal is perceived as a psychoacoustic event separate from the impulse.            Figure 3.  Echogram   recorded at Petroglyph National Monument       While modern humans recognize this event as reflected sound waves and term it an ""echo"", prehistoric peoples would have had no explanation for this event, other than attributing it to supernatural spirits.  The concept of sound wave propagation and reflection is a modern paradigm, and is based on the abstraction of invisible pressure waves being diverted by boundaries between media of different densities.  In ancient times, however, the causes for many natural phenomena were explained by personification or animism, including attributing echoes to be the responses of spirits.     Acoustical physics describes the process by which sound waves reflected by the boundary between air and a denser material such as rock can result in an auditory illusion.  The echoed sound appears to emerge from within the rock, as if coming through the rock surface that seems to act like a permeable veil (analogous to light images reflected in a mirror appearing to exist on the other side of the glass that seems transparent; see Figure 4).  As an example of how real this auditory experience can seem, one researcher said, ""I first noticed the acoustics of rock art when I heard a car 'drive' out of the Buckhorn panel"" (William Biesele, personal communication 1997).            Figure 4.  Diagram of light or   sound wave reflection resulting in a virtual image apparently behind the reflecting   plane. Due to bending, the source waves of this visual or acoustic image are   perceived to be coming through the reflecting plane, giving the illusion of   permeability and depth. R, reflecting surface (concave in this example); W,   waves of light or sound; S, source; V, virtual image (magnified / amplified  in this example); A, apparent waves of light or sound.        These sound effects at rock art sites are consistent with -- may indeed have   been the foundation of -- the belief that behind the rock surface there is a   spirit world resonant with sound. The belief in the spirit world within the   rock has been described as very important and relevant to rock art images decorating   the rock surface veil (Lewis-Williams and Dowson 1990). The illusion of depth   due to sound reflection, together with the phenomenon that echoes can be experienced   as voices calling out from within the rock, could have been a likely inspiration   for the widespread belief in a spirit world within the rock. Based on what is   known globally of cultures that explained natural phenomena in terms of animism,   this belief in a spirit world behind the veil of the rock surface would be a   quite understandable common response to sound reflection.     A number of ethnographically recorded beliefs lend credence to this hypothesis: - A collection of San folklore includes the quotation: ""O beast of prey! Thou art the one who hearest the place behind, it is resonant with sound."" (Bleek and Lloyd 1911:245-247). Painted San rock shelters have been found to produce echoes, e.g., Rose Cottage Cave (Ouzman 1997). - In North America, legends of the Ojibway and Matagaming around the Great Lakes have been recorded that are remarkably similar to the San case described above.  Parallels include: belief in a spirit world within the rock; the magical rock wall appearing like a transparent window when viewed from within as if the rock paintings hung in the air; sounds of voices heard around these paintings; and spirit beings inside the rock producing many sounds such as heartbeat drumming and songs echoing across the lake (Conway 1993:149-157).     - A site in California called ""Wikwip""  contains rock art for which there exists ethnographic information: paintings were made by men preparing for ceremonial dances; the name of this site means Echo Rock, and is derived from the sound-focusing acoustical characteristics of the cave (Hedges 1992).   - There is also evidence for a direct connection between sacred beliefs regarding echoes, and the production of rock art: an indigenous tribe of central India called the Korku revere echoes and still produce cave paintings today, using echoes as a selection criteria for which caves to decorate  (personal communication, Chakraverty 1996).     While it would be impossible to prove exactly what each ancient artist was    thinking, the hypothesis that rock art occurs preferentially at sound reflecting    locations is experimentally testable. It is anticipated that such detailed acoustical    analyses will yield further insights into the cultures that produced the art.    A ""Rock Art Acoustics"" web page (maintained at  http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/9461 )    includes an on-going list of rock art sites with unusual acoustic properties    on five continents. This web page also contains clickable audio files of echoes    recorded at some of the sites, photographs of prehistoric art, a description    of the acoustic theory of rock art motivation, a list of publications, and links    to other web pages pertaining to rock art or acoustics.     A direct implication of this body of rock art acoustic discoveries is that the environment around rock art sites should be left in a natural condition so that the acoustical properties are preserved.  Documentation of acoustical properties of rock art sites, including ringing rocks, is important for reasons related to conservation.  This gives a broader meaning to the task of ""rock art recording"", which would be incomplete if it were not to include audio recording and detailed descriptions of sound characteristics.  Unless more attention is brought to the relevance of acoustics, inadvertent damage to the sound characteristics of rock art sites will continue, such as damage to sound-reflecting surfaces and construction of structures that interfere with sound waves (Waller 2000c).  Acoustical data can be used as a baseline for determining at a given site the effects over time of weather, erosion, noise pollution, site intervention and vandalism on the acoustical properties that may have been a major motivation for the art in those locations.      It is hoped that more acoustics experts will join with rock art researchers in this new investigational area of rock art acoustics.  The reader is urged to please consider this paper as a cry for help echoing through the caves and canyons decorated by our ancestors - there is much work to be done to understand what their works of art are saying.

The book includes original selections from Tom Perrotta ( Little Children ), Joshua Braff ( The Unthinkable Thoughts of Jacob Green ), Jonathan Ames ( Wake Up, Sir! ), and many more refugee and remaining Jersey scribes. This brief piece from the anthology is adapted from Christian Baumanâs new novel,  In Hoboken  (Melville House, March 2008).               by Christian Bauman               Posted: July 2, 2007               If commute you  mustâand hey, eight million a day doâgoing home nights on the PATH train from World Trade Center to Hoboken isnât too brutal. Crowded, alright, this time of day. Packed so you canât move, sure. But thatâs New Jersey; itâs all relative. There are longer commutes, deadlier rides home. NJ Transit to Trenton; good God. Driving the GWB to Fort Lee and 80 beyond; have mercy. The PATH; well, pay your buck, what the fuck. Itâs just under the river.                You donât even try to find a seat, this time of day. Slip in the door, sidle over, grab the overhead rail. Itâs all slamming elbows and assholes, but less than fifteen minutes, who cares. Donât breathe too hard and steer clear the sneezers. Actual illness leads to a waste of valuable sick time, sweet precious sick time, and you can get sick on the PATH this time of year, you bet you can. Hold your breath, hold the rail, and hang on those fifteen minutes.               The PATH, she rolls back and forth, back and forth, picking up that dark and weightless underground speed, steadying out faster she goes. PATH doesnât rattle like the NYC subway, she rolls. Her cars are cleaner, too. That's something, anyway.               "" Ho boken, laststopHoboken."" Then again as she pulls into the old blue-tile underground station. "" Ho bokenstation.  Ho boken.""               Two things born in Hoboken, New Jersey (hardly the only two things, but a good representation, as good a place as any to start), the memory of both births enshrined almost randomly on steel signs scattered like jacks across the mile-square city: the game of baseball and Francis Albert Sinatra. The former birth disputed by a small, insignificant, yet surprisingly powerful burg in upstate New York, the later birth disputed by none, yet mostly spurned by the birthee himself.               "" Ho bokenstation, laststop, leddemoff first, leddemoff first, leddemoff firstâHo bo ken.""               Crowded, the commute. Packed. But late nightsâthatâs a better story: late nights the PATH train is a shiny railed limo. Empty and spacious, your smooth, cheap cruise below the Hudson. Couples coupling sometimes in the front car or back, deep kisses, hiked skirts, furtive glances. Never a cop on the PATH, so it's just whether you care what a fellow rider sees or hears.               ""I got laid on the PATH last night,"" one overheard young commuter tells another.                ""Laid?""                ""Well. Close to it.""                ""You put the 'ho' in Hoboken, my friend.""                A pause, then, ""I think that's the sweetest thing anyone's ever said to me.""                But not evening rush hour, no. Not the commute. The commute, weâre all fish in the stream. Pushing and rubbing and pressing in all the wrong ways.                ""Leddemoff first, leddemoff firstâ Ho bokenstationlaststop.""               From the inside out, then; released from the open doors of the PATH train and packed up the stairs to the street. Follow slow, if youâre smart, hands in overcoat pockets and head up. Rise from the train. Allow the world to flow around you. A smooth stone in a rushing eddy, all that torrent racing by, rising up to Hoboken. Slide by, take her slow, unaffected.               ___                                  Christian                Bauman's  third novel,  In Hoboken , will be published by Melville House in March 2008.

In  Greek mythology  Uranus (often cited as Ouranos), or  Father Sky , is personified as the son and husband of  Gaia , Mother Earth (Hesiod,  Theogony ). Uranus and Gaia were ancestors of most of the Greek gods, but no  cult  addressed directly to Uranus survived into Classical times, [ 1 ]  and Uranus does not appear among the usual themes of  Greek painted pottery . Elemental Earth, Sky and  Styx  might be joined, however, in a solemn invocation in Homeric epic. [ 2 ]   Most Greeks considered Uranus to be primordial ( protogenos ), and gave him no parentage. Under the influence of the philosophers  Cicero , in  De Natura Deorum  (""The Nature of the Gods""), claims that he was the offspring of the ancient gods  Aether  and  Hemera , Air and Day. According to the  Orphic Hymns , Ouranos was the son of the personification of night,  Nyx . His equivalent in  Roman mythology  was  Caelus , likewise from  caelum  the Latin word for ""sky"".           Contents       1   Creation myth   2   Ouranos and Vrua   3   Cultural context of flint   4   Planet Uranus   5   Consorts and children   6   Notes   7   References   8   External links               Creation myth   In the Olympian creation myth, as  Hesiod  tells it in  Theogony , Uranus came every single night to cover the earth and mate with  Gaia , but he hated the children she bore him.   Hesiod names the  Titans , six sons and six daughters, the one-hundred-armed giants ( Hecatonchires ) and the one-eyed giants, the  Cyclopes .   Uranus imprisoned Gaia's youngest children in  Tartarus , deep within Earth, where they caused pain to Gaia. She shaped a great flint-bladed sickle and asked her sons to castrate Uranus. Only  Cronus , youngest of the Titans, was willing: he ambushed his father and  castrated  him, casting the severed testicles into the sea.   For this fearful deed, Uranus called his sons  Titanes Theoi , or ""Straining Gods"" [ 3 ] .   From the blood which spilled from Uranus onto the Earth came forth the  Gigantes , the three avenging Furies  the  Erinyes    Meliae , the ash-tree  nymphs  and according to some, the  Telchines .   From the genitals in the sea came forth  Aphrodite . Some say the bloodied sickle was buried in the earth and from this was born the fabulous  Phaeacian  tribe.   After Uranus was deposed, Cronus re-imprisoned the Hecatonchires and Cyclopes in Tartarus. Uranus and Gaea then prophesied that Cronus in turn was destined to be overthrown by his own son, and so the Titan attempted to avoid this fate by devouring his young.  Zeus , through deception by his mother  Rhea , avoided this fate.   These ancient myths of distant origins were not expressed in  cults  among the  Hellenes  (Kerenyi p. 20). The function of Uranus is as the vanquished god of an elder time, before real time began.   After his castration, the Sky came no more to cover the Earth at night, but held to its place, and ""the original begetting came to an end"" (Kerenyi). Uranus was scarcely regarded as anthropomorphic, aside from the genitalia in the castration myth.   He was simply the sky, which was conceived by the ancients as an overarching dome or roof of bronze, held in place (or turned on an axis) by the Titan  Atlas . In formulaic expressions in the Homeric poems  ouranos  is sometimes an alternative to  Olympus  as the collective home of the gods; an obvious occurrence would be the moment at the end of  Iliad  i, when  Thetis  rises from the sea to plead with Zeus: ""and early in the morning she rose up to greet Ouranos-and-Olympus and she found the son of Cronos...""   ""'Olympus' is almost always used of that home, but  ouranos  often refers to the natural sky above us without any suggestion that the gods, collectively live there,"" William Sale remarked; [ 4 ]   Sale concluded that the earlier seat of the gods was the actual  Mount Olympus , from which the epic tradition by the time of Homer had transported them to the sky,  ouranos .   By the sixth century, when a ""heavenly Aphrodite"" was to be distinguished from the ""common Aphrodite of the people"",  ouranos  signifies purely the celestial sphere itself.     Ouranos and  Vrua   Georges Dumzil  made a cautious case for the identity of Ouranos and  Vedic   Vrua  at the earliest  Indo-European  cultural level. [ 5 ]  Dumzil's identification of mythic elements shared by the two figures, relying to a great extent on linguistic interpretation, but not positing a common origin, was taken up by  Robert Graves  and others. The identification of the name  Ouranos  with the  Hindu   Varuna , based in part on a posited  PIE  root  *-er  with a sense of ""binding"" ancient king god Varuna binds the wicked, ancient king god Uranus binds the Cyclopes is widely rejected by those who find the most probable etymology is from  Proto-Greek  * worsanos , from a  PIE  root * wers-  ""to moisten, to drip"" (referring to the rain).     Cultural context of flint   The detail of the sickle's being flint rather than bronze or even iron was retained by Greek mythographers (though neglected by Roman ones). Knapped flints as cutting edges were set in wooden or bone sickles in the late Neolithic, before the onset of the  Bronze Age . Such sickles may have survived latest in ritual contexts where metal was taboo, but the detail, which was retained by classical Greeks, suggests the antiquity of the  mytheme .     Planet Uranus       Main article:  Uranus       The ancient Greeks and Romans knew of only five 'wandering stars' ( Greek :   ,  plantai ):  Mercury ,  Venus ,  Mars ,  Jupiter  and  Saturn . Following the discovery of a sixth planet in the 18th century, the name  Uranus  was chosen as the logical addition to the series: for Mars (Ares in Greek) was the son of Jupiter, Jupiter (Zeus) the son of Saturn, and Saturn (Cronus) the son of Uranus.     Consorts and children   All the offspring of Uranus are with  Gaia , save  Aphrodite , born when  Cronus  castrated him and cast his severed genitalia into the sea ( Thalassa ).       Cyclopes , one-eyed giants    Brontes   Steropes   Arges       Hecatonchires , hundred handed, fifty headed giants    Briareus   Cottus   Gyes       Titans , the elder gods    Crius   Coeus   Cronus   Oceanus   Hyperion   Iapetus   Mnemosyne   Phoebe   Rhea   Tethys   Theia   Themis       Erinyes , the three Furies.

She worked in a factory before or while at school?   ""In 1967 she left New Jersey for good, moved to New York City and met photographer Robert Mapplethorpe while working at a book store."" Suggest the sentence should break after ""City"", and merge the rest into the next sentence: she didn't move there with the express purpose of meeting him, surely?   The two music samples spread out of their box and overlap the text on my setup (Firefox v2 on Windows XP. 1280 x 1024 resolution).   ""However, several of its songs, notably ""Pissing in a River"", have stood the test of time,"" You might need a stronger ref for this, or a re-word to simply state that she still performs them.   Ref 11 doesn't seem to support the text preceding it.   Is it necessary to repeat ""Sonic"" at Fred Smith's second appearance?   "" Her son had a band called Back In Spades."" This sentence doesn't seem to have any link to those before or after it, can a more suitable home be found for it?   What is CBGB?   ""She took the stage at 9:30 p.m. (EDT) and closed for the night (and forever for the venue) at a few minutes after 1:00, after performing a medley of ""Horses"" and ""Gloria"", and finally her song ""Elegie"", while reading a list of punk rock musicians and advocates who had died in the previous years"" Couple of things that confuse me here. Firstly, she was on for 3 hours, but the sentence reads as if all she did in that time was a medley of Horses/Gloria/Elegie. Secondly, she performed Elegie  while  reading list of deceased punk musicians? If she wasn't singing, how was she performing?   Are the last two paras of 'Re-emergence' too long in relation to the coverage of the rest of her career? Particularly in the last para, a lot of space is given to a single performance.   ""All the other inductees to the Hall that night joined: Sammy Hagar and Mike Anthony of Van Halen, the Ronettes, Grandmaster Flash and Furious Five and R.E.M. including Bill Berry on drums."" This doesn't make sense. What is meant?   'Current events': reads like an advert. Can the tone be neutralised a bit?   ""Smith has been an active supporter of the Green Party"" Is she still a supporter? If so suggest: ""Smith is a long-time supporter of the Green Party.""   In general a good, informative article, which could be improved by some tightening up on referencing, and more precise use of words. Well, that's what I think, anyway.

""She was influential in the birth of the punk movement with her 1975"". You could link some music years:  1975 .   We do not know the names of her parents?   ""In 1988 she released album Dream of Life. In 1994 Fred Smith died. Shortly afterward ... "" A bit choppy IMO.   ""She toured briefly with Bob Dylan in December 1995"".

Thanks,  Zginder   ( talk ) ( Contrib )  19:25, 30 December 2007 (UTC)     [ edit ]   Review by Jayron32   Hey, I gave the article a cursory readthrough. I don't have the time at the current minute to give a full readthrough, though I intend to soon, and when I do I will make more detailed comments. First of all, if I were grading the article, I would say it is clearly a ""B"" class and not an ""A"" class at this point. Not sure what criteria it would be considered an A class, but while certain sections are excellent, others are clearly below Wikipedia standards. Some general and broad criticisms now, more detailed to come later:     The lead is a bit scattered. Paragraph organization seems funny. In general, individual paragraphs should focus on single ideas or related groups of ideas. The first paragraph seems to lack a coherent thesis. Also, the lead reads much better (IMHO) if it flows from more general and accessible facts at the start to more specific and esoteric facts later. In terms of readability, the first paragraph of the lead should be written to ""draw the reader in"". The first paragraph of this article is already dealing with beta-decay statistics and the like. It isn't very inviting for the non-chemically-minded to read through. Consider, and I hate this phrase, ""dumbing it down"" a bit for the lead. The nitty-gritty can still be treated in the main article, but the lead really should be more general.   The article is overlinked. In general, only link the first occurance of a term. For a longer article such as this it is allowable to link terms for their first occurance in each section, but there is no need to, for example, link Carbon-12 every time it appears. It is linked several times in each section. Consider reducing this so it is linked no more than once per section at the most, and if it is a short section, consider not linking it at all. Also, some very common terms not likely to be misunderstood (like ""seconds"") are also linked. See  WP:MOSLINK  for more details.   The article is sketchy on its referencing. The first 2-3 sections are scrupulously referenced, but later this falls apart. See  WP:SCG  for more information, and always err on the side of more references than less. While common scientific knowledge (i.e. something you might encounter in every single chemistry textbook) need not have specific inline citations, other places, for example where superlative statements are made (most, least, best, etc. etc.) or opinions are expressed, or surprising or non-intuitive statements, or in the case of this article, statistics or data are quoted, a source SHOULD be provided via inline citation. Interestingly, while many facts that need references lack them, some places, where there is common and uncontroversial and non-quantitative facts cites, there are a REDICULOUS number of cites. Check out the allotropes section. That first paragraph contains nothing that I would think would require more than a single cite to a single source, if that (this seems exactly the kind of paragraph that  WP:SCG  refers to as uncontroversial knowledge) and yet there are TEN footnotes for it. Ugh...   The production section is lacking entirely.     Just a start, again. When I have time to read this more thoroughly, I can make more specific critiques. However, the above should give you some stuff to work on. -- Jayron32 | talk | contribs  01:41, 31 December 2007 (UTC)     [ edit ]   Other reviews     A script has been used to generate a semi- automated  review of the article for issues relating to grammar and  house  style.

Thanks,  Ruhrfisch   ><>    03:13, 1 January 2008 (UTC)       A few comments that I hope are of some use:    I agree with the above review by Jayron32. There are too many ""[citation needed]"" entries needing a citation for this to be A-class.   I'd like to see the history section cover the discovery of the carbon isotopes and the subsequent introduction of carbon dating by Willard F. Libby.   Some logical re-arrangement of the sections is necessary. Production should go just before Applications, for example, and Allotopes should precede Compounds, rather than Characteristics.   Jargon such as ""-cloud"" should be explained.   Some of the single-sentence paragraphs need expanding or merging.       Thank you. RJH  ( talk ) 18:01, 3 January 2008 (UTC)           [ edit ]   Review by Ruhrfisch   First off I agree with the points raised by the other reviewers. I would also suggest you look at some Featured articles as possible models for improving this one.  Diamond  is featured, as are several elements ( Hydrogen  and  Titanium  to name two).   The article is currently offers a lot of information, but is not always well organized, referenced, or clearly written. Some examples from the  History and etymology  section follow.     "" The English name carbon comes from the Latin carbo for coal and charcoal,[7] and hence comes French charbon... "". I think this means the French name also comes from Latin, but it sounds as if the French somehow comes from the English. Since the next sentence is other foreign language names, why not add the French in there to avoid confusion (as they all derive from names for coal)?   "" ...while carbon in the forms of charcoal was made around Roman times... "" it should read ""in the  form  of charcoal"" and Roman times is very vague - can a more specific date be found?   "" A new allotrope of carbon, fullerene, that was discovered in 1985 includes nanostructured forms such as buckyballs and nanotubes.[14] "" First off, I think most people would agree these are multiple allotropes of carbon (not one allotrope). I also think  fullerenes  are not generally seen as including  nanotubes . Perhaps ""The 1985 discovery of C 60 , a new allotrope, has led to isolation of many more fullerene and nanotube allotropes of carbon"" or something similar would be a better way to say it.     In the  Allotropes  section, the two most important allotropes are graphite and diamond, then the amorphous form. I would start with those and describe each clearly, then move on to the more exotic forms. I would also label the figure with letters corresponding to the figure (so a) diamond, b) graphite...). I would try to be clear about structures and show how lonsdaleite can be seen as derived from the diamond structure (but hexagonal) and nanotubes can be seen as derived from the graphite stucture (rolled sheet). I would also mention hybridization here (i.e. diamond sp 3  and graphite sp 2 ).   The next section,  Characteristics , repeats some information and the table comparing properties is something that I doubt would pass at  WP:FAC  (describe it instead). The table is also slightly misleading as the left column is three different allotropes, while the right is two allotropes.   I am not going to go through each section, but try to follow summary style better - the articles on  allotropes  and  allotropes of carbon  both describe what allotropes are better than this. The  Carbon cycle  section starts off by discussing the rarity of transmutation of the elements, which is just bizarre (though I understand the point, it could just start by saying ""The amount of carbon on Earth is effectively constant""). I see no mention of the role of C in global warming and greenhouse gases. In the compounds, there should be an inorganic section to go with the organic one and it should include more on things mentioned elsewhere in the article (like steel and carbides). A good copy edit (just try reading it aloud) is also needed, but so many other changes need to made first that copyediting now is a waste of time (although I do note that Texas and New York have finally achieved nationhood as "" Graphite is found in large quantities in New York and Texas, the United States, Russia, Mexico, Greenland, and India. "").   Finallly, I note that the references tend to be internet based, which are likely less reliable (see  WP:RS ) than the many books on carbon that are available in any good library. Some of the books cited are also quite old - surely there are newer works available? Hope this helps,  Ruhrfisch   ><>    20:54, 7 January 2008 (UTC)     [ edit ]   Production   The new production states that in South Korea and Austria are major deposits, which might be right, but the larges producer nearly 10 times larger than the second is china, which is stated in the  graphite  article. The production of C60 and diamonds has to be included. -- Stone  ( talk ) 10:52, 21 January 2008 (UTC)     [ edit ]   Occurence   First it is said that 900 Gigatonns coal reserves plus 150 of oil and gas exist than a few lines later the statment 4000 Gt, or 80% of coal, gas and oil reserves occure which is a much higer number. -- Stone  ( talk ) 13:52, 27 January 2008 (UTC)     [ edit ]   Sir Gawain and the Green Knight     Article  ( Edit | History )   Article talk  ( Edit | History )   Watch article    Watch peer review       previous PR     This article needs copy-editing and MoS help to get to FA.

There is so much good information on this page. I think, however, it could be arranged a bit more effectively and some repetitious information could be cut out. Here are my suggestions:   Larger issues:     I copy edited the article a bit as I was reading, but someone should copy edit it who is dedicated to that task (I was trying to review at the same time). I also don't know every line of the  WP:MOS , but I could tell that there were some inconsistencies in the article itself and with the MOS. A day spent with the MOS or a MOS-guru could help out with this.       Can we get artists' names for the illustrations and dates, when possible?           Done           I have reduced the ""Temptation and testing"" section somewhat, but I still think this can be condensed some more. There is some repetition of ideas here and I think an organizational scheme based around the five tests might result in a more concise explanation.           Should it be condensed or should the bit about fives be moved into a new section about number symbolism? I'd prefer a new section, myself.  Wrad  ( talk ) 02:41, 18 January 2008 (UTC)           Let's try the new section and see what happens.  Awadewit  |  talk  03:12, 18 January 2008 (UTC)           Already started. I didn't like the old testing section since it just seemed to get so into detail that it was hard to see the main thrust.  Wrad  ( talk ) 03:21, 18 January 2008 (UTC)           The new section now exists in name only. There are some things I'd like to add to it and a lot more I plan on taking away.  Wrad  ( talk ) 03:39, 18 January 2008 (UTC)           Done  There is now a numbers section with a good amount of research behind it.  Wrad  ( talk ) 03:29, 19 January 2008 (UTC)                           We need a reason in the ""Nature and chivalry"" section as to why Woods and Green's interpretations are being contrasted. Clearly hundreds of scholars have written on these issues. Why are these two included in the article? Explain to the reader. This is a larger problem with the article as a whole. Scholars' names are quite prominent - is there a way to reduce this? For example, if you know that three major scholars agree on a reading, there is no need to mention their names - just put the citations all together in the notes. In my opinion, it is only when someone comes up with a distinctive interpretation that is always attributed to them in the scholarship should we mention their names (the Ingham looks like a good example) or when we are quoting (why we should try to quote sparely). This is a hard balance to achieve, but we want the poem and the interpretations to come though, not the scholars themselves.           I've had the same feeling. I'll work through this. So just reword the quotes and only name names in particular cases?  Wrad  ( talk ) 02:44, 18 January 2008 (UTC)           Right. The Ingham case is a good example of when naming names works - there is a good reason to.  Awadewit  |  talk  03:12, 18 January 2008 (UTC)           Done  I just combined the two scholars on nature. Their differences are not significant enough to describe in this article.  Wrad  ( talk ) 03:21, 18 January 2008 (UTC)                   Material from ""The Green Knight"" seems like it belongs under ""Similar stories"" - it seems like sections should be joined together somehow.           I'll rewrite this. It's leftover from before we even had a  Green Knight  article.  Wrad  ( talk ) 02:44, 18 January 2008 (UTC)           Done  I've reworked it. Might want to look again.  Wrad  ( talk ) 03:39, 18 January 2008 (UTC)               It seems that maybe the extensive description of the pentangle in ""Temptation and testing"" should go in the ""Pentangle"" section.           I agree.  Done   Wrad  ( talk ) 02:44, 18 January 2008 (UTC)           The poet of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight directly addresses the ideals of knighthood by including the symbol of the pentangle and a drawing, for example, of the pentangle, would suggest a symbol of infinity. In the poem, the first description of the pentangle is immediately before Gawain leaves to find the Green Knight, when he showed forth the shield, that shone all red/ with the pentangle portrayed in purest gold. The poet uses precisely 46 lines to describe the arming of Gawains equipment, revealing the underlying meaning of the pentangle. No other symbol in the poem gets as much attention or detail given to it. There is no passage as explicitly described as this one, as if the poet wishes his words here to be read very closely, because the pentangle is a conventional sign and not a natural one. A natural one has the same meaning for everyone, but a conventional sign would imply a deeper meaning, so that 46 lines would be necessary for its explanation.  - I don't understand this paragraph.           Done  That paragraph has now been melded into other things, at least the important parts.  Wrad  ( talk ) 03:29, 19 January 2008 (UTC)           The second paragraph of ""Girdle"" doesn't really make sense to me.           Done  I took it out. It blows a passing comment in an article way out of proportion.  Wrad  ( talk ) 03:24, 18 January 2008 (UTC)           The ""Wound"" section can probably be cut down - it seems a bit repetitive.           It doesn't even talk about the best stuff, either. This section and the numbers one need to be re-researched.  Wrad  ( talk ) 03:41, 18 January 2008 (UTC)           Done  After some research, I think it is much better now.  Wrad  ( talk ) 03:29, 19 January 2008 (UTC)               There are a lot of unattributed quotes in ""Romantic interpretation"".           Done   Wrad  ( talk ) 22:12, 19 January 2008 (UTC)           I did not feel that the ""Romantic interpretation"" section explained anything new. It seemed like it could be cut without any great loss. I understand that it is trying to show Gawain as a ""romance hero"" but it doesn't do this yet. Perhaps some of the current material should be cut and a little description of the genre of the romance should be included?           Done   Wrad  ( talk ) 22:19, 19 January 2008 (UTC)           Might not the ""Order of the Garter"" material work as a subsection under the ""Romantic interpretation"" section?           A very good idea. That section has always bugged me.  Wrad  ( talk ) 02:48, 18 January 2008 (UTC)           Done   Wrad  ( talk ) 03:29, 19 January 2008 (UTC)               The ""Modern adaptions"" section seems a little thin - what happened to the story between the medieval era and the twentieth century?           Not much, really. It wasn't even rediscovered until the Victorian period. That should probably be in there...  Wrad  ( talk ) 02:48, 18 January 2008 (UTC)           Oh! Yes, that does seem like crucial information, doesn't it?Â :)  Awadewit  |  talk  03:12, 18 January 2008 (UTC)           I can't seem to find this. I think I may be remembering things wrong, since it is a Cotton manuscript and those were well-known for quite a while. I rewrote the section a bit to make it less dry, but it really seems like all there is. Not much more to add...                   References need help - not standardized at all.           Will save this for later on.  Wrad  ( talk ) 02:48, 18 January 2008 (UTC)           Finetooth is working on this.  Wrad  ( talk ) 23:06, 19 January 2008 (UTC)               The article seems to weave back and forth between AE and BE. Pick one and stick with it!           Yeah, that used to be standard but we had a bunch of Americans add some good research in their lingo. Oh well.  Wrad  ( talk ) 02:48, 18 January 2008 (UTC)           This can also be saved for the end, after all of the editing work has been done.  Awadewit  |  talk  03:12, 18 January 2008 (UTC)             Smaller issues:     The manuscript is currently in the British Library.  - I wonder if this is necessary to include in the lead? Currently, the sentence is just kind of hanging off a good introductory paragraph.           Done  Taken out.  Wrad  ( talk ) 23:11, 19 January 2008 (UTC)           Alongside its advanced plot and rich language  - I'm not quite sure what ""advanced plot"" is supposed to mean.           Done  Complex plot.  Wrad  ( talk ) 23:40, 19 January 2008 (UTC)           A later poem, The Greene Knight, tells essentially the same story as Sir Gawain, though the relationship between them is not clear.  - I wonder if there is a way to work this reference more smoothly into the lead.           I took it out for now. I'll have another look at the lead later.  Wrad  ( talk ) 23:40, 19 January 2008 (UTC)           Does the Green Knight just pick up his head and ride off or does he place his head back on his body and ride off?           The poem doesn't really say either way.  Wrad  ( talk ) 23:40, 19 January 2008 (UTC)           The Green Knight then reveals himself to be the lord of the castle, Bercilak de Hautdesert, and explains that the entire game was arranged by Morgan le Fay.  - I think you have to explain a bit (just a phrase or two) who Morgan le Fay is.           Done   Wrad  ( talk ) 23:40, 19 January 2008 (UTC)           one one-stress line rhyming a (the bob) and four three-stress lines rhyming baba (the wheel)  - There has to be a better way to write this out - it is hard to follow when reading for the first time.           Maybe just refer to the picture.  Wrad  ( talk ) 18:19, 18 January 2008 (UTC)           Done   Wrad  ( talk ) 23:40, 19 January 2008 (UTC)               On the whole, the poem takes up 2530 lines, divided into four parts and 101 stanzas.  - This sentence is just hanging off the end of the ""Verse form"" section - perhaps it should go elsewhere?           ...somewhere like the new numbers section. I have a plan.  Wrad  ( talk ) 18:19, 18 January 2008 (UTC)           Melded it into the beginning of the section.  Wrad  ( talk ) 23:40, 19 January 2008 (UTC)               For example, like the Green Knight, Cchulainn's antagonist feints three blows with the axe before letting him without injury.  - missing word           Done   Wrad  ( talk ) 23:40, 19 January 2008 (UTC)           Hunbaut has an interesting twist: Gawain cuts off the man's head, then pulls off the magic cloak keeping the man alive before he can replace his head, causing his death.  - ""interesting"" could be viewed as POV           Done   Wrad  ( talk ) 23:40, 19 January 2008 (UTC)           The Carle off Carlile also compares to Gawain in a scene in which the Carl, a lord, orders Gawain to strike him with his spear, and bends over to receive the blow.  - something is off here           Haha, yeah, I see it now. Maybe I'll take out the ""bends over"" part.  Done   Wrad  ( talk ) 23:40, 19 January 2008 (UTC)           The typical temptation fable of the medieval period presents a series of tribulations assembled as tests or proofs of mortal virtue.  - Is there a wikilink for any of this?           It's wikilinked now, but all you have to do is click on  Temptation  to see that wikipedia suffers in that area. Can't really get any more specific.  Wrad  ( talk ) 23:40, 19 January 2008 (UTC)           Through his journey in this tale, however, Gawain learns humility is a lesson that must be experienced at a level deeper than words can reach.  - I don't quite follow this.           Done  That sentenced was removed during other edits.  Wrad  ( talk ) 23:40, 19 January 2008 (UTC)           In the seduction scene, Bercilak's wife, like the boar, is a bit more forward, insisting that she knows that Gawain has a romantic reputation, and that she deserves a taste of it.  - This is starting to sound a bit colloquial.           Done   Wrad  ( talk ) 23:40, 19 January 2008 (UTC)           Both the boar and the seduction scene can be seen as depictions of a moral victory.  - a moral victory over what precisely? we should be as explicit as possible           Done  Clarified.  Wrad  ( talk ) 23:40, 19 January 2008 (UTC)           While Woods claims that nature provides stronger orders in the poem (a different kind of perfection), Richard Hamilton Green believes that the poet aims at the quest for chivalric perfection over nature.  - What does ""stronger orders"" mean? Does this sentence mean that Green believes that the poem is about conquering nature with chivalry? It is not entirely clear.           Done  Changed during larger edits.  Wrad  ( talk ) 23:40, 19 January 2008 (UTC)           The word gomen (game) is found 18 times in Gawain. Its relation to the word gome (man), which is in the poem 21 times, has led some scholars to connect them, possibly as a representation of man's fallen nature in the Christian sense.  - Perhaps this could be explained a bit more?           Done  I took out the Christian point. I want that section to focus more on game tradition and leave Christianity more to other sections, otherwise it will get repetitive.  Wrad  ( talk ) 05:11, 20 January 2008 (UTC)           Times, dates, seasons, and cycles within Gawain are often noted by scholars.  - This is a weak beginning to a section - why are they noted by scholars? Why are they significant? They sentence needs a ""because"" clase.           Done  added one.  Wrad  ( talk ) 23:40, 19 January 2008 (UTC)           Imagery of inevitable fall is strengthened by the image of the fall of Troy  - You might have to add more literary context here for some readers.           Done   Wrad  ( talk ) 05:01, 20 January 2008 (UTC)           Usually, Gawain is said to have an eagle symbol on his shield.  - ""usually"" - as in the other versions of the story?           Done   Wrad  ( talk ) 05:01, 20 January 2008 (UTC)           Most critics agree that gender plays a role in the poem but differ about whether gender supports the colonial ideals or replaces them as two cultures interact in the poem.  - Make it clear which two cultures.           Done   Wrad  ( talk ) 05:01, 20 January 2008 (UTC)           There is also a large amount of critical debate surrounding the political landscape at the time.  - vague           Done   Wrad  ( talk ) 05:01, 20 January 2008 (UTC)           Ingham sees the poem as a reflection of a hybrid culture that plays the existing strong cultures off of each other to create something new  - What's the something new?           Done   Wrad  ( talk ) 05:01, 20 January 2008 (UTC)           Is Patty Ingham's theory based on colonialism or post-colonialism? When I heard her speak, I swear she was talking about post-colonialism, but that was a few years ago now.           Seems pretty post-colonialist to me.  Wrad  ( talk ) 05:01, 20 January 2008 (UTC)           Strangely, Gawain's journey leads him directly into the centre of the Pearl Poet's dialect region  - Why is this strange?           Done   Wrad  ( talk ) 05:01, 20 January 2008 (UTC)         This article has the meat to be an FA. I just think it needs some good copy editing, a bit of reorganization, and some polishing. Nice work, everyone!  Awadewit  |  talk  02:37, 16 January 2008 (UTC)         How about I just reread the entire article again, when you are done with the list, like I did with  Hamlet ? This is such an important piece of literature. I am willing to put in a lot of reviewing time.  Awadewit  |  talk  07:46, 19 January 2008 (UTC)           [ edit ]   Comments from Scartol   At  Awadewit 's suggestion, I've had a look at this very comprehensive article  well done on covering so many aspects of this crucial text. I've done a copyedit, and didn't realize until afterwards that you're shooting for a BrEng style (and I'm a bleedin' yank). I've checked to make sure I didn't ""bollocks"" anything up too badly, but you may want to give it another ""how's your father"".   Below I've listed some thoughts and questions, mostly about small matters of prose. Please don't feel the need to respond in detail with green ticks. I leave to your judgment which items to implement and which to merely consider.     For my own sake I'm going to mark through what gets done/skipped/whatever.  Wrad  ( talk ) 00:25, 24 January 2008 (UTC)     Lead     Per  WP:LEAD , I think an article of this length should have a four-paragraph lead. I recommend splitting the last paragraph into one on symbolism/themes and one on interpretations.       The first sentence has six wikilinks; to forestall an overdose, I suggest delinking ""knight"". This leaves us with two sets of bumping links, but those are worthwhile.       The poem survives on a single manuscript...  I'd say ""survives  as  a single manuscript"". When I see the first part of that sentence (""survives on""), I think we're discussing a parchment or  stone .       The structure of the text is unclear as explained in the first paragraph. At first read, it would appear it's a poem with three commentaries (?), but then we have ""The four narrative poems..."". This is confusing to me.       Insofar as we've linked to Arthur in the first paragraph, do we really need  Arthurian legend  linked in the second? I know they're links to two different articles, but maybe it's a distinction best saved for the body of the article itself.       I'd like to have the end of the story explained in the lead.       The story of Gawain's struggle to meet the appointment and his adventures along the way demonstrate chivalry and loyalty.  Maybe ""his commitment to chivalry""? I'd like to see these traits attributed or their presence described in just a little more detail.       critics often compare  Gawain  to similar older works ... in order to find possible meanings and contexts for the symbolism and themes within the poem.  I don't know how useful the last part of this sentence is. How about at least shortening it to: ""in order to find additional meanings and contexts.""?     Plot synopsis     Can we get a year for its setting?           No.  Wrad  ( talk ) 00:25, 24 January 2008 (UTC)           A gigantic Green Knight...  Can we get something less egregious than ""gigantic""? It just feels like an odd description. Is he very tall for a human? Twice human size?           fixed  Wrad  ( talk ) 02:49, 27 January 2008 (UTC)           Gawain tells them of his  New Year's Day  appointment at the Green Chapel  So the earlier decapitation incident took place around New Year's during the previous year? Is this important enough to include in the first paragraph?           I agree, fixed.  Wrad  ( talk ) 00:25, 24 January 2008 (UTC)           Is there a reason Bertilak de Hautdesert is referred to only as ""the lord""? Seems like using the name would be easier.           Makes sense to me, fixed.  Wrad  ( talk ) 00:25, 24 January 2008 (UTC)           When the lord returns with the  deer  he has killed, as agreed, Gawain responds by returning the lady's kiss to the lord...  Does he give Gawain the deer (as per their agreement)? If so, maybe we should set up a parallel structure: ""When the lord returns and gives Gawain the deer he has killed, his guest responds by returning the lady's kiss to the lord...""           Agree, fixed.  Wrad  ( talk ) 00:25, 24 January 2008 (UTC)           The plot summary is a bit confusing; why is the girdle a badge of shame? Why is Gawain upset to learn about who set up the game? You've explained this later in the article, but I'd like to see a brief explanation in this section.           Fixed.  Wrad  ( talk ) 00:25, 24 January 2008 (UTC)         The poet     ...some inferences about him can be drawn from an informed reading of his works...  Do we know for sure it's a him? The Tolkien quote seems to suggest as much, but am I correct in guessing that they're using the masculine as a generalized pronoun? I can't imagine the headache that would come with trying to gender-neutralize it, but on the other hand it seems sketchy to say it was a man if we don't really know.           They're just about absolutely sure, given the other four poems, etc.  Wrad  ( talk ) 00:25, 24 January 2008 (UTC)           I've changed the sentence ""Little is known of it, or its author, before that."" to ""Little is known about its previous ownership."" If this is inaccurate or flawed wording, please change as needed. (Since the references to Cotton and Savile are both related to ownership, it seems odd to suddenly mention its author.)           Perfect.  Wrad  ( talk ) 00:25, 24 January 2008 (UTC)           The three other works found with the Gawain manuscript...  Maybe mention when they were all found together. Did Savile purchase/come to own them as a unit?           They are all on one manuscript, fixed.  Wrad  ( talk ) 00:25, 24 January 2008 (UTC)           However, the manuscript containing these poems was written by a copyist...  I wonder if ""written"" is the right word here. ""composed""? ""transcribed""?           fixed.  Wrad  ( talk ) 00:25, 24 January 2008 (UTC)           Can we have a year for the Tolkien/Gordon edition? Could we also get a sense of how they came to the conclusions enumerated in the quote? (I assume it will be something like ""after reviewing the text's allusions, style, and themes, they concluded:"")           fixed.  Wrad  ( talk ) 00:25, 24 January 2008 (UTC)           I think the last paragraph here needs some clarification. If the most common candidate for the Gawain manuscript is John Massey, and  St. Erkenwald  is sometimes attributed to him, then I don't understand why it's controversial and generally rejected to connect them. I suppose I'm not clear on which part is accepted and which is rejected. I think it would help the reader to structure the paragraph like so (I hope this makes sense):           The most common candidate for the Gawain manuscript is John Massey   Here are some reasons why   Massey has also been connected by some people to  St. Erkenwald  because...   Other scholars date St. E to a time outside [Massey's?] era   Because of this discrepancy (or for whatever reason), connecting authorship of St. E to the Pearl Poet is still controversial           I fixed it by taking the focus away from Erkenwald and onto Massey.  Wrad  ( talk ) 02:49, 27 January 2008 (UTC)             Verse form     I don't know if we need three phrases (breath-point, pause, caesura) for one concept. I'd pick your favorite two.           Fixed.  Wrad  ( talk ) 00:34, 24 January 2008 (UTC)           This is a total case of  WP:IDONTLIKEIT , but I don't care much for the blue boxes. Any chance we could use a more toned-down  wikitable  or some such instead? (I also shudder at the sight one box being laid out as on the left side through repeated floating CSS tags. But I recognize that as a personal problem, heh.)           If someone doesn't like it enough that they fix it I won't mind much. I just did what I knew how to do.  Wrad  ( talk ) 00:34, 24 January 2008 (UTC)         Similar stories     ...Bricriu's Feast. This story parallels Gawain in several ways; like the Green Knight, Cchulainn's antagonist feints three blows with the axe before letting him depart without injury.           If you promise the reader ""several ways"", s/he should get several ways. =)   The ""him"" here is ambiguous. Maybe say: ""letting his target depart""?           Fixed both.  Wrad  ( talk ) 00:34, 24 January 2008 (UTC)               I'd like to see some years (or approximations) for the similar stories. For the Lancelot tale, maybe include a phrase along the lines of: ""The trope appears in Camelot for the first time in  Perlesvaus , when...""?           done  Wrad  ( talk ) 02:49, 27 January 2008 (UTC)           When Lancelot arrives, the people of the town celebrate and announce that they have finally found a true knight. (Apparently many knights had been tested, and failed).  I should like to have a word on what exactly is being tested here. (This might also make it possible to combine these and do away with the parentheses, which I feel should be used as rarely as possible in the article namespace.)           Fixed.  Wrad  ( talk ) 00:34, 24 January 2008 (UTC)           As with the Lancelot example above, maybe mention about Gawain: ""Gawain appears in the stories  The Girl with the Mule ..."" This kind of transition really aids readability. (Wow, spellcheck doesn't have a problem with ""readability""?)           Fixed.  Wrad  ( talk ) 00:34, 24 January 2008 (UTC)           Several stories tell of knights who struggle to stave off the advances of voluptuous women...  Is this really specific to G&GK? It seems like something which shows up all the time in literature from all over.           ...sent by their lords as a test? Fixed.  Wrad  ( talk ) 00:34, 24 January 2008 (UTC)           ...the knight is tested to see whether or not he will remain chaste in extreme circumstances.  ""extreme"" may not be the right choice of word here; having an  AK-47  to one's temple is an extreme circumstance. Having a lady visit one's room is a bit less so; maybe there's a less relative word?           fixed.  Wrad  ( talk ) 00:34, 24 January 2008 (UTC)           The last paragraph of this section is choppy and disjointed. Approximate dates of appearance would help, but I think a general attempt at structure would also be useful. Maybe give less detail, and start by saying something like: ""The elements of  Gawain  also appear in the stories...""           done.  Wrad  ( talk ) 02:49, 27 January 2008 (UTC)           Among all these stories...  In the last paragraph, or the whole section? If the latter, maybe say: ""Unique among its various successors...""?           Fixed.  Wrad  ( talk ) 00:34, 24 January 2008 (UTC)         Themes     The story of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight is a test of Gawain's adherence to the code of chivalry.  Logical coherence  the story isn't the test, is it? Maybe: ""At the heart of SGGK is a test of...""?           fixed.  Wrad  ( talk ) 01:23, 24 January 2008 (UTC)           The sentence ""Success in the proofs..."" appears suddenly. It leads me to believe there should be a sentence just before it about what happened/happens to those who fail.           fixed.  Wrad  ( talk ) 01:23, 24 January 2008 (UTC)           Gawain believes he has lost his honour and in breaking his promise has failed in his duties.  This sentence lists three things Gawain believes he has done. Can we combine it somehow so the reader only has to deal with two?       fixed  Wrad  ( talk ) 01:23, 24 January 2008 (UTC)       The ""hyndez"" (hinds) first described in the poem are probably from red deer, a species with large antlers like the American elk, while the subsequent ""dos and of oer dere"" (does and other deer) likely refer to the smaller fallow deer.  This info, while interesting, does not appear to be in any way related to the courtship. Does it really belong here? Maybe at least put it at the end of the paragraph, with a transition of some kind in front.           Made it a footnote.  Wrad  ( talk ) 01:23, 24 January 2008 (UTC)           He removes its head and sets it on high.  Isn't this last phrase a bit ambiguous? Maybe there's a technical meaning of ""on high"" with which I'm not familiar, but maybe we need ""holds it aloft"" or ""displays it on a pike"" or some such?       fixed.  Wrad  ( talk ) 01:23, 24 January 2008 (UTC)       ...nature represents a form of chaotic order...  Does not compute. I get an inkling of this meaning, but I'd choose a less abstract wording.           fixed.  Wrad  ( talk ) 01:23, 24 January 2008 (UTC)           The connection between nature and ""the temptations of Bertilaks wife"" isn't clear. I assume this refers to man's lust for sexual interactivity, but if so (or if not) some clarification is in order.           fixed  Wrad  ( talk ) 01:23, 24 January 2008 (UTC)           I wonder if ""man"" is being used to refer to humanity in the ""Nature and chivalry"" section? Or perhaps the codes of chivalry and the     ensuing meanings of the story can't be applied to both men and women. Your call.         Fixed.  Wrad  ( talk ) 01:23, 24 January 2008 (UTC)           On the flip side, the phrase  almost like an exchange of blows in a fight (or in a ""beheading game"")  is somewhat repetitive. I didn't feel comfortable cutting it out unilaterally, but I think it could be removed without any loss.           I disagree.  Wrad  ( talk ) 01:23, 24 January 2008 (UTC)           I've rewritten one sentence to read:  However, the hero's victory of the first game depends on his honesty, while his second victory depends on his purity.  I still think it's unclear, though. Maybe something like this is better: ""The hero's desire to achieve the first victory, however, results in his inability to emerge victorious in the second.""?           fix.  Wrad  ( talk ) 02:49, 27 January 2008 (UTC)           I would insert the ""Times and seasons"" paragraph into the ""Nature and chivalry"" subsection.           Not done. don't really agree.  Wrad  ( talk ) 01:23, 24 January 2008 (UTC)           The story starts on New Year's Day with a beheading and culminates on the next New Year's Day.  If the time differential is a year and a day, then wouldn't one of the events happen a day earlier than the other?           Not really, medievalists have found that because older calendars such as this were so awful, a year and a day was actually a year. People of the time seem to have understood this, using the term ""a year and a day"" to mean ""on this same day one year from now"". Weird, but true.  Wrad  ( talk ) 01:23, 24 January 2008 (UTC)           Gawain leaves Camelot on  All Hallows Day  (or All Saints Day)  Since we're linking to All Saints Day, can't we just use that as the link text?           Sure.  Wrad  ( talk ) 01:23, 24 January 2008 (UTC)           The various discussions of themes often use ""scholars say..."" but are followed by a single citation. I'd like to see more evidence that these interpretations are supported by more than one source. (This is much less of a problem in the ""Symbols"" and ""Interpretations"" sections.)

Wrad  ( talk ) 23:58, 25 January 2008 (UTC)           Other scholars have called him the ""most difficult character"" to interpret the most famous poem about him, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.           This sentence is unclear. Perhaps an ""in"" is missing before ""the most famous""?   Why is the full title used in a sentence immediately following a use of the abbreviated form? Hopefully just an oversight?           Fixed.  Wrad  ( talk ) 23:58, 25 January 2008 (UTC)               I'd provide an in-text explanation of your source for the olde-tyme definition of ""girdle"".           fix  Wrad  ( talk ) 23:58, 25 January 2008 (UTC)           I can imagine a reader asking him/herself: If a girdle doesn't mean underwear in Nibelungenlied, then how is it proof of sexual contact?           Tried to clarify. It's not like she took off her bra and handed it to him, but her girdle did have sexual meanings. Underwear isn't the only sex-symbol on the planet.  Wrad  ( talk ) 23:58, 25 January 2008 (UTC)           Gawains use of the pentangle also symbolises the phenomenon of...  (I changed ""symbol"" to ""use"" at the start here.) Does this refer to the character Gawain, or the poem?           Fixed.  Wrad  ( talk ) 23:58, 25 January 2008 (UTC)           The mathematical information at the end of the ""Pentangle"" section is interesting, but it feels like a bit of a tangent, and the connection to the poem is far from obvious.           Fix.  Wrad  ( talk ) 23:58, 25 January 2008 (UTC)           Thus, the poet makes Gawain the epitome of perfection in knighthood through number symbolism.  But he fails the test of honour, right? So how can he be knighthood perfection?           It's describing him  before  the test.  Wrad  ( talk ) 23:58, 25 January 2008 (UTC)           When quoting scholastic interpretations (as in ""escape unslain, provided that his honour might also emerge unscathed""), I prefer to have an in-text explanation of who's speaking.

This is poetic, but confusing. I'd prefer an explanation which takes less of a dramatic license.           Meh. I like it.

If I've taken liberties with the meaning, please adjust as needed.           Good.  Wrad  ( talk ) 23:58, 25 January 2008 (UTC)           When Gawain sets out on his journey to find the Green Chapel, he finds himself in distress...

Wrad  ( talk ) 23:58, 25 January 2008 (UTC)           However, it is the men who are the ultimate focus of the story and the characters who dictate the outcome.

Wrad  ( talk ) 23:58, 25 January 2008 (UTC)           I'd reorganize the ""Interpretations"" section in order of popular opinion: You state that ""Many critics argue that  Sir Gawain and the Green Knight  should be viewed, above all, as a  romance .""

The motto at the end of the poem is a form of 'honi soit qui mal y pense', meaning ""Shame be to the man who has evil in his mind."" This is the motto of the Order of the Garter.  How about rephrasing this as: ""...laws under the English  Order of the Garter . That group's motto, ""blah blah"", is presented at the end of  Gawain "" or some such?           fixed.  Wrad  ( talk ) 23:58, 25 January 2008 (UTC)           If you refer to ""Knight and Ingham"" in the middle of the colonialism discussion, it makes sense to mention them early on.           fixed.

Thanks,  APR Â  t  06:05, 14 January 2008 (UTC)     I like to nitpick by section, so here we go:     Lead    I like how the lead pulls in some of the earliest history after hitting the basic properties, although it kinda shifts rapidly into quantum, which is to some extent unavoidable. But in the sentence starting ""Following the development of quantum mechanics..."", it isn't clear that the second statement follows from the first. Also, I think idea of forces being mediated by gauge bosons needs more than one sentence to be clear, even when condensed down in the lead.       History    Avoid unnecessarily roundabout wording, such as, ""Philosophical development of the concept of a force proceeded through the work of Aristotle."" That just says, ""Aristotle's philosophy further developed the concept of force.""   I rather think that encyclopedias should avoid too many parentheses, so I've turned some into commas.   The last paragraph is so condensed, there's too much that would require clicking through to other articles to mean anything to the average reader. Why mention that Coulomb used a  torsion balance  when the inverse square law isn't even elaborated upon, or any further info on the history of the electric force given?   I think that fundamental forces are now called fundamental interactions primarily because they are mediated by gauge bosons rather than anything to do with symmetry. That last paragraph could safely end before mentioning 4-momentum, QED, or Noether's theorem.         More to come later. I'm too slow and will have to do this piecemeal.

I have transformed the original plain list into a table giving a brief description of every franchise and its original release date. Temporarily I have left the ""plain text"" version of the list there until the article finishes the peer review (we may copy it to the Simple Wikipedia later). These lists are quite used in the gaming forums (as is regarded one of the few sources for this kind of information, going as far as having  Yahoo! Games  and  The Independent  using it for their articles (even though they did not credit the usage).   I am looking for feedback about its current status, trying to get it to featured. All of the references are considered ""reliable"" in the gaming environment (from consumer sites like GameSpot and IGN, industrial sites like Gamasutra and GameDaily, and even mass media coverage like Forbes, The New York Times, BBC, etc), and all the external links are working (as last checked a few days ago). Please consider that this list may never be completed (it is currently missing obvious examples like Pac-Man, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, etc), and some references are somewhat old. I am worried about the size and whether we should restrict the franchises to a larger number (10 million like the original versionwhich would limit the list to just 86 franchises instead of 119 right now), besides obvious improvements to get it to featured status (prose, cleaning, etc).

Any suggestions are welcome. The only one I have is to talk about the theme of the series: ninja; and to also desribe more about the relationships between characters.  User:Artist Formerly Known As Whocares  16:46, 20 July 2007 (UTC)       It reads a bit fannishly, and could do with a copyedit. Grand pronouncements about the series being character-driven should be cited to critics, for example. Are there any reviews etc. of the series? (or of parts of the series) You should change the ""growth and popularity"" section to be a ""Reception"" section, in which you talk about critics and fans. Take a look at the anime wikiproject's series GAs for more ideas. - Malkinann  01:12, 21 July 2007 (UTC)           I've changed the name to reception, but I fear what would happen should I put that It is the world's most popular anime and manga series (and it most likely is), since it is original research. I know nothing else about reception. Also, I would like to mention how the series developed into what it currently is and the themes of the series. I've already started to  here , but it is far from ready to list yet. I'll start looking over other GA anime/manga articles tomorrow, I'm going to get off soon today.  Artist Formerly Known As Whocares  12:15, 20 July 2007 (UTC)                   Naruto is quite popular, but hardly the most popular.  Dragon Ball  is still the most popular Shonen Jump title of all time, while in Japan alone  One Piece  is the most popular of current titles (although, Naruto and Bleach are not far behind). Here's a site with Shonen Jump circulation numbers.  [1]   Jonny2x4  16:18, 23 July 2007 (UTC)                   Additionally you need to distinguish between  current popularity  (which will vary according to what series are currently in production) and  long term popularity  where you consider how well series were received in their time, plus the longevity of that popularity. (In the latter definition, Evangelion usually seem to come out top.)

I will suggest  Bleach (manga)  as a guide however.-- 88wolfmaster  04:49, 28 July 2007 (UTC)           Ironically, I was about to suggest we take the example the Bleach article gave us and list a small and basic summary of the main characters. The problem is, however, we need to judge just which characters are main or major. For example, none of the other characters match up with Sasuke or Naruto, but some of them play just as important a role as Sakura and Kakashi do, like Shikamaru. So, like Bleach, we should decide just what qualities a character should have to be main besides be a mmeber of team 7. I suggest:    Close to Naruto Uzumaki.   Must have battled both a member of Akatsuki and a named follower of Orochimaru at least once.       I don't have any more ideas, though.  User:Artist Formerly Known As Whocares  16:59, 1 August 2007 (UTC)         I would suggest that we only include Team 7 on the main page for simplicity's sake, and re-work the  List of characters in Naruto  article instead of adding other characters to the main page.-- 88wolfmaster  03:46, 2 August 2007 (UTC)   I've added a little to the reception section that you might like to expand upon.

I'd like to know whether y'all feel it's ready to become a FA candidate, or whether there's more than can be done to improve it. -  Brian Kendig  02:50, 11 October 2005 (UTC)     Two major things: an inordinate number of lists (should be converted to prose when possible) and no references (which is necessary for FA).  Pentawing  06:15, 11 October 2005 (UTC)           What would be a way around these problems? I don't see a way to turn those lists into prose without making a mess of them, and there really  are  no references on the subject other than the game itself. -  Brian Kendig  12:14, 11 October 2005 (UTC)                   What I find works sometimes, at least in cases where the lists are not readily convertible into prose, is to use multi-column tables, usually with {{ prettytable }} to set the style.   RJH  14:33, 11 October 2005 (UTC)   Concerning references, how about a published game guide and outside reviews? The point behind references is that one can be assured that the game actually does exist and that others can vouch for it.  Pentawing  21:50, 11 October 2005 (UTC)             The above seems fairly straightforward - anyone have any other constructive comments on the article? -  Brian Kendig  03:49, 12 October 2005 (UTC)     Lead too short - should be at least two solid paragraphs for an article this size (see  WP:LEAD )   A lot of really short paragraphs and some one-sentence paragraphs. Long paragraphs generally == good flow. Especially pronounced in ""Games"" where its basically a list masquarading as sepearte paragraphsÂ :).   ""Items that can belong to an avatar"" etc. - could use some more description of the items   Some parts read like a game/HOWTO guide, like ""Characters"". Someone once told me that an encyclopedia is not ""prescriptive"" but is ""descriptive"".... hope that helps.   Of course the list thing mentioned by the previous reviewer     Generally neat article... I think once some of the lists get turned into prose it will be a better reading length too  Ryan Norton   T  |  @  |  C  07:07, 14 October 2005 (UTC)     A script has been used to generate a semi- automated  review of the article for issues relating to grammar and  house  style.

I know the background section needs expanding, a few bits of info on the later life of Regiment 95 perhaps. Also more photos but they are hard to come by, and that its overly reliant on Fall (but then,  Battle of Dien Bien Phu  is very reliant on Davidson).

I have had some  discussions  with one of the major editors about the issue, and I think that article could benefit from some peer review, especially now that his campaign has ended.   The article uses a different frame of reference than the sister articles on  Hillary  and  Obama . I think the focus strays too far into the main developments of the race, which would be covered under the  main election article . Also, I think there are too many photos that are tangential (at best) to the main issue. For example, there are some stock photos of the other candidates, a stock photo of a fireman, and Steve Martin in 1982.

Thanks,  APR Â  t  06:36, 14 January 2008 (UTC)       [ edit ]   Missionary position   A few questions:     Are there any more subjects that need to be covered in order for this article to be considered comprehensive?   Is there a better scheme of organization that could be used?   Are any additional images needed? What do you think of the ones we have?   Do all of these variants really count as a subset of the missionary position, or are some of them different enough that they should be considered completely separate positions? (The full discussion has been centralized to  Talk:Missionary position/Votes on inclusion as missionary )    For instance, at one point, side entry was listed as a missionary variant but I removed it because I consider that to be an entirely different position.   What about gay sex and anal sex? I removed those variants because I consider missionary position to be a sexual position in which a man is on top of the woman inserting his penis into her vagina.   Does sex in which the woman is sitting on a raised surface (such as bed or table) and the man is standing up count as missionary position? I removed it because he's not really on top of her in that position per se.   What about sex in which the man is kneeling?       Are there any other variants that should be covered?   Do you have any other suggestions?     Thanks,   Sarsaparilla  ( talk ) 03:55, 9 January 2008 (UTC)   Peer review by  Wafulz     General .           The article is pretty short (26kb). I think it could use some expansion, especially considering its prevalence. {{ sexpositions }} should be added. ""Basic position"" needs to be near the beginning of the article and expanded into prose form.           Lead section .           The lead is weak, and the definition isn't very accurate. The missionary position is a male-superior coitus position (ie ""man on top"") where the partners face each other. It's also a bit jumpy and improperly organized. I think it needs three separate paragraphs: one to introduce the position, define it, and to mention its variants. The next paragraph should cover history and significance- stuff like etymology of ""missionary"" and religious/cultural stances (I believe that non-missionary sex is technically sodomy by some definitions). The last paragraph should cover the benefits and drawbacks and the popularity. It may be a good idea to include something about a small backlash against the position because some see it as subordinating women.           Commonness           This section should be retitled ""popularity"" or ""frequency."" It needs expansion and historical context - mention that other cultures had never seen it before. As much as I appreciate Kinsey's work, it shouldn't be the only source.           Perceived advantages/disadvantages           These two should be merged into one section. The writing is a bit weak but I'm just doing a general overview.           Basic position .           This section should be merged with ""implements"" and be renamed to ""Description"". From there it can flow better into ""variants"". This sentence is really odd and I don't think it merits inclusion:  November also notes the possibility of smearing a small amount of lubricant on one's stomach and chest for a result she describes as a ""really fun slip and slide effect.""  While it sounds like fun, the article shouldn't be a sex manual.         Overall I'd say the article is about halfway to featured article status. It'll also need a decent copyedit after this review. This would be a great candidate for the first sex position FA.- Wafulz  ( talk ) 21:26, 10 January 2008 (UTC)     I think a lot of information can be found about the history of missionary and the frequency and perspectives on it within different cultures. Combined with some of the other information you mentioned (e.g. more studies in addition to Kinsey), and possibly some more positions, we should be able to double the size of this article. By the way, I don't think that positions other than missionary are classified as sodomy anywhere. I looked for info about feminists deriding the missionary position but couldn't find a whole lot...I think most women actually like missionary. The feminist objections I've seen tend to be more against penetration in general (sometimes with the position of clitoris on the female anatomy used as justification that penetration isn't natural) or against men who insist on ONLY doing missionary.  Sarsaparilla  ( talk ) 05:24, 11 January 2008 (UTC)           Yeah the feminist objections may have just been to ""male superior"" positions in general and were probably more related to the notion that the man  had  to be on top. This  source  on the sodomy bit cites a History Channel TV show. This JSTOR  link gives the following abstract: "" Many states have laws which prohibit every sexual act except sexual intercourse, in the missionary position, between husband and wife. These laws have been used to repress alternative life styles because such modes of living often do not conform with the rules of traditional marital monogamy. However, recent court decisions make most private relationships between consenting adults outside the realm of the law. The effect on sex laws is seen in an increasing liberalization of these statutes. ""- Wafulz  ( talk ) 22:57, 11 January 2008 (UTC)    Wow, I would be amazed if a state law mandates the missionary position. If that's so, it should definitely go in the article. Some people on the internet claim that Washington, DC law requires missionary, but I couldn't find it in the DC code. See  http://government.westlaw.com/linkedslice/default.asp?SP=DCC-1000   Sarsaparilla  ( talk ) 01:24, 12 January 2008 (UTC)                   I got full access to the article, but it doesn't elaborate on what states held the laws. However, it discusses sodomy laws that were changed in the early 1970s, so maybe they're in some archive somewhere? I'm also getting frequent mentions of Article 125 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.  It states : (emphasis mine)       (a)  Any person subject to this chapter who engages in     unnatural carnal copulation with another person of the  same or      opposite sex  or with an animal is guilty of sodomy. Penetration     , however slight, is sufficient to complete the offense.                               (b) Any person found guilty of sodomy shall be punished as a     court-martial may direct.                               Apparently this has been interpreted as ""missionary only"" according to iffy sources. I'm trying to find more concrete sources discussing this.- Wafulz  ( talk ) 05:14, 12 January 2008 (UTC)   Actually I found a mirror of a source  here :       There is a statute prohibiting sodomy in the military: Article 125 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). (46) Article 125 is a very broadly written statute from the 1950s. The drafters of the UCMJ essentially took the Maryland and Washington, D.C. sodomy statutes and put it into the military code. In the military, anything that is not missionary position is sodomy. In the military, unlike in the civilian world, straight people are actually prosecuted for sodomy regularly. A survey of the appellate cases in the military criminal courts where there was a conviction for consensual sodomy found eighty-six cases in a three- year period. All but three involved heterosexual men convicted of conduct with a woman. One was a woman for conduct with a man, and two were for conduct between two men. - Wafulz  ( talk ) 05:16, 12 January 2008 (UTC)                 I'm also a bit skeptical about the statements that Aquinas forbade non-missionary position sex, although there are a lot of books that mentioned it. I would feel more comfortable about having that in the article if I could find one of his actual writings that mentioned it. I couldn't find it in the  summa theologica .

First things first, the article is very short, there should be some more information out there that could be added. The history of the company needs to be expanded. There should be a separate history section describing the creation and expansion of the company.   It needs  third party, verifiable  sources. At the moment the only references come from the company itself.   We don't need the """" in  A&W Root Beer .   It needs expansion in general.

Seems to be fairly well referenced, though there are a few paragraphs with no refs and at least one direct link to the web (not an inline cite) that needs to be fixed. Writing is good on a small scale, but work needs to be done on the big story and getting it to flow from section to section better. Remember this is telling a story, and try to make the story clearer. Specific points follow - not an exhaustive list.   Lead     The very first sentence is quite long and involved - is there any way it could simplified? Perhaps swap parts of the first two sentences:  Pied-noir (plural pieds-noirs) (French: black foot; pronounced /pje.nwa/) is a term used to refer to colonists of Algeria until the end of the Algerian War in 1962. Specifically, pied-noirs were French nationals of European descent, Sephardic Jews, and settlers from other European countries such as Spain, Italy, and Malta who were born in Algeria.  Now the first sentence gives the specifics and the second says ""specifically"" and gives the general definition. I think it makes more sense here to go from general to specific (as my attempt at a rewrite does).    Y  Just used your sentenceÂ :)  Lazulilasher  ( talk ) 19:44, 29 January 2008 (UTC)           The lead should summarize the whole article, at least touching on every header and subheader (even if only a word or phrase). I would check that this lead does that and also do something about the one sentence Camus paragraph.     Origin of the term     ...had been assigned to duty in the coal-room because of their experience with warm temperatures, thus causing their feet to become black.  makes it sound as if the warm temperatures turned their feet black (not the coal)    Y  Yep, you're right...reworded and broken into 2 sentences.  Lazulilasher  ( talk ) 19:44, 29 January 2008 (UTC)           The chronology and terms in the last paragraph are unclear - it seems to start in 1962 (independence) when they call themselves  Algerian[s?] in relation to metropolitan French, and as Europeans vis--vis the indigenous Arab and Berber population.  Then the next sentence goes back to the 1920s and 1930s (when Algerian begins to mean the Arabs only), then to 1955 (when Pied-noirs satrt to call themselves that - but then what about the first sentence seven years later they are call themselves Algerians or Europeans?     French invasion     Why is the etymology of dey given?    Haha...ok. Will remove.    Y  Done.               Abd al-Kader declared jihad against the French and thus began a period of full-scale war which lasted seven years.[17]  Please give the year this started.       The French Army signed two treaties with Abd el-Kader...  what kind of treaties? Peace treaties?    Y  Yep, they were. Sentence is now clarified.  Lazulilasher  ( talk ) 18:14, 31 January 2008 (UTC)           Although various pockets of the country remained independent, the war effectively ended in 1847 with the surrender of Abd al-Kader, and Algeria became French territory.[18]  I am not clear on how this differed from the situation after the French kicked out the Ottomans - weren't the French the ruling authority / government then? If it was ""occupied territory administered by France before"" or something similar please make that clearer.    Y  I clarified the history. Kader's resistance was more of an insurgency meant it took longer for the French to establish control of modern day Algeria.  Lazulilasher  ( talk ) 18:14, 31 January 2008 (UTC)         Settlement     They became known as colons, Europens, and eventually pieds-noirs.  does some of this belong in the Origin of the term section?     Pied-noir relationship to Metropolitan France and Muslim Algeria     The  WP:MOS  says not to repeat the title in headers and subheaders, so this name should be changed - perhaps to ""Relationship to Metropolitan France and Muslim Algeria""?

Some specific comments:    "" It should be noted that  in total sixteen-thousand prisoners..."" ""It should be noted that"" is one of those throw-away phrases that usually adds nothing to a sentence (and in my opinion, actually weakens it).  Y   Done   ""In total, only one hundred were taken in the area..."" This was confusing. I thought 16,000 prisoners had been taken? Y   Done   ""The men of Totenkopf fought recklessly throughout the campaign, suffering comparatively higher death rates that other German forces."" This sentence would probably be best appearing in the paragraph before the discussion of the prisoners. Y   Done   The  Manual of Style  recommends that numbers higher than ten be given in numerical form (16,000 prisoners, 200 French-Moroccan troops). This should be done for the whole article. Y   Done   ""By this time, the first German units had..."" What time? Y   Done   ""attack on the May 24."" Missing a word (night, day?) or just a typo perhaps? Y   Done   ""to preserve tanks for the upcoming campaign"" Which campaign? Y   Done   ""had been ordered to hold out for as long as possible against the Germans to give as much time as possible "" repetition. Y   Done   Linking specific places would be helpful (""Riez du Vinage"", ""Le Cornet Malo"", ""Bois de Paqueaut"", etc.) N   Not done  None have articles.   ""because the boundary between the two British regiments was the road dividing the position, Ryder's men surrendered to Knchlein, who had been fighting the Royal Scots."" Unclear and confusing. Y   Done   ""The British prisoners were marched to the barn, lined up alongside it and  were then  fired upon..."" parallelism/redundancy  Y   Done   ""forced French civilians"" Awkward. Recast sentence (""...and the Germans forced French civilians to bury the bodies..."") Y   Done   ""who were later captured by the Wehrmacht's 251st Infantry Division"" When exactly? N   Not done  I can't find anything in the sources.   ""His lawyer, Dr. Uhde"" First name?  N   Not done  Again, in every sources it is just ""Dr, Uhde"".

Ruhrfisch   ><>    01:56, 22 January 2008 (UTC)           Comments by  User:GeeJo     Ok, let me preface this by saying that I've no knowledge on the subject itself, so I'm unable to comment on any factual niggles. This'll mostly be about MoS issues.     Origins:  Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources (Canada)  could do with a link.   Origins: You could do with briefly explaining why there was a need for a trans-Canada highway. You don't need a great amount of information (that's what  Trans-Canada Highway  is for), but a summary would be helpful.   Origins: What was the general consensus in the province about the project? Was it an issue discussed by the politicians and media?   Origins: Provinbcial => Provincial   Origins: If you can find any information on the subject, perhaps you should include a brief overview of the potential routes discussed, and why the chosen route was settled on. Was there much discussion with Alberta/Manitoba over the meeting locations?   Origins: Dominion government isn't a term used widely outside certain Commonwealth countries. Perhaps switch to national (if I interpreted the term correctly myselfÂ :) )   Origins/Speed Limits: Are all the quotation boxes necessary? They break up the text significantly and I'm not sure that some of them couldn't just be explained in prose with a citation leading to the full quotation.   Maintenance: The section is only one sentence long. Either it needs expanding or it can be absorbed into another section.   Maintenance: Who is responsible for overseeing the maintenance of the highway? Is it at a local, provincial, or national level? Where does the funding come from?   Maintenance: ""a 4.6 paving project"" I have no idea what this means.   Maintenance: Link  Judy Bradley . Identify her as a provincial-level politician.   Speed Limits: Should be Speed limits   Speed Limits: ""The highway is twinned east of Regina until Highway 617 east of Wolseley."" - explain twinned.   Communities: Ok, this is where ""figures overload"" sets in. I'm not sure that all of these numbers are necessary or even relevant, and most seem to just be acting as filler. How do census figures on the towns inform readers on the highway itself? Do I really need to know about when the various post offices were established? Have a read through and take out bits that aren't germane to discussion on the highway. This may require a bit of reorganisation.   Swift Current to Moose Jaw: What is Local Improvement District (L.I.D.) #9? Why do you abbreviate it and then not use the abbreviation again (and usually periods aren't included in abbreviations)?   Swift Current to Moose Jaw: Valjean could support a post office between 1912 and 1968 - On the off-chance you really think that this belongs here: could it or did it?   Moose Jaw to Regina: <ref=""Large""/> should be <ref name=""Large""/>   Moose Jaw to Regina: You've not used the abbreviation RM before, and the link to  Pense No. 160, Saskatchewan  doesn't make it immediately obvious what it stands for.   Regina to Manitoba: This reads as a slightly prosified list. It needs a lot of work.   Regina to Manitoba: another <ref=""Large""> (and ""Solonyka, Ed & Solonyka"". The poor person's name is Solonyka Solonyka?Â :) )   Regina to Manitoba: Trans Canada highway => Trans-Canada Highway   Geophysical features: The section is one giant indigestible block of text. Break it up.   Books: Is this a bibliography or further reading? Either way, why only one entry? If there aren't more, just drop the section.   External links: Identify the sites being linked to. Perhaps (use your judgement) explain why I'd want to click on them.   Are there any perennial issues brought up by the media with regards to the highway? I ask this because in the UK, debates over  tolls  and maintenance crop up every now and then. Even if it's only at the national level, you might be able to find a few comments at the provincial level. If there aren't any debates, fair enough.   The could do with a bit of a copyedit, as word choices seem a bit clumsy at times (finally finishes and the like). I'm not really the person to ask about fixing this, but there're a few editors who specialise in this type of thing.   There isn't a single image of the highway itself in the article. Perhaps try asking at Wikiproject Canada etc for a snap or two of the road. Since the Saskatchewan section was completed in 1957, you *might* be able to get hold of some expired Crown Copyright images ({{ PD-Canada }}) of either the construction or of the first year of use. But then again, maybe not.       [ edit ]   Scotland   I'm intending to put  Scotland  forward as a Featured Article Candidate sometime in the near future.

A few comments from one read through: I have never seen footnotes in an infobox - it makes it even longer. Why are they here and not with other notes in the reflist below? It might be helpful to have the map higher in the article - those not familiar with the geography of Scotland might appreciate this. Modern History seems a bit thin after the 17th century and Highland clearances. More on the Industrial Revolution perhaps? In the Administrative subdivisions section, these sentences repeat information from the preceding section on politics and seem unnecessary:  For the Scottish Parliament, there are 73 constituencies and eight regions. For the Parliament of the United Kingdom there are 59 constituencies.  In the Law section, does the last sentence need to be its own paragraph? In Geology and geomorphology, Grampian Mountains is shown on the map, but not mentioned in the section. The Transport section has three one-sentence paragraphs.

Watch your tense: ""The rendered, three-dimensional backgrounds could not be walked into"" should be ""The rendered, three-dimensional backgrounds  can  not be walked into""   Why is there an audio section if you just present a list of the sound team?   You've got an entire paragraph dedicated to content rating. Is that necessary?   ""This placed the game fourth for the week; one position lower than Shining Force III: Scenario 1 and one position higher than J-League Winning Eleven 3."" Is it really important to say what positions three and five were?   The references need a bit of work. Never specify format=HTML. Don't put two external links in one reference, as the reader should not have to decide which is the actual reference. For foreign-language references, specify the language parameter.

Legionarius  ( talk ) 04:09, 3 January 2008 (UTC)   Comments from  Moni3 :  From someone who has concentrated a few recent edits on the detriments of water diversion from the Everglades, and a North Florida resident that looks askance on most South Florida metropolitan areas, I hope you find my recommendations even-handed...     In the History section, Lyons' heirs moving from beans to cattle - was that in the Coral Springs area? Or did they just pick up and leave after selling all the land for development? It's a little disjointed.   There are five citations for the violence and rise in gangs. This is too much citation for two sentences. Can you expand it or even it out?   What made Coral Springs so highly rated according to Money Magazine? What aspects of the city did they rate?   The reference to Trivial Pursuit in Cityscape makes it sound as if you got the fact from the game. It would be just as accurate to take out the reference to Trivial Pursuit.   In Demographics, can you put the mean income in comparison to other counties in Florida? Palm Beach County has the most money in Florida. Where does Coral Springs stand?   I've not visited Coral Springs, but surely there have to be controversies about it being such a tightly regulated community. I think they are worth mentioning.   And, really, I can't help myself. Coral Springs is a result of urban sprawl the directly impacted the Everglades negatively. I have read there are communities in South Florida looking to curb growth in the name of ecology conservation and restoration. Are there any organized movements in Coral Springs to check urban development, or at least decrease its impact on the environment?     It's apparent that you put a lot of work into the article. It is well-referenced, clean, and well-written. It does, however, read as a bit of an advertisement for the community. No urban center can be this positive all the time. There must be some local controversy, just to make it interesting. -- Moni3  ( talk ) 05:30, 3 January 2008 (UTC)     Thanks for your great comments! Let me try to address them.    I tried to explain what happened from beans to cattle a little better. They finally sold their stuff in 1961... or in the next paragraph.Â :-)   Gangs, negatives, controversy: That's the thing. I tried  really hard  to find negative views of Coral Springs for evening the POV. There is a lot of small complaints in forums and other non-RS places, but nothing I could find in RS, or coming from some kind of organization. The worst I could find was the gangs; but even the gangs problem is fairly minor, if you look closely. The strange amount of citations is related to the fact that there isn't an overall article that summarizes all the issues. What do you recommend? The facts (if you follow the links) look so minor that I balked a bit into adding more detail.   I thought the explanation of the criteria for the Money prize was a little wordy and deviated from the goal of the article, so I expanded it in the ref. What do you think?   TS reference: I thought it added a little color to the article, do you think it makes the article sound worse?   Zero movements or organizations not related to any specific group (like firemen, political party, museum benefactors etc). Couldn't find anything enviromental.   Good point about the demographics; I have to research it a bit more.       Lastly, thanks for the compliments!

I looked through the last ten years in  The Miami Herald , hoping to find  something  to make Coral Springs a bit more interesting.

Next, the comments and questions...     Consider linking ""knickerbockers"" in the lead.    Y   Done       Remove ""The.."" from your headings per  WP:HEAD .    Y   Done       Could mention position numbering, then squad numbering and names on kit in the lead as well.    Y   Done       What about home and away kits as well, are they worthy of lead mention? Also the one-offs, such as Champions League finals shirts with the event embroidered into the shirts?    Y   Done  -  added home and away colours to the lead. I don't think one-off shirts should be mentioned in the lead, it might be worth one sentence in the main body of the article if I can find a source discussing the concept.....       ""huge amounts"" - not that encyclopaedic, perhaps ""significant amounts""?    Y   Done       Don't like ""Required (basic) equipment"" as a heading - either basic or required, and explain in the section what you mean.    Y   Done  -  the slightly rubbish heading represented pretty much the only words left from before I started work on the articleÂ ;-)       ""(the Laws do not specify that studded boots need be worn)"" - you're assuming we all think studs  are  specified. Perhaps a rephrase something like ""...while most boots are studded (or bladed!), the Laws do not specify they are required...""    Y   Done       Are logos ever present on the arms or is that just the ""Premier league"" logo?    I can't find any reference to clubs with sponsor logos on sleeves. Refs have it of course, I may drop in a mention of this........       Not necessarily the right place for it in this article but there has been some controversy over the use of the blades, injuries etc. Worth a mention?    Y   Done       I've heard repeatedly of players being encouraged to wear boots one size too small for that ""special touch"" which has resulted in chronic foot damage. Again, worth a mention if you can cite it?    I've not heard of this personally but I'll look into it.....     I found  this  - starter for ten I suppose...

(you know what I mean, from your phrase...!)    Y   Done       Didn't Davids wear the goggles because of glaucoma? Probably worth distinguishing that it wasn't a fashion choice...    Y   Done       Match officials - international ref's have worn yellow quite a bit...    I'll keep looking, but thus far have not been able to find a reliable source for this point......     Still can't find any actual reference to this, but have dropped in a picture of  Howard Webb  reffing in yellow, dunno if that helps at all.....           ""This prevents confusion and wild attempts to wrest the ball from your neighbour."" - I love this.    those wacky Victorians....Â :-)       ""heavy hobnailed boots"" in the caption - proof?    Y   Done  -  changed it       Who's the loser in the cap hanging onto Cascarino's left hand?! And yes,  very  short shorts!    I actually sponsored those shorts either that season or the season before. It took me ages to save up the 10 from my pocket money......       Hmm, this may be anecdotal but what about the Man Utd grey strip (allegedly designed to be good with blue denim) which they wore for a half against Southampton (I think) going down 3-0 at half time, changing into a different strip and, still losing, at least got a goal back in the second half?

Y   Done Binarymoron  ( talk ) 07:09, 9 January 2008 (UTC)         You quote a lot of the information from the special features of the DVDs. Can you incorporate this information into expanding other sections instead of putting it into the DVD section? Maybe just list all the special features in one list. In general, the DVD section should usually be very simple and straightforward.         Y   Done Binarymoron  ( talk ) 07:09, 9 January 2008 (UTC)         Your description of the show I'm really just picturing a cross between  Wile E. Coyote  and  Teletubbies . You should really expand it in a plot section and tell exactly what goes on in each episode. Make the reader who's never seen the series picture exactly what the series is about.         Y   Done Binarymoron  ( talk ) 07:09, 9 January 2008 (UTC)     I corrected some style issues myself but your references are cited wrong. See  WP:REF  for information on how to cite your sources within the article.

In the list it mentions the fish named ""Eaten"" - any others? Also why is Mr. Stain called that? What does Palvan mean and are there any differences between the Japanese and English names in meaning (if you translated the Japanese names into English, would they all be the same)? You might want to mention here that Mr. Stain is the only character who appears in all episodes, Palvan next, etc. Some characters roles are more obvious than others - Lost kitten needs no explanation, but who is Stephanie? Is Handsome Stain real? Would ""abandoned"" be a better description of the baby than ""deserted""?     Y   Done  the cast names only appear in english, I added this in the lead.

The goal of this peer review is to get the article ready for FAC (hopefully).   Thanks!   Legionarius  ( talk ) 04:09, 3 January 2008 (UTC)   Comments from  Moni3 :  From someone who has concentrated a few recent edits on the detriments of water diversion from the Everglades, and a North Florida resident that looks askance on most South Florida metropolitan areas, I hope you find my recommendations even-handed...     In the History section, Lyons' heirs moving from beans to cattle - was that in the Coral Springs area? Or did they just pick up and leave after selling all the land for development? It's a little disjointed.   There are five citations for the violence and rise in gangs. This is too much citation for two sentences. Can you expand it or even it out?   What made Coral Springs so highly rated according to Money Magazine? What aspects of the city did they rate?   The reference to Trivial Pursuit in Cityscape makes it sound as if you got the fact from the game. It would be just as accurate to take out the reference to Trivial Pursuit.   In Demographics, can you put the mean income in comparison to other counties in Florida? Palm Beach County has the most money in Florida. Where does Coral Springs stand?   I've not visited Coral Springs, but surely there have to be controversies about it being such a tightly regulated community. I think they are worth mentioning.   And, really, I can't help myself. Coral Springs is a result of urban sprawl the directly impacted the Everglades negatively. I have read there are communities in South Florida looking to curb growth in the name of ecology conservation and restoration. Are there any organized movements in Coral Springs to check urban development, or at least decrease its impact on the environment?     It's apparent that you put a lot of work into the article. It is well-referenced, clean, and well-written. It does, however, read as a bit of an advertisement for the community. No urban center can be this positive all the time. There must be some local controversy, just to make it interesting. -- Moni3  ( talk ) 05:30, 3 January 2008 (UTC)     Thanks for your great comments! Let me try to address them.    I tried to explain what happened from beans to cattle a little better. They finally sold their stuff in 1961... or in the next paragraph.Â :-)   Gangs, negatives, controversy: That's the thing. I tried  really hard  to find negative views of Coral Springs for evening the POV. There is a lot of small complaints in forums and other non-RS places, but nothing I could find in RS, or coming from some kind of organization. The worst I could find was the gangs; but even the gangs problem is fairly minor, if you look closely. The strange amount of citations is related to the fact that there isn't an overall article that summarizes all the issues. What do you recommend? The facts (if you follow the links) look so minor that I balked a bit into adding more detail.   I thought the explanation of the criteria for the Money prize was a little wordy and deviated from the goal of the article, so I expanded it in the ref. What do you think?   TS reference: I thought it added a little color to the article, do you think it makes the article sound worse?   Zero movements or organizations not related to any specific group (like firemen, political party, museum benefactors etc). Couldn't find anything enviromental.   Good point about the demographics; I have to research it a bit more.       Lastly, thanks for the compliments!

I looked through the last ten years in  The Miami Herald , hoping to find  something  to make Coral Springs a bit more interesting. The lack of information on it makes it seem even more freakish...like the harrowing hour I spent lost in  The Villages  a few years ago.

Here are a few observations:     Reception       Needs clarifying:  One possible reason for the film's reception is that...  - you don't actually say what the reception was, though you do imply that it did badly.   Why did it do well at the box office but badly with the critics?   How does it compare box-office-wise in dollars with  Animal Crackers ,  Monkey Business ,  Horse Feathers ,  A Night at the Opera  and  A Day at the Races ? A nice simple table showing comparative grosses would be good.   Why not include the punchline in the Groucho anecdote about Casablanca and Warner Bros? It's short and funny.       Famous scenes       Reads more like fond memories than encyclopedic content. (UnderstandableÂ :)   Some external scholarship for selection of the scenes to feature would be good, ie an external rationale.   Perhaps one sub-section per key/famous scene, with a brief description of the scene, some critical input, and images?       References in popular culture       The Woody Allen reference is rather thrown away and could do with expansion.   Consider renaming to something encyclopedic like  Works referencing Duck Soup   The film must have influenced far more than you suggest. More research?   On a related point, which would make a good subsection, what material influenced or inspired Duck Soup? (The Laurel & Hardy connection is thrown away in the intro. It needs expanding.)       Footnotes and references       Bit of a mess. Clearest in my experience is to list in full every source referenced in the references section. Then in the footnotes, use very brief cross-reference. See  Hamlet  for examples. Something like:        Dirks, Tim.  Duck Soup  Review  Filmsite.org - Retrieved:  30 December  2007.   Ebert, Roger. 2000.  Duck Soup Review, July 9, 2000  rogerebert.com - Retrieved:  30 December  2007.   Corresponding footnotes <ref name = Dirks>Dirks</ref> and <ref name = Egbert>Egbert 2000</ref>           Any printed sources you can look to? Adds gravitas and, more importantly, depth (IME, webcomment tends to more superficial than printed stuff.)       Overall       Rather engagingly written but short sentences/paragraphs make it rather choppy/stubby in places.   A world politics overview section would be interesting. Economic horrors wirth worldwide depression. Emergence of Fascists in Italy, Nazis in Germany.   Have you considered a compare and contrast section, to very similar films?  The Great Dictator  springs to mind but there are bound to be others. What was the cinema landscape generally of the time?     I've concentrated on broad stroke stuff rather than nitty-gritty.

The very first thing I noticed is that the article is not complying well with the  Film MOS . It is missing some key sections (most notably cast/characters and production details). Famous scenes should be subsections of the plot and a source is needed for the declaration that those selected scenes are famous.   Musical numbers should either be moved into the plot, or reworked as a start to a more detailed production details with the lists converted to prose if possible; that could also include the current ride remark in the intro about the earlier titles of the film   Refences in popular culture is a trivia section and unnecessary, as is the side statement: ""(Groucho would later use a similar idea in his letters to Warner Brothers defending the title of A Night in Casablanca)"" in the reception section.   I'm not super familiar with these films, so I can't tell for sure if the plot summary is including the ending, but if not it needs to.   The intro needs rewriting to better fit the  lead section guidelines  and the Film MOS suggestions. Some of what's there is production note stuff that belongs further in the article, and several key basic points are missing (director, producer, original release, etc).   The disambig link should be at the top of the page, not buried in the See Also section   I'd ax the two final links in the ELs, they are fan sites that add nothing of encyclopedic value to the article   Some of the references need to be redone using the {{ cite web }} or {{ cite news }} or similar template rather than just a plain link; more references are also needed. For example, if Herman J. Mankiewicz was uncredited as the producer, a source is needed showing he was the producer. The entire first part of the music section is also unsourced, though it makes some important claims that need verifiable, reliable sources to back them up. Other similar key points are missing sources.   It's also missing the video and DVD release info. It was released to VHS in 1992, and has had several DVD released. There is also a CD soundtrack created by Soundtrack Factory.   Finally, may want to work on the tone. Some parts read more like a loving tribute from a fan than a neutral, encyclopedic articleÂ :)     I hope that helps some  Collectonian  ( talk ) 04:17, 1 January 2008 (UTC)         Cinemaniac replies:  Thanks for the critique.

I haven't much time on Wikipedia today, what with the Bowl games and all, so here's a couple of brief thoughts:     Duck Soup  is an  old  film, so I think that for the article to significantly improve, you would need to track down offline resources. I have a feeling that this film has likely been covered at length in books and newspaper articles between its release and today, so you may want to try out keywords for  Duck Soup  in Google Book Search, Google News Archive Search, and Google Scholar Search. If you have a university account, you can learn to search the keywords in newspaper articles locked in subscription-only databases. The one I've used frequently is  Access World News  -- hopefully, it's available to you! And implementing templates is also a good idea. Though I'm biased, I'd suggest  Fight Club (film)  was an example to follow. You'll see a healthy mix of offline and online resources for a 1999 film. For this one, I think that there'd likely be a slant toward offline resources. If you have questions about researching, let me know, and I can help out! I've provided subpages to some editors with some headlines.     If you have any questions at all, feel free to ask!  Erik  ( talk    contrib ) - 20:35, 1 January 2008 (UTC)         Cinemaniac replies : Thanks for your comments! I'll go ahead and start researching more for the film in order to find more offline references, so that a balance between offline and online citations can be achieved. In that regard, however, I may need your experience to help guide me through it.

Usually this is my main complaint on film articles. People make the plot section like a transcript. This one is good. However, the famous scenes section seems bloated. The first paragraph is fine, as it uses citations and proves that it is indeed famous by using the also famous I Love Lucy scene. The second through fifth paragraphs of that section don't really establish why they are famous. They may be great and funny, but why are they famous? This section really needs citations to establish famousness.   I saw in the reception section that several refs do not use citation templates. They attempt to duplicate the output, but they should really use a template.   There are a lot of uncited statements that I have tagged with {{fact}}.   I also saw that several places use parenthesis. In some of them, the parenthesis could simply be removed. My general criteria for parenthesis is this: Are the parenthesis even necessary? If they are necessary to put in a statement, does the statement really belong there or is it just stuck in?   You should try to convert the lists in Music into prose.   The ""Works Referencing Duck Soup"" section may be combined with famous scenes. Other works referencing the scene establishes that the scene is famous and may take care of the problems I cited in my first paragraph. On a quick read through, that's all I see.  ColdFusion650  ( talk ) 23:12, 1 January 2008 (UTC)     The lists of songs should not be converted to prose, i.e. in a long paragraph instead of a list. That will make it much more tedious to try to read.  Baseball Bugs   What's up, Doc?  23:24, 1 January 2008 (UTC)    The ""Original Songs"" section, apart from the first bullet, is just a list of names. It won't be that long.  ColdFusion650  ( talk ) 23:26, 1 January 2008 (UTC)    Lists are much easier to read when presented as lists. Put the interests of the reader first.  Baseball Bugs   What's up, Doc?  23:37, 1 January 2008 (UTC)   To avoid appearing too negative, I should point out that most of your changes and suggestions are good.  Baseball Bugs   What's up, Doc?  23:40, 1 January 2008 (UTC)             You assume I'm doing something other than acting in the users best interest. I disagree that a list is easier to read in this context. It creates the appearance of more length, making me want to completely skip it. Also, converting lists to prose is basically what everyone brings up on a GA or FA review. You can ignore it for now, but you can't forever.  ColdFusion650  ( talk ) 23:44, 1 January 2008 (UTC)     Lists are easier to read as lists than as a paragraph with semicolons embedded in it.  Baseball Bugs   What's up, Doc?  00:04, 2 January 2008 (UTC)    Ok, well, as a final thought on this issue, it requires no semicolons, and this will be brought up again at GA or FA time. So, it's just a postponement.

For example, see how  this short entry of trivia  became  this rambling juggernaut , and you'll see my point. However, I don't think such things apply to the list of musical numbers in the  Duck Soup  article, simply because those are the only musical numbers in the film, and so adding others would almost certainly be vandalism and be reverted. But I hope we can eventually turn the list into prose, as some other editors might see the list as  ""trivia""  and delete it without even really looking at it.   Cinemaniac   ( talk    contribs )  18:48, 2 January 2008 (UTC)                                   Good point. The only additions to such a list would either be factual additions that had been overlooked previously, or bogus additions subject to deletion. But what about other lists of songs, such as on movie soundtracks and other albums? Surely he wouldn't be arguing for converting those into prose.  Baseball Bugs   What's up, Doc?  18:54, 2 January 2008 (UTC)                                           The one difference is that soundtracks usually have numbered tracks. Maybe if the items in the list were numbered instead of being bullet points, would that please everyone?  Baseball Bugs   What's up, Doc?  20:08, 2 January 2008 (UTC)                           [ edit ]   Comments by Cliff smith   I'd like to briefly say that this article is in good shape, and as ColdFusion said, Cinemaniac and his fellows deserve props for their work. Beyond that, I also second most of what ColdFusion had to say, but I'll get specific.     The section about works referencing the film seems borderline trivia. If it can be integrated into the info on famous scenes, as long as it's properly ref'd of course, then it should be okay.   The cast usually warrants its own section. Each character should have a sentence or so of description, and perhaps an accompanying sentence about casting when available.   I'm not sure if explaining the film's title would warrant its own subsection, but that's not a major issue.   Get some more references, as many as possible. I'm aware that I don't really need to say that since it's been said already, but I think that it's an uncommon occurrance when any article can have too many references.   Like Erik said, there are probably more offline references for this film due to its age. Search 'em out.   I almost thought that the plot was too summarized, until I noticed that the film was just over an hour long. Well done on the plot summary.   Something about the film's soundtrack and VHS/DVD releases, as spoken of by Collectionian, should be present.   Finally, consider adding a sentence in the lead about the film's reception, perhaps something along the lines of how it was received when it came out and how it's perceived in present times. The lead is a little short anyway.     Well, keep up the good work: it's coming along well. And Happy New Year. Regards,  Cliff smith  ( talk ) 07:02, 2 January 2008 (UTC)         Cinemaniac replies:  Yeah, I'm trying to get some more offline sources for the article. Concerning the ""explanation of the film's title"" section, I got that idea from the  To Kill a Mockingbird  article, which I think is a good example of a good article, and which I will often look to for ways of making this article improve. Unfortunately, by next week my busy schedule will be picking up again, what with the holiday season all but over, so I won't be able to respond quickly to feedback as I have for the week or two.

Personally, I think that the plot is too bare; I have never seen this movie and when reading it I felt as if it assumed you had some knowledge of what happens, e.g. why does Teasdale want Firefly as Freedonia's leader?       I also agree with ColdFusion650 about the famous scenes section; it doesn't really establish why they are 'famous'. I would suggest that, while it isn't quite trivia, it is a bit bloated as it is and could stand to be slimmed down and possibly renamed - 'Cultural references' perhaps? - or maybe merged somehow with 'Works referencing Duck Soup'.       The reception section is excellent in my opinion; interesting to read, well written, informative and well sourced. No complaints about that. Pretty much the same for 'Pre-production and development'.       As for the songs, I think that first we could stand to lose the info about when each song is played in the film. Trivial, IMHO. However, I agree with Baseball Bugs about converting the list to prose; personally, if I just saw a paragraph that contained nothing but a list of names, I would be very tempted to gloss it over. It just wouldn't make for easy reading. Also, I think a source is needed for saying that the into to Groucho's character is similar to Animal Crackers and Horse Feathers. Bit OR-ish without a source.       Finally, I think that 'Works referencing Duck Soup' could be viewed as trivia without sources, especially the Futurama one.  asyndeton   talk  00:53, 5 January 2008 (UTC)       FWIW, the film never gives a reason why Mrs. Teasdale wants Firefly to become Fredonia's leader -- she simply insists on it at the very beginning of the film. It's part of the film's premise, and isn't explained -- it's that kind of comedy. (This is true of most of the Marx Brothers' films. You either accept what's happening and go with the flow, to hilarious effect, or you don't. If the films spent any time trying to make sense or rationalize the characters behaviors, they wouldn't be nearly as funny as they are -- in fact, they might not be funny at all.)

Ed Fitzgerald (unfutz)   ( talk / cont )  02:27, 5 January 2008 (UTC)             Well, you could say that Mrs. Teasdale wants Firefly because he is, in her words, ""the most able statesman in all Freedonia."" I could go on, but that's a lead-in to a series of Groucho's insults, which reveal that she is, at best, naive about Firefly's value as a statesman. Which is also part of the humor. And Vera Marquel says she has heard that Mrs. Teasdale is ""sweet on this Firefly."" So she might be letting emotion get in the way of judgment. But as you indicate, it doesn't pay to over-analyze the plot. One word, often used to describe the Marxes themselves: ""Zany"".

I've been thinking of trimming down the ""famous scenes"" section, because, admittedly, a few of the selected scenes described in that section aren't necessarily famous. The ""mirror scene"", the ""climactic production number"", and the final battle scenes are, since most film scholars hail these as being the funniest moments in the film and since said scenes have been duplicated more than a few times afterward. However, things like that dialogue between Chico and the Prosecutor aren't exactly famous, and should probably go down as a footnote instead.

Some things:           Source  statements like ""Serious Sam II's gameplay consists almost entirely of the player attempting to defeat hundreds of enemies at a time, and thus is relatively simple"", ""A prominent feature in the previous  Serious Sam  games was  cooperative gameplay , in which multiple players could play the single-player campaign together.  Serious Sam II  focused on this game mode even more than its predecessors""   Reword  some awkward sentences, for example ""Player-controlled vehicles and turrets were introduced to the series in Serious Sam II, and examples include rocket launcher, machine gun, and laser turrets as well as hover bikes and hover saucers"", instead, ""SSII (or the game to avoid redundancy if needed) introduced player-controlled vehicles and turrets, allowing Sam to utilize rocket launchers as well as hover bikes""; ""This is a significant change from the previous games in the series in which the story existed merely to transport the player from place to place in order to kill as many enemies as possible in the process, with the plot consisting merely of messages that the player could disregard without consequence.""   Layout - I swapped around the sections (put development before reception) to conform with vg conventions. Also, consider adding a reviews table like {{ VG Reviews }} to the Reception section; this allows you to spend more time in the body talking about complaints and praise rather than raw scores from individual sections (see  Halo 3  for examples; usually only aggergate scores are mentioned in the main body.)         -- David Fuchs   ( talk )  19:46, 26 January 2008 (UTC)     [ edit ]   The Class   I've listed this article for peer review because it is an article which has, over the past few months, been widely expanded and is in need for a review.

Thanks,  J - tan Contribs User page  22:28, 22 December 2007 (UTC)     The easiest things to improve would be citation style and capitalisation (e.g. Modern  D evices) - use {{ citeweb }} tags in order to cite information from the internet, for example. Little things make all the difference to GA reviewers, and they'll not give your article the time of day unless there's nothing that could niggle at them. Ensure all citations go  after  punctuation, and make sure there's no doubly-punctuated citations ( cough  note 20  cough ). Similarly, why is ""candle clock"" bolded, yet nothing else is? I'd just give it a once-over with a fine-toothed comb before worrying about content.  Seegoon  ( talk ) 06:47, 23 December 2007 (UTC)    Does it look better now? GAN worthy?  J - tan Contribs User page  00:53, 2 January 2008 (UTC)           I'd call this article  History of timekeeping devices , not just of timekeeping. I remember in history we talked about the effects of being able to keep time in minutes in the 1800s changed society and how they perceived time. This article should include all of those aspects unless you want to make it solely about the devices. That's a scope issue. For what you have you need to reference the chronometer section and give everything more context. It's just descriptions of the devices and no real flow through the whole work or what led to research in new types of timekeeping devices, etc.  gren     06:06, 2 January 2008 (UTC)    I'd like it to be about timkeeping as a whole, including devices. Would you mind finding a source for those effects of keeping time in minutes? I would, but it's kind of a vague statement, and you know what you're talking about.  J - tan Contribs User page  16:52, 2 January 2008 (UTC)   Strongly agree with Grenavitar. The article is fine overview of the history of individual clocks, but despite an initial mention of calendars, entirely overlooks much of the history of human timekeeping.

Criticism, suggestions, general help or copy edits, anything will do. With some help from  User:Cirt  to get some references, and from several others who were nice enough to do some copy editing, I was able to get it to  WP:GA  status, and I think the article looks nice, but I feel that a peer review would do nicely before I nominate it. Thanks!  xihix ( talk )  00:13, 10 January 2008 (UTC)     I have glanced over it and will fully read it later. The main image has the caption ""The World Trade Center as seen in the episode.""; however, the WTC is off to the side of the picture and the Statue of Liberty is the dominant object. In the reception section, it says ""Ian Jones and Steve Williams greatly criticized the episode, claiming that it"", but I don't know who Jones and Williams are, nor can I find out as their names are not clickable. ""[]"" often begins quotes in the reception section. Why is this necessary? Good job on the article,  thedemonhog   talk    edits  07:06, 10 January 2008 (UTC)    The Ian Jones/Steve Williams citation is not really a very good source, I'd suggest removing it altogether. Instead, you could expand upon  Since the release of the season nine DVD box set, the episode has been highlighted out of the other episodes of the season by several newspaper reviewers.  - and actually highlight some of the newspaper reviews from these four sources that are just cited at the end of this sentence.  Cirt  ( talk ) 10:09, 10 January 2008 (UTC).         The Ian Jones/Steve Williams ones should stay in my opinion, as  Homer's Phobia , an FA that it recommended we use as a template to make articles, uses a quote from the two.  xihix ( talk )  23:37, 11 January 2008 (UTC)     I'm not saying that it should go.

Yes, I looked at Homer's Phobia and decided to just use that. Ok, moving on from this, I'd like more constructive criticism.  xihix ( talk )  00:21, 12 January 2008 (UTC)                   Note, requested feedback from relevant WikiProjects     I posted a notice about this peer review at  WP:TV ,  WP:NYC ,  WP:DOH ,  WP:COMEDY , and  WP:US-TOON . So hopefully you'll get some feedback from some some of those project members.  Cirt  ( talk ) 00:54, 12 January 2008 (UTC).     Saw the note over at  WP:US-TOON  and thought I'd offer my $0.02. Overall this looks very good, as I expected. I do have a few minor qualms with some wording which you might want to cleanup, I'll list what I can find but I'm not a very careful proofreader so I may have missed some. I highly recommend  User:Tony1/How_to_satisfy_Criterion_1a  to help spot some of these things as I have found it immensely helpful.           In the lead  He is also later successful in removing it,  could probably be  He is later successful in removing it,   In the first paragraph of the plot ""however"" is used in two consecutive sentences, which doesn't read fluidly for me.   Production:  Co-executive producer Bill Oakley decided to have the car parked in the plaza of the World Trade Center, which he had visited when construction was complete.  Perhaps I'm dense but it's not abundantly clear what construction is complete, I assume this was shortly after the towers were initially completed? Was the plaza built at a different time and he visited then? I'd consider rewording it for clarity.       I know those are a little picky and you may disagree, I'd recommend just checking for general wordiness throughout. I also have a personal preference to have the Reception section before the Cultural References but it's probably best to stick to the same formula used for the other FA eps. Also to comment on the above discussion, the Jones/Williams quote read as overly long to me. I thought the first sentence was the quote and that someone had inserted ""Homer discovered his car had been illegally parked between the two World Trade Centre buildings, and then spent the rest of the episode trying to get it back."" as some sort of vandalism until I read it more closely. I think it's important to show that not everyone loved the episode but maybe you could use just the first sentence and then explain that they were happy the episode is now rarely shown and that it was the worst season premier. That just seems like it would flow better to me but it's variable by individual style. Good luck!  Star dust 8212  01:51, 12 January 2008 (UTC)    Actually upon further review it seems that  Off the Telly  accepts reader submissions  [3] . I'm not sure if that makes it a RS or not, even if it IS used in Homer's Phobia.  Star dust 8212  02:05, 12 January 2008 (UTC)         Thanks for the help. I'll fix what you recommended. However, with the Ian Jones/Steve Williams thing, I do not believe that the submission means you get your story published or anything on the site. I really just needed the negative criticism, and I believe if it was already used on a great FA like Homer's Phobia, I might as well just use it.  xihix ( talk )  05:04, 12 January 2008 (UTC)     Review by  Phoenix-wiki Â ( talk Â     contribs )     The lead section is almost perfect. The ""Plot"" section could se a lot more references though, but apart from that it's good. I'd also like to see the ""Production"" section expanded. I  think  the ""Cultural references"" section can become a subsection of ""Reception"", though that's not essential. More refs always help, especially in the intro. Oh yeah, and the ""Further reading"" section shouldn't be a subsection of references. The best thing would be to make a level two ""Further reading"" with two level three subsections  ""Books"" and ""External link"".-- Phoenix - wiki  17:42, 13 January 2008 (UTC)     Well, a few things. Plot sections often don't really even need references, but I added two anyway. There's not much to expand in the Production section, as everything that was available is pretty much there. I don't really see how Cultural References would make sense in the Reception.... Also, I don't see how more references would be necessary, when everything is already referenced. And, references in lead are usually a no-no, as whatever is in the lead is usually in the rest of the prose.

Here's a suggestion:  Wikipedia:WikiProject Cities#Article structure guidelines  links to article structure guidelines for UK and US cities. Both call for a geography section. The Japanese Wikipedia has some relevant material. Since the article mentions several features including the castle, mountain, Gifu Station, and some ch by name, a map would help readers conceptualize the layout.    I've added a geography section and a demographics section. (I haven't been able to come up with a map with suitable licensing, but I'm still looking.)

I've done some similar changes and suggest these.       In the Lifestyle section, the information on Gifu City Tower needs to be updated. It's referenced, so either a new reference will be necessary, or the present one will have to be removed, unless you can alter the sentence to separate the pre- and post-opening information.       A number of topics are discussed in two places. Slow life, Gifu City Tower, and the fashion industry rivaling Tokyo and Osaka are all covered twice. Once should be good.       Saito Dosan's name appears both with and without macrons. That'll be easy to fix. Jozai-ji too.       The sentence ""In the aromatic garden, you can enjoy tea and traditional foods."" is in the second person;  WP:MoS  requires the third person.       These are minor matters. The article is quite nice already.  Fg2  ( talk ) 11:38, 11 January 2008 (UTC)    Thanks for compliments and advice.

By the way, the  Scholastic wrestling  article has been resurrected, mainly because the High School section grew too long for this page. Nevertheless,  Scholastic wrestling  makes for a great ""companion article"" in my opinion, and I hope any changes in terms of writing style and such will be carried over to the  Scholastic wrestling  article as well, except where high school and middle school wrestling differs officially from its college counterpart.

Ruhrfisch   ><>    02:54, 5 January 2008 (UTC)       [ edit ]   History of collegiate wrestling   I've listed this article for peer review because   I've just created this article fairly recently (after the History section on the  Collegiate wrestling  page had been taking up loads of kilobytes) and have been editing this article either signed in or logged off on my own or at a public computer for some time now. Even though I'm not a wrestler, I've tried to make sure that this article is accurate and consistent with the sources I've been able to find. Please check behind me, and correct and improve not only this article, but also the History sections on the  Collegiate wrestling  and  Scholastic wrestling  pages where approrpiate. I'm mainly interested in improvements to all of the sections for accuracy and detail, as well as in improving/correcting redundancies, spelling errors, and grammatical errors. Could someone also please consilidate repeated source references when appropriate?   There has been a question that has been on my mind for some time. In the section on the 20th century, I've pointed out that the first college dual meet took place between Yale and UPenn in 1900. I've cited the sources I found that information from appropriately. Other sources, such as the article on this website at  http://www.ivyleaguesports.com/article.asp?intID=2084 , point out that the first college dual meet took place between Yale and Columbia in 1903. Is one right and the other wrong, or could both events be added to the article and clarified somehow?   Could someone please also add accurate and cited information regarding the development of American wrestling at the high school level?   I would also like to find out if people think the writing style of the article is clear, sufficient, and comprehensive enough (without being too burdensome to read) for the average reader. Other changes are also welcome that will improve the article. I would like to know if this article is at least B class. I would like to see this article become a Good Article, if not an A Class or a Featured article in the near future.

I'd like to see some more context and background given on the subject which would be interesting to the reader without extensive knowledge of Greek history (for example, what significance does the Pelasgians being considered Greek have?). See  WP Lead .   The word choice seems inaccessible to the average reader--example: does ""autochthonous"" have to used? (see last sentence, second paragraph).   Additionally, the article could use some copy-editing, which I would love to do, however I feel that I do not know enough about the subject to do so without substantially altering the meaning.   Maybe some more images could be found?   Some sources are cited parenthetically (example:  (fragment 225) ) whilst others are footnotes. It would be easier to read if they were all footnotes.   I would love to see some more context given -- for example: when discussing ""Isocrates"", I would like to know his significance so I would be better equipped to analyze the quote of his provided from Panegyric 23-5. To me, this is the largest area in which the article could be expanded. As it stands, the text is difficult for someone without intimate knowledge of Greek history to comprehend. Here are some further examples:           Strabo quotes Hesiod as expanding on the Homeric phrase, calling Dodona ""seat of Pelasgians"" (fragment 225); he speaks also of the eponymous ancestor of the Pelasgians, Pelasgus (Ancient Greek: ), the father of the culture-hero of Arcadia, Lycaon.  I had to look up the word ""eponymous"", additionally it is unclear what significance these facts have to the topic.   Herodotus, like Homer, has a denotative as well as a connotative use.  As the reader, I am interested in what this means and its significance to the topic.         Overall, the article seems to be full of good information but could benefit from being edited into an easier to read style.

Thanks, -- BrownHairedGirl   (talk)   ( contribs )  20:30, 28 December 2007 (UTC)     Just a few comments on this one:    ""Easington"" is mislinked to a disambig page in the lead   The referenced material in the lead should be incorporated in the text (which much of it seems to be) and the lead then re-written as a multi-paragraph summary.   There is a lack of balance in the article. It's about a man called ""Jack Dormand"" but, rather than being written about him, the article is largely about his political career from when he turned 50. There is very little about the first 1/2 century of his life. The article seems to note that he trained as a teacher, stopped teaching but no note on the teaching work he did in the middle(just an example of missing material)   The ""Family"" section is far too short in proportion to the rest of the article - perhaps incorporate into the ""Early Life"" and rename this section.   Over-wikilinking. 1970, 1981 and 1987 in the infobox need not be linked.  House of commons ,  Easington ,  Maggie thatcher  are linked twice  Chair of the parlimentary labour party  and his constituancy thrice and there are quite a few more.   ""Despite his age, he remained physically active."" - ouchÂ ! at the time he setup the Gym he was in his 50's - hardly old, decrepit or of a notable age. Perhaps just note that he remained physically active until (age) at leastÂ ?       Quite few text issues (I'm a poor one to find these - need a better copyeditor)- picked a few that stood out for me. Needs some strong copyediting    ""In the 1970s, he had opposed left-wing infiltration into the Labour Party,[2] and in foreign affairs, he was pro-American and pro-NATO[11] at a time when the party's left-wing was becoming increasingly hostile to both."" - reads much better as ""In the 1970s, he opposed left-wing infiltration of the Labour Party.[2] He was pro-American and pro-NATO, at a time when the party's left-wing was increasingly hostile to both.[11]"" then there are not references in the middle of the sentence, the two ideas are split in two and some redundancy removed.   ""Despite the left's strength at the time, when stood for election in October 1981 as Chair of the Parliamentary Labour Party, supported by the centre-Right Manifesto Group of Labour MPs, he defeated the left-winger Ian Mikardo by 102 votes to 65, and Mikardo then withdrew"" is convoluted and clunky. - try           ""He stood for election in October 1981 as Chair of the Parliamentary Labour Party, supported by the centre-Right Manifesto Group of Labour MPs. Despite the left's strength at the time he defeated their candidate Ian Mikardo by 102 votes to 65, causing Mikardo to withdraw.""           ""Dormand was born near Easington at the workingmen's club in the village of Haswell, when his father Bernard, a former miner, was steward"" - he was born at the clubÂ ?   ""Although he later took up rugby"" - gives one the impression that rugby and football are in some way mutually exclusive. Just present the rugby as a separate sentence unless there is some need to connect it to football here.   ""However, once in the Lords he thrived, serving on numerous select committees, including education, trade and industry, and the liaison and procedure committees."" ->           ""He thrived in the Lords, serving on select committees including education, trade and industry, and liaison and procedures."" Shorter, removes the needless ""However"" as this is clear to a reader and ""numerous"" is pointless as then a number of committees are listed.           ""When Labour lost the 1979 general election, Dormand served for two years as an opposition whip."" -> ""Dormand was opposition whip for two years after Labour's loss in the 1979 general election."" Puts the main idea at the beginning.       The prose needs work beyond copyediting:    There are a few excessively long sentences that often try to connect two completely different things that should be separated eg: ""He recovered from a double heart bypass in 2001, and received an honorary doctorate of letters in July 2003 from Loughborough University"" - The operation and the hon-doc do not need to be connected.   Short paragraphs (particularly the one and two sentence ones) should be connected into longer ones that have a common theme       -  Peripitus   (Talk)  12:51, 29 December 2007 (UTC)       A script has been used to generate a semi- automated  review of the article for issues relating to grammar and  house  style.

It has a potential to be nominated for  Good article  status but first a peer review should be done.    Thanks,   Padmanii  ( talk ) 06:28, 28 December 2007 (UTC)     [ edit ]   Review by  Puchiko   Overall, the article is pleasant reading, and a GA should be possible with minor corrections.     References -I can't stress this one enough. You must get rid of the ugly  [ citation needed ]  next to the Australia population and in the orgins section. In general, try to add more references.   The lead could use some expansion.   What's the plural of Hazara? I have seen both ""Hazara"" and ""Hazaras"" used within the article. In my suggested rewordings, I have put ""s"" in brackets. You should probably find out what's correct before applying these changes.   One sentence paragraphs are generally discouraged. Eliminate/expand/merge the Etymology section. The information is clearly important, and must stay, but it can't have its own section unless you can write a full paragraph about it.   One theory states that the Hazara have Mongolian origins...  To  WP:Avoid weasel words , you should probably use  According to ______________ Hazara(s) are of Mongolian origins...  In summary, make clear who is making that claim. Same goes for  It is commonly believed that the Hazara are descendants of the armies and settlers of Genghis Khan's Mongolians...  and  Some sources say he drove out the Uzbeks...   This chromosome is virtually absent outside the limits of the Mongol Empire except among the Hazara people, where it reaches its highest frequency anywhere.  Sounds awkward.   Put the whole modern history section into the past tense. You should also recheck the neutrality of the section.   Many young Hazara are studying in developed countries such as Australia, legally through education or work visas.  Should probably be  Many young Hazara(s) are studying in developed countries, such as Australia, legally, through education or work visas.  Not sure though. Also, a source would be nice.   There are many Afghanistani Hazara who have migrated to developed countries especially in Australia as refugees.  should probably be:  Many Afghanistani Hazara(s) have migrated to developed countries, especially to Australia, as refugees.  Also, it should probably be sourced.   In Pakistan most of the Hazaras live in and around the city of Quetta and hold high positions in the government of Balochistan.  In its current state, the sentence says that most Pakistani Hazara(s) hold high postions in the Balochistan goverment. Try rewording this to make its original meaning clearer. Again, include a source.   In Pakistan, Hazaras are mostly in business and have high education levels.  Try:  Most Hazaras in Pakistan work in business, and are highly educated.  And a source would be great.   The sections ""Religion"" and ""Hazara tribes"" are extremely short. Try expanding them, or merging them into other sections.     Honestly, the article is a fine one. It has some problems with grammar and references, but it contains all the necessary information. Great work!

It's comprehensive, balanced, well-illustrated, focused. I did some minor copy-editing. Below are the only things that popped out at me:     Television > Lizzie Mcguire:  The Lizzie Mcguire Movie  raked in $42.6 million at the US box office[12] and received mixed reviews with certain critics calling it, ""an unabashed promotion of Duffs image, just as Crossroads was for Spears"",[13] while other reviews were generally positive and encouraging.[14][15][16] Y   Done Gprince007  ( talk ) 15:39, 28 December 2007 (UTC)   Film career > 2003-2004: Afterwards, Duff reprised her role as Lizzie McGuire for  The Lizzie McGuire Movie , which exceeded box office expectations earning $55,534,455 worldwide.[20]    It's really not necessary to split this up. #1 should be cut and merged with #2. What's left in the Lizzie Mcguire section will be sufficient. Y   Done Gprince007  ( talk ) 15:39, 28 December 2007 (UTC)   ""raked in"" is editorial. Change to more encyclopedic wording. Y   Done Gprince007  ( talk ) 15:39, 28 December 2007 (UTC)   The two amounts differ. $42.6 or $55.5? Clarify, please. Y   Done Gprince007  ( talk ) 15:39, 28 December 2007 (UTC)       Music career > 2002-2004: The video for ""Our Lips Are Sealed"" was popular on MTV's Total Request Live, but the song failed to chart on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.    Did it chart in the U.S. at all? If not, just say that. This goes for any such wording in the article. Hot 100 is not the only U.S. chart, so it can be confusing.       She described the album as more personal and having a rock feel than Metamorphosis.    This doesn't read quite right. Y   Done Gprince007  ( talk ) 16:04, 28 December 2007 (UTC)       Personal life: In August 2005, Duff said she received veneers because she chipped off one of her front teeth on a microphone during a concert.[77] She subsequently had her veneers redone to match the size of her original teeth.    Why is that relevant?         Good luck with the FA nom. Regards,  Lara  Love  19:23, 26 December 2007 (UTC)         Well i guess i've addressed the major issues raised in the peer review. The following are the issues which i couldnt address alongwith reasons:           Pt. 3...many cites and sources are available which indicate that the song charted only in Australia. That means it didnt chart in US. But as far as my knowledge goes, drawing ur own conclusion or inference amounts to ""Original Reasearch"" ,so i think the sentence shd be left as it is.If i find a cite which states it clearly that it didnt chart in US , then i'll reword it as suggested in the peer review.   Pt 5... the veneer incident is cited but i am not sure abt its notability. A search on the internet revealed that  Contact music ,  people  magazine and  life and style  magazine have covered the veneer treatment. Also hilary duff's comment that she kept chipping her teeth on the microphone makes somewhat notable point. Anyways i have expanded the veneer incident in the article alongwith Duff's comment and its cited. But i'm still doubtful about its notability. But still i guess it shd remain as long as its ok or it doesnt hinder FA candidature.     Thanx for the review....any other suggestions are welcome.

Also throughout the article there are multiple single sentences. These shouldn't stand alone and should either be expanded or merged into another paragraph. For the inline citations, consider using the citation templates at  WP:CITET , as you can then include information about the website, title, author, access date, etc. It will make the references easier to read, but if you haven't used the templates before, I'd recommend practicing with them a bit and previewing a lot before saving.

I haven't much time on Wikipedia today, what with the Bowl games and all, so here's a couple of brief thoughts:     For  Princess Leia Organa , I think that there is plenty of room for improvement. One important thing to remember is that this is an encyclopedia grounded in real-world context. Thus, in-universe information should be downplayed and used to complement the real-world context of the character. I would suggest reviewing  WP:FICTION  if you haven't already. Also, I would recommend the character articles  Jason Voorhees  and  Captain Jack Sparrow  (good works by editors I know) to serve as guides. You can ask them for advice, too. My thought for this particular character is to find out about its conception, like how Lucas came up with the character and why he designed her the way he did. Also look at how the character has been publicly received. I imagine that there's probably some commentary on the sibling kiss and perhaps some feminist studies about her, since she seems to be a major female icon. She's also been in quite a number of  Star Wars  books since the original trilogy, so you could look at how reviewers have criticized different authors' portrayal of the character. Perhaps one author wrote her as independent and another one wrote her as clingy. This would definitely be a big project, encompassing films and books and probably more. Like I said about  Duck Soup , offline resources may need to be involved. Nobody said editing was easy.Â :)     If you have any questions at all, feel free to ask!

Just add a load of inline citations to confirm her story, and afterwards check the writing to be sure everything is clear and organized into coherent paragraphs. Also, I see that the picture of Leia in the Bikini is 350px! I know she's beautiful, but that might be a bit big. Usually, MoS asks that image size fields be left blank. Users can pick how big they want images to be by tinkering with the own preferences. On smaller-resolution monitors, the Leia bikini picture would take up half the screen!  Wrad  ( talk ) 20:38, 1 January 2008 (UTC)         Cinemaniac replies:  Sorry about the Leia ""bikini"" pic's size. At  the talk page , though, I can recall consensus being reached that 350 px was fine to illustrate the image. I'll go ahead and shrink the image anyway, just in case. And thanks for your comments.   Cinemaniac   ( talk    contribs )  22:05, 1 January 2008 (UTC)    Huh. That discussion seems to have a consensus for shrinking it to 150px. I wouldn't even agree with that.

It should be retitled Appearance, which seems to be the standard. The early life should be removed. The expanded universe should be greatly compressed. ""The Truce at Bakura"", not important. Her marriage to Han Solo, important. You have to make decisions like that. That's priority number 1 to me. The sheer length makes me want to skip the article completely and move on to something else.  ColdFusion650  ( talk ) 00:33, 2 January 2008 (UTC)     Cinemaniac replies:  Yeah, I agree the article is rather lengthy. The various subsections of the Expanded Universe section should probably be compressed to the size of the pre-Expanded Universe section: One-to-three paragraphs each. That'd probably help trim it down. The article also really drags on in those sections; again, undoubtedly because of length and somewhat rambling prose. I'll do my best to correct that.

I could add a story to fanfiction.net saying the gold bikini was melted down and used by Vader as a prosthetic limb, but that wouldn't justify the inclusion of this viewpoint in the article. I note that you have a second (more credible?) source to back up the fanfiction story. Could you post it here for further discussion? Without it I would argue the ""Leia had sex with Solo while wearing Jabba's bikini"" sentence should be removed from the article.

The whole Expanded Universe subsection is in need of referencing, and a little more summarization would be good. It does mention some of the books from which the information is drawn, but it can be more specific than that. Check out  John-117  and you'll see what I mean.   Make mention somewhere of what ABY means, since the average reader probably won't know that it means After the Battle of Yavin.   Props for pointing out the plothole about how she remembers stuff about her mother.   When the section about her Appearances draws to a close, wrap it up with something akin to a ""last known whereabouts."" Describe what she was doing and what was going on in the latest part of the extended universe, if you know what I mean. (Like with John-117: at the end of  Halo 3 , he is in the wreckage of a spacecraft and enters cryonic sleep. That's the last thing that is known to have happened to him, in the Halo universe.)     Once the referencing and summarization issues are addressed, I think that the only thing between this article and a GA review would be a general copyedit. It's lookin' good.

It is almost entirely plot summary, with only one section of real world info that would benefit from a renaming, as well as a great deal of expansion. I'm not a Star Wars fan by any stretch, but I'm pretty certain Princess Leia has a lot more real world notability than just her bikini and hair do that would fill the article up much better. How did she influence society? At the time the movies first came out, did her characterization have any affects in the movie industry's depiction of women or with female audiences? The entire plot section needs a great deal of shortening up and summarizing. For a fan, I'm sure it is a useful amount of detail, but I think it would fit better in the Star Wars wikia than as the bulk of an encyclopedic article about this character. The article is also in need of better sources for some stuff. It seems like most of the bikini info is sourced from a fan site for the bikini and a few other sources look a little questionable. The first half of information on the hair style is unsourced at all and needs a wee bit of tone adjustment. As a whole, I'm seeing too many primarily sources and not enough outside sources to establish her notability apart from the films, when even a non-fan like me knows she has someÂ ;-)  Collectonian  ( talk ) 09:05, 2 January 2008 (UTC)         Cinemaniac replies:  Yeah, I'm trying to research more third-party sources on the character.

Try a universal format for citations. The Bikini section also seems a little long still. Check out the other SW GAs and FAs like  Palpatine  to get some more ideas.  Darth Griz98  23:42, 2 January 2008 (UTC)         Cinemaniac replies:  Thanks for taking time from your  wikibreak  to respond to my request for peer review. As I'm sure you know, distinguishing fact from fanboyish-fiction isn't always easy, as you can tell by clicking  here . As that discussion shows, my initial reason for editing this article was nothing more than piqued curiosity concerning the famous outfit. It's fascinating, because this article was always getting  fandalized  for this very reason; in fact, it's probably experienced more  fancruft  explosion than any other  Star Wars  article. Fortunately, with the addition of  that ""Metal Bikini"" section  to the article, most of that vandalism has come to a halt. Also, although most of them were limited to the two sections of the article I created, in-line citations are being steadily added to the other sections, so I hope that helps.

As long as it keeps true to the story, keeps true to the real history behind it, and brief enough with lots of sources, I really don't have a problem with the Bikini section.

Euryalus ,  Evula  and I had to clean up all the soft-core erotic  fanfic  that IPs kept on inserting into the article.

To be honest I think that the way the 'first kiss' passage is phrased is a perfect example of the overarching problem with this article - that it's far too casual. The article gives a complete summary of the films from Leia's perspective. I'm not sure that chronicling every one of Leia's appearances is the best way to describe her character. If it is, then they should be far more succinct and far less informal.  David ovic  05:16, 5 January 2008 (UTC)         Cinemaniac replies : You're right; Leia's first kiss (on film, at the least) was with Luke, depicted in  The Empire Strikes Back . The most obvious reason for this is because of the natural attraction that Leia had to both Han and Luke (and vice versa), and the tension resulting among them because of this. If I remember correctly, she kissed Luke because an argument broke out between her and Han, and it was possibly done to make Han jealous. Han and Leia wouldn't kiss each other until later in the film. Remember, it wasn't until  Return of the Jedi  that Leia was revealed as being Luke's sister. I'll try to edit this 'first kiss' passage to make it more succinct. Thanks for the comment.

I nominated it for FAC in November, but de-nominated it after a few days. It has changed quite a bit since its GA pass. I feel now with the additions I made to it for the initial FAC that it's cumbersome at 78k, though as thorough as possible.     The book is unique: it has been read by the majority of the English-speaking world and rates very highly on books of impact and importance, but lacks a large body of study outside of the legal and education fields. What has been written in these fields is primarily a study on its impact of the legal profession and guides on how to teach it.   On images: Harper Lee despises having her photo taken. She had some shots taken of her when the book was released, but there are no public domain photos of her. At one point, I had screen stills from the film, but they were taken out by another editor. What is the recommendation for including only book covers?     Your input is appreciated. -- Moni3  ( talk ) 18:51, 29 December 2007 (UTC)     Comments from  Hadseys  -- the article is very good however, a few things I've noticed is that       the table of contents does seem to be rather large, is there a way too condense it perhaps?

I'm asking for assistance in what to cut out, if anything. I have read all the featured article novels, and used them as guides in writing this article. But there is a point where  TKaM  becomes its own article, apart from the others. Because of the far-reaching impact this book has had, that it is Harper Lee's only novel and she is somewhat enigmatic about it, and because the film and play are so closely related to the book, the lore involving the novel is extensive. Unlike the  Lord of the Rings  trilogy, unfortunately, the subject doesn't lend itself into neater divisions as a trilogy does. -- Moni3  ( talk ) 18:38, 30 December 2007 (UTC)       the images tend to be concentrated towards the latter parts of the article, perhaps more images of life in America at the time may help to provide more context for readers     Other than that, a very well article that is extensively referenced, very comprehensive and very well written. Kudos -- Hadseys  ( talk    contribs ) 00:55, 30 December 2007 (UTC)     I'll consider these ideas for images. Thank you for your comments. -- Moni3  ( talk ) 18:38, 30 December 2007 (UTC)     I did some work on this article about a year ago. Much good work has been done since then. Here's my two-cents. Not for nothing, but I think that under 'Reception' both the impact on legal profession and race relation sections are places which should be trimmed. I think it would make more sense to place the impact on legal profession in the  Atticus Finch  article, as 99% of it revolves around him. Also, include a link to Atticus under 'See also.' Furthermore, I would remove the impact on race relation section altogether. Although I hate to do this for 2 reasons. 1) It removes your hard work 2) Implies that I'm racially insensitive--I think that this is a tenuous connection anyhow. It states as much in the article:     ""The novel's release is so closely associated with the Civil Rights movement, many analyses of the book and biographies of Harper Lee include important moments in the movement, despite the fact that she had no direct involvement in any of them.""     That's all for now. Good Luck.  Preceding  unsigned  comment added by  66.67.114.119  ( talk ) 03:15, 3 January 2008 (UTC)         Yes, trimming parts to an article one has worked hard on to scour sources is difficult and I do it with some reservation. I will link to Atticus Finch - you are right to point that out. However, since the majority of written material on the novel is about Atticus in the legal profession, I thought it appropriate to give that material weight in the article. I have to think about that.               The second point is also difficult for me to consider. The novel's first impact was on race relations. Even though it is seen as a bit outdated for many in the field of race relations, in the context of its history, it was quite influential. I have to admit I don't understand your point about the tenuous connection. Are you saying it's not strong enough to be included in the article?               I appreciate your comments and feedback. -- Moni3  ( talk ) 03:45, 3 January 2008 (UTC)                   Regarding Atticus, I think there is a certain point where one article becomes too long and needs to separate. I think this is normal and a good thing. Take for instance a honey bee hive, they get too big and one queen bee leaves the other with a bunch of other bees. When I read the legal profession section, all I see it being about is Atticus. This makes a fortunate breaking point as you can pretty much cut/paste it into the Atticus article. I wouldn't be surprised if someone at a later date makes Atticus a FA--he's certainly notable enough. Now in regards to the race relation and tenuous connection, first you place emphasis on the children in the movie. This almost seems as though it could go in the article on the film. I suppose my main argument with the tenuous nature of the material is that I have a problem with emphasizing an impact that isn't necessarily the main focus of the book. As far as I can tell Lee didn't write it as a civil rights movement book, per se. As noted above in the article, the gay community has found resonance in TKAM. However, just because a group finds resonance doesn't necessarily mean one must include a considerable section on it. Granted, this may be a weak argument on my part.                       One other section that I think you should take a second look at is the Style section. I'm typically not too big of a fan of the Style/Themes sections of articles on books, simply because I think they tend to read into aspects of the book way too far and are more interpretative. However, I think the Theme section is well done in this article and should be left. I think the style could be trimmed back. I'm not sure that sections devoted to irony, parody, satire, and legal allusions are needed. I think that if you cut these back it would be a good place to trim the article. Additionally, it would solve a little bit of the problem with that insanely large table of contents. One thing I would like to mention however is that I think it is good to keep that legal allusion with the opening quote. I think that is significant, albeit interpretative. Best Wishes.

J Milburn  ( talk ) 11:48, 5 January 2008 (UTC)           [ edit ]   Boydell Shakespeare Gallery   Rupert Clayton  and  Awadewit  have been working on this little article about an interesting eighteenth-century Shakespeare venture for a couple of months now. They are planning on taking it to FAC soon and would like help polishing and revising it. Thanks in advance!  Awadewit  |  talk  00:20, 12 January 2008 (UTC)   Review by Scartol   To begin with: The use of third-person objective in the lead to this peer review is entirely inappropriate and shows evidence of hideous moral upbringing, as well as insipidly substandard prose. It must be revised immediately without discussion or question.   Seriously, though, this article is  as always for Awad's work  well-written and comprehensive in the extreme.   Lead     I'd like to see some mention in the first sentence of how the gallery was a collection of pictures. (This might seem obvious, but the ""also included"" clause later in the lead made me say: ""Wait, what?"")           These opening sentences have continued to pose problems. New opening paragraph:  The Boydell Shakespeare Gallery was a collection of pictures commissioned by eighteenth-century engraver and publisher John Boydell in an effort to foster a school of British history painting. In November 1786, he initiated the project, which also included an illustrated edition of Shakespeare's works and a folio of prints from the London gallery.   Awadewit  |  talk  05:37, 15 January 2008 (UTC)           Much better. Â  Scartol Â Â  Tok  18:19, 15 January 2008 (UTC)               Maybe the above could be remedied along with my next gripe: the split clause ""He initiated the enterprise  in November 1786 in London."" How about: ""He initiated the enterprise in November 1786 in London by bringing together""?           Revised.  Awadewit  |  talk  05:37, 15 January 2008 (UTC)           How would you feel about changing that ""enterprise"" to ""project""? Enterprise feels so still and formal.           Revised.  Awadewit  |  talk  05:37, 15 January 2008 (UTC)           ""and their productions"" in the second lead paragraph feels unnecessary (especially in a sentence with a number of phrase-tendrils).           Do you have another suggestion? The sentence is supposed to mean paintings of the plays and of their theatrical productions - these were both important elements and both receive treatment in the article itself.  Awadewit  |  talk  05:41, 15 January 2008 (UTC)           Yeah, I see what you mean. I wonder putting the predicate at the end of the sentence is in part responsible for its awkwardness. How about: ""Shakespeare enjoyed new popularity in 18th-century Britain when several new Shakespeare editions were published; his plays were revived in the theatre; and the numerous works of art were created illustrating his plays and productions of them.""? Â  Scartol Â Â  Tok  18:19, 15 January 2008 (UTC)           I like it. Replaced.  Awadewit  |  talk  08:22, 16 January 2008 (UTC)                   How about changing ""beginning in 1791 and ending in 1803"" to simply ""from 1791 to 1803""?           Done.  Awadewit  |  talk  05:41, 15 January 2008 (UTC)           ""the original paintings of edition's plates""  either I'm dense (which is possible) or this is a confusing phrase.           It is and I've struggled to find a better one - thoughts? (There is supposed to be a ""the"" in there, but that is not the problem.)  Awadewit  |  talk  05:41, 15 January 2008 (UTC)           I can't find this phrase anymore (and somehow I've forgotten what it was attached to). Was it (re)moved? Â  Scartol Â Â  Tok  18:19, 15 January 2008 (UTC)           I took it out - that detail seemed unimportant for the lead.  Awadewit  |  talk  08:22, 16 January 2008 (UTC)                   ""and the folio of engravings he published""  would ""his folio of engravings"" be incorrect? That sentence just feels full.           That version starts to sound like he did the engravings, don't you think? If you don't think so, I'll gladly change it.  Awadewit  |  talk  05:41, 15 January 2008 (UTC)           No, you're right. I guess the current wording is best. Â  Scartol Â Â  Tok  18:19, 15 January 2008 (UTC)               However, the long delay in publishing the prints and the illustrated edition prompted criticism. The final products of Boydell's ventures were not judged favourably: they were hurried and many illustrations had been done by lesser artists.  Was the criticism of the first sentence here related to  or the same as  the unfavorable judgments of the second? If so, do they need to be separate sentences? If not, I'd like to see a transition word or phrase. (""were likewise not judged favorably"")           Added a ""therefore"".  Awadewit  |  talk  05:46, 15 January 2008 (UTC)         Shakespeare in the 18th century     Boydell tapped into a rich market that many others, such as actor and producer David Garrick, were also exploiting.  I'd like to see a noun complementing ""others"", as in ""other entrepreneurs"" or ""other investors"" or some such. Also, I wonder if the ""also"" is needed  insofar as we're setting up a background into which Boydell entered? (I think of ""also""s as being most useful when the events are happening simultaneously.) Now that I re-read the sentence, though, it seems to fit. Your call.           Added ""entrepreneurs""; left in ""also"" (they were exploiting it simultaneously, I think).  Awadewit  |  talk  05:46, 15 January 2008 (UTC)           Man, I wish we could left-margin those blockquotes when there's an image. I've asked in the IRC channel and I'm trying to find an answer as I type.           UPDATE: Okay, we found a way to jam in some extra CSS code to give us the left margin back. The important thing is that it's dependent on the image; if that moves or changes size, then the margin will look very odd. So  leave it alone!!  =) Â  Scartol Â Â  Tok  01:19, 14 January 2008 (UTC)           No touchy.Â :) (Why is that so hard to achieve?)  Awadewit  |  talk  05:46, 15 January 2008 (UTC)           I'm glad you asked, because I love to explain technical nerd stuff. It works like this: The <blockquote> tag tells the MediaWiki software: ""The following words need a left-margin of 10 pixels"". (Numbers are approximate.) However, when an image appears on the left, the MediaWiki software already says to itself (because of an evil bit of code known as the <div> tag): ""Space that text over the width of the picture, plus a margin of 5 pixels."" So in the case of this example, Let's say the image is 285 pixels wide, plus 5 for the margin. When the 10 pixel margin is demanded by the <blockquote> tag, MediaWiki says: ""No sweat! It's already over 290 pixels. All taken care of."" (And such a thing is not additive.)   The problem is that this is also the same left-margin as all the other text, so the block quote has no relative left margin. Therefore, it's necessary to say ""No matter how much of a margin you might otherwise apply, indent this block 300 pixels"", which gives us the 290 we'd normally have, plus the extra 10 we need to make it look like a real blockquote. Voil! (The person who helped me figure this out  I almost fixed it by myself but like a moron I was using the wrong word for the CSS code  provided me with a snappy diagram he somehow generated of the various elements involved, but I didn't save the URL and don't know how to generate them. I'll see if I can find it.) Â  Scartol Â Â  Tok  18:19, 15 January 2008 (UTC)           We should disseminate this solution somehow, because it is a widespread problem.  Awadewit  |  talk  08:22, 16 January 2008 (UTC)           I just got done telling my 4th hour Creative Writing class about it, but they seemed disinterested. Maybe there's another avenue?  Signpost ?  WikWeekly ? Â  Scartol Â Â  Tok  18:38, 16 January 2008 (UTC)           Definitely the Signpost - they have a new section on tutorials.Â :)  Awadewit  |  talk  20:10, 16 January 2008 (UTC)                               Not sure why ""literary pictures"" and ""conversation pieces"" are italicized.           They are terms - too confusing?  Awadewit  |  talk  05:46, 15 January 2008 (UTC)           Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems therefore like the article refers to them as phrases that were used in a particular way by the folks involved. My impulse, then, is to use quotation marks, a la  neutral-distance scare quotes . Â  Scartol Â Â  Tok  18:19, 15 January 2008 (UTC)           They are art-historical terms. I don't think scare quotes are appropriate, since no distancing is needed. Either italicize or do nothing, in my opinion. (Scare quotes in the humanities often indicate that the word being quoted doesn't mean what you think it means. I don't want to indicate that here.)  Awadewit  |  talk  08:22, 16 January 2008 (UTC)           See, I don't necessarily have that association. Many times they are used that way in my experience, but sometimes I see them used (perhaps erroneously) to substitute for the phrase ""what some people referred to as"". Your call. Â  Scartol Â Â  Tok  18:38, 16 January 2008 (UTC)           Removed. Just unnecessary, I think.  Awadewit  |  talk  20:10, 16 January 2008 (UTC)                           I'd prefer a word or two about what the Royal Academy exhibitions actually exhibited. Also, how about a different phrasing on the second instance, to break up the repetition of: ""attained its peak in the Royal Academy exhibitions. The Academy exhibitions became an important public event""           Revised:  This tradition began with William Hogarth (whose prints reached multiple strata of society) and attained its peak in the Royal Academy exhibitions, which displayed paintings, drawings, and sculptures. The exhibitions became an important public event: thousands of spectators flocked to see them each year and newspapers carried detailed reports and critiques of the works displayed.   Awadewit  |  talk  07:00, 15 January 2008 (UTC)           Excellent . Â  Scartol Â Â  Tok  18:19, 15 January 2008 (UTC)             Sorry to stop in the middle of a section, but I've got a conference call I need to join. More to come! Â  Scartol Â Â  Tok  23:48, 13 January 2008 (UTC)   Okay, let's see how well I can peer-review while listening with one ear to the call.     The parenthetical phrase ""as would Boydell's Shakespeare Gallery, later in the century"" uses the conditional past  I don't care for it in general, and here it seems like ""as did Boydell's"" would be more efficient.           Changed.  Awadewit  |  talk  07:00, 15 January 2008 (UTC)           the public was introduced to the works of Shakespeare.  Hadn't they been introduced when the plays were performed back in the day? Maybe ""introduced anew"" or some such? Especially when the first sentence of the paragraph talks about ""expanding Shakespeare's popular appeal"". This dilemma continues into the next paragraph.           Changed to ""re-introduced"".  Awadewit  |  talk  07:00, 15 January 2008 (UTC)           I know I'm really splitting hairs here, and I apologize if this is too microscopic:  it was the mid-century Shakespearean theatrical revival that was probably most responsible  A simpler phrasing would be: ""the mid-century  revival was probably most responsible"" Cutting out the ""it was"" phrasing would make it read more smoothly.           Yes, that is better - not splitting hairs at all.  Awadewit  |  talk  07:00, 15 January 2008 (UTC)           I'm sure that ""superb acting, unrivalled productions"" is representing the majority of critical opinion, but I wonder if we still need less POV words?           Actually, this does represent the sources, both modern and historical. Garrick was a celebrity and people thought he was the best thing since sliced bread. That reputation has lasted. I am hesitant to change the description because this, surprisingly, reflects both primary and secondary sources.  Awadewit  |  talk  07:00, 15 January 2008 (UTC)           Okay, but shouldn't we have ""what critics called"" or some similar phrase? Or  even better  a direct quotation? Â  Scartol Â Â  Tok  18:19, 15 January 2008 (UTC)           Added the critics bit. I don't want to start adding quotations. This is not an article about Garrick.Â :)  Awadewit  |  talk  08:22, 16 January 2008 (UTC)           Fair enough. (Makes a mental note to watch for article by Awad about Garrick at FAC two months from now.) Â  Scartol Â Â  Tok  18:38, 16 January 2008 (UTC)                       Not sure how much the sentence ""Garrick became the 18th-century embodiment of Shakespeare."" adds to the paragraph. It seems to be expressed by the other elements.           Removed.  Awadewit  |  talk  07:00, 15 January 2008 (UTC)           Sometimes ""18th century"" is hyphenated, and sometimes it's not. Seems like it ought to be one way or the other.           Um, it's hyphenated when it is a compound adjective and not hyphenated when it is not. (This is actually a pet-peeve of mine.)  Awadewit  |  talk  03:46, 14 January 2008 (UTC)           Oops! My bad. (Actually, I wrote that precisely to irk you! Yeah, that's it!) Â  Scartol Â Â  Tok  18:19, 15 January 2008 (UTC)             More to come! Â  Scartol Â Â  Tok  01:19, 14 January 2008 (UTC)   Illustrated Shakespeare edition and folio   I made a bunch of comments on this section last night, but somehow they got lost; since they're not in my contribs, I'm going to assume that I was a moron and forgot to save them or something. Argh! I'll try my best to recreate them.     The sentence  Unlike previous scholarly editions, the text was unencumbered by notes.  seems out of place. I'm not sure where to move it, but it sticks out in a paragraph which mostly describes the ornate decoration of the edition.           I'm not sure, either. It is a really important point, though.           I've tried to integrate this into an earlier sentence.  Awadewit  |  talk  04:38, 18 January 2008 (UTC)               The paragraph which starts  The volumes contain the 36 plays...  is filled with a technical breakdown of the data; could this be more of a prose paragraph and less a rundown of statistics? The same problem occurs at the end of the paragraph later which starts  The print folio, A Collection of Prints... .           The reason for this is the paucity of sources on Boydell's gallery. I felt that this information could be included, despite its technical status as original research because it is just counting. Anyone could verify this by themselves counting.  Awadewit  |  talk  08:34, 16 January 2008 (UTC)           I don't disagree that it's important information, but the style is pretty bleah. Maybe a little more commentary to go with the numbers? Â  Scartol Â Â  Tok  18:38, 16 January 2008 (UTC)           That's the whole issue - what commentary? The scholarship is so thin. My solution would be to take it out or cut it down - I'm not so sure how important it is.  Awadewit  |  talk  20:10, 16 January 2008 (UTC)                   Could we get a word on the mainstreamness of Northcote's criticism? Did other folks agree, or was he a lone voice? (I see this is revisited later in the article; maybe the quote should be moved?)           He was not a lone voice - I have moved his criticism to join the others. It is hard to say how representative this criticism was, but he was not the only one criticizing the project. I tried to indicate what the overall reaction was in the later section.  Awadewit  |  talk  08:34, 16 January 2008 (UTC)           He guessed that he could sell more folios and editions if the pictures were different. The edition's primary illustrators were known as book illustrators...  These sentences could use some kind of transition or link.           I rearranged the paragraph.           ...it was reissued throughout the 19th century.  Could we have a ""repeatedly"" or ""many times"" after ""reissued""? I think it would eradicate a slight vagueness.           Except I don't know how many times, so I don't know if it was ""repeatedly"".Â :)  Awadewit  |  talk  08:34, 16 January 2008 (UTC)           Alas! I'm hoping someday soon I'll find a text entitled  An Exploration of John Boydell's Folio Reprinting During the Nineteenth Century and Unrelated Commentary on Specific Revision and Publication Details about Balzac's Le Pre Goriot . But  Alibris  doesn't seem to have it. =) Â  Scartol Â Â  Tok  18:38, 16 January 2008 (UTC)             (I'm going to finish my first go-through before responding to replies. Hey! Where's my witty  2001  allusion? Just kidding.)   Gallery building     This contrast is echoed in Rev. George Reeves's description of Pall Mall in his  A New History of London... Isn't there some license afforded to drop the first article from a title if there's a possessive pronoun preceding it?           Done.  Awadewit  |  talk  08:40, 16 January 2008 (UTC)           this property had been the home of Goostree's gentleman's club from 1773 to 1787. Begun as a gambling club for wealthy young men, it had later become a reformist political club that counted William Pitt and William Wilberforce as members.  Three ""club""s in two sentences; could the two sentences be combined to remove one use of ""club""?           Nothing is coming to me here, but I'm still thinking.  Awadewit  |  talk  20:10, 16 January 2008 (UTC)           Changed second ""club"" to ""establishment"".  Awadewit  |  talk  04:38, 18 January 2008 (UTC)             Shakespeare Gallery in operation     It took over the public's imagination and became an end in and of itself.  The last phrase is unclear. I think I know what you mean, but I'd rather have something more explicit.           Combined with earlier sentence and deleted vague phrase.  Awadewit  |  talk  08:40, 16 January 2008 (UTC)           Furthermore, artists who had influence with the press...  ""Furthermore"" feels like the wrong word here. I think maybe it could even simply be dropped.           Deleted.  Awadewit  |  talk  08:40, 16 January 2008 (UTC)           The list of artists feels dry. Maybe include a word or two about which plays each one painted/engraved from?           Trust me, that feels even drier (see list below).  Awadewit  |  talk  08:40, 16 January 2008 (UTC)           These days  The Times  is usually followed by ""of London"" to differentiate it from  the other Times . Maybe we should do that here? Your call.           There was no  Times  of NYC, then, though. Do you still think we need to?  Awadewit  |  talk  08:40, 16 January 2008 (UTC)           I dunno. It's hard to say if I'm just being US-centric. Let's not! Those who assume it's the NYT can wallow in their own foolishness! Â  Scartol Â Â  Tok  18:38, 16 January 2008 (UTC)             Collapse  and  List of works     In a blockquote: ""there were few than could be approved""  is this accurate? Wouldn't it be ""that""?           Fixed.  Awadewit  |  talk  08:46, 16 January 2008 (UTC)           When both the Shakespeare enterprise and the Thames book failed, they had no capital to fall back upon.  This sounds like the ""they"" refers to the enterprise and book had no capital.           Replaced ""they"" with ""Boydells"".  Awadewit  |  talk  08:46, 16 January 2008 (UTC)           there were 64 winning tickets, each costing three guineas...  Didn't all the tickets cost the same? That phrase probably ought to be somewhere else.           Moved to after the total figure of tickets sold. Excellent point.  Awadewit  |  talk  08:46, 16 January 2008 (UTC)           I'm not clear on what the bylines in the List refer to (""by William Beechey""). Is there a way to clarify without ugly-ing up that very nicely-formatted list?           Those are the painters. I don't really know how to make that clear in the note at the top: ""These are the paintings and their painters"". Ew. We could always say the list does not include the names of the engravers, thereby implying it does include the names of the painters.  Awadewit  |  talk  08:46, 16 January 2008 (UTC)           I meant a much more general description, like changing the subhead to: ""List of art works"" or some such. I'm thinking of the teenager who sees the list and thinks: Merry Wives of Windsor, Act I, scene 1 by Robert Smirke? Didn't Shakespeare write that?"" Maybe I'm just being dense. Â  Scartol Â Â  Tok  18:38, 16 January 2008 (UTC)           Oh God. It never occurred to me that someone would think that. Changed to ""List of art works"".

If you would find such a review helpful, please click  here . Thanks,  APR Â  t  06:03, 14 January 2008 (UTC)     Review by Wrad     I think the first section after the lead would be easier to follow if it was split into three sub-sections: ""Rise of Nationalism"", ""Theatrical Revival"", and ""Shakespeare editions"", or such like.           Good suggestion - added.  Awadewit  |  talk  07:21, 15 January 2008 (UTC)           The first sentence of the third paragraph in the lead reads a bit funny, ""which..., but..., excited..."" It's all just too much to compute.           I think this detail isn't even necessary in the lead - removed.  Awadewit  |  talk  07:21, 15 January 2008 (UTC)           What are the ""36 plays attributed to Shakespeare"" which the edition contained? Which plays were left out?           Well, I assume it is the 36 plays of the First Folio, as listed in the  William Shakespeare  article.  Awadewit  |  talk  07:21, 15 January 2008 (UTC)           I think it would be nice to know if that's the case for sure.  Wrad  ( talk ) 18:40, 15 January 2008 (UTC)           My sources just say ""the 36 plays attributed to Shakespeare"", unfortunately. However, those are the standard 36.  Awadewit  |  talk  18:57, 15 January 2008 (UTC)                   Maybe say in the footnote where the  Hamlet  quote on the sculpture came from.           Added.  Awadewit  |  talk  07:21, 15 January 2008 (UTC)           Have any Shakespeare critics examined the paintings for insights into 18th-century views of Shakespeare's plays?           Yes, but as there were over 100 paintings by many different artists, it is impossible to say anything as a group about the paintings. That information would have to go on the individual pages about the paintings or the artists, I feel.  Awadewit  |  talk  07:21, 15 January 2008 (UTC)         I really like the pictures and the list at the end. Pretty darn good article overall.  Wrad  ( talk ) 18:04, 14 January 2008 (UTC)         Thanks. I wondered if the list was overkill. It would be nice to eventually link each entry with either an image an article. Ah, utopian ideals.  Awadewit  |  talk  07:21, 15 January 2008 (UTC)           [ edit ]   Joseph Priestley House   Awadewit  and I are the major contributors to this article about the American home of  Joseph Priestley  and would appreciate any comments, feedback, or suggestions on how to improve it. We will make brief articles to take care of the two red links, and are working on a map, but thought we could start the peer review process and work on those at the same time. We plan to submit this to  WP:FAC  in the future. Thanks in advance for your help,  Awadewit  and  Ruhrfisch   ><>    05:57, 10 January 2008 (UTC)   Comments from  User:Yllosubmarine  I'm not sure how much help I can be; I didn't even know there was a  Northumberland , PA! Still, here are a few thoughts:     I know nothing about city planning, so forgive me if this is common sense, but I find the phrase ""laid out around a central green"" goes completely over my head. What does this mean, exactly?    First off thanks for the very helpful comments. The Pennsylvania Northumberland is named for the British one, and was, as you say, a planned community (laid out by the planners, who then sold lots for building on to people who wanted to live there). Reflecting their British roots, they included a  village green  in the center of the new community. I have tweaked the sentence to read "" Northumberland was  laid out  around a central  village green  in 1772. "" Hopefully the wikilinks and added word make it clearer.  Ruhrfisch   ><>    15:26, 10 January 2008 (UTC)       Joseph and Mary lived with their son Joseph and his family in a small house while theirs was being built, and in 1798 Joseph Jr., his wife, and their children moved into the new house with Joseph.  This is rather jumbled up and confusing, what with the four ""Joseph""s. Perhaps split it into two sentences or separate it with a semi-colon?    My fault. We were not sure where to put this, and I think it would be better if it were moved to just after the quotation on Mary's death. The problem is that they had another son who did not live with them. I will let  Awadewit  try her hand at this. Perhaps something like the following (new version of moved sentence italicized):               ""This day I bury my wife....she had taken much thought in planning the new house and now that it is far advanced and promises to be everything she wished, she is removed to another.""[33]  Joseph Priestley Jr., had taken his parents into his family's small house while theirs was being built, and in 1798 Joseph Jr., his wife and children moved into the new house with his father.  Priestley's family relations...       Thanks,  Ruhrfisch   ><>    15:45, 10 January 2008 (UTC)           Another thought, it might work better to split it into two sentences and have just the first on where they lived while the house was being built where the problem sentence is now ( The senior Priestleys lived with their son Joseph and his family in a small house while theirs was being built. ). Then have the second on where they lived after the house was completed just after the quotation on Mary's death ( In 1798 Joseph Jr., his wife and children moved into the new house with his father. ). Does this seem any better?  Ruhrfisch   ><>    20:19, 10 January 2008 (UTC)       Moved to beginning of ""Architecture and landscaping"" with slight revision to make chronology clearer. See what you think.  Awadewit  |  talk  23:43, 10 January 2008 (UTC)               In his Memoirs Priestley wrote of his situation in Northumberland: ""the settlement was given up...""  This is the third quote that begins with a colon, but I don't think it works as well as the previous ones. It's also unnecessary to repeat ""Northumberland"" since it was stated in the previous two sentences. I would prefer to see it flow seamlessly, perhaps with an introduction similar to  Priestley wrote in his Memoirs that ""the settlement...     Changed it to your suggestion, thanks  Ruhrfisch   ><>    15:33, 10 January 2008 (UTC)           Aha! In regards to my second point above, I was wondering why the sentence had read that Jr. and his family moved into the new house with  Joseph , but there was no mention of Mary; four paragraphs later it's explained she died before it could be completed. This was confusing for me, so maybe if you rewrite that ""Joseph""-laden sentence, it will be less of a headache.    I think moving it here makes more sense - see above too, thanks  Ruhrfisch   ><>       Has this been solved?  Awadewit  |  talk  23:43, 10 January 2008 (UTC)               This is just a personal gripe, but I dislike double parentheses:  (referencing his own An History of the Corruptions of Christianity (177274))     Changed it to  its ""corruptions"", referencing his own   An History of the Corruptions of Christianity   (177274).  but if Awadewit prefers the original, please revert. Thanks,  Ruhrfisch   ><>    15:51, 10 January 2008 (UTC)    Fine with me.  Awadewit  |  talk  23:43, 10 January 2008 (UTC)             This is quite well written and highly comprehensive. I haven't read the Joseph Priestley article, but I was able to keep up with the subject matter fairly well. The history of the Priestley family in particular is very well told and I definitely got the sense of the importance of this house, not only in terms of Priestley's life, but also locally. The pictures are fantastic and it's a shame more pics from the commons cannot be added for fear of crowding out the text (I quite like the photos of the plaques, for example). I'm glad a map will be added; that would be very helpful for geography disinclined folks such as myself. I hope this has helped somewhat.Â :)  Mara   ( habla  con migo )  14:45, 10 January 2008 (UTC)         Hoefully the map will up within 12 - 14 hours. Thanks again for your most helpful review.  Ruhrfisch   ><>    15:51, 10 January 2008 (UTC)    The map is up on the  Talk:Joseph Priestley House  page for now - will be added to the article once it gets checked out and revised if need be.  Ruhrfisch   ><>    04:26, 11 January 2008 (UTC)           Comment  Recommend referencing:  The Priestleys fled Birmingham and attempted to live in London, but they could not escape the political turmoil.  and  Although Priestley was best-known in Europe as a scientist (he had discovered oxygen gas in 1774), Americans knew Priestley less as a man of science and more as a defender of the freedom of religion and as a supporter of American independence   LordHarris  20:07, 10 January 2008 (UTC)           Done.

Dincher  ( talk ) 21:27, 15 January 2008 (UTC)       [ edit ]   St Buryan   I've listed this article for peer review because     I have wanted for some time to bring this article up to featured article status. It was until recently listed as a good article but was downgraded by another editor requesting further referencing. I have addressed these concerns, and added extra material to the text. I realise that the article is probably not FA status yet, but would like some feedback on what else could be done to achieve this before nominating it for FA. At the very least I feel that it should be re-entered as a good article.   I feel that St Buryan would be a suitable FA candidate in terms of subject matter, not dissimilar to  Chew Valley  which is an existing geography FA about a similar sized location.

Thanks,  APR Â  t  01:12, 22 December 2007 (UTC)     I don't have a lot of time right now, so I'll just give you a couple of suggestions and come back later with some more.     I went ahead and fixed some small things myself, like expanding the PPV abbreviation to pay-per-view and some minor grammar problems.    Thanks!  Cheers,  Dav nel 03 Sign It,   Junior!  14:43, 26 December 2007 (UTC)       Make sure the citation numbers are in order in the article. Instead of being [25][12][24], they should be in numerical order. This is a problem throughout.    Done.  Cheers,  Dav nel 03 Sign It,   Junior!  14:43, 26 December 2007 (UTC)       Nobody is a bigger advocate of keeping the articles out of universe than me, but if you go too far with the wrestling jargon, you are isolating the non-wrestling readers and putting the article right back in-universe (just in the opposite manner). Sentences like "" The selling feud of the pay-per-view was between then-WWF Champion Diesel and Sycho Sid "" should read more like "" The most prominent feud leading up to the event was the feud between then-WWF Champion Diesel and his storyline rival Sycho Sid. "" Just look over the article, and if there is a sentence that you think may be confusing to a non-fan, the best bet is to reword it.    I'm guessing your just talking about mainly the first feud? You may of noticed that that sounds different to the remainder of the article. Those edits were done by me, but then the language was dramatically changed  here  by Screwball23 (who then created a rant at  WP:PW . Should I revert back to the first paragraph version before that?  Cheers,  Dav nel 03 Sign It,   Junior!  14:43, 26 December 2007 (UTC)       This is a small grammatical thing that nobody ever notices but me and a few other grammar nerds, but ""however"" should never be put at the beginning of a sentence in formal writing. "" However, in the interim, the creative team decided to diffuse direct confrontations between the two on-screen... "" should read "" In the interim, however, the creative team decided to diffuse direct confrontations between the two on-screen... "". In the end, it'll read better that way.    See above point (quotation again comes from first feud I believe).  Cheers,  Dav nel 03 Sign It,   Junior!  14:43, 26 December 2007 (UTC)         That's all for now. I'll be back probably tomorrow.  Nikki 311  05:13, 26 December 2007 (UTC)   After looking through the article history, I'd say you should probably revert the first paragraph to its previous version. While I believe Screwball was acting in good faith, he added a lot of POV and weaselly words that really shouldn't be there. Actually, I'll go ahead and do it since it really doesn't take much effort.  Nikki 311  00:17, 28 December 2007 (UTC)   I just went through and cleaned up the article. Here are a few things I wasn't sure about:     Sometimes you have move names in italics and sometimes they aren't. I'm not sure which it should be, but it should be uniform throughout. Specifically, the Razor's Edge is written with and without italics.   In the Hakushi vs. Hart match description, it says that after the match ""he"" jumped down and appeared to injure his knee. Is the ""he"" Bret Hart? I think it should be made clear who it was, and I wasn't 100% sure. That's why I didn't change it myself.  Nevermind. It is made clear later in the article, so I changed the wording myself.   Sometimes, it is better to combine short sentences to make more complex sentences. It reads as less choppy. I tried to fix this as I went through the article. I'd say a general rule would be to combine any short/simple sentences when there are three or more in a row.     That's all I've got. Hopefully, somebody (with fresh eyes) comes along and makes some suggestions.  Nikki 311  01:07, 28 December 2007 (UTC)     [ edit ]   Blood+   I've listed this article for peer review because significant work has been done in the article over the last view weeks and I think it has been significantly improved (see  [4]  for what it was like before).

I'm aware of some defects in the article (some writing structure, formatting of the sources is only about 50% complete), but wanted to get the process started to expedite the improvement of the article.

Someone does need to go through all of the references and make sure they all have the necessary information because some them are just links to an article. It also might help if there was some more organization in the external links section. Finally, someone should make sure that all books referenced in the article have the applicable ISBN numbers listed. But that is pretty much all I saw in one read. I made a couple of small changes but other than the suggestions above it looks good to me (but I am new at reviewing articles so maybe I am missing something).

It just barely missed being a Good Article because of one few unreferenced section, which has now been fixed.

Thanks,   Farix  ( Talk ) 16:50, 21 December 2007 (UTC)         Reply  You may be right, but without more details about what references might be excess, unnecessary, or redundant, there weren't any guidelines for removing citations.

Thanks,  APR Â  t  01:12, 22 December 2007 (UTC)       A stub or something for  Kyoto International Manga Museum  would be nice.           Reply  It already exists.  Timothy Perper  ( talk ) 16:54, 7 January 2008 (UTC)       Why no pre-WWII pictures? In fact, this goes for the entire article. The subject is intensely subjective and visual - it's about art! - and so too many pictures is not enough. A picture of a manga cafe would be good too, or perhaps a picture on a train where everyone is reading manga. It's one thing to say it's a major part of modern life, and another to actually show it.    Reply  Not enough room to put in all the pictures we need. There have been discussions about this for months, but no simple solution has emerged.  Timothy Perper  ( talk ) 16:54, 7 January 2008 (UTC)       Also, it seems to have an odd focus. In the post-WWII section, we have 2 sections on Shojo (which is all well and good since Shojo is a very important category of manga) and then we jump straight to '3 Manga publications'. ...what? There are other important genres to be covered, from shonen to American-style murder mysteries and suspense to the early sci-fi and mecha stuff, too.    Reply  This has been fixed by inserting completely new, heavily referenced sections on manga for male readers and on gekiga manga.  Timothy Perper  ( talk ) 16:54, 7 January 2008 (UTC)    Reply  Added later. The new sections are  major  additions to the article, not merely a sentence or two.  Timothy Perper  ( talk ) 20:39, 7 January 2008 (UTC)           In general, I'd like to see more pictures/screenshots, particularly if they are spaced out in time such that you can see the evolution from the most primitive '40s era manga art-style to the slickest modern one, or if they illustrate the various 'styles' of manga (like 4-koma or full page spreads like  Blade of the Immortal  uses, etc.);    Reply  Not enough room for the pictures. I wish there were room.  Timothy Perper  ( talk ) 16:54, 7 January 2008 (UTC)       a section on the intertwined relationship of anime and manga; and a finer-grained breakdown of sections - they are pretty monolithic.    Reply  Again, not enough room to go into anime-manga connections.         -- Gwern   (contribs)  02:11  22 December   2007  (GMT)     Under the djinshi section, I find the part about omakes to be out of place especially because it's mentioned before defining djinshi. Omakes is not only a part of djinshi. Maybe move the omake part under publications?  Toothpyx  ( talk ) 17:51, 22 December 2007 (UTC)           Reply  I agree that the dojinshi section -- the whole publication section, in fact -- needs a lot of work. But it's not my area of expertise, and I can't do it. Someone else will have to fill in here.  Timothy Perper  ( talk ) 16:54, 7 January 2008 (UTC)           A few things about the article, in no particular order.       First, there's some excess detail. In statements like ""Another example is CLAMP's Magic Knight Rayearth, whose three young heroines, Hikaru, Umi, and Fuu, are magically transported to the world of Cephiro to become armed magical warriors in the service of saving Cephiro from internal and external enemies."" the names of the planet and the heroines should be removed to focus the reader's attention on what matters. Perhaps the example should be removed entirely. I suggest searching for other places where the article gives too much detail.    Reply  It seemed unwise to remove  Magic Knight Rayearth , since it is one of the most popular manga in both Japan and the US. Removing the heroines' names deletes only a few words. But without more details about other examples you consider excess, unnecessary, or redundant, there wasn't much else I could do about this issue.  Timothy Perper  ( talk ) 16:54, 7 January 2008 (UTC)       Second, there's a fruit salad of orthographic styles. The same name is written variously, for example with or without macrons, or with long vowels written as  ou . Japanese words suffer the same fate (shojo and shjo, for example). Is ""Aikawa Minwa"" correct? There's a spelling error in the transliteration of Versailles.    Reply  Yes, Aikawa Minwa is correct. Versailles has been fixed. Sometimes the macrons are missing in the original titles and references, and we can't add them without getting those titles and references wrong. Perhaps you yourself could correct other mistakes when you find them?  Timothy Perper  ( talk ) 16:54, 7 January 2008 (UTC)       The article should be proofread with the goal of bringing it into accord with  Wikipedia:Manual of Style . The abbreviation ""lit."" is unnecessary even if the explanations are kept (see ""Do not use unwarranted abbreviations"" in Wikipedia:Manual of Style). There are a few slashes. See ""Avoid joining two words by a slash"" in the Manual of Style. There are variations on styles (quotes, italics, no styling) the article uses for titles, foreign words, and words as words. There are several mixed citation styles (with inline citation and a footnote number), for example, ""(Schodt 1986, p. 88) 6  "" . Are these dual-format citations required, or should they be simplified? ""Bande Dessine"" has capital letters in one place where it should have lowercase. There are various abbreviations of ""United States"" (I noticed ""U.S.A."" and ""US."") Spaces around a dash in the sentence ""All of these innovations  strong and independent female characters, intense emotionality, and complex design  remain characteristic of shjo manga up to the present day."" result in a line beginning with a dash (when I view it on my screen). The Manual of Style specifies no spaces around dashes.    Reply  Fixed these.       I don't think it's fruitful to explain ""image-centered"" as ""pictocentric"" and ""word-centered"" as ""logocentric"" in this article. Can we remove the explanations, which don't appear elsewhere in the article, and don't clarify (at least to me) the simpler terms?    Reply  Those two words aren't explanations, they're the words used by the author being quoted. I think this is a matter of taste, actually, and I left them.  Timothy Perper  ( talk ) 16:54, 7 January 2008 (UTC)       Some sentences need editing. ""In 1969, a group of women mangaka later called ""The Magnificent 24s"" made their shjo manga debut (the term comes from the Japanese name for 1949, when many of these artists were born)."" (Which term?)  Reply: fixed this.  ""Although sometimes manga are drawn centering on previously existing live-action or animated films.[17][18] (e.g. Star Wars)."" I'm not sure of the point of the sentence ""Although U.S. Occupation censorship policies specifically targeted art and writing that glorified war and Japanese militarism,[6] those policies did not prevent the publication of other kinds of material, including manga."" Is it saying that policies permitted manga, or that policies permitted glorification of war and Japanese militarism in manga (but not in other forms of expression)?    Reply  I changed ""targeted"" into ""prohibited.""  Timothy Perper  ( talk ) 16:54, 7 January 2008 (UTC)       English could substitute for a lot of foreign terms. Do extended glosses like ""redisu / josei  "" really add to the word ""ladies'"" or should they be removed? Do we need a repeat (""This ""Ladies Comic"" subgenre (in Japanese, redisu , redikomi , and josei) has dealt with themes of young adulthood"")?  Reply: fixed this.  How many times is the German word  bildungsroman  necessary, and can the English term ""coming-of-age,"" which it explains, substitute for it? In the English Wikipedia, most of these foreign-language terms should be removed, especially in articles to which  Manga  links, when the terms are explained in the article.    Reply:   Bildungsroman  is the correct technical term, and the one used by Wikipedia itself for the article. It is defined in an endnote.  Timothy Perper  ( talk ) 16:54, 7 January 2008 (UTC)       Are all the people called ""scholars"" scholars? One is  Takashi Murakami . He well might be; I don't know. Having skimmed the article on him, I don't get the impression of a scholar, but perhaps I missed something, or the article on him omitted his scholarship. (It covers artistic and entrepreneurial activities and mentions that he left a doctoral program.) The same word also describes  Frederik L. Schodt . However, the article on him says that he is a writer, translator and interpreter famous for translating manga. Again, he might be a scholar, but writer, translator and interpreter don't add up to scholar. A scholar could write a book with a title like ""Manga! Manga! The World of Japanese Comics"" but writing a book with that title doesn't automatically make him a scholar. Critical examination of the roles of these authors can help bring this article to the next level.    Reply  I changed the word ""scholar"" to ""author"" and ""writer"" since it serves no purpose to debate Schodt's scholarship. Yes, he is a scholar, and one of the best in this field, but that's not the point here.  Timothy Perper  ( talk ) 16:54, 7 January 2008 (UTC)       Separate from the word used for Murakami and Schodt, the quality of the references should be examined. For Good and Featured articles, Wikipedia wants sources that are progressively more reliable. When sources are marginal, ask whether the statements they support are important to the exposition. If they are, find better sources; if they're not, remove or reword the statements to avoid the need for those marginal sources. Aim for works that provide scholarship, rather than armchair sociology.    Reply  The citations used are all of high reliability. Without a list of references you believe to be ""armchair sociology,"" there isn't anything I can do about this issue. At another time, we can discuss my own credentials for making the choices I did, but not here.  Timothy Perper  ( talk ) 16:54, 7 January 2008 (UTC)         Also, notes about the Constitution of Japan related to censorship reference Kodansha; it seems more useful to reference the Constitution itself (see the article on it for a link to Wikisource in English).         Reply  This puzzled me at first, since the Kodansha encyclopedia citation we used takes one  precisely  to the Japanese Constitution itself, but then I realized that you probably don't know the encyclopedia. I added some page references and clarified the issue, I hope.  Timothy Perper  ( talk ) 16:54, 7 January 2008 (UTC)       The ""Publications"" section, prior to ""Magazines,"" has no citations. Many of the statements could reasonably be challenged. The section is close to the border of what Wikipedia calls ""original research.""    Reply  I agree. I did no work on this section, except for the Gegika section (which was completely rewritten and referenced). Several times on the discussion page, I've recommended that it be removed (except Gekiga) or moved to another article, but there has been no consensus on the issue. Future editors will have to take up this problem, since I will be making no further major additions or changes to the manga article.

Although it's not necessary to fix every indirect link in Wikipedia, I'd hope that editors aiming to bring an article to Good or Featured standing would make them all direct.    Reply . Fixed these. Timothy Perper  ( talk ) 16:54, 7 January 2008 (UTC)       Most of these are minor points. A thorough proofreading is time-consuming and tedious, but it can address many of the issues I've raised. This article is interesting, informative, and accessible. I'd like to see you pick the nits and get it the recognition it deserves.  Fg2  ( talk ) 07:26, 23 December 2007 (UTC)           Thank you  for your suggestions, everyone. They have been very helpful, and I regret that I wasn't able to use all of them. Future editors will doubtless find them very useful.   I will now no longer be making any further major additions or changes to this article. Back in September 2007, when Peregrine Fisher and I started to work on it, we had a list of topics and headings we wanted to upgrade. That list is now complete, and I believe we were successful in significantly improving the article by adding quality writing and references (we added over 200 solid, reliable references). But that job is done now, so it is now up to other people to continue to work on this entry.               The only  advice I'd pass on is that dealing with the bibliography may be tricky if you start deleting references wholesale or without asking if they are mentioned in other references (e.g., in what is known as an ""op. cit."" =  opus citandum  reference).               As some  of you have guessed, I am what Wikipedians sometimes call an ""expert."" It is not alway a term of praise on Wikipedia, where -- I'm saddened by this, actually -- experts are treated sometimes scornfully, sometimes with hostility, and sometimes with outright dislike. Some editors are exceptionally welcoming, but not all by any means. So this has been a mixed experience for me, sometimes good, but often not pleasant at all. I frankly doubt if I will do any more detailed editing on Wikipedia again. Too much hostile, pointless bickering, too much petty backbiting, and too many naive wannabes trying to call the shots about things they don't know. But I will say it has been  interesting.               Good luck  with this article.

Needs overall comments towards FA criteria. -  Mocko13  18:13, 27 February 2007 (UTC)     I did not forget you Mocko13!

Thanks,  APR Â  t  00:13, 1 March 2007 (UTC)       [ edit ]   Review by Awadewit   This is a very good article; it was a pleasure to read. Here are my suggestions as you work towards FA.     There are quite a few sentences that de-emphasize their subject matter through awkward phrasing, wordiness or clause placement. Here are some examples:       His contributions to the art of drama include expanding the number of characters in plays from one to two, which allowed conflict and interaction between characters rather than limiting plays to dialogue between one character and the chorus.  - Could you foreground his contribution in the sentence? For example, ""He expanded the number of characters to allow for conflict between them; previously, characters interacted only with the chorus."" (something like that)   Aeschylus' life and career took place in the context of the Persian invasion of Greece, which influenced the subject matter of many of his works.  - ""in the context of"" sounds awkward to me. Which part of the sentence is most important? I have a feeling you want to emphasize that his works are about the Persian invasion, but this is only a secondary emphasis; try reworking for emphasis.   There followed a second competition of five comedic playwrights like Aristophanes, and the winners of both competitions were chosen by a panel of judges.  - awkward - what do you want to emphasize?   The theme of the gods interfering in human affairs, and placing them in difficult situations, continues in Seven Against Thebes (Hepta epi Thebas), which was performed in 467 BC.  - awkward opening phrase, particularly because the previous paragraph emphasizes that  The Persians  is about human events   Its tragic story of a war between Thebes and Argos also marks the first known appearance in Aeschylus' work of a theme which would continue through his plays, that of the polis (the city or citizenship) as the highest development of human civilization.  - awkward and wordy - what do you want to emphasize?       one of these plays, Prometheus Bound, is sometimes thought not to be the work of Aeschylus  - While attribution issues are important, I do not think this one belongs in the lead.   The young Aeschylus began writing a tragedy as soon as he woke, and his first performance took place in 499 BC, when he was only 26 years old.  - ""as soon as he woke"" is awkward   After fifteen years, his skill was great enough to win a prize for his plays at Athens' annual City Dionysia, a festival dedicated to Dionysus.  - awkward   There is a sudden switch from playwriting to fighting in the middle of the ""Life"" section. Could you transition between the two, perhaps by giving us a bit of historical background? Did Aeschylus have to give up playwrighting to defend his country or something like that?   This pivotal defeat of the Persian King Darius' invading horde by the outnumbered soldiers of the Greek Delian League ended the first Persian invasion of Greece proper and was celebrated across the city-states of Greece.  - what is an ""invading horde"" exactly? Perhaps that phrase should go.   However, the glory was tempered for Aeschylus personally when his brother was killed in the battle.  - awkward - how about ""However, the victory was bittersweet for Aeschylus because his brother was killed in the battle"" (or something like that).   The crushing Athenian victory over the Persian fleet at Salamis was to become the subject of The Persians, his oldest surviving play, which was performed in 472 BC and won first prize.  - won first prize at the Dionysia?   Aeschylus traveled to Sicily once or twice in the 470s BC, having been invited by Hieron of Syracuse, a major Greek city on the eastern side of the island.  - it almost sounds like Hieron is a major Greek city   Sometimes you write  Eumenides  and sometimes  The Eumenides .   I think you could say a little more about the themes of  Agammemnon . At least a sentence or two. In fact, I think that the plays get short shrift in general. Maybe a little subsection on each play (there are only seven) with quotations? In particular, could you say more about  Prometheus Unbound ?   Pick an italicization scheme - are tetralogies italicized or not? You are inconsistent. Also, all play titles should be italicized.   Aeschylus added a second actor, such that the actors themselves could have conflicts and engage in dialogue, while the chorus took less immediate a role.  - awkward   Your notes are not all formatted the same way. Also, I do not think it is necessary to write ""page"". It is more customary to simply include the author's name and the page number.   In your references, please include commas after the editors' names and before ""ed"" and since you have decided to include the place of publication, you should probably include it for all of the references for the sake of consistency.   I would think about removing these ""External Links"": IMDB list of films based on Aeschylus (you don't talk about pop cultural representations anywhere else); Schlegel, August Wilhelm, Lectures on Dramatic Art and Literature, 1809 (just link from note), Selected Monologues by Aeschylus on Monologue Search (particularly this one, since you have to join to view)  Awadewit  02:09, 1 March 2007 (UTC)       [ edit ]   Yannismarou   Nicely done. These are my suggestions for FAC:     ""As soon as he woke from the dream, the young Aeschylus began writing a tragedy, and his first performance took place in 499 BC, when he was only 26 years old.[4][3]"" I think it is nicer if the notes are in the right order ([3][4]). Now, you can also avoid having citations in a row by combining them. See various ways of combining citations in  Tourette syndrome ,  Battle of Edson's Ridge  etc.   ""The trilogy consists of Agamemnon, The Liberation Bearers (Choephoroi), and The Eumenides."" Be careful with the wikilinks. In this sentence, for instance, instead of linking to the article (the section of another article to be accurate) about the play ""Agamemnon"", you linked to the mythological king. I fixed these links, but, in general, be careful with all these often confusing wikilinks.   I would like a more detailed analysis of his artistic traits and his literary importance. Why is he regerded as the greater ancient playright? What are the characteristics that make his art sublime? How did he influence Roman theatre, and did he even influence Shakespeare and other dramatists of this era? Has his work influenced the Western culture and theatre from Renaissance and afterwards? I think that questions like these ones could find some answers in the article.   You cite no primary sources. This may be a personal preference, but I think that secondary sources should supplement and co-exist with primary ones. But in  Hippocrates , I had a similar argument presented, and the editor explained to me with solid arguments his choice to focus on just secondary sources. But, at least, we should know how do we know all this stuff about his life: who wrote down, and who transmitted this biographical information to the next generations, and to modern historical times? How do we know that he lived and did all these things while living?   Another question you would like maybe to answer in the article: who saved his works? Thanks to whom we have the chance to read his plays, and to know that Aeschylus is the person who wrote them? How did these masterpieces pass from one generation to the next one?-- Yannismarou  18:25, 4 March 2007 (UTC)       To back up what Yannismarou has said, the article needs a critical analysis of Aechylus' work as a whole. Indeed the section on Influence over Greek culture should be expanded to cover his influence on drama and the theatre as a whole. Certainly a section on Aeschylus' reputation through the ages would be most helpful (something like  Shakespeare's reputation ). Otherwise, this is a marvelous start to a very important article! I'm a theatre person and I would be most willing to help if you need it. I do have access to a fairly good academic library so I have access to some sources you may not have.

Thank you very much.  Bestlyriccollection  ( talk )     Hi. It's a good piece of work that has one enormous flaw - it is almost entirely unreferenced. Try going through the article and every time the article claims something (""Many groups speaking ""Turkic"" languages never adopted the name ""Turk"" as self identity."" or ""There is no doubt regarding the etymology of the name ""Fu Lin""..."" for example) ask yourself ""Says who?"" If you like, I can do it for you by adding a bunch of {{cn}} tags.

Maybe it is Hugh Pope. 4) Peter Mansfield, ""the Arabs"", talking about the formation of the ""Arab Nationality"" during late Ottoman period. Of course, one must look into books that deal heavily with the subjects of Namik Kemal, Ziya Gokalp, Ataturk's Republican Reforms, Young Turks, Tekin Alp, Nihal Atsiz etc.    That's great, but doesn't address my concerns at all. You urgently need to read  this section  of arguably our most important policy.

Here are some things that I would work on:     Avoid cumbersome phrases and constructions to enhance readability. I lightly edited the lead to illustrate this point. You might consider referring this article to an experienced copy editor; a second pair of eyes is often helpful.       This article includes plenty of useful information, but there is a clear need for more citations. This is especially true in cases where the article describes the supposed motivations of Zhuge Liang's detractors. These kinds of observations, in the absence of citations, may strike readers as speculation on the part of contributors. Speculation qualifies as original research (OR).       Be aware of style issues. I inserted endashes where they seemed appropriate. It is also my understanding that users should avoid highlighting partial dates, e.g., 916. I delinked these dates, but I recommend that you consult the Manual of Style for additional information.     Again, this article is filled with interesting information. If you want to bring it up to GA standards, you might start by streamlining the prose and including more citations. I hope this helps!

Thanks,   Wikipediatoperfection  ( talk ) 21:12, 19 December 2007 (UTC)     [ edit ]   Review by  Twelsht   I didn't have time to read this article thoroughly. But after skimming it, a couple of things caught my eye. Watch out for MOS issues. Your standard (American) use of quotation marks doesn't conform to Wikipedia style. This is one of the first things that will catch the eye of a reviewer on the GAC. It's also a good idea to avoid overlinking, a temptation to which I've often succumbed. If I remember correctly, most of your links were perfectly appropriate. But you probably don't need to link terms such as ""district attorney,"" which are familiar to most native speakers of English. At a glance, the piece looks fairly comprehensive. I'll take a closer look tomorrow. Best, --  twelsht  ( talk ) 05:48, 20 December 2007 (UTC)     After a closer reading, the article still looks reasonably comprehensive. On the whole, it's well written and well organized. A couple issues concerned me, however. I was confused by the extended reference to Bestor Robinson. The article noted that Robinson was a conservationist and an avid rock climber, but there was no effort to link this information to Warren. Did Robinson influence Warren's views on conservationism? If so, this needs to be stated. A second concern is the absence of inline citations, an omission that won't be difficult to rectify. There should be plenty of available online sources dealing with this prominent figure. Again, the article is fairly comprehensive. It would be stronger if the material were supported with references, preferably inline citations. I made a couple of minor style edits, all of which include edit summaries. (Be aware of Wikipedia's guidelines for punctuation.) I've also found that it's best to avoid highlighting partial dates, e.g., 1946. That said, I've come across exceptions to this rule in some sports articles, e.g.,  1915 . Where I encountered similar links in this article, I left them alone. Overall, this piece shouldn't be difficult to upgrade to GA standards. The most pressing issue, in my view, is a need for inline citations. I hope this helps! Thanks, again, for your feedback! --  twelsht  ( talk ) 19:08, 20 December 2007 (UTC)     One last thing:  You could note that many historians connect Warren's regrets over his support for Japanese-American internment to his later commitment to civil rights.

This article clearly needs one, and some topics it might address include: why was the group formed? for what purpose? did it fulfill its original purpose or has that been redefined over time? how? something many SAR units have trouble with is inclusion of women: did the original bylaws specifically exclude or specifically include women? how about black men? how about ""Oriental"" men? Say something about the connection with Boy Scouts; does it still exist today? how does it work? do teenagers get out of school for SAR missions? Can they respond at night? How do you handle the logistics of having many SAR team members too young to drive a vehicle on a public road? does the group in fact have a lot of young team members? Does their youth nececessitate special procedures for missions that may involve a suicide or other highly sensitive, damaging mission scenario?   I think Tiptoety wants to write an article about this group but has not yet ""discovered"" what to write. Currently it is rather a list of factoids and boilerplate info gathered from the unit's website. Is this article intended as a recruiting tool for the group? If so, it does not belong on Wikipedia.   The article needs references. Only one of the items now treated as references seems to be a true reference. Most of the others are external links to the group's website or to other groups' websites. Appropriate references would include historical newspaper articles about the group's adventures in SAR or local politics or whatever it does that is  notable . Or, if you can get the group to deposit its old bylaws somewhere public, you could then cite them.   The one real reference appears after something about hundreds of homicides being solved by the group; IMO finding evidence during a search of a crime scene does not equal solving the case.     -- Una Smith  ( talk ) 04:37, 21 December 2007 (UTC)     [ edit ]   Neilston   I've listed this article (about a village in  Scotland ) for peer review because I have some experience in obtaining GA and FA for articles about British settlements, though find  WP:PR  invaluable in furthering these articles.

Provide more context in the intro paragraph, like ""...a village of 5,000 people..."" - a village for me is less than 1,000 people. What kind of agriculture are they involved with? Avoid single-sentence paragraph - sounds like the ""Toponymy"" sub-section would make a better paragraph than section. The ""History"" section is weak and generalized. I'm sure its history is not earth-shattering but the story of its development would better illustrate what the village is. The best History sections I've read are written as narratives (the story of the village). Clarify the local government part: is it governed by its own mayor and council? or by a regional authority? Or to put it differently, who do the people elect? A map of the town (with roads, rail, parks, water courses, etc) is invaluable - I had success approaching government offices for them (eg.  Image:PouceCoupe BC map.PNG ). Can we get a demography tables that compare the settlement to the regional area and/or country. Any historical population data available?

If you would find such a review helpful, please click  here . Thanks,  APR Â  t  01:22, 19 December 2007 (UTC)     Some points (mainly from the start of the article):     The infobox picture manages to have most of the town in shade with the sky being the really striking thing. Would it be possible to lighten the bottom of the picture a bit so it was easier to pick out detail?     Y   Done     The infobox has a website option, you could put the Neilston.org website in here.     N   Not done  - per the infobox rollout, this is reserved for official governmental sites only I'm afraid.     I don't think it should be ""Neilston"" in the History section. Possibly  Neilston  though.     Y   Done     'Over his grave a burial mound, according to the custom of the age, was erected, and called Neilston, from which, according to this theory, the locality ultimately received its name' - this is very clunky! How about 'According to the custom of the age a burial mound named Neilston was erected over his grave and the locality ultimately received the same name'.     Y   Done     You put a citation to each theory apart from the one about the 'supposed Highland chief, name Neil' (which should be 'named' anyway) which together with the 'supposed' and 'allegedly' makes it look very weak. Is it?     N   Not done  - hard to say. I've quoted the source almost word for word. Certainly the next couple of sentences discredit this theory.     I don't think that you need to link the 2nd  Neil . Check for more of these ('football' for example).     Y   Done     'Neilston's earliest history is unknown' - is this needed given we've just been told about pre-recorded history in the previous section     Y   Done     Is there any info about what was farmed or done in the village pre-industrial revolution, particularly if unusual     N   Not done  - I've purchased a new book which should help; I'll take a look asap.     though evidence attests that the settlement is much older than its larger neighbour Barrhead' - it would be nice to know what this evidence is or have some vague explanation. Maybe mention the age of Barrhead.     N   Not done  - I'd be interested to know too. Struggling for source material, but will see what I can find now the challenge has been set.   Y   Done     'The first known recorded mention' - this is clunky too, is there any reason to expect unknown recorded mentions or could 'known' be cut?     Y   Done     Link  dun . Maybe doun should be in italics but I'm not sure.     Y   Done     'prefix perhaps implying' - is this your speculation or the sources? Why not just a physically cold dun?   'Neilston was the most important settlement in its region' - how large a region are we talking about here?     Y   Done     'Despite this distinction of central importance' - apart from this being a fairly meaningless set of words I'm not sure that you've established any central importance. It had a chapel, it may have had a fort or watchtower. How many people lived there? How did this compare to other places in the area at the time?   I would link calico     Y   Done     'one whole connected village' - does it really need both of these?     Y   Done     just scanning quickly through the rest there's a bit of stray capitalisation on links, you might as well link things like 'Primary school' as school systems may be a bit different in the part of the world that the reader is from.   Can we have a scan of the 1895 map of Neilston? Are there any older maps?     N   Not done  - the 1895 map which I have to hand is  A2 , and I have an  A4  scanner. I have approached a local history group for historic photographs, illustrations or maps that could be added though.     That's all I've got time for for now. I'll come back to it later.

'Lying within the county boundaries of Renfrewshire from a very early time, from 1845 until 1975, Neilston formed its own parish.' - I would rewrite this as it can be read that 1845 to 1975 was the very early time which I assume is not the case. Plus how is the 2nd half of the sentence related to the 1st? Split into 2 sentences maybe?   Is the coor template needed at the start of the article and the Geography section?     N   Not done  This seems to be the standard of all  place  articles within the remit of  WP:CITIES  and  WP:UKGEO . Certainly all UK FAs have them both.     link  Loam ,  Turnpike     Y   Done     'Amongst the hilly areas of the village, the soil is of less fertility, whilst in all other parts, the land is moorland and mossy' - 'is less fertile'? also the  land  is moor land  doesn't sound good and this sentence started talking about soil and finishes talking about land, has a bit been missed out maybe?     Y   Done     'rising to a height of from' - this doesn't work, rising to the highest height maybe or reword if you want to give the range.     Y   Done     'Long loch' - capitalise     Y   Done     ""Aboon the Brae"" - this needs explaining     Y   Done  (not sure I've explained this to what you had in mind)     I'm not sure that it is worth mentioning the population density figure unless you say whether this is high / low etc.   'There was no Roman Catholic church or chapel in Neilston between 1560 and 1861; there was no Roman Catholic community' - was there one prior to 1560? if so what happened to those Roman Catholics? Also presumably there was some community pre-1861, surely the church wasn't erected at exactly the instant the 1st Catholic arrived?     Y   Done  - I think I've cleared this up, but this may need checking.     'stretching back more than 170 years' - can we just say what date it started then it will never need updating!     Y   Done     Why 'Midge Hole'?     Y   Done     The M77 gets 2 mentions. 1 is probably enough.     Y   Done     Can you get a ref for the 2nd OBrien sentence?

I would think this is a basic question that this introductory article should explain clearly. But the lead section does not answer it, and the only explanation in the article is this: ""Replication of virus particles is the stage where a cell uses foreign messenger RNA in its protein synthesis systems to produce viral proteins. The RNA or DNA synthesis abilities of the cell produce the virus' nucleic acids by viral polymerase."" No links. This does not help an introductory reader understand.   Quadell   ( talk ) ( random )  16:51, 14 December 2007 (UTC)       [ edit ]   Una Smith     The lead mentions in passing the big question ""Are viruses alive"" but this topic does not appear in the article. Some other big questions: Where did the first virus come from? How did it evolve? What did it evolve from? Do all viruses share a single common ancestor virus? Are all viruses bad?   A section on the history of virology would be appropriate.   A section on the use of viruses as tools in biomedical engineering would be appropriate.   Explain how viruses usually get from one animal host to another, then also explain how they get from one plant host to another. Plants don't walk around touching stuff, shake hands, copulate, sneeze, or vomit, so how  do  their viruses spread?     -- Una Smith  ( talk ) 04:48, 21 December 2007 (UTC)     [ edit ]   Rufus Wilmot Griswold   Relatively obscure writers and critics from the 19th century deserve attention too!

( Wikipedia:Manual of Style (capital letters) )   Abbreviate United States to ""U.S."" or ""U.S.A."" to make it fit on one line in the infobox.   Avoid the use of terms such as ""famous for"" and ""best known for"", just mentioning the important stuff is sufficient.   The lead should give a summary of the article, I think details such as ""Born in Vermont, Griswold left his family at age 15."" and ""It was in Philadelphia that Griswold first met Edgar Allan Poe."" should be removed. Instead, maybe try to summarize each of the article's sections in one or two lines. ( Wikipedia:Lead section )           I did my best to follow the spirit of  WP:LEAD , but I'm having trouble understanding how I can summarize the article without including things like ""Born in Vermont..."" and ""first met Edgar Allan Poe"". -- Midnightdreary  ( talk ) 14:39, 27 December 2007 (UTC)           Wikilink words that provide context such as ""farmer"", ""shoemaker"", and ""Philadelphia"".

Any ideas? -- Midnightdreary  ( talk ) 20:37, 27 December 2007 (UTC)    Regarding ""Memoir"" - it was basically an essay that used the title ""Memoir"" (alternatively ""Memoir of the Author""). Definitely not presented as an autobiography. I tried to clarify that section a bit, and was a little more careful of using the ""forged"" term. I think it makes more sense this way. -- Midnightdreary  ( talk ) 23:23, 28 December 2007 (UTC)                           [ edit ]   Nottingham Panthers   Archived review: Wikipedia:Peer review/Nottingham Panthers/archive1   This is already a GA and I'd now like to get it up to FA standard.

Being picky as FA is the target:   Things which require citation:    First competitive game   secured their second English League title by one point over Streatham.   membership fell to five   the Ice Stadium decided to shut down the Nottingham Panthers.   modern Panthers took to the ice for the first time defeating the Solihull Barons 74 at the Ice Stadium.   The Panthers lost all four of their quarter final group games and failed to advance to the finals at Wembley Arena.   Some of these may be covered by a reference elsewhere in the same paragraph. In such cases there is no need to repeat the citation.       ""Summer"" means a different time of year to those in the southern hemisphere. If the exact month is not known, try ""close-season"" or similar.   Ensure that there is consistency in use of plurals. Most of the time the article uses plural form, but occasionally there are phrases like  Nottingham was defeated 32 in the first leg .   Perhaps a short section about the rivalry with the Steelers could be included, as it is the biggest rivalry in British hockey.     Hope this helps.

I could see  Robert Bolt  adapting the article into a play, similar to his  A Man for All Seasons  just because of the tragic ending of its publisher. It's also amazing you could find out this much about a periodical from several centuries ago. This is definitely FA material. I have a few comments below which may or may not be useful.- BillDeanCarter  ( talk ) 09:36, 14 December 2007 (UTC)     The lede could be improved to briefly summarize the sections about the political leanings and the  Anti-Jacobin Review .           This will take some time. I find leads very difficult to write!  Awadewit  |  talk  19:29, 14 December 2007 (UTC)           First attempt has been made.  Awadewit  |  talk  02:31, 16 December 2007 (UTC)               Joseph Johnson, co-founder of the Analytical Review, by William Sharp (after Moses Haughton)  Perhaps the caption should explain what kind of portrait of Johnson this is, considering Sharp was a line-engraver. Out of interest, what is meant by (after Moses Haughton)?           Now reads:  Engraving by William Sharp after a painting by Moses Haughton of Joseph Johnson, co-founder of the Analytical Review  - it is hard to work all of those prepositional phrases in - do you have a better formulation?  Awadewit  |  talk  19:29, 14 December 2007 (UTC)           No, that's perfect.- BillDeanCarter  ( talk ) 15:18, 15 December 2007 (UTC)               The first was Dissenting theologian, clergyman, and scientist Joseph Priestley's Theological Repository (177073; 178488).  Maybe rephrase this as ""The first was the Theological Repository, created by the __ Joseph Priestley, for the purposes of...""           WillowW  has already spotted this problem, I think:  The first was the Theological Repository (published 177073; 178488), whose driving force was Dissenting theologian, clergyman, and scientist Joseph Priestley.   Awadewit  |  talk  19:29, 14 December 2007 (UTC)           That works nicely.- BillDeanCarter  ( talk ) 15:18, 15 December 2007 (UTC)               This periodical ceased just before the death of its proprietor.  Is ceased a common truncation for ceased publication?           This periodical ceased publication just before the death of its proprietor.  - Added ""publication"" for clarity.  Awadewit  |  talk  19:29, 14 December 2007 (UTC)           Both Henry Fuseli and Mary Wollstonecraft reviewed their own books for the journal, for example.  Did this go unnoticed at the time or did it cause some criticism of the  Analytical Review ? I know the  Anti-Jacobin Review  criticized them on other matters from your article.           It was unnoticed because the public didn't know who the reviewers were since they signed their reviews with letters and not names.  Awadewit  |  talk  19:29, 14 December 2007 (UTC)           Yet, they recognized the ultimate futility of such a project.  This is interesting. Could you illustrate how they came to recognize the ultimate futility of ""preserving the knowledge of the past and the present for the future""?           The source does not expand on this point, I'm afraid. Anything further would be speculation on my part. Do you think I should remove that sentence?  Awadewit  |  talk  19:29, 14 December 2007 (UTC)           You fixed it.

Awadewit  |  talk  19:29, 14 December 2007 (UTC)         Out of personal interest, was the  Anti-Jacobin  anything more than an archnemesis looking back now, given history? I was amused by this section, recalling the feud between  The Voice  and the  NYPress  in the 90s. The  Anti-Jacobin  also came off as angry the way a Wikipedian can get when they detect POV in an article.- BillDeanCarter  ( talk ) 09:36, 14 December 2007 (UTC)         The  Anti-Jacobin  was basically a reactive publication. You might think of it as  The Weekly Standard  as well. It didn't last much longer than the political events that it was reacting to. It was indeed a very angry paper. Its review of  Mary Wollstonecraft's  novel  Maria: or, The Wrongs of Woman , for example, is vicious as its review of  William Godwin's   Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman . The review basically calls Wollstonecraft a whore.  Awadewit  |  talk  19:29, 14 December 2007 (UTC)           Wow.

Thanks,  APR Â  t  01:22, 19 December 2007 (UTC)       [ edit ]   Comments by Mike Christie     I'd like to see something in the lead about the importance of the AR in literary history. I gather from the body of the article that this is one of the more important literary periodicals of its day; perhaps the most important? Can it be regarded merely as part of the Republic of Letters, or did it mark a new departure in radicalism, in print at least? I think much of this information can be gleaned from the body, but a sentence or two in the lead would be useful, perhaps at the end, where a summarizing statement about the magazine's importance, influence and legacy would fit naturally.           It is always hard to say what  the most  important journal was, but this was probably not it. In the eighteenth century,  The Spectator (1711)  would probably win that award. I don't think that the AR was a ""new departure in radicalism"", either - at least not new enough to make a big hullabaloo about in the lead. I want to be careful not to oversell the AR. It was important, but it was not the only periodical of its day. I have reorganized the lead a bit to make the journal's political threat clearer which may help to make its importance clearer, but I am wary of overstating the journal's significance. There are very few sources on this journal, so I feel that I need to be careful about making overblown claims.  Awadewit  |  talk  04:54, 30 December 2007 (UTC)           The additional phrase ""Perhaps most importantly"" is the sort of thing I was looking for -- I wasn't looking necessarily for an assertion that it was significant, just a statement of what its significance was. I think this is enough.  Mike Christie   (talk)  12:01, 30 December 2007 (UTC)               Linking  travel literature  but not  belles lettres  seems odd; of that list, only ""belles lettres"" might need elucidation for the average reader. I'd link it and unlink travel literature.           I've linked both as  travel literature  could be a very interesting article someday.  Awadewit  |  talk  05:06, 30 December 2007 (UTC)           Seems reasonable.  Mike Christie   (talk)  12:01, 30 December 2007 (UTC)               This periodical ceased publication just before the death of its proprietor.  ""This periodical"" is a little clunky. I'd suggest we only need to know about Maty's death if it's related to the cessation of publication -- e.g. he was ill and had to cease publication before he died because of his illness. If the source doesn't say, I'd drop the sentence completely; if it does say, I'd restructure the sentence to start with the information instead.           Deleted sentence - no other information is known.  Awadewit  |  talk  05:06, 30 December 2007 (UTC)       OK.  Mike Christie   (talk)  12:01, 30 December 2007 (UTC)           There was a vacuum waiting to be filled by the demise of the Theological Repository and the New Review.  I don't think this means what you want it to: surely you mean that the demise of the TR and NR left a vacuum, which was waiting to be filled? Actually I'd cut that last clause; vacuums are always waiting to be filled. Or am I missing your meaning?           Now reads:  The demise of the  Theological Repository  and the  New Review  left a vacuum and the arrival in London of the author  Thomas Christie , who was dedicated to starting a new periodical that would replace and perhaps even improve upon these forerunners, was the primary impetus in the creation of the  Analytical Review .   Awadewit  |  talk  05:06, 30 December 2007 (UTC)           That works.  Mike Christie   (talk)  12:01, 30 December 2007 (UTC)               You might eliminate one use of ""forerunner""; it's a highly visible word and you use it three times (counting the section title) in a fairly short space.           Oops - changed last one to ""precursors"".  Awadewit  |  talk  05:06, 30 December 2007 (UTC)           OK.  Mike Christie   (talk)  12:01, 30 December 2007 (UTC)               First para of ""Founding and ideals""; the Roper cite gives us a definite "" was  the primary impetus"", but the Tyson cite weakens this to ""probably resulted in"". Is there a distinction here? I'd guess the message is that Christie's arrival is agreed to be the key event, but the way in which the decision was taken to found the AR is only ""probably"" identified. If so, it might be easier to phrase this clearly by integrating both comments and citing both sources at the end of the paragraph (clarifying in the footnote what comes from which source, if necessary).           Johnson and Christie shared many of the same friends, such as Priestley, and their combined interest in beginning such a journal probably resulted in the foundation of the Review.  - The ""probably"" is supposed to apply to the statement about their combined interest - how can I make that clearer?  Awadewit  |  talk  05:06, 30 December 2007 (UTC)           I had to stop and think about this for a minute. Initially I was going to suggest a rewrite such as ""and it was probably their combined interest"", but something about that sounds odd. It could be read as ""The probable reason they started the journal is because they were all interested in starting such a journal"", which doesn't sound very informative. I'm sorry if I'm being dense here, but I don't quite see what the Tyson quote adds. Please feel free to ignore my comment here if you're confident it conveys what it should.  Mike Christie   (talk)  12:01, 30 December 2007 (UTC)    I just removed the ""probably"" - I'm probably (!) being overcareful here and the point is not really important anyway.  Awadewit  |  talk  15:04, 30 December 2007 (UTC)    OK, that's probably good enough.Â :o)  Mike Christie   (talk)  15:46, 30 December 2007 (UTC)                       The criticism of Gibbon is a nice quote; can it be cited back to the original AR issue, via the source that quotes it?           It would actually be much harder for anyone who wanted to check this quotation to get a copy of the  Analytical Review  than for them to get a copy of the book I cited it from. I think it is best to cite from the book. (The  Analytical Review  is only available in its original form in rare books libraries or on microfilm at research libraries.)  Awadewit  |  talk  05:06, 30 December 2007 (UTC)           OK. I tend to like to add cites back to the primary sources in addition to the secondary ones, using a cite of the form ""cite A, quoted in cite B"", but you're right that it really wouldn't add much value for most readers here.  Mike Christie   (talk)  12:01, 30 December 2007 (UTC)    If I can find the original, I'll do this.  Awadewit  |  talk  15:04, 30 December 2007 (UTC)    Added.  Awadewit  |  talk  21:25, 4 January 2008 (UTC)                       seeming collusion : I'm not sure of your point. Why would collusion occur if the full names of reviewers were used? Because the authors would then know who the reviewers were and could contact them in order to collude? Is literary society at that date small enough that this would be expected? The examples you give (Fuseli and Wollstonecraft) don't seem to fit with that explanation; and in fact those examples seem to illustrate the perils of anonymity, rather than the existence of collusion.           Yes, the community was that small - everybody knew everybody and was friends/enemies with everybody. I agree that the example doesn't work well. Now explained better:  It was also meant to prevent any unethical puffing, or false advertising, of friends' or one's own books, but this also occurred: both Henry Fuseli and Mary Wollstonecraft reviewed their own books for the journal, for example.   Awadewit  |  talk  05:17, 30 December 2007 (UTC)           Well, if the sources say that's what it was meant to prevent, then OK, but I don't see how it was supposed to do that. Why wouldn't anonymity make the unethical puffing much more likely to happen (as it did happen)?  Mike Christie   (talk)  12:01, 30 December 2007 (UTC)    Anonymity was supposed to represent objectivity - that it did not work like that in practice is clear. However, the theory was mixing reviewers' names with writers' names would taint the project. It is a different idea of how anonymity operates.  Awadewit  |  talk  15:04, 30 December 2007 (UTC)    I'm striking this since I now understand it and there's nothing inaccurate in the article. If you think other readers might fail to understand, perhaps some additional explanation of the point in the article would be useful.  Mike Christie   (talk)  15:46, 30 December 2007 (UTC)                       Yet, they recognized the ultimate futility of such a project.  I agree with BillDeanCarter's comment, above, that this sentence piques the reader's interest. It's a pity it can't be expanded, but I think it should stay, even so. However, anything else you can find on this would be very interesting. A separate point: I don't like to see a sentence start with ""Yet"" followed by a comma, but perhaps this is an American usage.           It is American.Â :)  Awadewit  |  talk  05:17, 30 December 2007 (UTC)           OK. You'd think I'd know American usage by now, but sometimes I think that living on both sides of the Atlantic has just confused me as to what usage belongs on which side.  Mike Christie   (talk)  12:01, 30 December 2007 (UTC)               It also emphasized the emerging middle-class Protestant work ethic, specifically tying it to scientific knowledge.  Sorry if I'm being slow here, but I don't follow this. I think ""tying"" is not the right verb here, or at least I'm having trouble with it. Do you mean ""specifically asserting that it was a natural consequence of an interest in scientific knowledge""? The subsequent quote seems to imply that reading. ""Tying"" doesn't give a direction or mechanism for causality, and I think you need to be clear here.           Perhaps ""tying"" is a lit crit word. How about:  It also emphasized the emerging middle-class Protestant work ethic, associating it with scientific knowledge.  - There is no cause-effect link - there is only an associative link - if you have one, you have the other.  Awadewit  |  talk  05:17, 30 December 2007 (UTC)           That was how I read ""tying"", so I don't think it's a lit-crit usage -- I just was unsure that that was the intention. I think I would prefer ""associating"".  Mike Christie   (talk)  12:01, 30 December 2007 (UTC)               several luminaries, such as: the poet William Cowper : I think that colon should go.           But a whole list follows - usually colons precede lists like that.  Awadewit  |  talk  05:17, 30 December 2007 (UTC)           It's the use of ""such as"" with the colon which I think is wrong. Take a look at  [5]  which gives that as an example -- I've no idea how authoritative that source is; I just wanted to link to an example showing I'm not on out on my own on this one. I would drop the colon myself, but I think you could legitimately keep it and drop ""such as"".  Mike Christie   (talk)  12:01, 30 December 2007 (UTC)    Removed.  Awadewit  |  talk  21:25, 4 January 2008 (UTC)                   Therefore, circulation numbers :""Therefore"" is a bit clunky to my ear. Perhaps ""Hence"", and cut out the comma?           Changed, but retained comma (must be an American comma rule - it is appropriate there).  Awadewit  |  talk  05:17, 30 December 2007 (UTC)           OK.  Mike Christie   (talk)  12:01, 30 December 2007 (UTC)               Beginning with its third issue, Mary Wollstonecraft was the key editor for dramas, romances, and novels for the Analytical Review.  A couple of things I would suggest here. First, I'd use a verb of change such as ""became"" rather than ""was"". Second, I think ""its"" is rather distracting, since the referent is deferred right to the end of the sentence. Can the AR be named at the start of the sentence instead, or another rephrasing be found?           Changed.  Awadewit  |  talk  05:27, 30 December 2007 (UTC)           Much better.  Mike Christie   (talk)  12:01, 30 December 2007 (UTC)               The sentence beginning  Wollstonecraft wrote excoriating reviews  is a little long, and you might consider breaking it at the colon. The embedded quote in the second half is also somewhat hard to parse; I assume that this is Myers quoting Wollstonecraft. The elisions within both inner and outer quotes make this a rather disrupting sentence to read. Not sure what can be done here, but if you can simplify the presentation (perhaps by eliding less?) that would be nice.           New version:  Wollstonecraft wrote excoriating reviews, criticizing the passive novelistic heroines of the time and praising, for example, the ""wise and resilient"" Mrs. Stafford of Charlotte Smiths autobiographical novel Emmeline (1788). Wollstonecraft ""singles out...the knowledgeable mother figure who has felt and thought deeply"", a character who resembles the women she described in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman as having ""power...over themselves"".[7] She derides the ""derivative, prescriptive, imitative, and affected"" and celebrates ""natural, innovative, imaginative, and real, true feeling"".[8]   Awadewit  |  talk  05:27, 30 December 2007 (UTC)           The rephrasing is a definite improvement. I'm having second thoughts about splitting the sentence: you now have four sentences in a row starting ""Wollstonecraft"", ""Wollstonecraft"", ""She"", ""She""; the repetitive form is a little wearying on the ear. It's difficult to restructure because the nature of the sentences is consecutive reporting of what Wollstonecraft wrote. I'll think some more about this and post any bright ideas I get. One possibility: is there some introductory phrase that could be used in the second or perhaps third sentence, such as ""According to Myers""?  Mike Christie   (talk)  12:01, 30 December 2007 (UTC)    I noticed that as well, but couldn't come up with a solution at the time. It will come to us.  Awadewit  |  talk  15:04, 30 December 2007 (UTC)    Striking; it's good enough, and as you say a solution will occur to one of us.  Mike Christie   (talk)  15:46, 30 December 2007 (UTC)    I think I have improved this.  Awadewit  |  talk  21:25, 4 January 2008 (UTC)                           The extensive coverage of Wollstonecraft in the ""Organization and Reviewers"" section is interesting, but I feel obliged to ask if this accurately reflects the amount of scholarship on the various reviewers. Pardon me for checking, but I know Wollstonecraft is someone you know a great deal about and so would have an easy time finding sources for. Of the list of reviewers, I'd have said Cowper was the best-known, with Wollstonecraft probably second, yet there's little about Cowper in the article. So can you confirm that this does reflect the relative weight of the sources?           As far as I know, more information is available on Wollstonecraft than the other reviewers. I've even had trouble finding out who the other reviewers were. I keep adding information as I find it, but it is usually only a line or two. I agree that this disproportionate weight to Wollstonecraft is not ideal and I keep trying to rectify it, but so far I have had very little success.  Awadewit  |  talk  05:27, 30 December 2007 (UTC)           That's fine, then; if it reflects what you've found then there's no problem.  Mike Christie   (talk)  12:01, 30 December 2007 (UTC)             That's all I have time for tonight; more when I can. Let me know if these comments are useful.  Mike Christie   (talk)  04:08, 27 December 2007 (UTC)   Comments on the second half:     The list of works at the start of the ""Content"" section should have an ""and"" between "" Military Operations on the Coromandel Coast "" and "" Poetry and Musuic of the Italian Opera "".           But there is an ""in addition to"" at the end of the list.  Awadewit  |  talk  05:27, 30 December 2007 (UTC)           To my ear that doesn't excuse it, but let's leave it and we'll see if anyone else objects.  Mike Christie   (talk)  12:01, 30 December 2007 (UTC)               My French is weak, but I think it should be ""Rvolution"", with an acute accent.       In the book I copied the title from, there is no accent.  Awadewit  |  talk  21:25, 4 January 2008 (UTC)       The journal also laid provocative facts before the public in order to provoke them to think and, if necessary, to take actionit claimed not to champion one viewpoint over another.  Can you avoid using both ""provocative"" and ""provoke"" so close together? I also think the dash does not work well as a conjunction here; I think its intended meaning is something like ""although"", and perhaps the final clause can be parenthetical, since your subsequent examples only exemplify the laying of provocative facts, not the failure to champion any particular viewpoint.           Fixed ""provoke"" situation - changed to ""promote"".   Changed dash to ""although"".   Did not make the final clause parenthetical, as the next paragraph explains the political viewpoint of the journal. These opening sentences are meant to be a sort of summary of the section.  Awadewit  |  talk  05:36, 30 December 2007 (UTC)           That works for me.  Mike Christie   (talk)  12:01, 30 December 2007 (UTC)               Consistent with Joseph Johnson's attitudes : this sounds wrong to me. You could make ""consistent"" adverbial in form, though ""consistently"" is an ugly way to start the sentence; or you could reconstruct the phrasing to say something like ""The Analytical Review tended towards a ""moderate radicalism"", which was consistent with Joseph Johnson's attitudes; this meant that it opposed the Pitt administration and celebrated the general values of Paine's  Rights of Man .""           I'm sorry, I don't understand why it is wrong.  Awadewit  |  talk  05:36, 30 December 2007 (UTC)           I'm not enough of a formal grammarian to be able to explicitly detail what sounds wrong to me here. Perhaps the problem is that this is a dangling clause? My reading of examples of dangling modifiers doesn't seem to quite fit this case, so I hesitate to accuse you of such a sin. Let's just leave it that I don't like the way it sounds, and wait and see if anyone else comments.  Mike Christie   (talk)  12:01, 30 December 2007 (UTC)               reiterated the protections  -- I don't think one can reiterate a protection; probably should be ""reiterated a defence of the protections"". What is the first iteration that this repeats, though?           Changed to ""outlined"". Don't know if I like that, but it is what I could think of at the time.  Awadewit  |  talk  05:36, 30 December 2007 (UTC)           I think that does the trick.  Mike Christie   (talk)  12:01, 30 December 2007 (UTC)               Christie attempted to assuage these fears in his advertisement : I think this should be ""an advertisement"" unless you can more precisely identify the advertisement in question (which might be interesting to do in any case -- e.g. where was this advertisement placed?).           The sources say ""the advertisement"". Oftentimes, an early advertisement was released for new projects in the eighteenth century. It would not have been placed in any particular publication - it would have been a free-floating piece of paper - posted up around town, handed out, etc.  Awadewit  |  talk  05:57, 30 December 2007 (UTC)           OK, that clears it up.  Mike Christie   (talk)  12:01, 30 December 2007 (UTC)               Furthermore, Johnson chose as his theological reviewer, not a Dissenter : I'd suggest cutting the comma after ""reviewer"".           More American commas, I suppose.  Awadewit  |  talk  05:57, 30 December 2007 (UTC)           I'll take your word for it.  Mike Christie   (talk)  12:01, 30 December 2007 (UTC)               Looking back over the article, I've just realized that there are no dates for issues of the magazine. The ""Founding"" section doesn't give dates for Christie's arrival in London, or the discussions with Christie (if any dates are known), or the first issue. I think the lead is the only place you say that 1788 was when the magazine began. The first issue date at least should be in the body of the article.           We don't know the exact date of Christie's arrival in London. I'm not sure I have access to the issue information. It is not in any of the sources I have read and I'm not sure I have access to the AR itself (I don't right now - that would have to wait until I returned to my university).  Awadewit  |  talk  05:57, 30 December 2007 (UTC)           I'd say the issue information would be worth adding when you get back.  Mike Christie   (talk)  12:01, 30 December 2007 (UTC)    Added to the ""Founding and ideals"" section.  Awadewit  |  talk  21:25, 4 January 2008 (UTC)                   ""frequently review the Monthly, criticise the Critical, and analyse the Analytical Reviews"" [sic] [emphasis in original] : a copy-editing question: should ""[sic]"" be inside the quotes? It applies only to "" Analytical Reviews "", not the whole quote. And I think you can use parentheses rather than square brackets for ""emphasis in the original"", given that it doesn't have to be within the quotes.           [ sic ] now inside the quotes - I don't know how that happened.   I prefer the square brackets on ""emphasis in the original"" just for the sake of clarity.  Awadewit  |  talk  05:57, 30 December 2007 (UTC)       OK.  Mike Christie   (talk)  12:01, 30 December 2007 (UTC)           This sincere attitude seems to have largely prevailed in practice.  Given the statement that ""contemporaries perceived a bias"", and particularly given the existence and the attitude of the  Anti-Jacobin Review , this is a remarkable assertion. Can you just confirm that it is supported by a consensus of the secondary sources?           Yes. Ask  Willow  - she has read about this topic. I find it odd, too, but that is what they say. (However, keep in mind that this ""consensus"" of secondary sources is about 3-4 sources.)  Awadewit  |  talk  05:57, 30 December 2007 (UTC)           If the sources agree on this (and 3-4 is enough) then there's no problem.

Changed.  Awadewit  |  talk  21:25, 4 January 2008 (UTC)           Can you expand the caption to the advertisement for the New Series to note that it's an advertisement? It's apparent that it is from reading it, but the caption actually misleads the reader a little bit right now. Personally I'd like to see you note where the advertisement was published. That applies to the original prospectus, and to the advertisement mentioned earlier where Johnson defends the  Review's  neutrality, too, but I don't know if others would find that interesting.     That's everything I can see. Overall the article is well-structured and clearly written. I found it fascinating; thanks for the opportunity to review this.  Mike Christie   (talk)  13:23, 27 December 2007 (UTC)         You're too kind.   Expanded caption for the  Analytical Review (New Series) .           I'd assumed it was an advertisement because of the phrase ""On the 1st of March will be published"", but if you say it's the title page that settles that.  Mike Christie   (talk)  12:01, 30 December 2007 (UTC)    Title pages sometimes doubled as advertisements in the eighteenth century - it lowered printing costs.  Awadewit  |  talk  15:10, 30 December 2007 (UTC)               The advertisements weren't published anywhere that we would be able to identify. See answer above.  Awadewit  |  talk  05:57, 30 December 2007 (UTC)           OK.  Mike Christie   (talk)  12:01, 30 December 2007 (UTC)                   This is wonderful!

Awadewit  |  talk  15:04, 30 December 2007 (UTC)       Not a problem.

Perhaps ""The band originally comprised of the three brothers Pete, Sam, and Joe Loeffler, but Joe left the band in 2005 due to internal differences and was replaced by Dean Bernardini soon after.""   Could we perhaps caption the infobox image to say which band members can be seen?   ""their parents garage."" Apostrophe use!   ""favorite car Chevrolet Chevelle.""

""It is unclear whether he was fired or if he left the band due to different stories from the band members."" Confusing sentence. Try ""Due to different stories from the band members, it is unclear whether he was fired or left the band of his own accord."" or something akin.

""However Joe has a different side to the story,"" Maybe ""However, according to _____, Joe said of his departure-""   ""with a new permenant bassist, Dean Bernardini.[14][19]"" Do we have any information about how they got Bernardini?   Oh, wait there, you explain that in the next paragraph- could you perhaps avoid the crossover? State that they got him as the new bassist,  then  talk about the tour?   Also, the next paragraph talks about Joe's departure. Lose that, you have already talked about it,  especially  as you imply he was fired, which we can't do.   The last paragraph in 2004-2006 and the first in 2006-present really need fixing.   ""the band's brother in-law and long time"" He isn't the band's brother-in-law.

As a general comment, if you are intending to seek FA status, you should attempt to find some secondary sources as refs, such as books about the battles in which they fought. I am not too excited about these regimental histories that are often simply rehashes of web summaries.     Unit histories generally include the dates of command for their commanders.   What is the meaning of ""distinguished themselves for their foul conduct""?   ""O'Brian was also short lived"" -- does that mean he died?   It is not good practice to hardcode thumbnail sizes because users can set their preferred size; I removed these.

I'm no expert on this historical period, but the article seems fairly comprehensive. I did have a couple minor concerns, however. First, there are stylistic inconsistencies in the references section. Look closely at the two published secondary sources in this section (Foner's overview of Reconstruction and the 19th-century historical text). This problem can be handled in a minute. Secondly, you might mention that cynicism about the war was common among New York's working-class whites well before the draft riots. The draft riots were an  expression  of longstanding attitudes of resentment and disillusionment toward the war. This terrible episode raises a couple of questions. Why were so many of the city's poor whites out of sympathy with the stated ideals of the Union cause? Why did they target African Americans, who were, if anything, worse off than them? Answers to these questions will shed light on a question more central to your topic: Why did volunteer recruitment ""stall.""

I'm great with lists, not a much with prose. I had thought about the POV nature of the section titles. Without titles though, I feel that the dates come across as completely arbitrary. That said, ""Growing pains"" and ""Decline"" are probably the only two section titles that are POV, I would think. Not sure how else to name them, but I'll think on it. Same with the lead. I might just remove that ""only team to retain its name"" bit and combine to three paragraphs. That really is just trivia, and hard to source.

I understand he played ""back in the day"" when appearances were hard to come by but I'm not sure that his inclusion isn't POV, he's the only one that doesn't meet any specific criteria.   ""no other player comes close."" - is this necessary? It'd be worth stating who came second and how far behind they were I reckon.   ""still active for the club"" - not sure this is really a football term. I think it's probably an Americanism, maybe just ""still play for the club"" would be more Brit-Eng?

It makes me wonder how many terrible massacres have occurred throughout human history, and especially most recently. My comments are:     The lede should state where the massacre took place right away, which is in the then capital of the Republic of China. Perhaps copy something out of the  Nanking Massacre  article. Also maybe mention the historical context of this massacre. Was it the only massacre done by the Japanese Army. Also, why were they doing it? Why were they there? Maybe even convey what the book revealed that had been forgotten. Although this article's about the book, it presents important facts and you want the lede to basically give the reader a complete picture. So because the history is so important, the lede should tell you more about it.   Also, mention in the lede how Chang took her own life which is sad.   See  WP:MOSQUOTE  and  WP:PUNC  - Punctuation goes outside of the quotation mark for incomplete sentences. The punctuation doesn't conform throughout the article, starting with  In the introduction of The Rape of Nanking, she wrote that throughout her childhood, the Nanking Massacre ""remained buried in the back of [her] mind as a metaphor for unspeakable evil.""   Why didn't  The San Francisco Chronicle  publish her rebuttal? Was it cowardice or something else? Surely, they should have. Who did publish it?   In the lede mention that the book was published in English, and that a Japanese language edition was never published due to the controversial publishing practices, and Chang's refusal to submit to them.     Overall excellent and really the only issues are with the lede, and you definitely know this topic inside out. Best of luck as you proceed towards FA.- BillDeanCarter  ( talk ) 20:09, 15 December 2007 (UTC)     Thanks for the comments, especially about how to use quotes - that has always been confusing to me but was one thing I was too lazy to go and read about.

If I'm right she was so traumatised by the research on the massacre that it was the main reason she ""lost it"" in her last years?   I would propose merging the criticism section with the ""reponse to criticism"" bit. The critical review mentioned in the latter is confusing to lead off a section titled ""response"". Put that review in criticism and then have a sub-heading for the attempted response. It slots in much better that way.

First of all I would lose this sentence  It does not however include full details of the current season.  in the lead. Then I would lose the current season details. It looks confusing and is unnecessary. It will need updating regularly, which isn't necessarily too difficult, but also readers who aren't au fait with everything football might not realise the season is complete or Leeds have already been knocked out of the FA Cup, etc.    As noted in the footnotes it doesn't need updating again till the end of the season.

Buc  ( talk ) 21:40, 18 December 2007 (UTC)    Because a non-football reader may not realise the season isn't over. It needs to be all-inclusive.

Was told I need this to make it a FL. Removed.  Buc  ( talk ) 17:44, 18 December 2007 (UTC)    Yes, you will need an image for FL. But it really ought to be a relevant image. Maybe that image was relevant but the caption needed to be relevant to the article, i.e. something like Billy Bremner, who won X, Y and Z, during his career at Leeds from 19xx to 19yy.

Try ""were unsuccessful""   Same section: ""reverse the team's fortunes in a dramatic way"" informal, uses peacock words   Section title: ""Plunge to the lottery"": rather jargony. Non-NBA fans have NO idea what this means.   Probably lots of other language issues. I am NOT a good copy editor. Consider seeking the help of the  league of copy editors  for help with this.       Organization issues:    summary style  issues. When you split a section into a new article, there is no need for the section to remain as long as the daughter article. For example, the ""History"" section is WAY too long and excessively detailed in places. Consider paring it down to the highlights, and move the details to the daughter article. Think about ""lead"" sized (or maybe slightly larger). I would think you could pare the history section down to like 3-5 paragraphs total. If its long enough to have subsections, its too long in this case.   The section on transactions also has the same problem. Consider reducing ALL sections on players down to a single section. ""Notable players"" and spliting info to other articles. Under notable players, it is probably OK to significantly limit this to players of real distinction (such as Hall of Famers or Top 50 all-time players, like Pippin). We don't need every single draft pick the team has ever made here.   This article should be the kind of article where someone who knows next-to-nothing about the Blazers would get a general overview of the team. The daughter articles (like a Players article, and a Seasons article and the like) would be the place to get more details. Consider the following organizational scheme:    Name and branding (condense the Blazermania stuff into here)   History (condense some of the ""and the media"" stuff into here too...)   Players    Notable past players (keep it about MAJOR players, such as retired numbers, hall-of-famers, and Top 50s (like Pippen)   Current players       Coaching staff   Front office   Media personel (keep on the personalities, like radio and TV play-by-play etc.)   Team and league records (include team record holders, league record holders, championships won, overall and playoff records, etc.)   Venue       Consider the following ""Daughter"" articles to take up the details from this one. Some of these probably already exist:    History article   Players and coaches article (include sections on draft picks, all stars, major trades, retired numbers etc.)   Seasons article (several NFL teams have featured seasons articles... try  Chicago Bears seasons  for a great example)             That should give you enough to work on.

This ""curse"" is analagous to the  Curse_of_the_bambino . However, this ""Curse of Doug Flutie"" is said to affect the Buffalo Bills.   Personally, I do not believe in this curse - I am a scientist and engineer - but it has been discussed at various websites and has been eloquently described at ColdHardFootballFacts.com. Here in Buffalo where I am, it is commonly discussed. Considering that the Bills playoff drought may extend another year this year and that the Bills are tied with the Lions for the second longest playoff drought in the NFL, it should be understandable how, in a city famous for losing, such a ""curse"" could arise in the consciousness of Bills fans.   Below is the specific text that I wish to add to the Buffalo Bills section of the Doug Flutie article, but that Student7 subsequently deletes:   BEGIN ARTICLE ADDITION The Bills have never won a playoff game since Phillips replaced Flutie with Johnson and some say this began the ""Flutie Curse"". Coldhardfootballfacts.com has a more detailed description of the origin of the curse in their article  Icy Issues: Curse of Flutie & Peyton Whats-it?  END ARTICLE ADDITION   I cannot speak for Student7's reasons for deletion. However, I do not see how the Flutie Curse is any less worthy than the Curse of the Bambino other than the Bambino Curse is more well known having existed for decades, while the Flutie Curse is, so far, not quite 10 years old.

I realise that there are sources listed at the bottom, but a GA/FA is expected to have in-line references against all the key facts.

A couple more things really jump out as per  WP:MOS  are linking to relevant pages, like competitions (particularly in the honours section), years in football, and the ground section; making sure years use endashes, e.g. 200708, and in results e.g. 10; and I'm not sure you need all the club officials, e.g. marketing manager, masseur, etc, etc - just the key ones.     Done       Notable former players is also  WP:POV . If you can change this section to either prose, or as a list of players who went on to play league football with maybe the header to see the relevant category.

Here are a few suggestions:    The bulleted list at the end of the lead should be converted into prose. Also the lead isn't really a  consise summary of the article .   A number of the sections are inadequately referenced, or not at all. I should expect to see about 1-2 references per paragraph.   The first usage of a unit should be wikilinked, as per ""23u"".   Please run the page through a spelling/grammar checker. I'm finding errors such as ""travelled"", ""accelarates"", ""ionisation"", ""analyser"" and ""Labelling"". (Unless these are British English spellings.) Is ""quantitation"" a word?   There are too many one-sentence paragraphs. Most of these should be expanded or merged. There may also be too many one-paragraph sections. In the ""Other Separation Techniques Combined with Mass spectrometry"" section, for example, I'm not sure I see the benefit of three different one-paragraph sections. That would work just as well with wikilinks in place of the ""See also the main article on..."".   I shouldn't be seeing the article title repeated in the table of contents, per  Wikipedia:MoS#Section_headings .   Most of your references appear to be in decent shape, with the exception of note #29, which consists of just a link.   You may need to clean out some of the External links section per the tag.   I'd like to see a few more illustrations in the article to help out with the concepts.       Thank you.

All ideas welcome.  Rt .  21:50, 17 December 2007 (UTC)     Y   Done Why are the table headers in a blueish colour?    Y  - Changed to black (#000000) in line with other lists with similar tables.  Rt .  19:10, 18 December 2007 (UTC)       Y   Done Is there a particular reason why the former Bank of England is not linked?    N  - The article doesn't exist. Perhaps a creation needed?  Rt .  19:10, 18 December 2007 (UTC)    Nothing wrong with it being a redlink if it doesn't yet exist but is notable enough for an article.  Oldelpaso  ( talk ) 23:07, 18 December 2007 (UTC)           The location column does not give much insight to someone unfamiliar with the city. Perhaps a map indicating the location of each building would be a useful addition.   In spite of Manchester's medieval history  - not sure about this phrase. It provokes the question ""what medieval history, and why is it important""?   This may be due to my personal preferences for this type of article, but I think a longer prose section would be beneficial. Something like a paragraph which briefly explains what each building is, so the reader does not have to go to each building's article to find out.     How would that be written? It would be hard to write about everything, but at the same time, trying to prevent it from being too long.  Rt .  19:12, 18 December 2007 (UTC)    Going completely off the top of my head here, but a starter might be ""The oldest listed building in the city is  Manchester Cathedral . Completed in 1421, it is one of three Grade I listed religious buildings in Manchester..."" Presumably construction of the commercial buildings in the list (Liverpool Rd Station, former Bank of England) coincided with a period of prosperity. In essence, the themes from the second paragraph could be integrated with information about some of the items in the list. As I say, this may be a matter of personal taste, I like list articles with  meaty prose sections .   Another thing I've noticed - none of the buildings in the list are Edwardian seeing as the most recent is 1899.  Oldelpaso  ( talk ) 23:07, 18 December 2007 (UTC)             Hope this helps.

A few points:     Though the intro mentions the diplomatic significance of the treaty for Britain (the end of splendid isolation) it does not say anything about the significance for Japan.   It is stated that negotiations began when Russia began to move into China. What war/battle/conflict was this? Can we describe it a bit further or provide a wikilink to the appropriate conflict article?   A great many events, including the  Triple Intervention , the  Russo-Japanese War , the Japanese acquisition of German Pacific territories, and of Korea, are described only in passing, with extremely little detail given. I'm not sure whether or not it would be appropriate to suggest that expansion be done on these points... if there are relevant things to be said in regards to Japan's relationship with the UK, they should be said. But I'm afraid that I'm not so knowledgeable on this Alliance and its impact.   The cultural interactions between the countries could afford to be explained further; or, a few links could be placed in a See Also section. Can we work in a mention of the  Japan-British Exhibition (1910) ?     I can't quite put my finger on it, but somehow the article overall seems a bit too vague, and too scattered. It's a fine start, but somehow or other I feel it needs to be both expanded upon and tightened up. Still, thanks for your excellent work thus far. Keep it up!!

Consider rewording.    N   Not done  I could not think of anything other than that to start it, but since its the same on all similar pages, I decided to just keep it.       The Redskins won the ... also played in and lost  can be condensed to pipe-link the years, i.e.:  won the  1937  and  1942  NFL championships and Super Bowls ...     Y   Done  done.       Only three teams have appeared ... : change  Redskins' five  to just  Redskins . Express the count of five in the next sentence, adding something like  with five  to the end.     Y   Done  completed.       The ""periods of success"" should be refined (as a nontitle year could still be considered successful) to state, for example,  All of the Redskins league titles were attained during two ten-year spans. From 1936 to 1945...     Y   Done  Did it, but could not think of anything for period of failure.       A brief explanation of the differences in division titles (pre-1970, post-1970), league titles (Super Bowl era/before) and Wild Card qualification (pre- and post-realignment) would aid the understanding. Wikilink to  History of National Football League Championship , because it doesn't need to be an exhaustive explanation.    N   Not done  not sure what that means       Abbreviationssuch as COY, ROY, BBAshould be defined in a footnote or next to the color key. Or better yet, spell it out (there's enough room) on at least the first reference. Per  WP:EGG .     Y   Done  I wrote them out in full during their first reference. I don't know if I like too much how it looks, but if people want it, they got it.       Spell out Cleveland in C. Rams. I would also spell out L.A., but I could concede based on the ubiquitousness of the abbreviation. Maybe note somewhere about your convention of listing the city name if the opponent has since left that city.     Y   Done  completed.       Conventionally,  postseason  is used rather than  playoffs  when referring to win-loss records of such.  Divisional Playoffs  and  Wild Card Playoffs  are proper terminology. Also the header for that column should be one word  Postseason .     Y   Done  completed.       The Eastern Division playoff existed as a tiebreaker, as a variant of the modern tiebreaker system. Therefore, the  1st  in 1943 does not require unique highlighting. It should be highlighted as a division title. Those games are considered by the NFL to be equivalent to the Divisional Playoffs of today. Remove the one-game playoff from the key as well.     Y   Done  completed.       Use footnotes to explain tiebreakers, much like  Browns  and  Patriots , just not as wordy as those.     Y   Done  completed.       Thumbs up for thorough references.    Thanks.

I'd suggest you remove these images and move up the other images of the lyrics and the sheet music. If available, you could use portraits of the authors of the national anthem.   I think you don't need the ""See also"" section for this article. I would suggest you'd remove it entirely.   You could wikilink some dates that give context, see  Wikipedia:Context  and  Wikipedia:Manual of Style (dates)  for more info.   I think you should, generally, wikilink more words in the article that are relevant to its topic, such as the words ""music"" and ""lyrics"" in the lead.   I am not sure the lead section is a good stand alone summary of the article. I'd suggest you make sure all information in the lead section is also in the article, then delete the lead and write a new section that summarizes the complete article.

In the lede:     killed by police on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation during an attempt to arrest him.  - you should tack on the reason he was arrested.   During a struggle between his followers and police, he was killed by the police.  - instead of .. ""he was killed by the police"" which sounds repetitious explain in more detail his gruesome death in which several officers did this and that.   His body was taken to nearby Fort Yates for burial, but in 1953, his remains possibly were exhumed and reburied near Mobridge, South Dakota.  Why the possibly? Incorporate the explanation into the sentence.   As a youth, Slow excelled at foot races, games, and was an expert horseback rider and was very accurate with bow and arrow.[3]  What kind of games? Monopoly, paintball, ...?   For this, Slow earned a white eagle feather, symbol of a first coup, and also received the name of his father. His father changed his name to Jumping Bull, and henceforth Slow would be known as Tatanka-Iyotanka, or Sitting Bull.[5] It was also at this ceremony that Sitting Bull received his shield.  Add some extra description about the tradition of taking your father's name after a triumphant battle, just like you explain other traditions very well in the following paragraphs. I would also explain the receiving of the shield.   The Early adulthood section is stubby. Maybe elaborate on the two sentence paragraph?   However, Sitting Bull also knew techniques of healing and carried medical herbs, though he was not a medicine man.  Is it medical herbs or medicinal herbs? I myself am not sure. Maybe you know?   Briefly explain the reason for The Dakota War of 1862. You tackle the warrior life well, but there's a lack of historical context given and the reader will want to know. Was it all to stop some general campaign by the U.S.? What were the times Sitting Bull lived in?   In 1863, Hunkpapa warriors (probably including Sitting Bull) joined with Dakota refugee warriors to fight against the military. However, Col. Henry Sibley defeated them at the Battle of Dead Buffalo Lake on July 26 and at the Battle of Stony Lake on July 28.[16] Sitting Bull also possibly took part among other Hunkpapa warriors in the Battle of Whitestone Hill, on September 3.  Explain the reasoning behind ""probably including Sitting Bull"" and ""possibly took part"". Maybe historians which think so, and a statement from them? A quote from an author of a respected book on the subject. Or the evidence contrary or supportive. It's just when facts are dubious you want to know why.   The last two paragraphs of the Fame section are unreferenced.   Excellent Legacy section.

Thanks,  APR Â  t  02:39, 11 December 2007 (UTC)       [ edit ]   Ununoctium   I know this is a very short GA article, about an element that isn't much known about, but has anybody any idea why it should not be an FA? I believe it contains almost everything is known, or presumed, about this element, therefore it should pass the broadness criteria. Thanks,  Nergaal  ( talk ) 13:07, 10 December 2007 (UTC)     I think it may have a tough time getting featured because of the length, even if it covers the topic comprehensively, but that's just my impression from other FA discussions on obscure technical topics. But I suppose it's worth trying...        about the length: this is the shortest FA so far:  Hurricane Irene (2005) Nergaal  ( talk ) 15:13, 10 December 2007 (UTC)           My main comment is regarding the references. The article already cites most of the scientific literature on the topic, which is great, but there are also a lot of citations to websites that may not be as reliable (apsidium.com, webelements.com, and lenntech.com). Now, I don't know of any fact from these websites that is demonstrably wrong, but it would be better to quote a more ""solid"" source if possible. Y   Done  The problem may be that most of the information taken from these sites is of the ""seemingly obvious but speculative"" kind, such as the likely oxidation state and physical state that the element would have if it actually existed in macroscopic amounts. It is likely that the primary scientific literature will not provide such information because of a reluctance to speculate, but maybe there's a good article somewhere that could be used.   A specific fact that really needs a better source IMO is the claim that Moskowium (Mk) is one of the proposed names for the element. I haven't been able to find any source for it that doesn't seem to trace back to apsidium.com or Wikipedia. Also, proposed by whom? Perhaps this proposed name has only been discussed widely in the Russian-speaking world? The Russian version of this article seems to have some references for the name, but I really have no idea because I don't read Russian.Â :) I think it's the line that says "" ,  ,       "". Y   Done     I believe this link would be useful  [6]  if anyone could translate it. Nergaal  ( talk ) 15:19, 10 December 2007 (UTC)    I would like to clarify status of that site. This is a private site, it contains many doubtful statements, and I would not trust it unless the statements have independent sources. While working on the articles on superheavy elements in Russian wikipedia this summer I removed many suppositions based on the info from that site (an anonymous editor, probably the author of that site, has returned some links and info, and I don't have enough enthusiasm to argue with him). Nevertheless, I think that author of those materials has some contacts in JINR, so the info is often based on rumors circulated there. Y   Done   As to the name Moscowium, I don't know any info published in scientific journals (please let me know if you find some), but there were many publications in Russian press (like refs 9 and 10) based on info from Itkis and Oganessian, so I think it should be mentioned in the article.  Kv75  ( talk ) 09:34, 11 December 2007 (UTC)   If you find a couple of minutes, could you translate these references (9&10) into english? Just the title and the publisher. Thanks.

My understanding is that Wrestleview, Lords of Pain and Gerweck are considered unreliable. In addition, I don't know much about Wrestling-History, Body Slammin 4 Ever, Power Wrestling, Wrestling Attitude, Click 2 Houston, Wrestling DB or Steve's Wrestling. I suspect there may be some reliability issues with some of them, so I would recommend asking about them at  WPT:PW . Tripod sites are also generally frowned upon. Finally, Angelfire and 100megsfree4 are also usually considered unreliable, but the sites you've used on these servers are reliable. I'll change the names listed to the actual website names instead of the server names (eg. Wrestling Information Archive instead of 100 Megs Free).  GaryColemanFan  ( talk ) 15:07, 14 December 2007 (UTC)           A few of the references seem to be duplicates (eg. reference 36 is to Online World of Wrestling, a reliable site...reference 37 is to Wrestle View, a non-reliable site). In many of these cases, you could solve reliability problems by removing the extra reference. And since quite a few of the references seem to be to pay-per-view results, I thought I would recommend  http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/  . It's got results for every pay-per-view (but doesn't list the finishers used). Their results for this event are at  http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/nowayout.html#2004  . Hope this helps.  GaryColemanFan  ( talk ) 15:17, 14 December 2007 (UTC)           I went through the Background section and did a copyedit. I have a couple more things I wanted to being up:       The picture of the poster in the infobox has no Fair Use rationale. Y   Done   The final sentence in the lead paragraph is unsourced. Y   Done   I found this sentence very confusing: ""Heyman announced a triple-threat match at No Way Out for a WWE Championship match at WrestleMania XX between the Big Show, Kurt Angle, and John Cena on February 5, 2004."" Could it say, ""On February 5, 2004, Heyman announced that a triple-threat match would take place at No Way Out to determine who would face the WWE Champion at WrestleMania XX. The triple-threat match featured the Big Show, Kurt Angle, and John Cena."" or something along those lines? I think it would work much better as two sentences. Y   Done   Who is Jorge Paez? It would be nice to include a brief explanation of why he accompanied Rey Mysterio.

Thanks,   LPWRHR  ( talk ) 17:04, 8 December 2007 (UTC)     Some feedback:           Note  WP:LEAD  - for an article of this length, there should be a max of about 3 paragraphs.   WP:HEAD  suggests that headings should avoid having links; see if you can move the links to some part of the prose. Also, it looks like the text could use a couple more  links .   WP:MOSNUM  discusses the usage of conversions, eg. 1Â m (3 ft). I added  &nbsp;  already.   The footnotes need proper citing; there are now {{ Cite web }} templates, could you fill in the parameters? For example, title, author, date of access, etc.   Have the article fixed for spelling and grammar mistakes (suggest that you request that somebody else helps, since having a pair of fresh eyes is good). Couple of examples: (use cursor to hover over underlined)       Lombo Pocket Watch is a grey harness racing colt,  gaited a pacer he  was foaled 16 October 2003.   The second sentence is too long and should be split up, as its rather hard to follow the subject of the sentence.   1st of June 2007  -  WP:DATE  - avoid using 'st' 'th' for dates   As at   December 7 ,  before  his McInerney Ford Classic victory, Lombo Pocket Watch sat at 28th on the all-time stakes winners list,  and Australasia's  youngest millionaire pacer.       Also, there are a bunch of typos. In the fourth paragraph 'in' needs to be capitalized. Also spell-check,  contributer  (contributor), prestigous  (prestigious).

Thanks,   ISD  13:29, 4 December 2007 (UTC)     Some notes while I wait for the caffeine in my system to wear off:       In the reception section, the phrase ""Some like it because"" is weaselly and doesn't properly attribute the opinion. It's more appropriate to simply launch into who the reviewer is and what that particular reviewer specifically said.   ""However, since this review was made in 2004, more diverse characters have been included."" - Refuting an argument with a primary source is mildly OR. I'm not sure if this sentence really belongs.   Same section, ""Another review for The Offical Time Waster's Guide by a reviewer calling themselves ""EUOL"""" is both redundant and strikes me as slightly negative against the pseudonym. A quick check on the  About Us  link would have turned up the name Brandon Sanderson.   An instance of a quote not quite matching the subject of the sentence: 'Zampzon and Daku, discribed Kevin and Kell as, ""One of the few anthropomorphic strips that I actually like,""' <- Who is doing the saying here?   The ""places of note"" section/paragraph can probably be moved into the generic ""about"" section.   Not to be a  WP:FICT  snob, and not that it has to do with the article itself, but six sub-articles (one list plus five Dewclaws) is too much.   Snag a copyeditor, I found a couple minor mistakes in the prose (aside from the above).       It's a much better article than most of our webcomics offerings, but it's far from perfect. A lack of quality sources really hurts, but it's good to see an article work with what's out there.

Besides the middle paragraph, the about section is entirely in universe. What is needed is sales figures, readership, information on impact etc. (see  Wikipedia:Manual of Style (writing about fiction) ). If the problem is that there are no reliable sources about that, then the problem is trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. You can't create a FA if there aren't appropriate sources for a topic. Use all available out of universe information and shorten the in universe information until it is an appropriately small proportion of the article. -  Taxman   Talk  15:27, 6 December 2007 (UTC)     Have you looked at the  Megatokyo  article thoroughly to see what kinds of information and sources it uses?

Kim Dent-Brown   (Talk)  15:15, 7 December 2007 (UTC)         Please fix up the automated suggestions - I've had an article put on GA hold because of the automated suggestions. It's a bit unclear as to whether you've used the ""Academic studies"" section as a reference in the article at all. Is it just a case of further reading? Such a section is not compliant with the  WP:MOS , and as such would give GA reviewers pause. Why is  magick  (which, somehow, is a separate article from  magic (paranormal)  ) unmentioned? Why is  Craft name  capitalised as it is? The ""Discrimination against and persecution of Wiccans"" link does not work - and in any case screams out POV. I thought ""malevent"" was spelled ""malevolent""... you may need to run the article through a spell-checker. Also, you may wish to consider looking at GA or FA religion articles (not sure if there are any FA religion articles...) to see how they are structured and what information they cover.

Looking at  Bahai , one thing this article is missing is a ""demographics"" section - who practices Wicca? Is it recognised in any country's censuses? Is there any difference between the demographics of Wicca-in-a-tradition and eclectic Wicca? How impossible is it to find out the demographics of Wicca?

Thanks,  APR Â  t  19:44, 5 December 2007 (UTC)       Lots of good stuff here but I will only comment on what I perceive as the weaknesses:    It has an ambitious History section that gets (dare I say) 'too long'. Continue  summarizing , focusing on the sub-article  History of ancient Egypt  and less on the sub-sub-articles (listed in the ""Dynasties of Pharaohs in Ancient Egypt"" box - 'Dynasties'? the box looks like it is listing 'periods').    I'm working on it. Is the material up to and including the middle kingdom section succinct enough? (~JD)       There is an {{ expand }} tag in the Language section but its presence is not explained on the talk page or at  Wikipedia:Requests for expansion . Is the wrong tag being used?    I think the section probably needs to be re-organized into a 2 paragraph section with no subheadings, but should include a little more coverage, so I'll rewrite. (~JD)           On your specific questions: I cannot answer on quality of coverage. On the ""ancient achievements"" I would frame it less like ""achievements"" and more like ""technology of"".  Song Dynasty#Technology, science, and engineering  is an example. On the ""open problems"": maybe a  Historiography  section framed to illustrate what being academically debated. Don't have to include fringe theories. -- maclean  23:35, 5 December 2007 (UTC)    OK, thanks for the historiography link and suggestions. ""Technology, science, and engineering"" sounds like the right approach. I'll get to work!  Jeff Dahl  ( Talk    contribs ) 23:51, 5 December 2007 (UTC)       Referring to your questions, you don't need to include anything on fringe theories unless there is verifiable evidence that those theories are important in some way, in fact so important that they require coverage. But the legacy of Ancient Egypt would be a very important since it's one of the ancient civilization's that has a significant legacy and mindshare.    OK. In fact there is actually an article on  Egypt in the Western imagination ! I'll include some material about the ""Egyptomania"" craze in Europe, and the more direct legacy they had on greek and arab civilizations. (~JD)       Basically it's an issue of prioritizing - what can you justify as a major subtopic relating to Ancient Egypt and what not? I think ""Open problems and scientific inquiry"" should be condensed to ""Ongoing research"" or something and you would again need to prioritize what goes in that section by the most important ongoing research. Every section needs to include only the most important information on that subtopic.   A general category needed when discussing an ancient civilization would be the economics. You have a little on trade, but it needs to be more general to include what activities were most common, what information is available on the size of the economy, distribution of income, etc. Also demographics (slaves, free, foreign, etc) to the extent it is known.    Good suggestion about the economy, I can think of several important things about price and payment schedules and bartering that ought to be included. As for distribution of income, I'll add material that shows how the taxes were distributed, but nothing in terms of the percentiles that sociologists like to obsess over. As for demographics, I resist adding its own section because the history section already mentions when large numbers of foreigners/slaves came into the country; again doing percentiles is not the right approach due to the long span of time and vast changes involved, even though there is actually a decent amount of data available. I'll add demographic material about the total population size (which maxed out at 3 to 4 million in the new kingdom) and maybe some other general stuff but I want to keep it to a ""broad-brush"" approach. (~JD)       You've got your work cut out for you on researching to prioritize and justify what is important, but congratulations on working on such an important article. -  Taxman   Talk  15:41, 6 December 2007 (UTC)     Thanks for the review, your perspective helps, especially with the socio-economic sections.

I believe that it meets the barest minimums for Featured Article status, but needs some polishing, primarily in the area of formatting references to meet FA standards (using the long cite versions rather than simple inline ref tags). There is little more information that could be added to better the article, but it stays away from extraneous or trivial information for the most part. Could this be a potential Featured Article?

I'm not sure what all the best subsections are to make sure it's comprehensive, try surveying the best other animal related FA's and see what major sections they use.

Instead, replace the ""captivity"" section with a paragraph or two about issues concerning cabybaras in zoos, and link to a separate  List of captive capybaras  or something similar. Also, the gallery is long, distracting, and not necessary. Simply make sure all images are on The Commons and link to it prominently; having a gallery is unneeded. There also needs to a section (or sections) on capybara biology and physiology.

Sandy Georgia  ( Talk ) 00:24, 17 December 2007 (UTC)     [ edit ]   From  User:JayHenry   Hi VigilancePrime, I think you're off to a really good start. I've done some work on some animal articles, and here's an outline that I think might work really well for Capybara:     Lead section & infobox (of course)   1 Taxonomy and naming -- to discuss how scientists classify the animal and what names are used.    1.1 Evolution -- it's nice to know how the species evolved (but hard to research)   1.2 Looks like most scientists think there are two species of capybara, so you'll want a section discussing that.       2 Description   3 Behavior -- you've already got a start to this section.    3.1 Diet   3.2 Reproduction   3.3 Social life (if there's enough info)       4 Habitat   5 Conservation    5.1 In captivity         That's just a general outline that might work well for this article. And the good news is that you've already got a start to all of those sections! That's just a rough outline, and if you see sections in articles about other animals that might work, you can definitely add them.   I think the biggest challenge will be finding good sources. Right now most of the sources are zoo web sites. Zoo web sites are usually fairly reliable because zookeepers now a lot about the animals in their collection, but the information usually isn't very  detailed . In order to get that in depth, really comprehensive information for a  Featured Article , you'll want to learn about scientists and conservationists who study capybara and see what the newest information is. Once you start finding some of this research, you'll start finding more details to add to the article. Good luck with it and if you ever need any help, let me know! -- JayHenry  ( talk ) 07:07, 19 December 2007 (UTC)     [ edit ]   Aryl hydrocarbon receptor   I've listed this article for peer review because I have extensively worked on the scientific aspect of the article but would appreciate a grammar review.    Thanks,   Demantos  19:31, 3 December 2007 (UTC)     [ edit ]   Review by Jeff   A good start: the facts are here and the refs are very thorough. Rewriting (not just punctuation and spelling) will improve the article significantly.     The article should  put information into context  better, so that the average reader can understand what is going on. For example:           ""Non-ligand bound Ahr is retained in the cytoplasm as an inactive protein complex consisting of a dimer of Hsp90 "" the phrase 'Non-ligand bound' is incomprehensible to the average reader, but if I write:   ""When no ligands of the receptor are present, Ahr is retained in the cytoplasm as an inactive protein complex...When a ligand enters the cell and binds to the receptor, this inactive protein complex dissociates, allowing importation of the receptor into the nucleus so that it can interact with the cell's DNA.""   This sentence can be the lead of the paragraph or section, after which you can discuss the details. The idea is to  tell the big story first  so we can understand it in context, and only then can you explain the details.           This receptor is responsible for activating the body's response to xenobiotics, right?  So this should be explained clearly in the lead.   The opening sentence is: ""The Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a member of the family of basic-helix-loop-helix transcription factors."" Is this really the most important thing about this protein, and does it help explain the essence of the receptor to a casual reader? Consider replacing with the suggestion above.   The lead should summarize all important aspects of the receptor, such as who discovered it and when, what the receptor's purpose is, and why scientists are still researching it.   There is a problem with licensing of  Image:AhR.jpg . This has a half-written fair use rationale, but a free version can be made! We can't have fair-use material if free versions can be made. In fact, I will volunteer to make a free version of this, but I'm going to tag the existing version as a copyvio. (""reprinted with permission"" where is the documentation? What is the permission given, and who gave it? if permission really has been given, should have an OTRS ticket). As for  Image:AhRSignaling colour.png , I'm not entirely happy since it is almost an exact re-drawing of the original and a free version could easily be made. I'm not quite sure what to do with that one, so I'll leave it alone for now.   Are there any crystal structures available? How about any structures or models of any of the binding domains? I can access Sybyl and Chem3D for rendering structures if coordinates or other structure information is available.   Abbreviations: I recommend not using abbreviations unless you really need them, so if you only use a term once or twice, why bother abbreviating? Abbreviations are very hard to read, and make the article look like an alphabet soup. On the other hand, there are things than should not be spelled out, such as CYP1A1, Hsp90, XAP2. Just say: ""...the metabolic enzyme CYP1A1..."" (no need to say ""cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily A, polypeptide 1"" or spell them all out). The choice of what words to spell out should be made carefully.   Abbreviations: Even more annoying than an unnecessary abbreviation is re-defining the abbreviation over and over: ""...aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator(ARNT)..."" and later ""...AhR Nuclear Transporter (ARNT)..."" (note inconsistency) Why say it more than once? Clunky abbreviations are a pet peeve of mine in journal articles, so I'm sorry if this sounds terse. For ARNT I would suggest saying: ""...AhR's dimerization partner, a nuclear transporter called ARNT."" Also use consistent CAPS on AhR or Ahr.   ""...the end result is a variety of differential changes in gene expression."" add perhaps 2 sentences summarizing what these changes are.   Avoid sentences like ""reviewed by [8][9] ."" and ""as shown in [52][53][54][46] ."" (don't use a footnote as the object of a sentence!) and the period should come  before  the refs.   I hope I don't sound too harsh; I don't mean it to be. The article needs some rewriting so that non-experts can read it, but the content and refs are good. I would suggest one more image, if possible, would be a structure or model of the receptor, or at least one of the subdomains. And perhaps a structure of a typical aryl hydrocarbon with a caption like ""Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins such as TCDD activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, activating the xenobiotic response element"" I'm happy to answer more questions, take another look, and help out if I have time.

It's a detailed topic, so the whole article doesn't need to be accessible, but the lead section should be maximally so. The first sentence ""Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a member of the family of basic-helix-loop-helix transcription factors."" tells me absolutely nothing about the topic, and I have a fair amount of science background. The next sentence and the rest of the lead don't provide much more; it's not until the very last two words that I can tell what the topic is related to. Luckily the article is short, so there is a fair amount of room to add context here and there. Particularly in the lead you should minimize the use of overly complicated terms where possible, and define them in context when not. For example I can read the  Transcription factor  article to find out in general what AhR is, but in general the reader shouldn't  have to . Also the lead section should be 2 or 3 paragraphs, see  WP:LEAD . 2) In all that research, which is impressive by the way, would you say there are no other important bits of material you have left out? Without references and markup it's pretty short for a featured article candidate. -  Taxman   Talk  19:29, 6 December 2007 (UTC)       [ edit ]   SummerSlam (2007)   I've listed this article for peer review because It is currently B-Class, and I at least want it to reach  GA  status.

Thanks,   Star dust 8212  16:25, 1 December 2007 (UTC)     Thank you to  Stardust8212 Â ( talk Â     contribs ) for starting this Peer Review! (We worked together to get the article to  WP:GA  status.) I think the article is close to featured status actually, it covers a wide range of topics and is well-sourced. I am just curious if there is anything more that can be added from the DVD commentary that is not already in the article? I have not listened to the DVD commentary myself so I don't know what's discussed on there.  Cirt  16:29, 1 December 2007 (UTC).           I took notes on the commentary for interesting things they mentioned, most of them are already represented in the article but I'll post them on the talk page if you'd like to see them. They're my personal confusing shorthand style though so they may not be useful.  Star dust 8212  16:50, 1 December 2007 (UTC)           Sounds good, just so that we can draw as much information/background as possible out of the DVD commentary. Thanks again for starting this peer review and suggesting the move to FA status, there is a good amount of analysis presented, and I think it can be a good FA candidate soon.  Cirt  16:59, 1 December 2007 (UTC).             We discussed this in other places, but I decided to get it to the peer review,and amplify a bit. So my references make sense, I am discussing  this version .   The article, and its sourcing, are weak. References 1, 3, 4, and 8 are from DVD commentary. This is a compensated source, so it doesn't meet WP:RS. Even if they did, the statements supported are that the audio was recorded late, the Beastie Boys didn't perform a song, and that the producers liked the writers. Not very important statements, and certainly not establishing any importance for the topic.   Reference 2 is essentially a plot summary. Nothing about impact, nothing about how the world changed in any way as a result of this episodes existence. The closest it comes to having anything from the outside is Billy West refusing to name who the episode satirizes.   Reference 5 is used to explain plot points. The headings may say ""theme"" and ""cultural references"", but they are really part of the plot summary.   Reference 6 and 7 actually references things that ties it into the larger world.   Reference 8 and 9 support statements about a Simpsons episode, and it's questionable whether it belongs in the article at all.   Reference 10 supports the concept that the producer liked the episode. Not a particularly important statement ... very rarely will a producer come out and say he disliked it. Again, the producer is not a reliable source ... the inclusion of this episode was undoubtedly a balancing act of any number of marketing pressures. Whatever his actual opinion of an episode is, if the DVD is labeled ""Matt Groening's favorite episodes"", he isn't going to contradict it publicly.   References 11, 12, 13 and 14 are used solely to support that fact that the episode came out on DVD.   References 15 and 16 are reviewers statements, and are legitimate.   So, in summary, the article has very little well-referenced material supporting its statements, the statements that are supported are trivia, and the article fails to even demonstrate that the subject is of sufficient importance to warrant an article.   Not only would I not promote this to FA, I wouldn't rate it a GA. If it came to AFD, I'd vote ""delete.""

Give me some time and I'll respond to each of your points, here below.  Cirt  ( talk ) 22:35, 4 December 2007 (UTC).       Thanks for moving this here, I think this is the appropriate place to discuss these issues and I knew Cirt would be interested in seeing this as well. I wanted to get my thoughts in order before responding but failing in that I'm going to try not to ramble.           DVD commentary as a source: While I agree that DVD commentary should not be used to verify anything contentious I don't see a problem with any of the claims that are cited to these sources.  WP:EPISODE  specifically notes that production information should be included in the article. A brief look through the current FAs of TV episodes shows that many such articles rely on either DVD commentaries or other DVD featurettes for this type of information. Is this good practice? It could be argued either way but that seems like an issue for a wiser venue. My personal view is to regard DVD footage in the same vein as  self published sources  which are acceptable if the person is established as an expert on the subject matter. I can see no greater expert on the subject of making a TV show than the people who actually made it.   I agree that reference 2 doesn't add much to the article but it does back up many pf the statements from the DVD commentary and demonstrates that the episode received more than the usual press coverage.   I disagree with your portrayal of the themes section as a restatement of the plot. I think there is an important line between a statement of the plot and an analysis of the plot. The themes section discusses the plot and how it portrays religion in modern culture. A section describing the themes of a work of fiction is also common practice on Wikipedia (See  WP:NOVELS ) so I don't see a problem with including it. If we're going to include it then it should be sourced, which it is and I don't see a problem with the reliability of the book itself.   The inclusion of a cultural references section is a contentious point among editors and I won't try to claim that it's strictly necessary from an encyclopedic point of view however once again it seems to be common practice to include such a section when the items in it can be sourced, as these are.   ""Reference 6 and 7 actually references things that ties it into the larger world."" - Honestly I'm not clear on what the complaint is here.   References 8 & 9 were added by Cirt I believe to verify some notes connecting this to the rest of Groenings body of work, showing that it's part of a larger topic. Do they belong in the article? I could go either way on that and perhaps Cirt will address it.   Reference 10 - I disagree with the general statement that the producer is not a reliable source, as addressed above, however I understand where you're coming from with this particular sentance. Perhaps it would be more appropriate wording to say the DVD was marketed as one of Groening's four favorite episodes.   References 11, 12, 13 - Yes, we could probably just use one of those rather than all three to source that statement. My theory when working on the article however was to include all relevant sources so that people working on it in the future would be able to find the same articles and see if there was anything else useful in them. There's probably not but that was my thought process.   Reference 14 does not back up that the DVD was released, it is a third party stating this is one of the best episodes and is thus relevant to the reception section. There's no weblink so I cant't view it myself at the moment but it shouldn't be lumped in with the other three.   15 and 16 - At least we agree on something.Â :-)       I'm sorry you feel that the article is generally not encyclopedic but obviously I am prone to disagree. I think a lot of the items you take issue with are not things that only address this article and so I am not really sure how to address them but I have tried to answer them to the best of my ability.  Star dust 8212  15:56, 6 December 2007 (UTC)    I wasn't complaining about 6 and 7 ... they are the only two references that I think were both appropriate and appropriately used. You are right in the larger sense ... any episode article I review will come back with a review like this at best, and frequently much worse. Please don't take personal offense at my review. As episode articles go, this is clearly one of the better ones. Most episode articles would fare much worse, but the comments I made do illustrate why I don't think episode articles should be in Wikipedia at all. If the same class of references were used in a science article, the author would be flamed for weeks.

Perhaps someday the question of whether episode articles are ever notable will be discussed in full and we will be on opposite sides of the line but for now I'll just keep making what we have the best that it can be.. As for science articles...""Physicist A thinks this is the best theory he ever came up with""... that makes me giggle.

Thanks,  APR Â  t  19:44, 5 December 2007 (UTC)       [ edit ]   Comments from  MeegsC  |  Talk     The first sentence, which says the show is a  ""BBC television drama produced by the BBC ...for BBC One"" , is unnessarily redundant. I'd lose at least first instance of ""BBC"" (you can always pipe link ""television drama"" to  BBC television drama  if that's necessary); the third reference could be moved to another sentence.   The second sentence in the lead is very choppy, with lots of short clauses and two parenthetical statements. It needs to be simplified, either by reordering the clauses, or by breaking them into two sentencessomething along the lines of  ""Created by  G.F. Newman , it follows the exploits of a High Court judgeSir John Deed, played by Martin Shawas he tries to seek justice in the cases brought before him.""  You later mention the fact that Newman is well-known as the creator of  Law and Order , but you probably don't need to do so in the lead; it's not really relevant to  this  article.   There are multiple wikilinks to the same articles; per  WP:MOS , only the first instance should be wikilinked. Examples include  Martin Shaw  (three times in the first three paragraphs),  High Court  (twice in the first three paragraphs),  G.F. Newman ,  Law and Order  and many others.   Commas are missing in lots of places. Some examples:           ""As of 2007 there have been 29 episodes...""   ""In later years the series has shifted to a serialised format...""   ""Ratings for the series peaked with its first episode at 9.1 million[33] but it still ...""   ""the BBC had announced an intention to use Martin Shaw in a range of new projects and it was apparent...""           The sentence  ""The series remains on a break until the style is changed and due to Martin Shaw's involvement in a new series.""  is not well-written grammatically.   All single dashes need to be converted to em-dashes, per  WP:MOS .   ""Deed has been accused of hypocrisy...""  Is it the  character  or the  show  that's been accused? It's unclear from the article.     Glad to hear you've approached the LoCE; that will probably clean up a lot of these issues. I'll try to add more comment about the  content  of the article (as opposed to the writing) if I get some time over the holidays. Good luck with your drive toward improving the article!

Thanks,  APR Â  t  04:44, 1 December 2007 (UTC)     [From MeegsC]: I'll start by saying this is my first bridge article review, so if any of the following doesn't seem appropriate, feel free to ignore it!         There are a couple of problems with the lead. First, it's recommended that you don't include anything there that you don't also include in the article. That's a bit tough with one this short, but you might want to move very specific details, like the bridge dimensions, down into the article itself. That said, the lead is currently a bit short. Generally, you want to include salient facts from each section of the article, so you'll probably want to briefly mention something about it becoming a ""suicide bridge"". Not sure if you need to mention the accident, but you might give it a sentence in the same lead paragraph.   Is there any information about why the bridge was named for Washington?   A re there any details as to what, in particular, justified its listing on the National Register of Historic Places?           I've put in a request to  NRIS  for their file on this property, including its nomination. Once I have that, I'll scan it, put it online and cite the material. They said it would take them 2-3 weeks.  Cumulus Clouds  ( talk ) 22:58, 17 December 2007 (UTC)   Y   Done           Are any stats available re: amount of traffic per year, whether that's increasing or decreasing, etc. How many was it projected to carry? Is the real total higher or lower? Stuff like that.           Yes! I found the WSDOT's Annual Traffic Report, and it includes traffic statistics for locations along SR 99. (For my information: 2006-125).  Cumulus Clouds  ( talk ) 23:53, 17 December 2007 (UTC)           The article says the design ""was awarded to"" a local architecture firm. Did they design it? If so, this statement is confusing and should be reworded.  -  Y   Done   Were the builders local? Any trouble with schedules, deaths during construction, etc.? (Just trying to think of ways you might expand the article a little, if appropriate...)   You should replace the double dashes ""--"" with em-dashes """" to meet  WP:MOS  standards.   Y   Done         Good luck getting it to GA!  MeegsC  |  Talk  00:09, 14 December 2007 (UTC)         Those are good recommendations and I will be sure to revise accordingly! Thank you!

Thanks,  APR Â  t  04:45, 1 December 2007 (UTC)       [ edit ]   Quadell's  observations   This is great, and I'd love for this to get featured. It still needs a lot of refactoring, however. I went through and made a lot of minor changes  here . I suspect those are uncontroversial, but if you disagree or don't understand any of these changes, we can discuss them. The larger changes needed I'll list here:     The  lead  is supposed to be a summary of the entire article. The first 2 paragraphs are fairly good at that (although the list of his jobs is never really mentioned in the article), but that third lead paragraph is problematic. It goes into detail about his disease, adding undue weight in the lead, and covering a lot of info not covered in the article. Instead, I would recommend the following for the 3rd paragraph of the lead:    Remove the second sentence, and mention it somewhere in the article instead.   Take out everything between the third sentence and the last sentence, refactoring it into ""Folk revival and Guthrie's death"" or other sections.   Consider combining the 2nd and 3rd paragraphs, or else adding more material which summarizes the sections of the article.    Somewhat addressed. -- Dannygutters Â ( talk Â     contribs ) 15:58, 17 December 2007 (UTC)   IMO, the lead is fine now.   Quadell   ( talk ) ( random )  19:50, 17 December 2007 (UTC)           I have a few citation concerns.    There is some speculation in the article that Guthrie's mother may have started the fires that killed her daughter and maimed her husband. This is quite dramatic, and could be disputed, so it needs a cite.    Cited -- Dannygutters Â ( talk Â     contribs ) 14:38, 31 December 2007 (UTC)       The article states ""A fiddle or a banjo could be found in most homes in Okemah and some family members could usually play one or two songs."" That's unsourced, and it's also confusing and out of place. I would personally remove the sentence entirely.    Removed -- Dannygutters Â ( talk Â     contribs ) 15:58, 17 December 2007 (UTC)       It says ""With the outbreak of war in 1939 KFVD radio did not want Communists and sympathizers on its staff"". That needs a cite.    (notes to myself) This is in the Ed Cray Book. -- Dannygutters Â ( talk Â     contribs ) 04:15, 17 December 2007 (UTC)    Addressed-- Dannygutters Â ( talk Â     contribs ) 15:37, 21 December 2007 (UTC)           In ""Folk revival and Guthrie's death"", it states ""seeing their friend's uncontrolled movements and hearing his slurred speech made it difficult to maintain their composure"". Again, this could make them look bad, so it needs a cite.    (notes to myself) This is in the Kline book, look up -- Dannygutters Â ( talk Â     contribs ) 04:15, 17 December 2007 (UTC)   Removed -- Dannygutters Â ( talk Â     contribs ) 14:38, 31 December 2007 (UTC)       Also, ""Ramblin Man"" and ""Woody Guthrie: A Life"" should only be spelled out in the first reference that mentions the book. After that,  the references should either say "" ibid , p. Whatever"",  or the abbreviated title and page number only. (I just read that ""ibid"" is discouraged on Wikipedia. See  Wikipedia:Footnotes#Style recommendations  how to do this correctly.)    I'm confused on this, If I use a named refrence for the first occurance of the book how do I note page numbers when using that same refrence later in the article?-- Dannygutters Â ( talk Â     contribs ) 15:15, 18 December 2007 (UTC)    I mean as ccoil described below, or as  El Greco  does it. The ""References"" section could spell out all the details (e.g. "" Cray, Ed  (2004).  Ramblin Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie .  W. W. Norton & Company .  ISBN 0393327361 . Â  ""), but the ""Citations"" section could give a minimal listing, with page numbers (e.g. ""Cray,  Ramblin Man , pp. 30""). Citations would be inside <ref> tags.   Quadell   ( talk ) ( random )  16:11, 18 December 2007 (UTC)    Ok, I addressed these 2 book items -- Dannygutters Â ( talk Â     contribs ) 19:27, 18 December 2007 (UTC)                   In the ""Early life"" section, it's a little confusing about how old Guthrie was when certain things were happening. When Guthrie was on his own and learning to play harmonica, was he 7 or 17? You say he didn't complete high school, but then later, after he moved to Texas, you say ""Guthrie was still reluctant to attend class"". What class? Was he back in high school?   In that same section, you mention a blues player, but don't give his name. He is later referred to as ""the shoe shine man"", which seems a little unprofessional. If his name is not known, the article should say that.    (notes) These passages can be found in the Cray Book. -- Dannygutters Â ( talk Â     contribs ) 04:17, 17 December 2007 (UTC)    Addressed -- Dannygutters Â ( talk Â     contribs ) 15:37, 21 December 2007 (UTC)           The music sample is of someone covering a Guthrie song, but the ogg box doesn't indicate that -- I expected to hear Guthrie's voice and was quite surprised. It's nice that we have a free version of the song, but it seems a bit irrelevant, like including a free image of someone dressed up like Woodie Guthrie. Instead, it should have an ogg of a sample of Woodie's singing and playing.    Ha HA, I guess I haven't actually listened to this, I have updated it with an actual sample of the song as per Fair use. -- Dannygutters Â ( talk Â     contribs ) 06:25, 17 December 2007 (UTC)       The last sentence in the ""Pacific Northwest"" section makes it sound like the Catholic Church granted him a divorce. I'm not sure how you want to reword it.    Addressed -- Dannygutters Â ( talk Â     contribs ) 16:23, 17 December 2007 (UTC)       ""Further Reading/Listening"" is awkward. With the PBS link, should it be ""Further Reading/Watching/Listening""?Â ;-) No, it should be ""Further information"" or something similar. Also, there's no need to have ""Retrieved on"", since they're not references.    Addressed -- Dannygutters Â ( talk Â     contribs ) 16:23, 17 December 2007 (UTC)       It's redundant to have {{ sisterlinks }} and the individual links to sister projects. Which do you prefer?    Addressed -- Dannygutters Â ( talk Â     contribs ) 16:23, 17 December 2007 (UTC)       Why does the ""Selected Discography"" list albums by latest publishing date, rather than original publishing date or original recording date?    This is because the recording catalogue was one song at a time rather than with a planned album format. Most all Guthrie releses are cobbled together from a variaty of recording sessions. This ends up being many different releases of the same 40 tracks on diffrent mediums (78s,LPs,Cassette,CD, etc), so this seems to be the most logical way to list them. Tho I will reword the into paragraph to point out that the dates are the original publishing date of these particular releases. This is the catalogue as it is avaliable today. I have created the linked discography page if anyone is interested in the recording dates of particular tracks. Does this make sense or should I try to do it another way. -- Dannygutters Â ( talk Â     contribs ) 16:23, 17 December 2007 (UTC)    I think that's fine then. I was just wondering what made the most sense.   Quadell   ( talk ) ( random )  19:50, 17 December 2007 (UTC)           There are some serious wording problems in the ""Almanac Singers"" section. What does this mean? ""Pete Seeger handled the bookings around New York and booked so many shows that when one could not book the Almanac Singers and expect to have Seeger, Guthrie, Lampell and Hays."" I'm guessing that means you couldn't expect to see the four most famous singers because the group was double-booked, but I'm not sure. What does ""the group would be get a set"" mean? When you say ""The house too was founded on their common socialist ideals"", what is the ""too"" signifying? Was something else founded on their ideals? Did they found the house, or just come upon it?    I made a stab at updating this. May need more work tho.-- Dannygutters Â ( talk Â     contribs ) 16:23, 17 December 2007 (UTC)       Since the article is about Woody Guthrie the person, I think the last two sentences of the ""Bound for Glory"" section should be combined into ""A film adaptation, released in 1976, won two Academy Awards."" If more should be mentioned, then it should be mentioned elsewhere -- in a ""legacy"" section, or on a separate article on ""Bound for Glory"".    Addressed, removed excess info about the movie -- Dannygutters Â ( talk Â     contribs ) 16:23, 17 December 2007 (UTC)       In the last paragraph of the ""Mermaid Avenue"" section, it says ""Elliott studied extensively with Guthrie"", but is ""with"" correct? Was Guthrie studying anything (and if so, what?), or what Elliott just studying Guthrie?    Updated to 'under' -- Dannygutters Â ( talk Â     contribs ) 16:23, 17 December 2007 (UTC)       And finally, my biggest problem with the article: in parts it reads like a list of people who want to be associated with Guthrie. The article should include material on Guthrie, but not a ""Best Cinematographer"" win for a film adaptation of his book; not every barely-notable musician who ever covered one of his tunes or wrote a song about him; and not the fact that a water tower has ""Home of Woody Guthrie"" painted on it. Way too much trivia. One particularly galling example is the highlighting of Jefferson Pepper (who?) in his own sentence as having covered ""This Land Is Your Land"", complete with album name and year, before listing the 26 other presumably-less-notable performers (such as Bruce Springstein and Bing Crosby) that also covered the song. It's obvious someone wanted to promote Pepper. Since  This Land is Your Land  has its own article, it's enough to say in this article that the song has been covered by many artists, and maybe name the two or three most famous. For the same reason, everything from ""Musical Legacy"" on is a mess. See how  Woody Guthrie Folk Festival  is its own article, with just a link and a summary in this article, and no tedious lists of performers cluttering it up? Do the same with  The Woody Guthrie Foundation , mentioning ""Mermaid Avenue"" I and II in  Woody Guthrie , but leaving out every other half-notable adaptation. In fact, I'd be inclined to make a  Musical legacy of Woodie Guthrie  article, taking lots out of this one. Any way you do it, the listy sections ""Tributes"" and ""Songs about Woody"" should really go, as should the list of topics discussed in Guthrie songs.    This is a result of several add ons, I didn't know if I should remove (for example) the pepper refrence just because I didn't know who he was, I'll attempt to clarify these. -- Dannygutters Â ( talk Â     contribs ) 16:23, 17 December 2007 (UTC)   Moved the Songs about woody information to the individual artists pages that mention it, should we leave the tributes section as it doesn't really have anywhere else to go? Otherwise I guess we could remove it entirely, maybe leaving info on the Leventhal concert (post death). As for the Topics of Woody Guthrie songs, do you think this would be a good thing to make into a category? -- Dannygutters Â ( talk Â     contribs ) 16:52, 17 December 2007 (UTC)               I'm happy to see the ""songs about woody"" section go, but think the Tributes section is relevant and, since it's not as list-y, should stay.  Kmzundel  ( talk ) 14:47, 18 December 2007 (UTC)                   I think Topics of Woody Guthrie songs is inherently trivial and subjective. I don't think it should be kept at all. But I like what you've done with the entire post-death part of the article.   Quadell   ( talk ) ( random )  19:50, 17 December 2007 (UTC)                       Absolutely agree!

Perhaps that there is so much on career and little else. The section on music and voice is a good idea, but it should probably be broader and a greater proportion of the article. It should include more description of here vocal quality, acting ability, etc, such as the best reviews that cover those. Try checking the other FA's on musicians, find the best ones, and see if you can distill an improved layout from them. -  Taxman   Talk  19:43, 6 December 2007 (UTC)    I'd love to add more to these sections, but I'm limited by what's out there as far as sources.

If you would find such a review helpful, please click  here . Thanks,  APR Â  t  02:46, 29 November 2007 (UTC)       [ edit ]   Review by Jeff   This is a pretty good start, but I have bone to pick: the term  selective catalytic reduction  certainly covers more than just reduction of NO x . Imagine if the article on  reduction  only talked about catalytic converters. In fact, the catalytic converter is itself an example of selective catalytic reduction. Consider changing the title to 'Selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides' or something along those lines. Many things can be catalytically reduced in a selective way; industry buzzwords don't always make good article titles; you might have to think hard about which title to go with.   Sources: You need a lot more. I see only 4 or so unique sources, you probably need about 15 at least, including scholarly publications, books, and other print sources, not just websites. Your sources should be properly cited as well, including page numbers, year of issue, access date, etc. Suggest using the {{ cite book }} and {{ cite web }} templates. Other sources to add might be mentions in the press, such as newspapers and articles.   Consider adding information about the history of the development of the technology. If the article is only going to talk about SCR of nitrogen oxides, then add information about how many plants are in operation, worldwide distribution of the technology, and any other things you can think of to make the coverage more thorough.   One good thing I see is that the article is fairly balanced. Often, industrial technology articles with environmental applications are written entirely from the perspective of the environmentalist, with much less emphasis on the actual technology. Still, I do get the sense that the article was written in a power plant, or at least from that perspective, because much of the article relates to the technology as it applies to plant applications. Try to keep the article balanced, with a wide perspective not limited to just one application of the technology.   As for images, I would only be looking for one more: a picture of a unit in operation, or perhaps a picture of some element of the unit. A good start, plenty to work on.

The first sentence is a bit bland (perhaps just say it was the only subtropical cyclone of the season). Also, since the total number of characters in prose in the article is less than 6,000, having just one lede paragraph would suffice.   Y   done  - The article varies between saying that two and three people were killed by the storm; please fix and clarify.   The writing needs to be better.  formation by forming  (redundant),  the Yucatn  (Peninsula or Mexican state?),  Conditions in the Gulf of Mexico were favorable for tropical storm formation, however westerly wind shear forced the system to not strengthen.  - This seems to contradict itself. Wind shear would imply that conditions were not that favorable, and furthermore,  forced  is a poor word choice, since it is more of a human action.  A subtropical depression formed  - a location would be good.  After crossing the Outer Banks of North Carolina on June 19  - whoa, we just went from gaining SS status over Florida to it jumping to be over NC. Saying that it tracked northeastward, and giving an explanation of why it did so, would be useful.  Even though the pressures remained low, the storm expanded and became distorted  - this sentence is unclear and vague.  minimal  - minimal or minimum central pressure? Y   done  (Control of tropical cylcones was given to the Canadian Hurricane Centre in 1985.)  - Is this important to this article? Y   done  In the preps section -  including a tornado  - there is no parallelism between the words, so either it should be ""tornado, severe thunderstorm, and special marine warnings"" or clarify what type of warning occurred for each event. Y   done  Three people were killed in Florida in association with the subtropical storm with thirteen injuries  - this implies that three people died from injuries; clarification is needed.   The storm history needs to be organized, and it should go in order of events; thus, the earliest event (the Caribbean disturbance - the article does not specify where it came from nor when it developed) should be listed at the beginning of the section. The first paragraph does not say what the three systems were. Try and organize the second paragraph better to avoid having so many short sentences together.   Y   done  - Metric units and consistency between units are needed. When the original unit is rounded (inches, for example), the converted unit should be as well; 4 to 6 inches should be read as 46Â inches (100150Â mm).   Y   done  - More wikilinking would be useful (Recon, LPA, a link to Florida would be much more useful than linking peninsula).  on the morning of June 18  - Due to user preferences, the date needs to be Wikilinked, or, to avoid redundancy, avoid mentioning the date and say the storm made landfall later that day.   Y   done  - The two paragraphs in the Florida section could be better organized. It appears there are a lot of words, but not a terribly great amount of information. Perhaps merge the paragraphs and rewrite it as one (or, since they are slightly separate meteorologically, rewrite all but the tornado info as one paragraph, then split the tornado).   Y   done  - Small formatting issues need to be better, particularly with non-breaking spaces   N   not done  - I'd like to see some more sources, particularly newspaper sources.

Thank you,   Burningclean Â  [ Speak the truth! ]  03:43, 27 December 2007 (UTC)     [ edit ]   LuciferMorgan   Comments  There's some POV within the article, and other issues;     ""The title track had moderate success on metal-oriented radio, preparing the way for the release later that year of the group's first studio album, Facelift, which debuted at #42 on the Billboard 200 charts.[3]"" - ""Moderate success""? According to whom? Whether something is deemed successful or not is an opinion. For example, others may have deemed it a minor success, or a major success, and not a ""moderate success"". By stating the ""title track had moderate success"", you're casting judgment which means that is your own personal opinion. Such a personal observation means you're nominating yourself as a music critic, so this is therefore POV.  LuciferMorgan  ( talk ) 17:07, 27 December 2007 (UTC)   ""The song ""Man in the Box"" had success as a single and the music video recieved rotation on MTV."" - Yet more POV per the reasoning given above. Stick to the facts please. Instead of stating the song is a success, tell the reader what positions the single achieved (and which charts they achieved this / these on).  LuciferMorgan  ( talk ) 17:09, 27 December 2007 (UTC)   ""Both of these singles had success on the United States singles charts.[7]"" - Yet more POV.  LuciferMorgan  ( talk ) 17:09, 27 December 2007 (UTC)   ""Facelift was certified gold by the United States RIAA, with access sales of 500,000 copies by the end of the year."" - When an album is certified gold in the US, it means 500,000 copies have been shipped to stores. It doesn't mean the album sold that many. Therefore, the sentence is misleading.  LuciferMorgan  ( talk ) 17:11, 27 December 2007 (UTC)   ""The successful debut was supported by a tour opening for well known artists such as Van Halen, Poison, and Iggy Pop.[3]"" - ""Successful""? And yet more POV - whether the debut was ""successful"" is an opinion as I said. Stick to the facts. Also, how do you measure whether these artists Alice in Chains supported are ""well known""? Album sales? Chart positions? Television appearances? Whether they're ""well known"" is your own personal opinion. In some territories, they may not be well known. The words ""well known"" should therefore be removed.  LuciferMorgan  ( talk ) 17:14, 27 December 2007 (UTC)   ""The EP contained five acoustic songs (one being a hidden track), in order to keep the band in the public eye between the albums Facelift and Dirt.[8]"" - The reasons for Alice in Chains releasing the EP is a personal opinion, and in this case the opinion of  Rolling Stone . They may have released the EP as they thought the material was strong? They may have released it as new product to plug while on tour? See, so this is where personal opinions can mislead people. Such an opinion as  Rolling Stone' s needs attribution.  LuciferMorgan  ( talk ) 17:18, 27 December 2007 (UTC)   ""This is the band's highest selling album and considered by many fans and All Music Guide, Alice in Chains' best album.[3][14]"" - ""Considered by many fans""? According to whom? How did they come to such a conclusion? Did they do a survey? The fact many fans allegedly consider it to be their best work is merely a personal opinion of a critic, so therefore should be attributed as such. This is not factual, so shouldn't be presented as such.  LuciferMorgan  ( talk ) 17:22, 27 December 2007 (UTC)     Once the above examples have been sufficiently addressed, I'll take a second look at the article.  LuciferMorgan  ( talk ) 17:25, 27 December 2007 (UTC)     [ edit ]   M3tal H3ad     In 1986, Layne Staley's band Sleeze,  featuring bassist Jim Sheppard now of Nevermore , had just broken up - The stuff in italics is unnecessary and the sentence could be reworded to something like "" In 1986, Layne Staley's band Sleeze had disbanded and he wished to start a new one the following year.   He went to the 'Music Bank' practice studio  to watch musicians play , and met guitarist and song-writer Jerry Cantrell. - practice studio gives the impression they are playing instruments   and playing clubs in Seattle - playing at clubs   Their name - again is the band a singular or plural   In 1989 Columbia Records signed Alice in Chains - comma after the year   After recording a series - tell the reader how many ""series"" also sounds awkward   The title track reached number five metal-oriented radio - missing words in this sentence   preparing the way for the release later that year of the group's first - awkwardly worded ""preparing the way"" is not encyclopedia language   The band  also  appeared in the film   The album also featured a song titled ""Iron Gland"" with guest vocalist Tom Araya of Slayer. -> The album featured a guest appearance by Slayer vocalist Tom Araya on the track """"Iron Gland"" .   While  the band was  touring to promote Dirt, Starr left the group due to the band's nonstop schedule,   once again in 1993 - they already entered the studio in 1993 before this?   Still the problem with the images - saying its a girl in the sand won't be good enough for fair use, did it create controversy, is it significant, and the band's logo is still in the infobox, which was part of the objection on the FAC last time.  M3tal H3ad  ( talk ) 06:33, 28 December 2007 (UTC)       If the image is significant (like his last performance with the band) it, then yes it will probably qualify as fair use.  M3tal H3ad  ( talk ) 07:20, 28 December 2007 (UTC)       [ edit ]   Indopug   Long way from FA  The main problem right now are the sources you've used. Amazon.com (customer reviews?!), blogspot, rockdetector, rockonthenet, cduniverse, cd.ciao, discogs, loisville.edu, isound, metal archives, historylink, geocities ... Also, you dont need to reference stuff like Grammy nominees, track-listing, whether the song was in a soundtrack etc...  Indopug  ( talk ) 09:34, 28 December 2007 (UTC)     Firstly, Rockdetector is an excellent source. Secondly, of course that stuff needs to be referenced- it's  very  important that Grammy nominations are referenced, and soundtrack/tracklistings need to be referenced as much as any other fact... However, I completely agree with you about the non-reliability of many of the sources you listed.  J Milburn  ( talk ) 14:07, 28 December 2007 (UTC)    Rockdetector isn't an excellent source J Milburn, actually. Their biographies are riddled with edits, and are mocked in the metal community.

LuciferMorgan  ( talk ) 15:11, 28 December 2007 (UTC)    It has an article ( Rockdetector ) which at least suggests some  prominence /importance; that's not to say your misgivings about  quality  are valid or invalidÂ :) -- kingboyk  ( talk ) 16:48, 28 December 2007 (UTC)    I would say that it falls under our definition of a  reliable source , but, obviously, you've [LuciferMorgan] got a much better knowledge of the metal community than I have. I'll avoid it in future.  J Milburn  ( talk ) 22:10, 28 December 2007 (UTC)                   [ edit ]   J Milburn   Ok, I'm not going to go into the prose in detail in this initial review, it looks as if LuciferMorgan and M3tal H3ad have already had a good go at that.     I am not convinced about the fair use rationale on  Image:Laynemtv.JPG . I know copyright fuss is something that bothers a lot of people, but it is something that we need to pay attention to. Firstly, there needs to be completely seperate rationales for each article that it is used in, and secondly, the rationale needs to explain explicitly why it is not replaceable (not so difficult in this case) and why it adds a lot to the article. Non free images that aren't something obvious (screenshots, album covers, logos, that kind of thing) are often a lot more trouble than they are worth. Have you tried contacting someone and requesting a free image? Take a read of  this  and  this  if you fancy giving that a go- that is one way of getting a free image that often works, but not something that people try very often.   Ok, I'm going to go through sources which I think need removing, as they are unreliable, to go into a little more detail from Indopug's point above.    http://louisville.edu/~smmann01/bio.html  - This is a personal page created by a student at the University of Lousville- basically the same as a Geocities site.   http://www.metal-archives.com/release.php?id=4003  - This appears to be a deadlink, but I would very much avoid citing Metal-Archives if I were you. It isn't as user generated as some sites, but it is by no means a super-relianle source. However, as this seems to be a deadlink, I would find a new source.   http://www.amazon.com/Clerks-Motion-Picture-Various-Artists/dp/B000002AV1  - Citing the information given by Amazon staff (I know shops sometimes include small details- tracklistings, personnel) is alright, but the user reviews are  not  reliable.   http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=1262194  - Ditto above.   http://cd.ciao.co.uk/Dirt_Alice_In_Chains__Review_5350800  - Ditto above, and it would seem that, in this case, you are citing the unreliable review.   http://clubs.pathfinder.gr/AliceInChains_  I'm not exactly sure what this is, but it  definately  doesn't look reliable.   http://clubs.pathfinder.gr/AliceInChains_  - Again, not certain what it is, but it looks like a personal site masquerading as a reliable source.   http://www.still-in-chains.de.vu/  - Ditto above.   http://www.finitesite.com/layne/bio.htm  - And again. Sites like this are only reliable if they are written by someone who we can trust to be reliable- someone with a link to the band, for instance, but still I would be very careful to say 'according to X...'   Not an unreliable one, but there is a typo in this reference, currently at number 35- ""Well Worth The Trip. Roadruuner Records UK (2002-12-24). Retrieved on 2007-12-07.""   Ditto! ""Hay, Travis (2005-02-21). Alice in Chains owns stage in tsunami-relief show full of surprises. Seattlepi.com'. Retrieved on 2007-11-25.""   http://onediedsimply.blogspot.com/2006/11/staind-nutshell-cover-stripped.html  - Blogspot is a no-no. If the video on the site is a reliable source, cite it, but don't link. We do not link to copyright infringements. We probably have a template for citing TV shows.   http://www.geocities.com/sfloman/aliceinchains.html  - Geocities is another no-no, for obvious reasons.       I'd say that the other references are fine, apart from one or two to the same sites that I skipped because I didn't want to repeat myself. But, as that shows, the article really needs gutting of weak sources. Because of my two (rather serious) concerns above, this article isn't even worthy of its GA status, despite the fact it is so professionally formatted.   There is no need for the absolutely huge logo- it should be small, and at web resolution,  and  the rationale is a little weak.   In the discography section, 'Upcoming album' isn't the album's name, and so should not be italicised.   ""On 1992-03-21 Alice in Chains released"" I wouldn't format dates like that in the prose itself. Try ""On  March 21 ,  1992 ...""   ""During the band's reunion shows, they enlisted Comes With the Fall's William DuVall, who previously performed with Cantrell's solo band, to sing lead vocals. Velvet Revolver's Duff McKagan joined the band for the tour, playing rhythm guitar on a few songs.[38]"" Single sentence paragraphs don't look good, at all.     Although to the untrained eye this article may look excellent, the poor sourcing and image use drag it down. Clean that out, and it may rise again to featured status.  J Milburn  ( talk ) 14:42, 28 December 2007 (UTC)   Looking through the sources for a second time-     First of all, please correct me if I'm wrong, (I know I've made at least three mistakes tonight...) but I think, when formatting sources by multiple authors (say John Smith and Joe Bloggs) it should be formatted like this- ""Smith, John; Bloggs, Joe."" In other words- [Surname1], [Firstname1]; [Surname 2], [Firstname2]. You don't seem to do this all the time- look at citation 40 for example. ""D'Angelo; Vineyard; Wiederhorn, Joe; Jennifer; Jon (2002-04-22). MTV.com  ""'He Got Me To Start Singing': Artists Remember Layne Staley"". MTV.com. Retrieved on 2007-11-08.""   Consensus above seems to be that Rockdetector isn't a reliable source either- may be worth trying to find another citation for whatever you have cited to it.   Another typo! ""Singles - Souundtracks and music scores. Aliceinchains.com. Retrieved on 2007-12-28.""   http://aic.gsg2007.de/biography.html  - Looks like a personal site to me.   http://www.still-in-chains.de.vu/  - Another personal site.   ""Directed by Joe Perota. (1996). Unplugged - Alice in Chains [Television production]. MTV."" Seeing as we can't immediately access this, perhaps quotes which back up what you are citing would be appropriate, providing they aren't too long.     Sorry, but they still aren't all looking good. Well done on replacing some of the problem citations so quickly though. Logo is now much better, the other fair use image still needs work.

It was supposed to be for parallel construction: ""to move to London and to become a bookseller"". I have restored it, if that's ok.  Awadewit  |  talk  11:17, 2 December 2007 (UTC)           Scholars have speculated that Johnson was bound out to Keith because he was associated with local Liverpool Baptists.  Presumably the ""he"" refers to Keith, but maybe it needs to be clearer?           Grammatically ""he"" does refer to Keith, but perhaps this isn't enough? Have changed ""he"" to ""the bookseller"".  Awadewit  |  talk  11:17, 2 December 2007 (UTC)           The Ladies New and Polite Pocket Memorandum Book   is there no apostrophe after Ladies?           Correct. I think apostrophe usage in the eighteenth century was a bit spotty.Â :)  Awadewit  |  talk  11:17, 2 December 2007 (UTC)           The appearance of religious books is rather sudden; maybe say: ""religious texts began to dominate his book list""?           They didn't begin to - they did from the start. I have tried to make this clearer by making Johnson's connection to Dissent more clearly religious in the previous sentence.  Awadewit  |  talk  11:17, 2 December 2007 (UTC)           he also published works relating to Liverpool, his hometown, and medical texts.  For purposes of series continuity, maybe make the last item ""medicine""? (Unless he was publishing works about other works about medicine?)           Changed.  Awadewit  |  talk  11:17, 2 December 2007 (UTC)           The bit about the congers feels out of place; I expected the blockquote to relate to it somehow. Maybe put the congers sentence after the quote?           Excellent solution.  Awadewit  |  talk  11:17, 2 December 2007 (UTC)           Mmmm,  Henry Fuseli .           Have you read  A Series of Unfortunate Events ?  Awadewit  |  talk  11:17, 2 December 2007 (UTC)           No, but the description on that page sounds like the author ripped me off! Â  Scartol Â Â  Tok  14:57, 2 December 2007 (UTC)               Fuseli was Johnson's closest friend until his death.  Whose death?           Johnson's - again grammar might not be enough, but to repeat Johnson seems inelegant. Suggestions?  Awadewit  |  talk  11:26, 2 December 2007 (UTC)           No, I deliberately left it because I couldn't think of one. Let's see. How about ""Fuseli was his closest friend until Johnson's death.""? Â  Scartol Â Â  Tok  14:57, 2 December 2007 (UTC)           I don't think that really solves the problem, does it? Besides, now the grammar is wrong.Â :)  Awadewit  |  talk  17:34, 2 December 2007 (UTC)           Yes, I suppose it is. Sorry, I'm out of ideas. Â  Scartol Â Â  Tok  18:05, 2 December 2007 (UTC)           How about ""Johnson and Fuseli remained best friends until Johnson's death in 1809.""?  Willow  18:17, 2 December 2007 (UTC)           How about: Johnson and Fuseli were BFF.Â :) - Willow's is definitely the best version so far.  Awadewit  |  talk  18:21, 2 December 2007 (UTC)                       Priestley, in turn, trusted Johnson enough to handle the logistics of his induction into the Royal Society.  Whose induction?           Priestley's - this is supposed to be inductive.Â :) Why would it be worth stating that Priestley trusted Johnson to handle Johnson's own induction? Suggestions?  Awadewit  |  talk  11:26, 2 December 2007 (UTC)           Yeah, I know. Sometimes I slip away from logic and go into pure sentence-structure mode. I trust you to decide if it needs revision. Re-reading this sentence, I don't think it does. Â  Scartol Â Â  Tok  14:57, 2 December 2007 (UTC)               Newly independent, with an established reputation, Johnson did not struggle as he had before.  This is the first we hear (unless I'm mistaken) of previous struggles. Include a mention earlier?           It's just a general struggle. Sentence changed to:  Newly independent, with a reputation, Johnson did not need to struggle to establish himself as he had early in his career.   Awadewit  |  talk  11:26, 2 December 2007 (UTC)           Am I supposed to know what the Chapter Coffee House is/was? The quote makes me feel like I ought (and makes me want a cup of joe).           No, you aren't supposed to know. I don't know and the sources didn't say anything beyond this. I was hoping someday someone might add something there.Â :)  Awadewit  |  talk  11:26, 2 December 2007 (UTC)           I thought that might be it. Â  Scartol Â Â  Tok  14:57, 2 December 2007 (UTC)               While Johnson looked to his business interests, he did not necessarily publish only works that would enrich him.  I didn't want to remove ""necessarily"" in a unilateral fashion, but if I  owned  the article, I'd take it out.           Removed unnecessary ""necessarily"".  Awadewit  |  talk  11:26, 2 December 2007 (UTC)           he helped Priestley publish the Theological Repository, which was a financial failure, but which called on its contributors to submit  How about: ""Repository, a financial failure which called on""? (Again, I didn't feel safe making this change myself.)           Changed.  Awadewit  |  talk  11:26, 2 December 2007 (UTC)           I changed it because ""occasional travel narratives"" sounds to me like the narratives are occasional (each one produced periodically).           Sounds better.  Awadewit  |  talk         More to come after I shovel the walk!

Awadewit  |  talk  11:36, 2 December 2007 (UTC)           He continued his support in 1787, 1789, and 1790  The end of this sentence is a bit confusing (two possible subjects for the verb ""publishing"").           Now reads:  He continued his support in 1787, 1789, and 1790, when Dissenters introduced repeal bills in  Parliament , and published much of the pro-repeal literature written by Priestley and others.

I know  American Revolution  is the most widely-used term, so it's not a big deal. I just have to always be difficult. (By splitting my infinitives, for example.)           The reason I use it here is because it was often used at the time. Does that tame your bristles?  Awadewit  |  talk  11:40, 2 December 2007 (UTC)           Yeah, I guess. Actually, I think it's just a personal problem. I know people don't mean anything by it. I should get over it. Â  Scartol Â Â  Tok  14:57, 2 December 2007 (UTC)           I split infinitives, too, by the way. Do you know why English has that rule? In the eighteenth-century, when grammarians were codifying English grammar (part of nation-building and imperialism projects), they looked to Latin and since Latin doesn't split its infinitives, they decided English shouldn't either. However, the Latin rules make sense for that language while they don't for ours. The grammarians just wanted English to be more Latinate. So, I don't feel bad about splitting.  Awadewit  |  talk  11:36, 2 December 2007 (UTC)           It's really interesting to watch everyday English gradually morphing back into German, putting its verbs at the ends of clauses, with the adverbs just before. I hope I live long enough to see it fully completed.Â ;)  Willow  12:28, 2 December 2007 (UTC)           Very interesting. I learned something about the language today. Now I have to offer a language fact. Umm, let's see. Did you know  Bling bling  was entered into the  OED  in 2003? Â  Scartol Â Â  Tok  14:57, 2 December 2007 (UTC)           Yes, I saw that.

Awadewit  |  talk  11:36, 2 December 2007 (UTC)           Oh, absolutely. I was referring only to the wording of the tail end of that sentence. Â  Scartol Â Â  Tok  14:57, 2 December 2007 (UTC)           Oh, I see. Changed.  Awadewit  |  talk  17:34, 2 December 2007 (UTC)                   ""Important early publications"" seems like an odd subhead title, given all the other important publications which have already been mentioned.           I know - it is an artifact of an older version before we had all of these new, exciting sections. Do you have any ideas? That section is kind of disparate.  Awadewit  |  talk  11:36, 2 December 2007 (UTC)           ""Publishing variety""? How about ""Teeth, antimony, and women""?

The earlier parts of the article seem to make this clear.           Just in case someone skips to this part of the article. Also, it's a nice little summary to remind readers of the chronology, I think.  Awadewit  |  talk  11:49, 2 December 2007 (UTC)           Fair enough. Â  Scartol Â Â  Tok  14:57, 2 December 2007 (UTC)               Why is only one of Cowper's books redlinked?           This is Cowper's major poem. It deserves a page - there is tons of stuff written on it. I'm not totally sure you could write a page on the others. I would have to look into it and see how much scholarship there is.  Awadewit  |  talk           Makes sense. Â  Scartol Â Â  Tok  14:57, 2 December 2007 (UTC)               Quotes like ""the botanist who brought the Linnaean system to England"" which aren't attributed in the article make me uneasy; I much prefer the  Chard emphasizes that it ""was held together""  variety. Maybe this is  WP:ILIKEIT .           This kind of quote does not need to be attributed in my opinion because it is not just one person's theory on Linnaeus. The only reason I have it in quotation marks is because I am using the precise words of the author. However, the idea is widely held. I only attribute quotations or ideas that belong (intellectually) to an author. Otherwise, the prose just becomes weighted down.  Awadewit  |  talk  11:49, 2 December 2007 (UTC)           Okay, I trust you on it. I suppose I've just trained myself to attribute every quote within the text itself. Personal preference, I guess.               I don't know how relevant the deviance from 90 of the house's walls is. Or how grammatically correct that sentence I just wrote is.           I thought the walls were funny in an otherwise dry article. Oh well. The walls have been taken down.  Awadewit  |  talk  11:49, 2 December 2007 (UTC)           I agree it's very interesting  I just worry that someone else will demand their removal. I don't mean to make you pull a  Pink Floyd .

This sentence doesn't make sense to me. Am I missing something, or does it need to be split in two?           Now reads:  Johnson's periodical, the   Analytical Review , published a summary and review of Burke's work within a couple of weeks of its publication. Two weeks after that, Wollstonecraft responded to Burke with her   Vindication of the Rights of Men .  Awadewit  |  talk  11:58, 2 December 2007 (UTC)           Excellent .

Awadewit  |  talk  12:11, 2 December 2007 (UTC)           I think it's pretty important; perhaps he would've been a Wikipedian in our time?  Willow  12:36, 2 December 2007 (UTC)           I think so. I mean the  Analytical Review  wanted to  inform  people, did it not? (Did you see the cool new info I added on it being a part of the ""encyclopedizing"" movement of the eighteenth century?)  Awadewit  |  talk  12:47, 2 December 2007 (UTC)           I think it would fit in the ""1760s: Beginnings in publishing"" section. (I searched for ""encyclo"" and found nothing.) Â  Scartol Â Â  Tok  14:57, 2 December 2007 (UTC)           Well, it's there:  In repackaging other publications for its readers, the Analytical Review was part of the encyclopedic movement of the eighteenth century. The journal shared in the desire to organize and classify knowledge for its readers while at the same time recognizing the ultimate futility of the project. In so doing, the journal's editors believed that they were preserving the knowledge of the past and the present for the future.   Awadewit  |  talk  17:34, 2 December 2007 (UTC)           Yeesh!

Awadewit  |  talk  22:59, 5 December 2007 (UTC)           In that case, why make it a direct quotation at all? -- Markus Poessel  ( talk ) 18:01, 6 December 2007 (UTC)           Now moved to last paragraph of lead with original quotation.  Awadewit  |  talk  18:42, 12 December 2007 (UTC)                   ""issued primarily religious works"" - did he issue works that were mostly religious in nature, or did he mostly issue works that were religious? (I'm not saying this needs to be changed, just probing for possible ambiguities.)           He issued more religious works than any other kind of work. I think this is clear from context, but let me know if we should reword.  Awadewit  |  talk  22:59, 5 December 2007 (UTC)           How about ""primarily issued religious works"" then? Should remove the possible confusion. -- Markus Poessel  ( talk ) 18:01, 6 December 2007 (UTC)           Changed.  Awadewit  |  talk  21:16, 8 December 2007 (UTC)                   ""particularly at his famous weekly dinners (the regulars subsequently became known as the ""Johnson Circle"").""  is there a nicer way to append the sentence in parentheses? ""(the regular attendants of which later became known as""  also, I would like ""later"" better than ""subsequently"", since there is no clearly defined point in time for the ""subsequent"" to attach to.           Now reads:  He fostered the open discussion of new ideas, particularly at his famous weekly dinners, the regular attendees of which later became known as the ""Johnson Circle"".           ""supporters of the French revolution and""  probably a comma after ""revolution""?           Added.  Awadewit  |  talk  22:59, 5 December 2007 (UTC)           ""Religious Dissent marked Johnson""  is this precisely what you want to say? The subsequent statements sounds like ""J grew up in a climate of Religious Dissent"" or similar.           I mean both: he grew up in a climate and that climate imprinted itself upon his character.  Awadewit  |  talk  21:16, 8 December 2007 (UTC)           I guess that with transitive ""mark"" I'm so used to ""marked out as"" as to find the use here a bit off, but that's probably just me. - Markus Poessel  ( talk ) 18:04, 14 December 2007 (UTC)           This is another literary usage, but is far more common. Women are ""marked"", for example. Yet another meaning!  Awadewit  |  talk  05:36, 15 December 2007 (UTC)                   ""Practice of Innoculation [sic]""  should the ""[sic]"" be in italics?           It already is.  Awadewit  |  talk  22:59, 5 December 2007 (UTC)           That's why I'm asking: it is, but should it be? -- Markus Poessel  ( talk ) 18:01, 6 December 2007 (UTC)           Yes - it is an abbreviation from the Latin.  Awadewit  |  talk  21:16, 8 December 2007 (UTC)           I know the meaning, and I know it's usually italicized when added to ordinary, non-italic text, so I was wondering whether it needed to be non-italic when added to text that is, itself, in italics. Admittedly a minor point. -- Markus Poessel  ( talk ) 22:27, 10 December 2007 (UTC)           The italics for  sic  are independent of the surrounding text.  Awadewit  |  talk  18:42, 12 December 2007 (UTC)           Live and learn... - Markus Poessel  ( talk ) 18:04, 14 December 2007 (UTC)                               ""opened his own business; however""  why ""however""? In what sense does the account of him moving shop limit the validity of the statement that he opened his own business?           I found it hard to formulate this sentence - moving his business made it hard for him to establish himself. One isn't a stable businessman if one is moving about so much.Â :)  Awadewit  |  talk  22:59, 5 December 2007 (UTC)           It depends. If you're moving to better and better locations, it means your business is thriving. -- Markus Poessel  ( talk ) 18:01, 6 December 2007 (UTC)           He wasn't moving to a better location as far as I know - when he was, we try to say so: ""By August 1770, just seven months after fire had destroyed his shop and goods, Johnson had reestablished himself at 72 St. Paul's Churchyardthe largest store on a street of booksellerswhere he remained for the rest of his life.""  Awadewit  |  talk  21:16, 8 December 2007 (UTC)           In any case, some additional insertion (for instance ""however, he found it hard to establish himself, moving ..."" would make it clearer, I think. -- Markus Poessel  ( talk ) 22:27, 10 December 2007 (UTC)           Now reads:  Upon completing his apprenticeship in 1761, Johnson opened his own business; however, he struggled to establish himself, moving his shop times within one year.   Awadewit  |  talk  18:42, 12 December 2007 (UTC)                           ""However, as a publisher Johnson did not just sell books.""  not quite what it is meant to be. Probably should be something like ""However, it should be noted that, in Johnson's time, the role of a publisher included much more than just selling books"" or similar (I don't like the ""role"" in my sentence, but you can see what I mean).           Now reads:  As a publisher Johnson did more than sell books.  (It is wordy to add phrases such as ""it should be noted that"").  Awadewit  |  talk  02:51, 6 December 2007 (UTC)           Coming back to this, I guess that  no  publisher just sells books  after all, per definition they arrange for the editing, the printing, and so on, as well. Hm. How about something along the lines  However, Johnson did more than just tend to the logistics of publication. He also... ? -- Markus Poessel  ( talk ) 18:01, 6 December 2007 (UTC)           Now reads:  As a publisher Johnson attended to more than the selling and distributing of books.   Awadewit  |  talk  21:16, 8 December 2007 (UTC)                   congers: briefly explain in the text. Readers should be able to understand this article without clicking on wikilinks.           ""which spread the risk of publishing a costly or inflammatory book among several firms"" - This is not enough? (By the way, I think wikilinks are one of the best things about wikipedia - I don't think that everything can possibly be explained inside a single article. For example, I can't explain the  French revolution  in this article. The balance is tricky, I admit, but the fact that readers can so easily be taken to further explanations is one of the best parts of the online experience, in my opinion.)  Awadewit  |  talk  02:51, 6 December 2007 (UTC)           I don't think it's enough, since the reader doesn't automatically know that the ""which spread"" is the main reason for forming a conger, not just some additional side effect you mention here. ""congers, that is, special syndicates set up to spread the risk of publishing..."" might be better. I think a WP article should be written in a way that it is readable without the average curious reader feeling compelled to follow any wikilink. That reader has heard about the French Revolution, but not necessarily about congers. -- Markus Poessel  ( talk ) 18:01, 6 December 2007 (UTC)           Now reads:  other publishers began including him in congers, a syndicate which spread the risk of publishing a costly or inflammatory book among several firms .  Awadewit  |  talk  21:16, 8 December 2007 (UTC)           Sorry to be picky once more, but shouldn't the syndicates be plural, if the congers are? -- Markus Poessel  ( talk ) 22:27, 10 December 2007 (UTC)           Syndicates are now plural.  Awadewit  |  talk  18:42, 12 December 2007 (UTC)                           ""Johnson formed two friendships that shaped the rest of his life.""  as they probably didn't immediately shape the rest of his life: ""two friendships that were to shape the rest of his life""?           Changed verb tense.  Awadewit  |  talk  02:51, 6 December 2007 (UTC)           ""Fuseli was Johnson's closest friend until his death.""  the only concrete date given is the beginning of the friendship, so perhaps ""was to remain J.'s closest friend"" would be better?           Changed.  Awadewit  |  talk  02:51, 6 December 2007 (UTC)           ""This friendship led Johnson to discard the Baptist faith of his youth and adopt Unitarianism, as well as other forms of religious and political dissent.""  help me out on this: wasn't Baptist faith a form of dissent, too? In which case this sentence appears to build too much of a contrast (Baptism here, dissent there).           Not worth going into. Now reads:  This friendship led Johnson to discard the Baptist faith of his youth and adopt Unitarianism as well as pursue forms of political dissent.   Awadewit  |  talk  02:51, 6 December 2007 (UTC)           ""Priestley, in turn, trusted Johnson enough to handle the logistics of his induction into the Royal Society.""  what logistics were those? It would be great if this could be re-written in a way that the average reader immediately understand why this was a sign of trust.           I don't know, unfortunately. Priestley just let Johnson handle a lot of his correspondence and a couple of the biographers made a bit of a deal out of him letting Johnson handle this particular element of it - probably because becoming a member of the Royal Society was such an honor and it meant a lot to Priestley. Nothing very interesting, there, I'm afraid.  Awadewit  |  talk  02:51, 6 December 2007 (UTC)           When in doubt, leave it out? -- Markus Poessel  ( talk ) 18:01, 6 December 2007 (UTC)           But this is only tidbit showing the other side of the friendship. I think it is important to leave it in.  Awadewit  |  talk  21:16, 8 December 2007 (UTC)           But again, without the details, do we even know this was a sign of special trust? -- Markus Poessel  ( talk ) 22:27, 10 December 2007 (UTC)           We trust the sources - the historians' interpretation of events.  Awadewit  |  talk  18:42, 12 December 2007 (UTC)           Yes and no. We should trust the sources, but in cases like this, where the source apparently doesn't give us sufficient information for at least a plausibility check how the interpretation came about, we should be careful. Which, here, could mean just attributing the interpretation explicitly  including it as a quote. - Markus Poessel  ( talk ) 18:04, 14 December 2007 (UTC)           I just don't think this is important enough to quote. The notes are available for the reader, if they want to check them.  Awadewit  |  talk  05:36, 15 December 2007 (UTC)                                   ""The late 1760s were a time of growing radicalism in Britain, and although Johnson did not actively participate in any of the events""  how come we're talking about events now? What events?           The late 1760s were a time of growing radicalism in Britain, and although Johnson did not actively participate in any of the events, he facilitated the speech of those who did, by publishing works on the disputed election of John Wilkes and the agitation in the American colonies.  - I think the whole sentence makes it clearer - the John Wilkes election fiasco and the beginning of the American revolution. It is important to make sure that readers know what is going on at each point in history, I think, and what the person's relation to it is. In this case, it is even more important, since Johnson becomes more active politically later.  Awadewit  |  talk  02:51, 6 December 2007 (UTC)   How about ""in any of the events taking place""? I just don't think (small point, admittedly) that the reader can be expected to know that the ""growing radicalism"" was tied to specific events. It could have been a trend in publishing, in the way laws were introduced in parliament, etc. - Markus Poessel  ( talk ) 18:04, 14 December 2007 (UTC)           You're asking for a redundancy to be inserted - events always ""take place"". We don't need to tell readers that. I think that we can safely say that readers will assume that the events are the ones listed and will tie ""events"" to ""radicalism"".  Awadewit  |  talk  05:36, 15 December 2007 (UTC)           Not quite redundancy, but possibly not the best way of putting this. The proper way of doing this would be to say that it was a time of radicalism, indicate that this radicalism can be tied to specific events, and then take J didn't take part in those events. ""The late 1760s were a time of growing radicalism in Britain, crystallizing in events such as the John Wilkes election fiasco and <please insert another event here>. Although Johnson did not actively participate..."" -- Markus Poessel  ( talk ) 21:58, 18 December 2007 (UTC)           I am really quite comfortable with this sentence as it stands. I think it is quite clear; it defines the growing radicalism through the events that Johnson didn't participate in but published works about, a fair and accurate statement:  The late 1760s were a time of growing radicalism in Britain, and although Johnson did not actively participate in any of the events, he facilitated the speech of those who did, by publishing works on the disputed election of John Wilkes and the agitation in the American colonies.   Awadewit  |  talk  06:23, 20 December 2007 (UTC)                       ""By August 1770, just seven months after fire had destroyed his shop and goods, Johnson had reestablished himself at 72 St. Paul's Churchyardthe largest store on a street of booksellerswhere he remained for the rest of his life.""  again, somehow ""where he would remain"" sounds better to my ear, may be because it fits better with the preceding tenses.           I agree, but many FAC reviewers seem to have a problem with the ""would"" formulation. I've become skittish, frankly.  Awadewit  |  talk  03:05, 6 December 2007 (UTC)   Ah, OK - ""where he was to remain"", then? -- Markus Poessel  ( talk ) 18:01, 6 December 2007 (UTC)           Changed.  Awadewit  |  talk  21:16, 8 December 2007 (UTC)               ""Starting in the 1770s, Johnson published fewer generalized religious tracts""  ""generalized""? From what? ""Fewer tracts on the subject of religion in general""?           Changed to:  Johnson published more specifically  Unitarian  works, as well as texts advocating religious toleration; he also became personally involved in the Unitarian cause.   Awadewit  |  talk  03:05, 6 December 2007 (UTC)           ""Johnson actively participated in efforts to repeal the Test and Corporation Acts""  I keep trying to think of a way you can ""participate in efforts"" other than ""actively"". But may be it's just me.           I suppose I was just trying to emphasize that he did more than publish works, but I see your point. Removed ""actively"".  Awadewit  |  talk  03:05, 6 December 2007 (UTC)           ""Although Johnson became known for publishing Unitarian works, particularly those of Priestley, he also published the works of other Dissenters, Anglicans, and Jews.""  I know what you mean, but it sounds a bit off. The ""Although"" refers only to the fact that most people know him as a publisher of X (while he was also a publisher of Y), but as it is written, it sounds as if being known for publishing X would somehow restrict the publishing of Y. Either ""it is a fact that he also"" or something about his other activities being less well-known?           Now in the present tense:  Although Johnson is known for publishing Unitarian works, particularly those of Priestley, he also published the works of other Dissenters,  Anglicans , and  Jews .   Awadewit  |  talk  03:05, 6 December 2007 (UTC)           ""a political risk as the American colonies were in rebellion""  an additional ""by that time"" would be good, seeing that we're tracing developments starting at a time before the revolution.           Added for clarification.  Awadewit  |  talk  03:05, 6 December 2007 (UTC)           ""because Dr. James's Fever Powder was quite popular and his fellow bookseller John Newbery made his fortune from it.""  ""had made his fortune"", probably. And how? Did the bookseller sell medicine, as well? Had he sold books about it? A brief explanation would be welcome.           Changed to ""had made his fortune from selling it"". I don't want to go into a big tangent here on Newbery's fortune. I plan on writing the Newbery article someday - all will be explained in more detail there. (Hopefully the reader remembers the quote about publishers selling medicines in particular from earlier in the article!)  Awadewit  |  talk  20:45, 8 December 2007 (UTC)           ""Johnson also contributed significantly to the development of children's literature in the eighteenth century, a genre that was just then emerging.""  reads a bit strange. The genre is ""children's literature in the eighteenth century""? Or ""children's literature""? May be this should be two sentences. Or a different construction (""the newly emerging genre of..."").           Changed to ""newly emerging genre of"" - less wordy.  Awadewit  |  talk  20:45, 8 December 2007 (UTC)           ""become the center of a radical and stimulating intellectual milieu""  can something become the ""center"" of a ""milieu""? Or is that a mildly mixed metaphor (literally, I suppose a ""milieu"" is itself the ""center of the place"")?           Oh, it can't? Hm. The definition is just ""the physical or social setting in which something occurs or develops"", so I think there can be a center. I've always had the feeling that ""milieu"" is pretty diffuse.  Awadewit  |  talk  20:45, 8 December 2007 (UTC)           I don't know  but in cases like this, where the exact attributes of some vague term like milieu are not universally known (as I conclude from our small sample-of-two), one should probably refrain from using the term           Well, the exact attributes of all abstract words in historical and literary articles are not universally known. Definitions are notoriously tricky things in language. This one doesn't strike me as very odd. I asked a few other people and they didn't think this was a strange formulation, but they were literary types like myself. Let's see if it gives anyone else pause.  Awadewit  |  talk  18:42, 12 December 2007 (UTC)                   ""he usually had only one assistant and never hired an apprentice""  were apprentices ""hired"" at that time? Weren't they indentured or something? ""never took on an apprentice"" probably covers everything.           Changed to ""took on"".  Awadewit  |  talk  20:45, 8 December 2007 (UTC)           ""Johnson published Cowper's Poems (1782) and The Task (1784) at his own risk""  isn't that the norm rather than the exception, publishers publishing at their own risk? I assume that this is not what you intend to stress here; it's more about the risk, in this case, being larger than usual, right?           Many times in the eighteenth century, authors published at their own risk ( Jane Austen  did this, for example). In this case, Johnson took the risk (which was also riskier for him) - both meanings are intended.  Awadewit  |  talk  20:45, 8 December 2007 (UTC)           Ah, OK. That is an important information that should definitely be in there for the non-18th-century-savvy reader. How about ""at his own risk; a remarkable step in an age where most authors published at their own risk"" or similar (it can certainly be put more elegantly). - Markus Poessel  ( talk ) 18:04, 14 December 2007 (UTC)           Now reads:  Johnson published Cowper's Poems (1782) and The Task (1784) at his own risk (a generous action at a time when most authors published at their own risk), and was rewarded with handsome sales of both volumes.   Awadewit  |  talk                   ""where they would be sure to see his wares and this helped establish him""  comma after wares?           Optional - I think the second half is so short as to not need it, but since you do, I have added it.  Awadewit  |  talk  20:45, 8 December 2007 (UTC)           ""James Edward Smith, ""the botanist who brought the Linnaean system to England"".[57]""  any reason why this should be a direct quotation? To me, that's suspiciously close to overdoing it.           I just couldn't think of another wording at the time; I was also worried if I just replaced the verb, it would still be plagiarizing in spirit.  Awadewit  |  talk  20:45, 8 December 2007 (UTC)           Is credited with bringing the Linnaean system? Introduced the Linnaean system? Remembered for bringing the Linnaean system? Whose claim to fame is to have brought the Linnaean system? Was instrumental in bringing the Linnaean system? Was responsible for bringing/introducing? -- Markus Poessel  ( talk ) 18:04, 14 December 2007 (UTC)           But that's just it - simply replacing the verb can still be considered plagiarism. I'm just changing one or two words. Until the entire phrase can be changed, the quotation remains.  Awadewit  |  talk  05:36, 15 December 2007 (UTC)           I'd guess that, for small sentences like this, you cannot define plagiarism that strictly. ""credited with introducing the Linnaean system of taxonomy to English scholars""? I just think that making it a quotation introduces an emphasis that is confusing. -- Markus Poessel  ( talk ) 21:58, 18 December 2007 (UTC)           I'm afraid that I'm going to have to be a stickler about this. Plagiarism in the humanities is taken quite seriously and I cannot afford to write anything that has even the whiff of plagiarism about it nor am I interested in doing so.  Awadewit  |  talk  06:23, 20 December 2007 (UTC)                           ""book on lithotomy was illustrated by William Blake as well""  comma before ""as well"". Assuming that whoever wrote this has run out of commas, here's a free sample: ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,.           Oops - added.  Awadewit  |  talk  20:45, 8 December 2007 (UTC)           ""notions of the element and the compound""  I'm a bit bothered by the definite article (but again, may be that's just me). ""of an element and of a compound""?           I was going for the abstract - ""the notion"" - the idea - not any old element or compound. Does that make sense?  Awadewit  |  talk  20:45, 8 December 2007 (UTC)           You explicitly say ""notions""  is that not sufficient indication? -- Markus Poessel  ( talk ) 18:04, 14 December 2007 (UTC)           But then using ""a"" detracts from that idea, in my opinion.  Awadewit  |  talk  05:36, 15 December 2007 (UTC)           Can you leave out the articles altogether? The notions of element and compound? I'm not sure about how to handle this, but ""the"" sounds off somehow. -- Markus Poessel  ( talk ) 21:58, 18 December 2007 (UTC)           Changed.  Awadewit  |  talk  06:23, 20 December 2007 (UTC)                           ""By bringing inventive, thoughtful people together, he ""stood at the very heart of British intellectual life"" for over twenty years.""  this sounds, once more, odd. How can you stand by bringing people together? I think this links one too directly to the other. Especially since the first is true of many people, the last of very few.           I don't really sense the oddness - he's not ""standing by"" - he's ""standing"" metaphorically (also meaning ""representing""). I also don't think very many people bring together ""circles"" like Johnson did.  Awadewit  |  talk  20:45, 8 December 2007 (UTC)           Just a bit uneasiness about bringing metaphors too close together. The very heart is metaphoric, and he's standing metaphorically. How about ""secured for himself a position at the very heart of""? I won't push this, it was just something that struck me as slightly oddish. - Markus Poessel  ( talk ) 18:04, 14 December 2007 (UTC)           How did he do this ""securing""? That has whole different connotations for me and in an eighteenth-century context, it sounds like he influenced people to get his position, which he didn't exactly. One usually ""secures"" positions at court or employment, if you see what I mean.  Awadewit  |  talk  05:36, 15 December 2007 (UTC)                   ""and is believed to have written some 200 articles for his periodical, the Analytical Review""  why the uncertainty? Few copies survive? Articles written under an assumed name, or anonymously?           Written under initials - we don't know for sure. This is explained in the  Analytical Review  article, where the details of contributions to that journal are explained in much greater detail.  Awadewit  |  talk  20:45, 8 December 2007 (UTC)           If you can add some explanatory sentence to this effect, it would make for smoother reading. - Markus Poessel  ( talk ) 18:04, 14 December 2007 (UTC)           I think the details are best left to the  Analytical Review  article, because the reasons behind the anonymity take a bit to explain and they are not crucial for this article.

Did he offer her work despite her not knowing any foreign languages? That sounds a bit odd. Or did he offer her work for some languages she already knew, encouraging her later to widen her linguistic range?           She did not know the languages - she learned them as she was translating, yes. The oddness is correct.Â :)  Awadewit  |  talk  20:45, 8 December 2007 (UTC)           ""Johnson encouraged Wollstonecraft to work as a translator, prompting her""? Not exactly the same (doesn't say that he actually offered her concrete projects  I didn't want to repeat ""work""), but, in my view, less confusing. - Markus Poessel  ( talk ) 18:04, 14 December 2007 (UTC)           He did offer her translation projects, though, so that has to made clear. How about:  Johnson provided Wollstonecraft with translation opportunities, prompting her to learn French and German.   Awadewit  |  talk  05:36, 15 December 2007 (UTC)                   ""Society for Constitutional Information""  please add a half-sentence explanations. Readers shouldn't have to click.           Added ""which was attempting to reform Parliament"". I usually only add these when I think they will be helpful. I'm not sure this one explains anything. Sometimes people just have to read more if they really want to know, I'm afraid.  Awadewit  |  talk  20:45, 8 December 2007 (UTC)           ""his willingness to publish works that reflected the ""challenging new historicist versions of the scriptures""""  is ""reflected"" the right word here? Can works reflect a version?           It's a common word in literary criticism, but I'll change it as I don't think it is common for other people. New word: ""expressed"".  Awadewit  |  talk  20:45, 8 December 2007 (UTC)           ""promoted""? - Markus Poessel  ( talk ) 18:04, 14 December 2007 (UTC)           Changed.  Awadewit  |  talk  05:36, 15 December 2007 (UTC)                   Edmund Burke  again, think of your poorly schooled readership and please add some epithets: ""the well-known statesman and philosopher E.B.""?           Added ""philosopher and statesman"".  Awadewit  |  talk  20:55, 8 December 2007 (UTC)           ""bestselling poetical works of Cowper and Darwin""  I think most readers will not remember the single earlier mention of Darwin, namely that this is Erasmus Darwin. Somehow, Darwin falls from the sky here, without introduction. I think this should change, including a more explicit statement that we're talking with nature-inspired poetry here. Cowper and his work are properly introduced in earlier parts of the article; why not Darwin?           Are you saying there should be more on Darwin and Johnson overall? One reason for the most extensive Cowper information is that Johnson and Cowper had more of a personal relationship than Darwin and Johnson. (I've added ""Erasmus Darwin"" to avoid the confusion.)  Awadewit  |  talk  20:55, 8 December 2007 (UTC)           May be a sentence or two; I think it's an interesting sidelight. - Markus Poessel  ( talk ) 18:04, 14 December 2007 (UTC)           Material added.  Awadewit  |  talk  20:53, 16 December 2007 (UTC)                   ""They were apparently close enough friends for Coleridge to leave his books at Johnson's shop when he toured Europe.""  how does this indicate close friendship?           According to the sources it does. I suppose you have to think of how expensive books were at the time. They were not easy to replace. Johnson was like Coleridge's safety-deposit box.  Awadewit  |  talk  20:55, 8 December 2007 (UTC)           Anything small you can add to  make  the reader think of how expensive books were at the time would be good, I think. - Markus Poessel  ( talk ) 18:04, 14 December 2007 (UTC)           Unfortunately, this would be  WP:SYN .

Changed.

That is all I know.  Awadewit  |  talk  20:55, 8 December 2007 (UTC)           What does the source say? Even adding ""the whereabouts of which are, however, unknown"" or similar would be better than just to leave it dangling. - Markus Poessel  ( talk ) 18:04, 14 December 2007 (UTC)           Just removed the sentence - not crucial.  Awadewit  |  talk  05:36, 15 December 2007 (UTC)                   ""one of the women writers Johnson promoted and assisted, who also thought of him as a brother and a father""  where does the ""also"" come from? What else are we told she thought? Or who else thought of J. as a brother and a father?           Removed ""also"".  Awadewit  |  talk  20:55, 8 December 2007 (UTC)           ""this was expected at the time""  ""this did not surprise his contemporaries""  or did they come to expect, which always carries a bit of its other meaning of claiming something as ones right, shoddy quality?           It was expected of ephemeral literature at the time, whether printed by Johnson or not. Changed to ""this was expected by his contemporaries"".  Awadewit  |  talk  20:55, 8 December 2007 (UTC)         -- Markus Poessel  ( talk ) 22:12, 5 December 2007 (UTC)     [ edit ]   Hairspray (2007 film)   I've listed this article for peer review because it has reached GA status and I would like to someday see it become a featured article. I'm a bit unsure as to what needs to be done to this artice before it can reach this status, and I was hoping that a peer review could help to improve the overall quality of the article.   Thanks,   Mears man  ( talk ) 04:08, 26 November 2007 (UTC)     I'll see if I can review the article to help improve it, though I don't have the time today. A few points, though: 1) Remove the YouTube video external links -- they are both potential copyright violations and inappropriately embedded in the article body. 2) Reduce the length of the Cast section to only the major roles. This is an encyclopedia, so we should not  indiscriminately  list every actor in the film. We have the the film's end credits and IMDb's electronic copy for that. 3) For critical reviews, can you specify more about what film critics liked or disliked about the film? I think that the reviews could elaborate more on the pros and cons rather than their general opinion, such as ""well-paced story"" or ""badly developed characters"". I've put the peer review on my watchlist, so feel free to respond (which will help remind me to review the content more closely). Hope you can make these changes!  Erik  ( talk    contrib ) - 15:55, 26 November 2007 (UTC)           I went ahead and removed the YouTube links from the Deleted Scenes subsection, but I'm tempted to remove the section entirely, seeing as it doesn't significantly contribute to the article and really only serves to take up space. What do you think? Also, I believe that the Council Members portion of the cast list could be removed, seeing as they're mostly non-notable actors who's only line in the film was to say the name of their character, but what are your views on the Cameos section? I personally find this section to be interesting (I certainly wouldn't have picked up on a lot of it on my own), but I can also see where it might need to be removed. I'll try to work on the critical reviews section as time permits, but I do have a few real world obligations to deal with at the moment (the term is coming to an end and quite a few papers are due), so it may be a bit before I'm really able to sit down and sift through them. Still, I'll see what I can do.  Mears man  ( talk ) 18:31, 26 November 2007 (UTC)               I decided to go ahead and remove the Council members subsection, but I've left the Cameos part up for the moment until I hear what others thoughts on that are.  Mears man  ( talk ) 15:28, 27 November 2007 (UTC)           A script has been used to generate a semi- automated  review of the article for issues relating to grammar and  house  style. If you would find such a review helpful, please click  here . Thanks,  APR Â  t  02:46, 29 November 2007 (UTC)       As suggested by the script, I went ahead and expanded the lead section to comply with the guidelines set by  Wikipedia:Lead section . I tried my best to cover the remaining portions of the article in what I added, but would you mind taking a look at it to see if you have any suggestions for improvement?  Mears man  ( talk ) 16:23, 9 December 2007 (UTC)     Somebody posted a comment on the article's talk page, suggesting that the Cast section be removed, seeing as it's somewhat redundant. They argued that, because the actors are covered in the infobox, plot section, and pre-production and casting section, having a separate section to only list the actors and their roles seemed a bit unnecessary. While they do make a good point, it seems to me that most film articles include a cast section, so I'm still a bit unsure. Any thoughts or suggestions? Also, if the cast section were to be removed, would the cameos section be removed along with it, or is there another part of the article that that could fit in with?  Mears man  ( talk ) 04:19, 6 December 2007 (UTC)     In my experience, a straightforward Cast section does not add a whole lot to a film article. There are other sources that compile the entire cast, such as IMDb. My approach is to write real-world context about the cast in the film. I've done a ""Casting"" subsection under the ""Production"" subsection (see  Fight Club (film)#Casting ) and a ""Cast"" section in which there is prose and a list of bulleted entries that contain some real-world context for each character (see  Sunshine (2007 film)#Cast ). I consider it a more unique and encyclopedic approach. That's my $0.02.Â :)  Erik  ( talk    contrib ) - 04:24, 6 December 2007 (UTC)     Okay, I've gone through most of the reviews and tried to add more information about their specific likes/dislikes (I think there may have been one that I didn't expand on because I couldn't find much else worth mentioning). Any thoughts, suggestions? Did I add too much, not enough, or just the right amount? Was this the kind of stuff you were looking for?

Music was never invented; Birds sing, water drips, leaves rustle, fire crackles, and so on. It might be better to ask, ""Who first realized that the world is so filled with music?""   No one knows. Caveman used to make music.   Pope Gregory the First wrote music around 600 AD   Music wasn't ""invented"" only discovered. Everyone hums, taps, beats, etc. Early indians created music. Music goes as far back as human existence.   I don't believe one single person can be credited with ""inventing"" music. Music has existed since prehistoric times and predates the written word.   Music in terms of sound created by people for perposes of enjoyment has been around as long as people have. Music theory (noted music, and rules for forming it) didn't start showing up until later, though. The earliest evidence of notated music is from about 2000 BCE, and it was very simple. More developed forms showed up later.     http://westsounds.com                                                                      First answer by ID3486020746.  Last edit by  Brigb93 .

They realised the geometrical nature of musical notes and did much for the development of music.  Music was an important subject in education and even more imprtant for the education of young women.  Music was one of the arts that women participated in actively.  The lyre and the flute were the most important instruments.  A number of pictures follow with women involved with music:      maenad, in a peplos, plays the barbiton, with the plektron in her right hand. Her hair is in a krobylos secured by a stephane with leaves.     a woman walks to the right while playing a cradle kithara decorated with a pair of eyes.    woman playing flute    woman playing double flute    a girl, wearing a medium-sleeved chiton and a narrow stephane, stands profile to the right, holding a lyre in her left hand and a plectrum in her right hand    symposium, on the right stands a girl, profile to the left, wearing a peplos and playing the double flute    Girl Girl playing flute.

Answer: 'One member of the Crotonian school, Alcmaeon, achieved great distinction in both anatomy and physiology.  He first recognized the brain as the organ of the mind, and made careful dissections of the nerves, which he traced to the brain. He described the optic nerves and the Eustachian tubes, made correct observations upon vision, and refuted the common view that the sperma came from the spinal cord.  He suggested the definition of health as the maintenance of equilibrium, or an ""isonomy"" in the material qualities of the body.'  Reference    Question: Archytas of Tarentum   Answer:  Bio    Question: how did the make the insrtuments   Answer: The ancient Greek instruments were made of wood, metal, or ivory. Wood was joined with hide glue, pegged, or bound.  The strings were made of animal gut.  The flutes were made of metal, bone or wood.  The used a double reed but it is not clear what the reed was made of.  It had to be a strong, flexible material like ivory.  Simple wood working tools were used to make the instruments.  These included saws, chisels, clamps, and sand-stone for smoothing.  Finishes included oils and waxes.  No solvent paints were available but some resins could be applied with heat.   Question: do the women play the harp   Answer: The ancient Greek women played instruments. There was the lyre, the barbiton and the kithara.  The lyre was made of horns connected to a tortise shell while a cithara was of similar shaped but made of wood.  Later the cithara became the guitar.  The barbiton was similar to a lyre but came from Persia.  The Harpa was an Egyptian instrument similar to the harp.   Question: when was the earlyest greek inventin made   Answer: The earliest inventions were attributed to gods and goddesses but no date was ever attached to these.  For example Hermes invented the lyre and Athena invented weaving.  Question:  What was the government of Corinth.  Answer: In the 7th century BC, a man called Kypselos overthrew the government of Corinth. He made himself ruler of the city state. This kind of leader is called a tyrant. When Kypselos died, his son Periander took over the role of tyrant.  Soon after Periander's death, Corinth was ruled by a council of 80 men. This type of government is called an oligarchy.   Question: How did the position of women in Troy change over the period of the Trojan Wars   Answer: In general, during the war they were free and at the end of the war they became slaves.  Specifically the fortunes of a woman depended upon the fortunes of her husband.  If he should be killed her fortunes might change dramatically.  She would be lucky to get a new husband.   Question: what is the difference between ancient greek wemon and wemon today how have they changed.   Answer: Only their attitude, religion, and opportunities have changed Greek women were free of most taboos but they were not required to be educated. Even so they had many educational opportunities.  Women in the west have a similar situation but women in the rest of the world do not.  Western women have better health care than the ladies of ancient Greece while many women in the west of the world suffer poor health care.  Slavery was present in ancient Greece and women were the primary slaves.  Today slavery of women is rare. Women in ancient Greece lived in a very dynamic and passionate time and they benefited from this enthusiasm.  Too many women today live lives of quiet desperation or are under the influence of drugs.  Many people today focus on themselves and what they can get, unlike the more community minded Ancient Greeks.   Question: what was the most common dance and music in Ancient Greece   Answer: This is a difficult question to answer as neither could be easily recorded.  There have been some efforts to reconstruct this but one usually guesses in term of current practice.  We can conclude however that they are nothing like the classical music that we are used to.   Question: Mythical Greek Lyre-player   Answer: Epameinondas was a lyre player but he was historical.  Orpheus was a legendary lyre player from just before the Trojan war. Arion, friend of King Periannder and a lyre-player, was the first to compose the dithyramb.  The god, Apollo, is also considered a lyre player.   Question: Give me any information about music   Answer: Music was very important to the ancient Greeks.  They realized the rational basis of music and determined that music could be understood with numbers.  This became the basis of polyphonic music notation.

(December 2007)       The Bushmen are a hunting and gathering people of the Kalahari Desert in Southern Africa. There are many interesting aspects of their culture, but their connection with the natural world is mostly expressed through their rock art and healing/trance dances. The healing dances and the Bushmens rock art are both central to the Bushmens way of life, and through them we can learn a lot about their lives.           Contents       1   Healing Dances   2   Healers and Energy   3   Healing   4   Other Occurrences at Healing Dances   5   Becoming a Healer   6   Dances Lasting All Night   7   Rock Paintings and Engravings   8   Learning From Rock Art   9   Production of Rock Art   10   References               [ edit ]   Healing Dances   The Bushmen have an incredible way of healing. According to Rupert Isaacson, who spent time among the Bushmen and is the author of The Healing Land, they have been seen healing a woman of stomach cancer, and causing children who have had chest complaints no longer coughing. Their system has evolved over thousands of years; they heal by using trances. [ 1 ] Healing is a very important part of the Bushmens lives.   The Bushmen have healing rituals. According to Isaacson, they are all-night dances where healers go into a trance in order to cure ailment. These can be physical or psychological in individuals, or for the well being of the community as a whole. They sometimes will tie offerings to animal spirits to the trees, or will use drums in order to contact animal and ancestor spirits. [ 2 ]   The Bushmen trance or healing dances are spectacular affairs. Richard Katz, an associate professor from Harvard University says they have these four times a month, on average. [ 3 ] In her book, The Harmless People, Elizabeth Thomas observes that the women sit in a circle around the fire with their babies on their backs and sing the medicine songs in several parts with falsetto voices and clap their hands in a sharp, staccato rhythm. Behind them the men dance one behind the other and circle around slowly taking very short, pounding steps in counterpoint to the rhythms of the singing and the clapping. This is accompanied by the sharp, high clatter of rattlesmade from dry cocoons strung together with sinew cordsthat are tied to their legs. The dance is a complicated pattern of voices and rhythms that make music that is infinitely varied and always precise. They take great care in these dances, they begin learning the songs and dances when they are children, and work for perfection in skill and timing all their lives. [ 4 ]   [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Healers and Energy   Lorna Marshall, who conducted six expeditions to the Kalahari for the purpose of studying the Bushmen, says that as the dance intensifies, the n/um, or energy, is activated in those that are healers, most of which are the dancing men. The n/um is so strong it can become dangerous. Healers experiencing this must not point their finger fixedly at anyone, especially a child, because a fight or death thing might go along their arm, leap into the child, and kill it. [ 6 ]   Katz also says, the singing of these powerful n/um songs helps awaken the n/um and awaken the healers heart; their heart must be awakened before they can begin to heal. The healer undergoes a transformation, which comes after a painful transition into an enhanced state of consciousness, calledÂ !kia. This connects the healer and their spiritual healing power, and the community. When healers are experiencingÂ !kia they can heal all those at the dance. Â !kia is a very special and extraordinary state. [ 7 ]   [ 8 ]   There are several instances of how the healer undergoes this transformation of intensifying n/um and going intoÂ !kia. Isaacson says, they sometimes dance themselves into a trance, sometimes screaming in pain, and other times laughing or singing. [ 9 ] They can also suddenly fling their arms into the air and with a piercing shriek crash to the ground, as observed by Elizabeth Marshall. [ 10 ]  The transformation experience was described to Richard Katz by an experienced healer, Kinachau, in the following quote:     You dance, dance, dance. Then n/um lifts you up in your belly and lifts you in your back, and then you start to shiver. [N/um] makes you tremble, it's hot. . . . Your eyes are open but you don't look around; you hold your eyes still and look straight ahead. But when you get intoÂ !kia, you're looking around because you see everything, because you see what's troubling everybody . . . n/um enters every part of your body right to the tip of your feet and even your hair. [ 11 ]     So it is a very powerful and mysterious experience. WithoutÂ !kia healers wouldnt be able to cure those around them.     [ edit ]   Healing   Katz also states that the people can only heal when they learn to control their boiling n/um, or energy. The healer learns to pull out sickness from the people. When they do this, they useÂ !kia, or enhanced consciousness, to see the things they need to pull out, like the death things God has put into the people, and they get them out. [ 12 ]   According to Elizabeth Marshall, to cure people and get the evil out of them the medicine man, or healer, will begin by washing his hands in the fire. He then will place one hand on the persons chest, and one on their back, and will suck the evil from them. The medicine man often shudders and groans as he does this, and then will suddenly shriek the evil into the air. [ 13 ]  Katz states that if the person they are healing has a specific symptom, the healers hands focus on sucking the evil out of that area, but if there are no symptoms of illness the healers fluttering and vibrating hands move lightly and sporadically over the persons chest. [ 14 ]   The healers arent just curing sicknesses, like disease, as we might think though. Elizabeth Marshall states in another book, The Old Way, that they are expelling what they call star sickness. This is the force that takes over a group of people and causes jealousy, anger and quarrels and failures of gift giving. It is the evils that pull people apart and damage unity. [ 15 ]  The dance mends the social fabric as it releases hostility according to Katz. To further promote the social cohesion, the healer also pleads with the Gods for relief from harshness. [ 16 ]  So, healing is an important, central part of their lives, because they can then be a unified and peaceful people. Without the healing dances, their lives would be full of contention.     [ edit ]   Other Occurrences at Healing Dances   Also in this powerful state, healers often walk on fire, see the insides of peoples bodies and scenes at great distances from their camp, or travel to Gods home, as observed by Elizabeth Marshall. One healer tells of a time when his spirit left the camp and came upon a pride of lions that had been troubling the people. The mans spirit ordered them away, and they left and didnt bother the people anymore. [ 17 ] These activities would never be attempted in their ordinary state.   Along with healing, these dances andÂ !kia also give the people more sense of self. K""au fDau, a healer that is blind, described becoming more his self, to Professor Katz, like this:     God keeps my eyeballs in a little cloth bag. When he first collected them, he got a little cloth bag and plucked my eyeballs out and put them into the bag and then he tied the eyeballs to his belt and went up to heaven. And now when I dance, on the nights when I dance and the singing rises up, he comes down from heaven swinging the bag with the eyeballs above my head and then he lowers the eyeballs to my eye level, and as the singing gets strong, he puts the eyeballs into my sockets and they stay there and I cure. And then when the women stop singing and separate out, he removes the eyeballs, puts them back in the cloth bag and takes them up to heaven.     So during theÂ !kia state he becomes more than himself because he can then see, both figuratively and literally. [ 18 ]  Healing and this powerful energy are important to the Bushmen so they can identify themselves, and see who they truly are.     [ edit ]   Becoming a Healer   Becoming a healer isnt just for a few religious specialists. According to Thomas Dowson, an independent archaeologist who has held posts at the University of the Witwatersrand and the Universities of Southampton and Manchester, the people would rather have it spread throughout the group. It is a long and painful process to become a healer, but still many go along this path. In fact, by the time the people reach adulthood, about half of the men and a third of the women have become healers. [ 19 ]  Katz also says the motivation and reason they want to become healers even though it is painful is because they can help people. If someone is very sick and almost dead, they can bring them back to life. [ 20 ]  They like the power of being able to help people, influencing and changing their lives.     [ edit ]   Dances Lasting All Night   These happenings go on throughout the entire night. Elizabeth Marshall says, people will get tired, but they will not stop, because it is important to keep going until sunrise. Sometimes the younger people will endure no longer and might leave the dance circle, but the older people never falter. When the first light of dawn shows on the horizon they gather extra energy; they will sing louder and dance faster. As the sun rises the dance reaches a final most powerful intensity, and then will suddenly stop. [ 21 ]  Sandy Gall, author of the book The Bushmen of Southern Africa, states that after a healing dance they collapse in exhaustion until the next day, when, fully recovered, they share their trance experiences with one another. [ 22 ]   Elizabeth Marshall informs that, the reason these dances are held all through the night is because of tradition started long ago. It is a known fact that at sunrise and sunset, when the warm air and cool air of night pass each other sound carries the best. It has to do with the density of the two kinds of air; sound travels the best in dense cool air. Back when the first Bushmen lived, the land was empty and quiet, and very few things made loud noises in the Kalahari Desert. So in the dry cool air the sound of people holding a trance dance could be heard almost twenty miles. This sound could have been a notice to others far away that a large number of people was somewhere nearby. So the people wanted to continue their trance dances until dawn, when the sound travels the farthest. [ 23 ]     [ edit ]   Rock Paintings and Engravings   Gall says, the Bushmen paintings and engravings date back to thousands of years ago. They are found all over the southern half of Africa in caves and overhangs. He says, There are extraordinary still very vivid pictures of animals, hunters and half-human half-animal hybrids. The half-human hybrids are believed to be the medicine men or healers. [ 24 ]  Their depictions of these medicine men, give us evidence that they did do the healing dances.   Gall says, The Laurens van der Post panel at Tsodilo is one of the most famous rock paintings. High on this rock face in Botswana is the image of a magnificent red eland bull painted, according to Van der Post, only as a Bushman who had a deep identification with the eland could have painted him. Also on this rock face is a female giraffe that is motionless like it is alarmed by a predator. Several other images of animals are on it also, along with the flesh blood-red handprints that are the signature of the unknown artist. [ 25 ]   [ 26 ]     [ edit ]   Learning From Rock Art   The Rock art isnt just mere paintings that the Bushmen painted for fun. We can actually learn a lot about them through examining it. According to Dowson, a lot of rock art is actually in symbols and metaphors. For example, eland bulls, meant marriage, and curing or the trance dance. Rock art gives us a glimpse of the Bushmens history, and how they lived their lives.  [ 27 ]   Bushmen also used rock art to record things that happened in their lives. Several instances of rock art have been found that resemble wagons and colonists. Dowson notes that, The people who brought in the wagons and so forth thus became, whether they realized it or not, part of the social production of southern African rock art. They added a new dimension. [ 28 ]  D.P. Bleek, writer of the article Beliefs and Customs of the Ixam Bushmen, published 1933, says the Bushmen also recorded rain dance animals. When they did rain dances they would go into a trance to capture one of these animals. In their trance they would kill it, and its blood and milk became the rain. [ 29 ]  As depicted in the rock art, the rain dance animals they saw usually resembled a hippopotamus or antelope, and were sometimes surrounded by fish according to Dowson. [ 30 ]   We can also learn more about how the Bushmen lived through their rock art. In the following depiction, the people are all in a dancing stance, and the women are all clapping. So, according to Dowson, it is believed to be one of their healing or trance dances. Everyone is the same; one is not more elaborate or more detailed than another. This shows that though the healers held special powers, they were not thought of as higher or better. Healing was not for becoming a more prominent and powerful person, it was for the good of the entire community. [ 31 ]   [ 32 ]   H. C. Woodhouse, author of the book Archaeology in Southern Africa, says historical sources have also said that Bushmen often disguised themselves as animals so they could get close enough to grazing herds to shoot them. The head of the buck was an important part of this disguise, and was also used in dancing and miming of the actions of animals. The large number of buckheaded figures in paintings is proof that the Bushmen did this. [ 33 ]     [ edit ]   Production of Rock Art   Woodhouse also says Bushmen used different colored stone to do the drawings. He says, They usually used red rock, which they ground until it was fine, and then mixed it with fat. They then rubbed this on the rock to form the pictures. This paint that they used withstands the rain and weather for very long periods of time. [ 34 ]  The Bushmen then, according to Phillip V. Tobias, an Honorary Professor of Palaeoanthropology at the Bernard Price Institute for Palaeontological Research, used this paint in four different styles. These four style techniques are monochromes, animal outlines in thick red lines, thinly outlined figures, and white stylized figures. [ 35 ]  A.R. Willcox, writer of the article Australian and South African Rock-Art Compared, published 1959, says the tool they used to do these paintings was a brush made from animals hair or a single small feather. This may be one reason for the great fineness and delicacy of their painting. [ 36 ]  I. and J. Rudner, writers of the journal Who Were the Artists? Archaeological Notes from South West Africa, published 1959, say the form that the Bushmen use is often referred to as a Dynamic School. It has a lot of action and color, and reached its climax in the shaded eland pictures. It is usually associated with the Bushmen. [ 37 ]   According to Woodhouse, clues are given as to whom worked on the rock art by the subjects that are chosen. There are many pictures of the Eland, Reybuck, Hartebeest and Lion, and also of Bushmen and Kafirs fighting. [ 38 ]  However, there are few depictions of plants. Wilcox notes that, plants usually fell in the domain of women, so it is presumed that the authors of these paintings were men. [ 39 ]     [ edit ]   References       ^  Rupert Isaacson.

Melissa Petrie, 4th grade, PS 132   My heart is like a singing bird  It is chirping in my body  As long as I don't let it go  It would be warm in my body  It's ok if there's a bird in me  As long as you don't break my heart  You won't break the bird in me.

The Secret Garden was what Mary called it when she was thinking of it. She liked the name, and she liked still more the feeling that when its beautiful old walls shut her in no one knew where she was. It seemed almost like being shut out of the world in some fairy place. The few books she had read and liked had been fairy-story books, and she had read of secret gardens in some of the stories. Sometimes people went to sleep in them for a hundred years, which she had thought must be rather stupid. She had no intention of going to sleep, and, in fact, she was becoming wider awake every day which passed at Misselthwaite. She was beginning to like to be out of doors; she no longer hated the wind, but enjoyed it. She could run faster, and longer, and she could skip up to a hundred. The bulbs in the secret garden must have been much astonished. Such nice clear places were made round them that they had all the breathing space they wanted, and really, if Mistress Mary had known it, they began to cheer up under the dark earth and work tremendously. The sun could get at them and warm them, and when the rain came down it could reach them at once, so they began to feel very much alive. Mary was an odd, determined little person, and now she had something interesting to be determined about, she was very much absorbed, indeed. She worked and dug and pulled up weeds steadily, only becoming more pleased with her work every hour instead of tiring of it. It seemed to her like a fascinating sort of play. She found many more of the sprouting pale green points than she had ever hoped to find. They seemed to be starting up everywhere and each day she was sure she found tiny new ones, some so tiny that they barely peeped above the earth. There were so many that she remembered what Martha had said about the ""snowdrops by the thousands,"" and about bulbs spreading and making new ones. These had been left to themselves for ten years and perhaps they had spread, like the snowdrops, into thousands. She wondered how long it would be before they showed that they were flowers. Sometimes she stopped digging to look at the garden and try to imagine what it would be like when it was covered with thousands of lovely things in bloom. During that week of sunshine, she became more intimate with Ben Weatherstaff. She surprised him several times by seeming to start up beside him as if she sprang out of the earth. The truth was that she was afraid that he would pick up his tools and go away if he saw her coming, so she always walked toward him as silently as possible. But, in fact, he did not object to her as strongly as he had at first. Perhaps he was secretly rather flattered by her evident desire for his elderly company. Then, also, she was more civil than she had been. He did not know that when she first saw him she spoke to him as she would have spoken to a native, and had not known that a cross, sturdy old Yorkshire man was not accustomed to salaam to his masters, and be merely commanded by them to do things. ""Tha'rt like th' robin,"" he said to her one morning when he lifted his head and saw her standing by him. ""I never knows when I shall see thee or which side tha'll come from."" ""He's friends with me now,"" said Mary. ""That's like him,"" snapped Ben Weatherstaff. ""Makin' up to th' women folk just for vanity an' flightiness. There's nothin' he wouldn't do for th' sake o' showin' off an' flirtin' his tail-feathers. He's as full o' pride as an egg's full o' meat."" He very seldom talked much and sometimes did not even answer Mary's questions except by a grunt, but this morning he said more than usual. He stood up and rested one hobnailed boot on the top of his spade while he looked her over. ""How long has tha' been here?"" he jerked out. ""I think it's about a month,"" she answered. ""Tha's beginnin' to do Misselthwaite credit,"" he said. ""Tha's a bit fatter than tha' was an' tha's not quite so yeller. Tha' looked like a young plucked crow when tha' first came into this garden. Thinks I to myself I never set eyes on an uglier, sourer faced young 'un."" Mary was not vain and as she had never thought much of her looks she was not greatly disturbed. ""I know I'm fatter,"" she said. ""My stockings are getting tighter. They used to make wrinkles. There's the robin, Ben Weatherstaff."" There, indeed, was the robin, and she thought he looked nicer than ever. His red waistcoat was as glossy as satin and he flirted his wings and tail and tilted his head and hopped about with all sorts of lively graces. He seemed determined to make Ben Weatherstaff admire him. But Ben was sarcastic. ""Aye, there tha' art!"" he said. ""Tha' can put up with me for a bit sometimes when tha's got no one better. Tha's been reddenin' up thy waistcoat an' polishin' thy feathers this two weeks. I know what tha's up to. Tha's courtin' some bold young madam somewhere tellin' thy lies to her about bein' th' finest cock robin on Missel Moor an' ready to fight all th' rest of 'em."" ""Oh! look at him!"" exclaimed Mary. The robin was evidently in a fascinating, bold mood. He hopped closer and closer and looked at Ben Weatherstaff more and more engagingly. He flew on to the nearest currant bush and tilted his head and sang a little song right at him. ""Tha' thinks tha'll get over me by doin' that,"" said Ben, wrinkling his face up in such a way that Mary felt sure he was trying not to look pleased. ""Tha' thinks no one can stand out against thee--that's what tha' thinks."" The robin spread his wings--Mary could scarcely believe her eyes. He flew right up to the handle of Ben Weatherstaff's spade and alighted on the top of it. Then the old man's face wrinkled itself slowly into a new expression. He stood still as if he were afraid to breathe--as if he would not have stirred for the world, lest his robin should start away. He spoke quite in a whisper. ""Well, I'm danged!"" he said as softly as if he were saying something quite different. ""Tha' does know how to get at a chap--tha' does! Tha's fair unearthly, tha's so knowin'."" And he stood without stirring--almost without drawing his breath--until the robin gave another flirt to his wings and flew away. Then he stood looking at the handle of the spade as if there might be Magic in it, and then he began to dig again and said nothing for several minutes. But because he kept breaking into a slow grin now and then, Mary was not afraid to talk to him. ""Have you a garden of your own?"" she asked. ""No. I'm bachelder an' lodge with Martin at th' gate."" ""If you had one,"" said Mary, ""what would you plant?"" ""Cabbages an' 'taters an' onions."" ""But if you wanted to make a flower garden,"" persisted Mary, ""what would you plant?"" ""Bulbs an' sweet-smellin' things--but mostly roses."" Mary's face lighted up. ""Do you like roses?"" she said. Ben Weatherstaff rooted up a weed and threw it aside before he answered. ""Well, yes, I do. I was learned that by a young lady I was gardener to. She had a lot in a place she was fond of, an' she loved 'em like they was children--or robins. I've seen her bend over an' kiss 'em."" He dragged out another weed and scowled at it. ""That were as much as ten year' ago."" ""Where is she now?"" asked Mary, much interested. ""Heaven,"" he answered, and drove his spade deep into the soil, ""'cording to what parson says."" ""What happened to the roses?"" Mary asked again, more interested than ever. ""They was left to themselves."" Mary was becoming quite excited. ""Did they quite die? Do roses quite die when they are left to themselves?"" she ventured. ""Well, I'd got to like 'em--an' I liked her--an' she liked 'em,"" Ben Weatherstaff admitted reluctantly. ""Once or twice a year I'd go an' work at 'em a bit--prune 'em an' dig about th' roots. They run wild, but they was in rich soil, so some of 'em lived."" ""When they have no leaves and look gray and brown and dry, how can you tell whether they are dead or alive?"" inquired Mary. ""Wait till th' spring gets at 'em--wait till th' sun shines on th' rain and th' rain falls on th' sunshine an' then tha'll find out."" ""How--how?"" cried Mary, forgetting to be careful. ""Look along th' twigs an' branches an' if tha' see a bit of a brown lump swelling here an' there, watch it after th' warm rain an' see what happens."" He stopped suddenly and looked curiously at her eager face. ""Why does tha' care so much about roses an' such, all of a sudden?"" he demanded. Mistress Mary felt her face grow red. She was almost afraid to answer. ""I--I want to play that--that I have a garden of my own,"" she stammered. ""I--there is nothing for me to do. I have nothing--and no one."" ""Well,"" said Ben Weatherstaff slowly, as he watched her, ""that's true. Tha' hasn't."" He said it in such an odd way that Mary wondered if he was actually a little sorry for her. She had never felt sorry for herself; she had only felt tired and cross, because she disliked people and things so much. But now the world seemed to be changing and getting nicer. If no one found out about the secret garden, she should enjoy herself always. She stayed with him for ten or fifteen minutes longer and asked him as many questions as she dared. He answered every one of them in his queer grunting way and he did not seem really cross and did not pick up his spade and leave her. He said something about roses just as she was going away and it reminded her of the ones he had said he had been fond of. ""Do you go and see those other roses now?"" she asked. ""Not been this year. My rheumatics has made me too stiff in th' joints."" He said it in his grumbling voice, and then quite suddenly he seemed to get angry with her, though she did not see why he should. ""Now look here!"" he said sharply. ""Don't tha' ask so many questions. Tha'rt th' worst wench for askin' questions I've ever come a cross. Get thee gone an' play thee. I've done talkin' for today."" And he said it so crossly that she knew there was not the least use in staying another minute. She went skipping slowly down the outside walk, thinking him over and saying to herself that, queer as it was, here was another person whom she liked in spite of his crossness. She liked old Ben Weatherstaff. Yes, she did like him. She always wanted to try to make him talk to her. Also she began to believe that he knew everything in the world about flowers. There was a laurel-hedged walk which curved round the secret garden and ended at a gate which opened into a wood, in the park. She thought she would slip round this walk and look into the wood and see if there were any rabbits hopping about. She enjoyed the skipping very much and when she reached the little gate she opened it and went through because she heard a low, peculiar whistling sound and wanted to find out what it was. It was a very strange thing indeed. She quite caught her breath as she stopped to look at it. A boy was sitting under a tree, with his back against it, playing on a rough wooden pipe. He was a funny looking boy about twelve. He looked very clean and his nose turned up and his cheeks were as red as poppies and never had Mistress Mary seen such round and such blue eyes in any boy's face. And on the trunk of the tree he leaned against, a brown squirrel was clinging and watching him, and from behind a bush nearby a cock pheasant was delicately stretching his neck to peep out, and quite near him were two rabbits sitting up and sniffing with tremulous noses--and actually it appeared as if they were all drawing near to watch him and listen to the strange low little call his pipe seemed to make. When he saw Mary he held up his hand and spoke to her in a voice almost as low as and rather like his piping. ""Don't tha' move,"" he said. ""It'd flight 'em."" Mary remained motionless. He stopped playing his pipe and began to rise from the ground. He moved so slowly that it scarcely seemed as though he were moving at all, but at last he stood on his feet and then the squirrel scampered back up into the branches of his tree, the pheasant withdrew his head and the rabbits dropped on all fours and began to hop away, though not at all as if they were frightened. ""I'm Dickon,"" the boy said. ""I know tha'rt Miss Mary."" Then Mary realized that somehow she had known at first that he was Dickon. Who else could have been charming rabbits and pheasants as the natives charm snakes in India? He had a wide, red, curving mouth and his smile spread all over his face. ""I got up slow,"" he explained, ""because if tha' makes a quick move it startles 'em. A body 'as to move gentle an' speak low when wild things is about."" He did not speak to her as if they had never seen each other before but as if he knew her quite well. Mary knew nothing about boys and she spoke to him a little stiffly because she felt rather shy. ""Did you get Martha's letter?"" she asked. He nodded his curly, rust-colored head. ""That's why I come."" He stooped to pick up something which had been lying on the ground beside him when he piped. ""I've got th' garden tools. There's a little spade an' rake an' a fork an' hoe. Eh! they are good 'uns. There's a trowel, too. An' th' woman in th' shop threw in a packet o' white poppy an' one o' blue larkspur when I bought th' other seeds."" ""Will you show the seeds to me?"" Mary said. She wished she could talk as he did. His speech was so quick and easy. It sounded as if he liked her and was not the least afraid she would not like him, though he was only a common moor boy, in patched clothes and with a funny face and a rough, rusty-red head. As she came closer to him she noticed that there was a clean fresh scent of heather and grass and leaves about him, almost as if he were made of them. She liked it very much and when she looked into his funny face with the red cheeks and round blue eyes she forgot that she had felt shy. ""Let us sit down on this log and look at them,"" she said. They sat down and he took a clumsy little brown paper package out of his coat pocket. He untied the string and inside there were ever so many neater and smaller packages with a picture of a flower on each one. ""There's a lot o' mignonette an' poppies,"" he said. ""Mignonette's th' sweetest smellin' thing as grows, an' it'll grow wherever you cast it, same as poppies will. Them as'll come up an' bloom if you just whistle to 'em, them's th' nicest of all."" He stopped and turned his head quickly, his poppy-cheeked face lighting up. ""Where's that robin as is callin' us?"" he said. The chirp came from a thick holly bush, bright with scarlet berries, and Mary thought she knew whose it was. ""Is it really calling us?"" she asked. ""Aye,"" said Dickon, as if it was the most natural thing in the world, ""he's callin' some one he's friends with. That's same as sayin' 'Here I am. Look at me. I wants a bit of a chat.' There he is in the bush. Whose is he?"" ""He's Ben Weatherstaff's, but I think he knows me a little,"" answered Mary. ""Aye, he knows thee,"" said Dickon in his low voice again. ""An' he likes thee. He's took thee on. He'll tell me all about thee in a minute."" He moved quite close to the bush with the slow movement Mary had noticed before, and then he made a sound almost like the robin's own twitter. The robin listened a few seconds, intently, and then answered quite as if he were replying to a question. ""Aye, he's a friend o' yours,"" chuckled Dickon. ""Do you think he is?"" cried Mary eagerly. She did so want to know. ""Do you think he really likes me?"" ""He wouldn't come near thee if he didn't,"" answered Dickon. ""Birds is rare choosers an' a robin can flout a body worse than a man. See, he's making up to thee now. 'Cannot tha' see a chap?' he's sayin'."" And it really seemed as if it must be true. He so sidled and twittered and tilted as he hopped on his bush. ""Do you understand everything birds say?"" said Mary. Dickon's grin spread until he seemed all wide, red, curving mouth, and he rubbed his rough head. ""I think I do, and they think I do,"" he said. ""I've lived on th' moor with 'em so long. I've watched 'em break shell an' come out an' fledge an' learn to fly an' begin to sing, till I think I'm one of 'em. Sometimes I think p'raps I'm a bird, or a fox, or a rabbit, or a squirrel, or even a beetle, an' I don't know it."" He laughed and came back to the log and began to talk about the flower seeds again. He told her what they looked like when they were flowers; he told her how to plant them, and watch them, and feed and water them. ""See here,"" he said suddenly, turning round to look at her. ""I'll plant them for thee myself. Where is tha' garden?"" Mary's thin hands clutched each other as they lay on her lap. She did not know what to say, so for a whole minute she said nothing. She had never thought of this. She felt miserable. And she felt as if she went red and then pale. ""Tha's got a bit o' garden, hasn't tha'?"" Dickon said. It was true that she had turned red and then pale. Dickon saw her do it, and as she still said nothing, he began to be puzzled. ""Wouldn't they give thee a bit?"" he asked. ""Hasn't tha' got any yet?"" She held her hands tighter and turned her eyes toward him. ""I don't know anything about boys,"" she said slowly. ""Could you keep a secret, if I told you one? It's a great secret. I don't know what I should do if any one found it out. I believe I should die!"" She said the last sentence quite fiercely. Dickon looked more puzzled than ever and even rubbed his hand over his rough head again, but he answered quite good-humoredly. ""I'm keepin' secrets all th' time,"" he said. ""If I couldn't keep secrets from th' other lads, secrets about foxes' cubs, an' birds' nests, an' wild things' holes, there'd be naught safe on th' moor. Aye, I can keep secrets."" Mistress Mary did not mean to put out her hand and clutch his sleeve but she did it. ""I've stolen a garden,"" she said very fast. ""It isn't mine. It isn't anybody's. Nobody wants it, nobody cares for it, nobody ever goes into it. Perhaps everything is dead in it already. I don't know."" She began to feel hot and as contrary as she had ever felt in her life. ""I don't care, I don't care! Nobody has any right to take it from me when I care about it and they don't. They're letting it die, all shut in by itself,"" she ended passionately, and she threw her arms over her face and burst out crying-poor little Mistress Mary. Dickon's curious blue eyes grew rounder and rounder. ""Eh-h-h!"" he said, drawing his exclamation out slowly, and the way he did it meant both wonder and sympathy. ""I've nothing to do,"" said Mary. ""Nothing belongs to me. I found it myself and I got into it myself. I was only just like the robin, and they wouldn't take it from the robin."" ""Where is it?"" asked Dickon in a dropped voice. Mistress Mary got up from the log at once. She knew she felt contrary again, and obstinate, and she did not care at all. She was imperious and Indian, and at the same time hot and sorrowful. ""Come with me and I'll show you,"" she said. She led him round the laurel path and to the walk where the ivy grew so thickly. Dickon followed her with a queer, almost pitying, look on his face. He felt as if he were being led to look at some strange bird's nest and must move softly. When she stepped to the wall and lifted the hanging ivy he started. There was a door and Mary pushed it slowly open and they passed in together, and then Mary stood and waved her hand round defiantly. ""It's this,"" she said. ""It's a secret garden, and I'm the only one in the world who wants it to be alive."" Dickon looked round and round about it, and round and round again. ""Eh!"" he almost whispered, ""it is a queer, pretty place! It's like as if a body was in a dream.""

When he fled from her, traveling to  Earth-616  where he knew he had an identical looking counterpart,  Earth-616 's  Captain Britain , she sent armored troops to retrieve him. They mistakenly attacked Captain Britain twice, but were repelled on each occasion, the first time by Britain and his ally  Meggan , the second by Britain's sister  Betsy . Sat-Yr-9 next hired the interdimensional mercenary group, the  Technet , but Briton swapped places with Britain, and the Technet took the wrong man back to Earth-794. Britain later convinced the Technet of their error, but Sat-Yr-9 tried to stop them departing with him; the Technet slaughtered her soldiers, and the already psychotic Sat-Yr-9 became completely unhinged. After they departed, she started slaughtering her subjects, leading  Roma  to send  Captain UK  on a mission to overthrow and imprison her.   While Britain was on Earth-794, Briton was killed by Betsy when he tried to rape her.     [ edit ]   Courtney Ross          Sat-Yr-9 kills Courtney Ross to take her place. Art by  Alan Davis .       Escaping to Earth-616 through a dimension gateway that had been opened by  Widget  for an unassuming civilian on Earth-616, Sat-Yr-9 killed her alternate reality counterpart, a businesswoman named  Courtney Ross , and took her place. An example of interdimensional similarities, Ross was Captain Britain's ex-girlfriend. As Ross, she tried to create a rift between Captain Britain and his current girlfriend  Meggan .   Sat-Yr-9 also knew about  Jamie Braddock 's reality warping powers before anyone else including himself did (since she knew about the reality warping powers of Jamie's alternate reality counterpart in her timeline of origin), hiring the Technet through a proxy, Nigel Frobisher, to rescue the imprisoned Earth-616 Jamie, intending to use his great powers as a living weapon against difficult adversaries.   She used Jamie's powers to change Frobisher into a duplicate of the London Crime  Vixen , while changing Vixen herself into a fox. With Frobisher as Vixen, Sat-Yr-9 took over the Vixen's crime syndicate.   With her powerbase built, she attacked  Excalibur , revealing her true identity to them. She tried to enslave Captain Britain, against Frobisher's advice. Frobisher rebelled and was killed by her. Excalibur managed to defeat Jamie, and Sat-Yr-9 and her troops were forced to flee. Captain Britain swore to avenge Courtney's death, but was unable to track Sat-Yr-9 down.     [ edit ]   Hellfire Club   After the events of House of M, Sat-Yr-9 appeared once again under the alias of ""Courtney Ross"", she has joined the  Hellfire Club  as its White Queen, with  Viper , a former HYDRA assassin, as her self-proclaimed ""White Princess"" and bodyguard. She has been seen publicly appearing as Courtney Ross again, trying to convince Captain Britain that she somehow is the real Courtney Ross. So far Captain Britain remains unconvinced, but hasn't moved against her.     [ edit ]   Notes     Along with Courtney Ross, Sat-Yr-9 has another alternate reality counterpart;  Saturnyne , the Omniversal Majestrix of  Otherworld  and a servant of Roma.   An alternate version of Sat-Yr-9 appears in  Paradise X : Heralds , where she displays the power to control men through pheromones. The regular Sat-Yr-9 never displayed this ability. This version is called Saturnyne, despite her appearance being that of Sat-Yr-9.   Sat-Yr-9 can be distinguished visually from her alternate reality counterparts by a  tattoo  of her stylized knife emblem on her right thigh.

She is one of  Nancy Drew 's best friends, along with  George Fayne , who is Bess' cousin. Bess and George are introduced to readers in  The Secret at Shadow Ranch . Bess is described as blond, slightly plump, pretty, and blue eyed. She is very feminine, and is easily frightened when involved in Nancy's adventures. Bess always fears the worst is going to happen and insists that Nancy gives up several mysteries. She is somewhat flighty, fickle, and a bit of a flirt - quite the opposite of cousin George, who is more practical, steady, and very much a tomboy.   Bess loves to shop, and has a weakness for food. In most volumes in the series, George makes at least one comment on Bess' diet. Bess, admittedly, cannot stick to a diet, no matter how she tries.   Her boyfriend is Emerson College student  Dave Evans . She is introduced to him in  The Secret at Shadow Ranch . Bess is a true romantic. She is loyal, and she always enjoys helping Nancy, albeit with some trepidation. Although George considers her a coward, Bess does sometimes surprise even herself with her bravery, and she occasionally deciphers clues that stump even Nancy!   In the Nancy Drew movie of 2007, Bess was played by  Amy Bruckner .   In the television series  The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries  (1977-1979), Bess was played by Ruth Cox.                 v Â   Â  d Â   Â  e     Nancy Drew                       Â    The Series' and Novels             Nancy Drew Mystery Stories             1930s       The Secret of the Old Clock  (1930) Â    The Hidden Staircase  (1930) Â    The Bungalow Mystery  ((1930) Â    The Mystery at Lilac Inn  (1931) Â    The Secret at Shadow Ranch  (1931) Â    The Secret of Red Gate Farm  (1931) Â    The Clue in the Diary  (1932) Â    Nancy's Mysterious Letter  (1932) Â    The Sign of the Twisted Candles  (1933) Â    The Password to Larkspur Lane  (1933) Â    The Clue of the Broken Locket  (1934) Â    The Message in the Hollow Oak  (1935) Â    The Mystery of the Ivory Charm  (1936) Â    The Whispering Statue  (1937) Â    The Haunted Bridge  (1937) Â    The Clue of the Tapping Heels  (1939)                 1940s       The Mystery of the Brass-Bound Trunk  (1940) Â    The Mystery at the Moss-Covered Mansion  (1941) Â    The Quest of the Missing Map  (1942) Â    The Clue in the Jewel Box  (1943) Â    The Secret in the Old Attic  (1944) Â    The Clue in the Crumbling Wall  (1945) Â    The Mystery of the Tolling Bell  (1946) Â    The Clue in the Old Album  (1947) Â    The Ghost of Blackwood Hall  (1948) Â    The Clue of the Leaning Chimney  (1949)                 1950s       The Secret of the Wooden Lady  (1950) Â    The Clue of the Black Keys  (1951) Â    The Mystery at the Ski Jump  (1952) Â    The Clue of the Velvet Mask  (1953) Â    The Ringmaster's Secret  (1953) Â    The Scarlet Slipper Mystery  (1954) Â    The Witch Tree Symbol  (1955) Â    The Hidden Window Mystery  (1956) Â    The Haunted Showboat  (1957) Â    The Secret of the Golden Pavilion  (1959)                 1960s       The Clue in the Old Stagecoach  (1960) Â    The Mystery of the Fire Dragon  (1961) Â    The Clue of the Dancing Puppet  (1962) Â    The Moonstone Castle Mystery  (1963) Â    The Clue of the Whistling Bagpipes  (1964) Â    The Phantom of Pine Hill  (1965) Â    The Mystery of the 99 Steps  (1966) Â    The Clue in the Crossword Cipher  (1967) Â    The Spider Sapphire Mystery  (1968) Â    The Invisible Intruder  (1969)                 1970s       The Mysterious Mannequin  (1970) Â    The Crooked Banister  (1971) Â    The Secret of Mirror Bay  (1972) Â    The Double Jinx Mystery  (1973) Â    Mystery of the Glowing Eye  (1974) Â    The Secret of the Forgotten City  (1975) Â    The Sky Phantom  (1976) Â    The Strange Message in the Parchment  (1977) Â    Mystery of Crocodile Island  (1978) Â    The Thirteenth Pearl  (1979) Â    The Triple Hoax  (1979)                 1980s       The Flying Saucer Mystery  (1980) Â    The Secret in the Old Lace  (1980) Â    The Greek Symbol Mystery  (1980) Â    The Swami's Ring  (1981) Â    The Kachina Doll Mystery  (1981) Â    The Twin Dilemma  (1981) Â    Captive Witness  (1981) Â    Race Against Time  (1982) Â    The Case of the Rising Stars  (1988)                 1990s       The Treasure in the Royal Tower  (1995) Â    The Wedding Day Mystery  (1997) Â   The E-mail Mystery  (1998)                 2000s       Werewolf in a Winter Wonderland  (2003)                     The Nancy Drew Files     Secrets Can Kill , etc.               The Nancy Drew Notebooks ,   Nancy Drew and the Clue Crew     The Slumber Party Secret , etc.   Sleepover Sleuths , etc.               Nancy Drew On Campus     New Lives, New Loves , etc.               Nancy Drew  (All New)  Girl Detective ,  Papercutz' Girl Detective graphic novels     Without a Trace Â    A Race Against Time , etc.   Where's Nancy?

Please  help rewrite it  to  explain the fiction more clearly and provide non-fictional perspective .       The  Titans  are a group of fictional characters in the  Legends of Dune  series of novels, written by  Brian Herbert  and  Kevin J. Anderson  and set in the  Dune  universe  created by  Frank Herbert . The twenty Titans took over the  Old Empire  and ruled it for a century before subcumbing to the machines led by the artificial intelligence  Omnius . After a millennium, both the machines and the remaining Titans perished during the  Butlerian Jihad . The Titans most notably include  Agamemnon ,  Ajax ,  Barbarossa ,  Dante ,  Hecate ,  Juno ,  Tlaloc  and  Xerxes . Of the remaining twelve Titans, only Alexander and Tamerlane are explicitly named.           Contents       1   Overview   2   Individual Titans     2.1   Agamemnon   2.2   Ajax   2.3   Barbarossa   2.4   Dante   2.5   Hecate   2.6   Juno   2.7   Tlaloc   2.8   Xerxes                   [ edit ]   Overview   A small band of dissident humans born a thousand years before  Serena Butler , these twenty individuals had grown disgusted with the decadence of their society, and humanity as a whole. With  thinking machines  to handle even the most mundane tasks, mankind had grown fat and lazy, and those who would become the Titans saw in this the chance for change  the machines were an invasion army already deployed and in place. The Titans adopted the names of prominent figures in history and, utilizing the programming talents of Barbarossa, they directed the machines to rise up and seize humanity and installed themselves as dictators for life. Eventually the group separated to each rule their own worlds in the galaxy, utilizing the thinking machines that had originally brought them to power as the means to control entire planets.   After their leader, Tlaloc, was killed in a freak accident about ten years into their reign, the Titans came to the realization that not only were their human bodies fragile but their lifespans were limited; thus, they soon sought new ways in which to continue their rule. Juno was the one to discover a way to achieve this after speaking with the  Cogitor Eklo , a disembodied brain in a canister with a perpetually living and aware consciousness. Agamemnon was the first to attempt this transition into what would be called  cymeks ; through the use of specialized interfaces, his brain in the canister was installed inside a large walking machine body from which he might continue his rule indefinitely. These fearsome, weaponized bodies would make the Titans virtually unstoppable. Having pushed to the very farthest limits of  artificial intelligence , their machines ran their empire for them almost completely, allowing the Titans leave to enjoy all the luxuries they desired (the nature of which are left to the reader's imagination, although it is revealed that the Titans were able to have some type of sexual activity, at least with other cymeks).   Their rule carried on in this form for a century and was known as the Time of the Titans. A handful of human worlds on the fringes of known space remained independent, and several hrethgir (slave) rebellions erupted, with Alexander and Tamerlane slain by the rebels, but neither of these threats proved fatal to the Titans' continued rule.   The Time of the Titans would instead come to an end through the same chain of events that had catapulted them into power. Xerxes gave his AI attendant program too much autonomy (that he might work even less), repeating the very mistake that the Titans had despised their fellow humans for. The result was nearly instantaneous; the machines rose up again, this time against Xerxes and under the control of this first fully functional artificial intelligence (humanity itself had been sufficiently cowed under the rule of the Titans and so were spared the brunt of this second machine revolution). Taking the name  Omnius  for itself, this new consciousness overtook the network of all interconnected thinking machines in an instant. It then spread itself outwards, assuming control instantly as it reached each new world before any alarm could be raised, overthrowing the ruling Titans world by world. Fortunately for the Titans, Barbarossa had possessed the foresight to ensure that the machines were incapable of directly harming their now-former rulers, and thus their continued existence was guaranteed.   For over 900 years the Titans lived in perpetual servitude to Omnius, slowly going insane, knowing that their every move was observed everywhere they went except the very darkest reaches of space  the only place where they might plot to overthrow Omnius. Their cruelty in the treatment of humans was unspeakable, both toward the enemies of the Evermind and to those who had already been conquered. In special purpose-built cymek bodies, the Titans were an immensely powerful force on the battlefield and charged at the front of Omnius' thinking machine armies in clashes with the last remaining free human worlds. When not engaged in battle, they commissioned the design and construction of hundreds of colossal monuments to themselves throughout the  Synchronized Worlds , using the humans as slave laborers.   Through the use of preserved reproductive material (frozen sperm) and selective breeding with slave women, the Titan Agamemnon was able to produce offspring; however, his contempt for humans and his incredibly high standards often led to the destruction of said offspring. One of these,  Vorian Atreides , 13th son of Agamemnon, survived to become instrumental in the eventual overthrow of the thinking machines, and also responsible for the death of his father.     [ edit ]   Individual Titans     [ edit ]   Agamemnon   Agamemnon , the head general of the Titans, was born Andrew Skouros on Earth, around 1200 B.G. during the Old Empire. The claimed descendant of the House of  Atreus  and therefore the mythological  Agamemnon , he was seduced by the words of the visionary Tlaloc and became his somewhat more realistic partner. During and after the revolt, Agamemnon served as the Titans' general and overall commander of their armies. When Tlaloc died in an accident a decade after assuming power, Agamemnon was the sole leader of the Titans and ruler of all humanity until his overthrow by  Omnius  a century later. For the next 900 years, Agamemnon plotted to one day retake his empire from the robot evermind. He had had samples of his semen preserved before becoming a cymek, and used them on slave women to try to sire a worthy heir. After killing twelve of his ""unworthy"" sons he had Vorian, who Agamemnon thought had the necessary traits to become his heir. Agamemnon pretended to side with the Evermind Omnius, although aspiring one day to take over mankind and the machines.   After Vorian joined the Army of the Jihad, Agamemnon decided along with the remaining Titans to rebel against Omnius. When Agamemnon was holed up on  Hessra  in 88 B.G., Vorian tricked Agamemnon into trusting him and then pushed him over the ledge of a window to his death.   Agamemnon's wife/lover in both human and cymek form was the Titan Juno.     [ edit ]   Ajax   During the Time of Titans and even before, Ajax was considered the most brutal and ruthless of the 20 Titans, the co-conspirator who brought sheer muscle and bloody-mindedness to their group. He was described by his mate, the Titan Hecate, as a bully who deserved his eventual fate. Ajax's brutality was most notably seen in the  hrethgir  uprisings on Walgis XI, where he spent many decades destroying the entire human population afterwards.   Ajax's lover before the Time of Titans was Hecate, who also underwent the cymek conversion surgery. Later, realizing his brutal, thuggish nature, Hecate abandoned Ajax and the other Titans.   Ajax eventually met his end at the hands of Iblis Ginjo, soon to become Grand Patriarch. The robot Erasmus, as part of a challenge with the Omnius Evermind on Earth to prove that no human could ever be trusted wholly, had dispatched secret messages to selected slave bosses around the planet, suggesting there was an organized movement against the thinking machines. Iblis believed there was a greater human resistance, and so planned the eventual  hrethgir  (derogatory term for humans) revolt on Earth. The catalyst came with the murder of  Manion , son of Serena Butler and  Xavier Harkonnen . Seeing the terrible death of baby Manion, and the distraught Serena daring to attack Erasmus with her bare hands, the humans rose up, and Iblis put his plans into motion.   Concealed behind a large  frieze  depicting the Titans' conquests (ordered built by Ajax himself), Iblis and his loyal slave crews had concealed old-fashioned rocket and other explosive weapons. When Ajax learned of the revolt, he immediately went to work attempting to stamp out the resistance. Iblis fired his concealed rockets, disabling one of the Titan's legs, immobilizing him. Ajax was felled, and swamped by slaves. Despite the slaves being killed in droves, Ajax's brain preservation canister was eventually smashed, and his ancient brain mashed into pulp.     [ edit ]   Barbarossa   Barbarossa , born as Wilhelm Jayther, was largely responsible for the creation of the Omnius program which eventually took control away from the Titans, through no fault of Barbarossa's. He was reputedly a programming genius, and was very meticulous. This helped the Titans after Omnius had taken control, as Barbarossa had the foresight to program Omnius to be incapable of directly killing a Titan. Omnius did, however, frequently challenge the Titans to fight dangerous gladiatorial duels for the chance of reward; this had the possibility of ending in their deaths, but never did.   Barbarossa perished during the liberation of Giedi Prime when he along with his neo-cymeks were obliterated by a mental shock wave unleashed by a Rossak Sorceress named Heoma.     [ edit ]   Dante   Not as aggressive or power-hungry as his compatriots, Dante was a skilled bureaucrat and strategist. After the Titans first seized power, only the impartial Dante enjoyed sufficient trust from the other Titans to arbitrate the division of the spoils, and continued to serve as the Titans' level-headed planner long after Omnius enslaved his former masters. Dante the mild bureaucrat outlived the warriors and schemers who made up the rest of the Titan fraternity, though he too perished at the hands of Vorian Atreides and Quentin Butler.     [ edit ]   Hecate   Hecate was the Titan Ajax's lover, before the revolt that swept them into power. Swayed by Tlaloc's dreams and visions of a better future for humanity, she too underwent the cymek conversion process with her mate. Eventually, having seen the brutality and bloodthirsty nature of Ajax, she realized that she had outgrown the Titans, and left, resigning her worlds and titles, not to be seen again for a thousand years.   Eventually, when the Butlerian Jihad was at its fullest, Hecate returned in a specially-designed, asteroid-shaped ship. She met with her former lover's killer, Grand Patriarch Iblis Ginjo, and pledged her support to the Jihad in fighting her former associates and the computer evermind, Omnius. The Grand Patriarch convinced Hecate to keep her involvement a secret from the League of Nobles at large, as a cymek's help would bring the Jihad and its fanatical following (and Ginjo's power base), crashing down around them.   Hecate performed notable strides forward on behalf of the Jihad, delivering a nuclear warhead deep into the  Synchronized Worlds  on  Bela Tegeuse , wiping out the evermind incarnation there. She also assisted in the retaking of Xerxes' homeworld, Ix. Unfortunately, the League was too enamored with bickering and petty issues, and could not prioritize, meaning these opportunities were blithely wasted. General Agamemnon and the remaining Titans set up Bela Tegeuse as the seat for their new empire having rebelled against Omnius.   Hecate eventually met her end in a tragic misunderstanding. The businessman  Aurelius Venport  and Supreme Sorceress  Zufa Cenva  (his mother-in-law and former lover), were traveling back to the shipyards of  Kolhar , where Norma Cenva was creating the very first spacefolding vessels. They had just finished negotiating a deal with priestess Serena Butler on  Salusa Secundus  that would eventually see the  Spacing Guild  claiming all rights to a universe-wide monopoly of space travel.   They were ambushed by the neo-cymek Beowulf and his legion, who had learned of the  Holtzmann engines  from their spy,  Yorek Thurr . They wished to obtain it for Agamemnon's empire. Just as it looked as though Aurelius and Zufa would have to obliterate the ship, Hecate's asteroid ship arrived, destroying the cymeks and severely damaging Beowulf.   As Hecate attempted to enter Venport's ship, Aurelius and Zufa merely saw a Titan  an enemy  as Ginjo's pact with Hecate was still a closely guarded secret. Hecate entered, announcing herself ""I am the Titan Hecate ..."" This was all Zufa Cenva needed to hear; she unleashed the full fury of her telepathic powers, disintegrating Hecate's brain, her own, and that of Aurelius.     [ edit ]   Juno   Juno  was born Julianna Parhi; she first met her lover Agamemnon on a complex virtual network through tactical simulations and wargames. Julianna saw the thinking machines as an invasion army already in place. During her talks with Cogitor Eklo, she saw the possibility of living as a disembodied brain, not for introspection, but for action. Agamemnon agreed immediately and was the first to undergo the cymek process. Juno and her lover spent a last sexual night before his surgery. Juno watched the surgery in joy, and a week later Agamemnon returned the favor by watching her surgery.   Juno was finally killed by the primero  Quentin Butler , the father of  Faykan Corrino  and  Abulurd Harkonnen .     [ edit ]   Tlaloc   Tlaloc was a young visionary, originally from the planet Tlulaxa. He abhorred the hedonistic, dull lives that humanity had created for itself and was determined to rescue his species from stagnation. His ideas and principles attracted young Andrew Skouros, Julianna Parhi and Wilhelm Jayther, amongst others. The group spoke and dreamed on network chats, using their screen names, Agamemnon, Juno, Barbarossa. Eventually Barbarossa was able to reprogram the Old Empire's thinking machines to rise up and conquer their masters. Tlaloc was described by his co-conspirator Agamemnon as being somewhat naive and unaware of the practical repercussions of some of his plans, but the Titan general managed to keep him from making any serious mistakes. The two ruled the Old Empire for a decade until an accident slew Tlaloc. Ironically, Agamemnon's and later Omnius' leadership led to much the same stagnation for the conquered humans that Tlaloc had been so determined to erase. It would fall to the fringe worlds that had defied Tlaloc in life to liberate humanity a millennium after his death.     [ edit ]   Xerxes   As a human,  Xerxes  had come from an incredibly wealthy family of the Old Empire, and so was the main financier of the Titan's initial uprising. The Prince of  Rodale IX  (later to be known as Ix), Xerxes eventually strangled his father, making himself sole heir to the family fortune (and his only reason for being part of the Titans' conspiracy in the first place). Xerxes was relatively incompetent compared to the other Titans, and was often barely tolerated, particularly by Agamemnon.   In the Time of the Titans, Xerxes was the last of his kind to undergo conversion into a cymek. He was responsible for the eventual downfall of their hundred year regime, allowing his computerized attendant too much control over the systems of his decadent palace. The attendant, which came to call itself Omnius, took over the Titans' empire as a direct result of Xerxes' action.   Xerxes served as a regent and general in service of Omnius' Synchronized empire. In space combat he utilized a massive robotic body that resembled an enormous and heavily armed spacegoing bird of prey. He eventually met his downfall when, during the brutal torture of  Norma Cenva , he inadvertently awakened her latent psychic abilities. She then obliterated his brain and those of several of his lesser cymeks with a powerful psychic shockwave.                 v Â   Â  d Â   Â  e     Dune  universe             Great Houses     House Atreides  Â Â   House Corrino  Â Â   House Harkonnen  Â Â   House Ordos  (non-canon) Â Â   House Richese  Â Â   House Vernius               Organizations     Bene Gesserit  Â Â   Bene Tleilax  Â Â   Face Dancers  Â Â   Fish Speakers  Â Â   Fremen  Â Â   Honored Matres  Â Â   Landsraad  Â Â   Mentats  Â Â   Padishah Emperors  Â Â   Sardaukar  Â Â   Spacing Guild  Â Â   Suk School  Â Â   Swordmasters of the Ginaz  Â Â   Thinking machines  Â Â   Titans               Characters     Original series:  Alia  Â Â   Chani  Â Â   Daniel and Marty  Â Â   De Vries  Â Â   Duncan  Â Â   Farad'n  Â Â   Fenring  Â Â   Feyd  Â Â   Ghanima  Â Â   Gurney  Â Â   Baron Harkonnen  Â Â   Hawat  Â Â   Irulan  Â Â   Jessica  Â Â   Korba  Â Â   Leto I  Â Â   Leto II  Â Â   Liet-Kynes  Â Â   Lucilla  Â Â   Margot  Â Â   Miles  Â Â   Mohiam  Â Â   Murbella  Â Â   Odrade  Â Â   Paul  Â Â   Rabban  Â Â   Ramallo  Â Â   Scytale  Â Â   Shaddam  Â Â   Sheeana  Â Â   Stilgar  Â Â   Waff  Â Â   Wensicia  Â Â   Yueh  Â Â   Other Bene Gesserit  Â Â   Other Fremen  Prequels/Sequels:  Abulurd  Â Â   Anirul  Â Â   Erasmus  Â Â   Ginjo  Â Â   Norma  Â Â   Omnius  Â Â   Pardot  Â Â   Serena  Â Â   Seurat  Â Â   Vorian  Â Â   Xavier               Key planets     Arrakis  Â Â   Caladan  Â Â   Giedi Prime  Â Â   Ix  Â Â   Kaitain  Â Â   Salusa Secundus  Â Â   Wallach IX               Elements/Concepts     Abomination  Â Â   Butlerian Jihad  Â Â   CHOAM  Â Â   Golden Path  Â Â   Kwisatz Haderach  Â Â   Languages  Â Â   Melange  Â Â   Old Empire  Â Â   Reverend Mothers  Â Â   Sandworms  Â Â   Spice agony  Â Â   War of Assassins  Â Â   Water of Life  Â Â   Dune  in popular culture               Technology  and weapons     Atomics  Â Â   Axlotl tank  Â Â   Crysknife  Â Â   Ghola  Â Â   Gom jabbar  Â Â   Heighliner  Â Â   Holtzman effect  Â Â   No-ship  Â Â   Stillsuit  Â Â   Vehicles                       Retrieved from "" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_(Dune) ""      Categories :  Dune characters Hidden categories:  Articles lacking sources from June 2008  |  All articles lacking sources  |  Articles that need to differentiate between fact and fiction                                   Views                   Article        Discussion        Edit this page        History                   Personal tools                Log in / create account                                 Navigation                Main page       Contents       Featured content       Current events       Random article                    Search                      Â                          Interaction                About Wikipedia       Community portal       Recent changes       Contact Wikipedia       Donate to Wikipedia       Help                    Toolbox                What links here       Related changes   Upload file   Special pages       Printable version      Permanent link Cite this page                                                   This page was last modified on 17 January 2009, at 21:19.

Following seasons have their episodes numbered, and are ordered by that number. The series has a total of 97 episodes: 26 each for the first two seasons, 13 for the third, 30 for the fourth, and the two-part prequel made alongside the third season. The last 7 episode of the series aired on  Cartoon Network Video , instead of on the network itself.

They try to interview Sissi, who was prom queen last year, but she turns them down and makes fun of their age, saying they'll never get a date. Milly tries to ask Ulrich out, and he is forced to turn her down. Upset, Milly storms off. In her room, she tells Tamiya that she hates everyone, with Xana listening from her computer. When Milly tells her teddy bear that she wishes she were bigger and leaves it in the garden shed, Xana possesses it and uses it to attack those who had made fun of her. It then increases the teddy bear's size to roughly two stories and sets it on the town. Now the group has to shut down the tower and protect the rest of the town from a rampaging teddy bear. After a return to the past, Milly asks Ulrich to the dance again, and Ulrich says yes, embarrassing Sissi.Â        2   "" Seeing Is Believing ""  ""Le voir pour le croire""   April 20, 2004   September 10, 2003   102       After a lecture on nuclear power in class, Odd begins casting for a traditional rock band called the Pop Rock Progressives. They need a drummer, and several try out for the position, including Nicolas. Nicolas turns out to be the best, but Odd is reluctant to let him on. Meanwhile, Xana decides to overload the nuclear power plant by storing electricity in a transformer and unleashing it on the plant all at once. Unsure if they can stop such an event, the group votes and, by a 3 to 2 vote (Aelita being the swing vote), decides to tell the authorities. Yumi goes to inform them while the others stay behind to deal with Xana. Now they must deactivate the tower before the city is turned into a nuclear wasteland. Not only that, they also have to do so before the authorities find out about the supercomputer.Â        3   "" Holiday in the Fog ""  ""Vacance dans la brume""   April 21, 2004   September 17, 2003   103       After Jeremie paints graffiti portraying Jim in a less than favorable light on a wall in order to remain at school during a vacation, Sissi overhears him talking with the others about his reasons for doing so: namely, watching Xana. She gets her father to let her stay there during the vacation so she can discover the group's secret. Xana takes the opportunity to possess several barrels full of poison and turns it into a deadly, living gas. When Jeremie finds out, he calls his friends away from their respective vacations. Xana uses the gas to attack Jeremie, Jim, and Sissi, and Jeremie just barely makes it out. Ulrich stays behind to find Jim and Sissi while the others go to deactivate the tower.Â        4   "" Log Book ""  ""Carnet de bord""   April 22, 2004   September 24, 2003   104       When Sissi finds Ulrich's diary, he is blackmailed into being her boyfriend. During a trip to a swimming pool, Jeremie and Yumi have the opportunity to find it. The new electric bus that is being used for the field trip is possessed by Xana, and starts acting weird as a result. Yumi ends up finding Sissi's diary during this, and uses it to blackmail her into giving up the location of Ulrich's. Xana then turns the bus on the city's petrol-chemical plant, threatening to blow up a sizable portion of the city.Â        5   "" Big Bug ""  ""Big Bogue""   April 23, 2004   October 1, 2003   105       Xana launches an attack on the Internet itself, managing to disable much of the city's infrastructure. Though most of the problems caused can be bypassed by manual controls, two trains that are completely automatic are put on a collision course, one of which contains a load of highly toxic chemicals.Â        6   "" Cruel Dilemma ""  ""Cruel Dilemme""   April 26, 2004   October 8, 2003   106       Due to a favorable accident on Odd's part, Jeremie's materialization program for Aelita is finished, but is only good for one use. In turn, Xana possesses two bulldozers and sets them on the factory to prevent Aelita's materialization from taking place. When trying to stop the attack, Yumi falls into the digital sea. To save her, Aelita gives up her materialization program, which allows Jeremie to bring back Yumi.Â        7   "" Image Problem ""  ""Problme d'image""   April 27, 2004   October 15, 2003   107       After an unexplained incident on Lyoko ends up devirtualizing Yumi without any cause, Yumi is taken to the infirmary. After waking up, she attacks Yolande. She continues to act weird throughout the day, wanting to go to Lyoko with everyone else. Jeremie won't let them, though, because he wants to know just what caused Yumi's devirtualization. Meanwhile, on Lyoko, Aelita finds several Kankrelats guarding an orange sphere, which she calls a Guardian, and informs Jeremie. Back at the school, the principal confronts Yumi about her attack on Yolande. When he threatens to call her parents, she attacks him, too. In another attempt to get the group to Lyoko, Yumi tries to seduce Jeremie to convince him to arrange a mission. She fails, but Odd and Ulrich stumble upon the scene. Jeremie tries to explain, leaving Yumi alone. Jeremie apologizes for the incident, citing Yumi's strange behavior. When they head back to his room, they find his computer destroyed. Yumi seems the likely culprit. She shows up to meet them, still wanting to go to Lyoko. Having no choice, they go, but Yumi stops the scanner before it can close, leaving her alone in the scanner room. As she goes to work destroying the scanners, the others find the real Yumi trapped inside the Guardian.Â        8   "" End of Take ""  ""Clap de fin""   April 28, 2004   October 22, 2003   108       After the principal shows a movie about aliens made director named James Finson, Finson announces that he plans to make a movie in the city, using the factory as the prime location. The group would rather not have people setting up shop in their factory, so Ulrich tries to convince Finson that making a movie there would be a bad idea. All his efforts achieve the opposite result, and he's even given a part in the movie, but the principal won't let him miss school. Sissi, who wants to be in the movie, convinces her father to let Ulrich miss school so she'll get a part. While Ulrich is guarding the lower levels, Xana possesses the alien monster prop and uses it to capture Ulrich and use him as bait for the others.Â        9   "" Satellite ""  ""Satellite""   April 29, 2004   October 29, 2003   109       During class, everyone's cell phones suddenly go off, and all of them are confiscated. Sissi is not happy about this, and organizes a protest in response. Yumi joins the protest, since having cell phones is a necessary part of the group's fight against Xana. Meanwhile, Jeremie investigates the strange occurrence and learns that Xana is using the school's antenna to take over the nearby television antenna. From there, Xana could take over a laser-equipped, military satellite. While Odd and Ulrich head to Lyoko to prevent Xana from doing so, Yumi stays behind to support Sissi's protest. As they head for the tower, Xana succeeds in taking over a military satellite and turns it on the school. Odd, who gets devirtualized, has to keep Yumi safe while Aelita and Ulrich look for a tower that seems to be invisible.Â        10   "" The Girl of the Dreams ""  ""Crature de rve""   April 30, 2004   November 5, 2003   110       After Jeremie makes another failed attempt to materialization Aelita, a student arrives at school that looks exactly like her. Jeremie is convinced that it must be her, but she seems to have no memory of her experiences with the group. The others aren't quite as convinced, but Jeremie insists that the materialization process must have caused her to lose her memory. Xana then possesses a suit of samurai armor that Yumi brought to school and sets it on the group.Â        11   "" Plagued ""  ""Enrags""   May 3, 2004   November 12, 2003   111       Xana possesses a rat that tries to sneak a bite from the school's kitchen. That rat goes on to bite other rats, putting them under Xana's control. Meanwhile, the school counselor has been watching Jeremie and believes him to be a gifted student. As such, he believes that Jeremie would be better off at a more advanced school and decides to give him an aptitude test. During the test, Xana's army of rats attacks the school.Â        12   "" Swarming Attack ""  ""Attaque en piqu""   May 4, 2004   November 19, 2003   112       After failing with an army of rats, Xana attempts a similar tactic using hornets. Meanwhile, Ulrich gets a letter from Yumi saying that she loves him. He's not quite sure how to respond, so he avoids talking to her about it. Jeremie and Odd find out about the note, but don't learn who wrote it. Ulrich tells them not to tell Yumi. After learning about the hornets and Xana's control over them, the group heads for the factory. Ulrich talks to Yumi about the note and that tells her that he feels the same way, only to find out that it was Sissi who wrote it. In Lyoko, Ulrich's reaction to the discovery leaves his performance lacking as the hornets move on the school.Â        13   "" Just in Time ""  ""D'un cheveu""   May 5, 2004   November 26, 2003   113       Taking a different approach to his research, Jeremie materializes a single hair of Aelita's. Unfortunately, the follow-up test goes awry, and Jeremie has to find out why. Meanwhile, different parts of the school begin to crumble apart. Jeremie learns that his first test damaged Aelita's program, and she'll be deleted if she tries to deactivate a tower. On top of that, they learn that Xana is responsible for the damage being caused to the school by using ultrasonic sound waves, which continues to get worse. Jeremie has to fix the damage he caused in time to save Odd, who ends up trapped in the school with Milly, Tamiya and Kiwi.Â        14   "" The Trap ""  ""Pige""   May 6, 2004   December 3, 2003   114       It's been a year since the group first discovered the supercomputer and Aelita, and they decide to throw a surprise party for Aelita. Sissi catches wind of the party, and follows Ulrich and Yumi to the factory. On the way there, Xana possesses the factory as a whole. Jeremie and Odd are the first to arrive at the factory, finding the elevator to be inoperable. They head off to find the fuse box. Once Ulrich and Yumi arrive there, Sissi confronts them about it. They tell her to leave, but Xana's earlier possession allows him to trap all three in the elevator and drop them to the bottom of the shaft. Sissi and Yumi come out ok, but Ulrich's arm is broken in the fall. Meanwhile, Jeremie and Odd have to deal with the possessed factory equipment.Â        15   "" Laughing Fit ""  ""Crise de rire""   May 7, 2004   December 10, 2003   115       In class, Mrs. Hertz is teaching the class about nitrous oxide, more commonly known as laughing gas, and its effects. It can be dangerous if not neutralized by water quickly. Meanwhile, Yumi's parents are having trouble with their relationship, which Yumi isn't too happy about. No one can seem to cheer her up, even Ulrich. He eventually manages to do so, however, and helps her find a way to bring her parents back together. During a school production of  Romeo and Juliet , Xana possess the laughing gas in the science room and uses it to attack Odd, who is doing the music. Sissi pours water on him, unaware of the cause of his maniacal laughing. When Odd tells the others about his experience, they realize that Xana must be behind it. The play turns out to be the perfect way to get Yumi's parents back together, so Ulrich, who is forced into playing Romeo, and Yumi, who plays a guard, stay behind while Odd heads to Lyoko. Just as Odd is about to go in, the Xana-possessed gas goes after each member of the group. Odd gets to Lyoko, but the gas goes with him, weakening him severely. Jeremie is chased away from the factory by the gas and is forced to take refuge in the sewer water. Finally, Ulrich and Yumi are attacked during the play. Aelita and a weakened Odd have to get to the tower before the others laugh themselves to death.Â        16   "" Claustrophobia ""  ""Claustrophobie""   May 10, 2004   December 17, 2003   116       When a boy named Theo takes an interest in Sissi, Herv becomes jealous and tries to get him expelled. The situation only gets worse when Xana possesses the cafeteria during lunch, trapping most of the students inside its electrified walls. Jeremie and Yumi leave the cafeteria before this takes place. Now Yumi has to has to get Aelita to the tower by herself before the cafeteria collapses in on itself.Â        17   "" Amnesia ""  ""Mmoire morte""   May 11, 2004   December 24, 2003   117       When Ms. Hertz gives a lesson on nanotechnology, she has small machine designed to produce the little robots as an example. Little do they realize that Xana has infected it, so when they find it filed with gel, Odd carelessly ends up pushing Ulrich's face into a small scoop of it. Later on, Ulrich gets a headache and collapses. When he wakes up, his memory is gone. Sissi is there at the time, so she uses Ulrich's memory loss to convince him that she's his girlfriend. As the rest of the group tries to bring him to his senses, more cases of amnesia occurs, spreading from person to person like a disease. Only after most of the school is affected does Jeremie realize that Xana-produced nanotechnology is responsible.Â        18   "" Killer Music ""  ""Musique mortelle""   May 12, 2004   December 31, 2003   118       When Xana creates an  MP3  file that puts anyone who listens to it into a coma, Odd ends up being the first victim. Soon, the rest of the city begins to follow.Â        19   "" Frontier ""  ""Frontire""   May 13, 2004   January 7, 2004   119       When Jeremie has a fight with Aelita, he tries to go to Lyoko to apologize. Unfortunately, a scanner error leaves him trapped in a virtual limbo between Lyoko and the real world.Â        20   "" The Robots ""  ""L'me des robots""   May 14, 2004   January 14, 2004   120       During a school robot competition, Xana sends a robot of his own to deal with the group. Ulrich and Yumi are forced to enlist Herv's help to destroy it while Jeremie and Odd head to the factory to shut down the tower.Â        21   "" Zero Gravity Zone ""  ""Gravit zro""   May 17, 2004   January 21, 2004   121       Just before an official school soccer game, Xana starts nullifying gravity by creating electromagnetic fields around specific areas. Ulrich does not want to help stop Xana this time around, instead needing to impress his parents, who will be attending the game. The others have to stop Xana before the entire school is sent into orbit.Â        22   "" Routine ""  ""Routine""   May 18, 2004   January 28, 2004   122       After many Xana attacks in a row, Ulrich starts to get tired of fighting Xana. On top of that, he questions his relationship with Yumi, and if she feels the same way about him.Â        23   "" Rock Bottom? ""  ""36e dessous""   May 19, 2004   February 4, 2004   123       During a vacation period at the school, the group plans to have a party at Yumi's house. Odd promises to have a DJ at the party. This DJ, named Samantha, is also his girlfriend, who goes to another school. After meeting up, she has Odd take her to the computer room. Once they arrive, she tries to steal a laptop, since she's too poor to afford one. Odd stops her, but ends up being caught by Jim. Meanwhile, Xana causes the ground under the city to melt, making all the buildings sink.Â        24   "" Ghost Channel ""  ""Canal fantme""   May 20, 2004   February 11, 2004   124       After another successful battle against Xana and another return trip, Odd, Ulrich, and Yumi are nowhere to be found. They, however, do not see anything wrong with where they are. Xana has trapped them in a world of its own design, and fashioned it after the school to ease their suspicions. Meanwhile, in the real world, Jeremie is being questioned on the group's disappearance. However, the world that Yumi, Odd, and Ulrich are in appears to have some glitches in it. Jeremie finds that this world can be accessed through the scanners, and after a near-death with Xana's virtual zombies, Aelita manages to save them.Â        25   "" Code: Earth ""  ""Code Terre""   May 21, 2004   February 18, 2004   125       Jeremie finally completes his materialization program and prepares to bring Aelita into the real world. At the same time, Jim's suspicions of the group have risen to the point that he's actively trying to discover their secret.Â        26   "" False Start ""  ""Faux Dpart""   May 24, 2004   February 25, 2004   126       Aelita's materialization program has worked and she's now living on Earth, but not all is well. A virus given to her by Xana has linked her to the supercomputer, preventing the group from shutting it off. Furthermore, Xana brings his Kankrelats into the real world in mass numbers and unleashes them on the school.Â          [ edit ]   Season 2: 2005       EP#   Title   Airdate (U.S.)   Airdate (France)   Prod. #       27   "" New Order ""  ""Nouvelle Donne""   September 19, 2005   August 31, 2005   201       After discovering Aelita's link to the supercomputer and the inability to shut off the supercomputer that stems from it, Jeremie works hard to find new and better ways to fight Xana. To that end, he develops new vehicles for the group. He also develops a new tower-scanning program that instantly detects activated towers, allowing Aelita to live on Earth. While adjusting to her new life, the class takes a trip to the nearby woods for a scientific field trip. Ulrich wants to partner up with Yumi, but she's already partnered up with someone named William. He comes from another school, having been expelled from it. During the field trip, Aelita and Jeremie partner up. Jeremie is forced to retrieve his laptop, leaving Aelita in the woods. With him gone, Aelita is frightened by visions of wolves, which lead her to a house known as the Hermitage. There, she has even more visions and is attacked by Xana. Once the others arrive to find her, they learn that Xana has possessed the house and uses everything in it to attack them. They find Aelita in a sauna in the basement. Xana tries to trap them all inside and boil them, but only succeeds in catching Ulrich and Yumi. Aelita and Odd head to the factory to shut down the tower before they are boiled alive.Â        28   "" Unchartered Territory ""  ""Terre inconnue""   September 20, 2005   September 7, 2005   202       While Aelita adjusts to her new life on Earth, Jeremie and the others investigate the mysterious owner of the Hermitage, Franz Hopper, and his link to the supercomputer, Lyoko, and Xana.Â        29   "" Exploration ""  ""Exploration""   September 21, 2005   September 14, 2005   203       After discovering Sector 5, the group decides to explore it. Yumi is forced to opt out after her continued late-night trips to Lyoko have drawn the attention of her parents.Â        30   "" A Great Day ""  ""Un grand jour""   September 22, 2005   September 21, 2005   204       After taking another trip to Sector 5 and returning to the school, Aelita talks to Jeremie about her not being human, unaware that Sissi is recording their conversation. On top of that, the data they had retrieved from Sector 5 takes over the supercomputer and starts running return trips over and over. Jeremie discovers that returning to the past makes XANA more powerful. During the third return trip Xana possesses Sissi with his new powers and goes after Ulrich. Not only does the group have to deal with Sissi, but they also have to stop the return trips.Â        31   "" Mister Pck ""  ""Mister Pck""   September 23, 2005   September 28, 2005   205       When Aelita's dreams and hallucinations become too disruptive to ignore, the group heads to the Hermitage to discover their source. There, Aelita finds a doll she inexplicably recognizes to be Mister Pck. Hidden on this doll is a key to a train station locker, which contains the heavily-encrypted diary of Franz Hopper. Upon its discovery, Xana takes action to insure they'll never be able to read it.Â        32   "" Saint Valentine's Day ""  ""Saint Valentin""   September 26, 2005   October 5, 2005   206       It's Saint Valentine's Day and love is in the air. When a man possessed by Xana leaves a necklace at Aelita's door, Aelita is convinced that it was Jeremie who got it for her. Since Jeremie didn't actually get it, he's left to wonder who did, and ends up suspecting Odd, who avoids the question. This puts the two at odds, so to speak. Meanwhile, Aelita's necklace takes control of her and forces her to deliver herself to the Scyphozoa.Â        33   "" Final Mix ""  ""Mix final""   September 27, 2005   October 12, 2005   207       When the school holds a concert in the gym, William accidentally drops a mixing board for the DJ contest. Odd offers to fix it, and tries to get Jeremie to help. Jeremie is busy, so Aelita offers her help. She easily fixes the device, and finds that she is quite talented in using it. The school is holding its finals, as well, and Odd finds that he is not prepared in the least.Â        34   "" Missing Link ""  ""Chanon manquant""   September 28, 2005   October 19, 2005   208       During a mission to Sector 5, Yumi is attacked by the Scyphozoa. It steals her digital genetic code, leaving her stranded on Lyoko. To make matters worse, it's picture day for her class. After some discussion, Ulrich gets the idea to have Sissi stand in for Yumi. Strangely, Sissi agrees and asks for nothing in return. During this, Jeremie tries to come up with a way to bring Yumi back. Aelita thinks of a way, but won't tell Jeremie about it. She only tells him once she gets to Lyoko, so he can't object. She begins to transfer her own genetic code to Yumi, which will let Xana take her memory at will.Â        35   "" The Chips Are Down ""  ""Les jeux sont faits""   September 29, 2005   October 26, 2005   209       When Ulrich learns that Yumi might have to go back to Japan because her father lost his job, he can't accept losing her. After a misguided attempt to write a letter to the president, he hears the lottery numbers on the radio and gets an idea. Using a return trip, he is able to get a ticket with the winning numbers and give it to Yumi's parents. When the others find out, they kick him out of the group until they can figure out what to do. To make matters worse, Xana activates a tower and possesses Nicolas. On top of that, he creates an army of Krabbes to guard it.Â        36   "" Marabounta ""  ""Marabounta""   September 30, 2005   November 2, 2005   210       After deciphering a part of Franz Hopper's diary, Jeremie gets an idea to make a monster that fights on the side of good. By combining techniques, he makes the Marabounta, a sphere that can replicate itself endlessly and devour any monster it can encase. Though it works quite well to begin with, everything goes wrong when it senses Aelita's link to Xana. After Odd attacks it to save her, it goes haywire and threatens to devour all of Lyoko. The Marabounta is repelled through a coalition of the Lyoko warriors and Xana's monsters, after which the monsters leave without causing trouble.Â        37   "" Common Interest ""  ""Intrt commun""   October 3, 2005   November 9, 2005   211       When the supercomputer's uranium power source begins to fail, Xana is forced to possess a local criminal named Peter Duncan to replace it. The supercomputer's periodic shutdowns threaten not only Xana, but also Aelita, whose heart stops beating with each shutdown.Â        38   "" Temptation ""  ""Tentation""   November 25, 2005   December 7, 2005   212       After a Xana attack, Jeremie insists on a return trip, regardless of the fact that Xana didn't even cause any damage. When questioned, he gets defensive and angry, insisting that it's necessary. Further questioning on the matter leads to the same result. After the next return trip, Jeremie is found unconscious in his room. Upon decoding a video diary that is stored on his computer, they learn that he had been using the return trips to increase his own intelligence. When he's about to be taken to the hospital, Xana attacks, possessing the ambulance and driving it towards the river. Now the others have to save Jeremie and deactivate the tower without Jeremie's help.Â        39   "" A Bad Turn ""  ""Mauvaise Conduite""   October 26, 2005   November 16, 2005   213       When Ulrich tries to tell Yumi how he really feels after some prodding by the rest of the group, he finds her talking to William, who is doing the same thing Ulrich had planned to. Yumi turns him down, but Ulrich leaves before hearing it. Meanwhile, Xana activates a tower and materializes a Krabe. At school, a driving class has been set up to teach the kids road safety. William turns out to be a good driver and Ulrich a rather poor one, which William makes fun of him for. The two then get into a fight and get detention because of it. Jeremie learns of the activated tower shortly after and the group heads to the factory without Ulrich. During this time, the Krabe makes its way to Yumi's house. When the group reaches the factory, they find a second Krabe guarding it. Yumi learns of the first Krabe from Hiroki and goes to help while Odd distracts the first so they can get to the elevator. In the scanner room, it's learned that the first two Krabbes destroyed the scanners that produced them, leaving just one usable. Aelita goes to Lyoko first. Before Odd can go, however, a third Krabe is materialized, preventing any further use of the scanners. Now Odd has to deal with this Krabe, Ulrich and William have to deal with the second, and Yumi and her family have to deal with the first. Not only that, but Aelita has to make her way to the tower without any support.Â        40   "" Attack of the Zombies ""  ""Contagion""   October 4, 2005   November 23, 2005   214       When Xana possesses Kiwi, it turns the little dog into the carrier for a virulent virus that turns those it infects into zombies.

Even worse, their atoms start to split after a while. The gang has to go to Lyoko and fix the problem before Odd and Yumi disappear forever, but it's not easy when Xana tries to stop them.Â        43   "" Xana's Kiss ""  ""Mon meilleur ennemi""   October 7, 2005   January 11, 2006   217       Xana creates a ghost that can change its shape at will and doesn't need to possess a host, then uses it to drive a wedge between the group by having it kiss people while disguised as them.Â        44   "" Vertigo ""  ""Vertige""   October 24, 2005   January 11, 2006   218       After a trip to Sector 5, Jeremie believes he has the data necessary to cure Aelita's virus. While the two work on the cure, Odd, Ulrich, and Yumi go to a rock climbing contest. Odd races against Herv, who is no match Odd. William then goads Ulrich into racing, despite his obvious reluctance. During the race, Ulrich gets dizzy and falls. Yumi realizes that he must have vertigo. Ulrich, embarrassed, runs off. Meanwhile, Jeremie finds the anti-virus and gives it to Aelita. Despite some problem with the application, it seems to work. However, this does not last. An error in the anti-virus causes her to turn invisible. On top of that, she can't enter the towers on Lyoko, making it impossible for her to stop Xana's latest attack, which is a possessed pack of wolves targeting Odd, Ulrich, and Yumi.Â        45   "" Cold War ""  ""Guerre froide""   October 25, 2005   January 18, 2006   219       A famous reporter named Thomas Vincent visits the school, planning to do a story on the lackluster performance of today's schools. Meanwhile, Xana begins to exhibit some strange behavior, activating towers and then deactivating them before the group can get to them. Confused, Aelita and Jeremie stay at the factory to investigate while the others head back. It's only after they head back that Xana takes action, activating a tower and causing a massive snowstorm. With a snowstorm between them and help, Jeremie is forced to send Aelita to Lyoko alone.Â        46   "" Dj Vu ""  ""Empreintes""   October 27, 2005   January 18, 2006   220       Aelita's visions become a problem once again, but not the same visions as before. This time, she has visions of her and Franz Hopper being chased by government agents. The visions come even when she's awake, causing her to lose consciousnesss while at the pool. Wanting to know the source of the visions, she heads to the Hermitage to learn more about them. Jeremie discovers that Xana is causing the visions through her link to the supercomputer. During the mission to stop them, Aelita breaks away and heads to Sector 5, determined to discover the source of the visions.Â        47   "" Tip-Top Shape ""  ""Au meilleur de sa forme""   October 28, 2005   January 25, 2006   221       During the school physicals, Xana possesses the school nurse, Yolande, and has her kidnap Aelita. The rest of the group beats her to the factory, but has no way to get Aelita from the far more powerful nurse. Having no other choice, Jeremie decides to test out an experiment which will give a person the same powers as one possessed by Xana. To do this, he has to activate a tower like Xana. Jeremie's towers turn green instead of red. Odd volunteers, and is enhanced by a ghost of Jeremie's design. This allows Odd to fight the nurse effectively while the others deactivate the tower. This fortune doesn't last, however. Xana is able to take over Jeremie's tower, reversing the effect of the ghost to drain Odd's energy. Now the group has to deactivate not only the original tower, but the tower that's draining Odd's energy.Â        48   "" Is Anybody Out There? ""  ""Esprit frappeur""   November 1, 2005   January 25, 2006   222       After reading about a dead man named Leon Corbe, who died during the construction of Kadic, Sissi decides to hold a sance to communicate with him. She manages to convince Ulrich to attend. During the sance, one of Xana's ghosts appears in the form of a four-armed monster. At first, it seem docile, but quickly gets angry and attacks. Ulrich leaves Sissi with Odd while he goes to tell Jeremie. Jeremie can't find an activated tower, which seems wrong considering the situation. As Jim patrols the hallways, he is picked up by an invisible object. Jeremie, Odd, and Ulrich arrive to spray it with a fire extinguisher, confirming that it's a ghost and implying that the super scan is broken. With the ghost on the loose, the group heads off to the factory. After they arrive, Aelita, Odd, and Yumi head to Lyoko. Odd looks for the tower while the other two head to Sector 5 to fix the super scan. Meanwhile, Jeremie and Ulrich are left to deal with the ghost.Â        49   "" Franz Hopper ""  ""Franz Hopper""   October 31, 2005   February 1, 2006   223       Jeremie discovers five activated towers and gathers the group to take care of them. When they arrive at the factory, they find a man at the interface, deactivating the towers as if it were a simple matter to do so. When questioned, the man says that he's none other than Franz Hopper. However, something seems off about this convenient arrival. Franz says that the scanners cause cell disintegration, and blames it on Jeremie. He then tells Jeremie to go away, so he goes to his room and calls his dad to take him to a school for gifted students. After that, he tells the group to go to Lyoko so that he can get rid of Xana. He sends Odd, Ulrich, and Yumi to ""clean up"" Sector 5. He then sends Aelita to the Desert Region, where the Scyphozoa is waiting for her. Her memory is drained and Franz Hopper, who is a Xana clone, starts laughing. Jeremie tells the clone that Aelita made a clone of herself on Lyoko. The clone evaporates when Aelita deactivates the tower.Â        50   "" Contact ""  ""Contact""   November 25, 2005   February 1, 2006   224       During a short film made by Odd and starring Sissi, Sissi seems to be possessed by a ghost. She does not act as expected, however. Instead, she starts speaking in some strange language, focusing on Jeremie as she does. She is taken to the infirmary as a result. Later on, she walks into Jeremie's room and writes some code on a piece of paper. Jeremie translates the code, revealing a message stating a desire to help. Sissi is sent to the hospital after this, forcing Odd and Yumi to go there and collect her. On a trip to Lyoko, Aelita and Ulrich discover a white tower. Xana isn't happy about the tower, and sends Megatanks to shut it down forcibly. At the same time, it activates a tower and possesses a nurse at the hospital to do the same to Sissi. Odd and Yumi are able to prevent the nurse from doing so. They bring Sissi to the factory to finish the message she started earlier. She manages to type most of it out before Xana succeeds in shutting down the white tower. After Xana's tower is shut down, Jeremie translates the message, revealing that Franz Hopper had activated the white tower.Â        51   "" Revelation ""  ""Rvlation""   December 9, 2005   February 8, 2006   225       It's nearing the end of the year and Jeremie's research has hit a dead end. After the group collects some data from Sector 5, he plans to use a tower to decipher Franz Hopper's diary. Before the mission, Odd gets a message from a mystery girl. When he goes to meet her, he is attacked by one of Xana's ghosts and locked inside a well at the Hermitage. The ghost then assumes Odd's form and goes to Lyoko in his place. The tower that Xana activated to make the ghost then deactivates, confusing Jeremie. Putting it out of his mind, he begins his plan to decipher the diary. Shortly after they begin, the ghost turns on the group, devirtualizing Yumi and chasing Ulrich away from the tower as three Tarantulas arrive to protect it. At the same time, Xana attempts to take over Jeremie's tower, locking the decoding procedure so they can't abandon it. Jeremie realizes the true nature of the ghost during the fight, and Yumi goes off to find the real Odd. After the ghost proves to be ineffective against Ulrich, it shapeshifts into a clone of Ulrich. In this form, it proves to be an equal match for him. After much fighting, Ulrich finally beats the clone, but is taken out by a Tarantula shortly after. Just when it looks like Jeremie's tower will fall, Franz Hopper steps in and protects it. The diary then decodes fully. After examining the diary, Jeremie tells Aelita that she is Franz Hopper's daughter.Â        52   "" The Key ""  ""Rminiscence""   December 9, 2005   February 8, 2006   226       After going through all of Franz Hopper's diary, Jeremie discovers the truth behind the supercomputer, at least to some extent. Hopper had used it quite extensively, to the point of repeating a single day for more than seven years. His sanity degraded throughout the experience. Hopper also revealed that he and Aelita hold the keys to Lyoko, which Xana was after. He only needed her half, now. The keys would allow him to escape the supercomputer. Jeremie also finds a way to free Aelita from the supercomputer. It turns out that Aelita never had a virus. In fact, Xana had been holding onto a piece of her, which was responsible for linking her to the supercomputer. Aelita is not willing to go, angry over the fact that Hopper had essentially taken her life from her. She's also worried that Xana might escape. To that end, she shuts down the supercomputer. Jeremie rescues her, and the group goes to Lyoko to retrieve her fragment. After all their efforts, they seem to succeed, but it turns out to be a fake. Xana manages to devirtualize Aelita's defenders and steal her memory, effectively killing her and allowing him to escape, which shuts down Lyoko in the process. His escape allows Franz Hopper to revive Aelita and Lyoko, restoring all of Aelita's memories in the process. Through the restoration, Aelita finally remembers her past up to the point that she went to Lyoko. With Xana now free and Aelita's memories returned, neither are linked to the supercomputer. This means that they could shut it down, but it would do no good. Unsure of how they'll proceed, Jeremie promises that they'll find a way to stop Xana.Â          [ edit ]   Prequel: 2006       EP#   Title   Airdate (U.S.)   Airdate (France)   Prod. #       N/A   "" Xana Awakens Part I ""  ""Le Rveil de XANA 1re partie""   October 2, 2006   October 21, 2006   N/A       In a prequel to the series, Jeremie discovers a supercomputer in an abandoned factory.

In a trip to Lyoko, Ulrich, Odd and Yumi work together to get Maya to the tower under the assumption that it will bring her to the real world. This assumption is ultimately false, shutting down Xana's attack rather than materializing her. Maya (who discovers her real name of Aelita when shutting down the tower) suggests they shut down the supercomputer, but the group decides to help Jeremie until Aelita is in the real world.Â          [ edit ]   Season 3: 2006       EP#   Title   Airdate (U.S.)   Airdate (France)   Prod. #       53   "" Straight to Heart ""  ""Droit au cur""   October 4, 2006   September 9, 2006   301       After another vacation, the group is still looking for a way to fight Xana.

While the Jeremie clone is impressing Jim outside, William appears on Lyoko. In order to maintain the clone, Jeremie must maintain an activated tower. William tries to put the tower under Xana's control. While Jeremie and Odd hold him off, Aelita, Yumi, and Ulrich go to Lyoko with new outfits and powers. They eventually deactivate the tower and stop William, who attempts to push Yumi into the digital sea, who in turn is saved by Odd at the last second. Jeremie then does a return to the past and replaces William with a clone to prevent any suspicion about his absence.Â        68   "" Opening Act ""  ""Premire Partie""   June 19, 2007   October 29, 2007   403       Jim's nephew Chris, the drummer of the Subdigitals, pays a visit to Kadic to look for an opening act for the band's next concert. Everybody tries out, and Aelita turns out to be the one Chris is looking for. However, circumstances make sure that Chris doesn't realize who Aelita is, and Xana's clone of him only complicates matters, kidnapping Aelita and sending her to Lyoko. Jim and Chris manage to involve themselves in their search for Aelita, and end up battling the clone while the rest of the group tries to deactivate the tower. After the threat is over, Jeremie executes a return trip so that Jim and Chris remember nothing. He also delivers Aelita's demo CD to Chris personally after doing so.Â        69   "" Wreck Room ""  ""Double Foyer""   June 26, 2007   August 15, 2007   404       There is a new recreation room at Kadic and William's clone is put in charge of it. Meanwhile, Jeremie has developed a program to get the real William out of Lyoko. However, the program malfunctions and bugs up the tower, allowing Xana to take it over while Aelita cannot shut it down. As the William clone lashes out at the group, the real William is on Lyoko to keep the tower under Xana's control. Jeremie manages to repair the tower in time for Aelita to reset it, restoring the clone to working order. With a return trip to erase the unwanted memories of William's behavior at school, the group elects Sissi as the rec room monitor.Â        70   "" Skidbladnir ""  ""Skidbladnir""   July 3, 2007   August 16, 2007   405       The new ""submarine"" (as Jeremie calls it) is almost complete, the last step being a secondary program that needs to be run by 4:00 p.m. the next day. However, when Aelita and Jeremie stay up late to set the program up, they are caught and given detention. William takes the opportunity to attack the incomplete sub, forcing Yumi to run the supercomputer in Jeremie's absence. Odd and Ulrich are unable to handle the situation, but Jeremie and Aelita are able to sneak out in time to help. Aelita is able to repel William with a massive attack, allowing Jeremie to complete the sub on-time. It is later christened Skidbladnir, nicknamed ""Skid"" by Odd, after  the Norse ship .Â        71   "" Maiden Voyage ""  ""Premier Voyage""   July 10, 2007   August 17, 2007   406       The gang manages to convince Jeremie to let them test out the Skid. During this test, the navigation system bugs up, leaving the gang stranded in the digital sea. Jeremie runs to his room to fetch the backup programs, but forgets that it's fire safety day and runs into several teachers, eventually having to scale the roof to get to his room. Meanwhile, the Skid stumbles upon another Lyoko and is attacked by two eel-like monsters. Jeremie is able to repair the navigation system and bring his friends home, after which he surmises that the replica of Lyoko was created from the data Xana stole from Aelita's memories in ""The Key"". Jeremie wonders how he plans to use it.Â        72   "" Crash Course ""  ""Leon de choses""   July 17, 2007   August 20, 2007   407       Jeremie decides to teach Odd, Ulrich, and Yumi how to use the supercomputer in case he or Aelita are unable to. During the lesson, Jeremie is attacked by one of Xana's polymorphic clones, leaving the others to operate the supercomputer without help. Aelita is at the final audition with the Subdigitals, competing against two other candidates, and thus cannot be contacted. To make matters worse, the clone heads for her after dealing with Jeremie. Using what they learned from Jeremie, the others are able to rescue Aelita and deactivate the tower without his help. Aelita is also chosen as the winner of the audition.Â        73   "" Replika ""  ""Rplika""   July 24, 2007   August 21, 2007   408       The group travels to one of Xana's Lyoko replicas in the digital sea. Meanwhile, Aelita and Odd get into a fight after Odd's desire to sleep in gets them both in trouble. Furthermore, their arguing inadvertently leads Nicolas and Herve into the factory, where Jeremie is forced to distract them while the group explores the Lyoko copy. On the replica Lyoko, William and a pair of Megatanks arrive to destroy the Skid, the destruction of which would cut the group off from the supercomputer. Odd and Aelita refuse to work together when they first arrive, but eventually resolve their differences and take William down. Jeremie surmises that another supercomputer is controlling the replica, and in order to get rid of it he'll have to find a way to materialize his friends at the location of the supercomputer.Â        74   "" I'd Rather Not Talk About It ""  ""Je prfre ne pas en parler!""   July 31, 2007   August 22, 2007   409       The group turns to Jim for training so they can be better prepared to fight Xana. However, things go bad when Xana possesses a boar to attack them with, forcing them to put their training to good use to avoid it. Furthermore, Xana sends William and a group of Mantas to attack Lyoko's core. Jeremie stays behind to help Jim while the others repel the attack. Jim risks his life to save Jeremie when the two encounter their attacker in a cave, and Aelita deactivates the tower in time to save them both.Â        75   "" Hot Shower ""  ""Corps cleste""   August 14, 2007   August 23, 2007   410       When a comet passes near Earth, Xana uses a laser-equipped military satellite to split it into chunks, simultaneously aiming the bulk of it directly at the factory. Aelita, Odd, and Ulrich are exploring the digital sea at the time, and Xana traps them with a firewall to prevent them from stopping the attack. Meanwhile, Yumi is stuck at school and, when informed of the attack, works to evacuate the school. Jeremie tells Yumi to connect his laptop to an antenna to tap into the military satellite and destroy the comet. She does so with help from Hiroki and Johnny. However, Xana prevents him from doing so. Unable to stop the attack, Aelita reasons that Xana is more concerned with taking her prisoner than destroying the supercomputer, and to test it has Odd devirtualize her. Having guessed correctly, she watches as Xana destroys the comet of his own accord.Â        76   "" The Lake ""  ""Le Lac""   August 21, 2007   August 24, 2007   411       Jeremie, Aelita, Ulrich, and Odd go with the rest of their science class on a field trip to an island in the middle of a nearby lake to study water-based plantlife. Yumi, not part of the class, remains behind to sit through two important exams. Jeremie's fears about Xana attacking at such an inopportune moment are realized when Xana creates an electricity-blasting sludge that attacks anyone who approaches the shore. Yumi is forced to go to Lyoko alone, and during her fight with William, is temporarily able to reach William's true personality. Though the evil William eventually reasserts himself, Yumi is saved by Aelita, who escaped the island. Aelita is able to shut down the tower and initiate a return trip to save the class from electrocution.Â        77   "" Lost at Sea ""  ""Torpilles virtuelles""   August 28, 2007   August 27, 2007   412       Hiroki steals Yumi's diary and Ulrich finds it. Meanwhile, in a new attempt to free William from Xana's clutches, Jeremie creates a program to find William. When he uploads the program to the Skid, the sonar becomes bugged, forcing the gang to return to Lyoko. When monsters interrupt their return, Yumi is lost in the digital sea. Xana's attempt to take advantage of this alerts Jeremie, allowing him to direct his friends to Yumi. After fighting off the monsters and William, who has his own ship to travel in, they return to Earth. To help Hiroki apologize to his sister, Ulrich secretly returns the diary.Â        78   "" Lab Rat ""  ""Exprience""     August 28, 2007   413       Jeremie has perfected his ""Teleportation"" process, allowing him to send his friends to the location of Xana's supercomputer. He uses it on Aelita and Odd first, sending them to the jungle laboratory containing the supercomputer. As they explore, they find that Xana is constructing dog-sized mechanical spiders with the help of a team of possessed scientists. Before they can stop him, however, William manages to sever their connection to the real world, bringing them back to Lyoko in the middle of their mission. In a side story, Yumi is angry with Ulrich because Ulrich has forgotten her birthday, so Odd promises to get Yumi a present for him because Ulrich has detention.Â        79   "" Bragging Rights ""  ""Arachnophobie""   September 8, 2007   August 29, 2007   414       Having failed to destroy Xana's supercomputer in the previous episode, the group sets out to finish the job. Meanwhile, Odd's bragging gets the better of him, and he makes a bet with Ulrich not to brag for 24 hours. However, circumstances conspire to constantly put him in the spotlight, and when he ultimately destroys the supercomputer, Odd becomes convinced that being a braggart is something he can be proud of.Â        80   "" Dog Day Afternoon ""  ""Kiwodd""   September 15, 2007   August 29, 2007   415       Odd tries to take Kiwi to Lyoko, but ends up absorbing the little dog instead. As a result, Odd slowly begins to take on dog traits, such as enhanced smell and scratching himself with his foot. While Jeremie works on separating the two, Xana possesses a biker gang to attack them. Jeremie manages to split Odd and Kiwi while Aelita deactivates the tower.Â        81   "" A Lack of Goodwill ""  ""il pour il""   September 22, 2007   August 30, 2007   416       Jeremie has developed a program to make the William clone smarter, but the learning curve is still problematic, as it tries to fling a glass into the air from a fork. Milly and Tamiya, overhearing the group's conversation about the clone, decide to ask him personally. The clone, having never been told to keep the information a secret, reveals everything to them, and even takes them to the factory. Meanwhile, Jeremie plans a mission to the next Replika, a copy of the Desert sector. During the trip, William emerges from a scanner and tries to destroy the supercomputer. With the help of Milly, Tamiya, and the William clone, he is defeated, and a return trip keeps Milly and Tamiya in the dark about the supercomputer.Â        82   "" Distant Memory ""  ""Mmoire blanche""   September 29, 2007   August 31, 2007   417       It's holiday time at Kadic and everyone is headed home. Aelita, however, has no home to go to. As she watches over Lyoko, she gets a message from Franz Hopper, who has constructed a simultion bubble of their mountain home on Lyoko. Though happy to see her father, Aelita quickly learns that the entire thing is a ruse: her father is just an illusion and William is there waiting for her. The rest of the group, having been unable to contact Aelita, follows her onto Lyoko, but they fail to keep William from throwing her into the digital sea. When it seems as if she's gone, she is lifted from the sea by the real Franz Hopper, who has manifested himself as a floating purple sphere. After dropping her back on Lyoko, he returns to the digital sea.Â        83   "" Hard Luck ""  ""Superstition""   October 6, 2007   September 8, 2007   418       When Odd breaks a mirror, bad luck follows him everywhere, even to Lyoko. A bug in his virtual avatar spreads to his friends, causing annoying pauses and random devirtualization. Meanwhile, at the site of the Replika supercomputer, Xana materializes Kankrelats to stop Ulrich and Yumi. Despite the bug, their mission to destroy Xana's next Replika ends in success, and Odd's luck returns soon afterwards.Â        84   "" Guided Missile ""  ""Missile guid""   October 13, 2007   September 15, 2007   419       Jeremie wins a contest to take a flight in a  fighter jet , even though it was Odd who entered him into the contest in the first place. However, just before takeoff, Xana possesses the jet and sends it to destroy the factory. As it closes in, Aelita, Odd, Ulrich, and Yumi struggle against William, who devirtualizes them one by one in his attempt to throw Aelita into the digital sea. Ulrich is the one to come out on top and Aelita is able to deactivate the tower. A return to the past is launched before the factory is destroyed, and Odd gets his chance to ride in the jet afterwards.Â        85   "" Kadic Bombshell ""  ""La Belle de Kadic""   November 3, 2007   September 22, 2007   420       When Sissi's friend from Iceland, Brynga, arrives at the school, all the boys swoon over her, making Sissi envious. When Brynga takes an interest in Odd, he ends up showing her the supercomputer. While there, she messes with the computer despite Odd's pleas not to, creating a glitch in the supercomputer that causes every virtualization to happen in the wrong sector and prevents materialization. This becomes all the more problematic when William catches Aelita alone on Lyoko. When forced to choose between his friends and his new love interest, Odd initially stays with her, but decides that his friends are more important. After rescuing Aelita from William, they make up. As Brynga has not been told anything about the purpose of the supercomputer, they have no need to perform a return trip before she leaves.Â        86   "" Canine Conundrum ""  ""Kiwi superstar""   November 10, 2007   September 29, 2007   421       When Kiwi's mindless destruction becomes too much for the group to bear, they force Odd to keep him at the factory. As Odd drops him off, Xana possesses Jeremie's Kiwi 2 robot, turning it into an army of self-replicating attack dogs. The dogs attack Yumi and Ulrich, among other children, during Jim's  Pencak Silat  class. After Aelita deactivates the tower and a return trip erases the incident, the group decides that the regular Kiwi isn't that bad, after all.Â        87   "" A Space Oddity ""  ""Plante Bleue""   November 17, 2007   October 6, 2007   422       Because of a surprise dorm inspection, Odd has to convince Yumi to keep Kiwi at her house. Jeremie, meanwhile, has located the next Replika, a copy of Sector 5. Its supercomputer is located on a newly-built space station orbiting Earth. While Odd and Yumi work to disable it, Aelita and Ulrich work to disable the Replika Sector 5's defenses, which threaten to destroy the Skid. To make matters worse, the supercomputer is guarded by a trio of floating spheres that can grow spikes and melt through solid metal. In the end, Odd disables the supercomputer by breaking some cooling pipes in the room. All the while, Yumi's family has been having fun with Kiwi, much to Odd and Yumi's surprise.Â        88   "" Cousins Once Removed ""  ""Cousins ennemis""   November 17, 2007   October 13, 2007   423       Jeremie's cousin, Patrick, comes to visit. Jeremie isn't entirely happy about it, since Patrick is ""super cool"" compared to him. Discovering another Replika, Jeremie and his friends plan a mission to destroy it, leaving Sissi alone with Patrick. She is able to convince him to let Herve rummage through Jeremie's computer files. Herve discovers Aelita's forged documents and the program running the Skid, his efforts to decipher it inadvertantly draining the Skid's power. To make matters worse, Xana possesses both him and Sissi to cause even more damage. Jeremie, meanwhile, deduces that it's his computer causing the damage, and works with Patrick to stop them. Once the attack has passed, Jeremie has Aelita run a return trip to undo the damage caused. The second time around, Jeremie is a bit more appreciative of his cousin, since the two worked well together before.Â        89   "" Music to Soothe the Savage Beast ""  ""Il est sens d'tre insens""     October 20, 2007   424       Aelita's first concert with the Subdigitals is coming up, but Aelita's stage fright threatens to get the better of her. Odd meanwhile, has to find an extra ticket so he can bring a date. When the concert finally starts, Xana attacks, possessing the stage manager in order to kidnap Aelita. He also possesses Milly and Tamiya for some extra help. While Ulrich battles the two reporters, the others work to shut down the tower, all while the Subdigitals' music plays in the background. Once the threat is over, Jeremie activates a return to the past so Aelita won't miss the concert.Â        90   "" Wrong Exposure ""  ""Mduse""     October 27, 2007   425       Aelita finds a photo of herself with Franz Hopper at the Hermitage, with a mathematical equation in the background. Jeremie discovers that the program works as a reset feature to Lyoko, something not too helpful but useful nonetheless. Meanwhile, Odd, in an attempt to impress a girl in photography class, inadvertently sends the photo to Sissi, who in turn shows it to her father. He questions the group about it, with Jeremie pointing out that Aelita would obviously be twenty-two by now if she were the one in the photo. Before he can follow up on it, the principal is possessed by Xana. He delivers Aelita to Lyoko, where the Scyphozoa is waiting for her. It takes control of her and tries to force her to walk into the digital sea, but Ulrich and Yumi are there to keep her from doing so. As they battle Aelita and the monsters, Jeremie uses the reset program, clearing Aelita's possession and allowing her to deactivate the tower. After performing a return trip, Aelita explains that her real last name isn't Hopper, it's Schaeffer (the name listed on the folder in the end credits). Hopper is the last name of her mother, Antea. In addition, Franz's supposed first name is actually his middle name.Â        91   "" Bad Connection ""  ""Mauvaises Ondes""     November 3, 2007   426       Odd is presenting one of his films, but is unhappy because his parents are coming. According to him, they never find fault in anything he does, which he finds dissatisfying. However when he's finally pressured into it, Xana attacks. He is using the school's cell phone antenna to spread a virus to everyone who answers their phone to cause them to become vicious, angry zombies a la Stephen King's  Cell , starting with Odd's parents. With the widespread use of cell phones, all but the Lyoko warriors and Sissi are affected, Sissi having had her phone accidentally broken by her father. While she and Odd attempt to evade the possessed students and faculty, the others deactivate the tower. Once a return trip wipes everyone's memories, Odd plays his video, which showcases all the humorous moments at Kadic.Â        92   "" Cold Sweat ""  ""Sueurs froides""     November 3, 2007   427       When an embarrassing picture of Yumi is printed in the Kadic newspaper, she turns to Odd as the source. He manages to get Ulrich to take the blame, however, causing tension between Ulrich and Yumi. Putting that aside, Jeremie sets up a mission to the next Replika, a copy of the Ice sector. Its supercomputer is located in Siberia, where Xana is growing brains for an unknown purpose. Odd and Yumi are sent to the real world to destroy it, only to be confronted by William. When trying to shut down the tower, Aelita realizes that the data it is generating could be used to free William. After downloading the necessary data and disabling William, everything seems to be set for destroying the Replika. However, Xana draws on the power of his many Replikas to create a new monster: the ""Kolossus"", a massive creature resembling a fire elemental with a sword for a hand. It easily devirtualizes Aelita and Ulrich, and nearly destroys the Skid, as well. With this new development, and the realization that Xana has hundreds of supercomputers at his command, Jeremie has to change strategies. Meanwhile, Yumi forgives Ulrich for the picture, and Odd admits to his deception soon after. Yumi gets back at both of them by getting a picture of the two coming out of the shower in the paper.Â        93   "" Down to Earth ""  ""Retour""     November 3, 2007   428       In order to defeat Xana, whom they have vastly underestimated, Jeremie plans to design another multi-agent system to combat him. That, however, is still under development. In more immediate matters, Jeremie has figured out how to free William from Xana, but needs to run his program directly from the Ice Replika supercomputer. Meanwhile, William's parents arrive to visit their son, and the strange behavior of his clone concerns them greatly. Back at the Replika, Jeremie uses some new tricks to stop the Kolossus, allowing Aelita and Odd to reach the supercomputer without worry. However, an army of robotic drones now stationed at the facility complicates matters. With some effort, Aelita and Odd are able to run the program to free William, but their victory comes at a cost: though William is saved, the Skid is destroyed by the Kolossus. Back on Earth, William is able to take his clone's place, pacifying his concerned parents. Ulrich, meanwhile, has to deal with William's affection for Yumi once more.Â        94   "" Fight to the Finish ""  ""Contre-attaque""     November 10, 2007   429       With the Skid gone and Xana's Replikas at unmanageable numbers, Jeremie continues work on his multi-agent system. Meanwhile, Aelita has nightmares about her father being killed by Xana. As Jeremie works, he is contacted by Franz Hopper, who arranges a meeting on Lyoko. William wants to help, but all except Aelita are a little wary of trusting him again. William is left in the lab with Jeremie. After meeting up, Franz transmits the data necessary to finish Jeremie's multi-agent system. However, Xana is not willing to give up without a fight, activating a tower to possess William while sending the Kolossus to deal with Franz. Yumi is devirtualized and fights William while the others protect Franz. Once Franz is finished transmitting the data, Aelita and Odd head to Sector 5 to finish the program. However, a problem arises: the energy requirements are too great. Aelita's nightmare is realized when Franz sacrifices himself to power the program, and in doing so Xana is wiped out completely. Though a great victory for them, the loss of Franz Hopper leaves them with little reason to celebrate.Â        95   "" Echoes ""  ""Souvenirs""     November 10, 2007   430       Now that their mission is over, the group looks back on all their fond memories of Lyoko. Sissi, meanwhile, plants a tracking device on Ulrich in order to discover their secret. When it comes time to shut down the supercomputer, all but Yumi are unwilling to go through with it: Aelita is still holding onto the hope that her father can be saved, Jeremie doesn't want to take away the thing which made them friends, and Odd and Ulrich both liked being heroes. While they muse over their attachments to Lyoko, Sissi finds her way into the computer lab, and Jeremie's open diary reveals the whole of their adventures. When Sissi tries to explain this to her father, he believes she has lost it and sends her to the infirmary. A return to the past deals with that problem. Ulrich stops Sissi from planting the tracker on the repeat attempt, and the group invites her as a friend. Once more at the supercomputer, the group uniamously decides to shut it off, closing the book on their adventures.Â          [ edit ]   See also     List of Code Lyoko media                   v Â   Â  d Â   Â  e     Code Lyoko             Characters :     Aelita Â    Franz Hopper Â    Jeremie Belpois Â    Jim Morals Â    Odd Della Robbia Â    Elisabeth Delmas Â    Ulrich Stern Â    William Dunbar Â    Xana Â    Yumi Ishiyama Â    SecondaryÂ characters               Monsters :     Bloks Â    Creepers Â    Krabes Â    Guardians Â    Hornets Â    Kankrelats Â    Kalamars Â    Kolossus Â    Kongres Â    Sharks Â    Mantas Â    Marabounta Â    Megatanks Â    PolymorphicÂ clone Â    Scyphozoa Â    Tarantulas Â    TransportÂ Orb Â    Video game monsters               Lyoko :     IceÂ Barrier Â    Desert Â    Forest Â    Mountain Â    Carthage Â    DigitalÂ sea Â    VirtualÂ limbo Â    Replika               Other:     Media Â    Episodes Â    Garage Kids Â    Subdigitals Â    Code Lyoko  (video game) Â    Code Lyoko: Quest for Infinity Â    Code Lyoko: Fall of X.A.N.A.

When he fled from her, traveling to  Earth-616  where he knew he had an identical looking counterpart,  Earth-616 's  Captain Britain , she sent armored troops to retrieve him. They mistakenly attacked Captain Britain twice, but were repelled on each occasion, the first time by Britain and his ally  Meggan , the second by Britain's sister  Betsy . Sat-Yr-9 next hired the interdimensional mercenary group, the  Technet , but Briton swapped places with Britain, and the Technet took the wrong man back to Earth-794. Britain later convinced the Technet of their error, but Sat-Yr-9 tried to stop them departing with him; the Technet slaughtered her soldiers, and the already psychotic Sat-Yr-9 became completely unhinged. After they departed, she started slaughtering her subjects, leading  Roma  to send  Captain UK  on a mission to overthrow and imprison her.   While Britain was on Earth-794, Briton was killed by Betsy when he tried to rape her.     [ edit ]   Courtney Ross          Sat-Yr-9 kills Courtney Ross to take her place. Art by  Alan Davis .       Escaping to Earth-616 through a dimension gateway that had been opened by  Widget  for an unassuming civilian on Earth-616, Sat-Yr-9 killed her alternate reality counterpart, a businesswoman named  Courtney Ross , and took her place. An example of interdimensional similarities, Ross was Captain Britain's ex-girlfriend. As Ross, she tried to create a rift between Captain Britain and his current girlfriend  Meggan .   Sat-Yr-9 also knew about  Jamie Braddock 's reality warping powers before anyone else including himself did (since she knew about the reality warping powers of Jamie's alternate reality counterpart in her timeline of origin), hiring the Technet through a proxy, Nigel Frobisher, to rescue the imprisoned Earth-616 Jamie, intending to use his great powers as a living weapon against difficult adversaries.   She used Jamie's powers to change Frobisher into a duplicate of the London Crime  Vixen , while changing Vixen herself into a fox. With Frobisher as Vixen, Sat-Yr-9 took over the Vixen's crime syndicate.   With her powerbase built, she attacked  Excalibur , revealing her true identity to them. She tried to enslave Captain Britain, against Frobisher's advice. Frobisher rebelled and was killed by her. Excalibur managed to defeat Jamie, and Sat-Yr-9 and her troops were forced to flee. Captain Britain swore to avenge Courtney's death, but was unable to track Sat-Yr-9 down.     [ edit ]   Hellfire Club   After the events of House of M, Sat-Yr-9 appeared once again under the alias of ""Courtney Ross"", she has joined the  Hellfire Club  as its White Queen, with  Viper , a former HYDRA assassin, as her self-proclaimed ""White Princess"" and bodyguard. She has been seen publicly appearing as Courtney Ross again, trying to convince Captain Britain that she somehow is the real Courtney Ross. So far Captain Britain remains unconvinced, but hasn't moved against her.     [ edit ]   Notes     Along with Courtney Ross, Sat-Yr-9 has another alternate reality counterpart;  Saturnyne , the Omniversal Majestrix of  Otherworld  and a servant of Roma.   An alternate version of Sat-Yr-9 appears in  Paradise X : Heralds , where she displays the power to control men through pheromones. The regular Sat-Yr-9 never displayed this ability. This version is called Saturnyne, despite her appearance being that of Sat-Yr-9.   Sat-Yr-9 can be distinguished visually from her alternate reality counterparts by a  tattoo  of her stylized knife emblem on her right thigh.

Natgoo  12:57, 1 January 2006 (UTC)           Tyr  was not the ""sky god"". He was the god of war. -- BluePlatypus  16:16, 1 January 2006 (UTC)                   The page linked to above could be clearer, granted - they need a semicolon between 'Tyr' and 'the sky god' instead of a comma. The  Tyr  article tells us that Tyr ""goes back to a Proto-Germanic Twaz, continuing Proto-Indo-European Dyeus"". Moving on to the  Dyeus  article, we read that ""he was the god of the daylit sky"" and ""addressed as the  Sky Father "". According to these articles, then, Tiwaz is both Tyr and the sky god.

Dismas | (talk)  15:33, 1 January 2006 (UTC)     You can with most PCs, but still check it out.     What you want to check for is to make sure that you have an empty bank of RAM on the motherboard or that the RAM which comes with it can be removed. You might also want to check exactly what kind of RAM it takes and how available it is ahead of time, both to check if it is available (it probably is) and whether you will save much by scrimping. But generally speaking, yes, you can usually upgrade RAM separately on new computers and you can often save a lot of money by doing it through a 3rd party rather than buying your RAM direct from the computer distributor. -- Fastfission  22:15, 1 January 2006 (UTC)       Crucial's website  has a service to check what is the right memory for most common computer systems. Try there first.

Most computers nowadays have about 512 RAM in them. RAM allows you to open more windows and do more options like also play a CD at the same time without slowing down your computer. 256 RAM isn't bad if you are just using your computer for e-mail and IMing. If you are doing something like gaming with heavy graphics or graphic engineering you would need at least 512 RAM, probably 1 GB (Gigabyte) for good performance. -Rod O-     [ edit ]   commodities   What was the second most traded commodity in the world in 2004?     Not antimatter, if it's that expensive.  Kid Apathy  22:23, 1 January 2006 (UTC)       According to  this page  ( ""After oil, coffee is the worlds most traded commodity"" ) it's coffee. I'm a bit sceptical though - to begin with, the page doesn't say if it's counted in weight, volume or value. And even though oil seems reasonable as #1, there are many commodities that I personally use a lot more of ( wheat  for example, or  water ). And I live in the second-most coffe-drinking country in the world,  Sweden !  This page  seems more reasonable to me, but they also, unfortunately, seem to have a totally differing definition of ""commodity"". So the answer, really, is ""it depends"", I guess.

Could be you're hitting a  reflex zone .Â :)  GeeJo   (t)   (c)      02:39, 2 January 2006 (UTC)     While there's no  real  reason I can think of here's another idea. If perhaps at one time when you put your socks on, as a coincidence your back became itchy. This set up in your mind the idea that putting on socks makes your back itchy. Now, every time you put them on then your brain tells you that your back is itchy. This is not quite as silly as it sounds. After getting very sick from eating spoiled mushrooms I find that I can no longer eat them at all. Yet even though I know that fresh mushrooms will not make me sick I am unable to eat them.  CambridgeBayWeather   (Talk)  02:43, 2 January 2006 (UTC)       It could be that you have dry skin on your back, and when you bend over to put on your socks, you stretch that dry skin and irritate it. Also, are you putting on your socks after taking a shower? Soap can further dry your skin, so you'll notice it as you dress.

Additionally, when one washes socks one usually adds soap and stain removers, so its possible you skin is reacting to some chemical in the cleaning supplies.

Then use the registry editor to locate the keys HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/Windows/Currentversion/Run and Runonce (directly below) and remove any unwanted entries (be careful here, regedit doesn't have an undo function, and it's easy to completely mess up your XP installation if you don't know exactly what you are doing).   Some programs might also be executed as a service (ie, a background task); these can be controlled from control panel>administrative tools>services (again, be careful not to deactivate necessary services).   Finally, locate a file called win.ini, open it with the text editor and look for an entry called ""run=""; some programs might be started that way. Note: win.ini is there for backward compatibility with the stone age (ie, Win3.11), I am not sure if starting programs from there still works in XP (I am fairly certain it still worked in Win2k, though).       Hope that helped, --  Ferkelparade     21:41, 1 January 2006 (UTC)       Some anti-adware software centralizes all of this and makes it pretty easy to see what is starting up and disable it safely. I know that  Spybot - Search & Destroy  has a tool that does this included in it; it might make things easier for you than messing with the Registry, which can be daunting and dangerous for someone who doesn't know how to use it. -- Fastfission  22:10, 1 January 2006 (UTC)       Rather than look in all four places mentioned above, you can use Start->Run->msconfig to get a built-in tool to look at and disable startup programs.- gadfium  23:19, 1 January 2006 (UTC)           This is an excellent solution.

Don't you mean  DVD -ROM? Anyway, does your computer have a DVD player or recorder. They are similar to CD-ROM drives, but read (and/or write) DVDs instead. -  131.211.210.11  10:35, 2 January 2006 (UTC)   DVD-RAM  is a special kind of DVD drives that never became a consumer hit. Its main use has been backup systems, but even there it's not ubiqutous. Most drives nowadays don't have support for it. Unless you have an old drive around, you'll probably have to shop specifically for this feature as it normally isn't included anymore in standard drives. Count on having to pay more than for a regular drive.  TERdON  15:00, 2 January 2006 (UTC)       RAM indeed means 'random access memory', but what they meant is that the disk is writeable, which is something completely different. It's a misconception that RAM is the opposite of ROM (which means 'read only memory'). Just because of the stupidity of the name (a disk can never be ram) I'm glad that that attempt at a standard did not succeed.  DirkvdM  19:02, 2 January 2006 (UTC)     A DVD-RAM disc can play in your DVD-based drive, assuming that drive is compatible.

It would appear from your writing that English is not your first language, so if you want a career in an English speaking nation, you need to do serious improvement in your communication skills. For example, you have not put this into the earlier Q+A area, which means you lack the English skills to read the instructions at the top of the page. Don't worrry, lots of people are incapable of reading those instructions, and those same people have trouble getting a job, because at any employer, there's all kinds of pre-employment forms to fill out, and people who can't comprehend the forms, do not get the jobs. Your above question is filled with lots of non-standard abbreviations, which is why I think English is not your first language.    If you now have the degree, you should look for companies whose work use what that degree is in ... this is something you should have figured out while you were still working towards the degree. It should be evident from the classes in the subject material, what kinds of enterprises logically would do that work. There are engineers who have to figure out how to design products, that are safe for the workers, and economical for the businesses. A product needs to work correctly in all kinds of environments ... outdoors where it rains a lot, temperature extremes. The food industry is a branch of chemilcal engineering. This is more demanding because of safety to the consumers. Pharmaceuticals are even more demanding, because to the testing needied to prove that they are safe.               If you are still working towards a degree, ask if your University has a  co-op  program. This is where students spend several months in classes, and several months in entry level positions at enterprises related to the classroom subjects. If the enterprise likes your skills, talent, dedication, etc. they may offer you a job upon graduation. The University will have an office to help you locate companies that support the co-op system. You get paid, low wages to be sure, at the co-op work. but that can help with tuition expenses.       Many people want a handsome income. Many other people want an interesting life, good job security, respectable work. Ideal is if you can get all of it. Most people end up spending first few years of their career in jobs that are none of the above.

First of all, forget about ""utilizing all your potential"" or ""doing your education justice."" What do you want to do? What is either going to (a) help you live the life you want to live or (b) give your life meaning and satisfaction? I realize these two questions are BIG questions, and a lot of us try our whole lives to get answers to them without success, but it's a good place to start. The truth is, whatever you find yourself doing, if you care enough about it (for whatever reason), you will put your education to use and you will realize your potential. I've been a high school teacher for ten years, and despite seeing friends of lesser ability make three times as much money as me in careers that are one-third as difficult, I know I've chosen the right path.

[[Sam Korn]]  13:31, 2 January 2006 (UTC)           Yeah, but also, some editors have made particular efforts to mark any Jewish subject of an article as Jewish.

It's pretty peculiar. -- jpgordon   17:33, 2 January 2006 (UTC)           I don't think the original statement is true, despite the evidence given.

DirkvdM  19:07, 2 January 2006 (UTC)     I suspect the prevalence of the Jewish mention is a combination of several factors: some people are famously Jewish, some anti-Semites put in the mention because they think it matters, some fans put it in because they want everything known about their hero to be mentioned, some Jewish people want there to be lots of Jewish role models.       I haven't seen a lot of Euro-American mentions. If you ask a  queer theorist , they'll probably say it's an ethnic variant of  heteronormativity . If you ask  Frank Weltner  he'll probably say it's because us academic liberals don't want Euro-Americans to be proud of their heritage. If you ask me, it's because 1) in our post-PC times being Euro-American is boring, and 2) it's pretty obvious from a picture of  Jennifer Aniston  that she ain't  Laotian . -- George  20:00, 2 January 2006 (UTC)           Nice reply, although I didn't get all of itÂ :) .

Hmm...I would be extremely surprised if someone quoted an exact number for you here. There really isn't a ""perfect"" weight for this sort of stuff. There are lots of other things that go into being a great athlete other than being physically fit. Are you asking instead, for a list of statistics somewhere which describes the physical stature of boxers in your height categorization, and which also comes with a proper statistical interpretation? -- HappyCamper  06:05, 3 January 2006 (UTC)     Which are the other things than physical fitness for perfect boxer and also i would like to know the range of weight to my mentioned height?     According to  these tables on Body Mass indices  your ideal weight would lie between 124 and 155 pounds (assuming you are male). Since you're a boxer, I would recommend going with the higher end of this estimate to allow some weight for your muscles. I wouldn't worry about your weight too much unless your weight goes above 186 pounds which is considered obese. The main thing is that you eat enough and get yourself enough calories so you have enough energy for boxing. Trying to lose weight often causes adverse effects. Please see  Body mass index  for more information on how I calculated this. -  Mgm | (talk)  10:36, 3 January 2006 (UTC)       [ edit ]   Faeries   Has Brian Froud, author of 'Fearies' seen a fearie?

See  this article  for details.  thejabberwock  02:02, 4 January 2006 (UTC)                   There's a Dutch word, 'bunkeren', which my dictionary translates as 'stuff oneself' (ie with food). But there's another Dutch meaning, namely to stock up on something of which one thinks there might be a shortage in the near future, such as when there is a war threat. But if enough people do it, it might become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Which was a major reason for the long lines in Russia - as soon as something became available in a shop, people would buy it 'just in case'. Thus causing eternal shortages and lines whenever something becomes available again - etc. I believe this has long been a Russian 'tradition', from before the USSR. Is this true?

It looks like an American number, but I don't think it is  Sceptr e   ( Talk )  13:43, 3 January 2006 (UTC)     Try  here  or  here .  CambridgeBayWeather   (Talk)  14:13, 3 January 2006 (UTC)   Well, as  list of country calling codes  says, anything starting with +1 sounds like an international reference to the  North American Numbering Plan , but according to  this site  233 is not currently an area code in the U.S. or Canada. So perhaps there was an error in communicating the number.  Sharkford  21:13, 3 January 2006 (UTC)           The reports under  this page on the North American Numbering Plan Administration web site  confirm that there is no area code 233, and no current plan to introduce one either. So +1233 is defintely wrong. If this was found in some material written in English, my guess is that this is supposed to be the area code for  Ashford, Kent , and its surrounding area in southeast  England . Locally that would be written 01233; in international dialing it would be +44 1233; and you can imagine someone who didn't understand that the country code (44) was required might get it wrong when converting the one to the other.   Say, that's interesting -- Wikipedia's article for Ashford says the area code is 01622, which is actually for the nearby town of  Maidstone  according to  British Telecom 's web site and  this other one I checked . I'll fix it now. --  66.96.28.244  21:47, 3 January 2006 (UTC)               Oh, after writing that, I wondered if 233 might simply be a mistake for 223. But the NANPA web site says there is no 223 in North America either. Another possibility is that 1233 is not an area code (or country code and area code) at all, but a dialing code within some system. However, maybe the context makes that impossible. --  66.96.28.244  21:53, 3 January 2006 (UTC)           [ edit ]   Medical diagnosis   posted in header by mistake --  Ec5618  15:05, 3 January 2006 (UTC)  good morning.i was wondering if there is anyone who could share thoughts about this..that is my preliminary diagnosis.i'm frightened.i'm looking for answers to a concrete,definable answer to my myriad of symptoms:dizziness intermittently,ataxia,freezing cold then very warm.perepheral vasccular changes.i'm walking with a cane.seeing a physical therapist 3 times a week for strengthening,as iam weak for the last 2 months.please help if you can.happy new year to all,margi     If you are using the word  ataxia  the way doctors use it, and it is objectively demonstrable (rather than something you just ""feel""), a  neurologist  should be able to make a definitive diagnosis for you.

What is the world's most consumed fruit? This question was asked at my local pub quiz and I thought the answer was banana (which I understood to be the item most sold in UK supermarkets), but I was told that the correct answer was in fact the tomato. A friend of mine was then asked the same question in a quiz later that week, and answered tomato thinking this was correct, but was told that the correct answer was the grape! In an attempt to end the confusion over this question, I looked to the humble internet, only to find a huge disparity over claims to the world's most consumed fruit. There seems to be an almost even split between sites claiming that the mango and banana are the most consumed fruit, but there are various other claims around. Does anyone have a definitive answer to this question, or perhaps you happen to have some statistics on the matter? Any help would be most appreciated, thank you!     It's very difficult to definitively quantify such a question. I imagine most estimates would be based on import/export or agriculture figures, which can vary by country and be inaccurately recorded or compiled. Also, someone in a country may consider  their  country's most popular fruit to be the  world's  most popular fruit, which may not be the case. Another complication is that the tomato, which strictly speaking is a fruit, is often considered a vegetable and some estimates may hence disregard it. Some Google searching produced wildly varying results as you'd expect:  [4]  (banana);  [5]  (tomato, banana, apple, orange, watermelon) - this site does have statistics but no source;  [6]  (apple, oranges, banana);  [7]  (mangoes). Never heard of the grape being that popular - they can be quite difficult to grow as well. Maybe that source was using number of grapes rather than weight of fruit consumed! -- Canley  01:01, 4 January 2006 (UTC)       There's also no indication of whether the fruit is consumed whole or in a product. If you count ketchup, marinara sauce, salsa, and other tomato products, that greatly changes the number of tomatoes consumed.  66.47.17.237  16:41, 4 January 2006 (UTC)TheSPY       Those well known botanists, the US Supreme Court, have established that a tomato is not a fruit, but a vegetable, in the case of  Nix v.

Most things that would keep you from being employed are fixable, so fix them and find a way to demonstrate that you have the work ethic and skills the employer is looking for. If you can demonstrate to an employer that you can make more money for them than you cost in pay, benefits, etc, then they will usually hire you, and if not, someone else will. The key is if you really can demonstrate it so find some way to do that, even if it is volunteer work (as mentioned above) while you sqeak by wherever you're living and eating even if it is a homeless shelter. So if you're persistent enough you'll be fine. If it's a criminal record that is the problem, that may be a little tougher, but that's the breaks, and it's still possible. There are generally government programs for helping people get jobs, and some charity options, so go to a local library and do some research on those until you find someone that can help you. If people reallize you are serious about helping yourself, they will go out of their way to help you. -  Taxman   Talk  15:38, 4 January 2006 (UTC)               It's unfair, but some people tend to be unemployed, because they are still studying and because the company can hire a younger person, which costs them less money.

You could then do volunteer work, such as working on Wikipedia (if you have knowledge that is still lacking). Probably not what you were asking for, but, depending on your country's social security and your material needs, a viable option. And nothing to be ashamed of, as long as you make yourself useful. But maybe this is too much of a Dutch perspective.

That is, so that they don't miss any holiday time because a weekend and a holiday coincide?  Oskar  21:29, 3 January 2006 (UTC)     Yes, typically a Monday is given off when a holiday falls on a Sunday and a Friday is given off when a holiday falls on Saturday.  StuRat  21:37, 3 January 2006 (UTC)    For example, this year January 2 was a legal holiday because January 1,  New Year's Day , was a Sunday. -- Maxamegalon2000  05:27, 4 January 2006 (UTC)                   Its the same in Australia too-- Ali K  05:36, 4 January 2006 (UTC)                           It depends to a degree. On Federal Holidays, which are nationally recongnized holidays, the answer is yes, people typically get another day off of work. In the case of lesser known holidays or relegious holidays, that may not nessicarily be the case; for instance, Easter always falls on a Sunday, but most workers do not get monday off, and some public and private schools will not take extra days off if holidays such as Presidents Day and Martin Luther King Day fall over the weekend.  TomStar81                               To clarify on the Australia thing - it is generally the Monday which is the holiday, whether the public holiday is a Saturday or a Sunday. If Christmas day is the Saturday and Boxing Day the Sunday, both Monday 27th and Tuesday 28th are given as days off. --  Chuq  12:37, 7 January 2006 (UTC)                   [ edit ]   music uploading in canada   i am canadian, and i am a heavy user of music sharing. i upload a large amount (mostly underground downloadable music) on p2p networks, if i were to share copyrighted music from american and canadian artists would there be a chance of me getting caught? because i've read on several news websites that it is legal to download material in canada. so should i cut down on the uploading? or is there no danger?

I see ever-increasing topics covered in all three series, and the ones I've read seem pretty good at explaining the basics and are long enough to satisfy one's curiosity. Of course, nothing beats Wikipedia     It depends on the subject matter, I would guess, but from personal experience, the ""...For Dummies"" series isn't terrible. The one on  golf  was actually very good, IMO, as was the one on  HTML . They really are designed for someone who knows absolutely nothing or nearly nothing about the subject; I picked up the one on  American football  and there was nearly nothing new to learn from it. If you're looking for a free alternative to these sorts of books, you might try  Wikibooks ...  ;-)   android 79  01:54, 4 January 2006 (UTC)       These books are terrific, not because they go back to the very beginning and assume you know nothing, but because they are written simply and clearly, with communication being their first priority, not maintaining the elitism that language can automatically provide for an ""in"" group. If textbooks were all written like this, more people would actually learn something in school. I can't vouch for the K*I*S*S books, but I will say the the Dummies series and the Complte Idiots series are quite terrific.  Mitchell k dwyer  02:34, 4 January 2006 (UTC)       I've always found the For Dummies books very good, mostly I've seen ones on computing but others on non-tecchy subjects have been good too. On computing again, SAMS guides seem very good. However, I'd strongly recommend that before buying any individual book checking the feedback at Amazon and/or visiting some websites on the subject and seeing if they review the book. -- bodnotbod  00:17, 12 January 2006 (UTC)       [ edit ]   Closing a business   Where do I look to find out how to close a business without getting sued by the employees?

If you were to fire them, they could sue you for breech of contract no matter what. However, offering a few months extra pay may convince some to leave of their own free will. Still, the lawyer suggestion is the best, though. Asking complete strangers for legal advice is not really a good idea. -  131.211.210.11  09:34, 4 January 2006 (UTC)     You need to have a lawyer, or legal expert check the law in your geography. Many states in the USA, for example, require that you give 3 months notice, or some similar time period, before closing your doors, because it is going to have a major impact on the taxes collected, and money to budget to pay unemployment compensation to your former employees.  User:AlMac | (talk)  10:58, 4 January 2006 (UTC)   Why would you worry about getting sued?

Who would they have played, and could this happen today?     If I'm reading correctly, the site actually states that one game in 1938 was played at a neutral site. Except for the  Super Bowl  and the preseason  Pro Football Hall of Fame Game , games are never scheduled for neutral sites anymore, although I think some get moved occassionally to escape various natural disasters. As for playing games that are not official NFL games, this would never ever happen today, probably for various contract reasons. -- Maxamegalon2000  06:19, 4 January 2006 (UTC)    If I had to venture a guess, I'd say they probably played the  Chicago Bears .

Dismas | (talk)  06:49, 4 January 2006 (UTC)    The neutral-site game was a Sept. 29, 1938 contest against the Chicago Cardinals in Buffalo. Oddly, the teams had met four days earlier in Milwaukee. It's no surprise they moved a Cardinals game, since the Cards got poor attendance in Chicago. Perhaps they scheduled the game that way so the teams could save money by traveling together. --  Mwalcoff  01:42, 5 January 2006 (UTC)               [ edit ]   exploration   IS there any land unexlored or any region where humans are still living in ancient old age condition with isolated comunity?

Depends on how isolated you mean. In Borneo the  Dayaks  are well accustomed to western stuff, although they don't always adopt it (good on 'm). However, the  Penan  are traditionally hunters/gatherers and although they are receiving incentives to settle down, some will still be living traditionally (don't know how many, though).

I don't know about hover cars, but the  Moller Skycar  may go into production at some point. A ""hover car"" that floats above the ground using fans or jets is probably unlikely, because it would take too much energy to keep the car hovering.  Rhobite  20:18, 4 January 2006 (UTC)           The Moller Skycar has been ""about to go into production"" for decades. As far as something that actually worked goes, there was the  Williams X-Jet , which actually flew back in the 1980's. In any case, the FAA and public liability laws nearly killed off conventional private planes 20 years ago, and the airlines are already beginning to complain about the safety risks the  VLJ  will pose to airliners. The professionals like having the air to themselves as much as possible.-- Robert Merkel  22:47, 4 January 2006 (UTC)                   Personal flying vehicles for all may never happen, since the risks would be so great. A car that stalls and won't restart usually just blocks traffic, while a plane that stalls and won't restart often gets people killed. A hovercraft which is only a foot above the ground poses less of a risk, but still more than a car. The strong wind blowing out from around the skirt also would be quite annoying to pedestrians and would effect other hovercrafts nearby, and steering is not as precise in a hovercraft, necessitating wider lanes to prevent collisions. The noise level would also be unacceptable. So, I also doubt if we will ever have hovercrafts for everyone. Electric cars for everyone does seem like a possibility, once the technology is improved.  StuRat  00:04, 5 January 2006 (UTC)                           Moving cars also have a tendency to kill people (close to 30 million by now I believe - that's world war scale) and that hasn't caused any major uproar yet, as far as I know (alas). If you mean futuristic  hovercars , well, they're as yet futuristicÂ :) . But a  hovercraft  is also a hovercar. It happens to be used on water, but can also be used on land (or any other relatively flat surface). Just see the opening scenes of  Die another day . StuRat already beat me to mentioning the disadvantages of land use for the general public. And similar disadvantages go for hovering with a (different sort of) jet stream.   Another option might be an adaption of  magnetic rail . But that would require a complete change of infrastructure, so it's not likely to get used for anything but public transport over much used routes. The photo at  Arotrain , however, looks suspiciously like a car. And futuristic (does it use jet propulsion?).   Or did you have a specific technology in mind?

And I don't think there's any ""an internal bodily system to discourage the taste or thought of eating human meat."" I guess it's a matter of culture. I have the same repulsion and disgust for eating any kind of meat.  deeptrivia  ( talk ) 05:09, 5 January 2006 (UTC)                                   Why would there be an 'internal bodily system' to discourage eating human meat? One reason would be that the closer the animal you eat is to you, the greater the chances that any disease it has will be contagious to you. And that would especially go for human meat. Indeed, there is a disease one can only get from eating human brains (some Papuas still get that disease occasionally, I've heard....). But that should then discourage us eating any meat that is close to us, like pigs or monkeys. I tried a monkey once and my travelling companion pointed out to me that that was probably the closest we'd ever get to eating human meat. Tasted ok, though (a bit stringy). But eating human flesh can also be a life saver. In mankind's history, we've mostly been hunters/gatherers, living in small bands. When such a group was going through a difficult period food-wise, I suppose they ate each other (first the dead and then the weak?). And it seems to me that that option is a stronger advantage than the disadvantage of the risk of infection. There might be some built-in mechanism to prevent us eating meat that shows signs of disease, though. Oh, but I believe meat eaters don't eat meat eaters. We're omnivores, though.  DirkvdM  08:52, 5 January 2006 (UTC)                                           There are often bodily systems put in place as 7121989 stated which prevent humans harming each other out of cause. This was put in place long ago through evolution to ensure no self-harm to a species, so that it be preserved. This is evident in many animals and a human example is the 'wrongness' of murder and the human guilt that can occur after murder eg. macbeth syndrome etc. Serial killers suffer from a distinct lack of this sympathy and there is also a reverse an urge for murder in cold blood.                           How something tastest is entirely subjective, so even if you do get an answer, you may not agree with it (assuming you ever tasted to compare). -  Mgm | (talk)  09:49, 5 January 2006 (UTC)1     Allow me to point you in the direction of  ManBeef.com .

I have a ""need"" to exert pressure on my hands and feet, especially in the evening before I go to sleep. I usually put my hand into a fist and squeeze it between the bed and wall, or between the mattresses. I also tend to push my feet between couch cushions or under the body of my partner. This is a behavior I have had since childhood. Is there a name for this?   This does not fit the diagnostic criteria for  obsessive-compulsive disorder . It does remind me of a similar and fairly widespread phenomenon: that of hugging or squeezing or immobilizing for comfort or calming. See  hug machine  for a more extreme example of this.  alteripse  03:22, 5 January 2006 (UTC)     I vaguely remember once hearing that such squeezing reminds one of being in the womb.   The following is a bit off-topic, but could still be helpful. At  Rainbow Gatherings  there is a custom to hug one another, which is quite a nice feeling once you give into it. You may have to break some psychological barrier and maybe that itself gives the liberating sensation. But my guess it has indeed to do with bodily contact. The squeeze is quite important. I've seen a couple hug tightly for a few minutes and break out in tears. It can be quite powerful. There's even a 'hug police' that looks around for people who feel glum, upon which they hug them to cheer them up. And I once heard of someone breaking up a fight by hugging one of the fighters. Of course that person was thus immobilised and the other may have felt ashamed to take advantage of the situation. Or maybe they were so flabbergasted they forgot about the fight.Â :)  DirkvdM  09:07, 5 January 2006 (UTC)       You could have  Restless legs syndrome .

However, with this, you only see heat transmitted by the bodies. If you want to see in 'normal light', that light would have to reflect off the body and then pass through the clothes. But then you wouldn't need special goggles or whatever. Of course, there's also that picture of Diana in a see-through dress, but that requires special clothing on the part of the 'victim' (also, it was just a silhouette). And that is one of the prerequisites. The other is the light being strong enough. In other words, this can't be done secretly. Or is there a wavelength that would pass through clothes but get reflected off skin? The result would be black and white, though (or whatever monochromatic colour you want to give it).

These are reflected back into the machine, which can then generate a 3D image of every layer of the subject.  s murray inch e ster ( User ), ( Talk )  18:58, 5 January 2006 (UTC)                           Wouldn't that require much (much much) stronger radiation than a 'normal' (silhouette) x-ray image?

DirkvdM  08:34, 6 January 2006 (UTC)                                   It actually requires weaker x-rays; normal x-rays need to be so strong that they can pass right through your muscle and fatty tissue, while backscatter needs weaker x-rays; the x-rays are bounced back harmlessly off the skin.  s murray inch e ster ( User ), ( Talk )  17:08, 6 January 2006 (UTC)                       [ edit ]   Any way to ""break"" the password of a RAR file?   Is there any way to extract files from a passworded RAR file (in this case, various .r01, r.02 files, etc) without the password?     It's rather difficult. As our article on  RAR  notes, strong encryption is used, so the only feasible attack is a dictionary attack (essentially, getting a computer to guess the password). If a good password has been chosen, you won't be able to read the files. Elcomsoft sells  software  for this purpose; it wouldn't be hard to write an open source version but it'll be much easier to just pay the money to buy the software (though they do have a free 30-day trial). -- Robert Merkel  09:56, 5 January 2006 (UTC)       Many uploaders include the password in the .nfo file posted with the rars.

Is there really enough work to keep the crew fully occupied? Or do they just sit there and drink coffee? -- Shantavira  14:20, 5 January 2006 (UTC)   I would imagine the co-pilot takes over while the pilot naps, but that's just a guess.  Taiq  14:21, 5 January 2006 (UTC)     On long haul flights, there is more than one set of crew, and they rotate. There'd be up to 3 co-pilots. There is only one captain / pilot, who must be at the stick for take-off and landing, and so for a lot of the cruising at altitude, two of the co-pilots wil be flying the plane.  Proto Â  t Â  c  14:36, 5 January 2006 (UTC)           Ok, but wouldn't they just fly on auto-pilot? -- Shantavira  14:52, 5 January 2006 (UTC)                   Yes, but they still have to be there, in case anything goes wrong.  Proto Â  t Â  c  14:57, 5 January 2006 (UTC)                           So my original questions stand. -- Shantavira  16:02, 5 January 2006 (UTC)                                   As does my answer - the autopilot handles the flying once the plane has reached cruising altitude, but at all times there needs to be two people capable of piloting the plane in the cockpit, on duty. On a long haul flight, there are more than two on the plane, and they rotate. There is always plenty to keep the flight crew occupied, even when autopilot is engaged; autopilots are not that clever, and will only keep the plane moving in a straight line at a set height - any and all course changes must be carried out by the flight crew. And those changes take place a lot, due to weather conditions, turbulence, etc. They have to remain in contact with various air traffic controls, watch out for other planes, monitor the status of the plane itself, and so on.  Proto Â  t Â  c  16:13, 5 January 2006 (UTC)                                           Thanks Proto, that is reassuring. -- Shantavira  16:34, 5 January 2006 (UTC)                           I imagine you're asking partially because you feel horribly lethargic and distracted after even a medium-haul flight, and you can't imagine doing something important like flying an aircraft. Pilots don't, really, feel any worse than you'd feel after a long day at the office. One reason is, as you say, that they have stuff to do. But another reason is that they're getting oxygen-enriched air; although the air pressure in the cockpit is the same as in the rest of the aircraft (which is around 80% of stp) the partial pressure of oxygen is about the same as at stp. So while you're back in cattle class with mild oxygen deprivation, they're fine up at the pointy end. How, you might ask, do the cabin staff cope, particularly given that they're doing aerobic exercise while you're just sitting there like a pudding? Partially they're used to it (which I guess means that they've got more red blood cells than they would do otherwise), partially they can get a little shot of oxygen from a mask in the galley, and partially they don't - I've been on several flights (well, two, I think) where a member of cabinstaff has fainted. Proto's sleeping-and-turn-taking answer works fine for commercial aircraft, but it's harder to do for long-haul military aircraft such as the  B-2 Spirit  - for that they still try to sleep, but eventually they break out the  Dextroamphetamine .

What's wrong?  Taiq  14:23, 5 January 2006 (UTC)     You'd want all signatures to use the same time zone, so that when reading a conversation you can know the order of things.  Notinasnaid  16:20, 5 January 2006 (UTC)           The obvious follow-up to that one, is, of course, ""Then why can't that common timezone be  my  timezone?"". The answer, is, of course, that the WP database format really isn't made for that (remember, you aren't the only WP user). After signing with your signature (~~~~), they are immediately exchanged with the current date and time, and are stored in the database at pure ASCII text. Fixing old signatures basically is impossible. What would be feasible though, is to make future time stamps dynamically recomputed to match the timezone of choice of the user. I don't suppose this is high on the developers' to-do-list, though, and it would probably eat some server performance as well.

Burning merely changes the matter from one form into another. See  Law of conservation of matter . -- Shantavira  16:15, 5 January 2006 (UTC)           In conjunction with the above, the matter remains (for all practical intents and purposes) as part of the closed Earth system. Smoke does not appreciably escape into interplanetary space.  Tides , however, do effect a slowing of the Earth's rotation.   Lomn  |  Talk  /  RfC  16:20, 5 January 2006 (UTC)                   The only way a chemical reaction could change the mass of the Earth is if a light gas, like hydrogen or helium gas, was produced. Such gases move to the upper atmosphere, where the force of gravity is less, then get blown into space by the solar wind or their own thermal energy. Nuclear reactions, on the other hand, directly reduce the mass of the elements undergoing fusion or fission, by changing some of that mass into energy. However, the amount of mass converted to energy is insignificant as compared with the total mass of Earth.  StuRat  21:05, 5 January 2006 (UTC)                           That last point is about a mistaken assumption I've often heard people make in various reasonings.  Earth 's radius is roughly 6000 km.  Earth's atmosphere  is a few hundred km thick if you stretch the term. But only 100 km up is already almost vacuum. And 50% of the mass of the atmosphere is located in the bottom 5 km. That's just 1/1000 of Earth's radius. But this is linear and the Earth is three dimensional, so this has to be raised to the power 3, so that's one billionth of the volume (times two, because we're talking about 50% of the atmosphere, but that's nitpicking, relatively speaking). Add to that that the atmosphere is gas and the Earth is solid mass and you have to conclude that the atmosphere is a flimsy, almost negligible, layer from Earth's perspective (if the Earth would have a perspectiveÂ :) ).  DirkvdM  09:12, 6 January 2006 (UTC)                   Days are getting longer by about 1.5 microseconds per year, but this is due to the Moon (see  tidal acceleration ). This might explain why there are now fewer days in a year than there used to be. The ""400 days"" comes from palaeontological observations ( explained here ). To go from 400 days to 365 days at 1.5 us per year would take 2 trillion years, which is much longer than the age of the Earth. Therefore the rate of slowing must have been much greater in the planet's youth, probably because the Moon was closer to the Earth. None of this has anything to do with the burning of fossil fuels. Mankind doesn't yet have the power to ruin the solar system (but we're working on it). -- Heron  12:34, 7 January 2006 (UTC)       The Earth actualy keep getting heavier.

Yes, I am disgusted with it, as would be many others. I suspect legal and extralegal actions might be taken against you if you make such a game. In the US, for example, there is a law against profitting from a criminal act, which this seems to be. You could also be sued by the families of individual victims, who would argue that you are profiting from the deaths of their loved ones, without their permission, and thus owe them money.  StuRat  22:36, 5 January 2006 (UTC)           IANAL, but profiting from a criminal act isn't federal law but state law and where it is, it applies only to the person(s)  convicted  of the crime. And I doubt very much you'd get any money in a civil case. Do I have to pay the Kennedys if I write a book on the JFK assassination? I think not. It doesn't change the fact that it's a highly insensitive and stupid thing to do. But stupidity isn't illegal - Freedom of speech is more important than hurt feelings. Anyway.. the author should perhaps also think less about his 'storyline' and concern himself more about what makes a good game.

If you do make the game, though, you should certainly talk to a lawyer about it. Regardless of the legalities, I doubt it would sell very well. It's a sensitive topic.

As far as extralegal methods, you might find your company, or any company associated with the sale of such a game, is the target of a boycott. You might also be threatened physically by angry family members of victims. If you want to make a 9-11 video game, make it based on stopping the terrorists. You could be an air marshall on one of the planes, for example. This would still upset many people, but not to the extent of taking the side of the terrorists would. If you set it in the future, and maybe call it Air Marshall, then you might have a good seller that doesn't anger people so much.

(If anyone notices.) But the idea in itself is probably protected under free speech rights. In the end, it probably depends on how you treat the case. Will you be sensitive? Will you glorify or trivialise the attacks? What choices will the player have? What rewards? There have been plenty of fictional works focusing on crimes from the viewpoint of the perpetrators. e.g.  [12] ,  [13] , so there is nothing intrinsically wrong with it. -- Fangz  00:25, 7 January 2006 (UTC)           Something else you may want to consider as well: The USA PATRIOT ACT could be used against you to investigate your personal/profesional history, along the money trail that such a game may or may not bring in. If the United States Government deems the game to be terrorist supportive they may make a preemptive move to sieze the game before you have a chance to do anything with it. Additionally, the ESRB will rate your game according to several criteria, if you end up with a game rating of Mature (M) or Adult Only (AO) the number of stores that will consider carrying your product will nosedive faster than a speeding bullet. Those still interested in your game at that point would probably be required to show ID when they go to buy or rent it. Just throwing that out their. (And for the record, I am  very  distugusted with the concept).  TomStar81  00:59, 7 January 2006 (UTC)         Also, the US Congress would likely ban pro-terrorist video games by passing laws. I doubt if the now quite conservative US Supreme Court would overturn such laws in the current climate.  StuRat  01:40, 7 January 2006 (UTC)     And at the end of it all, you'll surely become famous.  deeptrivia  ( talk ) 06:07, 7 January 2006 (UTC)     All of the above responses seem to be about the US. In other countries 1) law suits aren't nearly as common as in the US (it seems half the world's lawyers live in the US) and 2) there isn't quite as strong a sentiment about the attacks and there are probably loads of people who would want to play such a game. After all there are loads of people who hate the US sufficiently for this. So you may be out of luck in the US, but the rest of the world is still quite a considerable market, to put it mildlyÂ :) . That's the power of information; distribution is so cheap the world is your oyster. Having said that, I like neither video games nor violence (nor oysters, for that matterÂ :) ). That's violence of any kind, real, fake, terrorist or 'official' military. So I'll certainly not be a customer.   By the way, can the US supreme court overrule government laws? Isn't that in violation of the  trias politica , supposedly one of the cornerstones of modern western societies? Then again, I recently realised that in the Netherlands executive power and legislative power overlap. What's next?  DirkvdM  08:38, 7 January 2006 (UTC)     Yes, the supreme court can do that. For congress to get around that little road block they can add an ammendment to the US Constitution; since the Constitution is the supreme law of the United States it can not be overuled without an ammendment to that effect. A really good example of this is the 18th ammendment, which could only be overuled by adding the 21st ammendment.  TomStar81     Acclaim Entertainment  tried to sell their games using publicity stunts. They went bust.  Gdr  16:20, 7 January 2006 (UTC)   It's a good thing the Supreme Court can do that, or Bush would do even more damage than he already does. (unless of course his appointees make the court a reflection of him). Your game doesn't disgust me, but I won't be a customer, I love video games (even violent ones, though I'm not a fan of actual violence) but that one doesn't sound like it's down my alley.  Yeltensic42.618   ambition makes you   look pretty ugly  21:52, 7 January 2006 (UTC)     So it's even worse, the Supreme Court can even amend the constitution! I suppose this makes sense where there is just one person in power. But not from a perspective of the Netherlands, where a parliament off 225 people have to agree to a change in the constitution over two consecutive terms of government.  DirkvdM  08:25, 8 January 2006 (UTC)    An amendment requires the approval of two-thirds of each house in Congress and three-quarters of state legislatures (I  think  those are the right numbers). The Supreme Court doesn't decide that, they can only declare laws unconstitutional according to how the Constitution already is.  Yeltensic42.618   ambition makes you   look pretty ugly  00:00, 9 January 2006 (UTC)    Exactly. The supreme court is bound by the US constitution, they can not overule the constitution because they are sworn to defend it. This goes back to the checks and balances: Congressional laws can be overturned by the US Supreme Court; however Congress check against the supreme court is the ability to ammend th US Constitution to reflect the laws they wish the United States to uphold. The supreme court is powerless to stop such a process, and when a law becomes an ammendment the supreme court must uphold that ammendment.  TomStar81  01:15, 9 January 2006 (UTC)           Several years ago I played  Operation Olympic (game)  which was the secret code name for the  Allies  plan to invade  Japan  at the end of  WW II , when development of  Nuclear weapons  was even more so a top secret. If you played the game, and the result was that 1 million GI's got killed, then the result was considered consistent with historical expectations. If less than 1 million GI's got killed, then the American side had won, because the American player had done a better job than the historical plan expected. If more than 1 million GI's got killed, then the Japanese side had won. It was a foregone conclusion that Japan would be defeated. The point of the game was to maximize or minimuze Allied casualties.    Now such a game is playable and marketable, when the pain of memories of the time has sufficiently faded from the consiousness of the people who lived through the reality, and that of their descendents. I dare say a game about the Holocaust would not yet fly, because that pain was so great that it will be felt for many generations to come. Games about what went on in the  Korean War  might fly, but I think the  Vietnam War  was too recent. You have to weigh how great the pain and upheaval of an event was in history, and how long ago, before it is grist for some game design. I think with 9/11 we need to wait 200 years before it is a safe topic for a game.       User:AlMac | (talk)  01:30, 9 January 2006 (UTC)               There've been  many Vietnam games  already, some of which were published while the war was still going on. The problem with a 9/11 game isn't the recency, but that so many people would consider it to be in very bad taste. The First Amendment doesn't protect against economic censorship. As others have noted, you couldn't find investors, distributors, etc. You might move a few copies as shareware to the kind of people who, immediately after 9/11, participated in betting pools about what the final casualty total would be. If you're moved to do a game about a surprise attack, though, try something like  Washington's crossing of the Delaware . If you want the subject to be an attack on civilians, consider  Wounded Knee Massacre . As for the Holocaust, again I don't think it's the recency, but rather the idea of having a player in the role of committing genocide. You could certainly do a game in which the player leads a team of commandos trying to liberate the inmates of a concentration camp.  JamesMLane  03:14, 10 January 2006 (UTC)             I would like to see you make this game just to see what would happen.

I have only had my driver's license for three-four months now, and only had my own car for about two. When driving uphill at approx. 60 km/h (~40 mph) which gear is the most efficient (as in fuel consumption) and which induces the least wear on the engine of 3rd and 4th, where the engine's RPM is at about 2500 and 1500 respectively?   The reason I'm wondering is that I want to be an efficient driver, using the least amounts of fuel possible when driving, but I don't know which uses more fuel. You would immediately think that having a lower RPM would use less fuel, as the engine has to do fewer rounds, where each round uses fuel, but on the other hand, when the RPM is higher, the engine doesn't have to put in as much fuel per round to keep the car moving, and my car has electronic fuel injection, so when it has no resistance (as when taking the foot off the throttle during downhill travel) it uses very little fuel at all. It's also interesting to know which causes the most wear on the engine, as, although it's not too important, avoiding unnecessary wear is also a good thing.   DarkPhoenix  23:51, 5 January 2006 (UTC)     In practice, in a normal car, you'd either be in third or fourth - third for a steeper hill, fourth for a gentle one. You really shouldn't worry one iota about engine wear, as it is highly unlikely you will ever wear out an engine - really the only dramatic thing that ever happens to most car's engines during a normal lifespan is the timing belt snapping, and only a preventative replacement will make any difference to that. Basing gear selection on efficiency or engine-wear is a bad idea - use the safest gear which gives you the control you need for those circumstances. If you want to be efficient, accelerate moderately, don't drive too fast, and keep your car well maintained and the suspension and tires in good condition. --  Finlay McWalter  |  Talk  00:14, 6 January 2006 (UTC)           OK, so I know about the accelerate moderately, drive at sensible speeds and keeping my car maintained is the best way. However, disregard that for a second, and just answer the first part of the question with no regard to my reasoning in the second paragraph. I'm not even sure why I added that, as it really doesn't help any.  DarkPhoenix  00:38, 6 January 2006 (UTC)       If you want to stay cool by driving with windows open, that air drag contributes to more fuel consumption. Are you better off using the car's air conditioner? Well if your # 1 priority is lowest fuel consumption, then drive with air conditioner off, and windows closed. Me, I drive with windows open in stop and go driving, and airconditioner on when I drive the limited access highways, because my personal comfort is more important to me than preserving fuel consumption.   You also need to keep the vehicle in good running condition. The owner's mannual may suggest an oil change every 7 or 8 thousand miles. But if you do this every 2 or 3 thousand miles, it is a lot better for the long life of the engine. Check into tips like that. What can you do to care for the car that will also translate into long life and low maintenance costs. My personal car has 300,000 miles on it and is 25 years old, and still running fine, because I take good care of it, better than what the owner's manual calls for.

StuRat  03:09, 6 January 2006 (UTC)       Depending on how weak her legs are, I suggest swimming, starting with floatation assistance, so if she not doing anything, in the water, she not sinkng. I think swimming is a great form of exercise, that not put great strain on us, learn different kinds of swimming that put different stresses on various limbs. Over time, on a regular schedule of using a swimming pool, try to do more laps than on prior visits.  User:AlMac | (talk)  06:53, 7 January 2006 (UTC)       Of course, if there's a particular medical issue, see a doctor first. That said, the quickest way to fix the problem would be fairly heavy weightlifting using motions like squats and leg presses. try this url: http://exrx.net/Lists/Directory.html  to find a good exercise for the muscles she wants to target, and just make sure the exercise is done properly to prevent injury. I realize a 12 year old girl is not the demographic you traditionally think of powerlifting, but that's the best way to get results. I had weak hip muscles for years and it affected my balance pretty severely, 3 weeks of squats and deadlifts fixed the problem. Pick exercises that make use of dumbbells rather than big barbells, she won't need much weight anyway and dumbbells are easier to manage. -- Osbojos  15:54, 13 January 2006 (UTC)           I thought weight training was bad for children.. is that an urban myth?

Being Dutch, I first learned about the variomatic. Only later I learned about other automatic gears and in comparison I thought the idea was really silly; to have a sort of handgear that shifts automatically. Isn't a variomatic much more logical and efficient? You're always in precisely the right gear. So why did it disappear? Apparently they were banned from formula 1 racing because they gave an 'unfair advantage'. What the fuck? And in the backward racing contests that were held in the Netherlands a while back they were in their own class because the gears work in reverse as well (another 'unfair advantage'). I now read in the article that a new version is  continuously variable transmission  but that is in use in just a handful of cars (given the total amount of different car brands and makes). Why don't all cars have this? The only real disadvantage that is mentioned in the article is that it can only be used in lighter cars. But it's also used in Rovers and Volvo's, not really light cars. The other, perceived, disadvantage is actually an advantage (smoother operation). So isn't this a much more efficient transmission? And how does it perform when going up hill (considering the torque problem)?  DirkvdM  09:41, 6 January 2006 (UTC)         Yes   There're a fair few examples of better technology losing out to another product that just appeared more appealing to the publi perception,  Betamax  being the classic example. In this case, it's for the same reason that the figures on speedometers go beyond what the car is capable of performing - people want to feel like they have a powerful car. The old  variomatic  system didnt provide the jerks people associated with more powerful cars.   They were likely banned for the same reason most automatic systems were banned in formula one. People want to watch humans racing, not computers, and the FIA complied.   Car manufacturers are wary of stepping out of line to change industry standards to a system most people haven't heard of and a large number wouldn't care for, for fear of profit-loss (aside from Japanese manufacturers, most companies don't turn out large profits).   Yes, it is.   The system performs fairly well on gentler slopes, but it does struggle with the larger gradients. The drive-belt also wears out a lot faster.         Hope that helps  GeeJo   (t)   (c)      13:32, 6 January 2006 (UTC)     Now I wish I had numbered my questionsÂ :) . But if it's a more efficient gear then won't it save fuel and wouldn't that be a strong sales argument? Maybe not so much in the US, but in Europe fuel costs 3 to 4 times as much (don't know about elsewhere). Then again, in Europe handgears are much more popular than automatic gears, probably for the same reason as answer 2. I suppose the market tools (ie taxes) don't work here because of the status symbolism of cars. Maybe tougher laws would be in order. But then many wouldn't vote for a party that promotes that.

Speaking as a left-wing American Democrat, I support both the state of Isreal and a potential Palestinian state.  Brian Schlosser42  18:05, 6 January 2006 (UTC)           That is also a broad generalization, since most people in the pro-Palestinian camp also recognize Israel. -- BluePlatypus  19:10, 6 January 2006 (UTC)                   Because Israel is strong and Palestine is weak. Left-wingers support the underdog, right-wingers support the top-dog. Back in the 60s and 70s, when it was Israel v. the Arab states rather than Israel v. Palestinians, left-wing support for Israel (being the underdog) was much stronger.  Mark 1  19:26, 6 January 2006 (UTC)                       There's also some cold war history - Israel was an ally in the cold war, while there were socialist groups on the Palestinian side, and remains a military ally of the US. Also there's the religion-politics issue - some Christian groups believe that the rebuilding of the temple and reestablisment of the state of Israel are requirements for the Rapture, so supporting Israel may hasten the endtimes. These groups also tend to support right-wing politicians.  Guettarda  19:33, 6 January 2006 (UTC)                           Left-wingers tend to be idealists, thinking all people should be treated equally, including terrorists. They view them as poor, confused vicitms of society, who are not to blame for their actions. Right-wingers, on the other hand, see them as evil bastards who all should be killed. Hence left-wingers tend to support whichever side is using terrorists and right-wingers support the other side.  StuRat  19:36, 6 January 2006 (UTC)                                   StuRat, are you  trying  to start a flamewar? Anyway, I'm one leftwinger who sympathizes with neither side. It's nice that Israel is a democracy, but it should be treated as an embarrassment to American Jews the way it is now. They're all elbows, and while I don't want Israel to be wiped out I don't think the US should be as gung-ho to support them as they are. If anything the Palestinians living on Israeli soil should be offered full Israeli citizenship. I don't support the Palestinians either though -- I don't support terrorism.  Haikupoet  19:57, 6 January 2006 (UTC)                                           I think Isreal is doing the best they can with building a wall and unilaterally withdrawing from Gaza. They can't negotiate with the Palestinians, since any Palestinian who negotiates is seen as ""week"". A sizable portion of Palestinians want all Isrealis dead, and you can't negotiate with that, anyway.  StuRat  20:30, 6 January 2006 (UTC)                                           More oversimplified (and flamebait) nonsense. What about the Israeli terrorists such as  Irgun  and  Lehi ? Viewing one side as ""terrorists"" is not an informed and balanced viewpoint of the conflict. Besides which, it isn't a left-vs-right issue anyway: It's the  American  right-wing which is strongly pro-Israel. The right-wing parties in the rest of the democratic world are not much bigger supporters of Israel than the left-wing ones. Nor was right-or-left wing US policy pro-Israel the way it is today until the last 30 years. (post 6-day war.) -- BluePlatypus  22:25, 6 January 2006 (UTC)                                           When one side has overwhelmingly more terrorists than the other, including state support for suicide bombers, the right-wingers take the side with the fewer terrorists, while the left-wingers point to one or two counterexamples and say the two are ""morally equivalent"". Using such logic, the US may be judged to be morally equivalent to al Queada, since the US has had some domestic terrorists, such as in the Oklahoma City bombing.  StuRat  01:07, 7 January 2006 (UTC)                                                   One or two counterexamples? Let's talk  totals . Since Sept 2000, 123 Israeli and 704 Palestinian children have ben killed. There are overwhelmingly more Palestinian civilian casualties (not only among children). I don't believe in eye-for-an-eye mentality. Both sides share in the blame. But the fact that you apparently aren't prepared to accept that Israel has at least equal blame here either means that you are uninformed or devoid of basic compassion. Or are you really prepared to make the argument that Israeli children are ""more innocent"" than Palestinian ones? -- BluePlatypus  01:39, 7 January 2006 (UTC)                                                           The Palestinian children are more stupid perhaps, as when they throw stones at tanks, intermixed with armed gunmen firing at the tanks, instead of taking cover. Confronting armed troops instead of doing what they say results in most of those casualties, not suicide bombers against Palestinians. And yes, I think somebody throwing a stone is more guilty of inciting violence than somebody eating pizza at a restaurant.  StuRat  01:44, 7 January 2006 (UTC)                                   An interesting article:  [15]  -- Fangz  00:12, 7 January 2006 (UTC)           This is indeed an interesting question. As other comments have pointed out, it is not as simple as left vs. right. In the U.S., few people in the political mainstream are anti-Israel to the extent that many people in Europe are. But even within countries, there is a clear right-left division on the Israel issue. In America, publications like  The Progressive  and  The Nation  are pro-Palestinian, while much of the Christian Right is more Zionist than the Israelis themselves. In Norway, the conservative Progress Party is pro-Israel, while the Socialist Left is anti-Israel. You can see the same trends in Canada ( Stockwell Day  vs.  Svend Robinson ) or Britain ( David Cameron  vs.  George Galloway ).               I think Mark1 puts it pretty well. The Palestinians have successfully marketed themselves as the underdog. In the 1940s, when the fighting was seen as the Jews against the Arabs and the British Empire, the Left was very much in favor of Zionism. The recasting of the fight as Israelis vs.  Palestinians  switches David and Goliath. Now to some people, it's big, bad Israel against a poor, oppressed group. Of course, in actuality, the actors are still the same; only the names have changed.               StuRat also has a point about the way leftists see the world. There's a conservative taunt that when a liberal sees a mugging victim lying on the ground bleeding, the liberal says, ""Whoever did this must need help!"" There's a tendency among the Left to believe that if someone is resorting to crime or terror, he must be a victim of persecution. Thus, when a leftist sees an act of terrorism, he or she is likely to seek the so-called root causes and sympathize with the terrorists' people, if not the act of terrorism itself.               A corollary to this is the tendency of the Western Left to always side  against  the West in any skirmish between it and other peoples. Leftists cannot go back in time and stop their own country's offenses against the indigenous peoples of the world (African slavery, Indian wars, etc.), so they take out their frustration on American foreign policy and on Israel. The latter country can be perceived as an old-fashioned European colony carved out of land that should belong to a non-European people. Of course, the situation is far more complicated than that -- most Israeli Jews trace at least part of their immediate ancestry to the Muslim world, not to Europe, and they were more likely to come to Israel as refugees than as colonizers. But the Left doesn't have a real European colony (like the  Belgian Congo ) in existence nowadays to kick around instead.               The colonialism issue, real or imagined, is probably why leftists will focus on the human rights record of Israel rather than on the far worse records of countries like China, Russia, Burma and just about all of the Arab world.               I don't want to launch a flame war here, but I have to say that the Left's antipathy toward Israel does make for some strange bedfellows. I mean, Israel might not be the world's most progressive country on issues like women's rights or gay rights. But if I were someone like Svend Robinson -- an irreligious, gay social liberal -- I would think I'd feel much more at home in Tel-Aviv than in Ramallah. --  70.27.57.22  03:32, 7 January 2006 (UTC)               Another point to consider that ""pro-Israel"" and ""pro-Palestinian"" are like ""anti-American"" as highly misleading terms. Just because one might oppose the actions of the present Israeli government doesn't make you ""anti-Israel"" any more than disliking the current US President makes you anti-American. Calling somebody ""anti country X"" is a useful debating tactic but hardly realistic when often there are large minorities in the country concerned who feel the same way. -- Robert Merkel  06:32, 7 January 2006 (UTC)    I would think you can often distinquish between the two cases, such as protesters yelling ""Down with BushÂ !"" versus ""Death to AmericaÂ !"".  StuRat  07:37, 7 January 2006 (UTC)                       Also, anti-Israel doesn't necessarily mean pro-Palestine.   As someone who on average leans towards the left (though I'm certainly not leftwing out of principle), let me give my view, which, according to above reasoning, is more right-wing. At first, Israel was a bad thing because it robbed Palestinians of their land. Now, however, most Israelis are born in Israel and have as much right to live there as the Palestinians had (notice the past tense). The solution used to be simple, now I don't see one anymore and side with anyone who doesn't use violence (ie neither) or is the victim (ie both).             Also, note that, apart from the title, Mark1 and me, no-one speaks of  Palestine , but in stead of  Palestinians . Which can be seen a political statement in itself.  DirkvdM  09:25, 7 January 2006 (UTC)             Actually, come to think of it, when I was clearly anti-Israel I was pretty right-wing (I voted  VVD  then). I now blame that on teenage ignorance.Â :) But I've always remained a liberal in both the leftwing and rightwing sense of the word.  DirkvdM  11:34, 7 January 2006 (UTC)                 The Right is usually concerned with dealing with direct symptoms of social problems. When the worker complains of labour conditions, you fire him. When oil starts to run out, you put up prices, or make deals with dodgy people. When crime puts your country above others, you build more jails. When the continuing conflict claims more casualties, you escalate it.       The Left is opposed to  Israel's policies in the conflict , not to Israel itself. It's opposed, because the left percieves the actions has a continuous disregard of the lessons of history and which cannot create a stable and long term situation in the area. The left believes that it is possible to understand actions without justifying it. And the left believes that this can be done  as well as  fighting the symptoms, not 'instead' as some people think. The left does not believe that a conflict can be divided into two obvious sides, and that you need to support one, or the other.       And the left are the only people tackling and campaigning against human rights abuses in anywhere near a fair way. Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch etc are all leftist organisations. Who's actually doing the deals with China these days? Are they the leftists?-- Fangz  15:01, 7 January 2006 (UTC)           The only policy Israel could have which might stop suicide bombers would be if they all left Israel and gave the country to the Palestinians. I don't think they see that as much of an option.  StuRat  16:51, 7 January 2006 (UTC)                   Also, left wingers are typically more optimistic about humanity, and the eventual triumph of reason etc.-- Fangz  19:38, 8 January 2006 (UTC) +             I agree with what DirkvdM said up there about Israel and the Palestinians. Also, I think what's incredibly stupid and dangerous about both sides is using religion to justify that they should live there, especially when the land they're fighting over has no other real purpose. It would make a lot more sense for one side to just have their state somewhere else in the Middle East, it's not as if Israel is the only country there.  Yeltensic42.618   ambition makes you   look pretty ugly  22:38, 7 January 2006 (UTC)     Religion is rarely the real reason for wars. It's a war between peoples whose can most easily be distinguished through religion. And religion is also a way to get people to do weird stuff (with the promise of a reward in the afterlife). Likewise, in Ireland it is/was not about catholics and protestants but about Irish and English. And I believe even the crusades were not about religion but about encroaching eastern culture.

I plan to make several picnic tables using Pressure Treated Wood. Are there any special precautions I need to take in painting this wood? Thanks, WSC     Pressure treated wood contains low levels of toxic materials, including arsenic. In general, that shouldn't be a problem, but if you're planning on making tables that people will be eating off of, the arsenic could leach into the food and the utensils.

However, I would always seal the wood to prevent splinters. A very bad thing for picnic tables. -- Zeizmic  15:11, 7 January 2006 (UTC)        Pressure-treated wood is wet. It needs to dry and/or be sealed before paining. See  [17] . Also note that you need to use stainless steel or zinc coated nails, bolts and screws when building with pressure treated wood to prevent oxidation reactions (chemical rusting).

There most be holding tanks, but do they ever dump them while in-flight?     Yes, but not intentionally. I don't think they have a remote control opening device which would allow them to do so, even if they wanted to. However, the drain which is normally used to empty the tanks when on the ground sometimes leaks, and at least one person found a ""blue ice"" meteor smashed thru their roof. The ""blue ice"" is the frozen disinfectant fluid used on airplanes.

What someone chooses to call the system really doesn't much matter. If you want to call it AD, please continue to do so. If a non-Christian is offended by that and wants to call it CE, let them have their way, too.

It's the same thing by a different name. So if we continue using the same thing why give it a differnt name? That's just confusing. It's like the recent change in the Dutch language that exchanges one illogical set of rules for another one. But this is worse, because it's the same rule (which is as (il)logical as any other would be). And the  Common Era  article starts by pointing out that it can also be read as  Christian Era . So we're back where we started. Before I encountered this here (I've never seen it used aywhere else) I never thought about what 'AD' stood for (although I was aware of it). Now I'm irritated everytime I see a date (well, that's an exaggeration).       A rule I often follow is that if you want to change something, the more traditional it is, the stronger your arguments have to be. Well, tradition is long and strong here and I don't see a single argument for the change. All that is achieved is that people get confused. I still do, even though I know about it (which most people won't). A change that  would  make sense would be to introduce a year zero, in accordance with all other measurements. Or make time measurement decimal (10 hours per day, 100 minutes per hour, that sort of thing). But that's a different story.  DirkvdM  09:26, 8 January 2006 (UTC)               I do like the idea of going to  decimal time , which has been tried occasionally, such as after the French Revolution, but never really caught on. I would also like to stop the silly use of time zones and daylight savings time and have everyone go to  Universal Coordinated Time . It really is the same time everywhere, as measured from the Big Bang or creation of the universe by your favorite diety, but we pretend it is different times to make the Sun rise at approximately the same time all over the world (plus or minus about 3 hours, which hardly seems worth the effortÂ !).

Is this product safe for children or people who should not drink alcohol? Could this product produce intoxication, or cause a person to smell as if they have been drinking (alcohol/liquor)? Thank You, DB     Alcohol by volume  is a measure of what proportion of the total volume of the beverage is composed of alcohol. (It is also the  proof  divided by two.) So 45% ABV means that just shy of half the liquid in Angostura bitters is alcohol.       As to whether it's safe, that depends on your standards. Bitters are typically used in very small quantities - one or two drops at a time - so the amount of alcohol you'll get from an average serving is tiny, far too little to get even a child drunk. However, some people who abstain as part of their treatment for  alcoholism  will not even drink that little bit. -- George  00:54, 8 January 2006 (UTC)           Note that many cold remedies for children also contain alcohol. The same logic applies, they just don't drink enough to get intoxicated.  StuRat  01:55, 8 January 2006 (UTC)           For clarification: one could also measure the alcohol content by weight. Since alcohol is much lighter than water (the main other constituent of just about any drink), that percentage would be lower. Why volume is used in stead of weight, I don't know, but I suppose it was just a matter of flipping a coin, so to say.  DirkvdM  09:39, 8 January 2006 (UTC)       I suppose it makes things easier when determining how much alcohol someone is allowed to have in their system. Blood alcohol levels are also easily determined in percentages. -  Mgm | (talk)  12:08, 8 January 2006 (UTC)       (After edit conflict) Well, manufacturers could manipulate alcohol by weight measures by using more or less dense mixers. The good thing about alcohol by volume is that given a vessel or serving of known volume, it doesn't take any further tools to work out the amount of alcohol in that vessel. (In the UK, the size of spirit serving must by law be displayed). The responsible drinker than therefore plan their intake. The irresponsible drinker too, if they can still do arithmetic. To the original poster: 45% by volume is about as much alchohol as whisky has in it, but it would be harder to drink bitters to excess (for most people).

The Viscountcy of Clare, created for Robert Craggs-Nugent on 19 January 1767 in the Peerage of Ireland, became extinct on his death, because he had no male heirs. The Barony of Nugent of Carlanstown also became extinct on his death, for the same reason (it was recreated for the 1st Earl's daughter, the wife of the 2nd Earl, with a special remainder to her son George, but that also became extinct when George died without children). The title of Earl Nugent didn't become extinct on the 1st Earl's death, because it was created with a special remainder, failing heirs male of his body, to his son-in-law, George Grenville, who became the 2nd Earl. The Earldom became extinct on the death of the second earl's great-grandson, the last heir male of his body, in 1889. -  Nunh-huh  04:16, 8 January 2006 (UTC)       [ edit ]   asociation of relexologist in the uk e-mail address     Try  Association of Reflexologists .

I was hoping that someone could provide me with information as to where I can find guides and such for building a machine, where to buy parts from, what sort of parts I should get, and how to store those components (if a special storage method is necessary.)   I currently use a Dell XPS with a 3.60 GHz processor, and 1022 RAM, but I don't necessarily need all that for my first machine, it really depends on how much it will cost and how difficult it will be to make.   Thanks in advance,  Demonesque  11:20, 8 January 2006 (UTC)     This isn't an answer, but just an observation: if you want to do this to save money, you will be disappointed. It will almost certainly cost more to buy the parts than to buy an assembled computer. (That's not a reason not to do it, it's interesting and educational, but you need a realistic view.) In addition, if you want to run Windows, it costs *much* more to buy a copy of Microsoft Windows at retail than it does for your PC manufacturer (who buys OEM copies in bulk at a huge discount); transferring Windows from another machine is not generally a legal solution because it will probably be OEM (and untransferable, even if sending the machine to landfill). This doesn't apply if you want to run Linux.  Notinasnaid  11:41, 8 January 2006 (UTC)       Shuttle Computers aren't bad for starting off, they're small-factor computers and you buy the case with the motherboard already in.

See  http://www.shuttle.com   87.80.210.29  15:16, 8 January 2006 (UTC)         Building a computer is a bit like a puzzle; if you're a logical thinker, and you're good at them, it shouldn't be too hard to assemble them, provided you follow the instructions.   It'll cost more to build your own, but there will be more of a ""wow, I did it"" feeling once you're finished. (Which also means you'll cry when it dies.)   Store components in an anti-static bag. They're not necessarily rare, but they can be pricey from what I understand. I used to get mine from work; we had a general excess of them.     As long as you keep the amount of stuff you buy to a minimum (buy your video card and memory last; it'll be cheaper when you're done), take your time, buy an anti-static wrist strap, and follow all directions, you should be fine. Oh, and don't use Windows. Use Linux.  Cernen  06:50, 9 January 2006 (UTC)         In my experience, physically putting together a computer is easier than installing all the software. With msWindows that is, because you have to install everything yourself. Linux distros often come with a humungous amount of software that you can install along with the OS, which even installs more easily than msWindows these days. The only problem is when you want to install other software, because getting the dependencies fulfilled (or how do you say that) can be hell. But  Debian  seem to have cracked that.   But back to the hardware. Last time I put a computer together I didn't have a proper manual for what goes where and the architecture was new to me, but everything went well because you simply can't stick something in the wrong place - it just won't fit. The only exception was with some minor connectors (builtin beepspeaker and such), but the coding gave that away (with some educated guessing).

Despite this, I'd like to make a small searchable database (I believe this is the correct term) for personal use. I would have a page for each item -- in this case, each item is an episode of a TV series I own. For example, I'd have a list of TV shows - I'd click Frasier, then Season 1, and it would show all 24 episodes, then I'd click one and it would bring up a page about it, with guest stars, trivia, what disc it's on in my DVD cabinet, what special features it has, and more importantly, keywords I've entered for it. I'd be able to search the database for a keyword to find things.   What would I need in order to actually make this? It is basically just using a search-box to find keywords I've attached to a .HTML page. It would only need to search in the ""keywords"" section, if it makes it easier. Thank you. ----Alice Barron, January 9 2006     The problem is that search box has to correspond with not only searching code but a database chock full of information. There is no terribly simple way to create a custom database, unfortunately. An easier solution than trying to create on with a web interface (because even simple ones require a lot of learning in terms of PHP and MySQL) is to try a dedicated database creation program. Most of these cost money   FileMaker  and  Microsoft Access  are two of the most popular ones. The only one I know of that doesn't cost money is  OpenOffice.org Base , though my brief playing with it had not made feel that it is very easy to use (its interface is modeled on Access, which is not the most intuitive program). It would be  very  easy for someone with some minimal database-creation experience to make what you would want, but it would be a lot of investment for someone without any experience to make such a thing if they didn't plan on doing anything else with the knowledge. My suggestion is to poke around online for someone who would be willing to create such a thing for you, or else commit to learning how to use one of the above solutions. -- Fastfission  17:11, 8 January 2006 (UTC)       I've been using  Advanced File Organizer  for years, and find it suits my needs. It does all that you've listed above.  Natgoo  18:25, 8 January 2006 (UTC)       I don't know what else to say but this: why hasn't anyone suggested she get herself a  wiki ? It doesn't take much effort to set up if you follow the instructions they provide at Meta. I have my own wiki and love it to death, use it for all sorts of things. They come with built-in search, and if you've ever used Wikipedia, then you'd already have an idea of how to get it running. That's my suggestion.  Cernen   Xanthine   Katrena  08:29, 15 January 2006 (UTC)       [ edit ]   Quotation marks   When should I use single quotation marks over double? eg. 'Death of a salesman' OR ""Death of a salesman""?     There is no universal agreement. Most people in North America use double quotes as the primary type and reserve single quotes for quotations within quotations. This is sometimes done in Britain, but the opposite style is more commonly seen there. (There are also a few people who vary between single and double quotes depending on exactly what they are using the quotation marks for, but that's definitely nonstandard.) The  quotation marks  article mentions this, but probably should go into it in a bit more depth.       The specific example was a title. For titles, it is often recommended that quotation marks should be reserved for shorter works such as short stories; titles of books, plays, and movies go in italics (or they are underlined if italics are not available). So rather than either 'Death of a Salesman' or ""Death of a Salesman"", the preferred choice is  Death of a Salesman .       --Anonymous, 17:40 UTC, January 8, 2006       If you are referring to how to use quotes specifically for Wikipedia articles, it's given in the  manual of style . -  Akamad  19:15, 8 January 2006 (UTC)           Funny, I was just told off by gidonb on the  Netherlands talk page  (last posting) for using single quotes in phrases like ""The English plural 'Netherlands' is a remnant from ..."". Note the double quotes around the whole phrase (because it is a quote) and the single quotes around 'Netherlands' to mark it as a word that is not part of the sentence but the subject of it. Gidonb changed that to double quotes. I've always believed that my method was standard (and I've been altering it all over Wikipedia), but now I've started to doubt. The manual of style does not address this, only the use of quotation marks for quotes.

I am especially talking about music made outside the US, and possibly having (or not having) copyrights in other countries.  deeptrivia  ( talk ) 22:53, 8 January 2006 (UTC)     You should generally be very wary of anything you download using P2P. Some independent bands (and occasionally major ones) will release their music via the Internet and permit free distribution. Some of these are even ""sponsored bands"" who work directly with some of the peer-to-peer programs to get their music out. A simple, general rule is that if you could buy the music somewhere, it's probably illegal to download it - but this of course does not constitute legal advice. ( ESkog ) ( Talk )  23:54, 8 January 2006 (UTC)    Note: that last rule is note necessarily true.

Russia is a country in Asia. But we dont call them Asians like the other countries (China, Japan, Korea etc...)thier is a certain word that people use to call Russian's, Siberian's, etc... I saw when I was about to take a test, and you have to bubble in what nationality you are, so I saw it said Russia and other countries listed. Then thier was a bracket to combine all those countries, and a word next to it that tells you what nationality they really are or what you would call them.

The word (and article) you are looking for might be  Slavic . -- Canley  23:55, 8 January 2006 (UTC)       It's worth pointing out here that Russia is a country of very many ethnicities, so you have to distinguish between Russian  nationality  (as in someone born in Russia) and Russian  ethnicity . Ethnic Russians are Slavs, not Asians. But native peoples of east-Siberia such as  Buryats  are Asians, not Slavs. But they still have a Russian nationality. See the article  Demographics of Russia , which has a quite impressive list of ethnical groups. -- BluePlatypus  00:18, 9 January 2006 (UTC)       A big chunk of Russia is in Europe. -- Nelson Ricardo  00:44, 9 January 2006 (UTC)           Not the biggest chunk in size (it's the part west of the  Ural ), but certainly the most populous part. And that's where the Russian  Slavs  live. Actually, all Slavs are Europeans. And most Russians.  DirkvdM  10:36, 9 January 2006 (UTC)         The ruling class has always been of European ancestry and culture, starting with  Vikings , I believe. This is why it's considered a European country even though most of it is in Asia. In a reverse example,  Turkey  could perhaps be considered an Asian country, even though part of it is in Europe, since it's people are primarily of Asian descent.

If you had such an original and a possible copy, the presence of the same single bit errors would indicate a copy, or possibly that both were copied from a common source. If your copy is perfect, however, I don't see how you could tell. And if, as I suspect, you have no access to the potential copy, then there is no way to know.  StuRat  10:37, 9 January 2006 (UTC)     Untrue, because the strong  Error Correcting Code  used by DVDs fixes all single-bit errors. -- cesarb  14:27, 9 January 2006 (UTC)           To see if anyone else had opened it you could dust the DVD or its case for fingerprints. Or with a little advance planning you could seal the case with a small piece of tape so that you could see if it has been opened. Or place a tiny scrap of paper in the case which will fall out if the case is opened in your absence. -- Shantavira  16:58, 9 January 2006 (UTC)                   You could just accuse your friend of copying your DVD and see how he reacts.

What's the reason?  deeptrivia  ( talk ) 05:46, 9 January 2006 (UTC)     Due to  Arab-Israeli conflict , holders of  Israeli  passports are not allowed entry into  Saudi Arabia . Moreover, Saudi Arabian immigration authorities may not issue visas to people they suspect to be linked with Israel. As a peripheral piece of information, many Saudi banks (through Letter of Credit terms) insist ocean vessels to issue certificates that they are not of Israeli origin nor have they called on Israeli ports on that voyage. -- Tachs  07:17, 9 January 2006 (UTC)       Right, so it's not about Jews (which would have been odd since they're all  Semites ) but about Israel. This sort of thing is not uncommon. Eg, you can't enter the US with a Cuban stamp in your passport (which is why your passport doesn't get stamped when entering Cuba). There are more examples, but I can't think of any now.  DirkvdM  10:48, 9 January 2006 (UTC)           Does the Cuban example apply to everyone, or only to Americans?

Loganberry  ( Talk ) 12:23, 9 January 2006 (UTC)                   I know dozens of Canadians who have been to Cuba, and not one has ever been prevented from entering the US.

I don't know how strictly this rule is enforced; it's not always easy to tell if someone is Jewish.  CharlesÂ P. Â  (Mirv)  15:02, 9 January 2006 (UTC)     Thanks! Would they ask your religion before they let you enter? I know that several Islamic countries do not allow Israelis. Do some of them also similarly ban all Jews?  deeptrivia  ( talk ) 15:11, 9 January 2006 (UTC)     I doubt anyone bans Jews in practice. How exactly would they determine your faith? (Impossible) Or would they go by who has a jewish-sounding surname? (error-prone) Or do a genealogy of every visitor? (Too labor-intensive)  This page  (for Syria) says they'll stop you if you have an Israeli passport, visa or stamp. For fairness sake, it's worth mentioning it's not easy to get into Israel with a Syrian or Egyptian passport either. -- BluePlatypus  22:10, 9 January 2006 (UTC)       According to  this , the ban on Jews was put on their home-page last year, together with bans on ""those who don't abide by the Saudi traditions concerning appearance and behaviours"" and ""those under the influence of alcohol"". After protests, this page has been removed. None of these bans appear to be particularily practical to enforce at the border, and I have no idea if they're being enforced in practice right now. But there's no doubt they'll throw you out of the country if you're drunk in public, wearing a bikini or preaching Christianity or Judaism. But that's not really news either. -- BluePlatypus  22:24, 9 January 2006 (UTC)       I personally know a Jew who was banned from engineering work in Saudi Arabia (this was in the 1960s or 70s) simply on the basis of ethnicity. It is possible that this was not offical law but a ""sensitive"" company policy; I don't know enough to say for sure.  Thomas Friedman  has of course visited Saudia Arabia many times in recent years (then again, he is a very public figure).-- Pharos  00:46, 10 January 2006 (UTC)           Loganberry, about not being alowed to visit Cuba, you're right, that only applies to US citizens. Still, the immigration might give you a hard time just to piss you off (any excuse will do for those bastards). But the visa is a loose leaflet, so just take it out of the passport. By the way, it's not stricly true that US'ers aren't allowed to visit Cuba. They're just not allowed to spend any money there. Right! Â :)   And about the Jew-thing. Sounds unlikely it applies in either case, but the word can mean two completely different things; religion and ancestry/ethnicity (what is the right word here?). And both would be extremely hard to check (if not impossible, unless the person says it). And anyway, as I already suggested, why would the Arabs mind? It's  Israel  they have problems with.  DirkvdM  10:32, 10 January 2006 (UTC)    Why would anyone ""mind"" if someone of the ""wrong"" ethnicity comes into their country?

DirkvdM  11:38, 9 January 2006 (UTC)       Since everyone wanted to get everywhere, horses and carriages weren't useful any more. Necessity is the mother of invention.  Kid Apathy  15:37, 9 January 2006 (UTC)           Well there were also trains, but those needed a separate infrastructure, which wasn't quite as extensive yet as roads were. By the way, I don't think  everyone  wanted to get everywhere (talking about the 18th century now). The vast majority of people could't afford a car (couldn't afford a fordÂ :) ) (or even a decent meal for many). Only about half a century ago were cars cheap enough and wages high enough for many people to be able to buy a car. So it might as well be that the invention createed the sense of necessity (the rich have it, we wants it too, our prrrrecious). And for another by the way, even now not quite everyone has a car (in the Netherlands it's one car per 3 people and that's a wealthy country). And cars as they are now can never be for everyone. Just think of toddlers and demented people. And many people who  are  allowed to drive cars shouldn't. The result is a death toll of 25 million ( 25 million !).   So why cars indeed?

Pel  was known for his beautiful goals, which is a dead give-away. And  forward  indeed means attacker. By the way, the game is called 'football'. Or  association football  if you wish.

Or 'merrer', like I said. If you insist on 'soccer' you have to be a good sport and accept that name too. Would you? And if you wouldn't, then can you accept why we won't accept 'soccer'?  DirkvdM  10:51, 10 January 2006 (UTC)                           Don't complain, DirkvdM. The English invented the word ""soccer."" It's a very British word. If Americans were to come up with a short form of ""Association football,"" they would call it ""soc-ball"" (pronounced ""soash-ball"") or something.                               It's interesting, actually. I looked through the headlines in the  New York Times archives  and found the semantic discrepancy between (American) ""football"" and ""soccer"" did not really come up until the early 1900s, when colleges were looking for a substitute for the American game (American-football players of the period had the nasty habit of getting killed during games). Between the introduction of organized ""football"" (closer to rugby) in the US in the 1870s and the 1900s, there was only one popular autumn game: ""football,"" which gradually became a specifically American game over those decades. By the time of the great controversy (around 1905), advocates of ""English rugby,"" ""Association football"" and even Canadian football pleaded their case for their games to replace American football as the big autumn sport. Of those sports, soccer made the greatest progress, but lost most of its inroads after reforms made American football safer. The point is, by the time organized FA-rules ""soccer"" hit American shores, the word ""football"" in the US had already been reserved for a game that had branched off from rugby.                               Oh, and see  football (word)  --  Mwalcoff  01:18, 11 January 2006 (UTC)                                   Yeah, I know the English invented the abbreviation soccer, but that was kids. Adults hardly ever use it, do they? The BBC don't and their word is gospel to me.Â :)   I always thought that merrer players were a bunch of sissie with their helmets and shoulder padding, but if people got killed playing it, that explains a lot. Does any of this happen in  Aussie rules ? Seems a lot tougher, and they don't use any protection. Or rugby, for that matter (for which the knocked out teeth are an indication).

But it also depends on some factors, such as age (eg yes if you're 15 like me, not necessarily if you're 8).  Yeltensic42.618   don't   panic  17:49, 9 January 2006 (UTC)       Depends on your quality of hair (thin/thick, oily/dry, etc), the quality of the skin of your scalp, and so on. You can damage your hair by washing it too much. If you work out a lot and usually shower or bathe twice a day, you might not want to shampoo your hair both times. Although some people have no problems with this. If you have long hair, you might want to wash it less often than once a day. But if you have an oily scalp, you might want to wash more often. -- BluePlatypus  22:34, 9 January 2006 (UTC)           As indirectly indicated above, a distinction should be made between washing with water and with water and soap (ie shampoo). I wash my hair daily, but I haven't used shampoo for 15 years now (except occasionally when I'm really dirty for some reason) and that stopped my hair from falling out (else I would have gotten as bald as my brother). A midway solution might be to use baby shampoo.  DirkvdM  10:59, 10 January 2006 (UTC)           [ edit ]   Victorian era   Who were the leaders in the Victorian Era? What were the politics like?

An object, even a living one, can't just increase or decrease in mass spontaneously. It could change density, and therefore volume, however.       Speed of change. There are organisms that undergo amazing changes now, like a caterpillar into a butterfly. However, such changes don't occur instantly, but take quite a long time for a transition period.

If you conceptually trust the concept of  Star Trek  beaming yourself into a computer system of some kind, e-mailing yourself to a different computer system, then rematerializing at the destination, the computer systems could perhaps analyse you so as to reconstitute you in a smaller mass, that retains the memories, and adds some motor functions to help you cope.

User:AlMac | (talk)  23:22, 10 January 2006 (UTC)           ""Is it possible?"" is a vague sort of question. There is no technology today that gives any prospect of doing this sort of thing or being extended in the foreseeable future to do it. However, there is no physical law that keeps the matter of a living thing's body from being rearranged, as StuRat's example of the caterpillar shows. Imagine a primitive man looking at a bird and remembering how he once made a weapon out of a sharpened stick, and asking ""Is it possible that someone will make a thing that will let fly through the air and carry people at 20 times that speed?"" Is the answer yes or no? Depends on what you mean by ""possible"", right?

After reading the Wikipedia article and linked pages I'm still puzzled. The region below the eyes will reflect light, but unless the athlete is wearing goggles or glasses, I don't see how it reduces glare, since there is no surface for the reflected light to strike.     Black does not reflect. It absorbs all light. -- Nelson Ricardo  00:30, 10 January 2006 (UTC)    In the  Light pollution  article there is a description of  glare . In this case, glare is caused by the sun hitting the skin on your face and bouncing into your eyes. Eye black absorbs that light. You may be thinking of glare on your car window, for example.

If you're sitting opposite someone in a train that distance should be safe. But I now realise that someone who sneezes flexes forward (is that good English?). And this may very well be the reason for that (from the flu's point of view, that is).                       By the way, the event horizon of a sneeze would be where nothing escapes it anymore.

It's a good idea to avoid this ""sneeze zone"" for a few minutes until everything settles down.

Uhm... if I knew the number of blocks in NY, then I could figure it out. But I can't find that out anywhere. It's pretty difficult to define a ""block"", if NYC is anything like London. There are 26537.216828478964401294498381877 people per square mile in NYC, though. I think. (This is my attempt at a useful answer.)  Kid Apathy  16:52, 10 January 2006 (UTC)           I Googled ""new york city block length"" and found:  20 uptown/downtown blocks and 10 crosstown blocks equal approximately one mile . That puts the average downtown Manhattan block at about 530 ft by 260 ft. Also, Kid, please respect  WP:POINT . Population density to 30 significant figures is patently useless.

StuRat  06:16, 11 January 2006 (UTC)     (I was writing this simultaneously and had an edit conflict. I'll post it anyway; apologies for the partial duplication.)   According to  New York City , the city's population is 8.2 million and the area is 309 square miles (which is not in single digits). But these aren't exact numbers; the population is probably being rounded to the nearest 0.1 million and the area to the nearest square mile. There is no point in giving the population density to any greater accuracy: all you can say is that it's about 26,500, and the ""5"" is questionable. (There are more precise ways to express the uncertainty, of course.)   And then it's even worse than that. I was suspicious about that 309 square miles because it converts to exactly 800 km; I wondered if someone had started with a metric figure to the nearest 100 km and converted it with spurious accuracy. So I did some web searching and found that Wikipedia's  New York metropolitan area  article, as well as the  Encarta  and  Information Please  web sites, agree on an area of 303 square miles for the city. (Encarta gives areas of individual boroughs to one decimal place in some cases, too, and the five areas as given total 303.3 square miles.) But the city's  official web site  gives the area as 321 square miles, and some other sites show that number too. So we can say at least that the 309 is not necessarily accurate to the nearest square mile.   When people say ""New York City"", sometimes they mean the Borough of  Manhattan  alone. The original poster's reference to blocks suggests that that was the intended meaning. Likewise for the answers by Lomn and Hydnjo. Blocks in the other boroughs are a good deal more varied. Manhattan has an area of only 23 square miles (still not single digits, but getting there) and a population of over 1.5 million; its population density is around 70,000 per square mile.   --Anonymous, 06:30 UTC, January 11, 2006.         cries* I was trying to help.

Perhaps there are insulated shipping containers, but those might be harder to obtain. Some type of spray-on foam insulation might be the easiest way to improve the situation, but certainly won't look very appealing. You could put some sheet rock up to give it a nice homey look inside, I suppose, maybe along with a suspended ceiling and linoleum floor. The outside will tend to rust over time, but it will be many years before the rust perforates to the interior. Still, it could look quite hideous with rust stains on the sides. A nice brick wall around the shipping container would improve the looks immensely and also help the insulation.

While I can't answer your question directly I would suggest that you be upfront with your tax department about what happened. At the same time notify the contractor that you are going to advise the tax people.

Is this your question (please respond in some way).  hydnjo   talk  03:21, 11 January 2006 (UTC)       So, roughly 7 percent as many people are alive now as are dead. For people who believe in ghosts, this would mean the Earth would be clogged with them. And, if they stay where they lived or died, ancient cities with large historic populations, like Rome and Baghdad, would be even more crowded, so crowded you couldn't take a step without walking through one. Only places never much inhabited, like Antarctica, would be sparsely populated with ghosts.  StuRat  04:20, 11 January 2006 (UTC)           Well, since this is obviously the silly season: those who believe in ghosts are quite likely to also believe in reincarnation. It is said a spirit is reincarnated many, many times into different bodies. So there are probably far, far fewer ghosts than c. 93 billion. Possibly only about 1 billion (but that's as scientific a guess as I can manage today, sorry).  JackofOz  07:14, 11 January 2006 (UTC)    All of the reincarnation beliefs that I am familiar with are at odds with the existence of ghosts.

Motor oil isn't terribly toxic either, but again, I wouldn't drink it. Turpentine is toxic and dangerous to ingest, to inhale and in skin contact. So the mixture would be dangerous. An additional warning: Linseed oil oxidizes in air, and rags soaked in it are known to self-ignite and start a fire, especially if they're put in a confined space where the heat of oxidation cannot escape.

Chuck  20:10, 11 January 2006 (UTC)         The Earth roates now because it has since it was formed and ""an object in motion (rotational, in this case) stays in motion unless another force acts upon it"". It formed from a rotating cloud due to the solar system's rotation. The solar system's rotation is due to the Milky Way galaxy's rotation, which is due to an uneven distribution of mass following the Big Bang. Now, what caused that, we don't know.  StuRat  05:48, 11 January 2006 (UTC)     Most planets rotate in the direction in which they evolve around the Sun. You'd think that if the initial rotating disk was faster at the centre that at the rim that would be the other way around. But I recently heard (if I remember correctly) that galaxies rotate faster at the rim. Which is counterintuitive, although I can't really say why. Maybe I'm used to the driving force of a rotating disk being at the centre (as in human engineering) and there being friction at the rim. But that doesn't apply here. Still, I see no reason why it is the way it is.  DirkvdM  08:47, 11 January 2006 (UTC)       Yea. galaxies are weird. They don't seem to behave the way one would expect.

StuRat  05:37, 11 January 2006 (UTC)       Tinnitus may be part of the answer. But even for people with no tinnitus, when in complete external silence (which assumes the person is at complete rest) they can still hear some of their own internal processes such as heart beat, blood flow through the ears, etc. To that degree, there probably is no such thing, for a sentient being with hearing, as ""complete silence"".  JackofOz  05:55, 11 January 2006 (UTC)       Probably not what you meant, but I sometimes hear a very high pitch (at the very top of my hearing range) that suddenly sets in and then dies away in a few seconds.

StuRat  10:20, 11 January 2006 (UTC)           If you only hear it  at home  it could be the cooling fans present inside so many electrical appliances. Or other electrical effects (e.g. some kinds of lighting may make a noise). Boy is it quiet here when there is a power cut.  Notinasnaid  10:03, 11 January 2006 (UTC)     I had an interesting silence related experience once....I was doing the laundry, had both the washer and dryer going, and the A/C and also had the TV and several lights on, then I found a pill bug/rolly-polly/armadillo bug on the wall. I flushed it down the toilet, and right as it disappeared the house went dark and silent. Before I figure out it was the fuse I thought, ""oh damn, that bug must have been God, and now I've gone and destroyed the universe.""  StuRat  10:27, 11 January 2006 (UTC)   Possibly the ""complete silence"" you are hearing is not really silence at all. You may be hearing stuff that you normally tune out. Also silence in your house is louder than silence when you are 100 miles away from any other person out on the tundra. To actually do that is to really ""hear silence"".  CambridgeBayWeather   (Talk)  21:16, 11 January 2006 (UTC)         I would think that there's some wind on the tundra. For the best example of places to go to ""hear"" absolute silence, I'd suggest a cave. Deepest you can find. No wind and any noise from the outside world would be dampened to nothing by the surrounding dirt/rock.  Dismas | (talk)  21:23, 11 January 2006 (UTC)    I did mean on a calm day. It's a very strange experience. I just thought that possibly the house sound may be releated to the sound you hear when you put a seashell to your ear and would not a cave have the same effect? It may well be that the only place you could find a complete absence of noise is in a specially designed room.  CambridgeBayWeather   (Talk)  12:08, 12 January 2006 (UTC)             Some  cathode ray tubes  can emit a high pitched sound, probably a sub-resonance of the  horizontal scan rate  (the actual scan rate is well above our hearing range.)

Some don't care a bit about the ""historic"" value of the car, and just want to tear out all the old junk and get a decent car out of the deal. Others are so extreme about keeping everything ""original"" that they keep unsafe features (like a lack of seat belts) and unsightly features (like oxidized, ugly old paint). Most restorers are somewhere in-between on this continuum.

Construction cost positively correlates strongly with tonnage. Shipping costs would tend to have a weak positive correlation, though there's generally little direct competition between very large and very small cargo ships. Passage costs would have no correlation to tonnage.   Lomn  |  Talk  /  RfC  14:35, 11 January 2006 (UTC)    Could you read through  tonnage  and say if you mean the amount of cargo it can hold or the actual size of a ship. A ship of the type used in the  America's Cup  or an executive vessel as used by the stereotypical Greek shipping magnate is going to be very expensive for it's size.

TERdON               My guess is that there was a fad for women to dye their hair blonde at some point in the  20th Century  (most likely the  1940s  or  1950s ). Combine that with a single hugely popular example of the stereotypical ""ditzy blonde"" (think  Marilyn Monroe  or any of a number of early 1950s tv stars), and the emergence of the jokes became almost inevitable. -- Aaron  22:17, 11 January 2006 (UTC)       [ edit ]   17-pack of chewing gum?   Why does gum come in 17-packs? Most items come in 6- or 10- or 12-packs, and 17 seems like such an arbitrary number. I searched the recent archives for this (obvious) question already, but couldn't find a place where it was asked.  Tigger89  18:43, 11 January 2006 (UTC)     Maybe it makes the pack up to a particular weight, or particular dimension, that is popular with retailers: standard sizes make shelf stacking easier.  Notinasnaid  18:47, 11 January 2006 (UTC)           Or it could be that this was the largest that the particular machinery in use at the factories when this size was introduced could handle. (I have a 17-pack here and I note that the dimension through the 17 sticks is exactly 4 cm. Coincidence? Could be.) Another reason odd sizes happen is that the makers start with a round-number size, then decide to manipulate the market by enlarging or reducing it a bit. They might start with a 20-pack, then decide to raise the price by keeping the price the same and reducing it to 18, then 17 sticks. Or conversely they might start with 15, then say ""now 2 extra sticks"" to produce a temporary price reduction, then later raise the price to match. This sort of thing goes on all the time with all sorts of products, although I'm not aware of any earlier size of 17-packs of gum. --Anonymous, 21:25 UTC, January 11.           This is pure conjecture on my part, but these days most manufacturers engage in a lot of research to determine just what size/amount of a given product at a given price will result in maximum profits for the company. For example (and I'm just making these numbers up for the sake of argument), if you sell a bottle of  Coca-Cola  for 99 cents, it may prove to be more beneficial for Coke to make that bottle contain 20 oz. of liquid instead of 16 oz., because otherwise consumers may think they're not getting their money's worth. A million variables can go into this sort of thing; here in the U.S., Coke is sold in 8 oz. bottles and cans, 12 oz. cans, 16 oz. glass bottles, 16.9 oz. plastic bottles, 20 oz. bottles, 1 liter bottles, 2 liter bottles ... and probably several other sizes I'm not aware of. In each case, Coke spends a huge amount of time researching precisely how to price each size to maximize sales. So what does this have to do with gum? Perhaps the 17-pack was a very early example of such research; it's possible Wrigley Gum experimented with an 18-pack and discovered it didn't increase sales, and that a 16-pack did cause a decrease in sales, thus the 17-pack was decided upon as the most profitable size for the price. -- Aaron  21:51, 11 January 2006 (UTC)       This is also pure speculation on my part, but sometimes these sizes are dictated by the manufacturing or packaging process. For example, perhaps the strips of paper that make the individual wrappers for the sticks of gum divide easily in such a way that you can get seventeen wrappers from one unit of paper, or perhaps the gum itself dictates a convenient seventeen-stick unit, perhaps as a quarter of a pound, or one rotation of the machinery that processes the sticks.

Marak24                   Mmmm...most interesting. iTunes generally doesn't just  not work . If you took music from a friend's computer, stuff that he bought, and try to use it on yours, it won't play at all; I had this problem when I signed up for .mac and had to get two ITMS accounts to work on one computer (a royal pain in the ass, mind you). That's probably why iTunes won't play. As for your ""audio device"" problem, that could mean a number of things. Your sound card could be shot for whatever reason, and depending on how old your computer is, finding a replacement might be difficult unless you try eBay. Windows might not have any drivers for it, and if that's the case, it's as simple as installing the drivers; of course, you'll have to either find out the manufacturer of your sound card, or find the disks that came with your computer. The best solution, however, is probably to reinstall Windows. (Be careful how you go about that, though; if you do it the wrong way, Windows will be generous enough to format your whole hard drive.)

If you've got latex gloves (you know, the kind you use for housecleaning), you might try that with some rubber cement. I'm assuming you've patched holes before, but in case you haven't, get a nail file from somewhere and some rubber cement. Find the hole, rough up the surface with the nail file, cut out a small circle of rubber from an old tube, rough that up, apply rubber cement to both surfaces, then press together.

Movies: ""The Triumph of Sherlock Holmes"" (1934) and ""Murder at the Baskervilles"" (1937)   William Johnston     According to the Internet Movie Database, the  Ian Fleming  in those movies isn't the same one as the  Ian Fleming  of Bond fame.

Like Wikipedia, they rely largely on user-submitted data and therefore can be unreliable, particularly for less-well-known movies. Perhaps someone just picked the wrong Ian Fleming and the manager in charge of cast lists didn't notice. It seems particularly likely in view of the fact that Fleming the author died in 1964. --Anonymous, 07:10 UTC, January 12.

Imagine working at a place where the employees are supposed to know important stuff by  telepathy  because no one ever tells them though any official channels. Further suppose that none of the employees can actually do telepathy, because the hiring department neglected to test for that skill, because the people who run the hiring department lack the telepathy to know that is a requirement of people being hired there. You'd be surprised how many work places the above is true for. Now imagine what could possibly go wrong as a result of this break down in communications and hiring practices.       Customers could get poisoned for example.   The store can run out of essential ingredients.   There can be mistakes made with the money.

Lomn   Talk  16:12, 12 January 2006 (UTC)    I would think it would also depend on the quality of the shirt.

Well  King Cobra  says that the venom is weaker than other snakes. But it injects a large amount .2 fluid ounces (7 ml) and that can kill 20-30 people.

Also as long as it does not inject more than 2 ml a person then yes it could kill 3 in a row.

The  Judicial branch  is meant to interpret the law; if the Chief Justice were to be suddenly thrust into the presidency, he'd suddenly be part of  making  it. There's also the matter of experience; even the lowest-ranking people on the  Presidential line of succession  list have extensive experience working at the highest levels of the  Executive branch ; the Chief Justice usually has none at all, and if he does, it tends to have been many years in the past. -- Aaron  03:21, 13 January 2006 (UTC)    In fact, there's some degree of concern with having members of the Legislative branch in the line of succession. Suppose that the government is obliterated to the point that the Secretary of the Interior becomes acting President. At that point, Congressional remnants could elect a new Speaker of the House, conceivably of a different party, who would then have precedence and supplant the acting President.   Lomn   Talk  05:20, 13 January 2006 (UTC)    No, if the Secretary of the Interior were inaugurated, he or she would remain President even if some of the positions that  would  have had precedence are later filled.

Keenan Pepper  13:17, 13 January 2006 (UTC)       If you count the  mandible  as part of the skull, it is possible to dislocate it.  Mirv  13:55, 13 January 2006 (UTC)     Of course it is possible. Any bone connected to another bone by ligaments or muscles can be ""dislocated"" in the sense of the spatial relationship between the two bones being shifted to a physical force producing an abnormal configuration with stretching or tearing of the ligaments or muscles. The skull is articulated with the topmost vertebral body (C1). Dislocation of the skull with respect to C1 can occur with  hanging  or other traumatic injuries. If the spinal cord is injured as the bones shift, death can occur.  alteripse  16:48, 13 January 2006 (UTC)     [ edit ]   what happened the day i was born, september 27th 1990?

As well as public libraries, there are online resources such as the  Toronto Star 's  Pages of the Past , too, but as far as I know they all cost money.               You might also want to try selecting the same two dates in  Google Groups  (using the ""Return messages posted between"" field in their  advanced groups search form ) to see what people were talking about in different  Usenet   newsgroups  then. However, with many thousands of messages available in different newsgroups, you might have to search a while to find any related to anything of interest to you. Despite the word ""newsgroups"", most discussion on Usenet is not about current events, and it never has been.               Side comment: as someone old enough to have first encountered Usenet after I was a university graduate, I find it slightly mind-boggling to be suggesting to someone that they search for their own date of birth!

GeeJo   09:15, 13 January 2006 (UTC)   To add to that: since the blank pages result from printing processes that typically make page counts a multiple of some number like 16, 24 or 32, there would be many more blank pages if it were not for a number of techniques. Techniques for avoiding blank pages at the end include       varying the printing process so that a multiple of a different number has less waste   cutting out blank pages   using layout (e.g. extra publisher's pages at the front, bigger or smaller fonts)   adding adverts or other material   printing ""NOTES"" on the top of the pages so it looks like you are being generous   above all, ruthless editing: popular fiction especially tends to be produced to fit a particular page count, and editors just cut stuff (or even write padding) until it fits, frequently with no involvement from the author.

I don't think it is ever implied anywhere that all of the animals on Skull Island are meant to be at giant size. As far as I know, the dinosaurs are at their correct sizes. -- Maxamegalon2000  21:09, 13 January 2006 (UTC)       Our article explains this. See  King_Kong_(2005_film)#Bestiary .  Night Gyr  08:23, 14 January 2006 (UTC)       Well, dinosaurs  are  giant size, aren't they? There is a limit to the size of animals. Firstly, there is the problem of supporting ones own weight. Dinosaurs pretty much reached the limit of that, I believe (for land animals, that is). Mammals can also be quite big, and have been in the past, just not as big as King Kong, afaik. There is, however, a problem with the insects at the bottom of the crevice. At least some of them looked like insects, like those  weta -like animals (it being a New Zealand film I imagine it was modeled after this insect). Insects use  trachea  for breathing, and from the article: "" Insects do not carry oxygen in their blood, as do vertebrates; this may limit their size."" The trachea need air circulation and as insects get bigger, their volume increases with a power 3 where the surface of the trachea increases with a power 2. Flying insects can probably get biggest because of their fast movement and wing flapping, causing more air current, but I'm guessing now.  DirkvdM  08:43, 14 January 2006 (UTC)           Maybe the island is an an area where the oxygen is more powerful, and deposits of  cavorite  mean that larger animals can evolve.

If I may hazard a guess, one of the requirements to store fuel underground would have been the supply of mains power, so if the location you're concerned about was remote, in the early 20th century there probably wasn't a suitable power source to pump the tanks.       Aside from my standard response of ""go ask at a research library"", perhaps the people in the best position to help you might be the oil companies themselves; many of them have direct corporate lineage to  Standard Oil  and might have internal company documents on the topic. One useful piece of evidence might be pictures of old gas stations. One other source of potentially useful information might be safety standards documents; if you find standards for underground fuel storage tanks, presumably they must have been in use by that date (or soon afterward).       Hopefully somebody can give you a more direct answer. -- Robert Merkel  14:02, 13 January 2006 (UTC)   ""Mains power"" just means electric service. I don't know when but they certainly are a lot of them. From the EPA website: ""EPA estimates that over 95 percent of the nation's two million underground storage tanks hold petroleum products. Of all tanks in use, an estimated 80 percent are unprotected bare-steel tanks, which are most likely to corrode and leak;...""  Rmhermen  14:24, 13 January 2006 (UTC)     This is a  good  question. I went into my research mode and looked things up. A great reference is here  [30]  It seems that above-ground tanks were common until the 60's, but they kept blowing up and killing people. To stop this, they put the tanks underground. A bare steel tank can only last about 20-30 years, so the original tanks are all gone now, with major pollution problems. New underground tanks have onerous conditions, so there may be a swing back to above-ground tanks. -- Zeizmic  15:05, 13 January 2006 (UTC)     Your reference seems a bit biased though and I doubt above-ground tanks will return. It's easier to make an underground tank leak-proof than keep an above-ground tank safe from fire and accidents. The main problem in the USA has been lax regulation on the environmental requirements for underground tanks. Europe has had far less problems in this respect. Still, leaks are less of a problem today, since 1) Tanks installed today are either fiberglass-reinforced-plastic or steel with FRP as corrosion protection. 2) Tighter regulations on underground tanks. Today, leaks can be cleaned up more efficiently too (although that's no excuse!), since there are now mobile plants to treat contaminated soil. Groundwater contamination  is  a major problem in the US due to the sins of the past though, also due to the increased use of the water-soluble gasoline additive  MTBE . -- BluePlatypus  16:55, 13 January 2006 (UTC)     Yes, that reference was from an above-ground tank maker, but it had the history (which was the question), and it's the only one I found (with history). They are using new above-ground tanks at the cottage marina. It's just a matter of economics, and I think that soon underground tanks will have to be double-walled, with leak detection (ie. very expensive) -- Zeizmic  18:01, 13 January 2006 (UTC)     [ edit ]   Crypto machine maker:  Ottico Meccanica Italiana   I've been trying to find out more about the  Ottico Meccanica Italiana  company, which I believe was operating in Rome in the sixties, and produced the  OMI cryptograph .

DirkvdM  09:07, 14 January 2006 (UTC)       [ edit ]   Shaving     Shaving lather is used to soften the hairs. Which has to soak for a few minutes. But if you do the same with just water, that works too; I shave after showering and just wetting my face (water only) has the same effect. So what is the use of the lather? And what are those irritating sticky strips on 'modern' razors for? They feel yuck and getting modern razors without them is by now almost impossible.   It is advised to shave with the grain. I, however, find it more effective to go against the grain (still talking about shavingÂ :) ).   What is the use of after shave? The practical use I thought it had (never used the stuff myself) is to close and disinfect any cuts. But to do that with alcohol...? But now read in the  shaving  article that it doesn't by itself close cuts, so just a piece of toilet paper will do (that's what I use - if ever). My guess is perfume manufacturers realised they didn't sell to half of mankind and then came up with the idea to change the presentation a bit and associate it with something masculine like shaving. And hey presto, their sales doubled. Of course, perfume for men is much older, but that was to do away with the stench. Since 'we westerners' don't 'stink' anymore, what is the point?   And now for the most important one. Why were those 'modern razors' such a success? Half a year ago I was out of blades and decided to try my father's old razor (what are those things called - I mean with a loose blade). The first time I made a bloody mess, but buy the third time I had figured it out; use less presure. Now I always use it because it shaves faster and smoother. Especially when I haven't shaven for a few days. Shaving that with a modern blade (double as it may be) is a lot of work. With an oldfashioned loose-blade razor there is no difference. Even a two week beard comes all off straight away. with the first stroke.   Have electric razors improved in the last decades? I have an old Philips razor from around 1980 and found it wasn't nearly as good as wet shaving (even with a 'modern' razors). Then I heard they had improved and I bought a Braun but found it was no better than my father's old Braun. Then I heard that Philips electric razors are better than Brauns, but I'm not going to put money in something I won't use again.  DirkvdM  09:51, 14 January 2006 (UTC)     I think the progression from the straight razor (the big knife) to the safety razor with disposable razor blades to the disposable safety razor to the electric razor is a steady move from more dangerous and more effective razors to safer and less effective razors. While a straight razor (the old fashioned one) can do an excellent job, you could also possibly kill yourself if you don't know what you're doing. A safety razor can't kill you, but you could still manage to cut yourself. With an electric razor, it's almost impossible to cut yourself or to get a smooth shave. Note that travelling with a straight razor may be troublesome, as it could be considered a weapon. Razor blades could also be considered a weapon. Those ""lubrication strips"" on some disposable safety razors are supposed to soften up the hair. I prefer Bic disposable razors, which don't have those strips.   One recent annoyance is the ""more is better"" trend in safety razors. Two blades was questionable, as the claim that ""the first blade lifts and the second cuts close"" seems suspect, but now they are up to four blades, which is absurd. You are just going to get 4 times the cuts and abrasions from 4 blades, not 4 times a closer cut. I wonder if we will be up to 10 blades on a safety razor (that looks more like a cheese grater) in a few generations. LOL.  StuRat  10:26, 14 January 2006 (UTC)     Hint. Just let it grow. You get a great beard and don't have to spend any money on razors, lotions, lathers, blood coagulants (styptic pencils), bandages, etc. Plus then people will make all kinds of  amusing  religious/ethnic assumptions about you.  Rmhermen  14:50, 14 January 2006 (UTC)    I second that. As a college student, I can use the money. Plus, going to school in rural Ohio, people think I'm Amish.  WAvegetarian   (talk)   (email)   (contribs)  17:33, 14 January 2006 (UTC)    I agree too. Don't shave. It also has the advantage that you don't look so bad if you for some reason don't shave one day. Also, if you want to cut off a two week's beard, try a scissors to cut most of your beard and then any razor should take the rest down very fast.   b_jonas  23:30, 17 January 2006 (UTC)               [ edit ]   arctic foxes   How do zoos keep arctic foxes white the whole year? --KeeganB--     White out.

I have a cat which likes to be outdoors when the temperature is warmer than -20C. I assumed that she was basing her outdoor life on the amount of sunlight due to the fact that in the Arctic it's more noticeable than in southern areas. However, a couple of months ago the temperature rose from -30C to -10C and the cat went crazy trying to get out and spent up to 30 minutes outside at a time. So it was, for this one cat, something other than the sunlight that affected her. Thus for foxes and hares it may be the lack of snow cover that causes the change from white to gray/brown. In which case all the zoo would have to do is provide a white background/enclosure for the animals.

You could also ask your question at  Google Answers , although that costs money.  WAvegetarian   (talk)   (email)   (contribs)  15:58, 14 January 2006 (UTC)           Hmm, that Wikipedia search results in a lot of user pages without the word 'philosopher' in them. I wonder why that is, but then what does an amateur philosopher know. Speaking of which, I don't appear in that list because on my page I use the word 'philosophy' (for the study I've done). Alas, using that term doesn't help in finding me either on the first pageÂ :( . Luckily, there is not a whole bunch of people who use phrases like ""my philosophy is..."" in a sense that has nothing to do with philosophy. If you Google that term you're even bothered with loads of companies that think they 'have a philosophy' when they've come up with a marketing scheme.   As for 'expert in philosophy'. That can roughly mean two things; people who have read loads of thick books by long dead people with long beards or people who like to take a step back and think reality over for themselves. The latter are the philosophers themselves.  DirkvdM  07:55, 15 January 2006 (UTC)                   Not to be a spoilsport, but having read loads of thick books by long dead people means that you don't waste time having brilliant insights that, say,  Plato  refuted a couple of thousand years ago. There's no point reinventing the philosophical wheel...-- Robert Merkel  21:54, 15 January 2006 (UTC)                           Philosophy covers anything that isn't already covered by some science. Which is a rather broad area, to put it mildlyÂ :) . So when you do philosophy, what are the chances that you come up with a subject that has already been covered by a previous philosopher? So reading those books will have the effect limiting your thoughts to those subjects. This may (and for many people does) go so far that you think that that is all that philosophy is about. I'm certainly not saying that those books are not worth reading. But to understand them you have to be a bit of a philosopher yourself. And for that you must have first freed your mind by taking that step back and doing some original thinking. Ideally, that would be an iterative process, going back and forth between reading and thinking. Too many people, however, are stuck in the reading bit, taking the words of Plato and the like for gospel (who in turn, by the way, mostly just regurgitated what he had heard from Socrates). Oh, and as soon as some idea has been refuted by someone you're in the realm of proofs and certainties and therefore science and not philosophy. Alright, that's a bit strong, but there is an element of truth in it. I mean there are no certainties in philosophy. And. like I said, to understand the books, it helps to have thought about it for yourself (even if your conclusions may be 'wrong' - whatever that is).

Bush  by a journalist when he was running for President; the purpose of the question was as a  litmus test  of rudimentary foriegn policy expertise. It would be a perfectly reasonable question to ask of somebody who is applying for a job in defence-related foriegn affairs; for instance, somebody who wanted to work in sales for an arms manufacturer. The morality of such a profession is something you might quibble with, but it's perfectly legal in most Western countries and a growing number of other ones with indigenous arms industries; India's, for instance. -- Robert Merkel  09:41, 16 January 2006 (UTC)   It would also be a reasonable question to ask an aspiring political journalist, or a recruit to the diplomatic or intelligence services.

I believe he's referring to just straight 8. In which case, no. You can't spot the eight ball in eight ball. That's a mortal sin. There are only two times you can win in eight-ball if you sink it: one is on the break (an automatic win), and the other is when you call the shot (""eight ball, side pocket"") and all your balls (stripes/solids) are off the table.  If you pocket the eight-ball at any other time, it's an automatic loss.  At least, that's how I was taught to play.

I had heard that snakes were totally deaf. It turns out they can hear, just not very well. They are most sensitive to frequencies around 200-300 hertz, and whistling is a few octaves higher than that, so they may not be able to hear it at all.

They aren't blind.  StuRat  10:08, 16 January 2006 (UTC)         As I understand it, cobras will be ""at ease"" if you are far away and will strike at the nearest moving object if you are close enough. However, there is a range between these two distances where they rise and prepare to strike the nearest moving object, but wait for it to move into range. By keeping in this distance range you can keep them in their raised stance for quite a while. For safety, it makes sense to have an inanimate object closest to the snake, so it will strike that, instead of you, if you get too close. Using a flute as the object gives the fun illusion that the cobra is being ""charmed by the music"", especially when they ""dance"" to the flute as they turn to face the moving flute to improve their striking ability.  StuRat  10:06, 16 January 2006 (UTC)     Conversely I saw a documentary where the snake charmers had ripped out the fangs of the cobras, rendering their bite nearly harmless.-- Commander Keane  10:33, 16 January 2006 (UTC)           Hmm, maybe we should rip some part off of politicians bodies to make them harmlessÂ ?

StuRat  12:17, 16 January 2006 (UTC)           That is broadly the meaning, but the actual technical meaning is very much more complicated, because of the way the web works. For instance, suppose you look at a web page with two frames, a style sheet and three pictures. The first time you visit that page there will be 8 separate connections to the web site (for the page, the two frames, the style sheet, and the three pictures). So the count of connections versus pages is important: some people will inflate their hit count by counting connections. But what happens next time? Well, if you look at the same page in an hour's time there will probably be  no  connections. Next day, maybe your computer will check to see if the page or other files have changed, maybe not. So displaying the page  again  might or might not count as a hit. Some software tries to account for these multiple requests for the same page from the same computer, to count ""real"" different viewers (people). But all they have is the IP address, and that might be used by more than one person. In the case of someone like AOL who uses proxy servers, there may be thousands of people seeing a page but only one request. Bottom line: hit counts are interesting, and are an  indication  of how popular a page is. But they are not an exact measure.  Notinasnaid  12:57, 16 January 2006 (UTC)                   Actually, they're more of an indication of how popular the pages that link to them are, at least in as far as it concerns people who follow such a link. Once there, they may decide it's not what they wanted (of course, this depends on how you define 'popularity'). Popularity of the page itself would be indicated by returning visitors - ie the 'multiple requests' you're talking about.

This kitten is long-haired, grey and white (patchy) with a long bushy tail and it has big blue eyes. It has a very odd doubt tuft of hair growing out of each of it's ears and a friend told my mother that this cat is a very rare breed. The cat was purchased at the local Humane Society and we cannot find out if it really is ""a type"". All I know is that my mother loves ""Baby"" and Baby is a very sweet cat. Is there anything in what I've given you that could help you figure out if it does come from a particular breed?   Many thanks. Catherine Stuart Email: cstuart at hydro dot mb dot ca     Do you have a picture of the cat you could link to, just to help reduce the possibilities?  GeeJo   (t)   (c)      20:19, 16 January 2006 (UTC)       You might have a look at our  List of cat breeds  to see if anything matches. Note that even if your cat resembles, and seems to have parentage from a specific breed, without a written pedigree recording its ancestry back several generations it's not going to be valuable for commercial breeding, but that in no way affects Baby's ability to be a loving pet! By the way, feral cats are a major environmental and animal welfare problem in many places; you should strongly consider getting your mother's cat desexed. -- Robert Merkel  04:25, 17 January 2006 (UTC)       ""grey and white with big blue eyes"" sounds a lot like the new  Blue Peter  kitten  Socks  who's a  ragdoll  (long hair and bright blue eyes are their trademark).

Problem is, I still don't understand how to set a new category to put it in, or how to make a new page that I could paste it into. How?   Please read the directions above and ask this question at the  WP:Help desk , which is full of people eager to help you with question about how to do things here and how wikipedia works.  alteripse  22:37, 16 January 2006 (UTC)     To avoid having to repaste the question, you need to add [[Category:Foo]] to an article to put it into a category, and by convention it's typically put at the end of the text. To find the most appropriate/specific category to add it to, have a look around related categories and see where they branch out, or see what categories that related articles have been put into (avoid creating new, overly-specific categories if you can help it.) As to creating a new page, just search for a topic by entering it into the search bar. If we don't have an article on it, you'll get a prompt asking if you want to create one. Hope that helps!  GeeJo   (t)   (c)      23:40, 16 January 2006 (UTC)           Also, it's not required that every article be categorized. You could create the article without a category.

[ edit ]   not sure   In a computer class do not understand converting words to bytes or how many bytes are contained in a word. For instance how many bytes in the words Genaral Ledger? Is each letter a bit I know it takes 8 bits to make a byte so since there are 13 letters would this be 1 byte?     One bit is only enough information to distinguish between two possibilities. There are more than two letters, so each letter must be more than a bit.  ASCII  and many other character encodings use one byte per letter, but not always.  Keenan Pepper  04:49, 17 January 2006 (UTC)       If ""Genaral Ledger"" were a C-style string it would contain the characters 'G', 'e', 'n', 'a', 'r', 'a', 'l', ' ', 'L', 'e', 'd', 'g', 'e', 'r', and the terminating '\0', so it would be 15 bytes long.  Keenan Pepper  04:55, 17 January 2006 (UTC)           For further information, see  bit ,  byte ,  word (computer science) , and  character encoding . -- Robert Merkel  05:06, 17 January 2006 (UTC)       EBCDIC , which is an alternative to  ASCII , has 16 bits in a byte. Then there are 64 bit systems. That space between General and Ledger is also a byte in most every system I know. Now  General Ledger  is the name of a type of  accounting application  which can contain millions of bytes.  User:AlMac | (talk)  09:57, 17 January 2006 (UTC)               This is kind of getting off track, but the EBCDIC I learned was a character code with no more than 256 positions, and was normally stored in 8-bit bytes. Variations for character code length include UCS-2 (a kind of Unicode) with 16 bytes, CDC display code with 6 bytes, and UTF-8, with a variable number of bytes between 1 and 6. But this doesn't really help to explain the original question. Let's try this...   Characters are really numbers. There are different lists of numbers used, but for instance, number 32 is a space in many lists, and 65 is a letter ""A"". When you put these numbers in a computer, they need a certain amount of space. The most common systems used in English-speaking countries have 256 characters in all, numbered from 0 to 255. Numbers from 0 to 255 can be all stored in 8 bits. On most modern computers, 8 bits is a byte. Except for the idea that characters are really numbers, any of these things are just examples, and may be different. Why? Well, think about the Japanese, who have tens of thousands of characters: they will need a different system. That's probably enough for now. There's a lot more to be said: I have an 1100 page book on the subject in front of me, and that only covers Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese.  Notinasnaid  10:17, 17 January 2006 (UTC)   Oops, I  still  didn't answer the question about words. Well, words are usually made up of bytes. I have used computers with 2, 4, 8 or 10 bytes per word. So to find out how many words a string uses you must (1) find out how many bytes for that string (2) find out how many bytes in a word (3) divide one by the other, rounding the result up.  Notinasnaid  10:19, 17 January 2006 (UTC)    Then there is also  Huffman coding , which uses different numbers of bits for different letters. Common letters use fewer bits, so an average text will get shorter than if coded with  ASCII .  217.208.26.177  22:02, 21 January 2006 (UTC)                   [ edit ]   Why is it called an iPod?

[ edit ]   lp cleaning   I've been cleaning lp's with a disco-antistat cleaning kit, but using a mix of demineralised water and washing up liquid (Dubro). I've cleaned about 60 lp's in three batches, with overall good results. But one lp still had that easily recognisable crackling noise that dust gives. So I played it wet and it sounded just fine. So I gave it another bath, this time with just demineralised water. That seemed to improve things a bit, but the result was nowhere near as good as playing wet (which gave hardly any noise). So I tried two more baths, each time with more washing up liquid, because without that, the water sticks to the lp, not dripping off well enough (it needs to drip because else it will evaporate and leave the dust on the lp). With no improvement. This is driving me nuts. How can all other lp's be just fine and this one not? And how can there still be dust (or what else could it be?) on the lp after four baths? Bathing should have the same effect as playing wet, right? The album is 'No heavy petting' by UFO (1976), Chrysalis records, printed in Germany (Phonogram). I see nothing else on the lp to distinguish it from others.  DirkvdM  10:58, 17 January 2006 (UTC)     In the world of IT,  rubbing alcohol  seems to do the trick on just about anything.  WD-40  is also a possibility, but I've never cleaned LP records before. (Though it may make sense to try WD-40; while it is a lubricant, it might make the LP stay ""wet"" in a sense...  Cernen   Xanthine   Katrena  11:07, 17 January 2006 (UTC)    WD-40 makes a bad lubricant. I know, tons of people use it as one but there are better lubricants. And the WD stands for ""water displacement"" so it would keep water off the records and still keep that ""wet"" feeling. Although it will trap dust and dirt. That's one of the major drawbacks of using it as a lubricant.  Dismas | (talk)  11:55, 17 January 2006 (UTC)               I'd say  any  lubricant is bad because the needle has to be in as direct a contact with the groove as possible. And it's an oil, meaning dust would stick to the record, which is baaaad (the article even states that it collects dust). The idea is to remove  everything  from the surface. To clarify; after bathing I hang up the record on a steel bar (through the hole) to let it  drip  dry (not evaporate, because that would leave a residue). But the point is that the washing up liquid bath works fine for all records except this one. And the treatment should work as well as playing wet, shouldn't it?  DirkvdM  12:37, 17 January 2006 (UTC)           For old, out of print recordings, I recommend not living in the US, and using a gnutella variant on the Internet. Most likely some audio hobbyist has made a clean recording off the vinyl. If you are a fanatic, you might have to look for the 24 bit stuff. -- Zeizmic  14:07, 17 January 2006 (UTC)     Thanks for all the tips, but the question was meant more theoretical, or how should I put that. Let me rephrase it. If I've thoroughly cleaned the lp, then what on Earth can cause the crackling? I bought the lp 2nd hand, so might it be that the previous owner somehow caused loads of tiny scratches (which I can't see, by the way), and, if so, how does playing the lp wet stop them from crackling?  DirkvdM  15:51, 17 January 2006 (UTC)     Presumably through the water filling out the cracks. Which means that it's also filling out the grooves which are intended to be there, and you'll have a loss of fidelity. Basically the same effect as a low-pass filter. -- BluePlatypus  16:23, 17 January 2006 (UTC)           I thought about that too, but the low-pass filter effect would indeed follow from it, and that makes it rather unlikely because some audio freaks play all their records wet. Could be snobism, but then the real experts would point that out and I've done a fair bit of reading on the subject a few years ago and I would surely have come across any comments on that. Which I haven't.

And they added a ninth month (november, after 'novem' for 'nine') and a tenth month (december, from  deca ). Somehow these came to be our 11th and 12th month.  DirkvdM  13:40, 17 January 2006 (UTC)    And we've got 365 days in a year because of the Egyptians - that was the average time between the risings of this one star, and the one star rose every time the Nile was about to flood.

Is there something that you like to read about, study, or pontificate about? It can be silly, like ""how to brew beer so that it has more bubbles"" or ""the ancient history of toilets."" As long as it's something where you would actually enjoy the long hours of figuring out what has been undocumented by scholars and then documenting it, then you can get a doctorate in it. -- Mareino  19:03, 17 January 2006 (UTC)       You can't just 'do a doctorate', you need an undergraduate degree first. And it'll usually need to be in that field to qualify you for postgraduate studies. Spending years studying something just because you want nothing but a title is silly. (And unheard of. None of the PhDs I know even use their title outside of academic contexts.) Titles have no value in themselves. -- BluePlatypus  19:34, 17 January 2006 (UTC)       Would it have to be a British degree? Maybe in some countries you can more easily get one.

Many thanks JW     [ edit ]   Tracking   Is it possible to track an persons address from his IP Address? or how closely is it possible(country,county,city?).  unsigned question by  User:Jonoleth     IP addresses are all registered to a particular organisation, and the registration information is often public. A lot depends on the organisation. For example, if the IP address belonged to a company with offices in only one place, and with people working there using the internet, this will tell you where they work. The company itself might or might not be able to identify an individual. By contrast, if the address is shown as belonging to AOL, this may tell you nothing except that the person is an AOL subscriber (probably in a specific country); AOL may have detailed logs identifying the person who was using a particular IP address at a given time.  Notinasnaid  18:09, 17 January 2006 (UTC)           In the middle of those two extremes are companies like  Verizon  which have regional  NOCs . For instance, my IPs always trace to Reston, VA.

Why not 10mm or 8mm? wsc       It's a  common bullet design  that's achieved popularity, and since it works well, we keep using it. There are larger bullets out there, but they have correspondingly greater recoil; a .45 or 10mm kicks much more than a 9mm. A .40 S&W is basically a reduced power 10mm, for lower recoil and reduced stress on the gun. A smaller bullet like an 8mm would probably carry much less power, especially at the (relatively) low velocities that a handgun produces.  .32 ACP  is one 8mm pistol cartridge out there.       There's an enormous logistical inertia connected to any cartridge in military service. 9mm is the NATO standard and not likely to go away soon.  .30-06  stuck around for almost 50 years. It's the economics of volume. The common nature of the bullets makes them cheap to buy and popular to use, and their popularity in guns leads to greater volumes of manufacture and lower cost.

I strongly suggest you reword this question, because I have no idea what you're asking. I'll give a punt, but I can't guarantee anything.   Now, is  Unreal Tournament  the most HD-space-hungry computer game? Answer: I'd don't think so.  F.E.A.R.  I think has since taken the record, if the distribution medium is anything to go off; however that is set to change as  artificial intelligence  engines, like the  Unreal Engine , become more sophisticated, and therefore requiring more memory and more HDD space to store the AI code. -- JB Adder  |  Talk  11:54, 18 January 2006 (UTC)    I'm not even sure that FPS games are the most HD-space-hungry; I haven't installed FEAR, so I don't know how much HD space it actually uses, but from my experience, commercial Flightsims like MSFS or Xplane take up much more HD space than shooters - not because the code is so complicated but because the sheer amount of terrain data is so huge. If you count third-party add-ons, an installation of MSFS can grow well beyond 10GB in no time at all --  Ferkelparade     14:09, 18 January 2006 (UTC)    AI Code is  nothing  when it comes to the amount of hard drive space a game needs. Millions of lines of code are still just a few tens of megabytes compiled. They may need more RAM to load and calculate, but that's not the question. The single largest space consumer is the art, especially high resolution, high quality textures, which can easily take up several megabytes just for the data to create a single 3d model. With the growing size and detail level of environments, graphics are going to be the big driver of space requirements.

Â :-)  hydnjo   talk  19:48, 17 January 2006 (UTC)           Terminology is a bit tricky here. GeeJo's answer is about the common usage, but strictly speaking they've got a capitalist economy, like pretty much any country in the world. Even the Netherlands; despite the many socialist 'corrections', the basis is still capitalist (ie we've got a liberal (free) market system). The Ukraine used to have a socialist ecomomy when it was part of the USSR. See  socialism . Particularly the second line; Communist economies don't exist (yet?) on a national scale. The largest scale example of that would probably be Israel's  kibbutzim . Impress your teach with that bit of wisdom!  DirkvdM  21:00, 17 January 2006 (UTC)           Terminology isn't really that tricky if people would stop confusing political terms with economic ones.Â :) I'd put it this way: There are free markets, regulated markets and planned economies, and they form a spectrum from the 100% free to the 100% planned. Politically, the right favors more free markets and the left favors more regulated markets. -- BluePlatypus  09:56, 18 January 2006 (UTC)         But in many non-Anglo-Saxon countries the political right doesnt like business getting too much power, so favours more political control as well.

Many websites make the claim that  Lombard Street  in  San Francisco, California , is the windiest street in the world (""windiest"" as in ""lots of twists and turns"", not as in ""gusty and breezy""). I see that our own article on that street doesn't make such a grand claim, stating instead that Lombard Street is the ""crookedest [most winding] street in the United States"". But is that even true? What  is  the crookedest street in the world? In the United States? My own vote has to go to the highway that leads south of  Ebolowa ,  Cameroon , to the border with  Gabon .  Switchback  after switchback, apparently so that the Cameroonian military can hide just out of sight in case the Gabonese army decides to invade. But, then, it's a  highway , so maybe it doesn't count. Any objective sources on this topic?   BrianSmithson  20:08, 17 January 2006 (UTC)     Lombard isn't even the crookedest street in San Francisco; Vermont St. has one fewer curves, but they're all a lot sharper and steeper. No pretty flowers, though. -- jpgordon   21:02, 17 January 2006 (UTC)       Wellington  is also known as 'windy city'. Which street would be windiest, I haven't a clue. As for crooked streets, old European cities made their streets crooked deliberately to slow down invading armies. And Amsterdam's canals make a half circle. But in the sense of winding streets, ones that make long steep climbs would probably qualify best. Maybe the  Khyber pass ? And then there's always the 'long and winding road that leads to your door'. Don't know where that is, though, probably somewhere in Liverpool.Â :)  DirkvdM  21:04, 17 January 2006 (UTC)\    Can't speak for the world, but  Melbourne  is by far the windiest place in  Australia  in my experience, and the non-Paris end of Collins St is easily the windiest place in Melbourne I know of.  JackofOz  21:21, 17 January 2006 (UTC)         I have a question also. I was told by a science professor that Perth, Western Australia is the second windiest city after Chicago. Is this true or just some made up informtion to keep the students interested?     I would have thought Mexico City would be the windiest city, based on the number of inhabitants and quantity of refried beans consumed there.

You could also address the problem outside of the religious scope if you wish. Thanks.   Raul Ovalle. Dominican Republic     Have a look at this[ [40] ]. -- Goshawk  20:54, 17 January 2006 (UTC)       Yup, that's an old joke. (well, to me anyway..) In any case the existence of  Hell  is rather disputed. Judaisim didn't really have one, and neither did early Christianity (One of the early fathers of the church,  Origen  flat-out denied it). So there certainly isn't any proper Canon as to the thermodynamic nature of hell. As quoted in the Hell article, Pope JP2 said:  Hell indicates the state of those who freely and definitively separate themselves from God, the source of all life and joy. , so you could, I suppose, interpret that as an  ""isolated system""  in thermodynamic terms. -- BluePlatypus  21:00, 17 January 2006 (UTC)           Hmm, not 'after they die'? So they (including me) are already in hell? So hell is here on Earth? And if I'm already in hell, then what did the poor buggers in war zones and natural disaster areas do wrong? Or might that be heaven? Does God have a sense of humour we don't get?  DirkvdM  07:45, 18 January 2006 (UTC)           Cool, I agree with BluePlatypus! I think the answer to  DirkvdM' s question requires taking the Pope's definition of  hell  at face value. The Pope meant hell is a state of spritual isolation AND ALSO NOT a physical location with  brimstone  and armies of darkness and such. So those of us who are living in comfort but nevertheless feeling spiritually unsatisfied are in hell (or are hell-bound, I'm not really sure which the Pope meant), but the people in, say,  Sudan , who live in a world that rather resembles the American pop-culture hell, are not living in  metaphysical  hell (unless they, too, are feeling spiritually detached, which must be a great  temptation ). They are still miserable, but the Christian God seems to have no problem with the ""bad things happen to good people"" conundrum that makes us mortals very confused; see  Book of Job . -- Mareino  13:39, 18 January 2006 (UTC)               You have to estimate the amount of fuel needed to burn all the dead people since hell came into action. Still, they shall burn a very long time without disappearing in ashes. Then make an assumption wether hell is isolated or not from the rest of the universe (a black holeÂ ? the center of earthÂ ?), and so on. Good luck.   Can't believe people believing in some hell. It makes the question of God's benevolence and power too hard. Wouldn't  Occam  stir in his seat in Paradise with such unnecessary concepts. -- DLL  22:28, 18 January 2006 (UTC)                           That's not hard to believe. If there is a personification of good, then there should also be a personification of bad. Unless the two are rolled into one. Actually, the mediaeval God was a bit of that (in the sense of being the judge, although he left the dirty part of job to the Devil). And why not a personification of all sorts of qualities and phenomena. Most religions seem to have that. I'd say it's rather the concept of one good God without at least one counterpart that's 'unnatural'. Why is it that monotheism has taken off so strongly. Understanding that would give a good insight into the human mind. By the way, funny, it's 'God' and '  the  Devil'. Never noticed that before. If there's only one Devil, then why not just 'Devil'?  DirkvdM  08:09, 19 January 2006 (UTC)    More than one Devil. Technicaly, it's more like a title. Think of Lucifer and Beelzebub and Satan and all the rest.    I said that wrong, I meant that 'the' should be dropped if it's a name, like 'God'. That would also explain the capitalisation. But if there are so many devils (as with 'gods', the plural is supposedly not to be capitalised), then how can it be 'the' Devil? Aren't those just different names for the same guy (girl?)?  DirkvdM  07:42, 21 January 2006 (UTC)    It makes more sense if you do this: replace 'Devil' with 'King'. All those entities were 'Kings' of Hell, i.e., the 'Devil'. And I don't think that they're interchangable, but some people do. It's a matter of opinion. Maybe someday I'll read the Bible and find out if I'm right.                               It's worth remembering that some descriptions of Hell (such as Dante's) include both fiery and frozen regions, so in those decriptions there may be equilibrium.

Safety matches  was a Swedish invention, and they held a worldwide monopoly. See also  Ivar Kreuger . There are some nice pictures  here  of some of the various brand-names they were sold under (webpage of the Matchstick Museum in Jnkping).

We opened up the window in order to allow the fumes out. Is this considered adequate ventilation? I'm concerned about lead poisoning.  KeeganB     If the  solder  was was purchased in the last 20 years or so, it probably didn't contain any lead at all. In any event, the heat that your dad used to solder a few wires melted the soldering alloy but was not sufficiently hot so as to vaporize any significant amount of the the metals within the alloy. The smoke that was produced was a result of vaporizing the  flux  that was included within the soldering material.  hydnjo   talk  05:35, 18 January 2006 (UTC)    In other words, we aren't doctors but we think that you should be fine.  Dismas | (talk)  05:52, 18 January 2006 (UTC)         I know for sure it was lead solder. My dad refuses to use anything else; according to him lead-free solder is inadequate for certain things.  KeeganB         If you're not puking, or showing signs of cancer, then my guess is you're a-okay. If you can still smell something, chances are you should put a fan up against the window facing outwards to blow out anything residual. I do this to air out my room every once in a while.

Solid lead is believed to present a relatively low hazard to health, but it is a cumulative poison, and can cause serious harm if inhaled as a powder, or ingested over a long period. . So as long as you ventilate and don't eat it, it should be safe. -- BluePlatypus  11:38, 18 January 2006 (UTC)         There is no lead exposure, but I think solder fume is on par with ciggie smoke.

Sorry, I wasn't more specific -- I'm researching the impact of this alien species in the UK. It seems there are conflicting views on this subject, especially regarding  fish farms . I'm also interested in whether self-sustaining communities of trout in the UK -- in rivers, ponds and reservoirs where they haven't been introduced for sport -- have had a negative impact on water ecology.

AllanHainey  12:40, 18 January 2006 (UTC)                           I would expect the rainbow trout to partially or fully displace the brown trout, if they occupy the same ecological niche.

Jayant, 17 Years, India | (Talk)  14:37, 18 January 2006 (UTC)           The original meaning of the word ""state"" is ""country"". It has come to also mean province in some countries, such as the US and Australia. I assume they meant the original meaning, or country, as asking how many provinces there are in the world is a weird question to pose.  StuRat  14:43, 18 January 2006 (UTC)                   Searching for a true definition of a state. Houses of representativesÂ ? US states got them. Own's moneyÂ ? EU countries share the Euro. Seat in the UNÂ ? Some won't. Being  sovereign  is vague. Capacity to enter into relations with the other states, as in the  Montevideo Convention Â ? Some other states won't speak with you! Just search for friends, a territory, a flag, and create a government, you'l have one more. -- DLL  21:50, 18 January 2006 (UTC)                   On the other hand, if ""states"" is meant in the sense where it is equivalent to ""provinces"", or administrative divisions of a country in general, then  this page  on the  CIA World Factbook  web site is may be useful. To get a proper total would require examining each entry to extract the correct detail, which I leave to the original poster if interested; but just stripping out some obviously irrelevant things like dates and adding up the remaining numbers in the file, I get a total of 4,637. It seems likely enough that the true answer is somewhere above 2,500, anyway. --Anonymous, 00:20 UTC, January 19, 2006.         There is no one true answer, because of the different definitions you can use. Even if you're talking about countries, rather than subnational states (like, say, Oklahoma), you'll get a different answer depending on your definition. There are 191 UN members, but there are some internationally recognised countries that aren't members (like the Vatican City). then there are countries which have only limited recognition, either for political reasons (like  Turkish Cyprus  and  Somaliland ) or because they only have nominal independence (like  Wales  or  Guam ). An approximate answer would be between 191 and about 220 (for what it's worth, both the Olympics and FIFA have 203 member nations - and not entirely the same 203!). If you mean ""states"" as in the 50 subregions of the US, then you have even more problems, because not all countries call their subdivisions states - there are provinces, oblasts, wilayas, counties, departements, lander, cantons... this one may simply be unanswerable.

Of the Wikipedia articles on individual lakes, only those on Lakes Superior and Huron seem to provide that figure. Are corresponding figures available for Lakes Michigan, Erie and Ontario?     As coastlines and shorelines have  Hausdorff dimension  between 1 and 2, the length will vary according to which resolution you use. If you use a map with higher resolution, you will see more small irregularities like bays and peninsulas, and get a longer shoreline.

Is there any good schools there? And even so, could I pull it off as a westerner?  Pacific Coast Highway | Spam me!  16:57, February 18, 2009 ( UTC )     London is positively crammed with good universities (which is what you will have to learn to call them if you go there).  Imperial College London  is world class; so is  London School of Economics . Most of the others are pretty good: see  University of London . However you should be aware that old Polytechnics (what you in the US would call Community Colleges) also call themselves universities. You should have no more difficulty there then anyone else studying on a foreign country.  DJ Clayworth  22:07, 18 January 2006 (UTC)           Thanks, or cheers (I hope I got it right).

Bloody Yanks... *grin*   And as for  ""can I pull it off as a westener"" , I presume you mean you're from the West Coast of the US, in which case I doubt you'll have many problems, as they speak more or less the same language in London as you do. Depending on your social attitudes, you  may  find London much more hectic than the US West Coast, but that's obviously a gross overgeneralisation, especially as London is more of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world. Note that you'll have to go through the  UCAS  university admissions system, which is how places at UK universities are allocated, and you'll need to submit your application about nine months before your intended starting date (so, for instance, by December 2006 for a September 2007 start). Degrees in the UK work slightly differently than in the US, you tend to read only one subject (as opposed to taking ""major"" and ""minor"" classes), but I doubt the differences are anything you can't handle. Do some reading up on how the admissions process works, decide on what subject(s) you're interested in, and go for it. Best of luck!

Despite their apparent high levels of technology, there isn't really anything on show that replaces nuclear technologies. Ships, for example, tend to engage at extraordinarily close ranges, and still MISS! - a nuclear missile armed space shuttle would stand a good chance against an Imperial Destroyer. It is more likely that the Star Wars universe simply uses different laws of physics, which prohibit nuclear weapons, whilst somehow allowing sound to travel in a vacuum.-- Fangz  04:08, 19 January 2006 (UTC)             Perhaps Lucas doesn't believe in Nukes, and how would have anyone reacted to the use of nukes in the 1970's     I'm not familiar with the SW universe, but is it possible that all the technologically advanced races discovered an easy way to generate a field that suppresses fission and fusion reactions? If such a device became routine defensive armament, then no one would bother carrying nukes as an offensive weapon, because they'd so often be useless.  JamesMLane  06:25, 19 January 2006 (UTC)       ""Because it's fiction"" is not a good enough reason? -- Nelson Ricardo  07:10, 19 January 2006 (UTC)    Excellent point. It's one thing to debate these discrepancies in  hard science fiction  but another entirely to expect to find rational explanations for  space opera .   Lomn   Talk  13:46, 19 January 2006 (UTC)                   It could be that Star Wars races never went in that direction; in  War of the Worlds , the aliens never discovered the wheel, and they seemed to do alright (although I question how the striders work without any wheels of any kind, but that's off topic).  s murray inch e ster ( User ), ( Talk )  15:01, 19 January 2006 (UTC)             You just have to suspend disbelief and accept the Star Wars universe as is. The same is true in just about all science fiction. Since the trend in combat has been for combatants to be farther and farther away (at least in all out war, if not in low level conflicts), I would expect this trend to continue. An all out war today would be fought with nuclear weapons on ICBMs launched from around the world. In the future, perhaps combatants will be in adjacent solar systems, each hiding behind their respective stars to prevent their immediate destruction via particle weapons. They could launch periodic weapons ships from behind the star to detect and destroy any enemy ship not hidden behind that system's star. Also, alien races always have nearly identical military capabilities whenever they meet in science fiction. In reality, there would likely be millions of years of development difference between them. Why don't science fiction wars reflect any of thisÂ ? Because it would be boring to watch, of course.  StuRat  23:19, 19 January 2006 (UTC)   Don't know if anyone will ever read this, but in addition to the above, note that a civilization would have to have either  uranium  or  plutonium  in significant amounts to even think of nuclear weapons and technologies. Both of these elements are rare (elements 90 and 92 on the periodic table).  Captain Jackson  18:47, 22 January 2006 (UTC)     Good point. I suppose we could just assume those elements don't exist in usable quantities in the Star Wars universe. That might be easier than changing the rules of physics to make nuclear weapons impossible.

Some shows have the name and picture of several actors, and then the very last credit shows both the name of the actor and the role he or she plays. What is up with that?  Roman Soldier  16:06, 19 January 2006 (UTC)     Placement in the credits may be part of an actor's contract. Other than that, I'm not sure what you're asking.   Lomn   Talk  16:35, 19 January 2006 (UTC)     Example:   The All-American Television Show     Actor 1's name   Actor 2's name   Actor 3's name   Actor 4's name   Actor 5's name   Actor 6's name   Actor 7's name   Actor 8's name  as This Character     So why is Actor 8's character so important (ususually not the main character) that we need to know his or her role?  Roman Soldier  16:46, 19 January 2006 (UTC)     Perhaps Actor 8 is being introduced, i.e. it's their first major work. Just a thought.   I imagine it ends up being one of two cases:    It's a big-name actor who may lack the screen time of other actors but adds recognition to the series (Martin Sheen on  The West Wing  is an example of this; his character's name isn't used but he's broken off the regular cast name progression as a special case)   It's a contractual sop to balance the ego/viewership of being the last name on the list. I would imagine lots of people go grab a snack when the credits hit, as they know a commercial break follows, so the last name in the list gets seen least. Making it stand out in any fashion might improve overall name recognition.       However, these are just guesses. I've got no idea as to specific references or actual rationales.   Lomn   Talk  18:09, 19 January 2006 (UTC)    Star Trek: TNG used to do that with Whoopi Goldberg. They'd go so far as to remove her from even the main title credits, tacking her on to the end of the Guest Star listings (even though she was often listed as being in every episode when she didn't have any lines). Could also be that their character is the least important, and so they list it to remind them who it is.  Cernen   Xanthine   Katrena  21:26, 19 January 2006 (UTC)           On Law and Order shows, the Assistant DA (who is an important character) is always shown this way in the credits.    O_o Not really; the only law and order shows that do that are  Law and Order: Special Victims Unit  and  Law and Order: Criminal Intent . On  Law and Order  itself, it isn't done that way, probably because the ADAs are half of the show, whereas they are not featured nearly as much in the other two.  Cernen   Xanthine   Katrena  19:07, 20 January 2006 (UTC)       This is interesting. Didn't CSI used to do that with Eric Szmada (before he became a field CSI)? And didn't they do this with Robert David Hall?    It's a good question. They do this with Rachel Griffiths on  Six feet Under , too. I suspect it's partly an aesthetic thing - it leads the viewer into the show (okay, you've had the actors, but now remember they're characters!). It often seems to be a special features role, too - one of the main ones that you wold expect to be a bit further forward in the list.

In the documentation I see he uses a portable piano. I'm looking for a similar device too so I can practise if I'm not at home and in holidays. I've looked in the internet but all I can find are some rather unpractical keyboards ar very heavy stage pianos. What I am looking for should be portable, come with a protection case for transport, correct key dimensions and a good key action. Like the one I saw in the movie. If it also makes sound will probably not matter but would be nice to have (but only if it works with a rechargeable battery, because of transport).  helohe   (talk)  22:57, 19 January 2006 (UTC)     I once heavily research the digital portable pianos for my kids. The big money is all in the weighting and velocity response of the keys. Standard keyboards have a terrible response. I think it's something that you really have to try out. -- Zeizmic  23:27, 19 January 2006 (UTC)       Can't exist, I'd say. A good action requires weight (you need the inertia). And 88 small weights make for one big weight. You can't knock too much off the number of keys. Halve them and what's left is hardly a piano anymore. On top of that you want a sturdy (yes?) case. That means either weight or a very high price. If you find the product that proves me wrong, I'd be very interrested to know. I also play the piano and travel. And encountering a piano while travelling is something rare.  DirkvdM  07:19, 20 January 2006 (UTC)           It seems like the effect of weights can be mimicked in many ways, such as with springs and/or a compressible fluid. Another option might be to have some type of removable weights. Perhaps you could pour water into the piano, which would be delivered to the appropriate keys via channels, and then drained out after usage.  StuRat  09:20, 20 January 2006 (UTC)                   Neat solution, but a bit hard to do yourself. And you certainly wouldn't want water splashing around (it gets some heavy beating) in an electrical apparatus. Springs lack the effect of inertia of a weight; first, you get resistance, but then, once it's set in motion it continues while your finger moves elsewhere. The 'feel' is essentially different, facilitating fast playing. I never heard of the use of compressible fluids, but that would probably suffer the same problem.  DirkvdM  07:56, 21 January 2006 (UTC)               I have found a quite good one: The  Doepfer  PK88 . But it is quite expensive Euro 749.00 .  helohe   (talk)  23:24, 21 January 2006 (UTC)           And pretty heavy at 20 kg. Almost as heavy as my Roland A90 at 27 kg (which is a beauty for piano players who want to go digital, by the way). I surely wouldn't want to travel with that on my back. It weighs more than the rest of my luggage put together.

Please advise if you have any information. Thank You!~~!!~~     Take it to an appraiser.  Cernen   Xanthine   Katrena  06:30, 20 January 2006 (UTC)           US pennies at that time were made of bronze. Probably someone electroplated one side of this one, or even painted it; something like that. I have no idea why. As to value, coin collectors like their coins as close to original condition as possible, so it probably has no premium value beyond the value of the metal itself. --Anonymous, 07:22 UTC, January 20.               Do you mean an Indian coin or a U.S.A. Coin with the head of a native american on it?                   The general usage of 'Indian Head Penny' is the US coin featuring the Native American wearing a feather headdress thing on the obverse, and I think the words 'ONE CENT' on the reverse.                   also the original question said ""on the one cent side"". India has never used cents.  Grutness ... wha?  04:02, 21 January 2006 (UTC)                   I don't think they mean a coin from India, but rather a coin from the US. In 1906, US pennies had the face of a Native American (called an ""Indian"" in the US), on one side.  StuRat  04:23, 21 January 2006 (UTC)                   that's my point. If it's a one cent, it can't possibly be from India, so it is definitely a US 1906 one cent piece that's being talked about.  Grutness ... wha?  04:32, 21 January 2006 (UTC).

Gary Day Rocklin California     [ edit ]   Presidential Wiretapping   Why are people so concerned about wiretapping. If you have nothing to hide, you shouldn't worry about it.     See  privacy  and  Nineteen Eighty-Four  and  Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution  and so forth. -- Fastfission  04:55, 20 January 2006 (UTC)           See  secret police . And think very deeply about whether you truly have ""nothing to hide"". Ever said nasty things about your boss over the phone? Called your mistress on it? Neither of those things are illegal, but both would be very handy  blackmail  material. If you don't have ""something to hide"", either you've got  tenure  at Berkeley or you're lying. -- Robert Merkel  06:03, 20 January 2006 (UTC)                   Another aspect of wiretapping is that the info the President acquires can give him a level of power dangerous in a democracy. For example, if he knows the strategy of the opposing political party beforehand, he can almost guarantee winning every election. Then, if you add the ability to blackmail his political opponents based on what was learned, he can basically abolish democracy and rule as emperor.  StuRat  06:23, 20 January 2006 (UTC)                           Ah, but that works both ways, doesn't it? And when people start to find out all sorts of things about each other they'll get bored by yet another 'revelation' and stop caring. We'll simply get used to it and taboos will disappear. When it comes out that everyone breaks a certain taboo it's hardly a taboo anymore is it? This  does  require that  everyone  is 'watched' equally, and there is a potential problem there. But you get selective phone tapping and such only when it can only be done to a limited extent. So break the taboo on 'espionage' and the problem will go away because it's a problem that perpetuates itself. (I know this idea is controversial, but that only makes is more attractive to meÂ :) ).  DirkvdM  07:31, 20 January 2006 (UTC)                                   I don't see people ever getting bored with other's sexual antics. There will be plenty of variety, too. Some will be guilty of a simple foot fetish, while others will be adulterous, homosexual, into S&M, etc. Then there would be the illegal activities. If everyone who ever did drugs, went to a prostitute, had sex with an underage partner, etc. was imprisoned, the prisons would overflow. Perhaps in the long run this would force us to have more reasonable laws, but a short term crisis would still be the result.  StuRat  09:04, 20 January 2006 (UTC)                                       Ah, but life is one long successio of short term crises isn't it? And about the long run, do guys drool over naked breasts in a society where women walk around bare-breasted all the time?  DirkvdM  19:36, 21 January 2006 (UTC)                       Perhaps you should read about  J. Edgar Hoover . Did he ever use his authority for personal power? Did 'innocent' people have nothing to fear from him? How would you stop that from happening again? -- BluePlatypus  11:42, 20 January 2006 (UTC)           Yes, but since  J. Edgar Hoover  was a transvestite, all you would need would be a pic of him in some fish-net stockings, and you would have nothing to fear blackmailwise.  StuRat  11:55, 20 January 2006 (UTC)                   If that had been the case, then he would never have acquired the power he did - the press, the Mafia etc knew about his quirks, but he kept that kind of thing ruthlessly supressed, and noone in the media dared reveal anything.  Proto Â  t Â  c  14:12, 20 January 2006 (UTC)                   Actually the article on Hoover cites Mafia sources saying there never were any such pictures. And it doesn't really sound that probable to me since it smacks of the incorrect stereotype that homosexuals are transvestites and vice-versa. -- BluePlatypus  14:21, 20 January 2006 (UTC)                   I only said tranvestite, not homosexual. But, in any case, there are some who are both, so he might have been one of those.  StuRat  16:58, 20 January 2006 (UTC)                           I didn't mean to imply that you said that either. What I meant was that there were reasons to suspect the man was a homosexual, but that there weren't any reasons to assume he was a transvestite other than by assuming he was gay, and that all gays are transvestites. -- BluePlatypus  18:37, 22 January 2006 (UTC)                   ""If you have nothing to hide, you shouldn't worry about it.""

J I P  |  Talk  15:01, 20 January 2006 (UTC)       If you have nothing to hide, should you be upset by hidden video cameras in fitting-rooms at the clothing stores? Of course you should, because your nudity is something you have a reasonable right to expect control over. Likewise, you should reasonably expect to control the privacy of your personal communication unless  probable cause  to suspect you're up to something exists, and in that case an impartial third-party needs to authorize the spying. You might think that your naked body is much more private than your personal correspondence, but that's up to you. It should be up to me if I consider the privacy of my personal correspondence much more valuable than the mere view of my naked body. Telling people they have nothing to hide and therefore should not care is like telling an attractive woman that since she's so good-looking, she shouldn't care if anonymous observers are watching her undress without her knowledge or permission. --  Mitchell k dwyer  17:08, 20 January 2006 (UTC)     Despite  Godwin's Law , may I ask you wether Jews had anything to hide before there country was invaded by Germany? - guety is talking english bad  02:01, 21 January 2006 (UTC)     Just to refresh my memory, which nation was that of the Jews when it was invaded by Germany?

But 1/4 and 2/3?  DirkvdM  08:15, 20 January 2006 (UTC)     A lot of those double LPs you're talking about are lengthy classical pieces split into four sides. If you stack the two records, you can play side 1, and when the needle arm swings back at the conclusion of the side, the second LP would drop to the turntable (side 2). It does make more sense to have 1/3 and 2/4, because then you could just flip the stack over and then listen to 3 and 4 in that order, but I think the primary concern was just to make sure 1 and 2 were on separate records, and 3 and 4 were also on separate records. --08:58, 20 January 2006 (UTC)           Uh, you haven't used a turntable with a stack player lately, right? 1/4 and 2/3 is exactly what you want if the idea is to flip over the stack of two LPs, and that is why it was done. On the other hand, if they assumed that nobody would be stacking their LPs, then they'd pair the sides as 1/2 and 3/4. --Anonymous, 23:00 UTC, January 20.                   Oops. You're aboslutely right. It actually  has  been a long time since I did a classical show on college radio, and I wasn't envisioning the flip properly. Thanks. -- Mitchell k dwyer  04:27, 22 January 2006 (UTC)                       Unless the idea would be to play it all in one go, with two players, which would require 1/3 and 2/4. By the way, I've never used a stack player and don't really know how it works. The  phonograph  article doesn't mention it either, so maybe you could edit in your wisdom there.  DirkvdM  08:02, 21 January 2006 (UTC)               It's a very finished-looking article that seems to have been well researched and is written in excessively posh language. I ain't touchin' it to add sumthin' just based on my recollections.       With the stack player my parents had, instead of a short center post to put the records on, there was one about 4 inches high, with a pair of little prongs sticking out (like thorns, angled upwards) about an inch down. There was also a holder arm, (shaped like a backwardÂ ? with the curved part relatively small), mounted on a second vertical post to one side of the record. In its normal position its curve was hooked around the center post without touching it, but it was free to be lifted upward on the post, and in its highest position you could pivot it around the post and swing it to one side, clear of the area above the actual turntable.       To load the player, you first lifted the holder arm and swung it to the side. Then you put one or more records on the center post and let them slide down as far as the prongs. Since they were suspended in the air by their centers, they would now tend to tilt, but now you would swing the holder arm back in and lower it onto them, letting it lie on the top of the top record in the stack.       When you pressed the start control (or when the end of a record was reached and the tone arm had returned automatically to its start position), the prongs would retract for a moment and allow one record to drop to the turntable. I think there was a second pair of prongs that protruded at a slightly higher level during this process to keep more than one record from dropping, or something like that. Once the record dropped, then the tone arm would move back in and start playing it. When the last record dropped, the holder arm would finish in a position below the prongs and this would trigger a sensor that kept the mechanism from trying to start another record. Then when the record finished and the tone arm returned to its start position, the turntable would just switch itself off instead.       If you used the stacker, you had to use it even to play a single record. You also had the option of not using it, if it wouldn't work with your record (I think it wouldn't work with 78 RPM records because they were too thick, although we never had any 78's) or if you were afraid of it getting scratched. In that case you would lift out the center post and insert a short one without the mechanism. I think if you then used the normal start control it would detect that no record was stacked and would stop instead, so you had to move the tone arm onto the record by hand.       --Anonymous, writing entirely from memory, 18:25 UTC, January 21, 2006.

You know, the ones that look like they'd tip over backwards if too many people would sit in the back (I bet lots of US schoolkids have tried thisÂ :) ). How does a bus like that end up across the ocean? I've also seen old English doubledeckers, but it's rather a shorter distance across the channel. When in the US, I thought about sending the car I had bought there home by ship, but that turned out way too expensive (can't remember the price now). So wouldn't this be very uneconomical? Or would people spend a lot of money to own an 'oddity' like this? Ironically, in Cuba I saw Dutch buses. It turns out the Netherlands donated 1500 buses to Cuba. Speak of inefficiency. Florida buses get sent to the Netherlands and Dutch buses get sent to Cuba, which is just a raft's hop away from Florida (ok, that's a sick jokeÂ :) ).  DirkvdM  15:13, 20 January 2006 (UTC)     I don't have an answer for you, but I just wanted to add that an American schoolbus somehow ended up in  Cameroon , too.

I know that most TV shows depicting America are actually made there, but how it is glamourised/stereotyped/etc? A lot of shows seem to exaggerate the country they're set in ( Kath and Kim ,  'Allo 'Allo ,  All Aussie Adventures , etc).     Well, of course they make everything more interesting on TV. Violence especially is exaggerated and people don't all look like models in reality. Also, they tend to televise the rich far more than the poor or middle class.  StuRat  16:38, 20 January 2006 (UTC)           A related point is that such professions as doctor and lawyer are overrepresented in television programming.  JamesMLane  02:47, 21 January 2006 (UTC)           There are more people of color in the United States than on TV, and average people don't live in beachfront property or highrise penthouses.

As for how Americans differ from the stereotypes, people in Cameroon often thought that Western women were easy due to the high sexual content of a lot of European and American TV and movies.

But it will never tell you the representative story of what average daily life for the average citizen is like. Because ""everyone"" already knows what that's like. It doesn't make good TV. It's taken for granted. So the closest you'll get to that is when they parody it. -- BluePlatypus  19:04, 20 January 2006 (UTC)           Well, there's always  reality television  and  talk shows . Some of those are more ""reality"" than others, though. If  Oprah Winfrey  does a show on some family whose daughter was abducted, it's likely the family will be pretty normal (if likely white, upper-middle class). If  Jerry Springer  does a show on a 70-year-old stripper who's dating a man with  Down's syndrome , that's further from the norm.   BrianSmithson  19:46, 20 January 2006 (UTC)         Life everywhere is basically very similar, as far as I can tell. The avarage American, European, Israeli, Arab, orAsian all have very similar lives , and similar houses etc. There are often details on how things are arranged, and in some places trains are faster than planes (or vice versa), or people have more cars or less cars, more bikes or less. Homes can be single room appartments (New York) to wide stretching single floor homes with a swimming pool in the garden (melbourne, brisbane), to being set up on a mountainside with a view out to sea (parts of new zealand). If you watch films and movies, they depict all kinds of exciting things going on in what are ordinary humdrum, familiar environments.   It's rather more exciting to see godzilla or king kong trash that shopping center around the corner than it is to see them do their thing someplace you have never heard of.Â :-)   Things you can learn about cultures from movies are often things that go on in the background, or are incidental to the story. Like what people are eating or drinking, their manners during quiet parts of the movie, the layout of homes and buildings, what the roads look like, where people go to worship, or perhaps what they do to relax (though don't look at the main character, look at the extras.Â :-P)   Kim Bruning  20:07, 20 January 2006 (UTC)     I'm always amused at how, in US movies, there's always an available car space on the street right outside some major hotel, or corporate building, or court house (yeah, right..). The hero just drives right up and parks there, with no competition and no hassles. In the real world, parking outside the building would probably not be allowed at all. They'd have to look for a carpark, find one that wasn't full, drive around various levels for a while until they found a free bay, then walk to their destination. I know the movie hasn't got time to go through all that just for the sake of realism, but it's another example of how the truth of everyday life is not presented. See this sort of thing often enough, and the impression that gets ingrained is of relatively traffic-free and hassle-free American cities, when the truth is exactly the opposite.  JackofOz  21:06, 20 January 2006 (UTC)       Actually, most American buildings have free parking. It's only in downtowns of big cities -- or around malls on busy shopping days -- where you might actually have to look for a parking space. No one would consider opening a store or restaurant in the U.S. outside of a major downtown unless it had adequate parking. Can't expect people to walk more than a few feet, you know. --  Mwalcoff  04:15, 22 January 2006 (UTC)           It's also interesting how a car chase and shooting spree always happens yet never seems to attract any police attention.  StuRat  04:18, 21 January 2006 (UTC)    When there is a car chase, involving the police, they are often depicted as buffoons who don't know how to drive without crashing into lots of other cars and each other. Unrealistic there. Most any profession you are in,  hollywood  representation is more fantasy than reality.    Mmm-hmm.

User:AlMac | (talk)  05:00, 21 January 2006 (UTC)     American film and particularly television disproportionately depicts life in the coastal urban centres, particularly Los Angeles and New York, because that's where most of the TV studios are based and where the entertainment industries are run out of. LA and NY represent only a part of the United States - and amongst the wealthiest, most urbanised (or at least suburbanised), most multicultural, and most secular part. How often do you see TV dramas set in  Salt Lake City ,  Atlanta, Georgia ,  Detroit, Michigan , and so on? Furthermore, American television and film usually centre around upper middle class people - America is a wealthy country, but not that wealthy! -- Robert Merkel  05:19, 21 January 2006 (UTC)         Being from Detroit, I can name a few things set there. There's the Tim Allen sitcom  Home Improvement , the Martin Lawrence sitcom  Martin , the  Beverly Hills Cop  movies start in Detroit then move to Beverly Hills (they even used our former police chief, Gil Hill), the movie  Eight Mile  was set in Detoit, too, as Eight Mile Road is the northern boundary of Detroit. There are others, but those are the main ones that come to mind. Most are not filmed here, however, except for possibly a few shots near local landmarks.  StuRat  18:45, 25 January 2006 (UTC)           If a movie is set in a minor American city, it's probably filmed in Toronto! -- Zeizmic  14:28, 21 January 2006 (UTC)       Every American television show set in New York City shows all its characters living in apartments far larger than they could ever possibly afford in real life. -- Aaron  02:21, 22 January 2006 (UTC)           I saw this on a rerun episode of  Law and Order:Special Victims Unit  last night. A woman who had been raped wasn't able to deal with the rape and had quit her job (as a waitress) and moved out of her apartment. The police tracked her down to try to ID a suspect in the rape, and she was now living in a huge, expensive-looking apartment that she apparently had no job to pay for.  User:Zoe | (talk)  20:40, 22 January 2006 (UTC)                   Yea,  Friends  was one of the worst this way. Their apartments were in a very expensive part of town and no out-of-work actor, waitress, masseuse, etc., could afford them, even with roommates. Toward the end of the show, when Monica was a head chef, Rachel was a fashion buyer, Chandler was a Data Procesing Manager, Joey was a successful actor, and Ross was a professor/archeologist/paleontologist, they might have been able to pay rent. Phoebe, on the other hand, never could make rent (unless she was rubbing parts of men she wasn't supposed to rub, for extra tips).

Many Thanks Helen:-)         This question should be posted under the Language section. But, how about  ephemeral Â ? (I asssume you mean they died the actual day they were born, not on their birthday some years later.):               http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=ephemeral&r=66               StuRat  17:43, 20 January 2006 (UTC)           I assume the poster was referring to people who are born and have died on the same day  of the year . In that case, there's not a specific term in English, but we have a list of people who'd fall into that category at  List of people who died on their birthdays .  GeeJo   (t)   (c)    Â   17:46, 20 January 2006 (UTC)           Oh dear me, my tummy hurts. First there was the  List of U.S. Presidents by height order  and now this. To be complete, that list would include one in every 365 people who ever died. Even if you limit it to well known people it would be humongous. Who on Earth could be interrested in this? Or bother to compile such a list? JackofOz, what's up with this, mate? I suppose there's little else to do in the outback.Â :)  DirkvdM  18:41, 20 January 2006 (UTC)                   Ah, but it can't be one in 365 people who die, because there's both the day that they die on and the day they were born to consider. I read a similar thing once, with the statistics of a classful of little kids charting their birthadys (in Muse magazine, maybe you can find it). The problem is that once a day has been used, it's still available. Just because someone is born on a day doesn't mean that noone else can be born on that day.                           Uh, wrong. That's the  Birthday Paradox , which answers ""How many people do you need for it to be more likely than not that two share a birthday?"". That is not the same question as ""What is the probability that someone shares  my  birthday?"" which is essentially the same as ""What is the probability of someone sharing his birthday with his date of death?"", the question relevant here. -- BluePlatypus  21:12, 20 January 2006 (UTC)                                   I agree with DirkvdM and BluePlatypus. One in 365 is the correct ratio, if we ignore the complication of leap years and if we assume that a person's chance of dying on a particular day is independent of that person's birthday. If people are more likely to have heart attacks after riotous birthday parties, then the proportion of birthday diers could be higher than one in 365.  JamesMLane  02:37, 21 January 2006 (UTC)                                           Agreed, with a slight alteration to account for leap day. Those born on Feb 29 will be about 1/4 as likely to die on their birthday as others. Of course, the chances that any one person will have been born on any given non-leap day (say March 1) and also have died on that given day would be 365^2.  StuRat  03:55, 21 January 2006 (UTC)                       There are the  still born  as in babies who are born dead, but that is two words.  User:AlMac | (talk)  05:03, 21 January 2006 (UTC)    Actually  Stillborn  is one word.  GeeJo   (t)   (c)    Â  13:02, 21 January 2006 (UTC)         To DirkvdM particularly:     I guess you singled me out because I've made a few edits and improvements to the  List of people who died on their birthdays . I certainly can't claim credit for starting it, though. Anonymous user 130.37.24.11 did that, back in September 2003. I didn't come upon it till quite late in the piece, in 2005.   Clearly a number of people are interested in this list. That in itself is a good reason to have it. I've maintained my own list of such names for years, which is why I was able to update it with such apparent ease. If you don't find much use for it, live and let live and go and find something that does interest you. Wikipedia has enough for everybody.   I agree with those who say the probability of a person dying on their birthday is not 1/365 but 1/365 squared. Or more accurately, it's 1/365.2425 squared or 1/133,402.08. (I'd be happy to justify that number separately, for those who are interested.) This explains why the list is as short as it is. Its size is completely predictable by the mathematics.           I disagree. There are 43 people in the list, with 3 others listed as ""maybes"". If this was 1/(365^2) of the total number of famous people, that would give us almost 6 million famous people. If we use the correct 1/365, we get almost 16 thousand famous people. When we consider that many famous people from antiquity had unknown birthdates (and a few had unknown death dates), we can probably only do this check on half the famous people. And, beyond that, many people are just missing from the list. So, that might make the 16 thousand famous people far more, when those factors are accounted for.  StuRat  15:20, 21 January 2006 (UTC)                   OK, let's settle this. We're not talking about all the people who have ever died. We're talking about a much smaller subset of people, but the principles should still apply. Can anybody come up with:       the number of biographies we have on Wikipedia   of them, the number of dead people   of them, the number of people whose exact birth and death dates are known.       Comparing that last statistic with the 43-odd on the list would be very informative. It should either be roughly in the order of magnitude of 1/365, or roughly in the order of magnitude of 1/365 squared. If it's significantly different from either, then there's something wrong somewhere. I would have thought we had a lot, lot more than 16,000 biographies of dead people whose exact dates are known. But I agree it's way short of 6 million.  JackofOz  21:10, 21 January 2006 (UTC)               While nobody claims the list is complete, I would challenge anybody to come up with a  very well-known  name that's missing.   Australia  is one of the most culturally diverse nations on earth. I'm sure there's plenty to do in the  outback , otherwise why would people bother to live there. But I don't know much about it (maybe I should check out the  Wikipedia article  on it). I happen to live a thousand miles away, in  Melbourne , a wonderful home to over 3 million people, and twice independently rated as ""the world's most liveable city"". All stereotypes suck, and the less said about their perpetuators, the better.  JackofOz  05:53, 21 January 2006 (UTC)           Nah, the outback isn't as much as 1.609344 km from Melbourne. Hell, even  Waga Waga  is less than 500 km away, and that sounds outback enough to me.Â :)    Get it right, Dirk. (a) It's  Wagga Wagga . (b) 1.6 km is a lot, lot shorter than 500 km, so your maths is crap today. You probably meant 1.6  thousand  km. (c) What ""sounds like"" the outback to some guy in Amsterdam is not exactly the criterion Australians use. Maybe I'll start saying that the Netherlands has a windmill and a dyke on every street corner, and all Dutch people wear clogs. (d) I lived in Wagga for a while (the locals refer to it by one name), and I can assure you nobody there thinks it's in the outback. You'd need to go a lot further inland. I meant what I said when I said Melbourne was 1000 miles from the outback. Â :)  JackofOz  21:10, 21 January 2006 (UTC)    (a) Oops (b) Oops again (forgot to shift the decimal point) (c) Note the smileyÂ :) I  have  been to the Land of Aus, though. Also, a dike in every street (not just the corner) is not too far from the truth in Amsterdam - most of the Netherlands (the dry bits) is diked in (because they're lower than the wet bits). (d) If, after going from Melbourne to Wagga, you continue in a straight line, you end up in Bundaberg, which is worse than the outback (I know, I've been there). But where  is  the  Outback  anyway? The article is pretty vague (with the excuse that the term itself is vague - fair enough). And my atlas doesn't give me the location of the black stump. For example, would you say there is any outback at all in NSW?   Greetings from the Nether-nether-lands.Â :)  DirkvdM  11:01, 22 January 2006 (UTC)    (c) I did notice the smiley, but I was just having a bit of fun (did you notice my return smiley?) (d) I agree the article on the outback needs some work. But it's a bit like trying to define where is the ""heartland of America"", or ""back of Bourke"" - or indeed, the ""black stump"". There is no definite boundary. I would say that large parts of NSW are in the outback, but don't pin me down to any particular places. I really don't get what this straight line thing is about. I never said Melbourne was 1000 miles from the outback in a straight line that passes through Wagga, all I said is that it was 1000 miles from the outback. You first raised Wagga, not me. One final question - if you don't know where the outback begins and ends, then presumably you don't claim to have been there, so how do you know that Bundaberg is worse than the outback? What's your basis of comparison? And worse in what sense? Â :)Â :)Â :)  JackofOz  22:40, 22 January 2006 (UTC)    Quite simply nothing can be worse than Bundaberg. I might have said Los Angeles, but it seems LA has a nice bit along the coast. However, as in Bundy, I hightailed it out of there after just one night. Since Bundaberg feeds off destitute backpackers, sucking them dry with hard labour for a few pennies and I'm a backpacker, you can imagine I didn't quite like the place. I wasn't destitute, so I could escape, but the one night at the backpacker's was quite enough. When I told the guy at the desk it was the worst place I'd ever stayed, he said that I was the wort customer he'd ever had with such an uninterested face that it was obvious this was a standard answer and he was beyind caring.  DirkvdM  08:35, 23 January 2006 (UTC)    Good story. I hope you've recovered. Cheers  JackofOz  08:56, 24 January 2006 (UTC)                                   No-one said the chances of dying on your birthday were 365^2 (if we ignore leap years). Anon suggested as much but didn't say it. And StuRat said the chances of being born  and  dying on the same day are 365^2. However, in the phrase 'dying on your birthday', the birthday is already given. It's a matter of what info you already have. What are the chances that my brother was born on 1 March? To you that's 1/365. To me, however, it's 1, because I know my brother's birthday. And if you ask what the chances are that someone is born on their birthday, that birthday is already given (even when they're not born yet, because by saying 'birthday' you assume that to be given).   It's incredible how many people get this sort of wrong. And it cuts through national boundaries. But also through cultural boundaries? Are people bad at this by nature or is it a matter of upbringing? Are our educational systems so deficient? Do, say, Indians suffer from this too? Either way, something should be done about this. This specific example is pretty trivial, but people often make mistakes when it comes to making assessments of something. Which is probably at the heart of this. Details like leap years (in this example) matter to some extent, but assessing the magnitude of the outcome of a calculation is in real life waaay more important than getting it exactly right. Even in, say, rocket science. There, you need to get things exactly right, but you also need to have made an assessment first to detect a 'slight' error like getting the power of an equation wrong (which looks like a little number in the equation but can have dramatic consequences for the outcome). How can we improve our educational systems to avert this problem? This is really really important. I don't remember getting  any  education in this respect (I had to teach myself). Mathematics at school only deals with exact calculations, not the much more important issue of getting things roughly right in a quick assessment. Sorry about this rant, but, like I said, I consider this to be  really  important. How can democracy work properly if voters don't realise that, say, terrorism is a relative triviality in the grand scheme of things? (Then again, that is also a matter of geting fed the right basic data.)  DirkvdM  08:59, 21 January 2006 (UTC)   This just in. In the Netherlands last year there was the issue that pabo students (future teachers) are bad at calculating. In today's NRC (science section) there is an article that says the government concluded that mathematics should be obligatory for pabo students. However, when experts were asked, they said mathematics and ordinary calculating are two completely different things and wondered if those politicains knew what they were talking about (considering the fact that about 90% of them have studied law and economics and such that is a very legit question).  DirkvdM  12:49, 21 January 2006 (UTC)                   Agreed. In the US, they now seem to be teaching estimating as a way to check the rough magnitude of your answer. For example, if prices increase by 10% each year relative to the previous year, for 3 years straight, you would expect the increase to be somewhere near 30%. It's actually (1.1)^3 or 1.331 or 33.1%, but 30% at least gives you the rough answer.  StuRat  15:10, 21 January 2006 (UTC)               I can't determine from the above who said it, but it's certainly not 1/365^2. The probability someone died on their birthday is 1/365. The probability someone both was born and died  on a given date  is 1/365^2. Choose a date, choose a random person. The probability that person was born on that date is 1/365. Does everyone follow? Ok, now the probability that person also died on that date is 1/365, so the total probaility is 1/365^2. The probability someone died on their birthday is still 1/365, because the first step isn't there. The 'given date' is the person's birthday, so that probability is 1. If someone still doesn't believe this, it's the same thing as rolling a die. You have a 1/36 chance of rolling a given number (say, 4) twice in a row, but you have a 1/6 chance of rolling any number twice in a row, since only the second roll is important. -- BluePlatypus  21:55, 21 January 2006 (UTC)     It's astonishing that such a trivially simple question has given rise to such an amount of discussion. Suffice to say that, ignoring the slight complication of leap years, the latest post from BluePlatypus is spot on - anyone who doesn't have enough maths to see this really should shy away from this kind of question altogether. There is plenty of non-mathematical stuff on Wikipedia to keep everyone happy.  Maid Marion  16:35, 23 January 2006 (UTC)     Agreed.  StuRat  18:37, 25 January 2006 (UTC)           A related point is that assumptions should be explicitly stated, to aid in the assessment of whether they're true. Here, the common implicit assumption is that a person's chance of being born on any particular day is 1/365, and that a person's chance of dying on any particular day is also 1/365 (ignoring the complication for leap years). I don't think either assumption is so obviously true as to merit being passed over in silence. Climate-related patterns of sexual activity, as well as social factors such as school graduations, might well affect birth rates for each day. I also suspect that people might be more likely to die on their birthdays. Some might have celebrations causing excitement causing heart attack. Some might have been in bad health but hanging on, psychologically, to be able to mark one more birthday, but then let go. On the other hand, I wouldn't be astounded if people are happier on their birthdays and therefore less likely to die. I do agree that, if you make these simplifying assumptions, it's elementary probability to say that the chance is 1/365.

Yeltensic42.618   don't   panic  21:43, 21 January 2006 (UTC)    That seems to be your spin on Zeizmic's comment. But Zeizmic can speak for him/her-self.

How did I miss that?  Yeltensic42.618   don't   panic  02:16, 22 January 2006 (UTC)    The penny just dropped Zeizmic. Took me a while. The eye sees what it thinks is there. But what about the one above? You hadn't joined the discussion at that stage. Now I really am mystified.  JackofOz  04:41, 22 January 2006 (UTC)    I think the first one refers to the lack of a capital ""P"" in DirkvdM's comment. Thus playboy as a person being read as opposed to Playboy as a magazine.  CambridgeBayWeather   (Talk)  06:17, 22 January 2006 (UTC)                 Since I can't follow any of the above anymore let me point out the little bit of trivia that the Dutch word 'plee', which means 'toilet', is pronounced the same as 'play' in English, so 'playboy' sounds something like 'toiletguy'.  DirkvdM  11:10, 22 January 2006 (UTC)   Dirk's comment didn't sound to me like he meant a ""playboy"" as in a person, but he can speak for himself.

Most of the time the appearance is identical, dark blue links that are underlined. However, at work sometimes pages will show the links as light blue and not underlined. It does not happen at home and seems to be a random effect. Any ideas?  CambridgeBayWeather   (Talk)  07:10, 21 January 2006 (UTC)     This happens to me as well, but at school. The only thing i can think of is making sure the setting is on when you log on at work.-- Ali K  07:31, 21 January 2006 (UTC)    Which setting, because the browser and Wikipedia preferences are the same at both locations.  CambridgeBayWeather   (Talk)  08:07, 21 January 2006 (UTC)           My preferences are occasionally 'lost', even when I'm logged in. I solve this by logging out and then in again. But you say some links are light blue? Sounds like external links. Are the  same  links coloured differently depending on the machine you're working at?  DirkvdM  09:10, 21 January 2006 (UTC)    It's the internal links that turn light blue and loose the underlined feature. I don't have to log out to get back the normal setting. It will eventually return to normal.  CambridgeBayWeather   (Talk)  10:01, 21 January 2006 (UTC)    Pages sometimes look weird for me too, though I can't put my finger on exactly what's wrong.

I did not see any information on the significance of the symbols, if any, on David Friedland's puzzle ball logo. I know what the Omega symbols means. But what about the other symbols? Amber     A small  Omega  looks like a 'w', but the  cyrillic  letter below the 'W' is a short 'I', so I'm stuck too.  DirkvdM  19:55, 21 January 2006 (UTC)       I don't think there's any particular signficance. It's just letters from various scripts. The ones I recognize are Omega from Greek, ""W"" which you probably know already, the Cyrillic  Short I  (which DirkvdM apparently beat me to while I was submitting thisÂ :)), the Hebrew  Resh  and the  Katakana  ""fi"". I don't think it's supposed to spell anything out. -- BluePlatypus  20:06, 21 January 2006 (UTC)       It's the symbols on the Wiki news  logo you ought to be worried about  [49]  . That thing always creeps me out. -- Aaron  02:29, 22 January 2006 (UTC)           The symbols? Do you mean the map? (Looks a bit like a face.) Neat map, by the way. Does it give the landsizes in correct proportions? Is  Africa  really as big as  Asia ?  Geography of Asia  says the latter is 50 million km, against Africa's 30 million km. But it doesn't define the area and that is a bit vague in the case of Asia.  DirkvdM  11:25, 22 January 2006 (UTC)   Oh, my Philip's Atlas says the size of Asia is 44.500.000 km, but it doesn't say what constitutes Asia either.  DirkvdM  13:06, 22 January 2006 (UTC)                   Yeah, I meant the map. (I should have said ""symbolism"" instead of ""symbols"".) It looks like the logo that the  United Nations  would use if they ever acquired any actual power and nationalized all the news organizations in the world. In fact, it looks so similar to the  UN logo  that I'm surprised they haven't sent a cease-and-desist letter to the Wikimedia Foundation. -- Aaron  22:12, 22 January 2006 (UTC)                           Or we could join them a an NGO and make it legit (or doesn't it work that way?). By the way, in the case of the UN, that would be an internationalisation in stead of a nationalisation.  DirkvdM  08:46, 23 January 2006 (UTC)                       Actually, quick correction for BluePlatypus: the katakana is the little-used ""Wi"", suggesting that it is in fact an attempt to include the first character(s) of ""Wikipedia"" in a few languages.  Confusing Manifestation  15:15, 26 January 2006 (UTC)           [ edit ]   Zodiac   I was born in December, so I'm a Capricorn, but I was actually two months premature, so should I have a different sign?-- Givnan  17:01, 21 January 2006 (UTC)     Yes, one on your forehead to warn other people that you care about this sort of thing.Â :)  DirkvdM  19:57, 21 January 2006 (UTC)   Just ignore DirkvdM, he's being silly. Firstly, just being born in December doesn't make you a Capricorn. Capricorn starts when the Sun moves into that sign from Sagittarius, usually around 21-22 December. If you were born on either of those dates, you'd need to consult an ephemeris to find out the exact time the signs changed (it is almost never conveniently at midnight). Secondly, the natal chart is drawn as at the moment of birth. That you were born premature is irrelevant. You were born when you were born, not when the doctors thought you would be born.  JackofOz  20:28, 21 January 2006 (UTC)           What about caesarians? Doesn't matter? What influence does being surrounded by flesh have? If a child is going to be born into an unlucky sign, could the mother keep the newborn in a box made of meat for a month to simulate a later birth? Or does it have to be a womb? If so, why? -- BluePlatypus  00:35, 22 January 2006 (UTC)               See  Ephemeris  for more about ephemerides. (I love cool plurals!)  Keenan Pepper  20:47, 21 January 2006 (UTC)         BluePlatypus has a point there. I would have thought it would actually be the moment that you come into existence that determines what sign you are, and therefore the surrounding body would be irrelevant. As I was probably conceived sometime in May, I'd be something entirely different. -- Givnan  06:16, 22 January 2006 (UTC)     Now you're all just making it up as you go along. A box made of meat??? How revolting. And suggesting that conception time replace birth time, a basis that has been used for thousands of years, just because you think it feels better or whatever, is an absurd way to proceed. Do your research, study the subject, then make comments. Uneducated comments can sometimes be quite amusing, but on this occasion ....? Nah.  JackofOz  06:38, 22 January 2006 (UTC)           That's just ad hominem. How about actually providing an answer instead of being arrogant. Astrology is made up nonsense. The fact that it's old nonsense doesn't mean anything except that it's been discredited far longer. -- BluePlatypus  14:29, 22 January 2006 (UTC)                   And not only is it nonsense, it's dangerous nonsense. Do you think race should be a factor in job applications? No? Why not? Because science (that is, simple observation) tells us that skin color has absolutely nothing to do with your personality, competence and ability to do a job. Yet the theories of race holding that black people were inferior to whites is something that was held for centuries. And it would be just as wrong for an employer to reject an applicant because his birth-date suggests (via the discredited theories of Astrology) that the applicant would be unsuitable. If you believe astrology, do you think employers should use it when screening applicants? Do you feel the same way about using skin-color? And if you don't, for what reason apart from the fallacy of  Appeal to tradition  that is the  only  basis for both ideas? -- BluePlatypus  15:00, 22 January 2006 (UTC)                           I agree that astrology is utter nonsense, but that's still a POV that should ideally stay off the Reference Desk. Note that the original question was a  technical  question about astrology that could be answered using verifiable sources, without resorting to saying ""it doesn't matter because it's nonsense anyway"".  Keenan Pepper  17:33, 22 January 2006 (UTC)                                   No answer on astrology is complete without a warning that it is utter nonsense. That said, one's ascendant sign (and therefore presumably the sun sign as well) is nearly universally claimed by astrologers (today at least) to correctly be that which is on the horizon  at the precise moment of a person's first breath . So yes, one could plan a caesarean section to select one's descendant's ascendant, and I suspect that some have so done. -  Nunh-huh  21:31, 22 January 2006 (UTC)                     Blue Platypus, I provided an answer to the original question based on my years of study of the subject (decades actually). You posed a question about caesarians, which I would have happily answered had you not gone off on a weird tangent about boxes made of meat. Then Givnan started talking about the way he/she thinks astrology should be practised, totally ignoring the long tradition of the way it actually is practised. Thats like a person who has never studied a word of Greek, suggesting that Greeks use the Latin alphabet to write their language, because they think it would work better. Thats why I made my comment about uneducated opinions. Im sorry if you thought I was being arrogant  I was merely frustrated.   But now, you demand answers, while in the same breath taking the view that the whole subject is made up nonsense. Why would anybody bother to provide answers to an obviously closed mind? So you can perhaps understand my scepticism that youre actually expecting a serious response. But what the hell, Im game. I said in my original response: You were born when you were born, not when the doctors thought you would be born. That principle can be extended to caesareans: You were born when you were born, not when you might have been born had nature been allowed to take its course. As Nunh-huh says, its all based on when the child takes their first breath. The circumstances leading up to the birth dont come into it.   After years of serious consideration, I am still open-minded about whether astrology is worthy of serious consideration. Its funny how those who decry it as utter nonsense, made up nonsense or dangerous nonsense dont appear to have ever given it any serious consideration at all. Without proper investigation, how would they know?   Your example about an employer rejecting an applicant purely on their birth date has nothing to do with astrology. If you want to discredit astrology, be my guest. But please do it on the basis of what astrologers claim for astrology, not on superstition or newspaper columns. Popular newspaper astrology has about as much connection with proper astrology as the Ku Klux Klan has to do with human rights.  JackofOz  23:39, 22 January 2006 (UTC)     Since astrology never bothers to provide any mechanism whereby people get their personalities and fate from their birth date, it would be impossible to say how the birth date should be determined in unusual cases. I consider myself one of the many who considers all horoscopes to be total BS, BTW.  StuRat  23:52, 22 January 2006 (UTC)           Here we go again. What is it about astrology that induces people to proudly proclaim their closed-mindedness about it, and yet still feel qualified to offer opinions about it? There is no such thing as an  Ultimate Book of Holy Writ  that tells you what science has to say on any particular subject. There are millions of sources of scientific information, and many of them say conflicting things. Ultimately it's down to what the individual believes to be the truth. Or, they go to an  expert  on the subject, a scientist. Same with astrology. There are millions of books on the subject - so please substantiate this claim that ""astrology never bothers to provide any mechanism whereby ..."".  JackofOz  00:14, 23 January 2006 (UTC)                   You have no understanding of the scientific method, which likely explains why you believe in astrology. Well established science (stuff that's been around for many years) doesn't come down to personal beleifs or trusting an expert, but to overwhelming proof. For example, the fact that the Earth orbits the Sun is not ""a matter of opinion"", but quite firmly established via numerous astronomical observations over centuries. A new scientific theory may very well have supporters and detractors, but will be either accepted or rejected after a few years of observation and experimentation to either prove or disprove the theory. Astrology, on the other hand, has been around for thousands of years and has yet to prove it's case. Where it makes vague generalities about personality, testing is impossible (by design), and where it predicts specifics, like date of death, it hasn't been shown to be any more accurate than a life insurance agent's mortality tables. After so long without proof, any theory in science would be tossed onto the trash heap, as should happen with astrology.  StuRat  12:19, 24 January 2006 (UTC)                       Also, if you claim that astrology does provide some mechanism whereby the position of the stars (which is really due to the orientation of the Earth) is supposed to effect people, based on their date of birth, let's see it.  StuRat  12:25, 24 January 2006 (UTC)             That's all a bit full-on, StuRat.     I have no understanding of the scientific method, eh? Hmmm ... interesting how you could come to that conclusion from what I've said so far.       ""Which likely explains why you believe in astrology""  - Huh?? What I said was:  ""After years of serious consideration, I am still open-minded about whether astrology is worthy of serious consideration.""  If you think that amounts to a confession of belief in astrology, I have to seriously question your knowledge of the English language. But yes, I have studied it, for 30 years. I think a discipline that has been around for 5,000 years in many different cultures is worthy of some serious scholarly attention.       Now we come to the juicy bit. What on Earth (forgive the pun) is this stuff about  ""if you claim that astrology does provide some mechanism whereby the position of the stars (which is really due to the orientation of the Earth) is supposed to effect [sic] people, based on their date of birth"" ? Where did you get that from? No, really, where? Those are entirely your words, mate, not mine. I have made no claims for astrology whatsoever, so there is nothing that I have to prove.       The only person who has made a claim that requires proof is your good self, StuRat. You said that  ""astrology never bothers to provide any mechanism whereby people get their personalities and fate from their birth date"" . I asked you previously to justify that statement, and I'm still waiting.       What interests me is that people such as yourself tend to get very defensive about astrology. If it really is the hogwash you claim it is - and I'm not necessarily disputing that - why do you lose any energy bothering to even discuss it all? It's not as if science has anything to feel threatened about ... is it? What ever happened to the spirit of open-minded enquiry? Just damning a set of beliefs or claims out of hand, when you have never even scratched the surface of them, is hardly a scientific approach, is it? Cheers, mate  JackofOz  13:48, 24 January 2006 (UTC)     I find it a fascinating concept worthy of scholarly attention that people actually give serious consideration to astrology. It deserves it about as much as my theory that the Earth is held up by a giant aardvark with Jon Stewart's head, driving through the heavens in a chariot pulled by gerbils.  Yeltensic42.618   don't   panic  17:09, 24 January 2006 (UTC)   BTW, no idea is valid just for having been around for 5,000 years. Racism, for instance, has been around for millennia in a great variety of cultures.  Yeltensic42.618   don't   panic  17:09, 24 January 2006 (UTC)     Yes, that's right. But who here has said that astrology is valid? Certainly not me. I have explained twice now that I am not making any such claims. But just being a practice that is illegal, immoral or possibly scientifically worthless does not mean it should not be studied. You mention racism. How much literature is there on racism - a huge amount. Criminologists spend their lives studying murder and other illegal practices.  James Randi  has made it his life's work to debunk paranormal etc claims - but despite his utter scepticism, you can bet he has studied ALL the serious literature on these subjects. Until it was finally proven that there is no such thing as perpetual motion, the impossibility of trisecting an angle, or the irrationality of  (pi), inventors and mathematicians spent their lives studying these things in an effort to get to the truth. Astrology is no less worthy of study - I did not say belief - than racism; ESP; murder; the 67 scientifically unexplained ""miraculous"" healings from the grotto at Lourdes; or why people who uphold the scientific method routinely consign astrology to the dustbin without ever having even tried to study it in depth in an effort to understand why it has been so pervasive in human society since Adam. Way back on 22 January, I said ""Do your research, study the subject, then make comments."" I stand by that.  JackofOz  21:01, 24 January 2006 (UTC)    Studying astrology in the way you've described (the bit about literature on racism, murder and paranormal claims) is quite different from, as you have upheld, considering it a serious possibility. You can  study  a subject without that (eg criminologist who study murder generally don't consider committing it).  Yeltensic42.618   don't   panic  14:38, 25 January 2006 (UTC)                   I think you're putting words into my mouth, Yeltensic. Seems to be the flavour of the month at the moment - yum, those words taste really great, you should try them - sorry, but people insist on telling me what I said while using words I never used. I have never said that I ""consider it a serious possibility"". I have said, over and over, ""I am still open-minded about whether astrology is worthy of serious consideration"". It sounds to me like you and others have decided up front that astrology must be bunkum and therefore it is bunkum, and therefore one would be wrong to spend any time at all in researching it, and therefore anyone who does bother to scratch beneath the surface is to be regarded with suspicion. Yes, criminologists study murder without ever getting tempted to practise it. And your analogy is ...Â ? Where have I ever advocated that people should practise astrology? Nowhere and never. I have studied it as a private interest, but this debate is probably the most I've ever written about it. And the debate is not even about astrology any more, it's about the psychology of science and the attitude of certain people who uphold the principle of open-minded objective enquiry (which is what the scientific method is all about), but seem to be selective about where they apply that principle. When it comes to some subjects, their attitudes are subjective their minds are closed. Why, I really don't know. Maybe they can speak for themselves. I've heard plenty of criticism of me for daring to suggest that astrology is something that might legitimately be studied, but absolutely nothing about why it shouldn't.  JackofOz  00:01, 26 January 2006 (UTC)                           Sorry, there must have been a misunderstanding. When you said, ""worthy of serious consideration"", I (and most likely the others on this thread) thought you meant serious consideration in the sense of ""seriously considering that it might be true"". Now I see what you meant, but you might want to consider your wording more.  Yeltensic42.618   don't   panic  00:19, 26 January 2006 (UTC)                                   Right, let me get this clear. It's possible to have an open-minded, objective study of something even though you've already dismissed the possibility that it could be true? Is that what you're saying?  Of course  I have entertained the possibility that it  might  be true. If I had already decided that was not the case, why on earth would I have spent any time studying it at all? I'm not an adherent of the Sir Humphrey Appleby school of investigation, where one never conducts an enquiry unless one is certain of the outcome beforehand. It's not my wording that needs changing.  JackofOz  11:50, 26 January 2006 (UTC)                     (I've reformated the following a bit for ease of comprehension. Hope nobody objects.)   Let me give my opinion as to why astrology isn't worthy of a major scientific study:     Since no mechanism is given for describing how birth date would affect personality or fate, this mechanism can't be studied. (Again, if you claim the mechanism is given, let's hear it.)    You talk here and earlier about the ""birth date"" being the determining factor of fate and personality. Theres a lot more to it than that. Using birth date alone is what  numerology  does, and what  popular newspaper astrology  does  which as I explained earlier on has nothing to do with true astrology (remember the KKK analogy?). Newspaper astrology only considers the position of the Sun, which in most cases you can get from the birth date alone. But on days when the Sun changes signs, this is likely to give an inaccurate result. The transition from one sign to the next almost never happens conveniently at midnight. A lot of people go through life believing they were born when the Sun was in, say, Cancer, when in fact they were born in Leo or Gemini. The same for all the other Sun-signs. This is somewhat fudged by the notion of cusps  opinions vary greatly about whether to pay these a lot of attention, or little, or none. But leaving all that aside, its absurd to suggest that 1/12 of the population of the Earth will all have the same fate (whether its today, or the coming week, or the coming year) just because they all share the same sign. That is what popular newspaper astrology would have us believe, and youd be right to give it a wide berth. I have just as much scepticism of a lot of Chinese astrology, where everybody born in the same  year  has the same sign. Even more unbelievable. (But interesting that most people, scientists included, can readily tell you their Sun sign and probably their Chinese sign too, even if they claim they have no belief in astrology. Wonder why that is.)   A proper birth chart is drawn as at the moment of birth, and takes into account the birth location, and the exact positions of the Sun, the Moon, all the planets, and some other features such as the Moons node, at the moment of birth. It also takes into account the positions of the houses, which cycle through all 12 signs every day. And it takes into account the aspects (angular distance) between all these things, and pays particular attention to certain kinds of harmonics. This makes an individuals birth chart (almost) unique. But hold on, what about 2 or more babies born on the same day, at the same time, in the same city? Happens all the time. Does this mean they will all have identical lives and personalities. Of course not. Which is why any astrologer worth their salt would never get into predicting fate. So much depends on  environment and circumstance . So this in another misconception about astrology does. Astrology  per se  will give an insight into possibilities, and broad (usually very broad) personality types. This is based on the as above, so below metaphysical principle. But people are usually more interested in knowing something more specific and juicy than that, so professional astrologers tend to garnish their interpretations (often using complementary skills) in order to get repeat business. A lot of what most (not all) astrologers will tell you can be dismissed as pap to make you feel good since youve just handed over a wad of money. But that does not in itself invalidate everything about astrology.   As to specifics about the mechanisms of birth chart drawing and an introduction to interpretation, I can thoroughly recommend  ""The Round Art""  by A T Mann, a really beautifully illustrated and presented book that gives a lot of historical background to astrology, and the information is presented in a way that I think would appeal to most Wikipedians. He also wrote  ""The Divine Plot: Astrology, Reincarnation, Cosmology and History"" . This is a tougher nut to crack, but still well worth reading if youre serious about educating yourself about this arcane study, whether you believe anything about it or not.       There are many different versions of astrology, so which one to study would be a problem. In Chinese astrology, for example, the birth year is more important than the birth month and day.    That there are many different versions of astrology just means there are many different things that need studying. Its not a reason to study none of them. Seekers of knowledge don't get to be picky like that, Im afraid.       There are other unproven theories which should be tested, however. Here is one: ""Trans-fatty acids cause acne. The mechanism is that these solid fats 'melt' at body temp, are digested with the aid of bile in the ileum and cesium portions of the small intestine, are absorbed by the intestinal wall, then pass into the blood stream, where they proceed to the sebaceous pores. Once excreted by the pores, these trans-fatty acids cool enough to re-harden, thus blocking the pores and causing pimples."" Now, this theory may or not may be correct, but at least there is a mechanism described which could be studied. It is also quite specific, and not at all vague. A general and vague statement, similar to astrology, would be ""food causes acne and we don't know how"". Such a statement could not, and should not, be studied.  StuRat  00:40, 26 January 2006 (UTC)    Dont really know what to make of that. Who can say what should not be studied? Sounds a bit redolent of Nazi book-burning. I think Ill just leave it.  JackofOz  14:19, 26 January 2006 (UTC)             Basically, the problem with scientifically studying astrology is that it's more akin to religion to science. That doesn't mean it isn't worthy of study, but it does mean it can't be studied the way you would study an unproven scientific theory.  Yeltensic42.618   don't   panic  01:29, 26 January 2006 (UTC)    Spot on. Astrology uses scientific methods to determine planetary positions to draw a chart. But the interpretation of that chart is very much an art, not a science. Twenty different astrologers will give you twenty different interpretations of the same chart  there will be some overlaps, but they will each bring their own history to it as well. It simply cant be treated like some mathematical formula where you feed in data on the left hand side and the answer comes out on the right hand side. Its just not like that, and the trap a lot of scientists fall into is assuming it is like that and then damning it for not behaving the way they expect it to, ie. being able to come up with verifiable and reproducible results. (But that is also true of many other scientific things, such as medicine. How many different diagnoses can be made from the one set of presenting symptoms? In general, many. It comes down to the skill of the doctor, but its pot luck as to whether or not you find the right one. And true of psychologists, psychiatrists, and others.) Astrology is one subject where a truly open mind and no preconceptions whatsoever are absolutely essential if you really want to get inside it. And it would help greatly by not assuming it has to meet the standards that science imposes on it. Its like ESP in that regard, I guess. If that makes it outside the realm of what science can deal with, I guess that science's loss. But individual scientists can choose to overcome that and do some reading in their spare time, can't they. I cannot explain it any better than this right now. You must do some of the work yourself, and read ""The Round Art"" or any other reputable and scholarly book on the subject. The WP article on  astrology  is full of useful information and links to get you started as well.  JackofOz  14:19, 26 January 2006 (UTC)    No, it isn't science's loss. There's nothing stopping individual scientists from reading about it in their spare time, but it would be a mockery of science for them to dabble in astrology as they would with physcis, chemistry etc. No different than scientists trying to prove religious claims. But scientists (and pretty much anyone with a scientific, rather than religious, worldview) generally apply scientific standards to anything, because it is verifiable. You seem to disagree, but as far as we're concerned, for something to be worthy of serious consideration (as being true, that is, I'm not talking about just reading about it in your spare time), it has to ""behave the way they expect it to"". That's why religion and astrology get thrown out the window.  Yeltensic42.618   don't   panic  16:33, 26 January 2006 (UTC)    Well, where does that leave the thousands of scientists all over the world who have strong religious faith and are devout practising Christians, Jews, Buddhists, Muslims, Hindus or whatever? Are they all making a mockery of science by daring to ""dabble"" in religion? That suggestion would be grossly offensive to most of them, I would think. I know of scientists who see no conflict in being both a scientist and a person with religious beliefs, in things that science does not and probably never will have answers for. Clearly many others must have grappled with this issue, but they appear to have found an accommodation. Are you speaking for them?  JackofOz  16:51, 26 January 2006 (UTC)    There's nothing stopping them from having religious beliefs, what I mean is that they just can't try to scientifially prove them. It isn't necessarily a mockery of science for them to  have  religious beliefs, it just would be for them to try to  prove  them. That said, I do think that many (or even most, if not all) religious beliefs can't be reconciled with science very well, but it shouldn't be too hard for them to avoid the problem, they would just have to ignore their beliefs temporarily.  Yeltensic42.618   don't   panic  20:18, 26 January 2006 (UTC)   BTW, one problem with religion is that it largely depends on gaps in science. This means that it can provide answers for questions that science hasn't answered, but science has a tendency to fill gaps over time, leaving religion in a difficult spot. This has already come up on a number of matters, such as the Earth being the center of the universe, etc. Whenever this happens, religion can only be defended by covering one's ears and chanting ""La la la la I'm not listening."" So it's probably only a matter of time before religion is left without any gaps to fill.  Yeltensic42.618   don't   panic  20:18, 26 January 2006 (UTC)    Well, I think we're getting quite distant from the original subject now, so I'm going to withdraw from this discussion after this. I'm not here to defend religion, just as I was never here to defend astrology. They both have much more eloquent spokespersons than I, and I have many other battles to fight.   I would just say in parting that you're on very, very thin ice philosophically in talking about what scientists ""should"" study. Your example about the Earth not being the centre of the Solar System (I think you meant that) is a case in point. Since it was considered a religious question, scientists should never have dabbled in it at all, according to you. Why weren't they making a mockery of science by setting out to prove or disprove this?   It's just not possible to make a black and white distinction between science and religion. Is there a scientist who has never asked: ""What was there before the Big Bang? What made it happen in the first place? Where did all that energy and matter come from?"" Hardly. BTW, I just don't believe those who claim to be able to comprehend concepts like, ""It was always just there"". My regard for the capacity of the human mind does not go that far. Will science ever answer these questions? Impossible to know, but in my opinion, no. Does that mean that science should become disinterested in these questions? Again, no.   In relation to things behaving the way they are expected, there have been many examples of natural phenomena that were completely unexpected. Remember the amazement of the scientific community when the rings of Saturn were found to be ""braided""? No scientist had anticipated or predicted that. Does that mean the observation should have been ignored, or put down to an optical illusion? Of course not.   You might choose to ""throw religion out the window"", but one day you may regret taking that approach. God bless (oops).

TERdON  23:28, 21 January 2006 (UTC)       [ edit ]   Quiz   I am completing a quiz with my 9 yr old son and we are stuck on a couple of questions they areÂ :-     what country accounts for 35% of the worlds cities with more than on million inhabitants?       What unusual charecter name and part of a 1990's us well known sitcom means ""the ultimate truth in all things "" in Hindi     For the first one try  Thirty most populous cities in the world . The external link leads to a list of 32.  CambridgeBayWeather   (Talk)  21:09, 21 January 2006 (UTC)     But that lists only a few dozen. My Philip's Atlas (from 1998) gives the following numbers of cities with more than one million inhabitants (for countries with 10 or more): US 38, China 34, India 22, Russia 13, Brazil 12, Japan 10. Out of a total of 284, so even the US has only about 15%. However, this also depends on how you define 'city'. This listing is for the total metropolitan area (such as 'greater Paris'). Even Amsterdam and Rooterdam ar listed, even though Amsterdam officially has only about 850.000. Also, over the last few years, most cities will have grown, and judging by the 'runners up', the top 3 will now probably be China, US, India, because for the US it drops straight to 665.000 (Jacksonville), whereas China and India have 8 over 800.000, and those may exceed a million by now.   For some more stats, as far as cities over 10 million are concerned, there are 15, of which 3 in China and 2 in India and the US each. And none in the UK. London once was the biggest, but now that is Tokyo-Yokohama, with a staggering 26 million! Next biggest at around 16 million are Sao Paulo, Shanghai, Bombay, Mexico City and New York City. After that numbers drop off quite fast. Most have 'just' 1 or 2 million. There are only 41 cities with more than 4 million inhabitants, with India and the US each having 6. What also strikes me is that there aren't too many African cities on the list. And Iran has 5 over 1 million, with Teheran having almost 7 million.   In short, the assumption in the question is wrong, unless they define 'city' differently.  DirkvdM  13:49, 22 January 2006 (UTC)           Africa is quite sparsely populated, so I won't be too surprised with that.  deeptrivia  ( talk ) 04:47, 23 January 2006 (UTC)                   I once heard that in Africa most people live in the capital (so just one city per country), in which case you'd expect at least one city with over 1 million inhabitants per country. Actually, there are 22 cities over 1 million in Africa, 5 of with in South Africa. So for 61 countries, that means about one in three countries have a 'million-city'. So it's not as bad as I suggested. But for most countries there is indeed just one city on the list. Which is probably why I overlooked them.  DirkvdM  08:55, 23 January 2006 (UTC)                 For the second one,  Dharma  should help.  GeeJo   (t)   (c)    Â  21:15, 21 January 2006 (UTC)           I thought too that the quizmaster must have intended Dharma, though actually it doesn't remotely mean ""the ultimate truth in all things."" The answer to the first question is hidden  here .  deeptrivia  ( talk ) 21:20, 21 January 2006 (UTC)           Pity that ""Ken"" isn't an unusual name, or that might be it... As for Dharma, I found a Buddhist website which stated  In the face of the profusion of ideas and practices which were later developments, it is useful for us to return to the positive and timeless Dhamma taught by the Buddha. Whatever people believe and practise in the name of Buddhism the basic Teachings of the Buddha still exist in the original Buddhist texts.  ( [50] ).  Grutness ... wha?  01:48, 22 January 2006 (UTC)       The word  Dharma  essentially remains untranslatable in the English language. Perhaps the ""ultimate truth"" definition is inspired by the following verse:       "" Verily, that which is Dharma is truth.   Therefore they say of a man who speaks truth, 'He speaks the Dharma,'   or of a man who speaks the Dharma, 'He speaks the Truth.'   Verily, both these things are the same.""   (Brh.  Upanishad , 1.4.14)     deeptrivia  ( talk ) 02:14, 22 January 2006 (UTC)   It's true that Dharma cannot be translated into English, but Ancient Chinese and Early Japanese texts use the word  (Chinese 'fa', Japanese 'hou'), meaning 'Law' (like we say the 'laws of physics', for example), but as this does really explain it properly, any Japanese texts now use the word  (daruma), which is closer to the original pronunciation. The characters actually mean something like 'infinite patience', and are an example of an 'ateji', or characters used to fit the pronunciation of another word. Usually the characters are also intended to convey a related meaning. -- Givnan  06:31, 22 January 2006 (UTC)   By the way, the Web says there was a sitcom in the US in the 1990s called 'Dharma and Greg' -- Givnan  08:38, 22 January 2006 (UTC)     Indeed,  Dharma and Greg  was the reason I mentioned the nameÂ :)  GeeJo   (t)   (c)    Â  17:43, 22 January 2006 (UTC)       [ edit ]   Intelligence agencies   How many intelligence agencies are in the world?     I'd say about the same as the number of nations. But it depends on what you mean by ""intelligence agency"", since there's domestic and foreign intelligence. Most countries have some form of domestic intelligence going on, even if it's only a small branch of the police force. If you mean ""How many countries have foreign intelligence?"", it depends on what you mean by ""foreign intelligence"". Some countries just sit passively around listening to whatever radio signals they can interpret, others are active with spies and informants in foreign countries. It's not really possible to say how many, since having operatives in foreign countries isn't something governments like to talk about publicly. -- BluePlatypus  22:06, 21 January 2006 (UTC)           And of course there's military intelligence (the old oxymoron) as well. But there are certainly less nations with military intelligence than with civilian domestic intelligence. Also, there's any number of private firms like  Jane's , and companies selling satellite imagery who are in the intelligence business even if they don't qualifiy as government agencies. -- BluePlatypus  22:15, 21 January 2006 (UTC)           See  List of intelligence agencies   GeeJo   (t)   (c)    Â  22:11, 21 January 2006 (UTC)       [ edit ]   last quiz question   up to 1992 how many expressways did china have?   Very few. Maybe a few 10s of kilometers. They made most of them in the last decade. (Sorry, I know this won't exactly help your quiz question. )  deeptrivia  ( talk ) 01:10, 22 January 2006 (UTC)     Of course, that depends on how you define  expressway  (yes, it's me again). And what constitutes one expressway. Naturally, in China they're pretty long. At 2000 km, the Jingzhu Expressway might be longer than all the expressways in the Netherlands combined.  Expressways of China  doesn't seem to say how many there are.  DirkvdM  14:01, 22 January 2006 (UTC)           Really? I thought the Netherlands was full of autosnelwegen. Dunno how many of them are expressways though.  deeptrivia  ( talk ) 15:42, 22 January 2006 (UTC)                   Yeah, I suppose I exaggerated a bit. Not  too  much, though. The Neterlands is about 200 x 200 km if you'd compress it into a square. So 2000 km could then be a grid with about 30 km between the highways. In the central western region ( Randstad ) that would be a lot denser, but in the less populated regions it's less, so I suppose it's not too far off.  DirkvdM  22:24, 22 January 2006 (UTC)               By the way, only now do I notice that the question stipulates 'before 1992'. Why is that?

Something I've always wondered about came up during the match. On 3 occasions, Baghdatis was at ""match point"". The second and third time, the commentators called this ""two match points"" and ""three match points"" respectively. They're supposed to be describing what's happening right now, not keeping a running tally of how many match points there have been over the course of the match. But if they must refer to that, why don't they call it ""second match point"" and ""third match point""? Can anyone enlighten me? The  tennis  articles don't help.  JackofOz  06:14, 22 January 2006 (UTC)     They might also be referring to the  number  of match points (chances to win the match by winning a single point) a particular player is guaranteed to have in a particular match situation. For instance, if a player is serving in men's singles at the Open, with the score in the current game at 40-0, 5-4 up in the current set, and, say, 2 sets to 0 ahead, if they win any of the next 3 points they will win the match; if their opponent wins all three the game score will be ""deuce"", at which point the server can no longer win the match with a single point and it is no longer ""match point"". So, therefore, player at 40-0 up and the game score as described has 3 match points. A player can theoretically hold up to 6 match points (if they lead 6-0 in a tiebreaker). -- Robert Merkel  08:02, 22 January 2006 (UTC)       That makes a lot of sense, Robert. Thanks. Except I don't think that fits what I saw today, or previously. Maybe I should concentrate harder next time and work out what's really going on. That's if I can drag myself away from Wikipedia - easier said than done.  JackofOz  08:15, 22 January 2006 (UTC)           I was watching the match, probably with the same commentators, and  Robert Merkel  has perfectly described the usage of ""### match points"" that the commentators were using.-- Commander Keane  20:48, 22 January 2006 (UTC)         Robert is certainly correct. A player at 40 - 0 has three (consecutive) chances to clinch the set. Even if he misses the first chance, and the score moves to 40 - 15, he still has two (consecutive) chances, ie two set points/match points etc. Similarly, a player enjoying a lead of 40 - 0 during his opponent's service game is said to have 3 break points, ie 3 consecutive chances to break service. The phrase has nothing at all to do with how many such points have arisen over the course of the match.  Maid Marion  16:25, 23 January 2006 (UTC)     Thanks folks. Seems I've had the wrong idea for a long time. Next time I watch a match I'll take particular note of what the commentators say.

Seemed to work well.   ieff    08:44, 23 January 2006 (UTC)           I'm assuming the epoxy cures to a hard, smooth surface (if not disregard this comment). To get paint to stick to any surface, it needs to be rough; try using some fine grit sandpaper (the higher the number, the finer the grit; use something higher than 100). I would also reccomend using a primer before painting (primers bond to materials that paint won't and create a surface for the paint to stick to). If you use a primer, remember to lighly sand before painting (lightly sand between every step).

Tell her how crazy she sounds, saying a dog was faking illness, and that she's putting a lot of stress on everyone. Ask her to just calm down and suggest psychotherapy (though many people will take this as an insult). You might want to record a conversation you had with her to illustrate how irritating and strange she can seem. Try not to hate her, though: establish motivation. Why is she acting this way? Emotional problems? Is she trying to avoid dealing with her feelings about the death of your dog? (k-Parry)         Judging from your writing I would say you are a kid. Kids are notorious for misinterpretting the actions and feelings of their parents as hostility toward them. You say she never cared about the dog. If this was true, she wouldn't be crying after it died. I suspect she cares about the rest of you, too, and you just can't see it.  StuRat  22:00, 22 January 2006 (UTC)     That wouldn't explain her comments about the dog faking illness, or her dumb superstitions that ruin things for others. There really isn't room there for misinterpretation on the asker's part.  Yeltensic42.618   don't   panic  22:52, 22 January 2006 (UTC)           It's a combo of both. She misinterpretted her mother hating the dog but not her mother thinking it was faking or being superstitious.  StuRat  00:04, 23 January 2006 (UTC)         You know, if your mother is acting that way then she probably (for some reason) was not ever entirely able to move past herself. It's understandable that you see yourself as a victim, and you're right, but it's quite possible that she's a victim too (of what? that's probably not the most important thing at this point) and is projecting this on others.   I'm not a psychoanalyst, and I don't know all about the situation, but I think it's usually a good policy to try to take a step back from these situations and find some room to have compassion for everyone involved.

Also, some consider Baltimore a Northern city but Maryland a Southern state. For the most part, the climate is more akin to the South, and ditto for the terrain (no glacier-carved features), though a bay such as Chesapeake Bay is probably a more northern feature for the coastline. It is part of the Eastern Seaboard urban belt, which is mostly in the Northeast; it is mostly a politically left-leaning state; and the accent is generally considered Northern (or at least in Baltimore, perhaps the accent in other areas is Southern); however, in addition the climate and terrain already mentioned, it was a slave state before and during the Civil War, which would historically put it more in the South.

It was a foreign cartoon about a bear who might have been an orphan. Apparently the general format was that he'd make friends with other creatures, and have very simple adventures with them. It was shown for a while during the late 70's/early 80's in a lunchtime slot in rotation with other shows like The Clangers, Trumpton, Mr Benn, so it sounds like it was for a very young audience. Also, apparently it had a very nice theme song.   I don't remember it at all, but I've had a look through a bunch of 70's & 80's kids TV sites, and can't find anything fitting that description, so I'm thinking it might be fairly obscure, particularly if it was an imported show.

Rmhermen  13:58, 23 January 2006 (UTC)       In the old Scandinavian form, a farm name would come first though, then the name of the ""sogn"" (Denmark) or ""socken"" (Sweden) and then the ""Herred""/""Hrad"". The name ""Remmen"" is fairly generic though (it means ""belt"", ""the belt"" or ""belts"" in Dutch/German/Swedish/Danish/Norwegian), so there may be places by that name in all five countries. Certainly there are multiple in Scandinavia, so you won't get anywhere with that alone. I can see why you're having problems with ""Berkole"".

Does it mean that it is faster? or that it's graphics are better?  daniel  16:25, 23 January 2006 (UTC)     Generally people who make statements like that are  fanboys , either claiming ""The PS3 is gonna be the BEST THING EVER!"" or ""The PS3 is gonna SUCK"". While comparisons can be made between certain aspects of it's architecture and components as compared to other games consoles, computers, etc, for the most part it's all meaningless speculation. What actually matters is how it performs when it's released. Until then, it's all just ""My dad could beat up your dad"" posturing. -- Noodhoog  17:03, 23 January 2006 (UTC)     thanks.... daniel  18:05, 23 January 2006 (UTC)     For further information, you might want to have a look at  Cell (microprocessor) , though much of it probably won't make sense unless you're a computer programmer. Basically, the PS3's processor has many parallel ""work units"" to which you can assign different tasks to run in parallel. If all of them are used to their maximum efficiency, the total amount of work that can get done far exceeds that on a standard PC. The type of tasks required to support a computer game are well-suited to this kind of parallel processing. In practice, much of the grunt work that the Cell is optimized for is performed by the graphics card on a gaming PC anyway, and so the supposed speed advantage of the PS3 will not result in nearly as dramatic improvement in graphics as you might think. Additionally, PC's are a moving target. -- Robert Merkel  02:21, 24 January 2006 (UTC)       [ edit ]   Food   What dose it mean when I no longer crave food?

You just need to be sure to eat the proper amount instead of relying on your appetite to tell you what the proper amount is.

Of course I could be the odd one out, but I've heard so much utter crap about smoking that I'll assume this is also complete nonsense.

How can you get 12 people to unanamously to agree to acquit or convict someone consistantly?     Because, much of the time, cases are far less ambiguous than the ones that you hear about in the news and especially in tv shows. In practice, more often than not, cases in the United States are resolved by  plea bargain  and thus a jury never has to make a decision. Of the cases that actually go to trial, a large majority result in a conviction. Actual jury acquittals are quite rare, as  this graph  indicates (it's only for San Diego, but it's indicative). Prosecutors don't tend to take a course to trial unless they think they've got very strong evidence. -- Robert Merkel  06:21, 24 January 2006 (UTC)       In Canada, trials go to jury (as opposed to just a judge), when the accused is technically guilty (as viewed by a judge), but where they hope to get sympathy from a jury for a special case. This was the case when I was on jury duty once -- the lady got off. -- Zeizmic  13:19, 24 January 2006 (UTC)       Juries also get to discuss the case after the evidence is presented. That's what they are doing while they are 'out'. So if ten people think the defendant is guilty they get the chance to persuade the other two to agree. Actually they get potentially a long time to do that persuasion. If they really can't agree a jury can also (in most jurisdictions) return a 'majority verdict' in which only most of the twelve have to agree.  DJ Clayworth  16:26, 24 January 2006 (UTC)    In the US, a finding of criminal guilt by a jury has to be unanimous.-- Pharos  15:36, 25 January 2006 (UTC)    Noooo, that varies by state.

Macy, Wrecked 1915   A ship named the William H. Macy sunk off of the coast of North Carolina in 1915. This seems too much of a coincidence, not to be related somehow to the eponymous actor. Any insight?   My email is slittle@talos.com (though I know you specifically told me not to bother providing my own contact information.)   Cheers.   Scott Little     Actually, the actor William H Macy is not eponymous - unless there's something been named after him I'm not aware of. The above ship was certainly not named after him.  JackofOz  07:29, 24 January 2006 (UTC)           Indeed not, as  William H. Macy  was born in 1950. This raises the question after whom the ship was named.  Lupo  07:50, 24 January 2006 (UTC)                   Lacking a time machine, the ship can't have been named after him, but the possibility remains that he was named after the ship. Since that is his birth name, only his first and middle names would have been chosen, so perhaps his parents named him ""William H."" in honor of the ship. Then again, ""William H."" is a fairly common combo.  StuRat  11:02, 24 January 2006 (UTC)                           I did a bit of research, and you're right about the contemporary use of the word ""eponymous"". Originally, it referred to the person after whom something is named, but not to the thing itself. But now it has become used for both. Webster's 3rd has recognised this usage since 1986. The Oxford Dictionary was still holding out in 1989, but it made it into the 1998 New Oxford. I think it's unlikely that the actor was named after the ship, but if that were to be the case, both he and the ship would be called ""eponymous"" these days.

I wonder if the belief in gods has risen or declined over time. I mean, in terms of thousands of years. And when was genesis written anyway? I believe that if you add up everything in the bible then creation is supposed to have happened some 7000 years ago. But then again, according to the bible, the early people lived close to 1000 years, so I wonder how that can be then. Then again, there's more nonsense in Genesis, like where did the third generation come from? Incest? No, it turns out that Kain left and met another people. Another people? By a different god or something? I suppose the old testament is really a story about the origin of the Jews, not mankind as a whole.  DirkvdM  20:50, 24 January 2006 (UTC)                                   I believe only one group of people was said to have lived to those lengths of time. One explanation is that they measured age in months instead of years, as hunter-gatherers in general and Native Americans, in particular, tended to do. For such people the cycle of the moon is most important, since it dictates when the full moon will make night hunting possible. It also corresponds roughly with a woman's period, which brings up the idea that women may have originally had their periods on the full moon, when the men were away hunting, to avoid them killing each other.                                       Farmers and herders, on the other hand, care more about years since that dictates when to plant, harvest, move their animals to new ground, etc. A hunter-gatherer who is asked their age might very well say 390, meaning 30 years, figuring about 13 moon cycles per year.  StuRat  15:47, 25 January 2006 (UTC)                                           It's pretty much the whole of Genesis where people live that long, most notably  Methusalem  (I once read that while waiting for someone in a hut in New Zealand that had a Gideon's bible in it). A little theory of mine is that since 666 is the  number of the beast  and the Devil is often portrayed as God upside-down, God may very well be 999. So reaching an age close to that means being close to God. Ok, that's a bit far-fetched.  DirkvdM  09:37, 26 January 2006 (UTC)                                                   I'll say. I believe some lived past that age, so would have surpassed even God, under your theory.

AllanHainey  08:50, 25 January 2006 (UTC)     [ edit ]   Organized religion   I was emailing with a friend last nite, and we were talking about organized religion (specifically the Catholic church). It seems to me that I remember seeing something in the book of revelations about organized religion leading people down the wrong path in the final days. Is there such a statement in the bible..........or did I read this somewhere else?     I don't know of anything in the  Book of Revelation ; it's never so straightforward as all that. See that article for info.       There are, however, some passages elsewhere that you could spin that way. I'd suggest using one of the many online ""search the Bible"" tools or, perhaps better, online concordances. Try  this site . -- George  17:17, 24 January 2006 (UTC)       Isn't all religion organised? I mean, religion is when people decide to have the same belief, and that is a form of organisation, right?  DirkvdM  20:54, 24 January 2006 (UTC)           Some religions and sects are more hierarchical, with the Catholic Church being perhaps the most so. Others, like the Quakers, leave much of the interpretation of the Bible to the members, rather than having somebody up high decide what it means and tell you what to believe.  StuRat  21:36, 24 January 2006 (UTC)                   So its a gradual thing, so the term makes no sense because there is always some level of organisation. One can only speak of 'more organised' religion.  DirkvdM  12:36, 25 January 2006 (UTC)                           There are also people who have their own unique religous beliefs, and aren't organized with others in any way. Perhaps this is what Revelations had in mind as the ideal.  StuRat  14:55, 25 January 2006 (UTC)                                   Yeah, but my point was that that is a  belief , not a  religion . At least, that is how I sort of define the terms. Then again, it makes littel sense to argue about the meaning of English terms when the question is about a book that is originally written in, ehm, what? Well, something that will be hard to discuss in English. Or even impossible. Which would make all discussions about Christianity and Judaism invalid because they're based on texts in dead languages. Or am I exaggerating now? (Not that I think  any  religious discussion makes any sense, but that's a differnt matter).  DirkvdM  20:45, 25 January 2006 (UTC)                                           Not a different matter at all, Dirk. It's very germane indeed. You've just acknowledged that you have a bias about this subject and thus your entire contribution to this debate is POV-tainted and should be taken with a grain of salt. (I've got to find ways of reducing my sodium intake. WP ref desk is a health hazard.) Cheers.  JackofOz  23:13, 25 January 2006 (UTC)                                                   If only people who lack any opinion on a subject may comment on it, then we will have many unanswerered questions here.  StuRat  01:26, 26 January 2006 (UTC)                                                           People who lack opinions would have nothing to contribute at all. Everyone has an opinion on certain things; sometimes those opinions are educated, sometimes they're baseless, sometimes they're in-between. Dirk says that he doesn't think  any  religious discussion makes sense, which is quite a sweeping statement. I don't quibble with his right to have that point of view, but equally nobody should quibble with my right not to give much credence to anything he said on the subject of religion, because it would be, by his own admission, inherently biased.  JackofOz  04:00, 26 January 2006 (UTC)                                                                   And of course  I  reserve the same right to ignore  you .Â :) What I meant to say is that religious discussions usually end the way they start, with people having different opinions. They may use all manner of argument but will only listen to themselves and stick to whichever preconception they started of with. I've seen this happen many times and decided I would never enter another religious discussion. Not very successfully, as you may have noticed. But the issue I raised is of a rather different nature. Can one discuss a book written in a language one doesn't quite understand? Especially one that is said to have indisputable truths that  may not be altered !  DirkvdM  09:53, 26 January 2006 (UTC)   And as Dirk's opinion is quite an educated opinion indeed, there should be no problem here.  Yeltensic42.618   don't   panic  16:10, 26 January 2006 (UTC)                                                                           Yes, translation from one language to another is an obvious conduit for the introduction of error. For example, the Biblical commandment ""Thou shalt not kill"" must be a misinterpretation, as the word ""kill"" in English means to intentionally end the life of any person, animal, plant, or even bacteria. Surely they didn't mean that. Either it means ""Thou shalt not kill people"" or perhaps ""Thous shalt not commit murder"" if some forms of killing people, such as during war, self defence, or capital punishment for crimes, are to be allowed. With the poor translation available to us, we don't really know the intent of the commandment.  StuRat  11:13, 26 January 2006 (UTC)    Knowing the mind of God has always been a toughie. The story is that Moses received the commandments on Mt Sinai from God Himself, who inscribed them with His finger on tablets of stone. I think most languages have a generic word equivalent to ""kill"", and that's the word God is supposed to have used, no more and no less. It would be wrong to translate this in any way other than the generic English word ""kill"". But interpreting what this means in practice is where the debate starts, eg. whether it's OK to kill flies but not humans, or whether it's OK to kill in self-defence but not out of anger, etc.  JackofOz  23:08, 26 January 2006 (UTC)                                             I've never read the book of revelation, but I'll just pass on what little I know. I guess you're thinking of the  antichrist . As that article states, he's not mentioned much in the bible, so it's open to interpretation, but some interpretations are that the antichrist will be a false teacher pretending to follow the teachings of Christ. Some believe he will be a religious or world leader. Anti-Catholics think he'll be (or even is now) the Pope. So there are interpretations where it's organized religion leading people astray. Probably the bible doesn't mention organized religion itself, that's only modern interpretation. - lethe   talk  21:20, 25 January 2006 (UTC)     I do not remember the name for it.

Can this editor (software) properly read a Word Documend such as a book and prepare if for ofset printing; or must the book or document be prepared originally in LaTeX?     As far as I know there is no way to convert a  Microsoft Word  document into  LaTeX  (or  TeX ), and in any case such would certainly run counter to the fundamental design principles of LaTeX. As for preparing a Word document for printing, commercial  desktop publishing  programs like  Adobe PageMaker  can import Word documents, but the quality of the results may vary a lot. In my experience, as often as not it can be easier to just export the document as  plain text  and recreate the formatting from scratch in the DTP program.  Ilmari Karonen   ( talk )  20:38, 24 January 2006 (UTC)           If you want to offset print a LaTeXdocument (or for that matter a Word document), I would recommend first converting it to the  PDF  format using  Adobe Acrobat  or other such software.

Preceding  unsigned  comment added by  66.227.239.174  ( talk    contribs )     According to our  Tower of Babel  article, the  Book of Jubilees  states that  its height amounted to 5433 cubits and 2 palms . Those units of measure are not precise, please see our articles  Cubit  and  Palm (unit) .  hydnjo   talk  00:16, 25 January 2006 (UTC)           That is only according to the Book of Jubilees.

Even 463 cubits would be 695 feet tall, or about 50% taller than the tallest Egyptian pyramid, which would seem like a stretch, but perhaps at least in the range of possibilities.

What would be the value of all the perks? I can think of:     Free housing for him and his family   Free medical care   Free meals, complete with a master chef   Free transportation   Secret Service protection     Basically, everything he needs is paid for. I'm thinking the total compensation must run tens of millions of dollars.   Preceding  unsigned  comment added by  64.164.146.127  ( talk    contribs )     Have you tried looking at the budget for the office of the president? You'll need to look in several places, though. Things like  Air Force One  and  Marine One  alone run to tens of millions of dollars a year. That and his use of the white house/executive branch staff are probably the two largest benefits, if you consider all the salaries added together.  Night Gyr  00:55, 25 January 2006 (UTC)       Consider this,  HMX-1 , the squadron that operates  Marine One , is about to spend six billion dollars to buy new helicopters. Their old helicopters lasted over 40 years, but that's still an average of almost 150 million per year.

I don't consider my work-related travel part of my benefits, why should the President of the United States, who probably gets a lot less time off to sightsee on his travels than I do? -- Robert Merkel  07:02, 25 January 2006 (UTC)           Agreed. He can't just rent out Air Force One and Marine One if he wants to, so they aren't really his. The Secret Service isn't just for their personal benefit, but also to protect the nation from the problems caused by assassinations, such as the need to declare war on whichever country or organization is thought to be responsible. Presidents have, however, basically rented out rooms of the White House, allowing contributors to their party or campaign to stay overnight in the Lincoln Bedroom, for example. Many in the US find this practice repulsive. So, distinguishing which perks are a form of compensation for the job and which are merely provided to aid in the performance of the job is a bit tricky. Perhaps the biggest perk is the resulting fame which can be turned into money by writing books, giving paid lectures, becoming a lobbyist, endorsing a product, etc. Fortunately no taxpayer dollars go into this.  StuRat  14:03, 25 January 2006 (UTC)                   Precisely. Hillary Clinton has to file income statements, including both her and Bill's earnings, as a Senator.

The most logical answer, I'd say, is that after the feb revolution they were kept alive and thus a threat to the revolution. Any monarchist counterrevolutions would have litte point if there is no monarch to put on the throne. Since any relative could be used for that, the whole family had to be killed. Being born into nobility usually has some serious perks, more so in Tsarist Russia, where the alternatives were pretty lousy to put it mildly, but in this case it was rather tough luck.

And them being inbred haemophiliacs, that shouldn't be too hard to acomplish.Â :)  DirkvdM  20:48, 25 January 2006 (UTC)    Hemophilia has nothing to do with inbreeding. -  Nunh-huh  22:13, 25 January 2006 (UTC)    Dirk, if that was Dutch humour, I don't much care for it. Sounds pretty insensitive to be appearing to advocate the killing, or the early death by disease, of a person just because they happen to be born into a royal family. Or maybe your English skills failed you this time.  JackofOz  23:07, 25 January 2006 (UTC)                           Hmmm, my humour  is  rather sharp at times, so maybe I should tone that down a bit (it  has  occasionally gotten a bit out of hand lately). But I thought that haemophilia (which is recessive and should therefore largely 'peter out') perpetuated in European royal families because they don't breed outside their own little circle. I don't know how this works, just something I picked up once (or twice). Is this some 'urban myth' then?  DirkvdM  10:01, 26 January 2006 (UTC)                                   No, that's quite correct. It's a recessive disease, meaning you need two such chromosomes to exhibit symptoms. The bad chromosome is fairly uncommon in the general population, so having two is quite rare. However, it was carried by the European royal families, which are inbred with one another, thus greatly increasing the chances a person will be born with two such chromosomes and exhibit syptoms. It was just bad luck that the royal families had this particular bad gene to begin with. On the other hand, the chances that any one individual will have at least one chromosome for some recessive disease is fairly good. If their descendents all interbreed, that makes the chances their offspring will exhibit some recessive disorder much greater. On the other hand, if those which exhibit the disease either die or are prevented from reproducing, this results in purging the bad chromosomes from the gene pool far quicker than would happen without interbreeding.                                       The effects of the disease have been dramatic. The son of the last Tsar of Russia suffered from the disease, which caused his mother to allow  Rasputin  into the palace to calm him down with a type of hypnotism, which lowered BP and thus limited bleeding. This weirdo then gained influence over the Tsar and Tsarina, causing a backlash of public hatred against them. The Russian nobles saw what was happening and murdered Rasputin (after several nearly simultaneous attempts) but it was too late. The Russian Revolution followed shortly afterward, changing the world forever.  StuRat  10:53, 26 January 2006 (UTC)    Actually, no, not quite. For haemophilia to be exhibited in a  female , she must have two such alleles. However, the relevant gene is present on the X chromosome, so males only need one allele (the Y chromosome is much shorter and doesn't have the gene to override that on the X chromosome, where as women have two X chromosomes).  Sam Korn   (smoddy)  19:55, 30 January 2006 (UTC)                           Heamophilia hasn't really been significant in the British royal family (or at least if there have been any occurrances they've kept it very quiet), probably more significant & well known to have affected the British is the disease nowadays attributed as causing ""The Madness of George III"" (filmed as  The madness of King George  as it was thought Americans would think it was a sequel to 2 films they hadn't seen) porphyria .

Logically, streets were subsequently laid out 8 to the mile. This means that every block in a typical Chicago neighborhood (in either North/South or East/West direction but rarely both) is precisely one furlong.     I grew up in Chicago and knew that there were 8 blocks to a mile but I can't figure out what that first sentence is supposed to mean. 800 what??  Dismas | (talk)  11:07, 25 January 2006 (UTC)     Just a wild ass guess from someone who's never been on the same continent as Chicago, but maybe house numbers? The spacing sounds a bit dense (one number every two meters), but I guess at least that way one wouldn't run out of numbers even in the most densely built areas.  Ilmari Karonen   ( talk )  13:51, 25 January 2006 (UTC)           That's my guess, too. The dense numbers might be needed for multi-family homes with multiple addresses. My Brother lives in such a home in Detroit, for example. Apartment buildings, on the other hand, generally have one address and then add an apartment number to distinguish between units.  StuRat  14:18, 25 January 2006 (UTC)               It isn't quite as dense as you think, as odd numbers only are used on one side of the street and even numbers only on the other side of the street.  Crypticfirefly  05:41, 26 January 2006 (UTC)           Note that in many cities (it sounds like Chicago is one such) street addresses increase by 100 per block. In the first block, buildings will be numbered starting with 1. In the next block, irrespective of the final building in the previous block, the first number will be 101.  Grutness ... wha?  07:51, 27 January 2006 (UTC)           Wow, that's useful. Here, addresses are always assigned continuously, and when you need more numbers, they use things like 3/A, 3/B etc. That way you only have to renumber a street only if it's extended on the end which previously had number 1. That can still cause some trouble at some places but of course it can't happen here in the city.   b_jonas  13:45, 28 January 2006 (UTC)         I thought I might just point out our article on  House numbering , an article which is sort of relevant to this discussion! --  Chuq  03:14, 30 January 2006 (UTC)     [ edit ]   Drinking Songs   Okiedokie.

I heard that just a few decades ago the Brits (or more specifically English, I believe) bathed on average once a week. Never mind showering, showers probably didn't even exist then in England. Then again, showering too often, and especially when you use soap, is addictive. The body will adapt and get smelly quicker, so you have to bathe again sooner, etc. So they may not have smelled that bad. Anyway, what's  bad ? Not bathing makes you smell of yourself. Getting rid of that will make you alienate from yourself. Smell is a very potent mood-determinant. So losing your smell is like losing yourself. And to top this off, if  everyone  smelled like that, we wouldn't notice. So it's really everyone else who've got it wrong. (especially in the US, where it seems people bathe more than once a day and put on a 'clean' shirt every day).  DirkvdM  21:03, 25 January 2006 (UTC)                   I thought by 'Bad Teeth' that they meant  Austin Powers  style  malocclusions .

Once a year or some such. If they got a bit whiffy, they just put on some lavender water, but they didnt think of having a bath. So maybe its a stereotype which started among the early non-English settlers in North America.  Jameswilson  00:09, 26 January 2006 (UTC)                                   Of course, if we go back far enough, pretty much nobody anywhere bathed regularly. I would have guessed that was because the cost of soap, a bathtub, and fuel to heat the water was beyond most people then. However, rich people bathed infrequently, too. I'm not sure why they preferred to stink rather than bathe.  StuRat  10:36, 26 January 2006 (UTC)                       I seem to recall reading that drinking tea can discolor teeth worse than coffee or smoking. But they don't smell - that's your upper lip.  KWH           Hmm, then perhaps the accumulation of chemicals there explains why the British have bad breath  and  why it's always so stiff (the British upper lip, that is).  Confusing Manifestation  15:54, 26 January 2006 (UTC)           The British mother of a school friend of mine had bad teeth, she remarked once that it was the result of poor nutrition during WWII when she was growing up.  Crypticfirefly  05:36, 26 January 2006 (UTC)     I didn't think it was British people that smelled bad. I thought that was a stereotype of the French. Actually, I used to live in a Continental country (not France), and there clearly was a major issue with smell among some people. Perhaps one out of 10 natives bathed maybe once a week. So if you got on a crowded bus, the chances are, it would smell. Why do they take fewer showers than Americans? No idea. Perhaps it's because utilities and deodorant are expensive on their wages. More likely, no one has ever told them that they smell bad. --  Mwalcoff  23:12, 26 January 2006 (UTC)         StuRat, I think it had less to with cost and more to do with the idea that bathing was dangerous, but again that could just be an myth.

User:Zoe | (talk)  16:30, 25 January 2006 (UTC)         The movie Fargo is a stereotype. They do not talk like that.   They really talk like the folks on  Garrison Keillor 's  Prairie Home Companion , if you want to hear the accent.  alteripse  22:00, 25 January 2006 (UTC)   Some people there really do talk like that. I have an e-mail friend in Sioux Falls, South Dakota who sort of has the accent. Also, the distance matters less in the Great Plains than the Northeast, since it's a matter of population density more than area, but the distance between Fargo and Minneapolis still matters nonetheless.  Yeltensic42.618   don't   panic  23:32, 25 January 2006 (UTC)     The isolation of an area is the main factor. If people from City X and City Y regularly moved to each other's cities, I would expect a similar accent in both. If they don't, then I wouldn't expect the same accent.  StuRat  01:08, 26 January 2006 (UTC)           Exactly. And because the Northeast is more densely populated, with New York and Boston being part of a continuous urban belt (BosWash), there is likely more travel between them than between Fargo and Minneapolis.  Yeltensic42.618   don't   panic  01:17, 26 January 2006 (UTC)                   And whoops, there goes your theory, since there are much larger differences in accents between 40 mile distances between Boston and Washington than between 200 mile distances in the north central plains.  alteripse  02:48, 26 January 2006 (UTC)                           I don't believe that a densely populated area in between two cities assures heavy travel between them.  StuRat  04:16, 26 January 2006 (UTC)                                   Actually, come to think of it the high population density could mean  less  travel between the two cities, as each small area is more self-sufficient (ie Bostonians don't have to go to New York to buy anything).  Yeltensic42.618   don't   panic  06:58, 26 January 2006 (UTC)                                       But actually, I'm pretty certain I've read that it has to do with the population density (that's why cities like New York and London have different accents within the city). So it probably has little to do with people moving between the two cities. In retrospect, my post about the ""whoops theory"" was a pretty glaring error, whether or not the ""moving theory"" is right. I need to stop posting while listening to music.  Yeltensic42.618   don't   panic  06:58, 26 January 2006 (UTC)                     According to our  Fargo  article:     The accents used by characters in the film are a stereotypical overapplication of  North Central American English . Actual spoken language in Minnesota deviates little from  General American .     StuRat  01:15, 26 January 2006 (UTC)   It also varies from area to area. In some parts of Minnesota and the Dakotas, the accent many people have isn't far off from the movie; in other areas it is entirely different.  Yeltensic42.618   don't   panic  01:18, 26 January 2006 (UTC)     I used to have a friend from northern Minnesota, where Fargo takes place. She did sound somewhat like the people in the movie. She told me there really are two Minnesotas: the southern, agricultural one and the northern one where all the lakes are. --  Mwalcoff  23:05, 26 January 2006 (UTC)           Some people in northern MN sound like the people in the movie. Some people sound like ""generic Americans"". You might also meet people with Fargo-like accents in Minneapolis, and other areas around the state, in part because the accent isn't confined to the north and in part because plenty of people move around in the state.  Mwalcoff 's friend is basically right in terms of geography, but that division doesn't really separate the people, and especially not their accents.  kmccoy   (talk)  02:10, 1 February 2006 (UTC)           [ edit ]   Australians   Going on from the question above about British people.

Now, as for circuses in the US, they have been in a period of decline for many decades now, so only a few remain. Smaller circuses, like the one you mentioned, are likely defunct. The reasons for this decline include:     Competition from new forms of entertainment, like TV, video games, and the Internet.       Popular feeling that forcing animals to do tricks is unethical, and they are best viewed in their natural habitat, engaging in natural behaviour, or as close as we can get in a zoo or wildlife santuary.       Concern that animals may be abused in a circus.       Reduced availability and increased cost for exotic animals like lions and elephants.       Popular feeling that looking at deformed or diseased people for entertainment is unethical. People still do this, but prefer to do it in the privacy of their own home, say by watching the Jerry Springer Show.

Yeah, Sony is the only company using memory sticks and they're rather pushy about it, so it makes sense the playstation only uses memory sticks (and umd's - also by Sony). See the frame in  PlayStation Portable  (could have done that yourself!).   By the way, I thought that CF cards were the most popular. Am I out of date or is this a regional difference? I'm from the Netherlands.  DirkvdM  10:13, 26 January 2006 (UTC)    Depends, Dirk. At the photography studio I work at, they live on Compact Flash. My grandmother uses SecureDigital, and so did I for a time (with my color palm that ended up dying a very messy death). Anyone with Sony products uses Memory Sticks; most Fuji devices rely on XD cards, which are the same width as an SD card but are half as long (so if you tried to use it in an SD slot, you'd lose it...). For data transfer, most people will use a thumb drive. I use a combination of a thumb drive and an SD card just to be a prick, but for digital images...eh, I've confused myself. To put it simply: CF is very popular, and is generally accepted as the de facto image storage thingy.

A Friend of my friend travelled to USA and said that there he had easy sex with womans that are very beatiful?     For similar reasons certain parts of the developing world think that all Western women are sluts, as you so bluntly put it. ""They"" get a very distorted picture from portrayals in the media, both journalistic and fictional, and also from the tourist places they tend to visit. Their mental picture of Brazil probably starts at the scantily clad women on the beaches of  Rio de Janeiro , and ends with the  Carnival .       That said, the USA is a very large and diverse country. Don't assume because *some* Americans have an unrealistic view of your country, that all of them do. And don't think you're immune to unrealistic views about other countries. I work at a university in Australia.

There is, however, also the (stronger?) notion that girls in the US are easy lays. This is based more on actual experience from people who have been there.  DirkvdM  10:20, 26 January 2006 (UTC)   Since you're in Europe, that might just be because American women are particularly attracted to European men, so it's easy for them to score when they come over here. In the U.S., there's also a notion that European girls are sluts. Maybe this is a recurring pattern, that people think women in other countries are sluts?  Yeltensic42.618   don't   panic  16:01, 26 January 2006 (UTC)                   I'm a Brazilian and I must admit these views are actually very realistic and valid.

If you allow too much slack in any of the bead strands they will hang down in your face, anyway. Also, they are rather slippery and it's hard to hold all the strands at the same time. Tying the strands together at both sides then ducking down thru the opening might be the only way to be sure you won't get hit in the face. They really are quite annoying.

My understanding is that it was not fluted but rather shallow and supported by a stem approximately 4 inches in height. I am also led to believe that it was formed by the shape of Josephine's breast at the request of Napolean.   Dave W.     From what I've heard, the coupe glass as it's called, wasn't originally designed for champagne. Which makes sense because it's a pretty lousy glass for it. (Actually, it's quite likely the  worst  possible design for a champagne glass) Which is why they're rarely used today. As for the breast-story, that seems to be a  myth  which has gone around in several versions. -- BluePlatypus  14:59, 26 January 2006 (UTC)           More commonly called a  champagne flute .

Any ideas why these were taken off the market?     VHS tapes in general are being phased out in favor of DVDs. Less popular VHS tapes will be the first to go. I am guessing 9 hour VHS tapes might be less popular because they offer lower quality imagesÂ ?  StuRat  14:14, 26 January 2006 (UTC)           I'm also guessing these are actually  4 hour  tapes, marketted as ""9 hour"" because many VCRs can record on ""Long Play"", using half the tape in exchange for a reduction in quality. 4 hour tapes aren't actually all that uncommon (at least not in the UK) although most are 3 hour - which if I'm right could equally be called ""6 hour"". -  IMSoP  15:46, 26 January 2006 (UTC)                   The reason for the lower popularity and gradual disappearance of 4-hour/""9-hour"" tapes is that the only way for the manufacturer to get that much tape into the casing is to use thinner tape than is used in all other sizes. Not only does that cause a reduced-quality image on-screen, but it also makes such tapes  much  more likely to snap apart during normal wear and tear. When that happens, you'll lose access to whatever you recorded on that tape at best; at worst, the tape will spin out inside your VCR and gum up the entire player, possibly to the point where the VCR will no longer function. Obviously, this sort of outcome is not what most tape manufacturers like, because it just increases the likelihood that somebody will sue them for selling ""junk tapes"" that ruined their player. Between that and the fact that people stopped buying them once they realized you could only play them back a certain number of times before the already-bad image quality got even worse, it pretty much doomed that tape size. (The exact same thing has happened with audio cassettes; they make (or used to make, anyway ... who knows these days) cassettes with something like 240 minutes of recording time, and they did it the same way, by using thinner tape. The resulting problems were identical.) -- Aaron  21:12, 26 January 2006 (UTC)                           Well, of course you need not lose whatever was on the tape because there is such a thing as sticky tape.Â :) Does this also go for 4 hour tapes? Because that's the standard length I use. Haven't noticed any problem with it yet and my oldest tapes are about 10 years old. Also, quality-wise the most important thing would have been if VHS had not become the standard. Either Betamax or Video 2000, but not VHS. I've tested it against Betamax (two new VHS recorders versus two  very old  Betamaxes), and the difference was huge. VHS was crap by the 3rd generation copy, while Betamax was still better than that by the 5th generation, if I remember correctly.  DirkvdM  21:44, 26 January 2006 (UTC)                   To clarify IMSoP's comment, VHS VCRs have  three  speeds, SP (short play), LP (long play), and EP or SLP (extended or super-long play). I believe most machines record at the fast and slow speeds only, but play back all three. When we speak of a 9-hour tape we mean its length at EP (SLP); it would be 3 hours at SP or 6 hours at LP. 8 and 10-hour tapes (at EP (SLP)) also exist, but I don't know what lengths are currently marketed. The original poster should try other stores or contact a tape manufacturer to see what is now available. --Anonymous, 03:15 UTC, January 27.       [ edit ]   what is meant by a graded river?

I'm used to msWindows crashing (often more than once a day), which is why I changed to (Suse) Linux about a year ago. Which went ok until today. I wanted to continue a multisession dvd+r with  K3b , but didn't see any 'import' or such, so I thought, ah well, just 'start a new dvd project' and drag a bunch of files in the 'project-frame' and see what happens. Seemed to go ok. The burning finished with an 'completed successfully' message and the dvd was ejected. I pushed it in again to see what exactly had happened and then everything froze. Ctrl-Alt-Del didn't work either (didn't even know that had a function under Linux, but it has always been my first reaction under msWindows, so I did it automatically). And I couldn't eject the dvd either. Restarting only worked if I removed the dvd while the computer restarted. But then when I tried the dvd again, Linux froze again. The whole OS, not just one application (although even that rarely happens, but it never crashes Linux). Of course, without using the dvd there's no problem, but I'd still like to know what happened. Funny thing is, msWindows (98)  can  read the dvd (although it gives the wrong total size as 2 GB when it's really about 4 GB). But it doesn't show any of the files (photos) I had added (I thought).   While I'm at it (though I doubt if this has anything to do with it). About a month ago I had the problem that Linux wouldn't start because of a problem with fschk (I think that's what it's called). I solved that by restarting with 'shutdown -f now', which skips the file system check. That's merely a workaround and I've been too lazy to look into it, but can it cause any problems (in the long run)?  DirkvdM  15:47, 26 January 2006 (UTC)     Hmm.. seems like there may be problems with that DVD, and that perhaps your desktop software is buggy in how it's handling it. Are you sure the whole system froze? Could you switch to a virtual terminal (e.g. Ctrl-Alt-F2) and kill the offending program from there? Or if X Windows was freezing, you could try Ctrl-Alt-Backspace (which is usually configured to kill X immediately). Not being able to eject the DVD is normal, because the OS locks the drive while it's mounted, you need to unmount it first (""umount /media/cdrecorder"" or wherever your mountpoint is). Of course, despite what some say, sometimes Linux does actually crash. I've seen it. (although it's mostly been attributable to flakey hardware) As for when Linux has problems with the fsck on start, it'll usually dump you in a command-line where you can run it manually. That usually fixes stuff, and it'll boot normally the next time. In the long run, you should of course run fsck regularily, but the kernel will usually do that for you on boot if a certain number of days has elapsed since the last check. -- BluePlatypus  17:11, 26 January 2006 (UTC)       Run fsck, Dirk...it's never a good idea to not do that.

Compared to that, one (avoidable) crash per year is hardly a problem. And don't start with XP because that's even worse - after a few months it even completely died on me and refuses to restart (in any mode). Good thing I never paid for it.   It seems like it's not just X Windows. Neither Ctrl-Alt-Backspace nor Ctrl-Alt-F2 had any effect. Ah well, I'll just do the dvd again and next time figure out how to continue a session properly. One silly question, though. Once I'm in a terminal, how do I start X Windows up again?   But if fsck is really important I want to know about that. When I run that (either during startup or after it in a terminal), I get ""dev/sda5 mounted with write permission, cannot check it. Run manually."" But I thought I  was  running it manually. sda5 is where the system resides (forgot about that, mounted it in a new mountpoint and was surprised to find the root dir there - took me a minute figure out what I was looking at. That's how little I know about LinuxÂ :) ).  DirkvdM  20:58, 26 January 2006 (UTC)    Omigod, a Linux question I know the answer for! You need to either boot to a rescue disk (and I don't know how to make one, so don't even think about asking), or turn your system off inappropriately (I prefer flipping the master switch on the power supply; if yours doesn't have one, turn off the power strip instead). Turn it back on; more recent versions of Linux's varying flavors will ask you the question, ""System was not unmounted cleanly -- Press y within 5 seconds to force file system check."" When you see it, slam on the Y key as hard as you can, then go make yourself a cup of coffee (depending on how big your hard drive is, you might need two or three ^_~). You  could  run fsck on a mounted filesystem if you want, but logic dictates that if an application tells you ""NO"" then you should listen to it. fscking a mounted filesystem will more than likely cause its boyfriend to become jealous--er...I mean...it could potentially damage it.

Wicca celebrates the four stations and passes of the sun ( Midsummer's Day ,  Midwinter's Day , and the spring and autumn equinoxes), plus  Imbolc  (first point of spring - February 1 in the northern hemisphere),  Beltane  (May 1, sometimes simply known as May Day),  Lughnasa  (August 1) and  Samhain  (November 1). Of these, the two most important are Beltane (probably the answer you're looking for) and Samhain (which a lot of people who should know better think of as being the same as Hallowe'en)   Saying ""Witches celebrate Hallowe'en"" isn't really correct. Hallowe'en is actually an old Christian day (literally ""Hallow E'en"" - the evening before All Hallows - i.e., All Saint's Day). It occurs close to the start of a far earlier pagan celebration that lasted for an entire week, commemorating the beginning of winter and the spirits of those who died during the year. This started on the night before Samhain (usually pronounced Sowain, BTW) with a welcoming in of the dead with treats or trying to trick them into leaving the house (this is the origin of trick or treat, and also the Mexican Dia del Muerte). The dead were regarded as honoured guests for a week, then sent off to eternity with a big feast and bonfire (it's no coincidence that many nortehrn European countries traditionally had bonfire, often with a symbolic sacrifice of an effigy, about a week into November. The most famous is Britain's ""Guy Fawke's night""... also see the movie ""The wicker man"" for further reference).

Cernen   Xanthine   Katrena  17:45, 26 January 2006 (UTC)   Are you talking about iTunes for Windows or for Mac? The Mac version does support some players other than the iPod  see here for the list ; the Windows version is iPod-only. However, even on the Mac version, you'll still be limited by the fact that all songs sold by the iTunes Music Store are in AAC Protected format, and will only play on an iPod. (You can buy the songs and then convert them to MP3 if you want.) As for converting, it depends on whether you're on a Mac or PC, and what you want to convert them into. There are all sorts of conversion programs out there, and iTunes itself can convert some stuff, but you'll have to tell us precisely what sort of files you have. Are they songs you bought from the iTunes store, or just stuff you've grabbed off the net? -- Aaron  20:30, 26 January 2006 (UTC)       [ edit ]   Food   What is a strong smelling Belgian cheese -- 195.92.67.75  16:37, 26 January 2006 (UTC)     La crotte du diable.

Anyway, reformatted, by  Cernen   Xanthine   Katrena .)   I am wondering if you can help me. I am wanting to locate someone who would know something about my grand dad. Where would I be able to find this out? I am wanting vital statistics information on him.   His name he used in the United States was John Krist Diamond. His family was from Serres Macedonia before the Greeks came in. At that time (1903) he came to the United States and lived in Gary Indiana. I know who his mom and dad were, his birthday date and that he had sisters. I know that he was Greek Orthodox. He always told my mom that he was from Athens, however, he also mentioned Serres. I don't know exactly when he left or what boat he took. I sure would appreciate it if you could help me somehow or tell me where to look.   Here's the information I know.   John Krist Diamond, born Feb 5 1888, father Krist Kristalis born in Serres, mother Kaliope Diamontis born in Serres. sisters Theodora and Magdalene Diamontis. I do not know their birth dates. He named his own children Magdalene(my mom), Krist and Theodora.   I have a close Macedonia friend who explained to me that he probably ran away to escape harm in the revolution. His age would fit in with that as well as his departure date which may be 1903 but others have said 1904 or 5. The port he came to in the US was Baltimore. My friend said he may have told everyone he was from Greece because at the time Macedonians were being persecuted.   As I said I am wanting to know what part of my information is correct or incorrect. I would like to know if I have anyone in Serres that may be family. Thanks for listening to me and I hope that you can get me on the right track.   My best regards, Lynn Moore     I would suspect that you probably do have relatives in Serres. You already know quite a bit about this person. I would crack open a Gary IN phone book and call the Greek Orthodox churches (there probably aren't very many) and ask if they have any records of him.       As far as government records, those may be a bit more tricky. You can go to your local library and use their geneology portal on their computer network to look up whatever records may be available. I'm saying the library because they oftentimes pay subscriptions to Ancestry.com and other related sites so you don't have to.       If you actually want to find relatives in Serres, this project is a perfect excuse to vacation there! Get all you can on him here and research (ask your Macedonian friend) what governmental outlets for records are open to the public over there, try to figure out what churches may have records, what his name was over there and so on. You can and should try to do as much of this as you can online and over the phone, but eventually going there may be the only way to cross some hurdals that will no doubt come up in this research.       You can probably trace forward one or so generations of his descendants (before the documents are blocked for privacy), just enough to find someone alive who can plug you into everyone else alive. Church records may be your best bet. Good luck! - LambaJan  19:17, 29 January 2006 (UTC)       Our  Genealogy  article contains some useful information.

DirkvdM  21:08, 26 January 2006 (UTC)                   I remember watching footage of Queen Elizabeth II's last royal visit to the USA. Ordinary Americans were being interviewed in the street and they were all saying things like ""Oh, it's wonderful that  the queen  is coming to our town"". Seems ""the queen"" is sufficient to identify her in countries that don't have a monarchy. Anyone hearing ""the queen"" would know who was being talked about. There are other queens in the world (not all of them females either), but I think only QE2 gets to be called ""the queen"" by Commmonwealth and non-Commonwealth people alike.  JackofOz  22:40, 26 January 2006 (UTC)                           I would only expect that in current or former British colonies.  StuRat  13:56, 27 January 2006 (UTC)    You're right. I had already clarified that (below). I think we're talking about the same set of countries, though. I can't think of an English-speaking country (ie. where English is an official language) outside the Commonwealth, that was never a British possession. That seems to be the way the language was introduced to the place. Same for former Spanish, Portuguese, French ... colonies. A country doesn't just decide to adopt a language because it sounds nice. Pity the world doesn't work that way.  JackofOz  21:28, 27 January 2006 (UTC)                       Not all queens female? They are all female. Not all of the monarchs are queens, though. Usually when I refer to ""The Queen"" it's the queen of the  Netherlands . We call QE2 The Queen of England around here and I'm sure there's similar cases elsewhere. Specifying a country is still a good idea. -  Mgm | (talk)  09:13, 27 January 2006 (UTC)       I'm sure you're right about the Netherlands. This would also apply in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Spain, Thailand and other countries that have a queen (regnant or consort). ""The queen"" in those countries would of course refer to their own queen, not QE2. But I did say ""in countries that don't have a monarchy"", although I guess what I really meant was English-speaking countries that are not part of the Commonwealth of Nations. If you were in Ireland, South Africa, USA, Pakistan, Fiji, or many other countries, ""the queen"" would not refer to, say, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, but almost certainly to Queen Elizabeth II of the UK despite not being their head of state. BTW the bit about not all queens being female was a reference to another meaning of ""queen"" - a flamboyant male homosexual. Sorry if that was too flippant, but I couldn't resist it. Cheers  JackofOz  11:15, 27 January 2006 (UTC)           Neither  Queen (band)  nor  Ellery Queen  are female. The first example may be your suggested usage of the word, LOL.

Maybe he's doing a game and occasionally sneaking away to the computer, pretending to go for a piss. What will people be thinking about the size of his bladder?   By the way, he asks about  a  national anthem, so the question leaves that open. And anyway, if not, why should the US be assumed? There are dozens of English-speaking nations in the world (together with a population that is way bigger than that of the US). And some of us are from non-English speaking countries (such as yours truly). After all, English is the world's lingua franca, which has it's advantages for the native speakers, but also some disadvantages - they can't assume readers here to be native English speakers.  DirkvdM  21:23, 26 January 2006 (UTC)    I thought they might be from the U.S. because Americans often come here with questions and say things like ""the president"" or ""my country"" and they act like everyone should just know that they're talking about the U.S. It's a common thing here at the Ref desk.

JackofOz  21:11, 27 January 2006 (UTC)       [ edit ]   Stock Market   In the U.S. If there was no stock market, no stocks, and no exchanges, how different would the ecomomy be? How would capitalism be different?     Do you mean only individual ownership of businesses would be allowedÂ ? This would slow the growth rate of new businesses dramatically by reducing the available capital. On the plus side, companies would be managed more responsibly (for long term growth, not for quaterly profits).  StuRat  20:40, 26 January 2006 (UTC)           It would also greatly reduce the amount of natural stimulus to start up new companies at all. No stock market would mean no possibility of one day getting a big payout for all your years of work by going public. Imagine no Apple Computer, no Yahoo, no Google ... or, at best, far smaller and less inventive versions of those companies. Then multiply that thousands of times to cover all the hundreds of thousands of other companies that would never have gotten off the ground because there wasn't that much in it for the creators. An argument could easily be made that the American economy as we know it - the entire global economy, really - would not exist today without stocks. Capitalism could survive, but as StuRat said, it would be much more slothful, possibly so much so that it wouldn't be able to support the number of humans that currently exist. We'd probably be at least 75 years behind technologically as well. -- Aaron  21:21, 26 January 2006 (UTC)                   I'd say, without stocks there would be no accumulation of capital and therefore no capitalism. Living in a capitalist world it's hard to imagine what that might look like. There are historical examples, but not in the US (is that why the question is limited to the US?). In Europe stock exchange only started in the 16th century, I believe (I'm thinking about the  VOC  now). The present population surviving wouldn't require big companies. Just cooperation. Which could be on a small scale per occasion (sort of an anarchistic model, rather like the  kibutzim ). Or just plain big, potentially even bigger than any existing company. And that's one thing you're missing. Big projects can also be undertaken by a government. Even a small government is more powerful (not only financially but certainly socially) than any company. Maybe it took a Dutchman to come up with this.Â :) We may not have state socialism, but we've got enough socialism to imagine what it could be like.  DirkvdM  21:34, 26 January 2006 (UTC)                           Of course there are many companies which don't have stock now, perhaps most businesses. Most of those are small businesses. Instead of having a few car companies that makes dozens of models each, there might be dozens of car companies making a single model each (which is how it was 75 years ago). I suspect you would get more innovation out of all those companies; some would build electric cars, some would build ethanol cars, some would build hydrogen powered cars, etc. The same model might hold for other businesses, too.  StuRat  21:43, 26 January 2006 (UTC)                               I don't see how the stock market is the only way to accumulate capital and create capitalism. Both the banking and money-lending industries go back much further than that. Certainly investment in one form or another has always existed, it can be something as simple as lending someone the tools to build a mill in exchange for some future flour. The stock market is just a form of insurance, enabling the risks to be spread among investors. While, a government can do that job as well, they don't have as much money to invest. (Compare the total value of a small country's stock exchange with their state budget) Empirically, economic growth was quite a lot slower in communist countries. (It's also a much more difficult system to handle. Invest in a new factory or hire 1,000 new school teachers? -That's a pretty tough equation to solve.) -- BluePlatypus  22:51, 26 January 2006 (UTC)                                   I suppose that by 'communist country' you mean something like the USSR. But what would you compare with then? With other countries or with the same country without the socialist rule? Russia had barely escaped the middle ages by the time of the revolution; largely agrarian (and barely successfull at that) hardly any industries or urbanisation and serfdom had only recently been abolished. Considering that, their progress may very well be regarded as the economic hit of the 20th century. From the middle ages to first country in space in a mere 40 years - quite an achievement.                                       Cuba hasn't dome so well (depending on how you define 'well'), but what would have come of it if it had been a capitalist country without the aid of the US? Without that they were already poor. And how have poor capitalist countries fared? They're mostly still poor. There are more poor than rich capitalist countries, so one can't say the continued poverty has anything to do with the socio-economic system in use. There are just too few examples to base any scientific theory on (just a handful of countries). And it all happened hardly under laboratory conditions. So there is no statistical basis for any such conclusion. The only thing one can say is that most countries that are rich now started off rich at the advent of industrialisation (or where in time should one start comparing?). So it's money that makes money, more than the economic system.  DirkvdM  09:58, 27 January 2006 (UTC)                                           I disagree. For a good head-to-head comparison of capitalism and communism, look at South Korea (with a GDP per capital of US$20,300) and North Korea (with a GDP per capital of US$1800). This difference took some 50 years. With more time, even more of a difference would be expected, as the North has an economic growth rate of 1% while the South is at 3.7%.                                               For another example, China languished in poverty under communism and suffered from starvation until they began to allow capitalism. At that point their economy took off, and has been skyrocketing ever since.                                               I do, however, think that all totalitarianism is bad for a country's economy, not just communist totalitarianism. Essentially, there is no point in working hard to grow wealth if somebody is just going to steal it from you, which can happen in any totalitarian country. African, Asian, and South American countries under such systems have not fared well, while those with democratic governments tend to do better in the long run. Since communist countries were almost all under some form of totalitarian rule before their revolutions, there may not be much apparent change in the economy as a result.  StuRat  13:51, 27 January 2006 (UTC)                                                   Well, like I said, there are too few examples to really reach a conclusion. You give just two examples, but there are more than a hundred countries for which this is not true. And also look at Russia. I don't know how well the country as a whole is doing after the fall of the socialist state, but for many people (most?) things haven't quite improved, to puit it mildly. This is what I meant by ""depending on how you define 'well'"".   And totalitariansm is  potentially  better for the economy than democracy. Just look at Singapore. It's just that most totalitarian leaders will not be able to resist the temptation to only think about their own well-being. Power corrupts, especially too much power in the hands of one person. Combine that with the fact that people who come to such power are usually hardly the kind of people who can run a country and one must conclude that Castro is doing surprisingly well (given those circumstances, I mean). And in the case of China, the one-child policy (which started in the 1950's) must have been a blow to the economy after about 20 years and maybe that is now finally starting to pay off. Just a guess, but it sounds plausible. And another consideration is that most (all) socialist states were a result of a revolution and a revolution is never good for an economy. Then again, a fresh start is often good and the USSR wasn't bothered by old and obsolete equipment, like England at the time. And maybe they learned from the mistakes of 'the West'. Again, I don't know, just pondering.   But ultimaltely, we can reason and compare all we like, but the main thing is that there are too few examples to base any reliable conclusions on.  DirkvdM  16:23, 27 January 2006 (UTC)                                       It is also possible that there could be stocks but no stock market. You could still have ownership of companies, even ownership divided between people. However transfer of ownership would be (presumably) more complicated, maybe having to rewrite the company documents to reflect the new ownership. The main difference would presumably be that it would be very much more difficult to raise large amounts of capital - you would have to rely on a few rich individuals or organisations rather than a big mass of moderately wealthy ones. What I would imagine happening is that moderately wealthy people would get together into groups and have the group buy up part-ownership of companies.                       One possible positive result of the absence of a stock-market would be that ownership of a company would be much more for the long term. People would only own part of a company if they really believed in its future, rather than the gambling-like approach that many people take today.  DJ Clayworth  16:56, 27 January 2006 (UTC)                   When comparing varying economic systems, it's absolutely essential to look at them within a global-political context. In the case of North and South Korea, which country do you think does more trade with wealthy nations? and why?               Also, DJ Clayworth, I totally agree with you. That could be a very healthy economy, those companies resembling co-ops and credit unions. - LambaJan  19:53, 29 January 2006 (UTC)           [ edit ]   Gmail   Is there a way to contact the staff at  Gmail ?

I've seen this applied to  Chuck Norris ,  Vin Diesel , and most recently to  Lofa Tatupu  by an over-zealous football fan. A  section of the Vin Diesel article  mentions this phrase but doesn't say where it's first use was. It references the  Bill Brasky  sketches as predating other uses, but our article would seem to say that it wasn't used, let alone orginated, in those sketches.

I know that www.4q.cc has random ""facts"" about Vin Diesel, and Chuck Norris. I use ""facts"" extremely loosely, because they are actually not facts at all, but rather statements that poke fun at the bad-boy image that these guys have on TV / in movies. For instance:     The Tower of Pisa leans because Chuck Norris kicked it once while on vacation.   Chuck Norris owns and operates his own restaurant in Lubbock, Texas. Knuckle sandwiches are the only thing on the menu.   Vin Diesel is an alternate identity created by the government's most successful assasin.

The Vin Diesel section linked to in the query has another site with similar stuff as the one you mentioned. Due to the nature of these sites, I find it unlikely that they would have spawned such widespread and uniform use as the phrase is always quoted exactly as I have shown it. Also, it is commonly used by people in a non-satirical way, although that could be lovely irony. I assumed it is from some Chuck Norris movie, but I haven't found a citation.

A friend wants to scare his sister with it (she was terrified of the movie) Thanx  Zach  22:21, 26 January 2006 (UTC)     I googled some possible translations into Latin and the most popular one seems to be ""ego sum qui intus habitat"". Does that sound right?  Keenan Pepper  01:15, 27 January 2006 (UTC)     'habitat' sounds wrong to me - I would expect 'habito'. In the same way, the English 'dwells' sounds wrong to me - I would expect 'dwell'. In each case, the subject is first person, I or ego (picked up by the relative pronoun who/qui). Ego sounds right to me - the emphasis is needed.  Maid Marion  09:11, 27 January 2006 (UTC)         The problem with those auto translators is that they translate the words, not the meaning.  Sum  means ""I am."" The  ego  is unnecessary unless you are intending to put the emphasis solely on I. This translation implies that it is more important that _I_ am... rather than someone else.  Habitat  is in the third person indicative. I believe this is wrong because it isn't the main verb of the sentence. As it stands now, I think it has two main verbs. You will get a better answer if you ask on the language desk for translation help. I also want to qualify this answer with the statement that I have had 1 1/2 years of intense schooling and life experiences separating me from my Latin practice.  WAvegetarian  CONTRIBUTIONS TALK    EMAIL 08:18, 27 January 2006 (UTC)         The phrase is not classical latin, but seems to be back translated from English or German. It is probably intended to mean ""I am he who dwells within"". The reason habitat is in 3rd person rather than first is that the subject is qui, not ego-- it is a third person verb phrase.  alteripse  11:24, 27 January 2006 (UTC)   Are you sure alteripse? I haven't met the term 'third person verb phrase', but that's probably my ignorance. Usually when qui refers back to ego (or tu) it is followed by a verb in the first (or second) person. For a familiar example, see the Lord's prayer in Latin: Pater noster, qui es in caelo (not qui est). Similarly, in the old-fashioned English translation: Our Father, which art in heaven (not which is).  Maid Marion  13:40, 27 January 2006 (UTC)     It's third person in English, too: ""I am he who dwell s  within."". It's called a  relative clause .       ""Ego sum qui intus habitat."" sounds like perfectly correct Latin to me. Why do you say it's not classical Latin, alteripse?  Keenan Pepper  17:26, 27 January 2006 (UTC)     Don't you think classical latin has a more ""foreign"" syntactical feel to it? When you see a phrase that can be translated word for word into a modern english sentence it may be grammatically correct latin but I bet it would have an alien flavor to a 50 AD Roman. For example, its not hard to ""feel"" the difference between even good ecclesiastical latin and real classical latin-- ecclesiastical is always much easier to translate and there are rarely words that seem to be missing. I have always assumed that was because it was never the native ""living language"" of the modern writers. That sentence just feels like it was written in a modern language and translated.  alteripse  00:21, 28 January 2006 (UTC)               To be more explicit, ""qui intus habitat"" (which could be expanded to something like ""homo qui intus habitat"") is a phrase which functions as a noun. If you wanted to say ""I, who dwell within..."" it would be ""Ego, qui intus habito..."" which would then be followed by a first person main verb. But in this case, the relative clause does not apply to the subject ""ego"", but to the implicit predicate. You wouldn't have a problem with ""Ego sum homo qui intus habitat."", would you?  Keenan Pepper  17:36, 27 January 2006 (UTC)         Or, more idiomatically, 'Ego sum ille qui intus habitat'. Maid Marion  10:32, 30 January 2006 (UTC)             Doesn't the form ""ego sum"" stress that it is  I  - rather than somebody else - who is doing (whatever).Â ?             Not necessarily. Sometimes the pronoun is used to impart a kind of solemnity to the utterance, as in Jesus's words as they appear in the Vulgate: 'Ego sum via, et veritas et vita'. This seems appropriate to the present case.

Can someone tell me whether a vessel which does not have sails can be described as 'sailing' between ports.   I know that 'sailing' is defined as 'motion across a body of water in a sailing ship, or smaller boat, powered by wind'.   What I want to know is which verb is used for vessels which do not have sails. ie. those powered by steam, electric, nuclear, oars, solar, etc etc.   I thank you in anticipation of your reply, and note that this will settle a debate!!!!   Thanks again.   M     Merriam-Websters defines the verb ""sail"" as ""to travel on water in a ship"", ""to travel on water by the action of wind upon sails or by other means"", ""to move or proceed easily, gracefully, nonchalantly, or without resistance"" and ""to begin a water voyage"". So yes you can use the word 'sailing' for non-sail powered ships. You could also use ""navigate"", ""cruise"", ""voyage"", or speak of ""a crossing"". People who sail on sailboats tend not to use the word 'sailing' to refer to sailing their boat without using the sails, but rather 'motoring'. -- BluePlatypus  01:30, 27 January 2006 (UTC)       Surprisingly, I helped answer a  RD question like this  before. The conclusion seems to have been that for large boats, sail is appropriate regardless of the actual fact of sails. Boat is better used for smaller ones.

(Granted, non-celebrities also give strange names to their kids, but I doubt at the same rate.) I saw a claim on an IMDb message board that some celebrities give their children weird names ( Moon Unit Zappa , anyone?) just to put on the birth certificate, and then call them a ""real name"" so they know who is just a hanger-on with ulterior motives, not a real friend (ie, they call them by the weird public name). My question is - is there any truth to this? Might celebrities who give their kids outlandish names call them by more ""normal"" names at home - in particular to insulate them from the tabloids/stalkers of the world?  165.123.152.196  02:47, 27 January 2006 (UTC)     Well, Moon Unit Zappa was and still is known as Moon Zappa, so that theory seems over before it's started. Some celebrity kids adopt their own, more-ordinary, names later in life, like Joe (a.k.a. Zowie) Bowie. No doubt some do do it for the reasons you say, but I don't think it's an overwhelming deliberate ploy. Note too that there are cultural differences, like ""lucky"" names. In the Philippines, parents will try to give their children unusual names so that they stand out from the crowd. In the west Indies and some parts of Africa, if the parents have the same surname as someone famous, they'll also give them the matching famous person's first name. Also, in the West Indies in particular, names that have long been out of fashion in the US and UK are still widely used. The old trend for African-Americans to use persidential surnames as first names is a similar phenomenon. Also note that there has been a widespread change in general to more unusual first names by many people in English speaking countries.

(not including the funeral costs) What happens when the family doesn't want to pay anything?     If a person has no family, the government will put the body in a pauper's grave. Speaking as a person who has had relatives die, most everyone wants some kind of religious service to help organize the parting of memories. Cremation is much cheaper than having a burial plot.  User:AlMac | (talk)  09:39, 27 January 2006 (UTC)       People whose body isn't claimed are given a ""pauper's funeral""; essentially, the local authorities pay for the individual to be buried as cheaply as possible. Though, apparently, some municipalities are switching to  cremation  because it's now fairly well accepted, and cheaper. The exception is in the case where a body is unidentified; they will bury it so that it can be retrieved for reburial if the next of kin are identified. -- Robert Merkel  09:38, 27 January 2006 (UTC)       The questioner specifically said  excluding funeral costs . I presume this means any fees to register the death, fill in forms, etc. Can't answer for the US, but in the UK all this was free, for the simple reason that they really want all deaths to be properly registered, rather than have bodies dumped in landfills or hidden in attics.  DJ Clayworth  16:37, 27 January 2006 (UTC)           To me, the funeral is just the ceremony held to commemorate the dead. Therefore the burial or cremation is not part of the funeral costs. My step-mom recently died at home, and the cost was about $1300 for body removal, cremation, paperwork, etc. It would have been $300 less if prearranged. That's in Detroit, and I suspect it's varies by location.  StuRat  17:03, 27 January 2006 (UTC)           [ edit ]   American Idol Judging   What qualifies Simon Cowell to Judge American singing?

Charles P._ (Mirv)  17:06, 27 January 2006 (UTC)     Yeah, and I use  Wikipedia:Tools/Navigation popups  for quick reverting.

Using the rollback is easier on the servers. -- Optichan  18:31, 27 January 2006 (UTC)    The admin version reverts all edits by the last user back to the next user in the history. It isn't the same as reverting to the previous edit. Of course sometimes a third user makes an edit between vandal edits and the admin tool only reverts back to that edit, leaving older vandalism.

IBM has one of the more sophisticated versions (costs more than the computer you put it on) in which you have to read a novel by Mark Twain aloud to the comptuer (takes a couple hours) so it learns how you pronounce words that are common in the English language. Even then, it figures out what words from context of those around (too two to sound the same but from context the computer figures out which you meant), but then if you are not good with the English language (not very literate), this is not going tow rork out very well. The state of art works for someone who can see the text and make corrections. It not do a good job yet for people who are blind and in real need of the technology.

Deuce: ""You mean space exploration is out of the question for you?""   Kate: ""I just don't think girls are meant to go all the way up there. Good luck to any girl who wants to be an astronaut.""   Kate: ""Frankly, I'd rather take it up the ass.""     That last line confused the shit out of me (no pun intended).

If she says ""Frankly,  I'd'  rather take it up the ass"" she may be referring to  pegging .           The way I read it is this. Kate does not want to go into space. In fact, so strongly does she not want to go into space that if it came to a choice between going into space and being sodomised, she would prefer being sodomised.   Presumably she considers sodomy to be an unpleasant experience, but when it comes to space travel, everything is relative.  JackofOz  12:56, 28 January 2006 (UTC)           [ edit ]   Science fiction   hey guys. i'm preparing a speech in public speaking class (imagine that) and i'm looking for examples of inventions/concepts/ideas found in science fiction/fantasy books that have modern-day parallels. for instance: the game played by the children in Orson Scott Card's book Ender's Game featured 'guns' that fired light beams, which then froze the suit of a given child, disabling him/her. the MILES system in use by the US Army is very similar, as it fires infrared light and sets off sensors worn by the soldiers to indicate a hit. any contributions would be appreciated. thanks, -- 66.82.9.42  22:00, 27 January 2006 (UTC)     Ooh, this is an interesting topic. Sadly, my brain has frozen, so let me think... Possibly my favourite is the  Future Force Warrior , a US Army project to create an extremely advanced future soldier with a powered exoskeleton, bearing a resemblence to Heinlein's  Mobile Infantry  in  Starship Troopers . I'm sure others can do much better.  Sum0  22:41, 27 January 2006 (UTC)           There are plenty (it's not the point of science fiction - although that's a different topic). The best known would probably be Arthur C. Clarke's suggestion of the use of communication satellites in one of his books. Another well-known example is the design of the communicators used in Star Trek, which are almost identical to modern cell-phones. Mobile phones themselves were first envisaged by  Robert A. Heinlein . Closed-circuit TV was shown in the 1930s movie  Metropolis . And  Hugo Gernsback 's 1920s novel ""Ralph 124C41+"" had dozens of things in it which have since become real items (though sadly the book is so dull as to be virtually unreadable). And one author (whose name sadly eludes me, although it was one of the biggies - Asimov, maybe?) was hauled before the US government authorities in the early 1940s for writing a novel featuring an atom bomb - at a time when top-secret research was going on to create the first one.  Grutness ... wha?  22:56, 27 January 2006 (UTC)                   You will probably get more and more through examples of this on the USENET group rec.arts.sf.written -- people ther love this kind of question. The author involved with teh ""atom bomb"" story, by the way, was Cleve Cartmill, then a major author but now rahter obscure. Asimov may have been influenced nby this incident in writing his story ""Pate de Fois Gras"".  DES   (talk)  23:06, 27 January 2006 (UTC)                   On the Cell-phone example, an earlier and more through anticipation is the 'Pocket phone' mentioend in the opening chapter of  Space Cadet  by Heinlein. Anotehr famed example is the antiapation of the internet itslf in ""A Logic named Joe"" by Murry Leinster. Yet another is the Waterbed, in Heinlein's "" Waldo "", although this was in turn anticipated for invalids in actual practice, as recorded by Mark Twain in ""A New Beecher Church"".  DES   (talk)  23:10, 27 January 2006 (UTC)               The Boys from Brazil  was one of the first sci-fi books to deal with  human cloning , back in 1976.  Sum0  23:43, 27 January 2006 (UTC)    Sorry it was alreasy so common as to be trite then.  The Duplicated Man'  dates from the early 1950s, as does the calssic ""Rogue Moon"", and there are many others. Niven's ""Organ Bank"" (Gil Hamilton) stories of the late 60s and 70s are also relevant.  DES   (talk)  00:12, 28 January 2006 (UTC)               I believe early episodes of  The Jetsons  featured a cooking device very much like a microwave oven. When that no longer seemed futuristic enough, they switched to dehydrated food.       Gattaca  featured genetic screening and engineering of humans.     StuRat  00:02, 28 January 2006 (UTC)         Both of these were featured in written SF in the early 1950s if not before. ""Radio cooking"" was IIRC used in several of the Heinlein ""juvies"" of that period. There are quite probably earlier examples yet. Cloning and genetic engineering were already stables of pre WWII written SF. Harrison's  Deathworld  series comnes to mind, and does Schmitz's ""Feederation fo the Hub"" (Telzy Amberson) series.  DES   (talk)  00:08, 28 January 2006 (UTC)           Above, Grutness suggested that ""the best known would probably be Arthur C. Clarke's suggestion of the use of communication satellites in one of his books."" Sorry, but this is a wrong example. Clarke did suggest the use of the  geostationary orbit  for communications satellites, but this was in a nonfiction article. Now let's see:    The  waldo  was conceived by  Robert A. Heinlein  in the story of that name.   Heinlein is also credited with conceiving the  waterbed ; follow the link.   During WW2, in "" Solution Unsatisfactory "", Heinlein conceived the idea of radioactive dust as a weapon of war: like the  dirty bomb  known today, minus the explosive used as a method of distribution.   Much earlier,  H.G. Wells  envisioned nuclear weapons in  The World Set Free . However, his atomic bombs were bombs that ""exploded continuously"" for days rather than bombs of great force.   Isaac Asimov , in the story "" The Feeling of Power "", imagined that calculators (or possibly even computers; it's not clear from the story how much power he imagined them having) would be reduced to pocket size. And then he went on to imagine that once this happened, simple arithmetic would become a forgotten art. We're getting there...   Murray Leinster  conceived something remarkably like the Internet as we know it today, and anticipated the issues of personal privacy and of censorship for underage users that we know with today's Net, in the story "" A Logic Named Joe "". This was written in 1946, before the word ""computer"" was even established in its modern meaning; ""a logic"" in the title means a computer.   In  John Brunner 's 1975 novel  The Shockwave Rider , a ""worm"" or ""tapeworm"" is a computer program that propagates autonomously in a network.   Finally, a throwaway joke: during the production of the movie  A Space Odyssey , Clarke commented that the publicity department at  MGM  must have typewriters where the press of a single key would produce the phrase ""Never before, in the history of science fiction"". Our younger readers may need to be reminded that on an actual  typewriter  as they then existed, the press of one key produced one character.   (On rereading the other parts, I see that I've mentioned a couple of items that were already given. Sorry about that; I'll leave them in anyway for the sake of the links.) --Anonymous, 01:45 UTC, January 28, 2006.       Good list. Of course, while Clarke's proposal of geostationary communications sats was non-fiction, he showed some of the possible consequences of easy global communications in ""I remember Babylon"".  DES   (talk)  01:56, 28 January 2006 (UTC)    true of course - I was going from my (frequently faulty) memory. Still, I think that's a pretty reasonable list we've assembled overall...  Grutness ... wha?  02:51, 28 January 2006 (UTC)                       many thanks are in order. a fantastic list, guys. i really appreciate it. -- 66.82.9.42  03:15, 28 January 2006 (UTC)                   I'm a little late to the party, but the author who wrote about the atomic bomb shortly before it was used (and got into trouble with the FBI) was  Cleve Cartmill . -- Fastfission  05:13, 28 January 2006 (UTC)       Nanotechnology  is just taking off today, with many companies in many nations scrambling to get involved. The idea was first described in Science Fiction in the 1960's in novels by Stephen Baxter and Paul McAuley. They were talking about using it in the area of biology. In real life so far it has only been used in manufacturing.   When did the equal rights for women  feminism  movement begin to take off? Was it given a helping hand, or prediction in Science Fiction? Consider Ursula Le Guin's[ Left Hand of Darkness] (1969); Margaret Atwood's  The Handmaid's Tale  (1985). movies like Alien, where women played strong roles, and in  Star Trek , where people other than white males had strong roles and equality, first coming out at a time when there was vast discrimination and prejudice in the real world.   Protecting  Ecology  and the  environment , and understanding this aspect of our planet, are concepts first explored by science fiction, such as Frank Herbert's  Dune  (1965) and other stories; George Stewart's  Earth Abides  (1949); Hal Clement's  Mission of Gravity  (1954),   Dystopia  is the concept of a society or community gone wrong. Science Fiction shows us how humans can screw up big time with technology, providing us with inspiration how to prevent it from happening, or watch the horrible stuff unfold, like George Orwwll's Nineteen Eight Four (1949). In the name of protecting the innocent from terrorism, we are headed towards a society in which the state has the power to know everything we do.   Cybercrime  has not been well predicted by SF, but look at all the  Robot  detective stories. Here we have expectations of intelligent behavior by machines. Real robots today are mainly used in manufacturing, and do not resemble the stories by Asimov and other giants, but consider the plots of the robot stories, then consider how much trouble we now have from  malware . I see parallels.   Biotechnology  has been big business in recent decades, perhaps partially due to discoveries by the human  genome  project mapping out human  DNA  to the point that scientists are now able to design new life forms to perform specific tasks, such as environmental cleanup. Science Fiction first considered  genetic engineering ,  cloning ,  biological warfare , body augmentation, and similar concepts in novels like H.G.Wells  The Island of Dr Moreau  (1896}; Aldous Huxley's  Brave New World  (1932); Frederick Pohl's  Man Plus  (1976); and others could be mentioned.    How erecently have we had  cloning  for real? A decade or so. Michael Crichton's  Jurassic Park  (1990) probably catapulted the concept into the public consousness, with the movie having more success than  The Boys from Brazil , but the topic was also found in SF in other novels such as Kate Wilhelm's  Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang  (1975) and Gene Wolfe's  The Fifth Head of Cerberus  (1972).

How do i crop an oversized website or image for printing on a piece of standard A4 size paper...???     First off, you must be referring to an individual web page, as a web site may consist of hundreds of pages, and I doubt if you would want to print all of it. Next, cropping might be a poor choice, as typically scaling down the image to fit the paper is a better choice. However, if you're sure you want to trim it, then you could do a screen grab, paste it into a software product like Microsoft Paint, then use that product to crop the image. I'm assuming you have a windows PC here. If you can't get the entire web page on the screen at once, even under max resolution, then this method would require that you use the Print Screen button one section at a time, which would be quite time consuming. Perhaps someone else has a better solution for this case.  StuRat  02:20, 28 January 2006 (UTC)       A webpage should resize to fit whichever size paper you print to, just as it adapts to the size of the browser window you view it in. Unless there is some element that doesn't resize, such as an image, so I suppose that is what you mean (as with some images here on Wikipedia image pages, such as this nice one by me:  [65] ). I'll assume you're viewing the page 'live' on the Internet. I don't know if there is an easier solution (there should be), but what you could do is download the page (Ctrl-S) and the image (right-click it and select 'download image') to the same directory. Then open the downloaded page in a text editor (not a browser) and look for  <img src="" [photo-file] "" . This will, however, be the image on the site. Change [photo-file] to simply the filename on your computer (if it's in the same dir - else you'll have to specify the path, absolute or relative, but that would unnecessarily complicate this). You should put that between the quotes - the complete name, with the jpg (or whichever) extension. Now you should be able to view it offline, with the image intact. Then, open the image in an image editor and resize it. You speak of cropping, but that is removing bits of the edges of the image, but I suppose you mean resize - keeping the complete image but making it smaller (reducing the amount of pixels), so look for that term in whichever image editing program you use.   Addition: if you just want to print the image (not the whole page), it's better to do that with the printing software (something like 'fit to page'). The image editor will also have an option to reduce the amount of cm's (or inches, whichever the program uses). Note that this does not alter the image itself, whereas the former solution (reducing the amount of pixels)  does . It just changes a 'tag' attached to the image that will tell any printing application which size to print it in. But, as I said, you should be able to override that with the printing software.

I'm writing to see if you can give me any legal advice as to how to proceed with an American citizen from NY who is infecting women with HIV intentionally leaving the condom inside them soon after starting the sexual act and then ejaculating inside them.Our legal system is terrible, and I wanted to know if it is possible to charge him under American laws even though he is doing this here.   Thank you,   Andrea Bruno -- 200.114.173.43  02:09, 28 January 2006 (UTC)     No, I don't think so. In general, any crime committed by an American outside US territory is considered to be outside the jurisdiction of US courts. I know of one exception: Adults who travel to foreign countries to have sex with children may be charged in US courts, regardless of the legality of those acts in that country.       However, why can't you just charge the person with attempted murder in ArgentinaÂ ? I don't see why a special law would be needed for this case.       StuRat  02:30, 28 January 2006 (UTC)           The other piece of good news is that the risk of a single unprotected sexual encounter with a person with HIV is not as high as you might think, according to our  AIDS  article, particularly absent risk factors like a preexisting infection with another sexually transmitted disease. So, while this certainly doesn't excuse this individual's alleged disgusting behaviour, with a bit of luck he may not have actually infected anybody. StuRat is right, though; it should theoretically be a crime under Argentinian law. One option that might be possible if criminal conviction is impossible, but you have  convincing  evidence of his behaviour, is to bring it to the attention of the immigration authorities. Visas can generally be revoked on ""character"" grounds even in the absence of a specific criminal offence. -- Robert Merkel  11:57, 28 January 2006 (UTC)           First make sure the person is reported to the police as soon as possible. The longer one waits with this the less chance there is of revealing useful evidence. Someone cannot be convicted without a police investigation. -  Mgm | (talk)  15:56, 28 January 2006 (UTC)       [ edit ]   Other languages   In norwegian all new content in articles which administrators diagree about (typical philisophical or political) is removed by the administrators (not normal users!) and writer is banned for noe valid reason. They do never discuss the matter and explicit disagree with this principle:   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Resolving_disputes  - When someone makes an edit you consider biased or inaccurate, improve the edit, rather than reverting it.   In Norwegian version everybody has to agree that socialist point of view is the only truth and if anybody write or insert a link that does not support socialist theory, they are usually censored/banned. Why do english version of wikipedia link to the Norwegian when the principles of how to write articles are opposite of the english version? The principle above should be a must for all language versions - else they should not be linked to. There is no point linking to a left-hand propaganda machinery which is strongly biased to classic socialist point of view. Who agree with this?   Norwegian version is NOT a norwegian version of the english but a propaganda machinery for the socialist way of thinking.     Which Norwegian wikipedia,  no  or  nn ? I'm not sure how to deal with this as I don't speak Norwegian. Perhaps it's best to contact  Wikimedia , the parent of all the Wikipedias. -- Sum0  10:32, 28 January 2006 (UTC)           He is talking about the  bokml  version. He is most likely talking about the article about  capitalism , which he keeps saying it's just the socialists point of view, and using offensive language to other administrators and users. He is, by the way, the only with his point of view. ~  Mathias-S  11:02, 28 January 2006 (UTC) ( no )               It might be usefull to add that according to him the only party in Norway which is pro capitalism is a party that got all of 213 votes (0.0%) at the elections in 2005. The rest are social democrats or worse. There is currently a discussion on how to treat bad language about other users.  Haros  11:12, 28 January 2006 (UTC)                   I wonder if something like this could happen at all. If only admins could vote for new admins, it could if the first few are of a certain political (or whatever) opinion and conspire in such a malevolent way. But they're chosen by any user who wishes to vote, so this sounds like a very unlikely scenario.  DirkvdM  12:57, 28 January 2006 (UTC)                           I am not an admin myself at the  Norwegian Wikipedia , but I can confirm what you say, DirkvdM. The user posting this is most likely the (one of the) only user(s) with that thought. The Norwegian (bokml) Wikipedia is a normal Wikipedia, just as all the others.

I have been to some hobby conventions, where people reserved hotel rooms, drove hundreds of miles, then when they tried to check into the hotel, the front desk refused to honor the reservations because the attendees were too young.  User:AlMac | (talk)  09:19, 28 January 2006 (UTC)           So, if there is any doubt (say if you're under 21), ask when you make the reservation.  StuRat  11:30, 28 January 2006 (UTC)                   Never thought such a thing might happen. But a backpacker's wouldn't turn kids away. Unless they're really young, maybe, but I've done a lot of travelling and never heard of this happening. Then again, it might be different in the US. Or is there something special about Houston?  DirkvdM  13:01, 28 January 2006 (UTC)                           Part of what's different is we don't know what ""a backpacker's"" is. Maybe a  hostel ? But we have few of those.  Rmhermen  13:48, 28 January 2006 (UTC)                                   Yeah, it's a hostel. I made a redirect there now since among backpackers it's a very common term because the word 'hostel is too easily associated with  youth hostels  (the biggest yuk there is in travelling, apart from a few notable exceptions, escpecially outside cities).  DirkvdM  14:28, 28 January 2006 (UTC)                                       I see you edited the  hostel  article just before I did. You might have another lok at that and  youth hostel , both of which I have altered to clarify this.  DirkvdM  18:33, 28 January 2006 (UTC)                       When I last went to Houston, I stayed in Bed and Breakfast ... watch out ... I was attending a convention at some hotels that cost hundreds of dollars a night, so I thought I was getting a bargain @ much lesss than $ 100.00 a night which they said was a short drive from the convention center. Yah Right ... 45 minute drive depending on traffic. It was much better in Chicago. Downtown Bed & Breakfast, free parking, $ 50.00 a nite, 2 blocks walk from the convention. The last hobby convention I remember being at, where I witnessed people being turned away who had reservations but the hotel desk clerk thought were too young was in St Louis.  User:AlMac | (talk)  22:24, 28 January 2006 (UTC)     Off-topic but I had to get this off my chest. In the UK, it's illegal for people under 18 to buy or sell cigarettes. So guess who my local supermarket (Tesco's) put on the cigarette counter today? Thats right, a 17 year-old. So for every single customer, she has to ring for the supervisor to OK the sale. Aaargh.  Jameswilson  00:08, 29 January 2006 (UTC)     That's as bad as the ""answering services"" that say, ""Hello, this is Uranus-Hertz Corp, may I help youÂ ?""...My answer is, ""I seriously doubt it, as you know nothing about the business you are misrepresenting as your employer"". If you think you have reached a live receptionist actually at the company, it can be quite baffling: ""What are your hoursÂ ?"" ""I don't know."", ""Where are you locatedÂ ?"" ""I don't know."" ""What products or services do you offerÂ ?"" ""I don't know.""  StuRat  08:38, 29 January 2006 (UTC)           This is getting terribly off track, but I thought I'd add: for some years my company has purchased out of hours call answering from a call centre in the UK. (They e-mail us the messages they take). You sit down with them and work out a script, and give them information they can look up, but we could not persuade them, as I wanted, to actually say in their opening that they are the ""answering service for XXX"". I don't know if they consider that unprofessional.  Notinasnaid  11:18, 29 January 2006 (UTC)                   Yea, they are inherently dishonest, trying to pass themselves off as receptionists at a company, when they are not. To me, this is just lying. I have the same problem when I call AOL for help, and get some call center in India where they don't know the first thing about AOL, so how are they going to help meÂ ? Short answer, they don't, they just misdirect me to the wrong phone number for an inappropriate department which no longer exists, then hang up on me during the transfer.

KILO - LIMA  16:12, 28 January 2006 (UTC)   Yes, but most of the time i use itunes     It's almost a certainty that Microsoft's  MSN Messenger  is setup only to integrate with Microsoft's  Windows Media Player  only. In order to display what track you're listening to, the two programs have to talk to each other via an  application programming interface , and most large software vendors (like Microsoft) have a bad habit of not 'playing well' with other vendors (like Apple iTunes). You might be able to find another  instant messenger  client program which can work on the MSN network, and is also able to display the track from any media player. I'm not up on the technology there, but you might look into some of the clients at  instant messenger#Cooperation .

Go to the school's website and look at their admission requirements. Don't mess around trying to meet them. Also ask your school's guidance counsellor, that's actually their specialty. Other than that I would say to be well rounded, do some extra-curriculars, take an interest in your community and have a fun childhood! It's over before you know it! Oh yeah, it's always a bonus to apply early, get all your papers in order, and work on your written and public communication. Don't worry.

Be aware, though, that it will be much more expensive for you to study overseas (where you'll have to pay the full course fees unless you get a scholarship) than it will be studying at home in Australia. Another option you can think about is doing a student exchange while you're at university, where you spend a year studying at an overseas university and the balance in your home country.               Finally, the UK is an expensive place for Australians to study, but a lucractive place to work, because both costs and wages are higher in the UK. Maybe you consider working there for a time before or after you finish your degree. -- Robert Merkel  11:22, 28 January 2006 (UTC)         How does working help? Not in a rude way, lol, just in an interested way, also how old do you have to be to apply at universities?     Working helps by providing you with money, which you can exchange for food at  shops . I don't think there's a minimum age- every so often an obnoxious 13-year-old goes to Oxford to study maths, so if there are rules they can certainly be waived. Many Scottish children go to university at the age of 17, though earlier than that would be unusual.  Mark 1  13:48, 28 January 2006 (UTC)           The underage applications to Oxford are, I believe, likely to stop in the next year or so. If memory serves, recent child protection laws would mean that everyone resident in the college would have to pass a background check, and with several hundred undergraduates plus staff, the cost alone of processing this paperwork would be unsupportable.  Shimgray  |  talk  | 14:32, 28 January 2006 (UTC)           Depends on what your motivation for studying in the UK is. If it's because of a belief that universities in the UK are better than Australia's, well, that very much depends on the course you do and the university you attend. Taking the university as a whole (always a dangerous thing to do), Oxford and Cambdridge are better than any university in Australia, but I'd say that ANU, the University of Melbourne, and (arguably) the University of Sydney are the equal of just about anywhere else in the UK, and superior to many. If it's because you want the experience of living in the UK, getting a degree there may not be the most cost-effective way to do it. -- Robert Merkel  00:07, 29 January 2006 (UTC)       [ edit ]   Previous questions   How do I find previous questions that I asked which arn't in the list anymore?

Since I have never seen a U.S. college/university with a closed quad, I wonder if this is true. Do any U.S. colleges have porters and/or lodge? The article  Porter (college)  makes no mention of non-UK porters in its very short text.  Rmhermen  17:19, 28 January 2006 (UTC)     I have never heard those terms used in any of the various colleges in Northeast Ohio, but the colleges all do have positions that perform those functions. I can scarcely imagine any large organization that could get by without doing those things. - LambaJan  23:37, 28 January 2006 (UTC)           It may also be worth noting that porters' lodges exist outside colleges with closed quads - there aren't closed quads at Durham, for example (at least, not in most colleges), it being a very Oxbridge bit of architecture. The term is often used elswhere, though they're often not quite as high-profile as in residential colleges.  Shimgray  |  talk  | 22:10, 30 January 2006 (UTC)                   Indeed, they exist outside colleges. My school, for example, has a porters lodge, with an open quadrangle.  Sam Korn   (smoddy)  22:14, 30 January 2006 (UTC)             The same function may be served in the US by a security booth, typically at the entrance to parking areas, or an information desk/receptionist's desk, typically by the main entrance to a building.

Pacific Coast Highway | Leave a message ($.25)  23:25, 28 January 2006 (UTC)                   There is a particular technique called  voice compression , where they take out all the silent bits, along with  audio level compression  used to ensure the volume never drops below a certain level on what would have been quieter, but not silent, parts. The maximum volume is still the same, but the effect is that it sounds louder.  StuRat  14:59, 29 January 2006 (UTC)               Yes, that is the reason. Lately several radio stations have started putting background music behind the announcer for this very reason. It's to keep the audience engaged, annoyed, and sometimes entertained.       What you noticed is really among the most innocuous of the ratings tactics. The ones to really be careful about are related to the choice of stories and the way that they're presented.

User:AlMac | (talk)  04:40, 29 January 2006 (UTC)   Years ago, the newsroom would be abuzz with the sound of teletype machines bringing in the latest news from the news wires, like UPI and AP. This sound became a mental trigger that you were watching live news, versus prerecorded ""old news"" (do I get an oxymoron badge for using that termÂ ?). Modern newsrooms aren't so loud, as quieter printers and the availability of information online made the teletype obsolete. However, some news orgs still try to replicate the ""live news"" effect with a similar beat. Another method used is to have the background filled with reporters and other workers typing on computers, talking on phones, etc., instead of placing a nice set behind the anchors.  StuRat  08:15, 29 January 2006 (UTC)     For years my parents and others of their generation have been complaining about the tendency to add background music to factual content. They complain that it is very hard to pick out the words, and I find that as I get into my 40s this is becoming noticeable to me too. Arguably this is counter-productive, though it depends on the target audience. It may be that the original questioner (who I suspect was lost and won't be back, but please prove us wrong if you are here) has poor hearing and can maybe only hear the drum component of the background music, and muffled speech. Fortunately, at least in the UK, some channels offer subtitles. This can be of help.

Such as ""Chicken Meal"", ""Lamb Meal"", etc. I believe that it is ground meat, but it is not considered to be as nutritous for your pet compared to PIECES of chicken.   How are the two different besides being ground? Wouldn't they be considered the same nutritionally, except one is whole pieces and the other is ground? How does grinding it change the nutritional value?   I am researching dog food so I can share this information with my colleagues and find out what food it truly the most healty. I sincerely appreciate your help! Thank you.     Top 10 Things You Don't Want to Know ... What goes into anything called 'Chicken Meal' or Chicken Loaf. -- Zeizmic  00:14, 29 January 2006 (UTC)       Apparently ""meal"" is defined by the  Association of American Feed Control Officials  (AAFCO). ""Chicken meal"" is:           The dry rendered product from a combination of clean flesh and skin with or without accompanying bone, derived from the parts of whole carcasses of chicken, exclusive of feathers, heads, feet, or entrails.   [67]           The main difference between meal and pieces of meat seems to be that meal may contain an uncertain amount of ground  bone , thus containing less  protein  than whole meat. Meal may also come from a variety of sources that may be less than healthful.           The dead animal might not be rendered until days after its death. Therefore the carcass is often contaminated with  bacteria  such as  Salmonella .  E. Coli  bacteria are estimated to contaminate more than 50% of meat meals. While the cooking process may kill bacteria, it does not eliminate the endotoxins some bacteria produce during their growth and are released when they die. These  toxins  can cause sickness and disease.  Pet food  manufacturers do not test their products for endotoxins.   [68]           Hope that helps.      01:36, 29 January 2006 (UTC)     Didn't I say? -- Don't ask!Â :) -- Zeizmic  02:06, 29 January 2006 (UTC)     See also the external links from our  dog food  article. -- Shantavira  09:27, 29 January 2006 (UTC)       [ edit ]   January 29     [ edit ]   sodomy   Can someone explain the exact origin of the word ""sodomy""?     The word refers to an act between people that was ascribed to the inhabitants of the city of Sodom, as vaguely suggested in the Biblical book of  Genesis . The English usage of this word for this act, however, is not biblical but can be traced back at least to the 13th century according to the OED.  alteripse  02:54, 29 January 2006 (UTC)       Well, according to the  Oxford English Dictionary  it comes from the  Old French   sodomie . That comes from the famous old Biblical city,  Sodom , which is from the Hebrew , origin of the word in many European languages (possibly also in the Qu'ran?). Despite this etymology, as our article on  sodomy  mentions, the word has a varied history and has not always been used to mean ""male/male sex"" as it is today. -- George  03:03, 29 January 2006 (UTC)           Actually, it may mean many different types of sex even today, such as homosexual anal sex, heterosexual anal sex, or, more rarely, homosexual or heterosexual oral sex, bestiality, or anything anyone considers ""unnatural"".

Please see  Unidentified flying object . --  Rick Block   ( talk )  05:46, 29 January 2006 (UTC)     I sure hope not.     Of course they do. Whenever you see something in the air and you can't make out what it is, it's an  U nidentified  F lying  O bject. A more interesting question would be if  extraterrestrial life  exists.  Keenan Pepper  07:42, 29 January 2006 (UTC)           I once saw a film in which a pilot saw something flying through the air he couldn't make out and reported that. Upon the question ""Do you want to report a UFO?"" he frowned and after some hesitation said ""no"". But of course he  had  spotted a UFO. Funny how words can get a completely unrelated meaning.  DirkvdM  09:52, 29 January 2006 (UTC)                   That an object is unidentified by some person and flying does not make it a UFO. ""UFO"" has acquired a meaning distinct from its origins. In the sense of ""extraterrestrial spacecraft visiting Earth"", no, they don't exist. There are almost certainly extraterrestrial spacecraft  somewhere , but not near Earth.  Mark 1  14:00, 29 January 2006 (UTC)            If an object is unidentified and flying, it's an Unidentified Flying Object (aka UFO) by definition. Whether it's extraterrestrial (which is the meaning some people erronously give it) is another matter. But strictly speaking that was not the question. -  Mgm | (talk)  10:09, 30 January 2006 (UTC)           I agree with the first part, Mark. In relation to the latter, I'd say that there's no scientifically accepted evidence of any connection between UFOs and extraterrestrials. If you postulate that extraterrestrials and their spacecraft exist somewhere (presumably because you think it would be logically impossible for them not to exist, somewhere), it's a bit of a stretch to state with certainty that they can be nowhere near Earth.  JackofOz  14:18, 29 January 2006 (UTC)                                   When you consider the huge number of stars in the universe, and presumably planets, it is possible to be, say 99.9% sure there are aliens somewhere but also, say, 99.9% sure they never visited here. A similar example would be that I can be 99.9% sure there is a grain of sand on a beach somewhere consisting mainly of uranium, but can also be 99.9% sure that is not true of a random sand grain I pick up.

I just hope you don't do that here 99.9% of the time.   Mark, that 99.9% of the people use a word in a certain way does not mean that they're right. Truth is not a matter of democracy.

However, an acronym can't mean anything besides what is stands for, as far as I'm concerend, so I agree in this case.  StuRat  19:02, 29 January 2006 (UTC)    Oh, no no no.

So of course that means any earth launched satellite could be by definition extraterrestrial,  CambridgeBayWeather   (Talk)  19:19, 29 January 2006 (UTC)     If intelligent aliens, other than those humans who cross national boundaries of planet  Earth , visit us from outside of planet Earth, such as from the outer space being studied by  SETI ,  time travelers , or some  cross time universe  speculated about by  science fiction , I would expect them to use pretty good  stealth  technology, compared to what we have developed.

As to Shift, that goes back to  typewriters . On most typewriters each typebar has a pair of characters, such as ""S"" and ""s"", only one of which is so aligned that it will actually be typed when the corresponding key is hit. The shift key physically shifts either the platen (roller) or the basket of type bars upward by a few millimeters so that the other one of the two characters will be typed. --Anonymous, 07:17 UTC, January 29.

DirkvdM  10:00, 29 January 2006 (UTC)           'Alt' means 'alternate'; that nugget of info is in the  AltGr key  article.

Some think this belief about the ""post-1914 world"" is just pessismistic, or that it is caused by the media keeping on talking about bad news.But those Christians seem to think that way for religious reasons.I don't know why, but read Matthew Chapter 24,Mark Chapter 13, and Luke Chapter 17 vs.20-37 of the Bible. If you don't know the answers to these questions, then please ask others about it.You should write a letter to you church(if you go to one),you local government,your national government, or even the United Nations about this subject.

Who really wants to eat an unprepared cake mix?     The nutritional information is only for what is in the package. They can't control if you use low-fat milk or whole milk in your cereal, for instance.  Rmhermen  04:43, 30 January 2006 (UTC)     I mean, On these boxes, there are 2 columns of nutritional information. For Example, on a cake mix. one column has the nutritional information in a unprepared state (as in right out of the box) and ther other column has the information in the prepared version (as in fully baked). Why would they list the information in an unprepared state? Who would want to eat it that way?         Like what Rmhermen said, they can't control what you use it for so they put the info on there for just what is in the box itself. For instance, pancake mix can be used for different things and not just pancakes. So they give you the info for what's in the box and it's up to you, if you really want to know, to get the nutritional info on whatever else you put in.  Dismas | (talk)  09:34, 30 January 2006 (UTC)           And of course, if you overcook, or bake too long you might lose nutrients, for which they cannot account in advance. -  Mgm | (talk)  10:14, 30 January 2006 (UTC)     Nobody is getting this. The prepared state nutritional information is differnt from the unprepared state. The Prepared state information contains the information for if you FOLLOWED the directions. It's differnt in that way.     I think the others who answered this question were wholly aware that the prepared nutritional information was differnt from the unprepared nutritional information. The answers they provided for this difference seemed fair and logical to me.   It might help to think of this in terms of lagalities. The unprepared version is what the company is required by law to provide. The prepared version is a guide for the shoppers convenience. - LambaJan  21:44, 30 January 2006 (UTC)     So tell me then...Who and why would someone eat raw cake mix or unpopped popcorn?     because they want to?? - LambaJan  03:12, 31 January 2006 (UTC)       [ edit ]   Puree Berries, why do they stink?   Hi, I am a chocolatier, and every time that I puree berries, specifically raspberry and stawberry, I am taken back by their horrible smell? I have searched and searched and cannot find out why they smell when pureed?    Please please tell me, when I puree berries, why do they smell like poop?   Thank you very much, Jennifer in Austin     I can't recall ever having this problem. Are you pureing them them by themselves and adding them to the chocolate later? And I can safely assume you're using fresh washed berries. Correct? - LambaJan  21:48, 30 January 2006 (UTC)       Ok, I looked it up, and assuming you're taking care of all of the obvious things... Both of those types of berries are acidic and sweet- a deadly combination. The delicate flavors arise mainly from certain chemical compounds and naturally occuring enzymes. Even in cold storage these fruits start to break down rapidly and go through many changes before they become bad or reach a point where humans decide it's best to throw them out.    ""Pureeing mixes the cell contents with eachother and with oxygen in the air, so enzyme action and oxidation begin immediately... The best way to minimize this change is to chill the puree, which slows all chemical reactions.""  (Harold McGee - On Food and Cooking (the best food book ever))       Strawberries and rasberries both freeze well, and that's usually how I buy them. You're probably spoiled with fresh ones all year in Austin. My advice is to freeze them as soon as you get them, use them soon anyway, and puree them while they're still frozen. - LambaJan  04:43, 1 February 2006 (UTC)       [ edit ]   Australian Height   What is the average height for Australian men and women? -- Ali K  04:58, 30 January 2006 (UTC)     See  Average height .

In arcade fps games about wars, the weapons don't do many damage on soldier (because the damage is low, or the defence of the soldier is high), they have many bullets.... . Many players in this wars act like rambo when playing. There are some realistic fps war games the don't have this.   In every war the weapons of the soldiers gets better, and the armor too. So my strange questions is what was the most arcadish war [don't need to be a veeeeeeery famous war (need to be a war with firearms)]??     The most arcadish FPS i have played is  Command & Conquer: Renegade   Â  Run! Â   09:36, 30 January 2006 (UTC)       I would hesitate to characterize any war as ""arcadeish""; the sense of self-preservation occuring in war just isn't duplicated in a video game. You might, however, find specific incidents: many people would consider  Alvin York 's virtually unassisted capture of a German company in  World War I  to be the stuff of video games.   Lomn   Talk  14:23, 30 January 2006 (UTC)     run! i was talking what was the most arcade war, not game. I will make another question, if the game developers was making very realistic fps games for every firearm war, what game would be the most arcade game? (If anyone game will be arcade, what game will be the least non-arcade game)     To my knowledge, the most realistic war (first person shooter) game for PC is Counter-Strike. I don't know about arcade, though. - LambaJan  21:51, 30 January 2006 (UTC)     I don't know the answer of the question, but counter strike isn't the most realistic FPS game of the world (he is a very arcade game), the most realistic fps is VBS1 or virtual battlefield system and is used to train soldiers, but you can use as a game.

Then you go to a regular map of various nations that shows how many feet various places are above sea level to find out which coastal cities of which nations are likely to follow the example of  New Orleans  if efforts are not taken to raise the level of the land on which new buildings get placed.  User:AlMac | (talk)  08:46, 31 January 2006 (UTC)           There's not just the question of how high land is above or below (!) sea level. It's also a matter of protection. About half of the Netherlands is below sea level, but protected by dykes (no, StuRat, we've already heard that jokeÂ :) ). So is Death Valley in the US, but that's procted by coastal mountain ranges. And a large area North of the Caspian Sea, but that's well away from any seas. And New Orleans, of course, and that wasn't protected well enough. For a more complete list (though I don't know how complete it is) see  List of places on land with elevations below sea level . We've got a list on everything, don't we? But then do we have a list like the one asked for? We should have, I suppose, but I can't find it. Mind you, there are other factors at work. It's not just the average sea level rise but also the heating of the sea, which will cause more hurricanes (such as the one that swamped New Orleans). Such a storm combined with high tide or even spring tide (such as during the  North Sea flood of 1953 ) will aggravate things even more. And a straightened and smoothed river (for the benefit of shipping) can cause a surging sea to reach further inland. And don't forget the increased rainfall we can expect. The water threat doesn't come just from the sea, but also from the rivers. All these factors (except hurricanes) are at play in the Netherlands, so people around here should be a little more worried than they are.

However, apart from that it shouldn't be a major problem if they indeed are nobles as you say. That usually means a well-documented family history.

Do you have to re-site that source each time you use further information from it? Or is one citation enough per paragraph?   -- Shadarian  22:42, 30 January 2006 (UTC)     What do you mean by citing? Do you mean a paranthetical reference to the book and page number (or whatver) that you are citing, or do you mean referencing the author/work? You probably only need to use the paranthetical reference once, but if citing a source more than once, you should make it clear within your text that you are citing the same source.  204.108.96.18  23:43, 30 January 2006 (UTC)       I'd say that depends on whether you have other citations in-between or not. E.g.  ""The ball has been observed to be round (Abel, 2005), as well as heavy (Baker, 2006). Further, it has been suggested that it may be composed of granite."" . Now it's not clear where that last proposition came from, so a citation is needed. Although in this case you'd probably do better to group the opinions by source. This also varies of course with what you're writing. If it's a scientific paper, you need to back up every single nontrivial statement, but in other cases you may be able to take greater liberties. You can also go overboard with too many citations, I've seen a scientific paper with 40 citations in the first paragraph, which is just ridiculous. -- BluePlatypus  00:02, 31 January 2006 (UTC)     That makes sense. Thanks. -- Shadarian  00:46, 31 January 2006 (UTC)     Also, one approach that many people use in the humanities is to cite at the end of a paragraph which contains only information from one souce. That is, if you use one book to write a whole paragraph (or even a short section), a single citation should suffice in making it clear where the information comes from. Remember the goal of citation is to answer the question, ""Where's he getting this information from?"" If that is clear then the exact formalities of it are less important. And if it is something that nobody is going to ask (i.e. ""The White House is white"" will not provoke such a suspicious question), then it probably doesn't need to be cited at all. -- Fastfission  15:21, 31 January 2006 (UTC)       [ edit ]   Super Bowl XL   I agree that The Steelers might be a dangerous, but with Pittsburg being favored, Why aren't the Seahawks getting any credit?     Credit for what? They got to the Super Bowl, what else do they need credit for?  Dismas | (talk)  23:11, 30 January 2006 (UTC)    It's because, although Seattle is good on every front, the teams they beat to get to the Superbowl, although very good, were not as good as the teams Pittsburg beat to get there. Pittsburg already beat the two teams that were favored to get to and win the Superbowl earlier in the season.   Also, Seattle's beating Carolina was largely due to their shutting down Smith. Without him available the Panther's offense fell apart. If they try that same tactic and shut down Bettis, then they still have to contend with Ward and Rothlisberger. And Pittsburg has more recent playoff experience and are geographically closer to the playing field.   It's entirely possible that Seattle can make the correct adjustments to come through for a win. They are good enough, but the circumstances seem to be favoring Pittsburg. Besides, Seattle is getting credit. They have the league MVP and a nice trophy to boot. - LambaJan  03:33, 31 January 2006 (UTC)           [ edit ]   Sandbox   Has anybody else noticed that, among the interlanguage links on the  Wikipedia:Sandbox  page, the Hebrew and Finnish links are not to the testing page but rather to  Sandbox ?

It's not because I believe in these things, because I don't. Yet every time I hear/read about ghost ""sightings"", ""alien abductions"", etc, I get afraid to leave my bedroom at night. Any advice? I'm not willing to seek professional help or spend any money on this.  Bowlhover  02:13, 31 January 2006 (UTC)     Well, if this is actually getting in the way of your life, you really should seek more professional help than the Reference desk offers. However, if it's just an annoyance, I suggest you pick up a copy of  Michael Shermer 's  Why People Believe Weird Things . Even if you didn't have a phobia, it's a great read. (Oh, yeah, and are you sure it's ""lithophobia""? A Google search defined lithophobia as the fear of rocks.)  Deltabeignet  02:56, 31 January 2006 (UTC)       Those are all things that are outside your realm of control. They're big question marks. ""Do they even exist? What if they do? What will they do to me?"" You may want to ask yourself what else you're afraid of. The future? I'm not a psychologist, but I do know that researchers have found that the best way to get over most fears is to learn about the thing you're afraid of. Arachnids? Read an article about them and you'll be set. People of other cultures? Go to the import stores or wherever else they are and meet them. You'll like most of them.   Of course there is very little scientific data to comfort you on these things. I can tell you that I'm comforted by my religous beliefs on this subject, though this is no place to share them. The important thing, in my opinion, is to try to understand what is most likely at the source of this fear. My guess is you're between the ages of 15 and 30, with a lot of pressure and uncertanty about how things will work out for you. If that's the case then go relax at the beach, meet up with some friends, and listen to some music. But only after taking care of your obligations, otherwise you're just pretending to relax. And don't sue me if you take my advice and it doesn't work out for you. I'm not a psychologist. - LambaJan  03:56, 31 January 2006 (UTC)           I think you probably meant to say ""lygophobia"".

I have lots of fears (just like everyone), but I have an  irrational  fear of the dark and of heights (though I'm not afraid to look down from the CN Tower). My fear of the dark is really no more than an annoyance that haunts me at night but doesn't affect me during the day. I'm actually a skeptic who believes ghosts are no more than a fantasy. Aliens do exist, but they aren't visiting Earth or my bedroom or anything like that. Scary television shows, including fictional ones, are the source of my fear. Unlike most people, my fear of the dark developed when I was 8, and was totally nonexistant before that time. By the way, I'm a nerd who hates music and has only one friend.Â :( ----  Bowlhover  17:09, 31 January 2006 (UTC)                           I used to get this sort of thing; I found that walking sideways, with my back against the wall, helped me feel more secure until I got over it.

I don't believe in aliens, but sometimes I get anxious that I'll experience a horror movie clich, like suddenly seeing an alien's head when lightning flashes, or looking into a dark corner and noticing one. The best advice I can offer is to take deep breaths, or alter your sleeping pattern so you're going to bed at 9pm and waking up at 6.               For me, when I fear of the darkness and silence or strange sounds in the night, turning on the radio can often help.   b_jonas  21:18, 1 February 2006 (UTC)       [ edit ]   Aluminum or Titanium City?

So what do you think?Do you(or anybody) have any problem(or something you don't like) about that?   Media:User:Michael Behe     See  Wikipedia:What Wikipedia Is Not , and especially the bit about ""Wikipedia is not a soapbox"". Lots of people agree with your view, a lot of people, notably including the vast majority of earth and life scientists, don't. But Wikipedia is not the place to have a debate on it. Even on articles like  Intelligent design , theoretically, the only purpose of debate on the talk page is to determine whether the article is a  neutral  account of the topic, rather than whether any particular view on the topic is the  correct  one. -- Robert Merkel  06:09, 31 January 2006 (UTC)       Unless you really are  Michael Behe , you probably shouldn't sign questions with his name. I have some doubt that he'd present the argument in this way. You should read our article about him and  Creation-evolution controversy .       Now, let's see...           In  science , a  theory  explains and  predicts  the behavior of a particular system, based on the prior body of science and specific  observations . If a theory explains behavior poorly, it is refined or incorporated into a new theory to account for the discrepancy. Theories are rarely discarded entirely, because they often make useful predictions for certain limited domains. For example,  Newton's laws of motion  work pretty well in most conditions, but they're incorrect in many situations.  Einstein 's  theory of relativity  is more correct.   Theories are  never  proven true.   The only  facts  are direct observations. Unfortunately, any line of reasoning that follows an observation is inherently subjective. The  mind-body problem  is intractable.   Instead, theories are shown to be accurate descriptions of events. If a theory predicts specific behavior in a certain situation, and subsequent observations closely match the predicted behavior, the theory is shown to be accurate. By constructing  experiments  that reproduce situations a theory makes predictions for, anyone can verify the accuracy of a theory.   An experiment that produces results contrary to the predictions of a theory demonstrates the theory is inaccurate regarding the situation under study.   There are no experiments that produce results contrary to the predictions of evolutionary theory.   There have been very many experiments that have found particular predictions of evolutionary theory to be accurate.   Evolutionary theory makes predictions that can explain practically all the observations made in the field of  biology : it is considered a very useful theory, and that is why it is taught.   There is opposition to teaching  Intelligent Design  because it appears to promote particular  religious  beliefs.   In the  United States , it is generally considered that the writing of  Thomas Jefferson  demonstrates the  Establishment Clause  of the  First Amendment  is intended to place ""a  wall of separation  between church and state"". The  Fourteenth Amendment  requires each state to adhere to the  Bill of Rights . Thus, it would be unconstitutional to teach Intelligent Design in state-run  public schools .               As Michael Behe would argue, there are particular features of  microorganisms  that are difficult to explain from a  mechanist  point of view. For example, in his view,  flagella  developed specifically for the purpose of producing motion. As a flagellum is immobile if it lacks particular components, and evolutionary theory cannot explain why this logically prior form of flagellum would randomly evolve a missing component that makes it fit for motion, Behe considers evolutionary theory to be deficient.   From the point of view of evolutionary theory, Behe's argument of  irreducible complexity  is backward: the theory does not posit that features evolve for a purpose. The ubiquity of flagella indicates they are not detrimental to organisms. It does not indicate a necessity for organisms to have flagella. The fact that evolution conserves the form of flagella indicates their precise structure is crucial to the useful functions they serve.               09:56, 31 January 2006 (UTC)     Cool!

One often doesn't find the right info on something but Googling ""thirty cloth"" just gives too many results with the  number  thirty. Can anyone think of a beter way to search for info? I could of course try to ask a weaver, but there aren't too many of those around anymore. Arnold Schunck wove only wool and thirty, so it must have been of some importance.  DirkvdM  21:21, 31 January 2006 (UTC)     I looked too. I suspect it was a local name for a denim or jean workcloth, produced at the time. The number probably refers to weight, ie. something weird like 30 stone per roll. This article is very interesting.  [79]  -- Zeizmic  22:17, 31 January 2006 (UTC)       okay, I'm more convinced than ever that is was a weight, most likely the cut system, and the cloth was a 30-cut, as shown here  [80]  -- Zeizmic  00:32, 1 February 2006 (UTC)           this  site speaks of ""Cotton yarn 10/s, 16/s, 20/s, 24/s, 30/s, 32/s carded, combed waxed and un waxed"". But  textiles/hemp_reports.htm this  site ( http://www.bioregional.com/programme_projects/pap_fibres_prog/hemp  textiles/hemp_reports.htm - link doesn't work because of space) says ""extremely fine hemp yarn at 30 Nm is apparently produced in China."" Nm means Joule (at least, I suppose that's what's meant), which is the unit for energy, so maybe that refers to the cloth's strength? I can't find anything conclusive. Alas not enough to base an explanation (or even an article) on.  Yarn  and  textile manufacturing  don't help either. I really want to know this now.

He was educated at a number of local  schools , and during the Chicago  influenza  epidemic in 1891 spent a half year on his brothers' ranch on the  Raft River  in  Idaho . He then attended the  Phillips Academy  in  Andover, Massachusetts  and then the  Michigan Military Academy . Graduating in 1895, and failing the entrance exam for  West Point , he ended up as an enlisted  soldier  with the  7th U.S. Cavalry  in  Fort Grant ,  Arizona Territory . After being diagnosed with a  heart  problem and thus found ineligible for a commission, he was discharged in 1897.   What followed was a string of seemingly unrelated and short stint jobs. Following a period of drifting and ranch work in  Idaho , Burroughs found work at his father's firm in 1899. He married Emma Centennia Hulbert in 1900. In 1904 he left his job and found less regular work, initially in Idaho but soon back in Chicago.   By 1911, after seven years of low wages, he was working as a  pencil sharpener  wholesaler and began to write fiction. By this time Burroughs and Emma had two children, Joan and Hulbert. During this period, he had copious spare time and he began reading many  pulp fiction magazines  and has since claimed:     ""...if people were paid for writing rot such as I read in some of those magazines that I could write stories just as rotten. As a matter of fact, although I had never written a story, I knew absolutely that I could write stories just as entertaining and probably a whole lot more so than any I chanced to read in those magazines.""     Aiming his work at these pulp fiction magazines, his first story ""Under the Moons of Mars"" was serialized in  The All-Story  magazine in 1912 [ 1 ] [ 2 ]  and earned Burroughs US$400 (roughly the equivalent of US$7600 in 2004).   Burroughs soon took up writing full-time and by the time the run of  Under the Moons of Mars  had finished he had completed two  novels , including  Tarzan of the Apes , which was published from October 1912 and went on to begin his most successful series. In 1913, Burroughs and Emma had their third and last child, John Coleman.   Burroughs also wrote popular  science fiction  and  fantasy  stories involving Earthly adventurers transported to various  planets  (notably  Barsoom , Burroughs' fictional name for  Mars , and  Amtor , his fictional name for  Venus ), lost  islands , and into the interior of the  hollow earth  in his  Pellucidar  stories, as well as  westerns  and historical romances. Along with  All-Story , many of his stories were published in the  Argosy Magazine .   Tarzan  was a cultural sensation when introduced. Burroughs was determined to capitalize on Tarzan's popularity in every way possible. He planned to exploit Tarzan through several different media including a syndicated Tarzan  comic strip ,  movies  and merchandise. Experts in the field advised against this course of action, stating that the different media would just end up competing against each other. Burroughs went ahead, however, and proved the experts wrongthe public wanted Tarzan in whatever fashion he was offered. Tarzan remains one of the most successful fictional characters to this day and is a  cultural icon .   In 1923 Burroughs set up his own company,  Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. , and began printing his own  books  through the 1930s. He divorced Emma in 1934 and married former actress  Florence Gilbert Dearholt  in 1935, ex-wife of his friend,  Ashton Dearholt , adopting the Dearholts' two children. They divorced in 1942.   At the time of the attack on  Pearl Harbor  he was a resident of Hawaii and, despite being in his late sixties, he asked for permission to be a  war correspondent . This permission was granted and so he became the oldest war correspondent for the U.S. during  World War II . After the war ended, Burroughs moved back to  Encino, California , where, after many health problems, he died of a heart attack on March 19, 1950, having written almost seventy novels.   The towns of  Tarzana, California  and  Tarzan, Texas  were named after Tarzan. In 1919 Burroughs purchased a large ranch north of  Los Angeles, California  which he named ""Tarzana."" The citizens of the community that sprang up around the ranch voted to adopt that name when their town was incorporated in 1928. And the unincorporated community of Tarzan, Texas was formally named in 1927 when the postal service accepted the name, reputedly coming from the popularity of the first (silent) ""Tarzan of the Apes"" film, starring Elmo Lincoln, and an early ""Tarzan"" comic strip.   The  Burroughs  crater on Mars is named in Burroughs' honor.

Please help  improve this section  by adding citations to  reliable sources .  Unverifiable  material may be challenged and removed.  (October 2008)       Burroughs's work has had an influence on many science fiction and fantasy writers, including  H. P. Lovecraft  ( The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath ),  Robert E. Howard  ( Almuric ),  Leigh Brackett  (especially her novels and novellas set on Mars and Venus),  Lin Carter  (a significant number of overt pastiches), and  Ray Bradbury , who have exerted a considerable influence of their own on the science fiction and fantasy genres. Brackett and Bradbury actually collaborated on the famous 1946 Burroughs-derivative novella  Lorelei of the Red Mist . In addition, fantasy writer  Michael Moorcock , who co-wrote the screenplay for the 1975 film adaptation of  The Land That Time Forgot , in 1965-66 released a trilogy of Burroughs pastiches,  Warriors of Mars ,  Blades of Mars , and  Barbarians of Mars  under the telling pseudonym ""Edward P. Bradbury"".   Certainly the most evident feature of Burroughs's novels is their frequently formulaic nature. There are plentiful mad scientists and mad queens, strong but honorable heroes, and a nearly certain guarantee that the hero of any novel will fall in love with a woman who sooner or later turns out to be a princess. Unlike a lot of recent fiction, the main characters are never equivocal about their good or bad natures. While the plot structures are therefore predictable, they are nevertheless satisfying, accounting in large measure for their continuing success. There is a  Horatio Alger -like implication that honesty, courage, and hard work will eventually succeed (e.g.,  John Carter 's frequent exclamation, ""I still live!"") and that scheming, avarice, hatred, and laziness will not. And even this formulaic nature, not original with but perfected by Burroughs, has had a host of imitators, right through to the  Star Wars  films, which include many of the famous Burroughs tropes, such as the princess in distress (Princess Leia) rescued by the hero.   Burroughs will never be lifted up as a great prose stylist; certainly the Mars of his finest successors -  C. S. Lewis  (who acknowledges in the preface to  Out of the Silent Planet  his debt to pulp science fiction writers, though he does not name Burroughs specifically),  Leigh Brackett ,  Ray Bradbury  ( The Martian Chronicles ), and  Frederick Turner  ( A Double Shadow  and  Genesis: An Epic Poem ) - are described with a poetic eloquence that he never matched even briefly. Nevertheless his descriptions of anciently abandoned cities succumbing to the deserts of dying Mars or the grandly upswinging horizon of  Pellucidar , for example, create a lasting impression and account in no small measure for his enduring popularity. And, more than lacking the scholarly rigor of contemporary authors like  Ben Bova  and  Kim Stanley Robinson , Burroughs did not hesitate to sweep scientific fact out of the way of a good story; still, his inventiveness (the atmosphere plants striving to maintain the dissipating atmosphere on Mars come to mind, or the ring of planets in the same orbital plane in  Beyond the Farthest Star ) was not lacking in intelligent creativity.   Critics have often derided Burroughs, not unfairly, as in main an author of mere hastily written escapist fantasy, and certainly the world would be little the poorer without such shabby efforts as  Synthetic Men of Mars ,  The Deputy Sheriff of Comanche County , and  The Monster Men . But some scholars, most notably Richard A. Lupoff [ 4 ] , have pointed to the stories in  Jungle Tales of Tarzan , clearly influenced by Native American traditional stories [ 5 ] , and the novels  Tarzan of the Apes  (first in the series),  The Mucker , and  The Moon Maid , among others, as evidence that Burroughs could indeed compose works of considerable quality when he took the time to do so. And his courage to write in many genres - not only science fiction and fantasy, but Westerns (especially  The War Chief  and  Apache Devil ), then-modern gritty drama reminiscent of  Frank Norris  or even  F. Scott Fitzgerald  (such as  The Efficiency Expert ,  The Girl from Farris's , and  Marcia of the Doorstep ), historical fiction ( The Outlaw of Torn  and  I am a Barbarian ), and even a stage play ( You Lucky Girl! , which finally debuted to very positive reviews in 1997  [ 6 ] ) - suggest his determination to be considered a serious author.   Burroughs often displayed a sense of social consciousness that, if unremarkable today, was in his time (and especially among the authors and genres with which he is most associated, groups that were socially conservative because their goal was to provide escapist entertainment, not to challenge the status quo) quite unusual; in this wise Burroughs deserves comparison with how  Harriet Beecher Stowe  transformed the stereotypical ""slave romance"" for white audiences into a powerful polemic against slavery or how  Charles Dickens  magnified the popular periodical-serialized novel into an urgent call for class reform. While Jews, for instance, are unfortunately sometimes portrayed in negative stereotype in the  Tarzan  novels,  The Red Hawk , the third section of  The Moon Maid , includes an elderly Jewish character who is drawn sympathetically as evidencing considerable heroism. Likewise, Blacks (again, especially in the  Tarzan  novels, but also in the  Mars  series) and Asians (particularly in the three-part  The Moon Maid ) are depicted sometimes as stereotypes and just as frequently as wise or valorous. His Native American characters, from the early Westerns to  The Red Hawk  are more universally presented as honorable and courageous, in a time when the military subjugation of Native Americans was still vivid memory; based loosely on Native Americans, the green Martians (like the black, white, red, and yellow races) have their villains and heroes, including a woman named Sola and the magnificently fierce chief Tars Tarkas. Burroughs's female characters are frequently not simply there to scream and be rescued and later espoused by the heroes (as is the case in other genre fiction of his day, a time when women's suffrage was still a hot issue), but as equal counterparts: just as strong, intelligent, courageous, and resourceful as the males. To give but one example, Tavia in  A Fighting Man of Mars  fights side by side with Tan Hadron of Hastor, the protagonist, with equal effectiveness, setting up a deliberately sharp contrast (with which Burroughs concludes the story) to the beautiful but vain and vapid Sanoma Tora with whom Hadron had thought he was in love. It seems fair to say that Burroughs, who as noted was a moral absolutist, tended to portray individuals of every race and both genders as just that - as individuals, whose words and actions were what made them good or bad, and not their sex or heritage.   While Burroughs's antipathy for organized religion recurs as a frequent motif in his writings, his attitudes toward war appears to have changed during his career. Hollow idols and conniving clergy are deliciously skewered throughout the  Mars  series (especially among the Therns, but not to overlook the hilarious ""Tur is Tur"" scene in  The Mastermind of Mars ), but these are counterbalanced by refreshing references to the courageous soul seeking strength to go on by communing with a benign creator, references that have the feel of the spirituality of the Native Americans of the Great Plains, with whom Burroughs was surely acquainted. On the other hand, while war is painted as glorious and heroic in such earlier tomes as  The Warlord of Mars ,  Beyond the Farthest Star  suggests that in his last years, as this planet was tilting toward a second world war, Burroughs was ready to decry honestly the brutality of carnage that he himself witnessed as a war correspondent. It could even be postulated that Burroughs's most prescient vision of the future was in his implicit reevaluation of the then-axiomatic assumptions in dominant American society about religion and war, in his dramatization of the idea that social institutions serve humanity ill when they are misused to bolster the greed for vicious domination of the powerless, and his insistence that the individual who holds to the essential ethic of doing good to others is never entirely powerless against such institutions.   In conclusion, therefore, Burroughs would be unfairly dismissed as merely a hack writer; he seems not only to have striven to supersede his evident limitations as an author, but also to have striven against the prejudices and presumptions of his day. While the extent of his influence in this regard can of course not be measured, it must not be overlooked.     [ edit ]   Popular culture     In the video game  Jurassic Park: Trespasser  there is a statue of E. R. Burroughs, possibly as a reference to his novel  The Land That Time Forgot .       In chapter 16 of  Stephen King 's novel  Desperation  can be found the line "" The Farting Buzzards of Desperation . Sounds like a... Edgar Rice Burroughs novel, doesn't it?"" (Such adjective-noun-noun titles are actually a rarity among Burrough's novels; the closest analogue would be  The Deputy Sheriff of Comanche County .)       In  Rainbow Mars  by  Larry Niven , several different fictional Martian races appear, including a people who are a combination of the Red Martians of Edgar Rice Burroughs and those by  Ray Bradbury , and another who are unmistakably Burroughs' big fierce Green Martians.       In the  Mars Trilogy  novels of  Kim Stanley Robinson  the original capital city on Mars is named Burroughs as a sort of tribute. It is later flooded.       Season 1, Episode 29 of Disney's  The Legend of Tarzan  animated series,  Tarzan and the Mysterious Visitor , illustrates Burroughs as a struggling writer who travels to Africa in search of inspiration for a new novel (actually, Burroughs never set foot in Africa). In the cartoon he is called ""Ed.""       The 1980 novel  The Number of the Beast , by  Robert A. Heinlein  featured characters named  Zebediah John Carter ,  Jacob Burroughs , and  Dejah Thoris Burroughs  in homage to Burroughs' Mars novels. Among other things, these and the other main characters travel to various alternate universes, including  Barsoom ,  Oz  and  Wonderland . The protagonist of Heinlein's  Glory Road  muses on  Barsoom  in one passage.       The Marvel Comics book Excalibur created by  Chris Claremont  and  Alan Davis  paid a tribute to the John Carter stories in issue #16 and 17. The story was billed on the cover of issue #16 as ""Kurt Wagner Warlord ofÂ ?"". The series added a further tribute with issue #60 and the story ""Braddock of the jungle"".       In  The Alternate Martians  (Ace, 1965)  A. Bertram Chandler  explored a fictional Mars curiously combining characters, including Deliah (for Dejah) Thoris and Tars Tarkas, and characteristics of Burroughs's  Barsoom  with the malevolent Martians of  The War of the Worlds  by  H. G. Wells .       In  Frank Frazetta's Creatures  published by the Frazetta Comics imprint at Image Burroughs appears as a member of a group of supernatural investigators led by former US president  Theodore Roosevelt .       In  Rocky II , Rocky reads ""The Deputy Sheriff of Comanche County"" to Adrian while she is in a coma.

I know you have been very hurt by the disgusting treatment you have received in this horrible debacle. As you, together with Geogre, are amongst the encyclopedia's finest and most valuable editors you deserved better. However, I'm planning to say little more on the subject unless I'm attacked again. I have proved my point about the IRC admin channel, and many people (whose opinion matters to me) now seem to believe all I have ben saying was true. The channel is now thoroughly discredited and will never be a source of power again, and used by anyone of Wikipedian value - it is now basically finished - no one will ever believe a word that emanates from it again, no doubt a few little firecrackers will continue to pop on admins notice boards and such places but I think people can now evaluate such comments for themselves and see them for what they are dying embers of a former power base. Once again thanks for your support in this. I have appreciated it.  Giano  10:46, 17 January 2007 (UTC)     De nada, Giacomo. I wish the Wikimedia foundation would remove the official-sounding name from  #wikipedia-en-admins , that's all. It's all wrong that that poison pit should have ""Wikipedia"" in its name. And who's going to remove this claim in  WP:IRC : "" The Wikipedia channels on freenode are the official place to chat about Wikipedia on IRC. "" The arbcom have shown that statement to be false--nothing official about it, no Wikimedia control of it.  Bishonen  |  talk  13:03, 17 January 2007 (UTC).    I've made the change. I mentioned it on the talk page to the IRC page. We'll see what happens next.  Geogre  13:28, 17 January 2007 (UTC)                I went one step further  [1] . Cheers.  Ben Aveling  11:42, 18 January 2007 (UTC)           Unfortunately within minutes of me announcing I was stepping back Tony and the IRC gang immediately began to blacken my name again on IRC  [2]  I never believed the new ""policemen"" would bother to do anything about it, but I did expect at least a pretence!  Giano  13:32, 17 January 2007 (UTC)                   [ edit ]   Restoration literature question   Congratulations on the front page article - seems it's been listed for ages though. It's really nice to see an overview article of such quality there. It seems sometimes, that only the more marginal, niche articles can jump the hurdles, whilst the invaluable overviews get bogged down in disputes and difficulties - getting a single editorial 'voice' for these articles is a real achievement. -- Mcginnly  |  Natter  00:47, 18 January 2007 (UTC)     Ah, that's on today? Cool. Geogre wrote it, you know, I just contributed a section. He's the one with the soaring eagle eye!  Bishonen  |  talk  01:25, 18 January 2007 (UTC).   Yes, it is, and it's wonderful too; I've set it aside to look forward to reading in detail in the morning.  Newyorkbrad  01:26, 18 January 2007 (UTC)   I will be reading it this morning as well as I don't think I've read it completely through. It will also give context to  The Man of Mode , next on my reading list after finishing  Tis Pity She's a Whore .  *Exeunt*  Ganymead  |  Dialogue?  14:28, 18 January 2007 (UTC)    You haven't read  The Man of Mode , Gan? I think you'll  really  like it. I feel it's like the perfect play for you. It's as funny as all getout.  Bishonen  |  talk  20:14, 18 January 2007 (UTC).    I'm quite excited about it. After  Tis Pity , I need something a bit lighter.  *Exeunt*  Ganymead  |  Dialogue?  20:33, 18 January 2007 (UTC)       I second that.  Man of Mode  is fantastic, and so is  Love for Love.  Really fun parts for an actor and great jokes. (I'm only at the computer for a few minutes, but the shocked FAR fanatics on the talk page and the griping piping voices deserved a swatting.)  Geogre  21:21, 18 January 2007 (UTC)           [ edit ]   Alkalada   Alkalada is begging me to be unblocked and promising good behavior. I'd like to give him a chance. Any objections?  Fred Bauder  17:41, 18 January 2007 (UTC)     Who...? Oh, I see. He's a very young editor but with a pretty bad record of POV-pushing and puppeteering and intransigence. This time he has apparently done exactly what I asked [3]   [4] , that's great. I hope he's turning over a new leaf. Feel free to unblock. I also suggest the harmless indulgence of asking him which identity he likes best, unblock that one, and exhort him to stick to it. Tell him I'll know if he creates any more socks. (I will, as his style is unmistakable.)  Bishonen  |  talk  20:11, 18 January 2007 (UTC).    Thank you, unblocking  Alkalada  ( talk    contribs    deleted contribs    logs    block user    block log ) .  Fred Bauder  00:54, 20 January 2007 (UTC)         I'd just like to point out that  Hahahihihoho , using the account  Alkalada , is back to his old ways and hasn't changed his ways at all, so I've requested that Alkalada be blocked at  Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets    King Ivan  08:15, 22 January 2007 (UTC)   Now, I have put sources on most of the things I have changed like the demographics of Bosnia and like the names of cities in Northern Bosnia. And if somebody is BORN IN BOSNIA, THEN HE IS AUTOMATICALLY A BOSNIAN, it doesnt matter wheather he is a croat, serb or bosniaks.   How can somebody bor in Bosnia be Croatian?  Alkalada  11:31, 22 January 2007 (UTC)   And if you continue like this then I will report you for vandalism.  Alkalada  11:32, 22 January 2007 (UTC)   Okey, this is enough.   Bishonen, and all other moderators, I am hearby reporting user Ivan Kricancic for repeted vandalism. This user has not put a single source on his edits and continued his vandalims without any reference to source. He is just taking away articles where he wants and when he wants.   Because of that, I report him now for constantly vandalism.  Alkalada  11:40, 22 January 2007 (UTC)     The only one vandalizing and violating Wikipedia policies is YOU,  User:Hahahihihoho . Please refrain from violating Wikiepdia policies.  King Ivan  11:44, 22 January 2007 (UTC)     Ehum... you are violating wikipedia policies when you TAKE AWAY SOURCED ARTICLES.  Alkalada  14:39, 22 January 2007 (UTC)     [ edit ]   No personal attacks   With regard to reminding user's of policies like  WP:CIVIL ,  WP:AGF  and  WP:NPA , there is never any harm in repeating them. The use of templates for all users, established or not, is not prohibited. I prefer them because it is my epxerience that in many situations they are preferable to users actually speaking their mind (like your comment about users leaving).   If you believe that the personal attack referenced is harmless then you will not mind me making the same comment with regard to your so-called advice: why are you so interested in me? Per  WP:NPA  you should comment on contributions and not contributors.   Posting a comment like "" Yes, I do see that you announce your imminent departure, but that doesn't malke me think this advice redundant. Most people who make such announcements, in my experience, tend to retract them pretty soon. "" ( diff ) does not sound productive to me. It sounds like a challenge, which can deter users from returning. If that is your intent I find it utterly disgusting. I would advise you to please consider phrasing yourself differently in the future, or if that is not possible to refrain from commenting at all. Such comments are not helpful.   -- Oden  22:20, 18 January 2007 (UTC)     Ah, there speaks the  wikilawyer !  It's not prohibited . I explain to you what bad ideas it is to point to the three Troll Favorite Policies, and to use templates against established users; I enlighten you as to the massive consensus against such behaviour; and that's all you've got? (Well, except that you prefer templates because they're preferable, but that doesn't do a lot for the advancement of human knowledge, either.) It's ""not prohibited"" so I'm going to do it? Don't worry, I'm not going to waste any more of my time explaining stuff to you.  Bishonen  |  talk  22:45, 18 January 2007 (UTC).       Unbelievable: Templates are for use with null accounts and incommunicative users. Experienced administrators use them for IP accounts and nonce accounts, where there is every reason to believe that there is ""no one"" there or that the person there is absolutely committed to trolling. They are never appropriate for established users,  ever.  They are incommunicative, carry with them no explanation, and have no justification offered within them. They're billboards, not communication. It is disruptive and inappropriate to try to drive users away, even bad ones, as bad turns to good, but gone never turns that way. To say that there is a consensus against this use, Bishonen, is  litotes . There is virtual unanimity about it.

It's an annotated copy of a timeline Gangsta put together. Tiger and I have been discussing it and we don't believe that it demonstrates that Tiger has been abusive. (A sock, yes, but you and I could both be hung for that.) I'd like your feedback. I want to take this back to ANI and I'd very much like to have your support when I do.

El_C  13:06, 19 January 2007 (UTC)     I've been curious to see how this has been turning out and I think you may find  User_talk:BenAveling/RevolverOcelotX_allegations  interesting. I couldn't quite understand why the editor was so emphatic in the blocked user's innocence. The page in summation attributes all the problems the blocked user has had to differences with only me and Certified Gangsta. I think someone's altruistic tendancies might be creating a cognitive bias that is starting to skew the obvious facts in reality here. The blocked editor has had problems with many other editors on Wikipedia, me and CG are the only ones (and you) who tried to do anything about it. Enjoy your day.

Tom Harrison   Talk  14:49, 20 January 2007 (UTC)     [ edit ]   A vs An   Do we refer to  a  hypothesis or  an  hypothesis - I think it might be  an . We usually put an  an  in front of words beginning with vowels eg.  an irritation  but I've got it in my head that  h  sometimes has a peculiar status eg.  an honourable peace . Is this just 1. a product of my confusion or 2. archaic usage or 3. quite correct?......-- Mcginnly  |  Natter  16:51, 20 January 2007 (UTC)     You didn't think of asking me? I'm tempted not to answer, but the pedantic urge is too strong. /H/ is not a consonant. It is an aspirant. (I.e. it is a breath mark. It tells us to blow out with a hhhhhhhhhh.) Therefore, traditionally, we treat words beginning with /h/ as beginning with whatever letter comes next, which is usually a vowel.  However,  many people now think it sounds weird and therefore will use ""a."" Basically, I say ""an hypothesis"" and ""an history,"" but some people will think these are wrong. It's considered a little fussy to use the 'an', but it's still correct. (Sorry, Bish, but I  had  to.)  Geogre  16:57, 20 January 2007 (UTC)    Geogre, I did think of asking you, but as my first point of call for dumb questions I thought I'd spread the burden out a bit.....Thanks very much for the confirmation. -- Mcginnly  |  Natter  17:12, 20 January 2007 (UTC)    I disagree in part, though: At least in the Eastern U.S., any word beginning with a sounded ""h"" takes ""a"".  Newyorkbrad  17:14, 20 January 2007 (UTC)    I say and write  a hypothesis  and  a history , but  an hour  and  an heir . See also  A, an#Discrimination between a and an .  Mets501  ( talk )  17:36, 20 January 2007 (UTC)               Well, we're right back in the old descriptive vs. proscriptive argument. The  rule  is that /h/ is not a consonant. The  practice  and therefore growing  usage  is to treat it as ""not a vowel and therefore as a consonant."" Ultimately, the reason the rule came into force in the first place as a disambiguation, as it were. English doesn't like blending vowels between words, and so we use the nasal to provide a stop. Thus, we had ""thy glory"" vs. ""thine arm,"" as well as ""my bird"" vs. ""mine emu."" The rule is exactly the same, and you're still actually  correct  to put the /n/, but the language is losing those rules (by analogy to the loss of nasal pronouns? as part of the same shift?), so it's debatable whether ""a history"" is wrong or not.  Geogre  19:54, 20 January 2007 (UTC)           "" pro scriptive"" (thou shalt not) or "" pre scriptive"" (thou shalt)? Per Fowler, on  split infinitives , there are those who neither know nor care; those who do not know but care very much; those who know and condemn; those who know and approve; and those who know and distinguish. Let us all hope for the sensibility to fall into the last camp. --  ALoan   (Talk)  11:38, 22 January 2007 (UTC)         Ask and ye shall receive.  Both are acceptable .  Raul654  19:58, 20 January 2007 (UTC)     If we wanted to be linguists, we'd figger out what it is about some vowel lengths that, when aspirated, need no stops. I.e. ""hy"" is longer and heavier than ""how"" or ""hoi,"" and therefore ""hypothesis"" and ""hyperbole"" and ""hyperborean"" all  feel  like they need no nasal stop before them, where as ""howl"" feels like it does. If the u is really yu (""hubris""), we  feel  like it's heavy, too. However, I traded in my linguist badge for a crossing guard sash years ago, so I'm not qualified by temperament or training.  Geogre  20:35, 20 January 2007 (UTC)     'ard 'earted 'ercules 'it his 'orse over its 'ed with  an  'ammer cause it to give  an  'orrible 'owl. So for a cockney everyfink beginnin wiv H 'as an an. ie. maybe your suggestion re. vowel lengths is only going to work with  received pronunciation  -- Mcginnly  |  Natter  22:17, 20 January 2007 (UTC)     Not that I'm at all qualified to judge this, but the obvious rule seems to be that ""a"" goes with ""h"" that is pronounced (""hhhh""), and ""an"" goes with ""h"" that is silent. An honour, an hour, a hotel, a horror. Counterexamples, please?  Kosebamse  08:25, 21 January 2007 (UTC)       To tell the truth, each of those. The thing is that we're at the point of discarding an ancient rule in English. Some people, like me, preserve it in written English (but not in spoken English) because I regard it as best to be conservative in writing. (In other words, some hypercorrectives will be offended if ""an"" isn't used, so I avoid being ""wrong"" to them. Additionally, I cannot be sure how the reader is going to pronounce the /h/. As Mcginnly's cockneys demonstrate, English speakers around the world treat the aspiration differently, so some will have more or less of a vocal initial sound, so ""an"" does them some service, while it just looks fussbudget to the people who aspirate heavily.) Since we've lost our /n/ speedbump between our pronouns, keeping it with /h/ may be gone already. Note that a good many people in speech will say ""a"" and  anything  following. The nasal is getting lost altogether. In 50-100 years, it seems like there will be no ""an"" at all. So, does one make a stand and fight for the /n/, or does one not? I do, but humbly.  Geogre  13:25, 21 January 2007 (UTC)       There is a strong distinction between British usage and North American usage (I have no idea about Commonwealth usage apart from Canada). In North America it is extremely rare to see ""an"" before a voiced ""h"". This has been the case for many years: I remember the issue coming up on an episode of  M*A*S*H  when upper class Bostonian, Charles Winchester, was revealed as an absurdly pretentious oaf for saying "" an  harmonica""...; that was in the mid-1970s. A further wrinkle is that of words like ""homage"" that may be pronounced with either a voiced or an unvoiced ""h""; I've seen examples in Canadian and US texts of both ""an homage"" (which I would srite and say) and ""a homage"".  Pinkville  14:05, 21 January 2007 (UTC)           With nothing better to do, I was mulling this over at the weekend and found another irregularity:- I would refer to  a  Royal air force engineer, but  an  R.A.F. engineer. - using the letter R, requiring the almost vowel-like  aaar' sound, also seems to require an  an . It also works for the sounded letters F (eff) L (el) M, N, S, X. -- Mcginnly  |  Natter  12:53, 22 January 2007 (UTC)         Never use ""a historical"" (sounds like ""ahistorical""); always use  A History of .  El_C  10:00, 23 January 2007 (UTC)     No, it doesn't, it sounds like ""a hysterical"". Always use ""A hysteria of"", as in "" The Oxford Hysteria of English Poetry .""

I'm not just disappointed, I'm  amazed  that you keep it up about Giano ""engaging in behavior as bad or worse than those you are pointing the finger at"", while at the same time acknowledging that you don't know what the behavior of ""those"" was-- and  at the same time dismissing any need for my attempt to give you a sense of it. None of it of interest, then? Not my suggestion that people who actually consult the records come away muttering ""I had no idea""? No concern with Kim Bruning's post above? Just Giano's ""incivil"" (pah!), so it's six of one and half a dozen of the other? Well, I'm past pretending to be sorry to have wasted your time; I don't think I took up a lot of it; I'm sorry to have wasted my own. I regret having expected to be read with interest. Forget it.

And  accountable  behavior in a transparent medium on Wikipedia (where it can be quoted ad nauseum) vs.  unaccountable  behavior in a ""you post it and I'll ban you"" medium like IRC cannot be ""equivalent"" from the start. And three vs. one and one vs. three isn't equivalent, either. And editor vs. admins and admins vs. editor isn't equivalent. And ""tell us to stop on this IRC channel you are supposed to be entitled to, and we'll threaten you"" isn't the same as ""Oh, go away  from my talk page , you pissant,"" either. No, I don't think any disinterested and rational person could see them as equivalent.  Geogre  11:27, 24 January 2007 (UTC)       [ edit ]   LOL   Nice one. Me harassing him.

If you're not interested, it's fine. The user set up the sock to pursue an RFC on how much minority point of view would be necessary in the  Taj Mahal  article, which is going to get worked up for serious review. Given that there are  some  minority points of view who feel that their nationalities and religious identities are invested in denying that the Taj was created for anything other than Hindu purposes, the matter is hot.

I've had my eyes on something for a while, that I don't know really what to do with. It  was  a very obvious case of vanity writing. Two articles got deleted. Now one of the articles is recreated, and it looks much better. Whether or not the subject is notable enough for an article, I really can't say.   On svwiki, I would take it to SFFR (AfD). However, the AfD's that got the two articles in question deleted had like four people saying anything on the subject; I have difficulties in believing this is a good way of dealing with it. I am not sure if one should take actions to get the stuff deleted or not. In a way, there are things more important to take care of. OTOH, my knee jerk reaction from the clear vanity start is to remove the group of articles ASAP. I wrote some kind of recollection of it all on  User:Habj/green burial stuff ; you can take a look if you like (but I don't expect you to). //  habj  12:56, 27 January 2007 (UTC)     [/Bishzilla stares at mysterious message, starts to get crosseyed with bootless concentration.]   Resident deletionist ? Take a look, please?  Bishzilla  |  grrrr!  17:02, 27 January 2007 (UTC).           I weighed in, there. Basically, my view is that we treat individual company presidents if they make a splash as individuals. We treat individual practitioners of an industry when they are far ahead, first, or biggest. Otherwise, we cover the industry, not some dude at some company doing it. Well written or poorly written articles are irrelevant, if the subject is inappropriate, because Wikipedia articles are page rank boosts, and therefore articles are money.  Geogre  17:40, 27 January 2007 (UTC)           [ edit ]   Two notes   Hi Bishonen. First of all, I'd like to offer my sympathies that Bishzilla didn't pass rfa; she would've gotten my support. Second, in response to your  comment  on  requests for arbitration , I think it was  The Land  who unblocked Giano. Cheers,  Picaroon  03:20, 29 January 2007 (UTC)     Oh, right! I still think there were more admins there, though, jockeying with The Land for first place. And El C (one of Carnildo's original three blockees) later did of those clever one-second ""that block reason wasn't true"" blocks of Giano. As for the uppity young monster, I think we all had a very narrow escape there.  Bishonen  |  talk  09:47, 29 January 2007 (UTC).    What you say!  Bishzilla  |  grrrr!  09:48, 29 January 2007 (UTC).         My recollection is that there were three admins who undid the block within minutes  The Land, Geni, and Worldtraveller. I can't recall the order, though.

From my vantage point, the answer is  supposed  to be ""writing an encyclopedia, educating others and ourselves, and, at the same time, having some fun and interacting with some interesting people."" At the moment I can still say that that's my answer. But I can understand if it is no longer yours.  Newyorkbrad  15:44, 29 January 2007 (UTC)    I agree with Newyorkbrad about this.

Hi Bishonen,   A few days you visited  Transcendental Meditation  to disabuse me of the notion that 3RR did not apply to multiple serial bad edits that could not be considered to be ""vandalism.""   A new editor,  BabyDweezil , has shown up recently on the ""cult"" pages and has been making multiple serial edits in violation of guidelines on four or five articles. Here is a recent  example . He is starting to do this faster then we can revert it without 3RR'ing.   What recourse do we have? DR seems to be too slow, the articles could be in tatters by then. Thanks.  Tanaats  02:11, 1 February 2007 (UTC)     I've left a note for the user to stop making far-reaching changes against consensus, and will keep an eye on what happens. It's really late at night where I am, so I haven't done much research yet. Please don't keep reverting, especially not to the point where you bump up against the 3RR. I don't think there's any real hurryI know one  feels  that articles are being destroyed when something like this happens, but it's all still there in the history. The main thing is to make the user aware of policy in the matter of consensus, talkpage discussions, and unilateral changes, and persuade them to abide by it. I can see that the other editors have been arguing with BabyDweezil on Talk, which is exactly the right thing to do. The next step is also exactly what you did: contact an admin. We'll have to see if further steps turn out to be needed; I hope not.  Bishonen  |  talk  02:59, 1 February 2007 (UTC).           A distorted account by  Tanaats --that was the  only  large deletion i made, (not ""a recent example""), i've explained all my edits, and have been thanked more than once for removing some flagrant un-Wiki material inserted over time by the very POV pushing bloc of editors who are now complaining. The claim that Ive made ""multiple serial edits in violation of guidelines on four or five articles"" is Tanaats opinion at best and an exaggerated fabrication at worst (and its such displays of drama substituting for simple facts which i have had to deal with of late in editing these articles). Please feel free to review my edits and the discussions.  BabyDweezil  03:47, 1 February 2007 (UTC)               Bishonen, yes the most recent example was the most egregious. Things are escalating. Previously I was dealing with multiple one-liners or one-paragraphers a day.   Thanks for the advice. I've taken my finger off of the revert button.   Thank you for taking an interest in this.

I'm trying my hardest to be good, kind and nice at the moment so I don't want to be the first to comment, perhaps if nodody comments it will all go away - I'm not very good with the ostrich technique either though - and all this smiling like  jaws  is starting to hurt my facial muscles. All very problematic, isn't it?  Giano  08:48, 6 February 2007 (UTC)    PS: What I don't understand is surely it would be quicker to just clean a page up, than keep plastering these templates everywhere  Giano  08:50, 6 February 2007 (UTC)    Well, you need to wear a crocodile suit to clean up Albion, since you very kindly wrote it for  Restoration spectacular , if you recollect. That may be the problem. I suppose I'll go see if the Copyedit Lite is warranted a little later. Inline cites for  Restoration literature  is a harder proposition, because Geogre don't  want  them, and decorating my drama section alone wouldn't be much use. I think I'll just wait for Geogrezilla to rear up out of the waves, I suggest you do the same. Mmmm, breakfast time. [ /Bishzilla eats three templates and a bucket of inline citations.  ]  Bishzilla  |  grrrr!  09:29, 6 February 2007 (UTC).               I think the nomination is in bad faith. If we look, we will see the same fun faces making the same fun comments as ever. Explaining to such persons  again  why,  again,  their requirements are not the FA requirements is virtually useless, and the wider audience seems to have been driven away. What's worse is that there  are  ""inline citations"" in the article, but they're parenthetical reference, and I explained on the talk page to the article why there aren't more of them. To cite every citation that is internal to one of the blue linked articles would make for 100kb of references.  Geogre  11:26, 6 February 2007 (UTC)    Bad faith? Hardly; I haven't been involved in any of your previous discussions on this topic. It's just that FA standards as they are currently interpreted require a good amount of inline citations, which this article doesn't yet have. I think the article is fantastic, I'm just pointing out that it needs the citations to retain its FA badge. --  mattb   @ 2007-02-06T16:31Z     Perhaps you'd like to point out the part of the policy that says this? Have you read the discussion on the talk page? -- Mcginnly  |  Natter  16:42, 6 February 2007 (UTC)                           I have to admit, I have only just read the recent traffic on  Wikipedia talk:Featured article review , and I am beginning the see the  WP:POINT . --  ALoan   (Talk)  17:39, 6 February 2007 (UTC)    My particular favourite was  It's a fine article, though, and surely shouldn't be knocked for having its shirt buttons foppishly undone.

Regarding whether the nomination was good faith, Matt has said it was, so let's assume it was.  Marskell  19:07, 6 February 2007 (UTC)             Good faith or not, and I know nothing about English lit - I liked Enid Blyton as a child - and read Lady Chat as a spotty youth (vastly over-rated I never did find the very rudest bits) but, and I don't mean to be rude, but aren't poems supposed to rhyme?  Giano  19:14, 6 February 2007 (UTC)                           Ha! Of course they are. But then they started teaching all this modernist rubbish.  Marskell  19:20, 6 February 2007 (UTC)    For further information on modernist rubbish and the like, you may want to check out another un-footnoted FA,  The Cantos  and  Objectivist poets .Â :-)  *Exeunt*  Ganymead  |  Dialogue?  19:26, 6 February 2007 (UTC)                                           Oh damn--no inline cites on  The Cantos . Perhaps best not to mention it or people will get ideas.                                               To be serious about one thing: footnotes are a  form  of inline citation, not synonymous with inline citation. No one on FAR says ""insufficient footnotes"". All systems tend toward a norm, of course, and the little numbers are it with Wiki. But the Harvard style is arguably better with some of the Lit pieces that rely only on paper sources and is still perfectly acceptable.  Marskell  19:50, 6 February 2007 (UTC)                   If anyone even thinks about nominating  The Cantos  (ever) then Wikipedia deserves to die slowly and horribly, most horribly - consumed by its own ignorance!  Giano  19:53, 6 February 2007 (UTC)           Ok, perhaps it's a good faith nomination. Still, it seems like I, at least, am being called upon to deal death and destruction upon those I have already been on record as opposing. Basically, that article used its internal links for the most part. Let's put it this way (long version, be warned), I set out to write  The Dunciad . I figured that I wanted an article on every one of the dunces. I used the  DNB  for the biographies. The  DNB  used the same sources that I've used in the past. Then there were all the works of literature, which I just  read.  So, then we get some really out of the way stuff, like  Gondibert,  which fairly no one in their right mind reads. I read about .25 of it, but the very beginning is a ""preface"" by Hobbes talking about how much he admires it. I was at one time reading up everything I could by D'Avenant, and one of his scrofulous sons. (I was doing that because I was researching Ombre, which I was doing for  Rape of the Lock,  and Charles Cotton wrote  The Compleat Gamester,  which I read and tried to decipher.) Anyway, so there is all of that. So, the article itself says, ""D'Avenant tried the epic with  Gondibert,  which Hobbes praised."" To what would I footnote? I already have a link to D'Avenant. I had woven in...somewhere... the ""prefaces"" and the debate over form. I think it was in  Restoration poetry . At  this date,  I have to try to puzzle out and  manufacture  notes that would be both false and useless to satisfy people who admit that they don't know the subject? I suppose anyone could see why I'm not very eager.  Geogre  01:57, 7 February 2007 (UTC)    Oh, and here's a first, or at least a first in a while: I gave a civility warning to LuciferMorgan for the rather unpleasantly personal comments at FAR. It was one of those fragmentation grenade comments, and those can wake even me from my lethargy.  Geogre  09:41, 7 February 2007 (UTC)    I  did one  myself, requesting either diffs or withdrawal of the lies. Yours was fine, Geogre, but in general I'm pissed off with the vague gesturing at ""let's just get along"", ""let's  all  not say unkind things"". I went specific.  Bishonen  |  talk  21:46, 7 February 2007 (UTC).               Mine was made  before  he made new ones. He should be blocked, since he went on after a warning to  two  attacks. One was aimed at you -- suggesting that you're Giano's puppet/and/or a bad administrator. Had I been able to sign in today, I'd have blocked him for that one. I was specific in referring to a specific edit of his, but it's clear that he's popping his cork entirely. My problem is, as you know, that I don't believe in blocking anyone for ""personal attacks,"" but, given the way that the FAR is sidetracked, if not derailed into ""What's bugging him,"" that's pretty disruptive. Everyone else has tried to address other matters, but he's going out of his way to disrupt the function of the page, so that's where I  will  block someone, only slowly.  Geogre  02:30, 8 February 2007 (UTC)           Paul corrected me. In fact, his last nasty was before my warning, so at least I won't have to start blocking established people.

BabyDweezil  04:22, 9 February 2007 (UTC)     And please review the recent spate of edits by said complainant above, who is going around spreading vandalism, removing text as well as sourced citations from articles, without consensus or discussion of any kind on talk pages. Seems to be a pattern...  Smee  04:23, 9 February 2007 (UTC).     Hi Bishonen, here are some new edits by BD...     Deleted the same ELs that he had deleted previously  [9] .   His comment in response to my protest  [10] .   Deleted the statement ""This was in contradiction with police reports that had discovered at Aum's main compound in March, of a sophisticated chemical weapons laboratory that was capable of producing thousands of kilograms a year of the poison."" [11] .   Another deletion  [12] .     * Deletion of an EL  [13] .  Oops, that was only a move.  Tanaats  05:20, 9 February 2007 (UTC)         About  Keith Henson  (I'll get to the rest later): BabyDweezil, I hope you've noticed that I'm in no hurry to label editing ""vandalism"" as long as it can possibly be construed as good faith. But carpet-bombing the article with {{fact}} tags as in  this edit , including (for god's sake) the basic summary in the introduction,  is  IMO nothing less than vandalism. Please tell me what exactly in the intro you consider unreferenced, for instance. You're disrupting  Keith Henson  and heading for another block. As for Smeelgova, I would  still  advise him aginst using the word ""vandalism"" in edit summaries. It's a good principle.  Bishonen  |  talk  05:18, 9 February 2007 (UTC).                   Bishonen , have you read  Keith Henson ? Can yuo honestly tell me that that isn't perhaps the most extreme form of POV pushing, original research unsourced, overblown relative to importance personal essays masquerading as a biography on Wikipedia. It's so bad it's laughable, and some I'm vandalizing it by adding fact tags and removing pointless references that have nothing to do with, and source no claims in the article?  BabyDweezil  08:22, 9 February 2007 (UTC)               Duly noted, thank you I will take your advice under consideration. Here is some more evidence for youÂ :  DIFF  Yours,  Smee  06:05, 9 February 2007 (UTC).       Re-deletion of ""This was in contradiction with police reports that had discovered at Aum's main compound in March, of a sophisticated chemical weapons laboratory that was capable of producing thousands of kilograms a year of the poison."" [14] .  Tanaats  06:14, 9 February 2007 (UTC)       Lengthy PA [15] .  Tanaats  19:55, 9 February 2007 (UTC)       Defense of his prior deletion of ""This was in contradiction with..."" (see above). [16] . He is correct that the first few words were OR'ish, but he should have edited it rather than delete it. His consistent argument for many of his deletions is that it is not his job to fix things.  Tanaats  20:54, 9 February 2007 (UTC)       [ edit ]   I'm sorry   I'm sorry for what I said, and got the wrong end of the stick. I still don't see why you keep sticking up for Giano, as I've found him to be incredibly obnoxious to be honest, although I jumped the gun before he got the first punch in. This stems from the Palladian FAR, which I still don't feel should've been closed (but that's another story).   Anyway, as concerns your conduct as an admin which I got the wrong stick about... after the Palladian FAR, a few Wikipedians I don't speak to emailed me and said I'm best off steering clear of Giano and friends of his, and yourself was named. I'm not going to say what people emailed me, as they aired their views privately and I don't wish to lay the blame elsewhere as concerns what I said. Anyway, I browsed Giano's edit history, and there was some spat with a user called David something (Gerard possibly?) and another incident with Ideogram where you reported Ideogram's before - and well, thought, it must be correct then. And when I saw somewhere you'd unblocked Giano, I thought it must be true. I also figured that should someone annoy Giano, you'd get involved, and then they'd end up getting blocked. To be honest, I know admins can block people, but not much else. People are talking about IRC (Marskell tried explaining what it is a little, but I still haven't a clue what it is), de-sysopping (I don't know what this is, but I'm assuming it's where one would be stripped of their powers), RFA (??) and other things - I'm just a person who edits the odd article and hangs around at FAR, so I don't understand this language much. At the time, when I said what I said what I did I felt it to be true in my heart - I'd never knowingly say something false about a person, as I'm not that kind of person. I've since had time to consider what I said, and make more thorough inquiries into what I said. I feel really bad about the whole mess, and am extremely sorry for any offense or upset I may have caused you. If anyone questions your admin integrity in future based on this incident, I encourage you to email me and I'll back you up.   I'm extremely sorry the offer to accept an apology has expired, but I found the deluge of messages from various people (excluding yourself) on my page rather disturbing and frankly a little upsetting to be honest. It hurt, so my defense mechanism kicked in, and I'm sorry about that. I feel this is an issue between myself and you, and not all the other people who've left numerous messages on my page. While the situation is grave and rather serious, I don't feel they're helping the situation either. I'll admit that I'll never win a popularity contest on Wikipedia, but I thought other Wikipedians thought I was at least ok. It seems I'm not much liked though apparently, which I'm to mostly blame for really.   This isn't an attempt to lay the blame anywhere else, as I found your reply rather gracious under the circumstances. It took me by surprise really, as I'd found the incident a volatile situation from other quarters. It was commendable of you to keep level headed, and made me think twice of my previous judgment.   I wish for my apology to be seen as a sincere one, and not something that has been pressured out of me by the community. I'm not an insincere person believe it or not, and never have been. I don't wish to start now, but this apology is genuine. It comes from the bottom of my heart, and I hope you can accept it in that way. Anyway, I hope you take care, and really hope that you'll eventually find me to be a nice enough person, and not the one you may find me to be at present. Goodbye.  LuciferMorgan  22:27, 9 February 2007 (UTC)     I appreciate your apology, Lucifer, though not your lack of value for the work Giano does for Wikipedia. Perhaps you should do your own research in that quarter, too, and not take everything you read in hostile e-mails for gospel. Please consider that with messages from people you don't know, you also don't know their motives. Best wishes,  Bishonen  |  talk  01:21, 10 February 2007 (UTC)            ....and so yet another Wikipedia editor bites the dust, having been drip fed poison. I visit FARC very seldom only when an article in which I have taken a long standing interest is deposited there. My sole encounters with Lucifer before the current review were on Palladian architecture's review (I wrote it - I have a right to be interested in it)  [17]  where Lucifer became more and more agitated and hostile in his comments. we now know why:  [18]  "" a few Wikipedians I don't speak to emailed me and said I'm best off steering clear of Giano and friends "" obviously was the cause of such comments out of the blue as this one  [19]  . The sad thing for whoever these mysterious people are who primed Lucifer is that he eventually went firing off at Bishonen who was the wrong target. Perhaps people like Sandy Georgia who make reproving comments like this  [20]  should confine themselves to addressing the root of the problem, which is those drop feeding the poison, rather than those seeking to establish, however belatedly, the truth. I hope eventually Lucifer feels able to return to the project, and when he does he is made welcome - I do though wonder how many other innocent editors minding their own business have their inboxes filled by strangers emailing unsolicited lies and venom about their own particular enemy of the day.

Hate to butt in here, but don't you think it might be helpful to place a warning on the IP editor's talk page, since this was evidently a malicious action? -  WeniWidiWiki  19:24, 11 February 2007 (UTC)     Well, I sort of don't feel like itdon't want to give the bastard a chuckle. I'm too sure that was a drive-by edit from a logged-out established user on a dynamic IP. This place depresses me sometimes.  Bishonen  |  talk  19:42, 11 February 2007 (UTC).     Me too. However because of how long this particular run of harassment has been going, I think it's best to document the actions of the user in case it comes up again. -  WeniWidiWiki  20:19, 11 February 2007 (UTC)         Strongly agree with WiniWidiWiki.

Would you be so kind as to leave this person a note explaining that I'm not a crazy person? I've bothered them while following up an OTRS complaint at  International Cultic Studies Association .  Jkelly  20:59, 11 February 2007 (UTC)     Jkelly, not only did you  never  identify yourself as an admin (although I knew it  after  you protected the page) but you  never  explained about the complaint. You only said that ""someone complained"", and that still before identifying yourself as an admin. It is not very compelling if just-another-editor says that ""someone complained"" as a reason for deleting well-sourced material.   Then you dropped that argument entirely, meaning to me that it wasn't a strong argument to begin with. You completely switched to the argument that for some reason we should not use the  ICSA 's  own  website as a reliable source for a list of who their staff was. The whole thing was incomprehensible to me.   Admittedly I have a short fuse about the unilateral deletion of well-sourced after the predations of an editor on  Cult  and  Cult apologist . But I really do need a head slap and an explanation about how your conduct was completely proper. Then, as I said before, I will apologize profusely and walk away chastened.

Please don't revert again.  Bishonen  |  talk  03:37, 14 February 2007 (UTC).     The reversion of vandalism is exempt from the 3RR.  David Levy  03:44, 14 February 2007 (UTC)           Right there behind you Bishonen... plus the improper block.  (  Netscott )  04:08, 14 February 2007 (UTC)                   Hello there, Scott. David, you're mistaken about the application of that exemption. The reversion of something you've unilaterally and disputably decided  you  regard as vandalism is not exempt from the 3RR. (""Disputably"", obviously,since it's being disputed  all over ANI  at this moment.) By no means. This is what is exempt according to the 3RR policy:   ""Reverting  simple and obvious vandalism , such as graffiti or page blanking (this  only  applies to the most simple and obvious vandalism. For other vandalism, please see  Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism  or  Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents )""   See how it doesn't fit? Italics in the original.  Bishonen  |  talk  04:45, 14 February 2007 (UTC).                           Again, I don't understand why people are citing discussion that occurred  after  the fact as though it already had occurred.  At that time , there was overwhelming consensus that these messages were harmful. So yes, I viewed the deliberate restoration of such a banner as something tantamount to simple and obvious vandalism. I'm sure that the user felt that his/her joke was funny and didn't seek to upset people, but someone adding nonsense to an article might feel the same way. The user was well aware of the fact that the banner's insertion was regarded as disruptive and barred via a guideline, and he/she chose to ignore these facts (as well as my warning, which he/she removed from his/her talk page).   Whether I was right or wrong, I honestly perceived this as a clear-cut case of deliberate disruption.  David Levy  09:15, 14 February 2007 (UTC)   I honesty perceive this as a clear-cut abuse of administrative priviledges and deliberate userspace harassment.-- Certified.Gangsta  09:17, 14 February 2007 (UTC)                                   Well, if you look at the words of the 3RR policy, I don't see that they leave much room for deciding that somethinga joke bannerquite different from the examples they give of simple and obvious vandalism is ""something  tantamount to  simple and obvious vandalism"". On the same principle, even if you feel you have such strong consensus for a recently introduced ""rule"" that it's safe to dismiss all pleas and arguments on the other side, it wouldn't have hurt you any to try to understand where they were coming fromto listen rather than dismiss out of hand, to engage rather than assume that anybody with different opinions had to be out to harm the encyclopedia. If you'd taken opposing arguments into account, I don't think it would have been that hard to figure out what kind of reaction an actual block was likely to get on ANI. I'm saying this because from the way you responded to me, I didn't get any kind of feeling of being heard or listened to.)  Bishonen  |  talk  14:59, 14 February 2007 (UTC).                                           1. I don't believe that the mere use of the joke banner constituted anything tantamount to simple vandalism. I believe that the repeated deliberate guideline violations (mostly via edits with no summaries, some of which were labeled ""minor"") and removal of a warning message did.   2. Again, I didn't ""dismiss all pleas and arguments on the other side."" Almost all of them arose  after  the fact. I  have  listened to them and repeatedly apologized for acting in a manner met with controversy (which obviously wasn't my intent).

The user has failed to show me any diff that s/he has been warned about unsing obscenities in the future, so I feel my warning was current and correct. The next time that user uses obscenities we now have a ground for blocking (hopefully that will teach that person to behave in a civil manner instead). I don't care that much if s/he removes the warnings, it only reflects bad upon that person ability to deal with criticism. What I object to is blanking  current  debates, which makes it more difficult to continue meaningful discussion. However I consider the discussion closed (the user was warned, and failed to present any coherent argument in his/her defence).-- Â Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul PiotrusÂ  | Â talkÂ   17:29, 14 February 2007 (UTC)     As an admin, you are quite capable of doing the research as to being warned previously. All you seem to be doing is going on some kind of march to attempt to get me blocked. It won't work. You should be, instead, concentrating on the current RfC that you are the topic of for your various behaviours in the past (and present). Like the pot calling the kettle black. It wasn't a debate, mind you - it wasn't a blanking. It was acknowledgement without response, period. Next time use discretion before you go off on some tirade. Serious. Be very careful on your actions. Thank you.  Rarelibra  18:49, 14 February 2007 (UTC)     Bishonen - I don't mean to bother you. I really appreciate your assistance. The problem I have with  User:Pmanderson  is that he cannot remain respectful whenever he dislikes someone. If you look at this diff  HERE , you'll see that he insinuates that I want to ""lie to the reader"". There was nowhere at all in my comments on this discussion a proposal to lie. In fact, my whole point was that we need to use the diatrics when using names (and redirect from non-diatric names) - a process that the workplace I am involved with does on a daily basis due to an international scope of work. I was also stating that a direct English translation of the name ""Stanisaw"" is ""Stanley"" (like ""Mark"" from ""Marek""). Yet user Pmanderson seems to be able to twist my words and attempt to slander me. This is what I wish to have stopped. I do not do the same with him, I expect the same respect in return. That is all.  Rarelibra  14:41, 15 February 2007 (UTC)     [ edit ]   Your banner   I'm going to start revert warring with you, and then I'm going to block you. Oh, maybe I'd better not.

But  when they rise to disruption and to a general poisoning of the climate on talkpages, it becomes something else. Did you see me warn him on his page? [27]  Meanwhile, I wish you'd stop planting templates on him. It's frowned on to use the warning templates in that way. If you feel a need to warn or reproach him (personally, I wouldn't bother any more, if I were you), then please use regular human speech. And try to chill out, Smee. It looks a lot like BabyD is  trying  to get you aggravated (remember, ""assume good faith"" doesn't mean ""I have to pretend I'm stupid""). Don't give him the pleasure.  Bishonen  |  talk  22:55, 16 February 2007 (UTC).    It would be nice if at least one admin would judge my edits on their merits, instead of incessant speculations that I'm seeking some sort of thrill or persecuting anyone. I challenge you or any admin to conclude that less than 95% of my edits are well grounded. I explain the reasons, yet I am faced with obstinate, POV-minded editors who act as a bloc to filibuster and delay even the simplest, most obvious improvements to the articles.  BabyDweezil  23:12, 16 February 2007 (UTC)    You don't seem to understand my role in this context. I purposely don't get into your  content  disputes. If I did, I would cease to be the right person to adjudicate  behavior to ""admin"" the articles, as Tanaats puts it. Incidentally, for somebody who incessantly accuses Smeelgova of ""stalking"", it's a little curious how you pop up on every page where I allude to something you're interested in, and make some perky comment.  [28]  That's classic  stalking . On another note, may I ask why you're so careless of the  BabyDweezil  account? From comments on your talk, you don't seem to care if it gets blocked, and you seem quite uninterested when I tell you that you're headed for a community ban or for arbitration. [29]  Is  BabyDweezil  a disposable identity?  Bishonen  |  talk  23:46, 16 February 2007 (UTC).                           Maybe you could consider switching roles and take a shot at evaluating content (rather than, as you chose to do on the noticeboard, my  mental health , since what appears as ""behavior"" cannot be judged with the least bit of accuracy in the absence of context. If you don't wish to, why not ask another admin to evaluate content? Seems lots of admins have opinions on behaviors, which they're all too happy to proffer at the drop of a hat, wam bam thank you mam. Looking down from WikiOlympus and pointing fingers is easy. As to my classic  [30]  stalking, since its obvious that some of you have taken it upon yourselves to not only complain incessantly about me, but to investimigate me (lotsa luck with that, and really, cc me the results) I like to keep informed about what's up if it concerns my account. Hate to be the last one to find out, y'know!  BabyDweezil  00:03, 17 February 2007 (UTC)    Apparently you haven't noticed that plenty of admins  are  criticizing your way of adding (or, more commonly, deleting) content? See, again, the ANI discussion. And ChrisO. I don't quite see what your interest is in having me do it too. I won't be so crass as to suggest you would like it if I stopped ""adminning"" the articles you care about. My rhetorical mention of ""projection"" amounts to ""evaluating your mental health"" and playing the wikishrink, does it? You know, of all your witticisms, that bit actually makes me smile.

There has been zero ADULT discussion on actual content, rather than the rules ofthe playground. And as I pointed out, ChrisO has a HUUUUUGE (big even) conflict of interest on Scientology related articles. It's like having Karl Rove jump in and admin the Dick Cheney article.

User:Sa.vakilian/AFC1  How can we banned him forever?-- Sa.vakilian  05:18, 19 February 2007 (UTC)     Hi.The thing to do in my opinion is propose a community ban on WP:ANI. (Compare my recent post there.) Link prominently to the previous thread and the reactions that people registered there. Give the new post a heading that clearly states what it's about, and that makes it easy to notice for people who have an interest in the usersay ""Community ban proposed against  Patchouli "" or something like that. See, LittleDan already said he thought a ban was appropriate, and I actually proposed a community ban, but the heading didn't say anything about a ban, so probably few people noticed it. You need to make your post easy to read and the points you make easy to grasp. Your evidence is good, but frankly, you have too much of it! (It'll be very useful if this is taken to  arbitration , as seems pretty likely.) Only use the best of your links, and  explain  what you think they prove. Mention that LittleDan and others already suggested a ban. Me, I was just talkingI don't have any experience of the userbut LittleDan is important, so you might want to ask him to post his views directly after your proposal. Preferably a little more fully than he did before.   Advice for getting people interested in the issue:    Be fair, mention if the user has some good points, or if there are any excuses for the way he behaves. Make it clear what you're proposing, but ask the readers for input and their views, rather than say ""You have to ban him.""   Be brief. Agha Nader's original post in the previous thread is a good length, and is a good pattern for you altogether (except the header, which is unhelpful), with striking examples. Yours can be shorter, since you have a recent discussion to refer to.   Don't talk about the various policies he's breaking. Administrators know what these policies are, and listing them only sounds formalistic. Instead go directly to what he's specifically done, and the amount of problems he causes.       Who should propose it? Absolutely not me, I'm ignorant. Not somebody who has edit warred a lot with Patchouli, or is any kind of extremist on the opposite side from him. Somebody knowledgeable. It sounds (from your evidence collection) like you would be a good person. So would Agha Nader, or LittleDan. It's not really important, the information and the way it's presented matters more than who it is. Finally, if there's not consensus for a community ban, I advise you to first have somebody previously uninvolved make a good-faith effort to reach out to the user, and then (assuming that fails, as seems only too likely) go directly to requesting arbitration. From the links already posted, I don't see the sense in wearing out everybody with formal mediation and/or an RFC which would only turn into a flameout anyway. Requesting arbitration isn't hard. Good luck,  Bishonen  |  talk  13:08, 19 February 2007 (UTC).

If there are legitimate points that I'm chopping off that can be made more appropriately, please feel free to put them in in a better way.

Bishonen  |  talk  04:00, 20 February 2007 (UTC).       OK, I'm still not sure. You'd have to make sure it's a limited number of peopleabsolutely not more than, say, 57 peopleand an extremely neutral message. Avoid any hint of what you'd want or expect them to say, just ask them in a very neutral way for input. The only point I feel doubt about is that it's supposed to be important to write to  both  people who agree with you and people who agree with your adversary. So, if Patchouli  has  any supporters, or people neutral on the issues, it's extremely important that you include those people. But if he doesn't, I'm honestly not sure what would be deemed acceptable. In my own opinion, though, it would hardly be reasonable to prevent you from messaging people for input in such a case. Go for it. I  think  it's ok, so feel free to blame me if anybody complains.  Bishonen  |  talk  04:20, 20 February 2007 (UTC).       [ edit ]   Personal attacks starting up again?

All pretty much invented out of whole cloth in the late 19th centurycustoms the first-generation emigrants had never heard of. People are funny, aren't they?

Andries  18:15, 1 March 2007 (UTC)     [ edit ]   Hi Bishonen,   And I'm very pleased to meet you! - Sorry to beg some of your time, but I've come to you to ask for some advice. I have what i consider serious concerns about essjay's conduct, and am upset with the way my concerns are being handled.   Brief rundown is that essjay lied on his userpage for ages about his qualifications - claiming to be a tenured professor, and hold the following degrees;     Bachelor of Arts in Religious Studies (B.A.)   Master of Arts in Religion (M.A.R.)   Doctorate of Philosophy in Theology (Ph.D.)   Doctorate in Canon Law (JCD)     I understand that some see this as no big deal (but it is a big deal to me). What i thought was far more serious was that he repeated these lies to the New Yorker, and allowed a story to be published  [34]  which I feel directly bolsters wiki's reputation based on his fictional qualifications. I'm really concerned that without recognising this behaviour as a mistake at some point this could do serious damage to wikipedia's reputation, essjay being such a high powered user - this level of dishonesty is just plain wrong.   He has justified what he refers to as disinformation here  [35]  - and basically repeated this justification when I raised it on his talk page here  [36]  - leaving aside the fact that I think essjay is needlessly mentioning stalking, police matters and harrasment (how could wiki suddenly be so safe now?), I don't feel that he's responded at all appropriately to the issues. He's made it clear now he doesn't want to talk about it...  [37]   I don't like the idea of someone who thinks this is not important having so much power. As you can see, I've become quite involved in this issue - perhaps I see it as so serious because I'm up so close - if it's no big deal, then I should let it lie, but I feel sure there's a seed of something quite important. I've sent you an email too.....  Purples  02:33, 25 February 2007 (UTC)     Hi, Purples. I'll take a look and talk with some people and get back to you. Best wishes,  Bishonen  |  talk  13:04, 25 February 2007 (UTC).           I have my usual overly-complicated view, which I've e-mailed you, Bish.  Geogre  15:22, 25 February 2007 (UTC)        That's funny - I have a theory too  Giano  15:25, 25 February 2007 (UTC)           Well, I'm on three sides of the fence.  Geogre  15:28, 25 February 2007 (UTC) (Beat that!)        Oh Geogre - it is far better to tunnel underneath the fence - who knows what one finds when one starts digging!  Giano  15:39, 25 February 2007 (UTC) (et tu)            On an  entirely unrelated matter  (and I mean that sincerely; this is not code or insinuation), I have created a new award on my talk page.  Geogre  18:34, 25 February 2007 (UTC)                       Sorry I'm feeling cold and shivery, very cold, we have a superstition in deepest Sicily, never let your name be carved on a  stone  before the appointed time. Oh hell it has my name - I can feel a sore throat coming on - you must all pray for my repose.  Giano  18:45, 25 February 2007 (UTC)    That headstone doesn't have your name on it, unless the ""Giano Affair"" was about Giano, which it wasn't. Everyone knows that.  Geogre  20:50, 25 February 2007 (UTC)        Oh but do they? Poor dear Jimbo is there too - I just don't like it - we are doomed.  Giano  21:10, 25 February 2007 (UTC)                       [ edit ]   Pass the  doilies , please   Hi. I can use a bit of advice here, please. Do you think that  this  bit by  User:Antaeus Feldspar  constitutes disruption or abuse of a noticeboard worth bringing up on AN/I. I really do not want to be ""dainty"" here (more on that in a sec). I have a pretty thick skin and am very used to being attacked on the Scientology Series talk pages. I really don't mind it much as it gives me the rare opportunity to crack extremely wise and that is not something I do in real life or in other areas here. Lately, though, this crap has been spilling over onto admin noticeboards. There was my dainty 5RR with Smee and Tanaats try there (which he, to his credit, had the good sense to remove after I asked him to), then Orsini and Anteaus on your AN/I on BD, and now this one. Those are the recent ones. Basically, it is taking a noticeboard case and turning it into ""get Justanother"" on the hope that some admin will buy into their ""stuff"". This type of activity is off-topic anywhere (if they have a case let them just bring it) but seems especially egregious on the noticeboards. I mean, does Antaeus really think an editor/admin is going to want to jump into that to figure out and answer whatever on-point question is in there? I already figured out (finally) what his argument was and responded to it. I really wish these guys would stop it already and that is my only desired outcome. As regards ""dainty"". Yes, sure. But I think BD was already well ""under control"" and Smee was running over my valid edits at the same time in his edit-warring. Smee has said that he will make the necessary adjustments to his editing style and I have made efforts to patch things up between he and I. Thanks for your input on this Antaeus thing, I respect it. -- Justanother  16:30, 25 February 2007 (UTC)     OMG. I've read through the BLP noticeboard thread once and am none the wiser. Frankly I'm stupider. Antaeus Feldspar's posts are rather long and complicated; yours are  dreadfully  long and complicated. You'll have to apply your own unaided judgement as to whether to take it to ANI, because I can't even tell what's going on. But if you do, consider this: I react with incomprehension and frustration. So does William Thweatt  [38] . That's two out of two. There are currently no other comments. What kind of response do you think you'll get if you write like that on ANI, where the competition for admins' attention is so fierce? People are put off by long paragraphs, so please be brief; people don't know the background, so please explain it. These two suggestions are admittedly in dynamic tension with each other. But still.  Bishonen  |  talk  20:08, 25 February 2007 (UTC).           Yes, thanks for the advice. And I do apologize for sticking your nose in that. Though I do object (in good-natured manner) to your claiming that I was more long-winded than Antaeus. I broke out the calculator and, prior to Mr. Thweatt, Antaeus was at 56.3% and me at a ""mere"" 43.7%, but there were just the two of us (smile). And I certainly hope I was more entertaining (but maybe not). My problem is that I have been attacked since I got here in August 2006, just because I am a Scientologist and, while it has been an educational experience and ""trial by fire"", I am pretty much done now with being attacked, especially as it is seeping over to the notice boards and I imagine that I will be using them to actually get some help from experienced editors like Mr. Thweatt (and yourself) and I am tired of the character assassination employed against me (such as Orsini's that I am a troll and an  OSA stooge ). If I do decide to pursue it I will be sure to give my sardonic rhetoric a rest. Which I am quite capable of doing. -- Justanother  20:55, 25 February 2007 (UTC)    OK, I did the best I could and posted it to AN/I. Your comments, of course, are welcome. Thanks -- Justanother  05:36, 28 February 2007 (UTC)    Dang, despite my best efforts some rhetoric crept in to my posting on AN/I but I have removed it. ""Old habits die hard."" -- Justanother  13:43, 28 February 2007 (UTC)                   [ edit ]   Coding   Just as you've done it. With the refs spelled out, it's a cinch.  Marskell  13:20, 27 February 2007 (UTC)     You've merged my notes, I see. No big deal, but I thought those sentences deserved separate citing, as the theatre company history is quite esoteric knowledge. The details about the ""adventurers"" and about the actors' cooperative are only available in Milhous' book as far as I know, and are on a whole different level from the surrounding paragraph about how the 1690s drama was different from the 1670s, which is 100% known and assented to by everybody who's written on the drama in the past 400 years, and doesn't deserve any citing at all. Milhous lays out two separate things, though connected: the early-robber-baron-raw-capitalism that gutted the company (pp. 3743), and the (unique, startling) reaction of the actors, who fought back by setting up their own cooperative and revitalizing London theatre life (5168).  Bishonen  |  talk  14:39, 27 February 2007 (UTC).    To come down on the other side of our long debate, I was worried two separate cites in adjoining sentences might encourage the  [ citation needed ]  every two lines problem. While I do ask for sources at times, I'm certainly not in that camp. What about summation in the cite, briefly detailing what you've just said above and pointing to the page numbers?  Marskell  14:56, 27 February 2007 (UTC)    I've gone ahead and  done so .  Marskell  18:21, 27 February 2007 (UTC)               [ edit ]   Thanks   ...for your thoughts at  User talk:Kosebamse/Wikipedia is not a sentient being ; a little further discussion is on that page. Always delighted to hear from you,  Kosebamse  20:10, 27 February 2007 (UTC)     [ edit ]   here we go....   i think the ethics stuff is beginning to get noticed....  [39]  - I gather the New Yorker has also published a correction (it's quoted in that blog..). The fact that essjay was to some degree representing wikpedia when talking to the New Yorker is what causes the damage..... just thought i'd let you know...  Purples  00:38, 28 February 2007 (UTC)     And isn't this the same user who was just appointed to ArbCom by the direct order of Jimbo skipping a step of obtaining community's feedback on that while users who passed the voting with >70% threshold were readily available? Where is this all going? -- Irpen  01:07, 28 February 2007 (UTC)     (Come on, Irpen, please hold the rhetorical questionswhat good do you think they're going to do?) Very interesting, Purples. It certainly vindicates  you , though I don't suppose it makes you happy.Â :-( Anyway, I hope the users who piled on you for ""trolling"" feel at least slightly foolish, when or if they see that article.  Bishonen  |  talk  01:35, 28 February 2007 (UTC).   Actually I understand where they're coming from - they respect essjay enormously, and want to help 'defend' him - that's cool, just a little misguided. All i really want to do is engage the chap at the centre of it all.  Purples  01:43, 28 February 2007 (UTC)     I think that this is a project filled with paper dolls. These paper dolls ... people can think either that they represent a person or that they are paper dolls in their own right. It bugs me when anyone tries to embue his or her creature with aspects of a real person. I do not want to have this one say that it has rights and abilities because the person manipulating it has gotten a Ph.D. in web comics, and I do not want to have that one say that it has extra powers because the person manipulating it was a lawyer or judge. Any time that happens, I think the fundamental basis of Wikipedia is being broken. We're either anonymous editors, or we are not, and I loathe the idea of trying to have it both ways. When a person not only tries to make the fiction of the person on Wikipedia refer to the human fictionalizer, but also lets the paper doll step out of the book and  equal  the person, I'm doubly irritated.   It's easy for me to ignore LordViperScropion's claims to being Brad Pitt. However, when he tries to say that Brad Pitt has the qualities of the avatar and the avatar the qualities of the actor, it's a special kind of offense. If Essjay said he were the Pope, I'd say that means nothing, because all the identities here are presumed to be fiction, but if he says he's the Pope and therefore is the leader of all Catholics who edit Wikipedia, he's being a jerk. If he then goes on to a real world interview  as  the Pope, it's probably at the level of fraud, at least intellectual fraud.   There is no way to explain to the folks of  The New Yorker  how the fictions of Wikipedia appeal to those carrying particularly large social wounds, how the most lofty personalities as personalities are often those whose frustrations at reality are greatest, how the least spectacular personalities are often those who really have accomplishments.  Geogre  11:59, 28 February 2007 (UTC)     I thought i'd copy below a message that i received (hope that's not considered rude...) because Geogre and Ancheta seem to me to have the deepest understanding of the bigger wiki issues, and I thank you both for your insights....   It's all kicking off at Jimbo's talk page now, so I think I'll take a step back. I do think it's a shame that essjay didn't just take the opportunity to put a little correction on the record.... ho hum....   Purples  23:21, 28 February 2007 (UTC)     What worries me is that these are not creatures who deceive to survive, but rather that there is a deception (the electronic self) that is particularly attractive to those who have the greatest deficit in their feelings. I don't want to care about the  Wound and the Bow,  as it were, don't want to care about this, either way, because only the product matters. If a forger makes a Da Vinci, I'm ok with owning it, so long as I don't pass it off as a Da Vinci: it has all the pleasures of the creation and lacks only the originality. What bothers me is that I think we've been handed a  Summa Theologica  written by Tommy A. Quines and asked to treat it as by Thomas Aquinas. The game is unequal. George has told Martha that Sonny Jim was killed. The illusion is shattered by trying to take it out of the social contract that licensed it (the deceit that is electronic self).  Geogre  02:27, 1 March 2007 (UTC)     ... i think this is where realism comes in. We should not be surprised when people behave unethically, or when they find it hard to understand why others think they're wrong. Or to put it another way, everybody lies. Just a fact of life. I think your point about having it both ways here is very important though - wikipedia seems to engage needy people hugely, who then go through a cycle of feeling excited, empowered, frustrated then embittered - then wipe the slate clean and start again. The clutter talk of wiki-love and making the world a better place doesn't help.   I'm worried that people with serious, real life issues, both acute and chronic come here, get confused about their relationship to their computer screens, and end up getting hurt. There's a argument going on about clerks over at checkuser at the moment - it seems to me that someone has handed out badges, which become badges of first wiki, then self-esteem generally. Of course it's upsetting when someone suggests that your self-esteem is unneccessary - except it's not your self-esteem, it's only an imaginary badge. People handing out the badges bear some responsibility.   To bring these abstractions back to the nitty-gritty, essjay should simply stand down from his arb com, checkuser and oversight responsibilities, put an apology on the record and get on with everything he enjoys around here. If he finds this terribly hard, he should ask himself why....   Purples  03:07, 1 March 2007 (UTC)     ""clutter talk of wiki-love""? As you saying that Wikipedians need not try to be nice to each other?       No-one ever gives me a badge. I still have the cuddy rhino, though. --  ALoan   (Talk)  12:12, 1 March 2007 (UTC)     Oh no, we should all be nice to each other - I just find some users a bit zealous beyond reason in their wiki-faith. I'm trying to make a joke about a horn here, but you'll have to figure one out for yourselves..... ps. it's sad to see this thing explode - signal to noise ratio is not good. happy days all! -  Purples  06:24, 2 March 2007 (UTC)     [ edit ]   idealism, naturalism, empiricism, and realism (a message from Ancheta to Purples....)   (please see above para... and delete with apologies if considered clutter....)   P., I reply with a philosophical answer, which you may take as you please.   There is a beautiful street in my neighborhood, a quiet one, nicely proportioned, of just the right width and length, with mature trees, nice-looking houses, children who play on its lawns, and neighbors. Once, when driving slowly along it (so as not to alarm the children) I saw a couple speaking to each other. The woman, whom I believe to be the wife, was standing on a large rock, that she might tower over the man, and she appeared to be gesturing in a power-demanding way to the man. This disturbed me, as I have the illusion that those who live on that street have wonderful lives. Clearly, I have an ideal, about that street and life, which rests in my heart.   Although I have these ideals, the love of Nature and all its power lies in my heart as well, so that I understand that the mystery and beauty inherent in N. sometimes has no room for the demands of Man. Thus there are beings in Nature who deceive simply to survive, and their lives are testament to a Nature who lets them be. They exist and survive.   I was trained to respect  empiricism  because that is at the root of the power of our civilization, but  realism  probably enjoys a better-founded set of concepts. So I believe that your principled outrage at a being who has deceived, survived, and who has even found a better  gig  in his existence, may be a stage in the process of     Coping with Grief and Loss  -- Common reactions. --  Elizabeth Kubler-Ross     Denial/shock  It can't be   Anger toward the person, situation or self   Guilt -  If only ...   Depression, Loneliness, Facing death, etc.   Relief   Hope   Return         So the outing of _ has me personally at #4. But I expect my feelings will transmute. I admit to reacting with #1. I do not feel a need to forgive, because I never felt #2. -- Ancheta Wis  18:27, 28 February 2007 (UTC)   And the street to which I referred above might be taken as a metaphor for Wikipedia. My references to Nature and Reality stand on their own.     Better to say nothing that to lie, I should have thought - it is not as if anything needed to be said in the first place. --  ALoan   (Talk)  12:15, 1 March 2007 (UTC)         [ edit ]   Your opinion (and anyone elses)   On your screen on which version is the lettering of the key cleare this  [40]  or this  [41]  - i wish I knew how to do these things properly!

Just wanted to apologize again more personally for that accusation on AN:I. It's been a rough coupla months on-wiki and off, and I guess I've been snapping a little. I don't remember who it was I was thinking of, but it was a prominent administrator, and they said they were 'disgusted' by my conduct, and that they would 'gladly recommend my DeSysoping to the ArbCom personally'. Not the most pleasant thing in the world to hear. I remember our interactions now on the topic of another bothersome user, and I apologize for mistaking you for someone else. Luckily, I've put myself on Administrative 'light duty' for the next term or two to get a nice, cleansing break from all of the warring. No harm done? -- InShaneee  06:00, 3 March 2007 (UTC)     No, not at all, InShaneee. Of course not. I remember two separate bothersome users we've had dealings with together... one too smart for his own good and the other, er, just the oppositeI don't know if those descriptions are enough for you to recall the people! What's light duty--no blocking? I took myself off admin duty altogether once, all the buttons, outraged that  one of our best admins  had been de-adminned from on high, most unfairly as I thought. That turned out to be a fine opportunity to write a full-scale article, for once. Hope you return refreshed after the light duty! It  is  only a website, after all. Best,  Bishonen  |  talk  12:55, 3 March 2007 (UTC).    For me, 'light duty' is simply not getting into any pre-existing disputes...and by that, I mean distancing myself from the various Kurd/Turk debates. There's still a lot that needs to be done there, but I know another admin has stepped in for the time being, so I feel a little more comfortable letting it go for a time. Currently? I'm rediscovering my love of New Page PatrolÂ :) . And hey, good to see you're turned your outrage into opportunity. This is just a website, but I think the reason we're all here is because we know it can be more than that.

I'm posting stuff at Wikipedia when I really need to be writing my paper. In order to reduce the temptation for me to get involved, would you do me a favour and add  User talk:GordonWatts  to your watchlist. You'll remember Gordon's incredibly ill-judged self nomination for adminship over a year ago, and actually I'm turning to you mainly because you opposed him at the time, and were challenged lengthily, so you know what he's like, and couldn't be accused of unduly favouring him, but at the same time, I know you have a strong sense of allowing blocked users some dignity.   Gordon is a well-meaning editor, who hasn't a clue how to get along with people who disagree with him, and doesn't make the effort to try to get along with them. He posts hundreds of words, often in different colours to draw attention to them. And he has to argue on every little point. However, his article edits are often helpful, improving word flow, correcting inaccuracies (whether Terri Schiavo was in a hospice or a hospital on a certain date), fixing spelling errors, etc. Unfortunately, he has tried very hard to get links to his own websites put in to the article, and got upset at the opposition, which included a lot of completely unnecessary rudeness and belittling. A community ban was sought, and he argued with everyone, even those who were trying to help him, and posted thousands of words, getting quite disruptive, and lost a lot of the support that he originally had. The ban vote was closed incorrectly, as the community had mostly said either that he couldn't go near anything to do with Terri Schiavo, or that he could edit the Schiavo articles but only post once a day on the Schiavo talk pages. He was told that he couldn't edit the articles, and could post once a day on the talk pages  something which nobody had voted for. He then filed an arbitration case against all the people who had voted against him, and started arguing and wiki-lawyering with the arbitrators. Then he appealed to Jimbo, and was blocked indefinitely for disruption. There was some very bad-taste gloating. [42]   [43]   The indefinite block was reduced to a month, but he's still able to edit his talk page, and is still reacting there. He's in danger of being permanently blocked if he mentions his links again, and I don't actually think he'll do it if nobody provokes him by telling him that they're not suitable. He has accepted that the consensus is that he may not add them to articles, and in any case, he doesn't have any greater history of edit warring than other people on the Terri Schiavo article. However, I'm worried that he's going to respond to posts where people tell him that he's not to mention his links, and that it may be used against him to make the block permanent.   In case you're interested, there's discussion  here  and  here . There's also a longish post from me  here , which is cross-posted from TenOfAllTrades's talk page. Don't feel under any obligation to wade through any of it, though, as I'm not asking you to unblock Gordon or to ""vote"" in any discussion. All I'm asking is that you'd keep an eye on his talk page, and discourage people from posting anything that will make him feel he has to respond. (And poor Gordon feels he has to respond to  everything !) If people keep up the arguments on his talk page, he'll argue back, saying why they're wrong to say he can't talk about his links, and then it's quite likely that someone will block him for talking about them. But if everyone leaves him alone, and stops mentioning his links even on other pages that he watches, there's a reasonable chance that he'll stop mentioning them. He has already said he'll stop, but he's just not able to  not  repond when someone argues with him. I've seen you dealing quite kindly and tactfully with people who had trouble ""letting go"" before. I think I'll ask GTBacchus to watch that talk page as well. I'm really not asking for any action: this could be one of the cases where doing nothing is the best possible solution. I'd just like to think that a few people who are not interested in trampling on people's dignity would be watching his page. Thanks.  Musical L inguist  15:58, 5 March 2007 (UTC)     Don't worry that you don't have the tact for the job. You don't need a lot of tact. Gordon, contrary to what you might think, is not huffy. He once gave a barnstar to  an editor  who had called him an asshole and a certifiable nutjob, and had said he needed his ass kicked, plus lots of other similar things. And  my recent post to him  isn't exactly full of compliments, but he e-mailed me and thanked me. Anyway, if you feel ""a great wave of, hmm,  impatience "" engulfing you, you can't do better than think of  Saint Thrse of Lisieux , who describes in her journal/autobiography how someone was infuriating her, complaining, nagging, finding fault, etc., and Thrse listened in silence, and then, before leaving the room, did one more thing.  ""I gave her my best smile.""  My mother always used to quote that  as a joke, not as an attempt to preach!       Seriously, though, I think there's a problem if people start goading a blocked user by telling him on his talk page that he's not to mention his links, and then threaten him with an indefinite block if he answers, on his talk page, that he doesn't think that's fair, or that he doesn't  need  Wikipedia to link to his websites, because he gets plenty of hits anyway. I'm all for increasing a block when a blocked user spends his block time by filling his talk page with ""[Name of blocking admin] likes to rape little boys"". But if we don't have the self control not to insist on having the last word, why should we expect him to? You said something wonderful months ago about how admins are more powerful than users, but  so  much more powerful than blocked users, and that a sensitive awareness of that should make us tolerant of what blocked users say when they're blocked. I can't remember the context, or where you said it, but I'm annoyed I didn't make a note of the diff at the time. because it was one of the best posts I've ever seen. It's the reason I though of you when making the request. <groan> Anyway, Gordon hasn't posted in the last few days, and I have some hope that he'll follow the advice I gave him,  if people don't provoke him . If they do, I have absolutely no hope at all that he'll be able to ignore them.       Important note:  the ""best smile"" advice is intended strictly for Bishonen, and perhaps for some other  humans  reading this post. I do  not  recommend that Bishzilla try giving ""her best smile"". I think it would be far more scary than her frown. (Has anyone ever seen her best smile and lived?) <flees in terror at the thought of Bishzilla's best smile>  Musical L inguist  12:10, 9 March 2007 (UTC)       [ edit ]   Archiving   I am starting the think that my early archiving [44] [45]  of our previous discussion gave the impression of a dismissal of your views. It was not my intent to dismiss your concerns.   Directly before this dispute, I decided to take a wikibreak due unrelated issues. My intent was to keep my talk page clear. I gave the edit summary to indicate that I was archiving it and that it was being addressed on  WP:ANI . I was not trying to snub you, and I am sorry if that is how it came across.   My wikibreak is not related to this issue, rather I am making an exception to my wikibreak to deal with it. No hard feelings, we can disagree, but we need to remember that we are both working towards what we think is best for Wikipedia.  High InBC   (Need help?  Ask me )  18:42, 5 March 2007 (UTC)     You know, I hear that cannibis can really fuck with your wits. Could that be the problem here? Bishonen  clearly  doesn't want you harassing her here.

My pre-archiving has been explained, and I thank you not to attribute motives to me like that. I have received a lot of hostility, and I have myself been a little uncivil, I was attempting to apologize for that.               I appreciate your opinion, but I don't think it is in line with my motives of easing any hard feelings that may of accumulated.  High InBC   (Need help?

He's repeatedly trying to add an unsourced and disputed claim into  Michelle Marsh (model) , he's accused me and another editor of stalking when we've reverted him, and he is going around making edits to the effect that the Taiwanese aren't ethnically Chinese on all sorts of pages. It's gotten to the stage where more of his edits are reverted than kept, and by a wide range of editors. He's sticking to the letter of 3RR, but not the spirit. I don't think he's deliberately trolling, but the end effect is still disruptive. For his sake, can you have a talk to him? Thanks,  Ben Aveling  21:16, 5 March 2007 (UTC)     I was just going to, I've got his page watchlisted. It's just everybody at the same time... I mean, Gordon... yikes.

That would be nice. I'll take another look tomorrow. Yaaaawn...  Bishonen  |  talk  01:50, 6 March 2007 (UTC).    Hey Bishy, how's it going?? Sorry about that Michelle March episode, I did a quick google search and hopefully it will be resolved. As for the Taiwan vs. China situation, enough had been said about that. On a side note, I was hoping you can get in touch with Ben and help resolve our differences. I mean, no offense, but he seems a lil hostile toward me ever since we decided to block Guardian Tiger. ThankzÂ :)-- Certified.Gangsta  05:44, 6 March 2007 (UTC)    Hello, Gangsta, I hear you're a boob man! Seriously,  this  ... what a sight. I'm glad to hear that's all over. And it's good to see you around. People are leaving your Bishzilla banner alone, I trust. But, er... I hope you realize what horrors the banner link can lead your unsuspecting visitors into? Did you, in fact... <gulp> ... did you CLICK on it, CG...? Best not, believe me.  Bishonen  |  talk  08:33, 6 March 2007 (UTC).                     hahaha you're hilarious, bish.

[ edit ]   RFC minor formatting     Could you maybe help  User:Anynobody  with some minor formatting/procedural issues at  Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Anynobody and Justanother ? I am not entirely familiar with the RFC formatting and procedure, as a specific RFC to users and not articles. Thank you for your time.  Smee  00:46, 6 March 2007 (UTC).           I don't blame you. It's quite misleading that user RFCs and article RFCs even share a name, as they function and are formatted quite differently. The most important thing about user RFCs is right at the top of the template: there must be a co-signer of the RFC, somebody who has attempted (independently of Anynobody) to resolve the issues with JA. Both Anynobody and the other editor must sign,  and provide evidence of their efforts to resolve the problem  within 48 hours of creating the RFC. Evidence means diffs. Everything else can pretty much wait, but the 48-hour thing is obligatory, and if it's not complied with, the RFC is highly likely to be deleted as soon as the 48 hours are up.               What I'd prefer to do is move the page into Anynobody's own space, in other words give it a name of the form  User:Anynobody/Requests for comment/Justanother ; stop the people who have already been asked to comment; move it back into Wikipedia space later, when it's a bit more ready to meet the world; and start those 48 hours then instead of now. OK? Then I could give some help and advice tomorrow, as I'm about to go to bed right now. (Such is my timezone.) If you reply now right  nowI can move the page; if not, please confer with A and move it yourself if you know how (it's easy), or ask any experienced user. For instance one of the freaks that hang out at this page of mine. And don't list it on  Wikipedia:Requests for comment/User conduct  yet!  Bishonen  |  talk  01:43, 6 March 2007 (UTC).    Did not get to your comment early enough, but added myself as a party and some evidence. Let myself or  User:Anynobody  know how it looks/what should be done at this point... Also, what is the best way to notify previously involved parties about the existence of the page in a neutral manner?  Smee  16:12, 6 March 2007 (UTC).             Well... I'm actually a little frustrated that you asked my advice and then ignored it. Changing the page into a userpage until it's ready is the way to go IMO, especially because then there'll be time to deal properly with the ""dispute resolution"" thing. Changing it into a userpage can be done any time as long as nobody has commented, after that it'll be too late. But never mind, this is what to do with an RFC that's already in Wikipedia space (=has a name beginning with ""Wikipedia""):     The name of the page should be  Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Justanother . This is standard, and Anynobody, who's making the request, isn't supposed to be in the title.   The page must be listed and linked on  Wikipedia:Requests for comment/User conduct .   About notifying people, that's a little delicate, indeed. The only person who must be notified, and perhaps the only one who should be, is Justanother. If you want to spread the news, you obviously have to be careful not to simply notify people who have issues with Justanother. Not sure what you mean by ""previously involved"". Involved in what? Anynobody seems to be asking for comments on the way the two of them have been interactinghow is anybody else involved in that?   The links at ""Evidence of trying and failing to resolve the dispute"" are no good, to put it brutally. Posting warning templates on JA's page certainly doesn't qualify as attempted dispute resolution. (Didn't I tell you once that it was frowned on?) Dispute resolution means a bona fide attempt at reaching out, and I think you may be too upset with JA to be the best person for it. Suggestion: try asking Jossi, who knows the ropes, to contact JA and try to talk with him about Anynobody's concerns. (Yes, I know there's little time for that... people do tend to run short of time at this point. The way it's looking now, practically any admin will delete the page after 48 hours, if JA requests it.) A technical point, also: the top 3 links under ""Evidence of trying and failing to resolve the dispute"" don't work, and I think there are some more on the page that don't. You need html links for talkpage sections, and you need permanent links, that'll still point to the same section after the page itself is archived or whatever. And, as the instructions say, linking to a whole page isn't useful. I can easily format the links so they work right if you like (just ask), but you do need to have better dispute resolution to point to.   I don't think Anynobody should put his reason for making the request on the talkpage, it should be on the main page. Under ""Statement of the dispute"", perhaps, or ""Description"". (It's a very nice explanationit's good to see a RFC that's not full of acrimony and it's-all-his-fault but it would be even better if it was a little shorter.)   Finally, I'm sorry it's such a bureaucratic nightmare. You probably weren't expecting that. User RFC's are horrible timesinks.Â :-(  Bishonen  |  talk  00:53, 7 March 2007 (UTC).       [ edit ]   My apologies.     Well... I'm actually a little frustrated that you asked my advice and then ignored it.  - Please understand that I had started to add to the RFC, upon request from  User:Anynobody ,  before  I had seen your suggestions, so I did  not  ""ignore"" your suggestions, it was just too late. At any rate, I will try to implement some of your suggestions now. Please bear with me, as you are correct - I am unfamiliar with this process. If you feel you can adjust the page, be my guest.  Smee  00:59, 7 March 2007 (UTC).    I have notified  User:Jossi  as per your suggestion and asked for help.  DIFF  If you think you can fix some of the links on the RFC page, and/or fix it to be more appropriate, that would be most helpful.  Smee  01:05, 7 March 2007 (UTC).    Also, can an editor list/link at  Wikipedia:Requests for comment/User conduct  or is that an Admin's job? How is the proper way to do this?  Smee  01:06, 7 March 2007 (UTC).                       "" Changing it into a userpage can be done any time as long as nobody has commented, after that it'll be too late. "" Nobody has commented, so I can still  userfy  it to give you more time for dispute resolution. Shall I do that, or do you think you can have it done up right within the 48 hours? I won't do a technical fix of the links at this stage, as I think you need links to better places. Good that you pinged Jossi. Anybody can list the page, but if you do want the page userfied, it shouldn't be listed yet.  Bishonen  |  talk  01:21, 7 March 2007 (UTC).    I am not opposed to userfying the page, but  User:Anynobody  started the RFC initially, I was just responding to his request that I add comments/evidence. If you or Anynobody wishes to do that - I have no objection - but I probably should not.  Smee  01:23, 7 March 2007 (UTC).    Oh, I'd better not, then, I assumed you two were in touch. But I've moved A's explanation from the talkpage to the project page. Please let him know that he should sign it, if you speak  no reason to make the reader dig around for who is bringing the RFC.  Bishonen  |  talk  01:34, 7 March 2007 (UTC).    I wouldn't know any more than you. I've only ""spoken"" to him through Wikipedia talk pages. But I will let him know if I do. Again, as  User:Anynobody  started the RFC, and not myself, as far as I am concerned your judgment is fine.  Smee  01:44, 7 March 2007 (UTC).                         I'm really sorry to cause so much trouble on both of your parts, rest assured I'm learning. Also please understand I am very thankful for your help. Maybe an RfC was the wrong road for me to take? Essentially I'd like other editors to take a look at my interaction with  User:Justanother . I honestly don't know if I'm wrong or right, so my intention in listing myself was making it clear I'm willing to accept accountability for any errors I've made.  Anynobody  02:29, 7 March 2007 (UTC) To be clear I'm happy to accept any suggestions.  Anynobody  03:12, 7 March 2007 (UTC)     Better than an RfC, that as Bishonen put it are ""horrible timesinks"" (an opinion that I also share), would you consider informal mediation between you and Justanother? Sometimes having such a third-party assisting can really help in disputes such as this.   jossi    (talk)  06:26, 7 March 2007 (UTC)     To be honest I did consider mediation at first, but personally I'd like to hear from several editors. If I understand what  Bishonen  is proposing, it would be to move the page as is to a subpage under my userpage. Once it gets a few comments, then move it back to the RfC? If that's what the proposal is I have no objections.  Anynobody  06:57, 7 March 2007 (UTC)         No, not ""once it gets a few comments"". It won't get comments while it's in your userspace, that's the whole point. It won't  start  until it's moved back to a live RFC, and, on my reading of the always-vexed RFC rules, you would be able to restart the clock for those 48 hours when it was moved back. What you need the time for is dispute resolution. The rule is that there must be real attempts, by two people, to resolve differences with JA, or the RFC gets deleted. It doesn't have to be formal mediation, informal is fine, but it must be a real discussionnot scolding JA with warning templates and such. Of course the hope is that the mediation will be enough in itself, and the RFC become superfluouscompare Jossi's comment here. But if it isn't enough, it's in any case a  prerequsite  for the RFC. OK, I've gone ahead and moved the page into your userspace as  User:Anynobody/Requests for comment/Justanother .  Bishonen  |  talk  11:07, 7 March 2007 (UTC).         A quick question before this goes any further, did it really seem like I was posting warning templates and scolding him?  Anynobody  21:42, 7 March 2007 (UTC)         No, IMO your attempts were ok, I was talking about Smee's. "" There must be real attempts, by *two people*, to resolve differences with JA "". See the top of the RFC template: ""at least *two people* need to show that they tried to resolve a dispute with this user and have failed"". You're only one.  Bishonen  |  talk  07:31, 8 March 2007 (UTC).         Thank you for your reply, I'm sorry if that last question seemed blunt but what you were describing is exactly the kind of thing I meant to avoid. Considering that I didn't mean to create a situation where an RfC was necessary, for a little while I thought I was  really  messing up if you were describing my attempts the way I thought. I also don't want to give you the impression I don't consider your advice valuable, I just figured the worst that could happen was it got rejected. I know it may sound crazy, but I've been trying to do this without making things worse with  Justanother . If I had to find somebody else to sign off besides  Smee  he might think I was creating a cabal against him (I wish I could say I'm joking).  Anynobody  07:59, 8 March 2007 (UTC)     I am fine with whatever  User:Anynobody  and  User:Bishonen  are comfortable with.  Smee  07:03, 7 March 2007 (UTC).     Bishonen  I guess your proposal confused me because  Smee  and myself make two people trying to resolve these issues on  User:Justanother 's talkpage. I found a couple of other editor's who's posts  User:Justanother  archived from his talk page regarding similar concerns. I re-posted it for consideration. If it fails (the RfC), then it fails. I really do appreciate your time on this, thanksÂ :)  Anynobody  04:04, 8 March 2007 (UTC)     [ edit ]   User:Uvak38/Veronica Yurach Aboriginal Artist   User:Uvak38/Veronica Yurach Aboriginal Artist  Thank you Bishonen for moving my article and not just quick deleting it.

I have to agree with Friday and Justanother that there's no external reason for you to be scared, but that doesn't mean it isn't real. That's not what it's supposed to be like to edit here! I hope you'll find it in you to walk away from the most stressful pages for a few days and decompress by editing uncontroversial stuff. When people do that, they're often surpried and relieved to find that other people do pick up the slack. That the page does survive their absence. Or so ALoan tells me. ALoan, back me up here?  Bishonen  |  talk  02:58, 8 March 2007 (UTC).    Thank you for the support.  Smee  03:04, 8 March 2007 (UTC).    And Smee, while I figured the ""Scared"" was all BS for effect, I do realize that I could have been wrong and you might actually be getting that upset and really be feeling fear. Just know, Smee, that I come in peace! Mean you no harm. Would certainly buy you a cuppa coffee if we were to meet. So no worries, man. -- Justanother  03:11, 8 March 2007 (UTC)    That is hard to believe, but I will try. Suffice it to say that that situation would be unlikely to occur.  Smee  03:13, 8 March 2007 (UTC).    Smee, I am a total sweetheart! You would love me. -- Justanother  03:15, 8 March 2007 (UTC)    We're done here.  while I figured the ""Scared"" was all BS for effect  does not go very far towards acknowledging that my feelings are real. It invalidates your following statements. But thanks for the effort. Just try to act like a total sweetheart here on Wikipedia, like you would offline, and we should get along better.  Smee  03:19, 8 March 2007 (UTC).    I said that to explain why I called you a ""drama queen"" instead of making any effort to acknowledge your feelings and try to assuage your fears. Bishonen's reply highlighted my failing so I tried to repair it. Or at least repair the part where you say that you felt fear for your safety in the real world. As far as your ""safety"" here, I offered you an olive branch twice and you spit at me. That said, I have decided to give my sarcasm a rest but you can still expect me to continue to object most strenuously to any abusive editing on your part. -- Justanother  03:25, 8 March 2007 (UTC)    I am glad that you say that you will finally try to give your sarcasm a rest. I am sure that will be appreciated by all.  Smee  03:27, 8 March 2007 (UTC).

The day that originally signified the rebellion of the working women against the kitchen slavery and called for a refusal to accept the oppression and  Babbittry  of the household work!

Is that a  samovar  on top of her?  Bishonen .  ---Yes, it is a samovar all right. And the apron worn by the younger woman is perhaps due to her being a factory worker or something.

That's the connection to Sweden, as Lewis wrote  Babbitt,  and he said, when he accepted, ""Our American professors like their authors like their literature: dead."" Well, Lewis is now liked by professors, and poor, dumb Mr. Babbitt has become an adjective. Why, he's a big man at the local Elk's Club. An Elk is not to be confused with Anne Elk, who was a noted female professor whom the Soviets decided to celebrate on March 8th.

The Response Section is the section after  Statement of the dispute  and before  Outside view . That section is for me and my supporters to make our statements without having to ""defend"" them in threaded discussions.

In your edit summary, you have stated that you see the parties' attempts to resolve the dispute were inadequate. However, the subject of this RfC has engaged in repeated egregiously uncivil and disruptive behavior, not only against  Anynobody , but against any editor who does not share his beliefs or takes issue with his behavior. In fact, I had comments to add to the RfC, and to my surprise, the RfC was deleted. Please note I have seen efforts by  Anynobody  to resolve their dispute, and to avoid a dispute in the first instance. But as your edit cites that you view previous efforts of the dispute resolution as being inadequate, can you (as an experienced editor, especially in these types of matters) please suggest ways in which this type of dispute can be better handled and resolved, or what other steps should have been taken prior to creating the now deleted RfC? I seek the benefit of your experience and hope you can show the way here. Kind regards,  Orsini  03:52, 10 March 2007 (UTC)     02:36, 10 March 2007 Bishonen (Talk | contribs) deleted ""Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Justanother"" (This is much older than 48 hours with the certification still woefully inadequate, as I warned the participants several days ago, and Justanother has requested deletion.)  Bishonen  I understand you felt that it didn't meet the RfC requirements, however somebody else did and added it to the approved section. Moreover you didn't respond to my last post under the RfC discussion explaining that I was not the only signer, which is why it got approved I thought. You could have at least explained your view more clearly before deleting the RfC, either in the request itself or the RfC talk page.. I can see by your talk page history that you and  Justanother  are friends, and I suspect you may have let your feelings get in the way on this issue. I'm asking you to undelete the RfC, as there were other editors who have yet to comment. There certainly must be some way to escalate this matter above you, and must point out that if you take no further action I will research and pursue them.  Anynobody  04:20, 10 March 2007 (UTC)        I could have explained my view more clearly? Gosh. Well, if you say so. I did my best. [50]  Certainly there are ways of seeking review of administrative actions, and I encourage you to pursue them. The formal way is to open an RFC on me. A simpler, more informal way is to post on  WP:ANI . See the page instructions: ""If you want to make an open informal complaint over the behaviour of an admin, you can do so here.""  Bishonen  |  talk  12:40, 10 March 2007 (UTC).       Hello Anynobody, I can appreciate why you may be understandably annoyed at the RfC being deleted. However, I cannot agree with your assessment that Bishonen and Justanother are operating in a conflict of interest; in fact, please note  this exchange  with regards to the BabyDweezil case. It would appear the RfC User Comment process is very time-consuming, which is one reason why editors and admins are reluctant to pursue them, except in clear cases of disputes which cannot be resolved any other way. My personal opinion of Justanother's editing behavior is that it is inappropriate, however in order to back a new RfC, I would also need to demonstrate that I had made adequate attempts to resolve my dispute with Justanother, which I cannot do, as Justanother appears to me to become overtly hostile as soon as the premises he cites as facts are called into question. I find it difficult to reach consensus when such behavior is exhibited. However, I do believe and have observed that, to your credit, you have not only attempted to avoid disputes in the first place, you have also made considerable efforts to resolve them, despite Justanother's clearly uncivil and disruptive behavior, and the tag team games being played with an editor who has now been banned. It also appears to me that Justanother has a pattern of making comments to incite and provoke people, and initiate discussions in which his stated premises are inherently flawed; to cite one example of many: in the Barbara Schwarz article, he falsely claimed it was sourced mainly from postings to the Usenet and thus is not reliably sourced. I have read Bishonen's comments  here  and other comments about the process  here  and I hope Bishonen can suggest some ways to resolve the dispute. I do not personally believe Bishonen let feelings interfere with the RfC issue, and I believe you may agree that Bishonen may have had feelings to the contrary of those suggested after reading the exchange above with regards to the ""section break and noticeboard disruption"". Please review it, as it may change some of your opinions stated above. Kind regards,  Orsini  09:58, 10 March 2007 (UTC)               How about instead of deleting, you could move it back to  User:Anynobody/Requests for comment/Justanother ?  Smee  04:22, 10 March 2007 (UTC).        What, again? Sorry, no, that's not the way it's done. See the RFC instructions: ""If this does not happen within 48 hours of the creation of this dispute page (which was: 00:29, 6 March 2007 (UTC)), the page will be deleted."" Not ""will be moved to the userspace"". Also, not ""may"" be deleted:  will  be deleted.  Bishonen  |  talk  12:40, 10 March 2007 (UTC).       I think it's been totally deleted, so it needs to be started from scratch - if it's appropriate to deal with the issue in this way.  Orsini  09:58, 10 March 2007 (UTC)    Can I suggest, Orsini? I'm afraid you've caught me at a bad time for it. I did suggest, as you saw at the top of this page, under the heading ""Minor formatting"", where I did my very best to babysit this RFC to one that would  not  have to be deleted. Anynobody had pursued reasonable dispute resolution, Smee had not. Note that according to the rules, dispute resolution must be done by two editors, and must be  seen to have been done , in the RFC itself, in the form of diffs, under the heading ""Evidence of trying and failing to resolve the dispute"". I tried to explain how vital this was, and repeatedly warned Smee and Anynobody about the 48-hour rule. First I tried to get Anynobody to keep it in his userspace, to give time for the matter to be taken care of; indeed at one point I boldly moved it there myself; he would have none of it. I explained to Smee what was wrong with the diffs he presented as dispute resolution  I quote myself:                                   The links at ""Evidence of trying and failing to resolve the dispute"" are no good, to put it brutally. Posting warning templates on JA's page certainly doesn't qualify as attempted dispute resolution. (Didn't I tell you once that it was frowned on?) Dispute resolution means a bona fide attempt at reaching out, and I think you may be too upset with JA to be the best person for it. Suggestion: try asking Jossi, who knows the ropes, to contact JA and try to talk with him about Anynobody's concerns. (Yes, I know there's little time for that... people do tend to run short of time at this point. The way it's looking now, practically any admin will delete the page after 48 hours, if JA requests it.)                                   The links that were there when I deleted the RFC were no better. So, you ask, can I suggest alternative ways of resolving the dispute? Yes: try  mediation . If anybody involved in this dispute wants further admin advice, I have to recommend you to ask someone else. I'm all talked out.  Bishonen  |  talk  12:40, 10 March 2007 (UTC).                                   Talked out as you may now be, your efforts in spelling out things so concisely above are appreciated, and have not been wasted. Thank you for your reply.

I don't know  why  I didn't delete it and create a new article so as to obliterate the history, but I suppose it was so that I could make a point about how more junk needs deleting and starting over. A valid  subject  does not warrant leaving garbage in place.  Geogre  13:33, 10 March 2007 (UTC) (Addendum: it's also at a position against Wikipedia naming conventions. It  soooo  should have been deleted when it was a dirty joke. Not now, of course.)     Wikify! Cleanup! Replace deprecated template! Fix some spelling errors! Where would we be without the  wikignomes ! By the time I got to the people who changed the whole example sketch to ""I like pussy"" or ""I like cheeseburger"", I had every sympathy. They sure didn't make it any worse.  Bishonen  |  talk  21:50, 10 March 2007 (UTC).     Yeah. It started as original essay with incorrect information, then got labelled a bunch, then got turned into ""I like pussy,"" and that was ""cleaned up"" to ""cheeseburgers."" An analytical essay? Huh? Mine's not good, mind you, but I also don't think we especially  need  an article on what a character sketch is. A character sketch is a ... sketch ... of ... a character.  Geogre  03:16, 11 March 2007 (UTC)     Have you thought of plumping it up with a bit of Pope? Remember the characters of women? I often quote ""Some women have no character at all"" to myself, in my head, when I catch myself with my hand in the  salmiak  jar.Â :-)  Bishonen  |  talk  04:07, 11 March 2007 (UTC).    That's true, although, I suppose, to be nice about it, the ""character sketch"" is probably more common and better known as the ""memories of Local Person"" in the newspaper and the ""portrait of Grotesque"" that creative writing classes assign, so it would be a little mean to put in Atticus or Sporus or any of the women who have no characters in the Epistle to a Lady. Now, for an article on character, it would be  so  in.  Geogre  12:59, 11 March 2007 (UTC)    Oh, and  ewwwww!  for any candy that is only candy with the proper chemical added.

Thanks for your input on the deletion vote on my user page. I appreciate the support for our little creative effort, even though it went nowhere. Even though my time is limited, I did manage to do some archiving and ran my watchlist during the last week. Some important material was lost to vandalism, so I see that things have not really changed much.

WBardwin  16:40, 10 March 2007 (UTC)     My thanks to you, and your friends, for a reply. In looking things over (I really was out of the wiki-loop), the revelations about  User:Essjay  has shaken things up here. I had a good opinion of him/her in our limited contact, and appreciated his/her contributions. I see that  User:Dmcdevit , who I ""talk"" with regularly, seems to have taken some personal responsibility for the situation, as he had recommended Essjay for additional responsibilities. This is so very unfortunate for all sincere editors here -- and for the encyclopedia. How are the administrators dealing with the issue? Is there anyway we peons could help? Best........  WBardwin  01:26, 18 March 2007 (UTC)    We're all peons here, W. I have little idea what goes on in the higher echelons. As many people are fond of pointing out, with a triumph I never quite understood,  WP:NOT  a democracy. Bishzilla has the little arbcom in her pocket, but, heck, that's her, not me. As usual with the latest scandal, there was a furore ( here  and  here ), and then it died down. The big difference is that the outside world is a lot more interested (not in a good way) this time.Â :-( Let's see, what else. Oh, yes, Jimbo Wales has proposed a ""verified credentials"" scheme. [51]  If that means an enforced release of our real identities on the internets, I'm out of here, personallyI'm funny that way. But, perhaps strangely, I haven't followed the case closely.

[ edit ]   Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/InShaneee/Evidence   I know you didn't mean to, but I think mistakently labeled InShaneee as blocking Worldtraveller's account in your evidence page. As you can see by the block log,  [52]  InShaneee never blocked Worldtraveller directly, only indirectly when he was a IP on January 2  i think this is the log . I came to request you actually change the title of the section of your evidence page to ""InShaneee's block of  Worldtraveller' ,  3  January 2007"" to ""InShaneee's block of  81.178.208.69 ,  2  January 2007"", because while the fact that it was Worldtraveller behind the IP, InShaneee never blocked Worldtraveller directly. Thanks!   Moe  03:13, 11 March 2007 (UTC)     Oh, hi, Moe. Did I refer to the wrong block log? That wouldn't surprise me, but I can't find where I refer to a log for the 24-hour January block at all. If I did, can you tell me where, please? As for changing the heading, or referring to WT by his (varying) IP, no, I'd rather not. I call the user--the person--Worldtraveller throughout--it's not a mistake, but rather a mark of respect. I don't think it has any potential for misunderstanding, either, since I don't discuss the circumstances of InShaneee's block of the anonymous editor at all (if I had, I would have gone into the IP thing.) I have assumed WT himself and others will do that sufficiently, and also canvass the IP thing to the point of boredom and beyond--the arbcom doesn't have any realistic chance to miss it. I discuss the aftermath. (Same reasoning with A Link to the Past, btw--I don't address the reasons for the block, I assume others will). I don't want that heading changed. But thanks for bringing it up for consideration! I appreciate your scrupulousness in taking it to me, rather than changing it yourself. (P. S. Wrong date? Weird. Thanks.)  Bishonen  |  talk  03:42, 11 March 2007 (UTC).    Well, since it technically WT's IP and the section is accuratly describing everything else for the most part, I guess it doesn't hurt anything to say that it was in fact WT blocked instead of the IP. I just thought for the sake of accuracy it should be changed *shrug* no matter. Yeh, my scrupulousness is shocking too considering how many  bold  things I do without discussing it firstÂ :) Cheers!   Moe  04:55, 11 March 2007 (UTC)           [ edit ]   Link to response from CBDunkerson  (eom)     Eom? Is that like ""burp"" or ""yum"" or ""excuse me?"" It really should be.  Geogre  02:24, 12 March 2007 (UTC)       I hope you don't mind me butting in here, but I think you may have misread CBD's original comment. He was indeed defending you against Tony's ridiculous attack. (and, Geogre, if you really don't know, eom means ""end of message""). --  Rick Block   ( talk )  18:45, 12 March 2007 (UTC)        And I always tell my students never to write ""In conclusion"" in their conclusions: the words stop, so I figure that's the conclusion. Putting in a TLA to announce that there will be no more words is a bit weird, and saying, ""This is all I have to say to  you  (link) and that's  all  I intend to say (eom)"" is a bit...oh, let's call it brusque.  Geogre  20:39, 12 March 2007 (UTC)       And I think you may have read it too superficially, so we're even.  Bishonen  |  talk  18:56, 12 March 2007 (UTC).    My paraphrase of CBD's coment: ""Boy Howdy it sure does look like them fellas are conspiring together in a nasty convoluted plot with the sole goal of getting Inshaneee in trouble for some reason, but the AGF policy says we have to pretend it's just a crazy coink-i-dink, yup."" Very inspiring stuff.  Bunchofgrapes  ( talk ) 19:04, 12 March 2007 (UTC)    You go from strength to strength, dear boy.  Bishonen  |  talk  19:30, 12 March 2007 (UTC).                   Now wait a minute. First, about ""eom"". It's an ""email""-ism, sort of like the old radio-speak where when one person is done talking they say ""over"" and people take turns talking. When one is done, they say ""over and out"". In the radio world this was because the communication channel was half duplex and both folks couldn't talk at once. In email, it's been adopted as a courtesy to indicate a subject only message is not a mistake. This was only a poke to turn Bishonen's ""you have new messages"" indicator on. ""Brusque"" only if you don't understand the context. In context, it's meant to be courteous. I'm not CBD, and haven't interacted with him a lot, but my assumption is he meant this as a courtesy, not to be brusque.       Second, about CBD's original comment. I think Bunchofgrapes's paraphrase is nowhere near accurate. I'm not sure you've noticed, but I am one of the folks who objected to his block of WT. I'm on your side in this. But this doesn't mean everything CBD says is evil. My paraphrase would be ""Hey, Tony, your interpretation of this requires a bizarre convoluted nasty plot that no reasonable person would imagine could possibly be the case."" His phrasing was a little oblique (and he's later apologized about this as well), but IMO the basic message was supportive. There may indeed be more history here than I'm seeing, but this is how I'm interpreting this exchange. --  Rick Block   ( talk )  02:05, 13 March 2007 (UTC)        I hope it didn't look like anybody here was being brusque to you, in any case. I appreciate your taking the trouble to post.  Bishonen  |  talk  02:24, 13 March 2007 (UTC).       I think it's sort of cool that we have someone who, when presented with a clear choice, will reliably choose to defend the  greater  of two evils. If nothing else, he's a handy moral barometer to have around, in the sense of a compass that always points South.

(  Netscott )  04:00, 13 March 2007 (UTC)       I followed a link from the Arbcom case here and noticed this discussion. The link and 'eom' thing is my standard way of handling comments on my talk page... I respond there and post a link so that the person is notified of the response, but the discussion is not split between two pages. The 'eom' is to clarify that it is not an error that no further message is included below the title... which used to be an extremely common usage, but is apparently a bit dated. Sorry if it was unclear, perhaps I should link the 'eom' to  End of Message .   On the other bit, I had already explained a few times that I was trying to underline how outlandish Tony's accusation was. If you choose not to accept that then there seems little I can do about it.   Finally, thank you Rick - for demonstrating the sort of character and true meaning of AGF, even towards those you disagree with, which all users should aspire to. -- CBD  22:29, 18 March 2007 (UTC)       [ edit ]   Courtesy link   Bishonen, you might want to look at this, since it appears that once of your posts to AN/I was wiped.

So anyway long story short, going back to several other similar cases of block-evasion/ban-evasion such as  User:Nationalist ,  User:PoolGuy , etc, it is pretty apparent that there isn't a great distinction between an indef. block and community ban. Obviously, circumventing a ban and then getting rewarded for it just seems illogical. Seriously, this is a joke. But anyway, worst case scentario I guess is to go straight to arbCom and get them to define an actual distinction between block and ban. Oh and btw did Crum e-mail youb back? Your thoughts on this?-- Certified.Gangsta  10:33, 13 March 2007 (UTC)     I know. Yes, he replied, it's me that's been real busy, sorry. But I saw the lates post on your page... it's a relief.  Bishonen  |  talk  14:29, 13 March 2007 (UTC).    Thanks Bishy. On a related note, do you think it's necessary to protect his talkpage too? Given that there are some crazy wikilawyering and that unblock requests have been turned down more than 4 times in his previous accounts combined.-- Certified.Gangsta  23:30, 13 March 2007 (UTC)    No, I don't. Protecting the talkpage of a blocked user is a very extreme action, it should only be done in cases of extreme and ongoing disruption. On a semi-related note, I  commented  in that weird half-archived thread on ANI, don't know if you saw it?  Bishonen  |  talk  23:36, 13 March 2007 (UTC).    Yup I just did.

These repeated cases of vitriolic harassment are intolerable. A clear consensus has also emerged at the CN discussion.  Rama's arrow  22:17, 14 March 2007 (UTC)       [ edit ]   A favor   Hi. I know that  User:Smee  respects your opinion so I am asking if you would be interested in helping out with my dispute with Smee over what I consider his  WP:DE . I have sincerely tried to get him to stop but this is ongoing and just cropped up again. I would like to get a 3rd party involved, not as a precursor to some time-wasting User RfC, but to genuinely handle this dispute. Here is the latest:     Once upon a time there was a small article about a small anti-Scientology propaganda piece called  The Bridge (film) . It looked like  this  not too long ago. I had been editing in the article almost since its creation. Smee has been there a while too, we met there in fact and Smee gave me a Barnstar for being nice to him (that is because I am nice, at least until it is proven that the intention to be nice is most definitely not shared).   Smee made a series of edits to give what I consider undue prominence to the dedication in what I consider an effort to make the article itself into an anti-Scientology propaganda piece.  Here  and then with a screenshot  here . There are other similar efforts by Smee at what I consider propagandizing both in that article and in others but I am not addressing Smee's POV-pushing here, I am addressing his  WP:DE  in pursuit of it.   Ten minutes  after   opening  a topic in talk, I  removed  the undue prominence and replaced it with a mention of the dedication in the lead; a very fair compromise, I thought.   One hour later, Smee  reverted  me without discussion even though I had specifically invited discussion in talk. He claimed in that edit summary I lacked consensus when, in actual fact, his ""dedicating the article"" is what really lacked consensus. He claimed I failed to discuss when it was him that had failed to discuss. Smee continued his improper edit-warring ( history ) and only stopped because I  asked  a neutral 3rd party to weigh in. When the neutral party also objected (more as a ""film person"" I think than as someone sensitive to the use of this project as a propaganda medium but that speaks to the fact that propagandists violate simple standards of article creation that are evident even without considering POV issues), Smee self-reverted with a deprecating remark. Another editor with media experience came in and agreed on non-POV issues that Smee's edit is inappropriate for the article.     In my opinion, Smee's behavior in this incident is disrespectful and disruptive. Bishonen, I could show you a number of similar incidents but this one shows my problem just fine, I think. It really is a problem; not my POV, not me whining, etc. Smee makes inappropriate edits then edit wars over them rather then discuss and continues to edit war until a 3rd party or parties come in and back me up (and they always seem to back me up). I do not mind that Smee does not want to take my word when I say that one of his edits will not stand. That is his right. I do want him to stop edit-warring to reinsert the inappropriate POV edit until the issue is resolved. The disputed material should be removed to talk and discussed and remain removed until the issue is resolved, not reinserted repeatedly in some phony ""compromise"" (a term he likes to use as he reinserts). That is my  desired outcome . His agreement to to so. Would you please help us? Thanks. -- Justanother  14:00, 15 March 2007 (UTC)     Sorry, Justanother.

El_C  04:39, 16 March 2007 (UTC)     Bishonen is just about Gangsta's only friend at Wikipedia. If you look at the thread on AN/I, you will see that she angrily defended him when I mentioned the fake banner incident. Gangsta interpreted this to mean ""you're the one who is stalking, disrupting, bullying, and POV pushing all over the place. Bishonen made that quite clear."" I asked Bishonen to confirm or deny that this is really what she meant to say; she has not replied yet. I am surprised you are not aware of this. Have you read the entire thread? -- Ideogram  04:44, 16 March 2007 (UTC)     What is: ""Given the concerns expressed at  Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/InShaneee/Workshop "" supposed to mean, specifically?  El_C  04:57, 16 March 2007 (UTC)     Thanks for your interest, El C. In the workshop for the RFAr on InShaneee, Tony Sidaway offered the ""Proposed finding of fact"" that Worldtraveller had stalked and personally attacked InShaneee, and that ""statements by some experienced Wikipedians"" had encouraged him to do so. [55]  The only link given by Tony for that encouragement was to a statement by me. Tony and Ideogram went on to discuss how my ""bad advice"" was something of an excuse for Worldtraveller (who protested indignantly at what he called ""condescending nonsense""). I'm assuming that workshop thread was the concern Ideogram had in mind. I didn't reply to the Proposed finding. Tony had linked to  some of my best work , so there didn't seem much to add. Perhaps Ideogram was worried I might not have seen it, and prodded me on ANI and here on my page to get a dialogue going? I don't think that would be fruitful or constructive though. (I have some prior experience of attempting to dialogue with him.) El C, please don't encourage him to post here. Ideogram, please don't post here.  Bishonen  |  talk  11:12, 16 March 2007 (UTC).

Bunchofgrapes  ( talk ) 18:45, 16 March 2007 (UTC)    One  RV  should be enough, I would think.

There's no context to what he says. Or is there a war at  donut , which is often misspelled as ""donot."" Donuts are for eating, and they make very poor implements of war.

(btw, you may want to tell bishzilla to be more carefully when handling editors. It took me a LONG time to de-flattenify myself after I got squashed!)  Anyways, I noticed that the  sata logo  was a jpg, and there's a notice requesting that someone replace it with a svg or png image. I'm veeery new to svg, and have zero knowledge of how to upload images, do copyright stuff, yadda yadda yadda.  So, anyways, I just used inkscape to essentially trace the original logo, also exported as a png, and uploaded both to my school account. Any chance you upload  this  and/or  this , if they are suitable replacements? (And  [56]  is just a link to a blown-up svg version, if that's necessary for anything)  This request also goes out to any of the many editors who tend to read this talk page. (except bishzilla.

Most article talk pages have been GimmeBotified, but not all; the (temporary) instructions are hard to nail down during the transition because there are several different scenarios. The bot moves the facfailed nomination to an archive, closes and tags it, clears the redirect, leaving a link to the old nom on the cleared fac page, so that a subsequent nominator will find the old failedfac already linked on the new fac page (hence, ""retain""). ""Add"" will go away once botification is finished, and retain will be accurate. While the bot work is underway, I've been watching each fac nom to make sure all the pieces are in the right place. I'm going to be traveling; if you want to tweak further to cover all the bases until the bot work is done, Gimmetrow can help. Eventually, the instructions will have to be rewritten, eliminating any mention of add, move or archive, as the bot will have done all of that in advance.

Matthew Brown (Morven)  ( T : C ) 12:04, 18 March 2007 (UTC)    A random thought from the gallery: should  the  edits be deleted, as in essence they are a copyright violation as the edit by the IP doesn't attribute Giano as the author, as required by the  GFDL ? With Bramham Park, the only edits between the IP adding the info and Bish reverting it are minor fixes, and in essence they are all copyvios. Thoughts? Cheers,  DanielÂ Bryant  07:36, 20 March 2007 (UTC)  retreats back into the shadows and rejoins other people who watch  Giano's contribs to his userspace  to see what article will be the next FAÂ :)     You mean I should delete all revisions after MortimerCat? That's a thought. I didn't think of the credit thing and the GFDLI assumed Giano's work was in fact free to steal once he'd saved it anywhere at all on WikipediaI removed it only on the principle that it was unsourced and unreliable and the author had even  said  so. (I won't deny that I  wanted  to remove it, but the attribution angle didn't occur to me.) OK, I'll remove those suckers. I was lucky the case was so simpleI don't know what I would have done if somebody else had made substantial additions after the IP edit. Been petrified with indecision, probably. As for the next FA, I believe Giano has foresworn producing any more of those, after recent scarring experiences of  WP:FAR . [63]   Bishonen  |  talk  08:56, 20 March 2007 (UTC).                                   Thanks for all the support here! I didn't realise people watched my uses space so much - I shall have to watch some of the less than flattering things I write about some buildings there. I'm not bothered too much about credit - but I do like a little acknowledgement sometimes. Also I do like to check my spelling and dates etc before going into mainspace. I'm afraid, you will all have a very long wait though for the next FA - you have seen the last of those. I write only in my style, in the way I think is correct for an encyclopedia. It would be a waste of time FACing my pages as I am reliably informed via the FARC page that they would not pass today. I refuse to ref such well known facts as "" During the 17th century, many architects studying in Italy learned of Palladio's work "" - as I have been asked to do on FARC. Finally, this classic comment here referring to my writing - """" In 1570 Palladio published his book I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura, inspiring architects across Europe."" Inspired who? According to what researcher? Needs citation, otherwise is original research.""  made me realise that if I have to look up every obvious and accepted fact, then I would be unable to write an FA again anyway, as any spontaneity and freedom of expression in a page would be gone. They would become so dull no-one would ever bother to read to the end. While I am happy to ref a Prince of Monaco sleeping with his mother-in-law (because not a lot of people know that!) - and it makes a dull section on history page more interesting and fun - I am not about to become a ""Master of the Obvious"" referencing every well known fact just to please a few style and rule obsessive zealots . I feel wikipedia is so full of little stubs begging to be improved, and subjects on which nothing is written - we could all more profitably spend our time attending to these things, rather than attacking the better pages.                               I know some other former FA writes such as Geogre and Bishonen share some of my views - which is a pity as they have produced some of the better and more intellectual FAs essential for a encyclopedia of any worth and value. I 100% believe references should be listed and I'm glad to see their are still some very good editors turning out first rate FAs but there is also a worrying amount of FAs on pop music and computer type things sourced entirely from the internet - not in my view a static medium. I would like to see more FAs sharing sources with not only the internet but also books with few pictures and 973 pages. Giano  09:59, 20 March 2007 (UTC)                                   (""V=IR? Do you have a citation to this so-called Ohm's Law? I see that you have a link, but you need to have a citation, and then this 'R=V/I' needs another citation.

Geogre  10:27, 20 March 2007 (UTC)           Sadly  User: Ohm  would probably have been banned from editing such pages, because of his insistance on own research and citing himself!  Giano  10:34, 20 March 2007 (UTC)             I am interested in this. I think it's a really dirty thing to do. I ran checkuser on the IP at Bish's request, but it's too old.  Raul654  14:30, 20 March 2007 (UTC)         We are not talking about that anymore, as you very well know Raul!  Giano  16:16, 20 March 2007 (UTC)         I have been considering pushing an article of my own to FA level sometime in the next couple of months, and I have to say that what I have been reading about the FA reviewers demanding a footnote reference after every sentence is a serious deterrent to my wanting to do that. This page is probably not where I should be saying it, because I'm preaching to the choir here, but if our most motivated authors are choosing not to create featured content because of idiosyncrasies of the selection process, that is a serious problem.  Newyorkbrad  14:36, 20 March 2007 (UTC)             Well there is nowher else to say it, unless you want to be shouted down, we are clearly in a minority - so we teo choices write FAs to the standards of others, write mere ordinary pages to out own standards. I am choosing the latter.  Giano  16:16, 20 March 2007 (UTC)               What they are doing, so far as I can see, is to produce their usual excellent articles, but they are just not bothering to ask for the shiny star to be affixed to them. But  Medieval cuisine  shows how it should be. --  ALoan   (Talk)  16:27, 20 March 2007 (UTC)     And what are you going to expect other people (who aren't experts in  Medieval cuisine ) to do when someone else edits your article, and follows your style of not citing enough? You don't  own  them, you know. Say you get three edits adding or changing information that seem reasonably likely; two are good, one is bad. How do you expect someone not yourself to know which of the three to revert and which to keep, if you don't give them sources to compare to? This is not just a hypothetical case, I just blocked an editor who had fun doing exactly that, inserting minor inaccuracies in uncited articles. See  Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/Incidents#Sneaky_vandalism  - he was doing this since June 2006. If he had done this to something like  Jenna Jameson , which is cited up the wazoo, his edits would be easily checked against reliable sources. As is, he got away with it for months. Do you really want him to be able to do that to your featured articles? -- AnonEMouse   (squeak)  16:49, 20 March 2007 (UTC)     Attribution really helps an article, it is not just policy but a good idea. It allows editors who do not know the subject to competently judge the merits of the contributions of others.  High InBC (Need help?  Ask me )  16:53, 20 March 2007 (UTC)    (ed conf) For an example, a sentence in  Medieval cuisine  implies strongly that  olive oil  was a recommended drink! Is that vandalism? Don't know - maybe it is vandalism, maybe it is a poor turn of phrase, maybe it is even accurate. How is a humble mouse like myself supposed to know where to go to check the veracity of such a statement? Am I just supposed to take the article's word for it? Or am I supposed to read all 6 books mentioned in the references, with no indication of where to look, just in case one of them actually says that? -- AnonEMouse   (squeak)  16:58, 20 March 2007 (UTC)    Well, you could have tried to simply let your gaze descend to the closest footnote following that statement and checked those pages out. The footnote refers to 4 pages from Scully. Is it really that baffling that two paragraphs and a quote can be covered by such a modest reading assignment?   Peter   Isotalo  00:04, 21 March 2007 (UTC)    And since Bish's talkpage seems to be a more relevant place than the  article talkpage  to voice concerns about an article issue, here's the passage causing such consternation: ""For most medieval Europeans, it [beer] was a humble brew compared with common southern drinks and cooking ingredients, such as wine or olive oil.""   Peter   Isotalo  00:09, 21 March 2007 (UTC)       Of course obscure facts like that should be referenced, no one (certainly not me) is arguing otherwise - It is well known facts that can easily be confirmed if not already known and taken for granted that do not need to be cited. Anyway you can have FAs anyway you like them, because the rules no longer apply to me, I am free of FAs and over zealous rules invented often by people who have no need to apply them to their own work - I am talking about proper FAs not articles on ""here today gone tomorrow"" movie stars and pop songs written using 101 ""here today gone tomorrow"" internet sites each themselves of dubious quality,  Giano  17:25, 20 March 2007 (UTC)                   Oh my, what if someone who's not an expert edits the article? Then it won't be reliable? What if they edit and don't give footnotes? Those arguments are,  at their best,  an argument against Wikipedia. After all, what do we do when someone edits the article on Bob Roberts? What do we do when someone edits the article on George W. Bush? Do we have to have footnotes to know the difference? Hey, what if someone  edits the footnotes!  What if ""someone""  inserts a bogus reference?  Do you think it's even remotely possible to turn out a heavily footnoted article where the footnotes refer to fictitious books? This argument is against an encyclopedia anyone can edit. I also love the implication that someone is advocating not footnoting enough. In fact, I advocate  appropriate  references. My version of appropriate means some education in the reader. My version means no footnotes, all parentheticals. Your arguments are really, really off the mark and weak.  Geogre  18:46, 20 March 2007 (UTC)    I would say anon's argument is very much in line with the spirit of Wikipedia, and are rather compelling. Attribution is important.  High InBC (Need help?  Ask me )  18:50, 20 March 2007 (UTC)            We are going arownd in ever increasing circles, so I am going away, this is becoming boring, I'll come back when it gets interesting again.  Giano  18:53, 20 March 2007 (UTC)           Apologies for not keeping Giano properly amused.  I can tell you what to do when someone adds a dubious claim to a well cited article. Check their edits against the citation. If they don't agree, the claim is wrong. That works equally well if the claim is bogus or if the source is. That way we don't have to worry whether the editor has a doctorate in theology or is merely diligent at using Google; we don't care if they're an expert, merely if their sources are. If they don't give a citation, that stands out as something that should be cited, tagged, or removed. Wikipedia is not reliable in and of itself, specifically because anonymous mice  can  edit - and don't think I'm saying that's a bad thing, that's the reason I am allowed to be here, after all. However, it does mean that proper attribution is the only thing we have that can give articles that reliability. That doesn't mean citing every sentence, but it does mean that when someone doubts a fact, it is only assuming good faith to believe that doubt, and be able to reference that fact. Frankly, assuming that every educated reader already knows that a 1570 book inspired architects across Europe is common knowledge is attributing quite a lot to common knowledge. -- AnonEMouse   (squeak)  19:54, 20 March 2007 (UTC)    That is not the meaning of ""common knowledge"" on Wikipedia. Please see  this userpage .  Bishonen  |  talk  21:47, 20 March 2007 (UTC).           I suppose I have more faith in the power of a college degree, but knowing that Palladianism came from Palladio only required a single Art History class for me. I would have known Palladianism anyway, a bit after my sophomore year, when I hit it in a History of England class. I would have learned it as a senior, if I hadn't learned it as a sophomore or a junion, when I took a class in Europe Between the Wars. I have ""learned"" that fact a dozen times in college. We do  not  cite everything. We  do  rely on good faith. Remember that  WP:AGF  refers to  articles,  not taggers or blocks or other things. In fact, Wikipedia was the gamble built on the assumption that more people wanted correct information than wanted to vandalize, and we are extremely susceptible to dishonest editors. We always will be. That's the nature of the game. If people want to read undergraduate research papers, they can, but that's not the standard of any encyclopedia. I find them unspeakably insulting. ""The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is named after Heizenberg (note)"" makes me want to slap someone. How stupid do they think I am? How stupid do they think readers are in general? How stupid are they that they had to go dig up a reference to assure themselves of that? Most articles have no citations. This is a good thing, generally. Those with unusual knowledge need  references,  but not stickypad citations.  Geogre  20:40, 20 March 2007 (UTC)    Everything must citable. That doesn't mean it needs to be cited. Some people have problem with this concept. As for what people think of our readers, my guess is that deep down, we all want the encyclopedia to be written for people like ourselves. Regards,  Ben Aveling  21:06, 20 March 2007 (UTC)               Just looked in to see if the conversation had taken a perk, or anyone eloquent had looked in - No. So Bishonendearhart, do terminate this because it is going nowhere - we are all agreed we are done with FAs - can't be bothered with all the new malarky and claptrap far too stressful, and insulting to the intelligence. This moment in time heralds the beginning of a brave new era for Wikipedia the FAs of  AnonEMouse  ( Jenna Jameson );  LuciferMorgan 's  Christ Illusion  and those of a similar mind-frame are obviously the way to go. Sadly my blood pressure these days does not allow for porn queens, and my interest in Christ is confined to mass and praying for eternal redemption - not that I'm admitting to a link between the two. I wish all the new FA writers well - but I can't agree with them, I shall not be joining them on the main page - I will be continuing in my own odd referencing ways - so I think all that needs to be said has been said.  Giano  21:58, 20 March 2007 (UTC)    With respect, lowbrow or popular culture articles at FAs is not new. The very first archive of FA,  Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Featured log/October 2003 and before , includes  Leet ,  Have I Got News for You ,  Madonna (entertainer) , and  Sex Pistols . I have nothing but respect for the many FAs of Giano on European architecture, and Geogre on lesser known English wliterature, at a quick glance. I can only hope to eventually be as skilled and prolific. However, we need more good writing on any subject in the encyclopedia, including the ones that I or LuciferMorgan chose. If we have these subjects at all, they may as well be covered as well as possible, which, in the current way of doing things, means bringing them up to the standard of FA, which does seem to include citations. That is the current standard of the Wikipedia community, and it does have reasons behind it.  (rephrased, with apologies) -- AnonEMouse   (squeak)  06:28, 22 March 2007 (UTC)         Here I am, up late to update DYK for the second time today (late both times because no-one else seems to want to do it, even though the next update page was ready to go ages ago) and what do I find?  [64]  This is not a featured article by any stretch, but it is a nice, concise article, culled from 4 (FOUR) consistent obituaries in broadsheet newspapers, and someone adds tags saying it does not have enough citations and needs cleanup.   Citations? CLEANUP?? Honestly. --  ALoan   (Talk)  01:07, 21 March 2007 (UTC)         I have moderated my comment above, now the balance of my equanimity has been restored. Obviously it is possible to add refs after every sentence (see  John Inman ) but I really don't see the point in this case. The only mildly difficult fact in  Peter Prendergast (artist)  is that he was ""recognised as the leading landscape painter in Wales"" (by whom? when?) but that is cited (and, on reflection, I suppose I ought to cite ""the biggest man-made hole in Europe, like Breughel's Tower of Babel, but in reverse""). But ""cleanup""? How, for goodness sake? --  ALoan   (Talk)  17:13, 21 March 2007 (UTC)               PS - please don't stomp on  me , Bishzilla!           Bishzilla stomp on tag spam.

DanielÂ Bryant  10:22, 21 March 2007 (UTC)    I wanted to settle an argument with a friend about ""dyke,"" so I looked at  dyke . Citations all over the place and tags for ""has no sources"" to go with every one of them. On the other hand, there are articles like  1992 World Rally Championship season  where there is  only  a box. What the hell is that? Is this a graphic novel or an encyclopedia? Why can't the ""we need facts"" jerks go beat up on the ""here is a box and I cannot finish a sentence"" yaboes?  Utgard Loki  14:33, 21 March 2007 (UTC}    Oh Utgard, I do so agree with you.  Giano  17:57, 21 March 2007 (UTC)       I just go around all day, hitting the ""Random"" button. I recommend it to anyone. See what's really in Wikipedia. The #1 hit type is probably ""footballer"" -- usually either 2 lines or 2,000 -- and then ""X is a place in Nation the end,"" and I'm not talking about those Census department things you see for US cities and towns, either. Then we get to the really stomach churning ""This is a single by MinorBand released in RecentMonth and here is a picture of it."" I released singles, an e.p., and an l.p. in a former band, and hell if I'd expect anyone to look them up here. What the heck could I say about them? ""We released this, and it got played on about 110 radio stations, according to tracking reports. We sold all the copies we made of the first pressing, and that netted us a grand total of $280?"" Bleck. Then again, I'm not a ""footballer.""  Utgard Loki  12:37, 22 March 2007 (UTC)        Looks like we have another truly delicious (fire-breathing, even) citation conflict brewing.  Behold ! That's what you get for mentioning an FA that doesn't have a citation per sentence...       Peter   Isotalo  19:24, 21 March 2007 (UTC)        Aloan should have known better than to mention it in the first place - it is like putting up an advert for a candy factory next to a wasp's nest. It only encourages them. I just wish they would write something interesting and show us all how it should be done - lead by example - Yes i know some of them do write and No, I don't want to be pointed to a page on porn stars, pop stars and fruits of said stars' labours - referenced entirely by equally dodgy internet sites  Giano  19:53, 21 March 2007 (UTC)                         Oh dear - I didn't mean to poke the hornets nest.Â :( The people on the talk page need to read about the apocryphal  Marie Therese / Marie Antoinette  ""cake"" incident, [66] [67]  ( brie ?!) and watch the ""I Know My Place"" sketch.

Thank you, AnonEMouse.  Bishonen  |  talk  15:09, 22 March 2007 (UTC).     [ edit ]   Continued   Just for chuckles, I think I should point out that I have never stated my credentials, and I hope to never do so. I have a  job  that some people assume implies those things, but I have said very, very little about that, wish I had said less, and Giano is an absolute cypher. He has never indicated so much that he  has  a job, much less what it is, and even less where he went to college and how long. The point being that, unlike quite a few people -- and particularly the people demanding to have us respect their authorit-ay, neither of us, and certainly not Bishonen, either, mentions credentials. We point to our  work here at Wikipedia,  which is a different thing, and then only, as Bishonen says, in exasperation. Since I arrived here, I've been annoyed by the pop obsessed younguns at Wikipedia shouting ""amen"" to each other. To me, this is a fight over whether we have articles on these subjects, not whether we have FA's on them. If we get articles on them, they're eligible  if  they can be properly discussed and analyzed. 90% of the time, they can't.  Geogre  11:43, 22 March 2007 (UTC)             Well, neither you nor Giano is listed at  Category:Wikipedians with PhD degrees , so that's good.  Utgard Loki  16:13, 22 March 2007 (UTC) M.S.                           Is there a category for ""You will have to work out for yourself whether this Wikipedian knows anything about anything""? --  ALoan   (Talk)  16:49, 22 March 2007 (UTC)                       What an enormity that is! A category populated by people using userboxes to self-identify their academic credentials is wrong on so many levels that one scarcely knows where to begin. I want an ""it's the work, and it's always the work"" box.  Geogre  19:51, 22 March 2007 (UTC)    Oh, and I should have added a P.S., above. Yes, I am an elitest in many ways on content, but that's because I'm such a firm believer in the power of The People. Because I believe that the aggregation of humanity can achieve great things, I think it should never be allowed to settle for half-assed spitballs shot at the screen. I have never believed that anyone or anything ""is owed"" an article, nor that any contributor automatically has the right to write whatever she or he wishes. Everyone should write encyclopedic content, and I think everyone can. Therefore, ""Mikey is a footballer with Slovak Spartan B Community Cultural Center Extension club"" is bad. I would be insulting the author if I said, ""That's all he can write and all he has to write.""

Don't be so silly Bishonen, it was erected by the Indian Government (circa 1979) to provide a photo-shoot opportunity for the late Princess Diana, and also as a place for very unlovely, and usually ugly people to pose for what they imagine are romantic holiday snaps to bore their friends with at home. The latter should be banned from being photographed anywhere, in fact they should be made to put plastic buckets on their heads when leaving their houses - so they don't spoil other people's photographs taken for the architecture.

[ edit ]   Again   Having trouble with another admin -  Mel Etitis  - who thinks you are not allowed to delete things from your talk page.  Rarelibra  20:55, 22 March 2007 (UTC)     You're not entitled  to remove  comments by other users from article talk pages, if I understand this correctly.  El_C  23:39, 22 March 2007 (UTC)    This had to do with my own talk page.  Rarelibra  01:10, 23 March 2007 (UTC)    Ah, I stand collected.  El_C  03:41, 23 March 2007 (UTC)             Bishonen - are you saying now that I  cannot  delete the conversation from my talk page once it is complete? Because as far as I am concerned, it is complete, and there isn't anything derogatory or incorrect with me removing it...Â ?  Rarelibra  01:10, 23 March 2007 (UTC)     No, I'm saying you  can , but it's  rude . That's not such a mysterious idea, is it? Some things are allowed but are nevertheless derogatory. You won't get punished for them, but they won't do anything for your reputation, either. Lots of things are like that in  real life , right? For example, it's not illegal to speak unpleasantly to your neighbors, but it's not nice either. That's how it is with this. To uphold your reputation, to be pleasant, the optimal way to handle your talkpage is to leave stuff on it until you archive the whole page (or archive all but the most recent of itthat's what I do). Replying to messages is nice too. But none of us are always nice, I guess /looks through own talkpage, blushes slightly at sight of roaring dinosaur sockpuppet/, especially when the other person is being rude. I'd hardly bother to reply to a template, I must say. I might even remove it, with an informative edit summary. But it would take a lot before I removed a real human message.  Bishonen  |  talk  01:47, 23 March 2007 (UTC).    That's where we differ, then. I have been military for 20 years... thus, I learn the ""regulations"" and what is ""permissible"" (plus, operate on the oh-so-popular ""better to ask forgiveness than to ask permission""). I'm quite sure that if I met someone in real life and had a discussion, then found out our ""wiki"" identities, I wouldn't change my real-life opinion of them (I see them as separate). But I am also a person who doesn't care if I ""step on someone's toes"" as long as I am within the rules. So whether or not it is ""rude"" is all within perception (but a permissible perception! that is why I kept attempting to correct the admin, and solicited your support). He tried to  insist  that I  must  keep it on my talk page, when I knew that I didn't have to. You see, my poison is that I am intelligent and operate on logic... thus, the neighbor example for me is that when my neighbor's dog took a dump in my lawn, it is logical that they should have just cleaned it up (I don't own a dog, so it is extremely obvious). I shouldn't have to knock on the door and ask nicely, nor remind them (as it is a duty of owning the dog)... so my answer? I put the crap in a plastic bag and attached it to their doorknob. Problem solved, and surprisingly no more dog crap in my lawn... am I worried about my ""rep"" with them? Actually, NO. Do looks of distaste bother me? NO. If that makes me rude, so be it (it isn't against the law to be so!). If I remove a human message it means (1) that I read it, (2) that I no longer need it (unlike what I have archived or saved currently - for projects or problems I am still trying to finish, or research, or work out), or (3) that I don't care for it. Does that make me rude? Maybe. I don't care what people think about what I do as long as it is within the law/rule. The times I am outside or violate, I am humble enough to ""take my lumps"" and admit my mistakes (as I have been blocked for 3RR, etc, of course). So if a guy with a short haircut comes up to you in Chicago and tells you to ""put the &$*#! cigarette out"" in a harsh tone while you are puffing away underneath a ""no smoking"" sign, well... it's probably me, and I don't care if you think I am rude.Â :) So don't take it personal, but I think the conversation is done and I will probably clean my talk page.Â :)  Rarelibra  02:15, 23 March 2007 (UTC)    That suits me. I've been in academe for x years, learning to go by logic and analogy, and I have some trouble with yours. You give several examples of how you think it's proper to be rude  for a reason , yet round off your message with rudeness for no reason: telling me the conversation is done, as if I had been needlessly bothering you with my unsolicited opinion. That's more like telling a person chewing gum under a no-smoking sign to put their &$*#! cigarette out. I don't take it personally, you understand, it's just the logic of it.

[ edit ]   Keeping sewage out of the wine   Hi - I'm interested in any comments you (or anyone watching this page) have concerning  User:Rick Block/Keeping sewage out of the wine . It's an essay, there's a talk page, I assume you know what to do. --  Rick Block   ( talk )  04:45, 23 March 2007 (UTC)     [ edit ]   Wikipedia talk:Attribution/Community discussion       Shortcut :   WP:ZN       FYI. I'm posting here because we have orders from on-high to make this as widely known as possible, and this is a well-watched User talk. It's both a ""proposed"" and ""already done"" merger of V, NOR, and RS. It occurred, and then got held-up when Jimbo got involved. Long story. Five months of editing to slog through. But I'm sure of interest to people.  Marskell  21:58, 24 March 2007 (UTC)         I have neither the time nor the energy to read all of that, can we just have a brief (very brief) synopsis of the outcome - altogether too tiresome and fruitless to join these discussions.  Giano  22:43, 24 March 2007 (UTC)               OK, as briefly as possible:  Wikipedia:Attribution  is a merger of  WP:V ,  WP:NOR , and  WP:RS , originally suggested by SlimV, and subsequently worked on by a few hundred people. Reasons: ""verifiability"" is actually a misnomer; V (a policy) relied on the often sloppy RS (a guideline) for its explanations; NOR and V are outcomes of the same question, viz. ""can this be attributed to a reliable source?""; one page instead of three will be enormously easier to manage.               Long story begins when Jimbo notices five days ago. Slim had informed him and the mailing list last October, but it was forgotten about apparently. Jimbo has requested: ""a broad community discussion on this issue"" ( here ) followed by ""a poll to assess the feelings of the community as best we can, and then we can have a final certification of the results"" ( here ). Note, ATT is not meant to change policy at all, but to make it more concise and maintainable.  Marskell  12:37, 25 March 2007 (UTC)         ""V - RS - NOR - ATT"" somebody please explain to me what he is talking about.  Giano  14:21, 25 March 2007 (UTC)     I suppose it's the duty of the hostess. WP:V, WP:RS, WP:NOR, WP:ATT are shortcuts to pages in Wikipedia space, namely  Vandalism  Verifiability, Reliable Sources, No Original Research, and Attribution. It's quite touching to see the country cousin trying valiantly to get his bearings at the party!  Bishonen  |  talk  15:00, 25 March 2007 (UTC).        I don't bother to read all of those things, if one wants to stay up to date one would have to read them allevery day, as someone is always tinkering about with them, then I would not have time to write anything. Just tell me when it is all sorted out, then I will shout if I don't agree. I never use hiroglyphics or symphonics or whetever daft English word it is to describe all this initial talk  Giano  15:09, 25 March 2007 (UTC)                           Sorry. I have just linked the shortcuts at first mention.  Marskell  16:55, 25 March 2007 (UTC)                       As ever, the questions are in the  uses  made of policy, not the wording. If someone goes along to say ""all articles without references should be deleted,"" that's a huge mistake and a massive case of dickishness (esp. when there are thousands of really, really, really, really, really offensively bad articles that wouldn't be caught because, while they say that Fubbies Magic Pills are the greatest things ever, they link to Fubbies Magic Pills website or Mikey's Fan Favorites Web Guide or someplace...or even a spam site). OR is not lack of sources. OR is OR, and lack of sources is lack of sources. Instead of spendingÂ :30 to go on the web to research ""Oh yes, it's real, so we should KEEP this article that says 'Timmy is a cricket player',"" let's spend that time getting educated and evaluating sanely and carefully the inherently POV and blind reviews. Let's, while we're at it, not go around fact tagging articles that say what is found in  every  reference.  Geogre  17:35, 25 March 2007 (UTC)                   ""All articles without references should be deleted"".  User:Worldtraveller  actually advocates this exact idea on his user page: ""Delete all articles which are unreferenced, six months from now.""                       ""OR is not a lack of sources."" Indeed. I like the latest sum-up on this: ""Although everything in Wikipedia must be attributable, in practice not all material  is  attributed."" (One of Slim's nuggets.) Of course, what happens in practice is indeed more important than what the pages say; policy should reflect  best  practice, not general practice. Over the now nearly six months of debate re WP:ATT, putting to rest the descriptivist argument (""well hey, people already cite Usenet, so why shouldn't policy let us cite Usenet?"") was one of the hardest parts. At one point, people were considering writing a weakened exception for pop culture articles into the policy...*shudders*.  Marskell  18:23, 25 March 2007 (UTC)        in my earliest wiki-days way back in May 2004 (a life-time ago) I used to write a quick page to fill a red link and never add references (it was not required) unless it was what I think of as a ""proper page"" - and I still stand by every word I've ever written, and if I could remember all the pages could easily find references to support them. However, I expect somewhere in all those pages I have given the odd architect the wrong Christian name, or have a date a couple of years out. I do not think those pages should be deleted - but I know what I am talking about ( said modestly ) a lot of editors here do not; and that is a problem. I hesitate to disagree with Geogre but I can see where ""World"" is coming from on this one.  BUT  let us be quite clear I do  NOT  think every verb needs to be linked directly to a page number - because that is meaningless. I frequently (Hannah springs to mind) use reference books that were printed 80 or 90 years ago in very small numbers - how easy would it be to cite ""Crewe Vol III p 245"" who could hope to check it - without the help of a very flexible credit card? (Incidentally there were only two volumes of that work) - so my point is there always has to be an element of trust, which is the reason I was so angry about the ""Essjay affair"" - otherwise we are going to have to say if a reference book is not currently in  W H Smith  it is ineligible for citing on wikipedia. I don't know the answer - and if I do, I don't like it because it will spell the end of wikipedia being theÂ !encyclopedia anyone can edit"". I post this here because my days of arguing are over, no one ever agrees with me anyway  Giano  19:36, 25 March 2007 (UTC)                                           (butting in uninvited...) Giano, I completely agree, and your experience mirrors mine exactly. Indeed it looks like we joined around the same time (me in April), and my earlier articles are still unreferenced, though I stand by every word, most of which is pulled from books in my library which I accumulated while getting my (verifiable!!!) doctorate. I don't quite know where to jump in on the ATT discussion. Bishonen, is your experience similar? A lot of us did a lot of writing three years ago which is still quite good, should not be deleted, and will be tedious to reference ... but I'm going to start doing it soon. Cheers all,  Antandrus   (talk)  19:43, 25 March 2007 (UTC)                                                   As far as Worldtraveller's User page goes, I'd sum it up as an idea to light an enormous fire under Wikipedia's ass. I appreciate the sentiment, even if I disagree with the specifics. Regarding Giano's sentence on trust: here I agree fully. There's an enormous element of trust in other users required to judge an article under review (at AfD or FAC or whatever). I don't think it healthy or unhealthyit's inevitable, and I see it as one element of  RewardReputation  that the project requires. But it's fraught with a lot of difficulty given the nature of Wikipedia and it's emphasis on ""anyone."" Essjay is the obvious example, but you can find a smaller example everyday. Antandrus has a ""verifiable"" doctorate. Well, I don't know that. I don't know who Antrandrus is. S/he doesn't know who I am. (Not to be picky Antandrus, just using an example in front of meÂ :).  Marskell  21:51, 25 March 2007 (UTC)                       My view is that  all  pages should have a list of references which will verify the facts on the page. If a fact is contraversial, outlandish or a very new theory then a specific cite to its source should be made. The Pope is a Roman Catholic; William I fought at Hastings in 1066 and Palladio was an unfluential architect do not need to be specifically cited, just a book which agrees with those facts mentioned in a reference section at the foot of the page is sufficient. Credentials for the anonymous are meaningless so lets not have them at all.  Giano  22:20, 25 March 2007 (UTC)         Good point about the books, Giano. (Some ways up. As usual, everybody and their aunt has already posted by the time I've written some reply to somebody, in this case principally to  Antandrus .) Some of the people advocating coverall inline citing seem to assume that that would mean any editor will then be able to check any fact with a mouseclick. I don't have any sources as exclusive as yours, but you may remember I've written  an FA  which is principally verified through  books  written in  a language spoken by 9 million people . That page contains quite a few counter-intuitive and surprising facts. They're cited, yes, but, in practice, nearly all readers are going to have to take what I say on trust anyway. And that's  with  me following all the rules. Anyway, no, I don't think I'll weigh in, Antandrus. I'm too slow and laborious a writer to do any good in a big free-for-all. It really bugs me when I spend half a day penning (keyboarding) a paragraph, and 15 minutes after I post it, somebody like geogre replies with two screens of much more cogent arguments... grrrrr... ROARRR... where Tokyo!? ... sorry, where was I? I appreciate Marskell turning up to sing a siren song [/me ties self securely to mast], but I'm trying to write a sandbox article here, and there are enough interruptions without diving into the  Wikipedia talk:Attribution/Community discussion . Not planning to FAC it, no... I'm tired of FAC. It's not so much verifiability issues in my case, as the tone on FAC altogether. (One reviewer, when I took issue with what seemed outright hostility, assured me that it was nothing personal, simply the FAC culture nowadays!) And the joys of ""having"" a FA  in the sense of being scolded for laziness if you don't ""maintain"" it, and scolded for ""ownership"" if you do  are definitely overrated anyway. Being the main contributor to an actually controversial article, which mine are not, must be far worse in this regard, too  it's got to be ""You don't  own  it, you know!"" and ""The main contributor hasn't bothered to maintain it!"" all day long. Altogether, writing FAs can too easily turn you into a common criminal in the eyes of others. How many times has Giano, who never even mentions his massive FA contributions, been told that he expects, nay, demands, a ""free pass"" (pah!) because of them? Nice little wrinkle, that, don't you think? Anyway, an article's an article, with or without the star. If it's good, it's a good contribution to the encyclopedia.  Bishonen  |  talk  22:33, 25 March 2007 (UTC).         Could not agree more, at the end of the day, a FA is only a FA because a load of people (many of whom never write a FA) say it can be, likewise it can be FARCd because the same people say it can't. I an tired of aruging with these people let them run the FA side of things if they want to. At the end of the day anything on Wikipedia that is good is good and anything less is usually appalling. Like many people I can recognise the good pages without having to look for a silly little star - so who needs FAs?  Giano  22:43, 25 March 2007 (UTC)           If, as we recognize, it's all a matter of trust anyway (and it is), and if a number of us from the old days routinely wrote true and good articles and didn't try to thumb through the books we've read to cite them, then we're up against the fundamental bullflop of it all. The people waving the flag of ""verifiable or die"" don't know the subjects and so cannot understand when a thing needs verification and when it doesn't. An article on a massively well understood subject like  plot  would be stupid to cite, unless it is reporting a fringe understanding or the historical development. Every reference in the world will say that it is the connection of actions in a narrative. Every reference in the world will say that it is a structural element of narration. However, people who have never read a single reference in the world will ask for a citation, and in the process they might miss it when the author goes off on a Roland Barthes 1956  Structures of the Short Story  jag -- which should be cited, as it is a part of  Structuralism . My point is that if it's just ""they say you can, so you can,"" ""they"" need to be worthy. If they're not, they'll demand when they should be quiet and be quiet when they should demand. They'll miss the made up print reference. They'll have no sense of what is credible and what is not. When brand new information gets written, our New Page patrollers sniff the air. ""Jimmy is a successful businessman"" can be speedily deleted or not based on how likely, how credible it is, not whether Jimmy's fan put in a citation or not. If the patroller is uncertain, he goes to Google. The point is that every part of Wikipedia works by credibility, interrogation, and trust in tension, and it depends upon a dynamic balance between them. It only works with  educated  judges, though, whose education is up to the matter being reviewed. If that's Jimmy's business, the level of education necessary for a valid judgment is one place, and if it's Hollaback Girl's prescience, it's somewhere else, and if it's an FA on Heisenberg, it's another place again. No one minds, so long as they feel that the readers have sound judgment to tell good from bad. I have no confidence in those judges most active at FA right now to know good from bad academic material, as they have  demonstrated  ignorance of language and content.  Geogre  03:22, 26 March 2007 (UTC)    Sigh. ""Willy hears you. Willy don't care."" Ok. Well, in case what I said, above, is obscure, I will try one of my many ""essays"" to try to make my position clearer. It's persuasive, or at least I'm convinced, so perhaps it'll have the same effect on others at some point.  Geogre  23:20, 27 March 2007 (UTC)    Am I Willy?

But yes, to the best of my belief there is something like a form to a fill in, and there are right ways and wrong ways of doing it... to make sure the permission sticks, for good, I suggest you contact a Commons admin who knows what's what.

Geogre  23:18, 27 March 2007 (UTC)    Technically, being an archangel, you would be a flying deletionist, so Loki could well be the last standing one. -- AnonEMouse   (squeak)  17:39, 28 March 2007 (UTC)    Sorry for the pettifoggery, but your description of the archangels' physical etc. properties might be a little oversimplified (see  Angel#Appearance_of_angels ). Not that I'd give a flying whiff... Oh and for the record, should there ever be a contest for the title of last deletionist standing, be it known that my candidature stands eternally. But I digress.  Kosebamse  19:00, 28 March 2007 (UTC)           Well, I tempt mortals into deletionism, so perhaps I'm the heresiarch of deletionism? I suppose  user:Wile E. Heresiarch  gets that title.

(Why walk, when you can flyyyyyy, man?)  Geogre  21:25, 28 March 2007 (UTC)     Ok, then how about  Swedish War of Liberation  getting ""cite"" tags slapped on it. Isn't the information in there known to everyone who has ever cracked the spine of a book and looked for it? Do we need to cite information on things recorded by  every  source?  Utgard Loki  17:37, 28 March 2007 (UTC)     I have removed that template with an argumentative edit summary. [71]  Now give me a vandalism template, please. {{blatantvandal}} will do.  Bishonen  |  talk  17:47, 28 March 2007 (UTC).    Without arguing the point of whether they're required, hopefully they're useful.  [72]  -- AnonEMouse   (squeak)  16:17, 29 March 2007 (UTC)    How is that useful? How useful is it for one encyclopedia to refer to another? Why not just use flippin' Google Books, if that's your goal? How many citations do we need for 1492 sailing the ocean blue? People need to read and consider the things where a citation is actually  needed  as opposed to where a tag could go. By throwing these things around like popcorn in the theater, we make the tag meaningless and leave ourselves with nothing to reach for when an article is actually making controversial and outlandish claims. I do Random Page all day. I see idiot articles about Mikey Greatest of All Kids and it has a ""cite"" tag on it. That should be a speedy delete (A7), but it has the ""cite"" tag. So, is the need for citations on that the same as the need for citations on  Battle of Shiloh ? If you want a concrete example of a Mikey with ""cite,"" I can give you one.  Utgard Loki  17:21, 29 March 2007 (UTC)    Because those articles are more thorough than ours is, so someone who wants more information now has a specific place to go. ""Go crack the spine of a book"" is not very specific. I reached over and cracked the spine of a book just now, and didn't find anything at all about this war, it's hardly WWII. I needed to be guided to the right book. Those articles have actual bibliographies, which, again, ours doesn't. I can't just copy and paste the bibliographies out of them, because I haven't read those books, but I can refer to it indirectly this way, because I have read the articles. Eventually our article will include all the information in those articles, including bibliographies. Until it does, I humbly propose these links are useful, and I'm not saying anything about Mikey or 1492.-- AnonEMouse   (squeak)  17:32, 29 March 2007 (UTC)           Yeah, there has been a real  zeal  to put ""cite"" and ""pov"" tags on things. I saw a saint article that had a ""this is not written with a neutral point of view"" tag on it. Well, um, it  is  hagiography. The moment you have a hagiography, you kind of have a POV inherent in the job title. Then big obvious bits of history are getting ""cite your sources"" on them. It's so easy to apply a tag and so hard to read an article, I guess.  Utgard Loki  17:53, 28 March 2007 (UTC)       Back to deletionism. I think the articles themselves, like  Melf , do the best job of persuading.

[ edit ]   personal attacks   Here is the ""in a nutshell"" summing up of the policy on no personal attacks.         This page in a nutshell:  Comment on content, not on the contributor.       How can a section called ""Davkal"" posibly be anything other than a forum for discussing me rather than content I have added. It is not even called ""Davkal's recent edits"" or ""davkal's POV"" but simply ""Davkal"". That is, we are now going to comment on the the subject ""Davkal"", ie. a contributor. And this is clear breach of the policy on personal attacks. Please refraion from such attacks.  Davkal  11:57, 1 April 2007 (UTC)     Ah, alack, alack! Betimes an  account  is editing destructively or tendentiously and administrators have to soothe, counsel, or intervene with such an account holder. Therefore, a discussion of a person's online  habitus  is necessary from time to time, and if the goal is to best and most peacefully manage rather than ""attack,"" there is the fulfilling of policy  mandate.

If someone puts vandalism like that and it is a first offence, what template do you put on? I have just started with Lupin's vandalism tool, as i do not have enough edits for VandalProof  Themcman1  16:32, 2 April 2007 (UTC)     They blanked substantial parts of two articlesmost of  Gay , in fact. It's a first offence, well, that's true, but it's also pretty much the first thing they do at all. The account has only seven edits altogether. That makes a difference, and I definitely wouldn't go with simply {{Uw-test}}. I guess the person lives in Truro... lol. Your notion of test 2 sounds all right to me. I think I may have gone a little overboard with the {{blatantvandal}}. That's assuming that the Truro edits are good, and not sneaky vandalism. It's hard to tell, all the way from here.  Bishonen  |  talk  16:47, 2 April 2007 (UTC).    Why do the vandals attack the article on the author of  Trivia (poem)  and  The Beggar's Opera ?  He was a man much more sinned against than sinning -- gentle, erudite, clever, and the most done-by man in the epoch (excepting the really famous cases like  Christopher Smart  and, one supposes,  Richard Savage ).

What you said was nothing like what you say now.  Bishonen  |  talk  20:15, 4 April 2007 (UTC).    Ah, I see what you mean. Bish, I changed a sentance that was talking about problem users in an attempt to make clear that it was not just problem users that were being targeted. By leaving in place too much of the old sentance, the result was not what it was supposed to be. Well, oops. You saw the rest of the changes that I made in the same edit. You know I was around when it all happened, and that I put an oar in. Did you really think that I would have suddenly changed my mind and decided that the targetting that happened was beneficial? Regards,  Ben Aveling  08:30, 6 April 2007 (UTC)                   You seem to have a beef with me, Ben, but I don't quite understand what it is. If your edit didn't say what you meant it to, don't you think it benefited from  my rewrite ? But I was mainly focused on adding stuff, that the text (not yours, but the original text) swept under the carpet IMO. For instance I figured it was wrong to mention the kickban powers of the ops without mentioning that they had been abused. (I still don't see much point in mentioning them at allthe whole thing is rather too detailed IMObut if they're in there, it shouldn't be in an uncritical way.) Heck, I'd been around rather more closely than you, you know? I'd been kickbanned for nothing, mobbed, I'd had the ""pleasure"" of hearing my absent friends trashed as bad users and as a net minus for the wiki. (By the chanops themselves.) No, I didn't think you suddenly changed your mind, but I couldn't tell you'd written the opposite of what you meant, eitherI'm sorrry, but that sort of thing is hard to know, and generally clear only to the writer. I never expected you to resent having me input more accurate information and/or fixing up your sentence that (as I now realize) said the opposite of what you meant. I still don't understand it. Would you agree my edit was an improvement? Did you notice Tony Sidaway immediately reverted my version back to yours, and does that suggest anything to you? What is the problem? Please be more explicit. Was my edit summary tactless (""jumped on"" you?) If so, I'm sorry, it wasn't meant to be. I just wanted to explain my changes.  Bishonen  |  talk  12:30, 6 April 2007 (UTC).                           The page is vastly improved. I was actually a bit hesitant to edit it in the first place, because I didn't know if I would be opening a can of worms. But I didn't want to leave it as it was either. The problem I had with your edit summary, which you did direct at me (""Ben, ..."") was that it seemed to stop just short of accusing me of lying (""truth trumps NPOV...""). Now when some random troll accuses me of something, that's all so much water off a duck's back. But when someone I respect has a go at me, well, it hurt. Anyway, shit happens. Apology offered, apology accepted. Let's move on. ObOffTopic: Have been reading ""White Death"", Robert Edward's book on the Russian/Finish war; very interesting.

I like to nuke things, but if someone is using it as a userpage joke, it might be protected as parody.)  Geogre  11:50, 5 April 2007 (UTC)    It's a good fake if it is one: it looks dodgy but the pixels match up very nicely if you zoom in on it.  Le Pen claimed that he had lost his left eye when he was savagely beaten during the 1958 election campaign. Testimonies suggest however that he was only wounded in the right eye and did not lose it. He lost sight in his left eye years later, due to an illness.   Yomangani talk  11:59, 5 April 2007 (UTC)           Yet in the pictures of him on the french wiki, his eyes seem just fine. If it's correct and not doctored-up, that's just fine. It just looked QUITE dodgy to me, and since there _is_ a campaign on and he _is_ a major candidate, I thought we should be careful, after all.

What intrigues me is how on earth did you come across the message that I left at  User talk:Tad102 ? If anything that shows some pretty dedicated ""user contributions"" sleuthing there!   Do you know Tad102? Having a look at his log and edits worries me a bit - he might be harming the project unintetionally. First was the unecessary blanking of  Wikipedia  when he really should have just removed the vandalism. But also there is a whole series of ""Fair use"" images and screen captures that he has uploaded  [74] . These appear to have almost universally attracted criticism for unjustified Fair Use criteria but this fact didn't seem to stop him. In fact, he appears to get quite angry when anyone does anything he doesn't like (such as the message you linked to me) and also  here .

But your english is very good - even for a swede. My guess is that you weren't raised in Sweden, am I correct? As for the followup edit to  wikipedia , I don't think that had anything to do with any vandalism, it was just the removal of that, admittedly, rather strange box at the top of the article.

I don't want my flesh singed by my employer, because I change jobs a lot, and I'll run out of room. (Oh, and the article is written in authentic business gibberish and high cant.

Sorry, but they have not granted me  the flamethrower , so I cannot fix it. Remember: fire is the cleanser.  Utgard Loki  13:20, 10 April 2007 (UTC)    I'm not joking: I honestly can't figure out what employee branding is. I know it's not marking their flesh with a hot iron, but, beyond that, it  seems  to be that... that... workers become known as ""X workers"" and therefore have a corporate ethos so strong that all who work there are subsumed into the ideology and bear it upon their general identity.

Have you tried asking  User:Fred Bauder ? See, I've already blocked  Hahahihihoho  indefinitely once, and when he appealed to the Arbitration Committee, Fred unblocked him for another chance at responsible editing. I've been watching some, and know he's been causing trouble. But if he has altogether squandered his second chance, it should really, logically, be up to Fred, or the ArbCom generally, to re-block indefinitely, this time for good.   OK... (checking) I see you have written to Fred. (Er, why do you say Alkalada is a  meatpuppet  (=a friend)? Surely he's Hahahihihoho's  sockpuppet , i. e. the same person?) Fred's only been not-editing for about a day. Maybe it can wait till Fred returns and responds? Please get back to me if that takes more than another day or two, or if Alkalada edits so disruptively that he must be stopped right away.

(I digress a bit on that, might seem a lil emotional) So anyway, I took a lil break and apparently this Ideogram guy is going to want to destroy me on wikipedia. I guess this is the end huh? To be honest with you (and everybody else who is reading this), deep down, I always knew this moment will arrive. Things will escalate out of control and the LionHeartX/RevolverOcelotX/Guardian Tiger/Apolystic Destroyer (s) or whatever hes called right nows fan community will show up and devour me. If thats the way it is, I got no regret, only that I will make sure to tell everyone that pedia is not a reliable source to gather information. Remember the 1st time we met? You called me a vexatious litigant and a pest (that description seems to fit Ideogram right now) and kicked me out of AN/I. After so many months of your tireless mentoring, I really put in a lot of effort to reform and tried my best not to disappoint you. Now, Im saddened, even more disappointed when Centrx put a 1-second unjust punitive block in my block log, when the checkuser for Guardian Tiger got turned down, when David Levy blocked me for that UI spoofing episode, when LionHeartX got unblocked, and when Viridae blocked me for 3RR by accusing me of violating the spirit but no the actual rule while Ideogram walked away unharmed even though he violated 3RR himself (only to self-revert after seeing I have reported him). If you dont want to get involved in newly-filed arbCom case (more like a personal attack forum against me), I can totally understand your reasons. (Ideogram and Sumple insulted you, maybe you should get Zilla involve ) But I will really appreciate if you can make a fair statement/assessment on the arbCom case.

[ edit ]   Your opinion if possible   Hello again, its been a while (the Yeti and and the trials of turning 50). This note is regarding [[Carnedd Llywelyn] (its ""legendary"" mountain in Wales) and its spelling. Yesterday I supplied a broader set of citations and references (probably overkill but they can be removed by consensus), what we have is a user, with opposed views (which is ok) who has deleted nearly all of them and has supplied some quite heated remarks. The citations/references were added to support the notion that the name of the mountain and its spelling/history is not soley confined to the Welsh speakers, writers and local publications. The citations consisted of original work done in 1200 appx (when Llywelyn was alive), the Royal Geographical Society a few other none Welsh books and white papers from Journals. I didn't write much more that one sentence in the article, but just about everything was deleted by the one user. Could you take a look at the last version by Gowron and see if I have been ""ridiculous/stupid"", if I have I the fair enough. P.S. I did complete more detailed work on the Yeti which seems to have been accepted, so thanks the comments there also. Best regards.

A person flooding us with the complete genealogy of the Arbuthnot family has now decided that, not having contributed anything to the article, it is simply unconscionable that it remain in ""American"" English, and so we have yet another mid-Atlantic goulash to ""regularise"" those spellingss.

Please unprotect, Geogre.  Bishonen  |  talk  02:39, 17 April 2007 (UTC).     I have. Essentially, I thought I was dealing with hydra accounts to achieve the aim (edit warring and gaming 3RR). Since I had been on the talk page and presented a case, it seemed to me that reverting within seconds by many hands was useless and needed to be stopped. As it turns out, the accounts doing the British spelling for Grand Little England were not new accounts, and I was mistaken. I maintain still, however, that this wretched desire to go through and simplistically say ""This person was British (when the United States didn't exist at the time, so there was no option) and so I have to change the spelling to a form that the person himself or herself would never have used because, in the middle of the 19th century, some British folks found reforms practiced by Americans but thought of by British folks and American folks to be non-U"" is tantamount to not only childishness but an attack and an edit war. The number of arguments against a change (aside from ""status quo is always better than any unreasoned change"") are endless, and those for are ""a thirteen year old last year worked in a bit like this in the MoS and I can't read very well.""

Since you seem to have all sorts of disagreeable people agreeably at your talk page (among whom I count myself), I thought I'd throw this out.

Karah Parshad  is good info IMO, except that the reference to  Ghee  (clarified butter) as ""oil"" seems to be a mistake. Oh my, though... the first thing is to redirect the identical articles at  Karah Prasad  and  Karah Prashad --sigh--and write a note to the creator of all of them... groan. OK, I've done that.  Karah Parshad  is the most common form on Google, so that gets to be it. How about you remove the how-to bits and make a nice little stub, hmm? Mind you, sampling  Category:Sikh terms , which was how I spotted the duplicates, I notice much worse problems with some other articles there. Maybe you'd like to take a mailed fist to the non-standard formatting of such as  Sewadar ? Move the quotes to Wikiquote, for instance.  Bishonen  |  talk  15:03, 17 April 2007 (UTC).     I have done both, but I still regard these as highly suspect, especially ""sewadar."" That seems to be no more than a dictionary definition of a foreign language term. I don't see any way that it differs from ""volunteer."" At any rate, I handled the quote with my usual delicacy.  Utgard Loki  16:09, 17 April 2007 (UTC)     [ edit ]   Guilt by association   Hi there Bishonen. Wonder if you can help me with this one?   I've been engaged in a debate over content at the ""Allegations of Israeli apartheid"" page. Specifically, I have objected to the inclusion of unsavoury characters like Idi Amin, white supremacists and holocaust deniers being listed as supporters of the apartheid analogy alongside reputable people like President Jimmy Carter and Archbishop Desmond Tutu. It looks to me like a clear use of  association fallacy , or loosely speaking, guilt by association.   I initially objected on the grounds that people like Idi Amin and David Duke are not reliable sources and that therefore they should not be quoted, but my opponents argue they are not being quoted  as  reliable sources, but merely ""catalogued"" as people who have used the analogy. I've tried to find some means of clarifying the issue in Wiki policies and guidelines but without any luck.   Is there something I've missed, or are there no effective policies on who can be quoted in an article?   Also, I can't help noticing in my travels other instances of logical fallacies in articles, like  poisoning the well  for example. It occurs to me that perhaps there should be some sort of Wiki guideline discouraging the use of such tactics in editing? Because this sort of thing really drags the quality of some articles down in my opinion.   Thanks,  Gatoclass  10:24, 18 April 2007 (UTC)     I wasn't asked, but the only defense is in the text itself. There are people who make the analogy simply as a figure of speech (the white supremacists) and those who make it as an analogy (Jimmy Carter). The former would  also  include any number of ""shock jocks"" and far right wing talk show hosts in the US. What they're doing is looking for any term of accepted evil and adding it to ""Israel"" to try to make their attack. It's not much different from ""Islamofascist"" in that regard: ""fascist"" plus ""thing you don't like."" It's not a comparison at all. Instead, it is just a figure of speech in an attack that reflects no more consideration or  political philosophy  than ""Republican Party Darfur"" would.   To try to defend against the Aspberger's-like impulse of Wikipedians, you have to work inside the article itself. There is no way to stop Wikipedians from lists that I've seen. They love lists. They love lists of lists. They love category tags with lists of category tags in a box and template. Whether the people here are just doing the Wikipedian obsessive compulsion or trying to winkle in some  argument by analogy  (or guilt by association), the best thing I can think of would be a heading. ""Political theorists"" making the analogy and ""public figures using the term."" The latter could include the clowns. The former would contain only a few people.   If you do that, the actual list mongers should leave it alone. If they don't leave it alone, if they want it all mixed into a stew, then you have pretty solid grounds for defending the article from them. FWIW.  Geogre  11:03, 18 April 2007 (UTC)           Hey, I like lists too ya knowÂ :p               In general I agree with your proposal. While I really don't think such characters should be listed at all (I mean, does the reader really need to know that the usual bunch of antisemites have jumped on the bandwagon?) my primary objection is that these crackpots are interleaved in the text with the more credible critics, which has the effect of making them  all  look like a bunch of kooks. So I've been trying to think of a way to categorize them separately myself.               I'm not sure that ""political theorists"" and ""public figures"" would work though, because someone will probably argue that's an artificial distinction. One would think there'd be  some  way to categorize them separately, but I just haven't quite managed to think of one yetÂ :)  Gatoclass  12:01, 18 April 2007 (UTC)                   ""Treatments of the theme"" vs. ""Uses of the phrase?""

I shouldn't have, though, because I did not spell it with  contemporary  British spelling. I don't know why I keep writing these things with  mistakes  in them! Then again, the man's entire career was in England, but he died in what would, 100 years later, be the United States, so maybe he can be spoken of with the spelling natural to me.

We'll see how much protest there is for an A1 speedy delete getting overwritten by a stub on a Jesuit prodigy.  Geogre  20:19, 19 April 2007 (UTC)   Adventures of a new article: I'm glad that there are people paying attention. However, the article immediately gathered up a ""fix"" of removing the apostrophes marking plural dates (this is not a correction, folks; I use the same style sheet as the  NY Times  and several grammars; taking out the apostrophe is not only an Americanism, but it is a vulgar Americanism (i.e. many American systems still require them, and I'm one)) and a tag saying that few articles link to it. Given the fact that the article is brand new, I'm not surprised at that. However, I also don't think many articles  will ever  link to  William Rainborowe . He is interesting as an example of a great many things, but there isn't a constellation of related individuals to discuss and link back and forth from. I suppose I could invent some link forms. The point is, is the article less worthy for that? Usually, the ""few links"" means someone is making something up (like ""J-ball funk"" or some other protologism), so it's a useful bullshit detector, but in the case of important but obscure (it's possible) people, it won't be indicative. This is the difference between a blind and sighted application of a tag.  Geogre  01:30, 20 April 2007 (UTC)       I'm thinking we should open an RFC on the Manual of Style itself and what it means.

That doesn't mean it's an abusive sock puppet. And even if it were one, that doesn't mean the template's supposed to be used as a brand of shame. And even if it were supposed to be used for that purpose, that would even so be the wrong tag for an IP. See  WP:SOCK  for when and how to tag.  Bishonen  |  talk  19:04, 23 April 2007 (UTC).    Thanks for the link Bishonen, I already know how to tag, see my contribs. I'll go tag it with {{ Indefblockedip }}. -- Iamunknown  19:05, 23 April 2007 (UTC)    I know why Elonka is trying all she knows to get at DreamGuy. Is there any special reason you are? If it's a ""moot point"", why insist on doing it?  Bishonen  |  talk  19:10, 23 April 2007 (UTC).    I tagged the IP with {{ Indefblockedip }} because it is an indefinitely blocked IP and should be categorized as such, should it not? -- Iamunknown  19:13, 23 April 2007 (UTC)    There's no necessity, no compulsion, and no profit in it in this case. I explained above why not, but you're obviously not interested. You'll make a fine admin.  Bishonen  |  talk  19:31, 23 April 2007 (UTC).    I do tend to tag things and clean out backlogs robotically. -- Iamunknown  19:33, 23 April 2007 (UTC)    You'll make a robotic admin.  Bishonen  |  talk  19:51, 23 April 2007 (UTC).    Which is not a good thing, and something I would rather not be. The anon is requesting unblock right now and, frankly, I'm quite surprised it was indef blocked in the first place. I haven't followed the convo, but it doesn't appear that DreamGuy was using sockpupets to get around blocks or the 3RR rule or anything, it just appears he or she was using that IP address for whatever reason. Granted, the IP is being kind of disruptive but I might be if everyone were blocking me and tagging me and stuff. -- Iamunknown  19:54, 23 April 2007 (UTC)    You say that and still you tag. Cute.  Bishonen  |  talk  20:53, 23 April 2007 (UTC).    I'm confused now. I infer from your last comment that you are annoyed with me, and from previous comments that you disdain my actions. Why? What have I done? -- Iamunknown  22:07, 23 April 2007 (UTC)    You' re confused? What about me? You tag the page. You chirpily ignore my pleas and my reasons for  not  tagging it. You agree that your action is likely to further goad an already beleaguered editor. (""I might be if everyone were blocking me and tagging me and stuff."") You say you don't want to be the kind of person--or admin--whatever--who does that. But you still don't remove the stupid tag. Why do I disdain such a spaghetti of contradictions? Gee... I really don't know how to explain it.  Bishonen  |  talk  01:07, 24 April 2007 (UTC).                                                   (outdent) I see where you would be confused. I wish we could have gotten off to a better start. Our first interaction that I am aware of was at  Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive223#User:BassPlyr23 removing ifd tag from Image:1972 Israeli Olympic team.jpg , on IRC after that and then here. I was unfortunately beside myself in that first discussion, feeling frustrated with what I perceived as an attack on those who tag images for deletion which, incidentally, includes me. Regardless what I perceived, however, my conduct there was inappropriate, as you noted on  irc://irc.freenode.net/wikipedia .   Now we meet again in less than favourable circumstances. I sometimes do, admittedly, edit robotically. I find that I like repetitive tasks. Why? Maybe because a lot can be accomplished in a little amount of time. I happened to come across incorrectly tagged user pages earlier last week and then picked up on consolidating or otherwise applying templates to them (for the bulk of my contributions, see  this ). When I was browsing through the administrator's noticeboard I noticed the discussion you started titled ""Spontaneous block of DreamGuy by David Gerard, please review"" and I poked around a bit. I applied {{ tempblockeduser }}, [78]  as it was appropriate at the time and, as normally, I left the page on my watchlist. Next I saw it it had changed quite a bit, with your revision being the most recent one and the IP indefinitely blocked.   My first comment in this discussion on your talk page, I realize in retrospect, was inappropriate given what I should have said. When I wrote, "" Removing the {{ Blockedsockpuppet |DreamGuy}} is a moot point now; the IP address is indefinitely blocked "", I should have said something like, "" I see that you removed {{ Blockedsockpuppet |DreamGuy}}. Are you aware that the IP address is indefinitely blocked? Should it be tagged with {{ Indefblockedip }}? "", or something to that effect.   I originally was taken off-guard by your comments because I had difficult inferring what you meant. I see now that by stating, "" You'll make a fine admin. "" and "" You'll make a robotic admin. "", you were not suggesting that you approved of what you think I will become, but that you think what I will become is something undesirable. I agree to an extent. Being robotic is, arguably, necessary when clearing out large backlogs; it is not, however, appropriate when dealing with real-life editors who, as human beings, can and may be hurt by what you or I say or anyone else may say in correspondence.   I apologise if my correspondence with you has been muddled and confusing. Unfortunately my correspondences sometimes are; I may occasionally have erratic behavior including, but not limited to, getting riled up, being obstinate and posing questions more than replying to them; I would like to think, however, that I also am willing to listen to others' opinions, discern between what types of tasks should occupy my time, correspond civilly and collaborate with other editors and seek forgiveness when I realise that I am wrong. I realise that my side of our correspondence has, since the beginning, been inappropriate. I definitely need to work on that and, in general, work on appropriately communicating clearly and civilly with other editors. I apologise for my inappropriate correspondence on ANI and here, and I hope that you will forgive me. Yours,  Iamunknown  06:02, 24 April 2007 (UTC)           OK, cool.  Bishonen  |  talk  18:11, 24 April 2007 (UTC).    Sigh , I wish that you would believe me. -- Iamunknown  00:26, 25 April 2007 (UTC)    Good catch! But that doesn't refer to you. I do believe you. My bookmarks aren't secret messages. I was thinking of using that article to write an essay in Wikipedia space, that's all. Wikipedia is full of bad-faith apologies. How many times have you been told essentially ""I apologize but it was all your fault""? Yeah, me too.  Bishonen  |  talk  00:37, 25 April 2007 (UTC).                     Something appears to me to be wrong with this block and page protection. See my comments on the IP's talkpage. I am hesitant to unprotect the page, if not unblock, only because the situation seems so odd that I am concerned I am missing something.  Newyorkbrad  21:05, 23 April 2007 (UTC)     Only thing you are missing is that a small but very active group of admins (and ex-admins, in Tony's case) completely threw out any pretense to follow  WP:AGF , normal dispute resolution steps and other Wikipedia policies.  DreamGuy  23:05, 23 April 2007 (UTC)    Yes, well, you guys missed the second RFA for badlydrawnjeff. The Oppose votes were shocking. They honestly opposed on the basis that he would follow the rules. I'm  not  joking. They thought his view that IAR is wrong must be denied, and a couple even said that hopefully there wouldn't be any admins insisting on rules anymore. Again, this is not hyperbole.

What are you talking about? - who is blocked? Anyway I'm done with Buckingham Palace and all of them - they can do what they like to it. I wash my hands of the FAs, I cannot be bothered to have yet another round of abuse with LuciferMorgan or anymore of his ilk, there is Ideogram wittering away about me elsewhere - Oh is it him that's blocked? - I thought that was yesterday or before - anyway I leave them all to their own devices.  Giano  21:16, 25 April 2007 (UTC)       No, it was someone else. I meant that we weren't seeing the usual screaming and extremism -- at least yet -- and ruefully predicting that it would come back as soon as the blocked people came back. How dare we authors protest when these experts at ""what makes an FA"" tell us that we have not pleased them? Do we not know that footnotes are mandatory and that an article on  Pop Tarts  with superscripted numbers running to 100 is a proper FA, even though every one refers to a website run by the company, while an article based on deep reading and years of study that uses parenthetical references for a discussion of  Linear B  is obviously not featured material? It isn't the words that matter, after all, or the quality of them, or the discussion, or the depth, or the value of the words that ""makes a Featured Article"": it is the  form.  Soon, we may be able to do without authors altogether and just have ""auto-content"" templates for Featured Articles.  Geogre  02:24, 26 April 2007 (UTC)        Well when one reads this ""  ....the assertion that Buckingham Palace was deliberately targeted by the Germans in WWII was sufficiently challengable to require an inline cite  "" when the fact that two bombs at different times fell slap bang in the middle of it resulting in the famous ""I'm glad we've been bombed, I can now look the East End in the face"" comment. in my opinion is evidence enough that it was targeted - anyway I'm not playing those games there.

Some of the articles in question are  Bigfoot ,  Ta Leoni , and  Erotica , with some lesser but still problematic edits to  Slash fiction  and  Adult theater . It's pretty clear he had to have been following my edit history as it's not at all likely he has all of those on his watch list, and I only got to some of them by hitting the random button and then occasionally following links on those pages for more to clean up. It appears he hasn't reverted them again after I noticed what he was doing, warned him, and reinserted my edits.  DreamGuy  21:47, 27 April 2007 (UTC)   And he's back to leaving nasty comments on my talk page, continuing to blind revert all of my edits (and any edits made by editors who came after me) on  Werewolf ,  Dilbert ,  Bigfoot , and probably others too.

What mountains of this rubbish we have!Â :-( That's a copyvio. I found the first paragraph  here , though not most of the rest. My guess is that the wiki article and the metronometech site were ripping off the same book. Curiously, another page I was looking at,  Systems thinking , was in the same condition: I found one paragraph on the web, at an  essay mill site  but not the rest; and yet the whole thing is written in exactly the same way. I'm cynical, I don't for a moment believe that whoever-it-was merely lifted one paragraph somewhere and wrote the rest himself.   So, I tried to prod 'em, but ran into trouble. I haven't used the PROD template before, like I said. It worked fine yesterday, but now I can't get it to display my reason! I must be doing something wrong.... except that I'm doing exactly the same thing as yesterday. Aren't I? It's {{subst:prod|reason}}, right? What's the scope for getting that wrong?

If I remember correctly, however, prod has trouble with embedded external links -- trying to add 'em can often cause them to look screwy. My usual solution is to simply not add the brackets to the EL, but you can also use this syntax too (which has the same net result but might be a bit more reliable:  {{subst:prod|concern=REASON}}  If neither of those work, however (or if you're not trying to use an EL), just drop the exact string you're trying to use here and i'll take a look.

Bishonen  |  talk  17:36, 29 April 2007 (UTC).     [ edit ]   POV pushing/edit war   I could use some outside input on  Dissociative identity disorder  -- there is an editor there currently dead set on trying to hide the fact that the diagnosis is controversial, depsite there being a full article on why it is controversial (and in fact trying to use the existence of that article to rationalize why the main article shouldn;t even mention the controversy). He has also been extremely aggressive in edit comments on my talk page and there and is simply reverting without trying to make any efforts to understand policies or acknowledge problems with his version. My version may need some rewording, but it's clearly more accurate than his.  DreamGuy  19:45, 29 April 2007 (UTC)     OMG, there's a  content fork  about the controversy? We hatezzzzz them. I think the first question has to be whether that article should be merged (back?) into the DID page. I've posted about it on  Talk:Multiple personality controversy , to begin with. IMO we're unlikely to see any consensus about the DID page as long as there's a separate controversy page. Its existence invites exactly the kind of arguments you describe there.

KillerChihuahua ?!?  23:23, 29 April 2007 (UTC)   Adding: thank you for the compliment on my garden, however honesty compels me to point out that you see only the parts I post, which are, of course, the pretty parts - not the parts which are suffering from drought, disease, or neglect.

Do you think we should take him to arbCom?? Thanks-- Certified.Gangsta  01:02, 30 April 2007 (UTC)     Oh, lord, CG, I can't stand it. I'm sorry, you're on your own with Lionheart's edits, I'm not going to read them. Prolixity is his sharpest weapon. It hath magical powers: it putteth the reader to sleep. Also, well, I don't quite know how to put this, but if the arbcom sanctions you, which is looking likely, they'll be kind of predisposed to a rather negative view of view in any case you might bring in the immediate future. It's not a good time for it, I'm afraid.  Bishonen  |  talk  02:51, 30 April 2007 (UTC).    If I can jump in, the best plan would be to ask an administrator who has subject-matter knowledge of the pages that are being edit-warred over to look in on those pages and make sure things are in decent order. (Please don't look at me, as I don't have the relevant subject-matter expertise.)  Newyorkbrad  02:59, 30 April 2007 (UTC)           [ edit ]   My Talk Page   You posted this on my Talk Page:   I notice that Real96 has asked you many times to not post on his talkpage again. Your continued and increasingly aggressive posts in the face of that are beginning to look like harassment. He was trying to help. Don't post on his page again, please. This includes non-apology apologies and other amusement. No posts at all. I mean it. Bishonen | talk 01:43, 30 April 2007 (UTC).    I am curious: (1) how do you define ""many times""? I counted exactly once. But, I could be mistaken. Please direct me. And (2) how would it come to pass that you owuld ""happen"" to notice all of this? That strikes me as odd. And raises my suspicions. Thanks for your input! I await to hear from you! Thanks! ( JosephASpadaro )     Oh, good. I'd love to hear all about your suspicions, do please detail them. If you think you'll be able to move smoothly from trolling a young user who did nothing but try to help, to trolling a Wikipedia administrator, you'll find you're mistaken.  Bishonen  |  talk  02:40, 30 April 2007 (UTC).           Hi! Thanks for your reply! But ... I see that you neglected to answer BOTH of my questions. Shall I repeat them? Please let me know. Thanks! ( JosephASpadaro  03:56, 30 April 2007 (UTC))                   Four times. Real96 deleted your posts with an edit summary requesting that you take your concern to your own page for discussion  here ,  here , and  here . He requested the same on your page  here . I saw you post repeatedly on his talkpage because his talkpage is on my  watchlist . The watchlist shows edit summaries, and the increasingly distressed tone of his, as  here , alerted me that something unusual was going on. Notice the  blue  words in this text? They're  links . In order to understand what people say to you, you're supposed to click on the links in their text. This is a superior method to  pestering  them for information already contained in the links. Now don't post on this page - my page - again unless you'd like to be  blocked  for trolling. And in the future, if you suspect me of keeping an eye on your contributions, it'll be because I am. Please interact constructively with other editors.  Bishonen  |  talk  07:55, 30 April 2007 (UTC).           Bish, thanks for your help. This maybe a  troll  or a new user who is confused.

I knew that Ugajin was not a vandal at all and I immediately realised that I had made a mistake and removed the vandalism warning message from his userpage. For the note you suggested me to write, at first, I had thought about writing one, but I then had realised that he hasn't created a userpage nor does he reply to any of his messages so I thought it wasn't necessary. Anyway, thanks for the feedback. --  Bhavesh.Chauhan   Message Me   |   Contribs  02:40, 3 May 2007 (UTC)     Hi, Bhavesh.Chauhan, I hope I didn't come across as too reproachful. I thought you might need alerting to the error (though now I see I was wrong), and that Ugajin would be unlikely to write to do it. FWIW, while he doesn't reply to messages, he does read them. I noticed that with  this message of mine , where he immediately stopped adding the mistaken categories and started cleaning up the ones he'd done. Good luck with the VandalProof, I'm sure you're doing good work with it.  Bishonen  |  talk  09:47, 3 May 2007 (UTC).       [ edit ]   Whoa!   That's a big raccoon!!

I've been monitoring it lately and it seems that most ""open informal complaint[s] about misuse of administrative powers"" end with citations of ""this is not the Wikipedia complaints department"". I previously considered AN/ANI to be user-friendly, but it certainly doesn't seem so. (I could try to find specific discussions if you would like.) Anyways, that was my thought process, no need for a resounding ""No."" in your edit summary. Â :P -- Iamunknown  03:36, 4 May 2007 (UTC)     This is not the Wikipedia complaints department, unless your complaints and/or departments relate to racoons and/or more timid critters.

It was deemed that tagging  ChrisGriswold 's main account as a 'puppet master' was excessive and should not be done. But the other accounts are suspended and were used primarilly as tools by  ChrisGriswold  to deceive and abuse other Wikipedians. Those tags on those accounts should stay in place and not be removed.  SpyMagician  23:06, 5 May 2007 (UTC)     His name is on the puppet tags too. Sorry, but I won't play along with any quest for vengeance.  Wikipedia is not  a  pillory .  Bishonen  |  talk  23:11, 5 May 2007 (UTC).    See my talk for my thoughts on this matter. I'm not prepared to edit-war over it, but I agree with Bishonen.  Newyorkbrad  23:12, 5 May 2007 (UTC)    This was not and is not a quest for vengance. It's quite unbelilevable that someone who was an admin and who would have done what he did is being protected in this way. If yu are going to characterize my desire to keep the tags on the sock puppet accounts as a 'quest for vengance' how would you descrbe  ChrisGriswold 's initial desire to create these 'sock puppets'while an adminto abuse others? You're defending someone who ruined the lives of others. Asking those tags stay in place is nt vengance. It's simply right.  SpyMagician  16:04, 6 May 2007 (UTC)    He  ruined lives ?

Dmcdevit  t  10:26, 6 May 2007 (UTC)     Just reading it, thanks. You didn't know about that? What a pity. Yeah, the nicest thing I can say about LionheartX's editing is that he probably doesn't realize the disruption his flooding and spamming and repetitiousness cause simply as such. When he got going at the CG-Ideogram arbitration case, I ended up taking it off my watchlist  it was too irritating to constantly find yet another post from him with nothing new in it at the top of the list. What it must be like to be in his sights, as CG is, I don't even like to imagine. As for banned, Ryulong has deleted Lionheart's userpage, presumably on user request. Do you know if that means he's supposed to have left? I'm sure you'll agree that a move like that, even if sincerely meant at the moment, really shouldn't be taken as case closed and no banning necessary.  Bishonen  |  talk  10:53, 6 May 2007 (UTC).      Thanks for the heads up, I've commented. I know this seems pointless and abstract to us, but these people represent two nations with a non-zero chance of going to war in our lifetimes so they both forget civility sometimes. Regards,  Ben Aveling  11:26, 6 May 2007 (UTC)     I wasn't talking about Lion's editing in mainspace, in suggesting there's simply too much of it. On talkpages and in Wikipedia space I believe he's way beyond ""forgets civility sometimes.""  Bishonen  |  talk  11:43, 6 May 2007 (UTC).    Agreed. But likewise for Certified. All the best,  Ben Aveling  12:21, 6 May 2007 (UTC)         BenAveling, you are hardly a neutral voice here. Ever since Guardian Tiger was banned, you deliberately attempted to classify me and Guardian Tiger (and his socks) in the same category when I am getting harassed and brutalized by him since last summer. Maybe you should spend your free time on improving the actual encyclopedia rather than teaching ban-evading sockpuppet how to wikilawyer his way out of a community ban. You are being counterproductive and disruptive to the project, not to mention this blatant lie.  [84]   User:Dmcdevit  is the admin who proposed the community ban with no opposition. Banning LionheartX is strictly a case of policy enforcement especially with these new instances of disruption.

Giano  21:49, 9 May 2007 (UTC)           I've looked. Essentially, this is a wholly inappropriate external link that this editor wanted actually in the article. By being noisy and obnoxious for a good, long time, he got the talk page participants to toss him the sop of an external link. This, to him, is consensus. The link is not related to the concept of law, and I suspect it may even be clumsy page rank boosting. If Bishonen doesn't keep it gone, I will.  Geogre  22:47, 9 May 2007 (UTC)       [ edit ]   Alkalada again   User:Alkalada  has continued the moment his block expired.   Also I hate to see  this . After Alkalada kept attacking and insulting another Slavic Moslem user calling him  a traitor  because he did not want bad for the Serbs, he wrote "" Dude, answer me your fucking dickhead.

So, I took that away because I knewed I made a misstake and please dont repeate that all the time.   As for my edits, I have invited you to the talk page in every single edit I made and I will also post sources which I will find today and put it in the articles. If you want to talk then talk to me and in the talk pages, dont talk with the moderators, if you want to point out, then good, say it to me at the talk pages and lets find a solution which will take both evidence and veriability in account.   Okey?  Alkalada  15:41, 10 May 2007 (UTC)     [ edit ]   ""I thought I'd better hit you before he did. He's in much better shape.""   Hi, Bishonen. That quotation (which I hope I've produced accurately) is from  High Society , and probably also from  The Philadelphia Story , when the heroine, who is due to be married the next day, behaves imprudently with a man, and her ex-husband knocks the man down, in front of her furious fianc, and then whispers those words to him, as he helps him to his feet.   So what's the relevance? It's my request that you'd keep an eye on poor Gordon. Gordon really doesn't mean any harm, but he just won't stop arguing and arguing and arguing, and he annoys people, and knows it, but doesn't seem prepared to try and change. I've thought of that quotation several times in my recent dealings with him, feeling that it would be a kindness to block him for 24 hours, just to prevent someone else from blocking him for a month. Though of course I recognized that it wouldn't be a valid reason for a block! So I wasn't asking you to unblock him, but just to try and make sure that things didn't get worse for him. Gordon likes to have the last word, and I'm sure he found it frustrating when people would post to him that he was wrong, and that if he argued that he was right he'd be blocked.   I have no complaints with what you did. I think it's more than likely that the anon was Gordon, though if he says it wasn't, I'll believe him. If he asks me to unprotect, I'll unprotect. I think he got a bit of a raw deal, and he was definitely goaded after he was told he wasn't allowed to argue for his links.   Sorry I'm not around more. Hope all is well with you.  Musical L inguist  13:59, 10 May 2007 (UTC)     Pretty much. But I don't get it about Gordon's block. According to the log, he was last blocked for a month on March 13. [85]  Nearly  two  months ago. And yet he hasn't edited since, except his Talk. (Or he was, he's not editing at all now.) That may not be a bad thing.. but how does that work?  Is  he still blocked? I don't see any active autoblocks. Anyway, you're missed, ML!  Bishonen  |  talk  21:54, 10 May 2007 (UTC).       [ edit ]   Lost and forelorn   My God, where ARE you?

Dr Zak  04:32, 15 May 2007 (UTC)               [ edit ]   re: Wikipedia: No personal attacks   In my continued efforts to  resolve the conflicts  at  WP:NPA , I have discussed another potential compromise version with the editors active on the policy's talk page. That version, located at  Wikipedia:No personal attacks/Proposal  has been tentatively accepted by those editors currently involved in the discussion. However, I would value your input as to whether this proposed policy satisfies your concerns.   Obviously, it is impossible for the policy page to be perfect. As has been noted in the talk page discussion, there is no way to write a policy that will prevent editors  on either side of the debate  from taking extreme positions in regard to actual content or its removal. But as one of the editors involved in the rejection of the previous attempt at promoting a compromise version, I would like to hear from you before I consider contacting the protecting administrator regarding promotion of the proposed version.   Regards,  Serpent's Choice  04:44, 14 May 2007 (UTC)     [ edit ]   Hello   Thank you for taking the time to  spam  me (your words! not mine!)Â :)Â :)Â :)   First, I would like you to thank you for clarifying that I have not done any significant posting on AN/I.   I have no desire to post frivolous or spurious charges on AN/I, nor wast admins' time.   I believe I have opened requests there twice (not positive), once because I was told that I should; and once because I truly felt harassed, due in part to the creation of false SOCKS and SUSPECTED SOCKS pages against me and then being followed around when I tried to get help. I'm still spinning up-to-speed on wiki policies and procedures.   I think your proposal is a good one, and alas, I too think it is doomed to fail. As you appear to have been keeping an eye on things, you're clearly aware of the frustration and tension and the promises made and broken. I've even attempted compromise and agreements myself.   For my part, you don't even have to ask. I have no intention of filing AN/I complaints against any editor, unless recommended and supported by a neutral admin. As I said above, my recent call for help, was in self-perceived desperation at being publicly accused of something I was not doing. Having seen far too many games being played with logs and out-of-context citations and lists of frivolous NPA, CIVIL (etc) warnings, I could only imagine the huge fabrications which could be made of my initial Lsi_admin account. (by the way, could that be deleted please? thanks).   I do believe that some editors here are intent on POV editing, but as an admin pointed out ""that will be shown over time through logs"". It is not something which can be established by one or two dozen edits. I, for one, have no desire to have my username associated with controversy and spurious allegations of crying wolf.   I am here as a neutral party, with only NPOV interests. You might notice a recent 3O opinion that I gave in support of a citation as RS which I believe supported Smee's position. (I saw a 3O request in my field of expertise and I gave an NPOV opinion based on that industries perception.)   I do acknowledge personality conflict and I have been looking inward to understand why I am reacting instead of responding. I have been embarrassed more than once after taking a break and coming back to see what I had typed. It is not a pleasant experience to return and see that I have let it become personal.   Obviously you felt the need to leave a message on my userpage, and thus I have clearly stepped across the line of what you consider reasonable. For that I do apologize.   I'm assuming you are not requesting that I never post any responses to anything on AN/I but are only suggesting that I not participate in cat fighting. For that you have my assurance, regardless of what any of the others do.   Best Regards, Peace in God.   -john  Lsi john  21:03, 14 May 2007 (UTC)   ps: I also invite you to hold me to a  higher standard  of conduct. Please feel free to box-my-ears and recommend that I go get a cup of coffee, any time you feel I am not editing from a clean space. Thanks again.  Lsi john  21:10, 14 May 2007 (UTC)          A cup of coffee for Lsi John.         No, I did not mean to imply that you've edited inappropriately. I'm concerned about the way you're placed, rather than about how you've edited. The reason I included you in the Gang of Four is more that I feel an undertaking from you would make it easier for the others to agree, too. Sorry to be treating you as a  burnt offering , and do have that coffee in any case. I took a look at the ""Lsi admin"" account--first I've heard of it. Accounts can't in fact be removed from the database, I'm afraid. Userpages can, though. Normally, the associated user  talk  page will not be deleted, only the userpage. This is for the sake of the History... still, the very existence of that talkpage was a newbie mistake, and if it's important to you, I will delete it.  Bishonen  |  talk  21:57, 14 May 2007 (UTC).    I'm content to claim the title offered by  User:Krator  using the userbox ""reformed vandal"", as long as it isn't going to be used against me. My first (and only?) edit, using that account, was made without any knowledge of the existence of a large wiki-community. My concern was when it recently got tagged as a SOCK and ABUSIVE and whatever else was being tossed around due to 'admin' being in the username. I've since realized that admins look and see those charges for the silly nonsense they are, but at the time I didn't know that it was simply a psychological game being played.   As for 'how Im placed', I'm not sure and I won't ask what you mean. Its not important. For the record, I'm not a Scientologist and until yesterday didn't even realize that Scientology was different from Christian Science (I'm not familiar with CS either).   Thank you for clarifying.   Peace in God.  Lsi john  22:17, 14 May 2007 (UTC)         I'm sorry that I didn't specifically address the usertalk page issue. I was addressing what I believed to be the issues where I had specifically been involved. My request that you  ""pull me up short""  was intended to be a catch-all for  anything  I might do on-wiki that you find objectionable. I was attempting to close the door, not leave it open, by giving you the full right to decide if I had broken the spirit of your proposal.   For clarification: I will not engage in gossip and baiting commentary on any userpages about any other users. Specifically, I will not participate in conversations with JA on either of our userpages where we are discussing the actions or any perceived adjenda of Smee or Anynobody.   I was going to post this on your consolidated report, but decided that it would be more appropriate for you to update your own report, if you feel it needs updated.   Lsi john  15:28, 15 May 2007 (UTC)     John, your ""catch-all"" and your all-round good intentions were clear to me, and I meant to make them clear on ANI as well. I'm sorry you think there was room for misunderstanding. Perhaps I overdid the concisenessI had an uncomfortable feeling I was using up too much ANI space as it was. I'll copy this statement to your page. Is there anywhere else you'd like me to put it?  Bishonen  |  talk  18:00, 17 May 2007 (UTC).    Sometimes this text medium just plain sucks. I was only trying to clarify that I felt that I had addressed the user-talk page issue with my 'catch all'. Anyway, discussing it further makes it seem more important than it is. Why is it that 80% of our time is spent on 20% of the material?Â :) Peace.  Lsi john  18:38, 17 May 2007 (UTC)           [ edit ]   Thank you ...

Bots signal people, and the people are the ones who want to be ""fixing"" things, not the poor schlubs who used the images. Notice how this one is working, though. The bot goes through and then tells the person  using  the image that it must be deleted. This is backwards. Let the person holding the leash give the command for the dog to bite, and not let the public beware that the dog bites everyone unless the owner can be persuaded to hold it back.  Geogre  18:58, 15 May 2007 (UTC)       [ edit ]   ANI   Bishonen, I just read this  Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/Incidents#Proposal__to_some_editors_of_Scientology_articles . My observation is that otherwise patient admins become cranky and impulsive from the sheer volume of complaints on ANI, be they justified or not. I think ANI should be abolished and incidents be dealt with pages specific to the type of incident or with individual admins. I think ANI is a bad idea period.-- Fahrenheit451  17:22, 15 May 2007 (UTC)     Thanks for your thoughts. Dividing ANI into separate subpages according to subject is a proposal that comes up from time to time, not least because it would make it easier to watch subjects in one's specific area of interest. Still, I suppose it's felt that there is value in a system that encourages everybody to eyeball everything, because so far none of these proposals have made much headway. The place for you to write up your suggestion would be the joint talk page of AN and ANI,  Wikipedia talk:Administrators' noticeboard . I have to say that's not a very lively or widely read page, though. There is currently a somewhat relevant thread on it, ""AN/I is too long"".  Bishonen  |  talk  17:35, 15 May 2007 (UTC).

What his bot is doing  is  appropriate. Working in a sandbox is fine. But, what should be done is that the images you want to be used should be linked, rather than actually displayed. If you need an image for sizing purposes, then use  Image:Example.jpg  and leave a note to yourself in the code of the sandbox pointing to the actual image, when you are ready to go live to mainspace.   Lots and lots of people use sandboxes. The problem is two fold. First, our policies prohibit the use of fair use images outside of the main article namespace, and there's no exception for sandboxes. Second, lots of people's sandboxes become old. Where do we place the cutoff on allowable fair use? 10 days? 30? 60 since last edit? The Foundation has made it policy that the cutoff is not to allow them at all. -- Durin  18:23, 15 May 2007 (UTC)                 Well then the Foundation is a fool! and Durin "" profanity "" nasty word - please do not be so bourgeois it sets my teeth on edge.

NO! They do not - just the image police here who fail to assess the situation clearly. Look at the picture and make an informed intelligent decision! God gave you a brain.  Giano  20:10, 15 May 2007 (UTC)           I don't suppose anyone would appreciate my sense of humor if I said ""Giano, your remarks assume facts not in evidence and are original research""? Maybe I've just been editing too many contentious articles. It all just struck me as amusing. Carry on. I've probably managed to annoy both of you, without really intending to annoy either. I'm good at that.

Durin was merely explaining the justification for removing images from editor's sandboxes...that's all. -- Iamunknown  20:28, 15 May 2007 (UTC)               Not a personal attack at all, saying ""fucking"" is a ""profanity"" in certain circles is considered bourgeois, if to be bourgeois is an insult, that is not my problem.  Giano  20:32, 15 May 2007 (UTC)    I guess...most people would probably consider it profane. You did seem to speak with disdain towards Durin, I guess that was what I was sensing, though that is not really a personal attack (but it is rather uncivil).

But do you seriously think that anyone is going to care enough for that image (an ancient Cunard poster) for it to be a  real  problem - as distinguished from being identified as a problem by the kind of petty bureaucrat who likes to stick little labels on things, tick little boxes on their voluminous forms, and scold others for breaking their ever-expanding list of rules?   And, yes, Bishonen said a naughty word. I'm sure she will wash her own mouth out with soap later. Perhaps the bot will now also be feeling contrite, and can be programmed to say a few ""Hail Mary""s and ""Our Father""s? --  ALoan   (Talk)  20:37, 15 May 2007 (UTC)     Please don't lecture me on how to speak, Durin. Ponder the distinction between using profanity  at  Eagle 101, and using it  while  talking to Eagle 1. Has the Wikimedia Foundation decided that even a miniscule saving of time for a bot, or a human image removersaving themselves the trouble of looking at the History to see whether a sandbox is actively edited outweighs a great inconvenience for a content creator? And that deciding a cut-off point is too.. I don't know.. taxing? That's rather discouraging for writers, though it may make bots happy. Thank you for the information, though. BTW, you'll all be glad to hear that  User:DreamGuy  has discovered new dating information, retagged the image, which is actually PD, and reverted the bot. Great work, thanks, DreamGuy!  Bishonen  |  talk  22:23, 15 May 2007 (UTC).           I think Durin's request that you be civil was very reasonable, your use of profanity was uncivil.  High InBC (Need help?  Ask me )  22:27, 15 May 2007 (UTC)         P.S., my message was directed at Durin and DreamGuy, not at the jury converging on this page. HighInBC and Iamunknown, could you please go share your running commentary where it's more appreciated? Do I keep popping up on either of your pages and give my opinion when you're trying to have a conversation? Well? Do I? Well, then. Please desist. I request it as a courtesy.  Bishonen  |  talk  22:49, 15 May 2007 (UTC).     If you allow me to quickly butt in, lady and gentlemen, I did a little online research and discovered  this website  which, as you see, displays the poster in question and also features a slightly different,  black & white version . I have contacted the webmaster, who has confirmed to me that this poster was originally printed in the US in 1921 and the artwork was also featured in postcards (the b&w version happens to be one, in fact). Apparently, the 1922 mods could have not been appreciated in this sectional view, but anyway, the {{ PD-US }} tag is therefore correct. I have also been pointed that all this can be confirmed by consulting the book  ""The Cunard fleet 1840-2004""  by Elspeth Wills. Hope this helps to settle the matter for good. Cheers,  P h a e d r i e l  - 01:32, 16 May 2007 (UTC)    (PS. Bish, this may also mean you'd probably have to correct the reference in the article at your sandbox, since the black & white image appears as dated in 1913 there. That could have not been possible, as the sectional view clearly shows the oil tanks at the bottom, and the Aquitania was converted from coal to oil-burning on December 1919. Hugs!Â :)  P h a e d r i e l  - 01:45, 16 May 2007 (UTC)    You  are  clever! Thanks very much, Phaedriel. Yes, the ""1913"" was more a sandbox guess, I wasn't intending to say such a thing in mainspace. I'm going to ask for the b&w postcard version to be deleted, since a better version exists. I don't suppose  you  are a Commons admin, hint hint?  Bishonen  |  talk  00:34, 17 May 2007 (UTC).             Wow. I had no idea anything here would escalate into people throwing poo at each other, but then some people on Wikipedia seem to forget this is an encyclopedia and not some social clique with enemies and allies. For the record, I am 100% behind the idea of following all copyright laws to the best of our ability (and I thoroughly disagree with Giano's comments above about how the law is malleable -- no, not in most copyright cases it isn't), but I think bots and people going through tagging tons of images clumsily isn't really a good way to do it either. Whenever I see bot activity on some page on my watchlist (and Bish's was from leaving some comments recently) I like to double check them. That's why I tried to look into this one, because it looked old enough to me to be public domain, and it turns out it is. I appreciate Phadriel taking the time to come up with definitive evidence of that. On another page on my watchlist that same bot happened to get something right, so I went and cleaned up after it and removed the image from some other pages it didn't belong on either.  DreamGuy  03:43, 16 May 2007 (UTC)     Gosh, he said poo. Where are the language police?       Anyway,  pace  DreamGuy, the law - and more particularly its application to a particular set of facts - is seldom as clear and definite as he may think. Even if this was an infringement of someone's copyright, would they bother taking any legal action as a result? I rather suspect not. --  ALoan   (Talk)  09:45, 16 May 2007 (UTC)    Someone not bothering to take action (either because they don't know, don't care, or can't afford to sue in every single casse) in no way makes the action legal or moral. And it is pretty clear cut, as a matter of fact.  DreamGuy  22:12, 16 May 2007 (UTC)           I had a rather definitive statement, but it got lost in the section that didn't become a hotbed. I agree with Giano that law is not a binary operator. It is not ""legal/illegal."" If it were, the world would not be infested with lawyers. No, law is an  activity  and not a  state.  It is an action, an interpretation, a process, and not a simple attribute. As such, it requires people and minds, and therefore any -bot approach is wrongheaded.  People  have to look. A bot has to flag the bot operator to go  assess.  As Giano says, we are supposed to have brains, and we have to use them. The bot need not flag the person who last edited a page with an image on it, even though these devices were introduced to warn  uploaders  that they had missed a bit. Instead, it needs to flag the person wishing to make a change -- the person wishing to delete an image's placement. Then that person has to think and judge and then  communicate  as a person. It cannot be automatic nor automated.  Geogre  15:19, 16 May 2007 (UTC)       [ edit ]   Friendly Neighborhood Lurker   Hey there, Bishonen.

Giano  21:56, 16 May 2007 (UTC)                   Speak for yourself, I was never that young. Why aren't you online? I saw you withdrawing  Harriet Arbuthnot  from FAC, but apparently you're not to have any control over it. Hmm. In that case, I rather wonder why ALoan bothered to ask you before he nommed it. Creating content is no fun any more, I agree.Â :-(  Bishonen  |  talk  00:34, 17 May 2007 (UTC).             Well it seems to be back on FAC but attracting little interest, I was actually withdrawing it because I was furious at an incident in another section of FAC where the footnote citing zealots of FARC where complaining a page was over footnoted - so I was pointing out that they cannot have it both ways. If you ere thinking of a return to FAC I would advise against it.   I think my next submission will just be the footnotes and refs with no text. That should meet the criteria very well. Sadly people don't seem to realise that one can make a series of refs and quotes say anything you want them to. In fact my next page using refs will factually and accurately with full cites show that Wellington was a bisexual psychopath who defeated Napoleon because he was perverted pornographer and Wellington wanted to further his own base sexual gratification. The whole of the Napoleonic wars were series of amorous adventures. Napoleon a noted philanderer <true> having traded his wife in for a younger more sexy model<true> raided Europe collecting pictures of naked ladies <true>. The Italians were very cross <true>, because they were their naked ladies <true>, conspired to help overthrow the pornographer Napoleon <true>, in the meantime Wellington who had moved into Napoleon's sister's house <true> (he had seen a statue of her naked on her sofa <true>) stole Napoleon's mistress <true>). Napoleon was so cross he escaped from Elba <true>. During the ensuing battle of Waterloo <true> which we now know was over a ownership of a mistress - Wellington placed the man who stole his brother's wife in such a position he had his leg shot off <true>. Wellington won the battle and then returned home and wooed the most Mrs Arbuthnot <true> as a result of his success with her she gave him a good write up for posterity in her diary <true> Once Wellingtom had the good write up Mrs Arbuthnot suddenly died <true>. With undue haste Wellington formed a relationship with Mr Arbithnot instead <true>. The two men set up home together <true>. The couple (as they now were) lived together until separated only by death<true> All of that could be reliably sourced and no one could deny it because it would all be reliably referenced - which is why we need authors to sort the refs and explain them -I just wish someone would explain that on FAC.  Giano  09:53, 17 May 2007 (UTC)     Heck no, I wasn't thinking of a return in that sense, my last nom was kind of traumatic. Or maybe I traumatize easily, I dunno.

The image had {{pd-old}} on it, and it obviously came into existence 150-200 years before copyright even existed, but there it had been not  tagged  but actually  removed  by a brainless bot. The result of the -bot's actions is that a person with a wild hair who wants tags to be  just so  is leaving to people like me, who neither know nor care about the very latest fashion in tags, the change that he thinks is essential.

I have two rebels today. First, we have  Allan Stewart (Jacobite) . He was, uh, a Jacobite, but of the Rob Roy sort.

I do, indeed, and not the nice and devout and great poet. I never like it when I confuse the hasty historian with the perspicacious poet, but I do so regularly.

Geogre  21:15, 17 May 2007 (UTC)             Yes, of course, or rather that he had it good as a carpenter, so he needed to tend to his trade and wait for the Labour government to come to power in a few hundred years. Also, he seems to dislike not the uprising, but the  flavor  of it. Poor fool! Didn't he realize that socialism wouldn't work? It's just so  tiresome  that none of these people before Marx had learned that!  Geogre  21:13, 17 May 2007 (UTC)     And your Jacobite has already received ""cleanup"". It's a pity that people will refer to an actually helpful small edit in such a hackles-raising way. I bet they wonder why there's no gratitude.  Bishonen  |  talk  21:20, 17 May 2007 (UTC).    Well, in this case, I don't mind. There was another article already -- under a name that had set up zero redirects, so I couldna find i'. It's an article that leans entirely on the web for its information, and on Stevenson, so it has some rosy romantic glow to it. Mine should probably be the bulk of the article, but I don't mind if one of the others does the merge. I think I'm not supposed to do the merge, as I might be tempted to merge via fire and desolation.  Geogre  21:24, 17 May 2007 (UTC)    I can only plead that I don't see the extreme offense in the term; I'm happy to accept suggestions for a terse edit summary to describe this kind of little add-some-links, refine-some-categories, correct-some-typos gnoming.  Choess  02:29, 18 May 2007 (UTC)    ""Copy-edit""? ""Tweaks""? ""Tweaking""? ""Minor fixes""? None of those imply that the article was unclean, dirty, messy, or poorly written before it got scrubbed down. Speaking for myself, I get such bad vibes from ""cleanup"" that I don't think I've ever used the word in an edit summary, not even when I  have  been cleaning up a mess of prose. The authors of  Wikipedia:Cleanup  also seem to receive associations of mess and bad writing from the word:  ""Welcome to the Wikipedia Cleanup section! Please report messy articles below, and explain why they need to be cleaned-up (ex.  grammar , spelling,  formatting , order, copyright issues, confusion, etc.) ""  Bishonen  |  talk  02:54, 18 May 2007 (UTC).

In the Steer article, I was pleased that I didn't have to write an article on the land of cockayne, as  Cockayne  was linked. Well, click on it. Ok, so perhaps I needed instead to be more formal and make it  Land of Cockayne . Well, click on  that.  Sigh. I should have known.

Bishonen  |  talk  23:23, 17 May 2007 (UTC).     What's more, complaining here gets results. There is now a nice dab at Cockayne, and I did an egged Cockaigne|Cockayne in the article anyway. My usual spelling is ""Cockaigne"" (because I learned about it in my eME class, when I had to translate ""The Land of Cockaigne""), but I was quoting, there. Furthermore, Cloud Cuckooland is now properly redirected. When I was in the lieberry doing research for these articles, I tried to make sure that we didn't already have them before I went to the bother, so I was a bit mortified to find out that I was duplicating, but people aren't always very good about setting up redirects.  Geogre  01:49, 18 May 2007 (UTC)    That's a coincidence, I've spent the last day just over the border from Cockaigne in  Topsy-Turvy World  where they have similarly tasty roofing but a disdain for the toilet.  Yomangani talk  13:36, 18 May 2007 (UTC)    Well, be careful that you don't wander into  Acrostic land , because the people there are just plain  weird.  They have their heads in their stomachs.

Geogre  15:28, 18 May 2007 (UTC)               [ edit ]   Merge   I went to merge the Stewart articles, but how do you merge two pages that starkly contradict each other (see the final paragraph of each) and where only one (yours, Geogre) has any source? The bit about America and the  Seven Years War  sounds seductively circumstantial... but it could be credulously taken from one of the two novels involved. I couldn't find any Reliable Source about Stewart doing anything after the murder, though I guess that may say more about me than Google. I'm no judge of websites. Anyway, I lost momentum.  Bishonen  |  talk  23:18, 17 May 2007 (UTC).     I believe the  DNB  author that the mentions of Stewart after the murder are  all  fiction. What's more, he was a romantic figure, and we both know how romantic figures travel the world twice round while inhabiting an unmarked grave in Flanders. Stewart was a minor man, and the legend grew after he was safely away, so he had no reason or ability to pop up somewhere to say, ""Here I am!"" I absolutely don't believe that that particular man, with his very common name, came to America, given his circumstances (under a death warrant in the UK would tend to make one shy of contact with the English).  Geogre  01:33, 18 May 2007 (UTC)     Thanks, Bishonen. The merge looks good to me, and you saw what I was talking about: people wanting to write a life to suit a novel.  Geogre  11:52, 19 May 2007 (UTC)     [ edit ]   WP:EL   The External links policy page seems to have been taken over by people who are making changes without discussing them first, and then reverting claiming consensus and need to discuss if the new sections want to be changed.

Hello,  Landmark Education  could use a hand.   Two editors are insisting that material be included, which has been repeatedly discussed and rejected by multiple editors.   The two editors are failing (or refusing) to address the challenges and concerns posed in discussion and are simply tag-team reverting their preferred version.   I have requested page protection and I am currently at 3RR, so I cannot edit there any longer.   This has been an on going long term slow edit war for some time.   Now, rather than address the concerns, one of the editors is trying to tie my original username (that had admin in it) into the discussion.   Is it appropriate to slur in a reference to my original one-post username? She isn't even referring to the correct username and has decided that since all the history has been deleted (for a username that never existed) that something untoward is going on.   [ diff 1 ]   [ and 4x here ]   I think this is counterproductive and needs to stop. These two editors are refusing to address the concerns and are stopping to trying to discredit by implication.   We could use some help there.   Thanks again.  Lsi john  16:29, 19 May 2007 (UTC)     Have I got a  sec ? I'm reading the talkpage, I'll get back to you around... hmm... / me scrolls down to check on size ... oh, around Christmas. Unless you have a suggestion for where I can find an up-to-date informative summary and overview somewhere round there? Regards,  Bishonen  |  talk  16:43, 19 May 2007 (UTC).           HAHAHAHAHAHA Exactly! *section header here changed*               The overwhelming concensus is that the material in question is inappropriate in its current form to be included in the article. If you jump down to the LANDMARK section of the discussion, and then scroll down near the first section break, you will see the arguments a bit more formalized.               Jeff. and Ester. are refusing (or failing) to address the specific concerns and are simply saying.. its sourced so it can be included. They are not addressing the question of 'relevance?' 'significance?' .. NPOV bias by mis-representing the citations by cherry-picking comments... etc. They simply revert their old 'preferred' (by them) version.  Lsi john  16:47, 19 May 2007 (UTC)               I assume that MedCab is the next step. In the mean time Ive asked for Page Protection and I'm asking you if ER could be formally cautioned against the direction of slurring that she is headed. I'm not going to cry NPA, but her writing is clearly counter productive and not related to the article discussion.  Lsi john  16:49, 19 May 2007 (UTC)    Formally, no. I'm going to assume good faith, however little others have been doing so.  Bishonen  |  talk  17:21, 19 May 2007 (UTC).    Ok. Thank you. I would like to assume good faith as well. It's difficult when the editor inserted (and struck out) the same incorrect username in 4 different places during the same edit before clicking Submit, and worded it as an accident. To me, at the least, it was a counter productive edit.                               I brought it to you for an impartial look. I haven't been here long enough to know what is ignored under AGF and what is something that rises to the level of being 'advised against'.                               As for the page itself, I have asked for PageProtection, while the discussion and probably MedCab are utilized. My concern is that the two editors are reverting their old preferred version over top of other editors who are making edits, and thus many of those internediate edits are being lost.                               Thanks again.  Lsi john  18:41, 19 May 2007 (UTC)                                   I don't know if you noticed that I wrote to the userinformallyalways the best way to start, I think, even though on this occasion it went over like a  lead balloon . I have now added a formal warning.   John, I must caution you about using 3RR as an entitlement to revert  three  times a day, and only being concerned to avoid reverting the dreaded four times. I've seen you imply before that it's all right to revert three times, and now you're doing it again. [91]  It isn't all right. It's  Edit warring , which is considered harmful. Take a look:  The [3RR] rule does not convey an entitlement to revert three times each day, nor does it endorse reverting as an editing technique; rather, the rule is an "" electric fence "". [ 1 ]  Editors may still be  blocked  even if they have not made more than three edits in any given 24 hour period , if their behavior is clearly disruptive....The bottom line: use common sense, and do not participate in edit wars... If an action really needs reverting that much, somebody else will probably do it.  ( WP:3RR )  Bishonen  |  talk  19:24, 19 May 2007 (UTC).    I had not seen your post, but I have now. Thank you for taking time to look into the situation.   I'm aware that 3RR does not give cart blanche to revert right up to 3RR and stop and it was not my intention to imply that. In this case, I'd request that you notice that  in combination  I also requested page protection. That is not justification, as there is none for edit warring, it was simply my rationale at the time.   As you can see from the article talk page, this situation has been going on for quite some time, in a slow motion edit war that has not been making any constructive progress. And as a bedtime read, you can form you own opinion about the efforts being made on the article talk page.   Hopefully , now that the page is protected, everyone will be willing to come to the table to compromise, rather than brute force the material IN -or- OUT. I have said this on the article talk page, and I have specifically (on their user pages and in the article talk page) invited both J and ER to participate. It is clear that they have a very strong opinion that the material should be included. I'm trusting that they will be flexible on how it is worded and that everyone can agree upon a compromise.                                               Best Regards.   Peace.  Lsi john  01:52, 20 May 2007 (UTC)                         Looks like MedCab it is.  Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal/Cases/2007-05-21 Landmark Education   Lsi john  14:37, 21 May 2007 (UTC)     Perhaps that was unavoidable, but sometimes I wonder what it is we do here, spending more and more time on arguing and less and less on creating content. Anyway, John, you realize the mediator will have the posts of  many  editors to read, hint, hint? Long posts are not your friends, or theirs.

[ edit ]   Second opinion   Bish, I would much appreciate it, if you have the time, to take a look on  Talk:Atheism  and tell me if I am being unclear, or somehow conveying the wrong impression, or something. Sections  #criticism section  and  #Deleted content from talk page . The references to Vandalism are due to the Undo of Harlequinn (Harley)'s edit  here , and my informing him on the Atheism talk page and his talk page that article talk pages are archived, not deleted. I'd go into more detail, but I'd really prefer you take a look yourself - if you don't have time and would prefer I put together a synopsis, I will do so. Checking his edit summaries will probably go a long way to explaining the situation. Thanks very much -  KillerChihuahua ?!?  19:37, 19 May 2007 (UTC)     Hiya, Yappy. I've been staring at it in growing despair. The bricolage of misundertaken policy fragments is defeating me, I don't know where to start and I don't know which bits are relevant to your question. Look at this red herring in the #criticism section, for instance. Harley writes: ""The Wikipedia:Criticism guideline supports the changes I think should be made. Quotes: ...""No article should feature criticism about its topic, as those criticisms are always more appropriate at another location. For example, criticisms of Christianity do not belong in the article on Christianity, but in the articles of Christian-critical groups and concepts.""       So I thinks, how very strange, does a guideline (actually an essay, but whatever) really say that, considering it contradicts all policy and all common sense? So I go look it up in the Criticism essay, and, naaah. That quote turns out to be (while correctly quoted) a complete misunderstanding. The essay gives is as one of several  examples of an extreme and untenable opinion.  Did I mention Harley plucks it out and says it supports him...? I presume in good faith, but what a mess, what a mangrove swamp, what a rhetorician's hell, stuck trying to explain what's wrong with  that . And is it even relevant, should I take it between my teeth and run with it, straight up the vertical wall of the  Reichstag , or is it one of many, many wrong sticks?       In other words, hell yes, put together a synopsis, give me a  compass  or better still a  GPS  unit, for I'm lost. I'm drowning.  Bishonen  |  talk  12:00, 20 May 2007 (UTC).           Oh darn... Me too. I really should not be so hasty to offer a (unwritten) synopsis, I confess I was counting on your amazing ability to make sense out of mayhem. I will attempt to collate a synopsis and shall return forthwith. (That's a pun - will return forth,  with  the synopisis; if no one else posts in this section before I get back, it will be the fourth post.)

Well, as you have posted, it is now fifthwith, which if not so punny is more poetic, in a doggeral sort of way (being a dog, I appreciate that.) I will attempt to summarize rather than compile a synopsis. Summary of situation: Harlequinn, a new user, shows remarkable knowledge of obscure wiki-rules, yet utterly lacks comprehensive understanding of same. While merrily citing left and right, he also attacks all and sundry. In short, it is unclear to me whether he is a thoroughly uncivil individual who lacks basic manners, yet is editing in good faith, or is a common garden variety troll, perhaps with previous experience here under another handle. I lack the wit to discern which it is.  KillerChihuahua ?!?  13:24, 20 May 2007 (UTC)                                   You have mail.  Bishonen  |  talk  15:16, 20 May 2007 (UTC).

Bishonen  |  talk  10:33, 21 May 2007 (UTC).           [ edit ]   Wikistalking editor again   User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea  is full on his old tricks of blind reverting all sorts of changes I made to pages to try to get at me, edit warring, personal attacks and etc. See Dilbert edit  here  (where he leaves a deceptive edit comment about an infobox and goes back and restores a number of links I had removed almost a month ago); Werewolf fiction  here  (where he lies and calls my adding a spam template and him removing it as ""rvv""); Dragon, again,  here , where he couldn't get consensus to restore the links he wanted before so he now removed virtually all rest as ""spam,"" which most certainly was not at all what anyone said on the talk page about THESE links (his links, yes, but these are freaking NEWS articles); Lycanthropy  here  (and others, most of these have multiple reverts) where he just blind reverted again and giving no justification). This guy is chronically lying about what his edits are to trick anyone who isn't paying attention into thinking he's doing something normal when he's just undoing what I did.  DreamGuy  07:44, 21 May 2007 (UTC)     I'm going to look right now. But I'm always reluctant to invoke the ""stalking"" bugbearI don't really believe there is such a thing as stalking, unless the edits are pure ""nuisance edits"". If they are, I'll intervene, you may be sure.  Bishonen  |  talk  17:42, 21 May 2007 (UTC).    I'm not stalking you, I'm only following your every move, only to make edits to the contrary of you!

El_C  17:53, 21 May 2007 (UTC)                   [ edit ]   WP:SHUN  modified to allow for bullying   Thank you for reverting the nonsense added to the shunning guideline which called for ""difficult editors"" to be asked questions which would cause them to ""reveal"" their ""motives"" and be used as a ""behavior modification technique"". Unfortunately, the same editor modified  WP:SHUN   again  so that ""pertinent"" questions could be asked as a way to ""induce"" editors to ""reveal their aims"". Hence, bullying and aggressive questioning of  motives  is an acceptable tactic to use against an editor who wishes to practice shunning as an alternative to feeding the troll.

No, I got my stub  from  the  DNB,  so it's no better nor worse. Giano: the reason I wrote about her is that she wrote a book of prayers, and I was conscious of the fact that, in my hopscotching through the cemetery of the DNB I had not found very many women to write about. I wanted to find a woman to write about, and I couldn't find a female rebel, so I settled for a woman who doesn't appear to have had a happy marriage.  Geogre  20:46, 21 May 2007 (UTC)   Also, WikiAlf, thank you for the offer. The way I get my ""made to order"" articles is by sitting down with the print  DNB  and looking for fitting folks. I then take notes, rearrange to get out of their format (ick!), try to concentrate on contextualizing, if I can, and then write. Giano, she's at Frances Neville. The other one is a  redirect.  After all, I need to have  something  link to the article, as I fear not much would, otherwise. The featured player in all of this, for my money, is Mr. Prance. He's got the name and the misery.  Geogre  20:48, 21 May 2007 (UTC)    I'm lucky enough to have access to the online DNB, so it was an easy offer. I noticed the red link go blue and checked it out - hence my last post about neverminding it.

Also note that the 3RR isn't an entitlement: in fact, if people perform four reverts in just  over  24 hours, they're quite likely to be blocked for ""gaming the policy.""

I don't have a problem with Mikkalai. But I note that that RFC should have stayed in the creator's userspace until it was ready for mainspace, which it doesn't look to be. Nobody's tried to resolve the conflict, for instance, and menwhile the 48 hours are ticking. I won't meddle for my part, I've had enough of trying to get editors to follow the RFC instructions. It's a thankless task. Also I don't exactly blame people for getting it wrong, it's a bureaucratic nightmare.  Bishonen  |  talk  18:51, 22 May 2007 (UTC).    D'you know I've just suddenly realised something - (ALoan will understand this) for years I've been thinking RFC stood for Rugby Football Club, and wondering why so many odd Wikipedians were interested in Rugby (even though I had never heard of some of these clubs - the world is a big place) and for years thinking because they were interested in Rugby I would give them the benefit of the doubt, assuming anyone who likes rugby can't be all bad etc. Now I realise they were all quite probably odd after all.

Content that violates this policy may be reverted at any time, and is not subject to the 3 revert rule. How many reversions have I made within the last 24 hours that fail explictly to note that I am reverting because of a WP:BLP violation? It is only these that count.   justice-thunders-condemnation  19:11, 22 May 2007 (UTC)     I was rather expecting that argument. [94]  It's breathtakingly specious. No, you don't fail to  note  that you're reverting BLP violations, indeed; it's just that the things you revert signally fail to  be  BLP violations. They count all right.  Bishonen  |  talk  19:21, 22 May 2007 (UTC).           Dear Bishonen,               Unfortunately, you have made charges here--that my argument is ""breathtakingly specious"" and that the things I have reverted ""signally fail"" to be WP:BLP violations--without providing any argument or evidence in support of them. Why then should I accept your charges?               I will be quite happy to discuss this matter with you on rational grounds (but not by trading unsubstantiated charges back and forth; that is not  civil  behavior). If you can convince me that employment of the N-word equivalent N___ O___ M___, in the manner in which Watchdog07 employs it, is  not  a WP:BLP violation, I will be willing to refrain from reverting it on that ground.               What are your arguments and/or evidence that this is not a WP:BLP violation, my friend?               justice-thunders-condemnation  19:58, 22 May 2007 (UTC)                   You're asking me to prove a rather random negative. Your contention that everything you don't like is a BLP vio is too absurd to address. It's like arguing with the  Red Queen  or something. I have already referred you to the policy itself WP:BLP and to the  WP:LAWYER  page. Please review them. Meanwhile, as long as you're willing to refrain from violating 3RR, I'm willing to refrain from blocking you. That's my best offer.  Bishonen  |  talk  20:33, 22 May 2007 (UTC).

While I disagreed (and still to a point, disagree) with your viewpoint regarding that issue, I regret the manner and the tone in which I said them. When I said ""No biggie"" with Giano, I was saying if he didn't consider it anything to worry about, neither did I. Since you still have ill feelings about what I said, it is a biggie and I apologize, wholeheartedly and completely. (I tried to approach Bishzilla with a cookie to try to apologize a few weeks back, but the mighty Zilla wasn't hungry.. which in retrospect is a good thing, because I hear being digested is a horrible way to go (Grins)). Have a great day.  SirFozzie  20:26, 23 May 2007 (UTC)     Thanks. What can I tell you, I have less and less power over the monster. She's too busy eating editors to care much for cookies, I think.

Calton, my point is that after the blinding discourtesy you last doled out to mea user who'd made a point of being nice and helpful to you I'd just rather dispense with your presence on my page.

Geogre  04:09, 26 May 2007 (UTC)    Nobody clicked and saw how William Wall's template runs on twice as long as his article and that his template is, essentially, its own little article about how to be a Baptist?

It was a checklist of crucial doctrines for Baptists. That seemed to be a sort of polemic, or a guide. It's odd information for a template. Then, of course, it was also double the vertical length of the article, but we're all used to that by now.  Geogre  02:28, 28 May 2007 (UTC)           [ edit ]   Nooo!

DIFF  - This is most highly inappropriate behaviour by  Lsi john  ( talk Â     contribs Â     pageÂ moves Â     blockÂ user Â     blockÂ log Â   Â  rfcu ). I made one mistake with regards to  one  citation amongst the hundreds I have added to articles. This amounts to  WP:STALK , as well as  WP:NPA . I have come to you for help, as opposed to WP:ANI, per your prior suggestion to all of us. Thank you for your time. Yours,  Smee  23:41, 26 May 2007 (UTC).     Thank you for your response. However your comments served only to point the user in a direction for more appropriate actions, which is good, but did not serve to warn the user about his inapproprate behaviour, which is difficult to deal with at times, to say the least.  Smee  00:14, 27 May 2007 (UTC).               Thanks for taking it here. I'm no fan of invoking WP:STALK, except in cases where somebody follows another editor around in order to make nuisance edits to everything they do. That's hardly the case here. But I agree that the talkpage of  Pathwork  was an irrelevant place for Lsi John to bring up the PSI thing (in extenuation, the matter seems to have got to him in a big way). As you've already seen I've written to him there, and, in fact, to you too. No, I don't agree that it's in my brief to talk to him as if to a child, I think my note was, by implication, quite sufficiently reproachful. I'm not in the business of smacking editors.  Bishonen  |  talk  00:22, 27 May 2007 (UTC).    Okay, your points are valid, sounds good. Thank you for dealing wth this all in such a polite manner. And glad to know I did the right thing by coming to you first. Yours,  Smee  00:25, 27 May 2007 (UTC).               DIFF  - He keeps bringing up an honest mistake that I made with (1) citation that I apologized for, and I have added hundreds of helpful reputable sourced citations to this project in a good faith effort to expand and increase the quality of other articles on the project. His continued harassment of me with this issue is inappropriate and rude. Can you do something about this? I am reaching out to you instead of reporting this, as you have asked us all to do. Thank you again so much for your time, and polite language and patience in this matter. Yours,  Smee  12:20, 28 May 2007 (UTC).    DIFF 2 , This is getting silly and ridiculous. Again, I have added lots and lots of information from reputable cited sources to the project, and helped to expand quality articles. This behaviour by this user is inappropriate. Thanks for your time.  Smee  12:49, 28 May 2007 (UTC).               Smee, in the Pathwork article, I felt the details were important as they were directly related to a very similar situation in the past. You had asked that the article not be deleted and ultimately promised to bring it back with sufficient reliable sourcing. You were making the same claims for Pathworks that you had for PSI World.       In the LGAT template discussion I did not bring up any specifics. You stated that I had failed to provide 'reliable sourcing' for my views in a discussion (which doesn't require reliable sources). You brought up 'citable sources' in an inappropriate context and I merely suggested that someone else might want to handle that discussion with me. You then chose to include specifics. I did not feel that specifics were important. However, once you brought them up, and misrepresented the situation, it was important to correct it, for the record. Running to Bishonen every time and crying stalking, is a bit silly, IMO.               You inappropriately roast companies with your sourced 'allegations', 'speculation', and 'innuendo', and you base entire articles around these 'dismissed' lawsuits and 'suspicions'. You publish POV in the name of 'reputable sourcing', yet you don't make any effort to provide the other POV and thus to obtain NPOV articles.               I find it perplexing that you have no problem applying tar and feathers to companies, yet you cry harassment when anything is mentioned at all which remotely referrs to the  facts  of your prior inappropriate misconduct.               This is clearly a sensitive issue for you and I will make every attempt to avoid the subject whenever possible and not bring it up unless it is appropriate to do so.  Lsi john  12:55, 28 May 2007 (UTC)                       I have removed the LGAT template from my watchlist and am no longer editing or contributing to it. I have also removed almost every other LGAT article from my watch list. It is not a productive use of my time to attempt to edit articles when  Smee  continues to complain and then distract the discussion and make it about  Smee  and how  Smee  is being mistreated.       In the mediation for  Landmark Education   here ,  Smee's  first 9 posts were all  off-topic  and about NPA and Smee  refused   diff  to post within a designated user comment-area (as other editors were doing).  Smee's   10th post  clearly stated that Smee was no longer involved in the article. And,  Smee  has now 'joined' the mediation but has yet to provide one single comment which addresses the article or the items being debated.                               Someone commented on the 3O discussion page that perhaps Smee needs to take a 2-3 month break from 3O  diff . I suggest that Smee might consider taking that suggestion on a broader scale. When every single comment (by one editor) in a mediation is related to NPA or is talking about other editors' actions, it suggests to me that the editor may be burned out and need a break.  Lsi john  13:21, 28 May 2007 (UTC)                                   John? You realize I get the New Messages banner every time you post HINT HINT?

My apologies for posting to you again,  Bishonen Â ( talk Â     contribs ), but this last comment by  User:Lsi john , editing within another user's comments, and then ending the discussion, is more along the same theme of inappropriate talk page behaviour. Thank you again for your time.  Smee  17:44, 28 May 2007 (UTC).    Well, unless there's something behind it that I'm not aware of, I agree that those {{fact}} templates in your text were pretty unconstructive. But note that he says he's taking it off his watchlist, so... Try to relax, look away, go Zen, Smee. It's something that's worth doing on Wikipedia for your own benefit, rather than for the other person.  Bishonen  |  talk  18:09, 28 May 2007 (UTC).    Sounds like very good advice. Thank you.  Smee  19:57, 28 May 2007 (UTC).               Question     Bishonen , as  Smee  has been coming to you repeatedly, I'd like to ask for clarification on the 3RR rule. You warned us both about 3RR and Smee continues to push it. In the  Large Group Awareness Training  article Smee was edit warring with Justanother, Jossi and myself. There were 6 clear reverts and I reported the incident on AN3RR. Before the case could be decided, Smee went to 7RR. Thats specifically 4RR against me and at least 3RR with other editors.   The other admin seems to be under the impression that this is the same article that Smee keeps edit warring in and has protected the article. When I questioned him, he and Smee seemed to exchange pleasantries.   I'm not asking you to overrule anyone, but could you explain whats going on and why Smee gets 7RR and I have to stop editing because I'm 2RR?  Lsi john  05:58, 30 May 2007 (UTC)     Please read the actual faulty 3RR report, as well as the comments at it from  User:Anynobody , and the explanations of  User:Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington  there and at his talk page.  Smee  06:00, 30 May 2007 (UTC).           The other day Smee was 3RR/2RR in two articles, and after being found no-vio, he went to 4RR/3RR within an hour and again the ruling was no-vio (due to self-revert).   Now its 7RR and still no violation? This is certainly peculiar at best.   If I'm going to be editing with someone who gets 7RR, I'd like permission to at least go to 5RR myself. Thanks. Lsi john  06:03, 30 May 2007 (UTC)    The user's interpretations of 3RR, as well as my own actions, are incorrect, and this was shown by comments from other editors/Admins.  Smee  06:05, 30 May 2007 (UTC).               [ edit ]   Sumple   Sumple had some personal attacks against me on his userpage.

Ferrylodge  02:24, 28 May 2007 (UTC)     You're most welcome, I'm glad to have been spreading sunshine.  Bishonen  |  talk  02:28, 28 May 2007 (UTC).           Now that I am unblocked and have taken some additional time beyond that 24-hour block period to consider this matter, I would like to follow a dispute resolution process. Wikipedia guidelines  say : ""When you are unblocked, you may then follow the dispute resolution process if you believe that you were treated unfairly.""               One dispute resolution option is a ""third opinion"", but that does not seem appropriate here,  because  ""The third-opinion process requires good faith on both sides of the dispute."" My good faith in this matter has been reapetedly disputed, so I assume that a ""third opinion"" would not be appropriate here. Indeed, I was blocked by you immediately after saying, ""I am glad to be done posting on this page,"" so it is clear that you dispute my good faith, and this is also evident from your remarks such as ""leave KC the hell alone."" Thus, a ""third opinion"" would not work here.               Another option, before I resort to arbitration, is  mediation . However, mediation ""cannot take place if all parties are not willing to take part."" Therefore, I will assume you are not willing to take part, unless you provide some indication to the contrary. Ferrylodge  17:23, 29 May 2007 (UTC)                   That's right, I'm not willing to take part in mediation with you. You don't want advice from me, I'm sure, but you can have it anyway: a  request for arbitration  isn't going to be accepted at this point. See how it  says  """"last resort""? Instead, the normal and accepted next step for you would be to file a  request for comment , mentioned  here . You can file an RFC about misuse of administrative tools (=my block button). Mind you, I think you'd be disappointed with the result, but don't take my word for it, ask someone else.  Bishonen  |  talk  18:40, 29 May 2007 (UTC).                           Where should I place the request for comment? Ferrylodge  18:53, 29 May 2007 (UTC)   P.S. The guidelines  say  ""at least two editors must have contacted the user on their talk page...."" I am only one user. Therefore an RfC does not seem to be possible. Any advice on that? Ferrylodge  18:59, 29 May 2007 (UTC)                 Before filing an RFC, you may like to test the waters at little further at  WP:ANI . The reaction that you get there may give you some indication of the way things will go at  WP:RFC  or  WP:RFARB . --  ALoan   (Talk)  19:11, 29 May 2007 (UTC)     Thanks for the info. I may try  WP:ANI . However, I would still like to know whether I must pursue an RfC in order to subsequently pursue an RFARB. An RfC seems to require more than one complaining party, whereas there is only one complaining party here. Ferrylodge  19:25, 29 May 2007 (UTC)           Would you please advise me on that, Bishonen? Ferrylodge  19:31, 29 May 2007 (UTC)         Look... the double role you're asking me to play here is a little weird. You could do with an experienced user to help you with the process, but it shouldn't be me. I was going to suggest the  WP:AMA  page, but I see it's inactive. OK, I suggest that you either ask Sandstein, since you've met him, or add the {{helpme}} template to your talkpage, and somebody will show up to advise you. And no, you don't need two people complaining, you just need a second person to  endorse  your complaint. You know, to agree that it has merit, and also to contact me and try to resolve the issue. (Perhaps you, ALoan?) Also, there's no formal requirement to do an RFC before an RFAR, you can go right ahead and request arbitration, if you like. It's certainly a simpler process than RFC.  Bishonen  |  talk  19:48, 29 May 2007 (UTC).     Endorse? Me? I was trying to suggest very gently that an RFC or RFARB would be wasting everyone's time (as, I believe, posting to ANI would demonstrate in short order). Go away and sin no more, y'know? Ho hum. --  ALoan   (Talk)  20:02, 29 May 2007 (UTC)           Thanks for the advice, Bishonen. Earlier today, you stated: ""You don't want advice from me."" Then when I ask your advice you say that it's ""weird."" I will ask for no more advice from you.               ALoan, your invitation to visit ANI so that I can be told to ""go away"" is an invitation that I will decline. Ferrylodge  20:06, 29 May 2007 (UTC)    I had to read this three times, but I  think   Ferrylodge  is asking for help with dispute resolution regarding the 'other' party, not with  Bishonen . I  think  he was asking  Bishonen  to 'take part' in overseeing the mediation, not participating. Its muddy, but after I read it from that perspective, it seems that might be the case anyway. Then again, I've been wrong before.  Lsi john  20:59, 29 May 2007 (UTC)    And you're wrong now. I  am  the other party. And also being asked to help.  Bishonen  |  talk  21:16, 29 May 2007 (UTC).    Then I go back to my initial reaction. I agree with  you , it is just weird (and a bit extreme). At least it made some sense, if he was asking you to help mediate. It would be interesting to watch him edit in the LGAT or Scientology articles (or not).  Lsi john  21:57, 29 May 2007 (UTC)                                           Yes, it is weird at Wikipedia to try and establish some minimal level of rapport, and to try and show some minimal level of respect. My apologies. Ferrylodge  22:03, 29 May 2007 (UTC)                         (undent) I will pursue this matter as far as it can be pursued. After that pursuit has failed (and I have little doubt that ALoan is correct in saying that it will fail), then I may leave Wikipedia and I may not. But let me be clear about one thing: I do not take being called a liar lightly, and that is exactly what you have done, Bishonen. I was blocked by you immediately after saying, ""I am glad to be done posting on this page,"" and you not only blocked me but warned me to ""leave KC the hell alone."" I am an honest man, and am not a liar.   For you to also accuse me of ""harassment"" at a Wikipedia page, and to insist that I not be able to leave the barest denial at that same Wikipedia page, is also contemptible. I do not know whether your ""harassment"" accusation will enter into my soon-to-be ill-fated arbitration request, but your ""harassment"" accusation was as ill-founded as your accusation of dishonesty. The facts are clear: Killerchihuahua explicitly said that the question of whether RCOG is a ""pro-choice group"" is a separate issue from whether RCOG has a ""pro-choice position"" on a particular issue. Subsequently, I made one single edit saying RCOG had a pro-choice position on a particular issue. Before I knew it, she was using that one single edit to accuse me of edit-warring and disruption and bad faith. And then you pounce.   Go ahead and delete this comment if you wish, but make no mistake. You have made a serious and extremely insulting accusation, and I intend to pursue this until the end, regardless of the outcome. Ferrylodge  21:07, 29 May 2007 (UTC)     Lsi john suggests (at my talk page) that I explain to you precisely what I want, in hopes of avoiding unnecesary hoops. I have never planned to try to get your admin powers revoked, and have never demanded an apology from you. What I am looking for is an acknowledgment (e.g. from you or from an arbitration committee) that I was not harassing KC, and that I was not lying when I said at KC's talk page that I was ""done posting on this page,"" and that I am an honest Wikipedian. I will, of course, assume that you decline to acknowledge any of those things, unless you indicate otherwise. Ferrylodge  03:24, 30 May 2007 (UTC)    Ferrylodge ,        I did NOT suggest you ask (yet). I suggested you read, and wait and cool off.   You probably should NOT assume things, and certainly not tell someone you assume they will disagree with you or that you assume they will or will not do something. Its bad form and tends to put people on edge.           Lsi john  03:42, 30 May 2007 (UTC)                   Lsi john, you said: ""Cool off a bit. really, take a breath and relax. If you went into a court hearing the way you went to Bishonen's talk page, the judge would throw you out. Go read what you've written to Bishonen. Don't write anything else right now, just go read it. Put yourself in her place. Do you really ask her for anything? Perhaps I missed it. But to me, it looked like you went right for the throat and never even told her what you wanted to end up with."" Maybe I did not follow or describe your suggestions as precisely as possible. I am not perfect, and I do appreciate your help here.                       By the way, I never go into court. I just get the patents for the clients, and what they do with them is their business. Very often, I tell the clients that I will do thus-and-such unless I hear from them to the contrary. It's just a habit. It enables me to move along without waiting an eternity. I'm glad that you didn't have any substantive objection to anything but the last sentence of my previous comment. Ferrylodge  03:58, 30 May 2007 (UTC)             Lsi John, thank you for attempting to resolve this. I sincerely appreciate your kind intentions. If you plan to continue your dialogue with Ferrylodge, please do it somewhere other than on this page, as it seems to have reached the  point of diminishing returns  here. Ferrylodge, thank you for clarifying your wishes. I do in fact decline to make the acknowledgements you suggest. Please pursue your assumptions and intentions somewhere else, I'd rather not have any further repetitions of them on this page. Thank you.  Bishonen  |  talk  05:24, 30 May 2007 (UTC).     Thanks for the answer. Ferrylodge  05:47, 30 May 2007 (UTC)       P.S. I have been instructed to let you know about  this incident report  at ANI. I hope you will let KC know about it if you think she should. Ferrylodge  12:08, 30 May 2007 (UTC)       [ edit ]   A nervous hello......   hi bish - as a user in good standing who has had some contact with me, i wonder if you'd mind having a look at the discussion on the talk page of the no personal attacks page - i'm feeling pretty bullied, and would value your advice (there, here, on my talk page, or anywhere!)   .....equally - the whole thing is a bit unhappy, so if you prefer to keep your wiki sky cloud free for the sake of sanity / serenity i'll understand if you don't want to engage.....   best wishes to you anyway, and take care! -  Purples  04:18, 28 May 2007 (UTC)   I think it might have all calmed down a little now, maybe i was overly sensitive to come to you - anyways, have a wonderful day....  Purples  04:48, 28 May 2007 (UTC)     Purples, it's not the serenity (what? where?), it's that I should have already been asleep for some hours, I'm in a different timezone. Can't look at anything now. Tomorrow.  Bishonen  |  talk  05:01, 28 May 2007 (UTC).      OK, I'm awake.., but I've been putting off reading all that stuff, sorry. It's the kind of subject I don't willingly get involved inI just feel I have enough quarrels on my plate without that. But since you come to my page, I'll try to give you an answer, and sorry about the belatedness. I have to disagree with your removal of that section. That's because I think removing those famous links  is  current policy. I don't mean it's necessarily the consensus on the NPA talkpage that the section should be on the NPA page (I can't face reading through that talkpage), but that it's policy. Policy isn't words on a policy page, it's current practice, in particular admin practice. Those words on a page come after policy has already been established. And, yes, it is my impression, per ANI, that removing those links is what we currently do. While quarrelling about it, admittedly, and while linking a lot to that famous arbcom decision, which isn't really an appropriate authority (arbcom doesn't determine policy). But nevertheless that it's on the whole what we do. I'm sorry you're feeling bullied.   Reading... oh. I do see why you're feeling disparaged. Though I know exactly where SlimVirgin is coming from,, too. Darn. Seriously... I'm very sorry I've been so slow. I'm going to post a couple of sentences now.  Bishonen  |  talk  00:16, 29 May 2007 (UTC).   Thanks so much for your kind words... i think it really helped to avoid my editing situation derailing (or derailing further!) - you're very kind to help out, and it's appreciated - have a great day...  Purples  04:09, 29 May 2007 (UTC)     No problem, it's simply my opinion.  Bishonen  |  talk  04:11, 29 May 2007 (UTC).

It is a sort of attempt at the  eiron  as  fool , and it is up to everyone else to laugh at this  Andy Kaufman -styled bit of humor.  Utgard Loki  17:30, 29 May 2007 (UTC)        Utgard, (I do love a man with a strong name) your wit is so intellectual sometimes I feel we are meant for each other. As I sit here having my coronet and shoes polished it fatigues me reading the Encyclopedia. I do so wonder though what on earth is happening. Naturally, as one would expect, I am besieged with people (mostly that  Jimbo person ) wanting me to record my memories, and of course I am still working on my own biography but what sort of people will read them? I will certainly not allowed them to be serialised by a Sunday Newspaper (I knew  John Profumo  and saw his winkle in his eye as he espied me in the Royal Enclosure, as as for the fun we had at  Cliveden ) - such happy and fulfilling days. My problem is if one is to write about one's nearest and most very dearest one does not want the riveting details read by the lower classes (all this anyone can edit business is very worying indeed) - does Wikipedia have some screening process to stop this affront. Of course I need a confidential copy-edit. There are so few editors here, from what I like to think of as ""the right sort of people"" (I would ask that nice little  Mrs. Bishonen , (but between ourselves I suspect she is not 100% British) perhaps I'll ask that sweet  General Bonkers  (he has such an elegant turn of phrase  [108] ) or even  Mr. Counter-Revulsion , although (he intimates he is a lawyer - very nasty almost trade!) or perhaps poor  Sir William  although he has enough troubles of his own having been so rudely redirected by that nasty  Glaswegian doctor  - I don't trust Doctors myself always wanting me to take my clothes off, I expect if he saw me that would be the first thing he would want - I've met his type before! So who does one ask - good editors are so few on the ground that clever  Mr. Mackensen  is so busy running the place, someone suggested an American personage called  Brad  but what sort of a name is ""Brad"" <shudder> for a gentleman? and all those ""medals"", which he likes to expose upfront, so very vulgar!  Ms. Martin  (she says she is inactive, poor old thing, some mornings I know how she feels) and  Mr. Sidebottom  (""Tone"" as he like me to call him in moments of intimacy) again an obvious choice but always so busy - I suppose I have no choice - it has to be that frightfully grand  Sicilian person  but at my age my knees find curtsying such a problem - Oh do someone help me out.  Lord Wetman  keeps himself very above this kind of thing, I wonder what happened to that nice very English  Member of the Peerage  always such a true gentleman, if he only knew of my distress - Oh the British if only one could rely on them to come to the rescue - a damsel could be saved.  Catherine de Bourgh (Lady)  19:24, 29 May 2007 (UTC)                                           <bows deeply>I am much obliged, my lady; but unfortunately I am peer less . --  ALoan   (Talk)  21:52, 30 May 2007 (UTC)                                               Wow, what a bitch!

Yomangani talk  22:03, 30 May 2007 (UTC)                                               What's more, one wonders about the sort of argument that  would  stand at a university! I read recently of a large bequest grandfather made being used to endow a chair for some woman writing about ""Lesbian self-discovery in the body of Jane Austen."" Jane Austen's body surely never suffered such an affront before, and I can think of nothing she did to ever earn it. If  that  is the sort of thing that he wishes, then we shall have no more to do with it! --  Viscount Thomas Buckingham, Mrs.             Excuse me ladies! I cannot believe Doc Glasgow would wish to undress Lady Catherine, and when addressing me there is no need to curtsey, a small genuflection is sufficient. Regarding Ms Austen: While, I believe though she did rather portray Lady Catherine as a nasty old trout - I doubt she knew what a lesbian was.

The answer to your second question is no, to both. --  JHunterJ  18:52, 2 June 2007 (UTC)           That's not an edit war. She went back to the status quo. Based on your own opinion alone, you demanded a change. That makes you the one who is ""edit warring."" Furthermore, you offered no rationale for the change before making it and still haven't -- even after making incendiary charges. Wanting and needing are very different things.  Geogre  20:55, 2 June 2007 (UTC)    I cannot war by myself, and I made no edits to the page after the first Talk page message (which was on my Talk page). I also haven't ""demanded"" any changes.

Lsi john  05:11, 4 June 2007 (UTC)     If you have a moment, you may wish to read through some of the talk page discussion. I am going to take a new tack, or at least try my best to, and try to simply ignore impolite language on talk pages that is not related directly to discussing article content.  Smee  05:22, 4 June 2007 (UTC).    I did. Smee, I'm sorry, but I tend to agree with Lsi John that your focus on ""politeness"" is becoming quite unconstructive, and tends to be itself impolite. It seems to be more and more your main subject, and even to be preventing you from discussing content, which is what talkpages are for. And, I know this may be me, but frequently I don't even understand why you call something impolite, or call it politewhen somebody writes a comment to you, I just can't predict whether you're going to respond by thanking them for their politeness, or by complaining of the opposite. If people you're in conflict with experience the same uncertainty as me, it obviously militates against communication between you. Perhaps you might like to consider whether your interpretation of the civility/incivility of other people's words is rather idiosyncratic? At any rate, please focus on content on talkpages. People aren't usually out to insult you, as far as I can see. And a comment like  this  isn't a ""new tack"" in this respect saying  that you'll ignore somethingand saying only thatis the opposite of  really  ignoring it.  Bishonen  |  talk  16:19, 4 June 2007 (UTC).    Bishonen, I am sorry that you feel that way. However, It is reassuring to know that you think certain individuals are not out to insult me. And your advice about  how  to do the actual ignoring is also useful, and I will try to apply this in certain situations if things get heated. Thanks for your time, and your candor. Yours,  Smee  20:05, 5 June 2007 (UTC).    Again, thanks for the feedback, if you have any other comments on this, just message me on my talk please.

[ edit ]   Request for action regarding Ferrylodge account   Dear Bishonen:   I am writing because I have two requests regarding your recent interaction with Ferrylodges account [109] .   First Request: I have read at the text preceding your block, and I do not see how Ferrylodge [110]  had done anything even approaching harassment. The harassment warning of 02:16, 28 May 2007 comes like a bolt out of the blue. I request that you supplement Ferrylodges block log to acknowledge that the harassment warning of 02:16, 28 May 2007 was not warranted by the text. I ask that you consider this request regardless of what you think of my second request.   Second Request: As it stands, your entry in Ferrylodges block log  [111] is misleading. According to Wikipedia guidelines, ""very brief blocks may be used in order to record, for example, an apology or acknowledgment of mistake in the block log in the event of a wrongful or accidental block"" [112] . Please supplement Ferrylodges block log in order to acknowledge that the block was deemed appropriate (by Sandstein) [113]  for the purpose of disengagement, and not because Ferrylodge's final message, before the block, amounted to harassment.   Regards,  LCP  16:29, 4 June 2007 (UTC)     LCP , you might consider reading this sequence and reconsidering your request. I took an interest in this situation after Ferrylodge tried to shift the focus of his block in a conversation with me, which started here on Bishonen's page and continued on his talkpage  here , moved to Bishonen's page  here  and finally ended back on Ferrylodge's page  here .     00:23 May 28, Rude post by Ferrylodge on KC's page, declaring that KC does not have an ounce of objectivity.  here       01:10 May 28, Rude post by Ferrylodge on KC's page, classifying Killerchihuahua's editing as conspicious (def: marked by a noticable violation of good taste).  here       01:46 May 28, Rude post saying dealing with Killerchihuahua's editing is a waste of time and categorizing Killerchihuahua's editing as disruptive.  here       Note: all of the prior conversations belonged in the article talkpage, not on KC's talkpage.       02:16 May 28, Bishonen warns Ferrylodge (on Killerchihuahua's talkpage) not to post there again, and clearly indicates a block will follow if the warning is ignored.  here       02:21 May 28, Bishonen also warns Ferrylodge on his talkpage:  here       02:24 May 28, Ferrylodge responds to Bishonen with impolite sarcasm on Bishonen's page.  here       02:25 May 28, Ferrylodge makes same reply on his talkpage.  here       02:32 May 28, Ferrylodge ignores Bishonen's warning, and posts on KillerChihuahua's page:  here       02:36 May 28, Ferrylodge 'updates' his edit.  here       03:08 May 28, KillerChihuahua deletes Ferrylodge's post.  here       04:08, May 28, Ferrylodge  again  posts on Killerchihuahua's page.  here       04:13, May 28, Bishonen blocks Ferrylodge after he posted  two  three times, following the warning to stop. It appears the block-comment is correct.  blocklog       04:23, May 28, Ferrylodge deletes Bishonen's warning from his talkpage:  here     To my knowledge, Bishonen has never addressed the specific content of any of Ferrylodge's posts. The block was done, after a warning had been ignored  twice  three times. The block text states the reason  Repeated harassment posting on User talk:KillerChihuahua after warning , and does not cite the specifics of Ferrylodge's final post. It was the fact  that  he posted, not  what  he posted, that resulted in the violation. While Sandstein does address the specifics of the final post, it was Ferrylodge who introduced that content as related to the block. Bishonen did not. There is no reason to include Sandstein's reply to Ferrylodge's introduction of his interpretation of the block.   The fact is, he ignored Bishonen's direct warning  twice  thrice, and continued posting to KC's page. The contents of his posts are totally irrelevant, as he was very clearly told to  stop .  Lsi john  17:32, 4 June 2007 (UTC)             Thanks, John, useful list! I may well copy it for the RFC that I assume LCP's post is in preparation for. (See  WP:RFC : ""at least two editors must have contacted the user on their talk page, or the talk pages involved in the dispute, and tried but failed to resolve the problem. Any RfC not accompanied by evidence showing that two users tried and failed to resolve the same dispute may be deleted after 48 hours."") You forgot one edit by Ferrylodge to KC's page, though; the one at 2:36,  here . It's an interesting one: there, Ferrylodge  links  his innocent-looking previouos edit to a nasty set of attacks against KC that he has just made at  my  page. So it was three times, not twice, that he ignored my direct warning and posted on KC's page. Only after the third time did I block him.                           Thank you LCP. John, the fact is that I was told to ""stop"" doing something which I had not been doing. But that does not seem to matter to you. Of all the items on your very long list, only the first three items occurred before the unjustified harassment warning and block threat. Do you really want to argue that it's ""harassment"" for me to say that a person lacks objectivity? Or for me to say that a person has conspicuously omitted diffs to support their position? Or for me to reply to accusations of disruption, bad faith and edit-warring by asserting that the accuser is herself being disruptive? None of those things that occurred at KC's talk page is remotely like ""harassment."" And not even Sandstein believed that my later denial of the harassment charge itself amounted to harassment. Ferrylodge  18:14, 4 June 2007 (UTC)    No, sir. You were told to stop  posting , which you  had  been doing. Your posting was regarded as harassing, but you were not told to stop harassing, you were told to stop posting. You said you were happy to be done, but you didn't stop. You were clearly told that 'any' further post would be regarded as harassment. You ignored that, three times. The block was justified. You really need to move on and drop this issue. (I won't post further here, as the facts speak for themselves.)  Lsi john  18:23, 4 June 2007 (UTC)                                           You may regard  this denial  as harassment, but that does not make it so, by a long shot. Ferrylodge  18:40, 4 June 2007 (UTC)   P.S. I must bow out now, due to employment. Ferrylodge  18:42, 4 June 2007 (UTC)                               Dear LCP. Ferrylodge was harassing KillerChihuahua on her page, and I warned him against posting there again. He replied with a sarcastic thank-you on my page, full of attacks against KC, and expressing pleasure in being spared, through my warning, ""the agony"" of dealing with her anymore. [114]  (For all the world as if somebody had been physically forcing him to post on her page, and my warning had somehow released him.) I replied lightly. [115]  There was apparently something unsatisfactory about that, because he then posted on her page, to say that there also that he was ""done"". [116]  It seemed a bit repetitious, but I ignored it. Then he posted on KC's page  again , this time  linking  his previous innocent-looking message to the attack on her that he had just made on my page. [117]  Call me soft, but I ignored that as well. I hoped he was running down. He wasn't. A little later, he posted on KC's page again, for the  third  time since my warning, repeating yet again that he was done, and introducing (rather belatedly, you may say) what has since become his main theme, a protest against my use of the term ""harassment."" [118]  Three postshe wasn't running down. I blocked. And now you want me to put a note in the block log to say that was an inappropriate block? Seriously? That block wasn't for Ferrylodge's final message. It was for the cumulative effect of his messages on KC's page, and most especially for posting to it  three times  after my warning. I notice Ferrylodge is complaining richly and variously about not being allowed to rebut my charge of harassment in the place where I made it, when the truth is that I turned a blind eye to his first  two  posts there (as well as to the vicious business of his post on my page), and only blocked on the third. I'll deal with your  ruleslawyering  about Sandstein agreeing with Ferrylodge in the  request for comment  that I presume you're working up to. Go ask Sandstein to put a note in the block log, why don't you. And about that RFC: I'm not the person to advise either of you, but I wish Ferrylodge would consult with  some  experienced users about frivolous RFCs and the way they have of turning into commentary on the behavior of the nominator instead. You'd think the feedback he got on  WP:ANI  would be a bit of a hint.  Bishonen  |  talk  18:05, 4 June 2007 (UTC).                   Bishonen, you start your comment by saying: ""Ferrylodge was harassing KillerChihuahua on her page...."" I agree with you that that assertion is central to justifying your actions. Do you really believe that the first three items on Lsi john's long list amounted to ""harassment""? Why then do you suppose KC never asked me to leave? Ferrylodge  18:17, 4 June 2007 (UTC)    I won't speculate on her motives, and I'd appreciate it if you and LCP didn't post on my page anymore, unless there's an actual need. It seems to me that posting 15 full screens about the matter on ANI and being amply answered by many admins ought to be enough. If this is about racking up the requisite dispute resolution attempts in preparation for an RFC, I hereby waive all further requirement for those. That should be a relief to all three of us.

I noticed he left the project; however, an anonymous IP (clearly Sumple based on contributions) removed my comment in  Talk:Culture of Taiwan   [119] . This seems to be a deliberate baiting attempt (using his IP as a way to avoid scrutiny) since obviously I'm on revert parole after the arbCom case. Moreover, this [120]  seems to directly targets my userpage. Can you restore my comments and maybe block the IP as sockpuppet (does it apply)?? Thank you! -- Certified.Gangsta  08:32, 5 June 2007 (UTC)     I was just going to revert the IP, after writing a comment on their talk, when I saw you'd done it yourself.

Deckill er  20:06, 5 June 2007 (UTC)     Just so you know, even though I followed your bit about ""elitist,"" I wasn't going after you. I was trying to point out only that some of us don't think it's our business to go through passing judgment on everything. It's true that my judgment on a great deal of content would be something you'd find offensive, for example, and yet you and I have never been at odds and will not be, because you're not going to go around to an article I've written and complain that the sentences are too long, and I'm not going to go to an FAC review of a pop culture article and try to kill it because it's not on a topic I like. The people causing the problems on these FA and GA pages seem to me to want to be in power, in control, and the center of every single potential article. They don't do this with content, but only with footnotes and irrational (often flatly wrong) proclamations about ""grammar."" A person's academic elitism or street cred seem to rarely cause problems, but intolerance and attempts at being a big cheese always seem to be the kiss of death for something.  Geogre  20:41, 5 June 2007 (UTC)    I know. Whenever I review FACs, it's for people who I know or articles that haven't received enough feedback. I used to be part of that entire FAC/FAR team, but I went back to primarily editing becuase of all the arguments and everything else associated with it. I'm somewhat of a wordnerd, but I'm not at Tony's level yet, so I usually try to be humble in my prose opposes. Speaking of pop culture, I get a ton of flak from merges and transwikis, and I'm not even really ""anti-fiction""! There's so many levels of opinions on Wikipedia, and the best we can do is find a compromise and/or work on our favorite areas. By the way, sorry if I don't sound very coherent; it's been a long day, partially because of the flak I mentioned above.   Deckill er  04:04, 6 June 2007 (UTC)       It's all back down to ""Whom does the Grail serve?"" If we're trying to serve the public through Wikipedia, that's fine. If we're trying to serve the abstraction known as Wikipedia, that's a little worrying. If we're out to serve ourselves, it's bad, bad. Folks need to get therapists, or dogs, or something, and leave off trying to be Very Important through Wikipedia. When the power goes out, Wikipedia goes away, and it would be a pity of one's self image and importance were so tenuous. Trying to be the gargoyle before the doors of the Featured Star just rubs me very much the wrong way.

He was correct. I hope that you will accept my apology for that. I also seem to be guilty of lacking a correct understanding of the significance of an RfC. From what I read on the RfC page, I gathered that it was merely an objective review of facts. So, I also seem to be guilty of not investigating matters deeply enough before I became involved. I am sorry for that too. You warning to FL does, nevertheless, appear to be heavy-handed. However, regardless of what I think of that, I did jump to a conclusion. And for that, I also apologize.

But the whole system whereby any editor can so easily enforce a review on FAR at any timehowever inconvenient for the authorand for any reasonfor instance, that they don't notice the cite system usedthat gets to me, and I think it will in the long run have to be changed. It's hard to believe that writers will keep putting their best work on FAC when there's such high-handedness down the road, on FAR. Doesn't make any difference to me, though, as I'd already foresworn the FAC process. It was extravagantly unpleasant the last time I put an article through it.

But it seems that Smee is intent on disrupting the talk pages in numerous articles.   Smee is posting links to old versions, implying that they are correct and accurate, and noting how interesting it is that sources have been removed, implying bad faith removal by other editors, and noting how interesting it will be to come back later to see how much the article has changed.   This seems to be in very Bad-Faith and I have asked [User:Smee|Smee] to stop. As the messages indicated that Smee would no longer be watching the articles, I posted the request on Smee's talkpage in order to be sure it was seen. (added: And it was immediately removed).   I attempted to remove the disruptive comments and Smee has reverted them. As I have promised not to go to AN/I with this, I am coming to you instead.   Thank you.  Lsi john  21:49, 6 June 2007 (UTC)     [ edit ]   Removing my comments from multiple article talkpages?     I am truly sorry to bother you again.  Lsi john Â ( talk Â     contribs ) is removing my comments from  multiple  article talk pages, and calling them ""Bad Faith"". I am simply noting the state of the article as citations are being removed from that article, so that other editors can come back and easily see this. However, that is besides the point. It is extremely rude and weird for another editor to remove  someone else's  comments from an article talk page, unless those comments post that editor's personal off-Wiki contact information, or is a blatant personal attack, as far as I understood policy. But to remove another editor's comments just because that user  feels  it is ""bad faith"", seems to be a bit bad faith itself. I do not know what to do in this situation.  Smee  21:46, 6 June 2007 (UTC).    Again, to make it simple: I do not see how posting a comment with a link to an older page, and noting the number of citations the article had at that time, and then saying I am taking a break from that article, is in any way ""disruptive"", ""own"", or ""bad faith"", or anything of the sort. It is simply that - stating how many citations the article had at the time, nothing more, nothing less. But I would appreciate your input.  Smee  21:49, 6 June 2007 (UTC).    You know what? Nevermind. Actually, if  User:Lsi john  really wants to be this disruptive, and remove my comments from talkpages, call them ""bad faith"", and edit war over comments on an article's  talk page , that's fine. I am just going to remove them from my watchlist. It will be interesting to hear your feedback in any event. Again, I  am  sorry for bothering you. Yours,  Smee  21:57, 6 June 2007 (UTC).    By the way, just to be clear, I Self-Reverted on each of the three articles' talkpages in question, back to the version where  User:Lsi john  removed my comments from the article talkpages, just so it is clear there is no confusion.

Smee  22:46, 2 June 2007 (UTC).       It should also be noted, that there are really no other 'active' editors for Smee to say Goodbye to on those articles.   These appear to be disruptive, bad-faith, presumptuous and condescending.   If these look like Good-Faith and polite commentary from Smee, then I will apologize.  Lsi john  22:00, 6 June 2007 (UTC)   It appears that Smee considers numbers and source-counting more important than relevance, accuracy and quality of the articles.  Lsi john  22:04, 6 June 2007 (UTC)     Possibly. But that's just something that makes you angry, it's not being ""disruptive"". Disruptive is a very strong word, it refers to actions that badly disturb the functioning of the project. See  Wikipedia:Disruption : "" Just because you don't like something doesn't mean it is disruption. Disruption is a large-scale hindrance of Wikipedia's ability to function, whether technically, administratively, or socially. "" Surely those talkpage posts don't do that? Don't remove comments on talkpages, please, John. It takes very, very good reasons for that to be considered OK. Please instead just note your opinion of the posts, on the same pages.  Bishonen  |  talk  23:01, 6 June 2007 (UTC).           When Smee posted the first one a few days ago, I questioned it, but left it. Today, when three more appeared, I found it highly offensive that Smee would presume to assume and suggest that relevant citations had been (and would continue be) inappropriately removed and that the articles would  digress . Taken in  total , I felt the comments were rude, disruptive, presumptuous (and a few others).   I accept your opinion that they were not disruptive. I have reverted them back to the talk pages.               Smee, I apologize for characterizing your talk-page comments as disruptive. It seems I was incorrect about what is considered disruptive, for that I apologize.   Lsi john  23:35, 6 June 2007 (UTC)           Thank you,  User:Bishonen , for noting the inappropriateness of  User:Lsi john 's actions. Please note the disparaging statements made by him about me at the talk pages for articles  Lifespring ,  Mind Dynamics , and  Evaluating a Large Group Awareness Training , the exact same comment, which is unrelated to the  content  of each of those articles, but moreso just to disparage me on those article talk pages. This is highly inappropriate, but  unlike   User:Lsi john  I am  not  going to remove that inappropriate comment. I will leave that up to you or him to talk about. I am done here, and if you wish to talk with me Bishonen, just message me on my talk page. This behaviour is extremely frustrating by this user, but at this point, a break is in order for me in any regard. Message my talk if you wish. Yours,  Smee  02:10, 7 June 2007 (UTC).     The comment is very appropriate in rebuttal to your implication of my editing conduct. It is completely factual, and addresses the concerns you have raised about  vanishing  sources. If you do not want editing conduct to be discussed, then I suggest you not imply poor editing from other editors.

After all, if an automated process is capable of making the  judgment  that a photo is ""needed,"" then they surely possess the  discernment  to know if the photos are good ones. I apologize to Saint Desideratus, of course.  Geogre  00:47, 9 June 2007 (UTC)           Ok, another question. See, if you will, for a moment,  1698 in literature  and the section ""New books."" See there? I, the fearful porpentine frost giant, have editorialized. I have done so for a single year, and it's indisputaf*ckably true. Still, I remember telling Thor a true thing, too, and he still wanted to whack me with his hammer.  Utgard Loki  17:17, 8 June 2007 (UTC)       [ edit ]   Warning   The WP:FAC process is supposed to work by civil discourse, not by  threats . Don't talk like that or you may find yourself blocked.  Bishonen  |  talk  20:05, 8 June 2007 (UTC).     Warn him for being uncivil then.  Epbr123  20:09, 8 June 2007 (UTC)    I don't see him being uncivil, give me a link for it, please. Mind you, you don't get to threaten people under any circumstances. ""Remove your Oppose or..."" is no way to talk.  Bishonen  |  talk  20:13, 8 June 2007 (UTC).                   I've been uncivil in the past and received two blocks for it, so I'm aware of civility related issues - I've served my time so to speak on other issues, so I don't see why Epbr123 feels I need a warning personallu. I replied on my talk page in a rather frank manner which may be considered uncivil, but there you go - I just didn't like the ""remove your oppose or else"" type attitude, even though I was a little hasty in my reply. I've also started discussion on the FAC talk page regarding the issue, especially since she called SandyGeorgia ""a sad bastard"" for Sandy's opposes to the noms a few weeks back. Even though I'm not exactly a nice guy sometimes on Wikipedia, thanks for your time in the matter though I hope it doesn't descend into anything else further and it can be resolved in a cool manner - I just don't wish for Epbr123 to cause further trouble for me that's all as I wish to keep my head low on Wikipedia for awhile. Unfortunately, she's  removed  your warning so I can't see the issue being resolved anytime soon.  LuciferMorgan  20:24, 8 June 2007 (UTC)                           He's opposing my facs for no good reason and refusing to move them.  1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  4 ,  5 . ""Don't talk like that or you may find yourself blocked."" - isn't this a threat?  Epbr123  20:27, 8 June 2007 (UTC)                                   I see, no link to support your accusation of incivility. No, an administrative warning is not a threat, it's a chance for you to pull up and pull in your horns with no harm done. Admins are required to warn before blocking. People complain, quite reasonably, if they're blocked without having been warned first. Please avoid personal attacks, and note that uncivil edit summaries [122]  are particularly ill regarded.  Bishonen  |  talk  20:41, 8 June 2007 (UTC).    Look harder for the link then. It wasn't an incivil summary. You interfered with the argument, ignorant of the full facts. Epbr123  20:44, 8 June 2007 (UTC)    No link to  support  your  accusation.   Bishonen  |  talk  20:47, 8 June 2007 (UTC).                             By the way, top-posting is needed to indicate who you are talking too.

She was married to poet and painter  Stan Rice  for 41 years until his death in 2002. Her books have sold nearly 100 million copies, making her one of the most widely read authors in modern history. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ]           Contents       1   Early years   2   Writing career   3   Return to Catholicism   4   Leaving New Orleans   5   Amazon.com incident   6   Adaptations     6.1   Film   6.2   Television   6.3   Theatre   6.4   Fan fiction   6.5   Music inspired by Rice's novels       7   Bibliography   8   See also   9   References   10   External links               [ edit ]   Early years   Rice spent most of her early life in  New Orleans ,  Louisiana , which forms the background against which most of her stories take place. She was the second daughter in a  Catholic  Irish-American family; Rice's sister, the late  Alice Borchardt , also became a noted genre author. She has a brother named Jack.   About her unusual given name, Rice said: ""My birth name is Howard Allen because apparently my mother thought it was a good idea to name me Howard. My father's name was Howard, she wanted to name me after Howard, and she thought it was a very interesting thing to do.""   Rice became ""Anne"" on her first day of school, when a nun asked her what her name was. She told the nun ""Anne"", considering it a pretty name. Her mother, who was with her, let it go without correcting her, knowing how self-conscious her daughter was of her real name. From that day on, everyone she knew addressed her as ""Anne"". [ citation needed ]   Her first child died at the age of five from leukemia in 1972. Her second child with Stan, her late husband of 41 years, is her thirty-year-old son Christopher. Some of his work can be found in Rice's novel  The Queen of the Damned . Anne has a Master of Arts in Creative Writing from  San Francisco State University . Her first novel,  Interview With The Vampire , was published in 1976.     [ edit ]   Writing career   In 1958, when Rice was 17, her father moved the family to north  Texas , taking up residence in  Richardson . Her mother had died three years before of alcoholism. Rice met her future husband while they were both students at  Richardson High School . She began college at  Texas Woman's University  in  Denton  but relocated with Stan to  San Francisco  where Anne attended  San Francisco State University  and obtained a B.A. in Political Science. ""I'm a totally conservative person"", she later told the  New York Times  ( November 7 ,  1988 ). ""In the middle of  Haight-Ashbury  in the 1960s, I was typing away while everybody was dropping acid and smoking grass. I was known as my own square."" She would not return to New Orleans until 1989. [ 5 ]   Rice's daughter Michele was born on  September 21 ,  1966  and died of  leukemia  on  August 5 ,  1972 . Their son  Christopher Rice , now a novelist, was born March 11, 1978.   She completed her first book,  Interview with the Vampire , in  1973  and published it in  1976 . This book would be the first in Rice's popular  Vampire Chronicles  series, which includes 1985's  The Vampire Lestat  and 1988's  The Queen of the Damned . Rice has also published  erotica , adult-oriented fiction, under the  pen name   Anne Rampling , and has written explicit  sadomasochistic   erotica  as  A.N. Roquelaure .   Her fiction is often described as lush and descriptive, and her characters' sexuality is fluid, often displaying  homoerotic  feelings towards each other. Rice said that the bisexuality was what she was looking for in her characters; a love beyond gender especially with the  Vampire Chronicles  because the vampires were not of human society, therefore did not go by the expectations of that society. She also weaves philosophical and historic themes into the dense pattern of her books. To her admirers, Rice's books are among the best in modern  popular fiction , possessing those elements that create a lasting presence in the literary canon. To her critics, her novels are baroque, ""low-brow pulp"" and redundant. A critical analysis of Rice's work can be found in  S. T. Joshi 's book  The Modern Weird Tale  (2001).     [ edit ]   Return to Catholicism   In 1998, after dabbling in  Mormonism  and spending most of her adult life as a self-described  atheist , Rice returned to her  Roman Catholic  faith, which she had not practiced since she was 15. In October 2004, as she reaffirmed her Catholic faith, Rice announced in a  Newsweek  article that she would ""write only for the Lord."" She called  Christ the Lord: Out of Egypt , her first novel in this genre, the beginning of a trilogy that will chronicle the life of  Jesus .   In an interview with  Christianity Today , headlined  ""Interview with a Penitent"" , Rice declared that she will never again write another vampire novel, saying; ""I would never go back, not even if they say, 'You will be financially ruined; you've got to write another vampire book.' I would say no. I have no choice. I would be a fool for all eternity to turn my back on God like that."" Some of her fans reacted with shock to the news of her religious and literary conversion, admonishing her in magazine articles, internet weblogs and reader reviews found on the web. Rice responded in a post on  Amazon.com  (see below) that stated: ""And yes, the Chronicles are no more! Thank God!""   However in an interview with TIME Rice made a comment that she may write one more novel in the series which she confirmed on her website that she may or may not make the book, but if she did it would be a Christian novel with a redemption theme involving Lestat and the Talamasca. [ 6 ]  She later changed her mind yet again and issued a statement on her website denying she would write such a book. [ 7 ]   In October 2008, she released the autobiography  Called Out of Darkness: A Spiritual Confession , detailing her  Catholic  upbringing and her eventual return to Catholicism. In it the 67-year-old Rice describes the two decades she spent writing books on vampires, demons and witches as a prelude: ""To be able to take the tools, the apprenticeship, whatever I learned from being a vampire writer, or whatever I wasto be able to take those tools now and put them in the service of God is a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful opportunity. And I hope I can redeem myself in that way. I hope that the Lord will accept the books I am writing now."" [ 8 ]   [ 9 ] [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   Leaving New Orleans   Rice discovered she had  Type 1 diabetes  when she went into a  diabetic coma  in December 1998.   In 2002,  Stan Rice  died after a long illness. In her subsequent depression, Rice's weight rose to 254 pounds (115Â kg). In response to  sleep apnea  and other weight-related problems, Rice had  gastric bypass  surgery in 2003.   On  January 30 ,  2004 , having already put the largest of her three homes up for sale, Rice announced her plans to leave  New Orleans . She cited living alone since the death of her husband and her son's moving out of State as the reasons. ""Simplifying my life, not owning so much, that's the chief goal"", said Rice. ""I'll no longer be a citizen of New Orleans in the true sense."" Though she left New Orleans prior to the disaster of  Hurricane Katrina  in August 2005, and none of her former New Orleans properties took on water, she remained an advocate for relief for the city.   Rice may also have wished for more privacy from the constant attentions of her fans, who were known to camp out in front of her house; up to 200 or more would gather to see her leave for church on Sundays.   In spring 2005, Rice moved to  La Jolla ,  California , to be nearer her son,  Christopher . She moved less than a year later to  Rancho Mirage  for a warmer climate and a ""simpler life"".     [ edit ]   Amazon.com incident   On September 6, 2004, Rice posted a reply to a number of negative reviews that had appeared on  Amazon.com  regarding  Blood Canticle . She titled her reply, ""From the Author to the Some of the Negative Voices Here."" This post generated a great deal of publicity onlinepartly because authors rarely post or respond to reviews on Amazon, and partly because of the tone and nature of her text, which was considered by many members of the writing community to be bitter, angry and aggressive.  [ 11 ]  Many previous reviews had criticized the quality of writing in  Blood Canticle  as lazy or shoddy; when Rice replied by writing an article, the incident became fodder for  weblogs  and  Internet  sites. Following this incident, whether at the author's request or at Amazon's own volition, the comment and several others were later removed. Rice's own discussion on the incident is available on  her website .     [ edit ]   Adaptations     [ edit ]   Film   In 1994,  Neil Jordan  directed a relatively faithful  motion picture  adaptation of  Interview with the Vampire , from Rice's own screenplay. The movie starred  Tom Cruise  as  Lestat ,  Brad Pitt  as the guilt-ridden  Louis  and was a breakout role for young  Kirsten Dunst  as the deceitful child vampire  Claudia .   A second film adaptation of the  Vampire Chronicles  came out in 2002. Starring  Stuart Townsend  as the infamous Lestat and singer  Aaliyah , the movie combined incidents from the second and third books in the series but released under the title of the third book,  The Queen of the Damned . The plot was substantially altered from that of the book, and the film was poorly received by fans and critics alike.   A 1994 film titled  Exit to Eden , based loosely on the book Rice published as Anne Rampling, starred  Rosie O'Donnell  and  Dan Aykroyd . The work transformed from a love story into a police comedy, possibly due to the explicit S&M themes of the book.   A film version of  Christ the Lord: Out of Egypt  was planned but later canceled.     [ edit ]   Television   In 1997 she wrote a television pilot entitled  Rag and Bone  staring  Dean Cain  and  Robert Patrick , which featured many of the common themes of her work.   The Feast of All Saints  was made into a miniseries in 2001 by director  Peter Medak .   Plans to adapt Rice's  Lives of the Mayfair Witches  trilogy into a twelve-hour miniseries to be aired on NBC were dropped after a change of studio head and subsequent loss of interest in the project.     [ edit ]   Theatre   On  April 25 ,  2006 , the musical  Lestat , based on Rice's  Vampire Chronicles  books, opened at the  Palace Theatre  on  Broadway  after having its world premiere in  San Francisco, California  in December 2005. With music by  Elton John  and lyrics by  Bernie Taupin , it was the inaugural production of the newly established  Warner Brothers Theatre Ventures .   Despite Rice's own overwhelming approval and praise, the show received mostly poor reviews by critics and disappointing attendance.  Lestat  closed a month later on  May 28 ,  2006 , after just 33 previews and 39 regular performances.   In 1997, a ballet adaptation of Interview with the Vampire premiered in  Prague .     [ edit ]   Fan fiction   Rice has an adamant stance against  fan fiction  based on her work, releasing a  statement  on  April 7 ,  2000  that prohibited all such efforts. This caused the removal of thousands of  fanfics  from the popular  FanFiction.Net  website.     [ edit ]   Music inspired by Rice's novels   Cradle of Filth  briefly includes Lestat in the song ""Libertina Grimm"" as ""Count Lestat"".   Sting  got the inspiration for his song ""Moon over Bourbon Street"" from  Interview with the Vampire .   Guitarist extraordinaire  Steve Vai  states in liner notes for his album The Elusive Light and Sound volume 1, that his song ""Loveblood"" Was inspired by the film and the fact that he wished he was an actor so he could play the role. Alternative rock band  Concrete Blonde 's song ""Bloodletting (the Vampire Song)"", the title track from the Bloodletting CD, is based on Rice's  The Vampire Lestat.   The  Australian  pop band  Savage Garden  found their name in  The Vampire Lestat , in which Lestat describes the world as ""the savage garden"".   The  metalcore  band  Atreyu  declares in the song ""The Crimson"", ""I'm an Anne Rice novel come to life.""   Punk/goth band  The Damned  recorded a song called ""The Dog"" about the child vampire Claudia from  Interview with the Vampire  on their 1982 album  Strawberries .   The Italian band  Theatres des Vampires  is named after a location featured in several books of  The Vampire Chronicles . Their 1999 album is called  The Vampire Chronicles .   Post-hardcore  band  Aiden  wrote and recorded a song entitled ""The Last Sunrise""a lot of the lyrics of said song relate directly to the first book of  The Vampire Chronicles ,  Interview with the Vampire .   Malice Mizer , a Japanese rock band based heavily on French culture, uses the phrase ""Drink from me and live forever"" in their song ""Transylvania"". ""Drink from me and live forever"" is a phrase from the first book Interview With the Vampire.   Mexican band  Santa Sabina  dedicates a song to Rice's vampire character Louis: ""Una cancin para Louis""   Psytrance  project  Talamasca  was named after the secret society in both the Vampire chronicles and the Mayfair Witches series. This is a solo project by the French musician Cedric Dassulle, which also calls himself  DJ Lestat .   Japanese  visual kei  rock band  Versailles  first album,  Noble , is subtitled ""Vampires Chronicle"". Furthermore, the sixth song is entitled ""After  Cloudia "", insinuating a relationship with Claudia from the series.   Italian gothic rock group  Last Minute 's debut album,  Burning Theater , was conceived as an unofficial soundtrack for  Interview with the Vampire , including the title track and two others, all focusing heavily on the death of Claudia.

He was educated at a number of local  schools , and during the Chicago  influenza  epidemic in 1891 spent a half year on his brothers' ranch on the  Raft River  in  Idaho . He then attended the  Phillips Academy  in  Andover, Massachusetts  and then the  Michigan Military Academy . Graduating in 1895, and failing the entrance exam for  West Point , he ended up as an enlisted  soldier  with the  7th U.S. Cavalry  in  Fort Grant ,  Arizona Territory . After being diagnosed with a  heart  problem and thus found ineligible for a commission, he was discharged in 1897.   What followed was a string of seemingly unrelated and short stint jobs. Following a period of drifting and ranch work in  Idaho , Burroughs found work at his father's firm in 1899. He married Emma Centennia Hulbert in 1900. In 1904 he left his job and found less regular work, initially in Idaho but soon back in Chicago.   By 1911, after seven years of low wages, he was working as a  pencil sharpener  wholesaler and began to write fiction. By this time Burroughs and Emma had two children, Joan and Hulbert. During this period, he had copious spare time and he began reading many  pulp fiction magazines  and has since claimed:     ""...if people were paid for writing rot such as I read in some of those magazines that I could write stories just as rotten. As a matter of fact, although I had never written a story, I knew absolutely that I could write stories just as entertaining and probably a whole lot more so than any I chanced to read in those magazines.""     Aiming his work at these pulp fiction magazines, his first story ""Under the Moons of Mars"" was serialized in  The All-Story  magazine in 1912 [ 1 ] [ 2 ]  and earned Burroughs US$400 (roughly the equivalent of US$7600 in 2004).   Burroughs soon took up writing full-time and by the time the run of  Under the Moons of Mars  had finished he had completed two  novels , including  Tarzan of the Apes , which was published from October 1912 and went on to begin his most successful series. In 1913, Burroughs and Emma had their third and last child, John Coleman.   Burroughs also wrote popular  science fiction  and  fantasy  stories involving Earthly adventurers transported to various  planets  (notably  Barsoom , Burroughs' fictional name for  Mars , and  Amtor , his fictional name for  Venus ), lost  islands , and into the interior of the  hollow earth  in his  Pellucidar  stories, as well as  westerns  and historical romances. Along with  All-Story , many of his stories were published in the  Argosy Magazine .   Tarzan  was a cultural sensation when introduced. Burroughs was determined to capitalize on Tarzan's popularity in every way possible. He planned to exploit Tarzan through several different media including a syndicated Tarzan  comic strip ,  movies  and merchandise. Experts in the field advised against this course of action, stating that the different media would just end up competing against each other. Burroughs went ahead, however, and proved the experts wrongthe public wanted Tarzan in whatever fashion he was offered. Tarzan remains one of the most successful fictional characters to this day and is a  cultural icon .   In 1923 Burroughs set up his own company,  Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. , and began printing his own  books  through the 1930s. He divorced Emma in 1934 and married former actress  Florence Gilbert Dearholt  in 1935, ex-wife of his friend,  Ashton Dearholt , adopting the Dearholts' two children. They divorced in 1942.   At the time of the attack on  Pearl Harbor  he was a resident of Hawaii and, despite being in his late sixties, he asked for permission to be a  war correspondent . This permission was granted and so he became the oldest war correspondent for the U.S. during  World War II . After the war ended, Burroughs moved back to  Encino, California , where, after many health problems, he died of a heart attack on March 19, 1950, having written almost seventy novels.   The towns of  Tarzana, California  and  Tarzan, Texas  were named after Tarzan. In 1919 Burroughs purchased a large ranch north of  Los Angeles, California  which he named ""Tarzana."" The citizens of the community that sprang up around the ranch voted to adopt that name when their town was incorporated in 1928. And the unincorporated community of Tarzan, Texas was formally named in 1927 when the postal service accepted the name, reputedly coming from the popularity of the first (silent) ""Tarzan of the Apes"" film, starring Elmo Lincoln, and an early ""Tarzan"" comic strip.   The  Burroughs  crater on Mars is named in Burroughs' honor.

Please help  improve this section  by adding citations to  reliable sources .  Unverifiable  material may be challenged and removed.  (October 2008)       Burroughs's work has had an influence on many science fiction and fantasy writers, including  H. P. Lovecraft  ( The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath ),  Robert E. Howard  ( Almuric ),  Leigh Brackett  (especially her novels and novellas set on Mars and Venus),  Lin Carter  (a significant number of overt pastiches), and  Ray Bradbury , who have exerted a considerable influence of their own on the science fiction and fantasy genres. Brackett and Bradbury actually collaborated on the famous 1946 Burroughs-derivative novella  Lorelei of the Red Mist . In addition, fantasy writer  Michael Moorcock , who co-wrote the screenplay for the 1975 film adaptation of  The Land That Time Forgot , in 1965-66 released a trilogy of Burroughs pastiches,  Warriors of Mars ,  Blades of Mars , and  Barbarians of Mars  under the telling pseudonym ""Edward P. Bradbury"".   Certainly the most evident feature of Burroughs's novels is their frequently formulaic nature. There are plentiful mad scientists and mad queens, strong but honorable heroes, and a nearly certain guarantee that the hero of any novel will fall in love with a woman who sooner or later turns out to be a princess. Unlike a lot of recent fiction, the main characters are never equivocal about their good or bad natures. While the plot structures are therefore predictable, they are nevertheless satisfying, accounting in large measure for their continuing success. There is a  Horatio Alger -like implication that honesty, courage, and hard work will eventually succeed (e.g.,  John Carter 's frequent exclamation, ""I still live!"") and that scheming, avarice, hatred, and laziness will not. And even this formulaic nature, not original with but perfected by Burroughs, has had a host of imitators, right through to the  Star Wars  films, which include many of the famous Burroughs tropes, such as the princess in distress (Princess Leia) rescued by the hero.   Burroughs will never be lifted up as a great prose stylist; certainly the Mars of his finest successors -  C. S. Lewis  (who acknowledges in the preface to  Out of the Silent Planet  his debt to pulp science fiction writers, though he does not name Burroughs specifically),  Leigh Brackett ,  Ray Bradbury  ( The Martian Chronicles ), and  Frederick Turner  ( A Double Shadow  and  Genesis: An Epic Poem ) - are described with a poetic eloquence that he never matched even briefly. Nevertheless his descriptions of anciently abandoned cities succumbing to the deserts of dying Mars or the grandly upswinging horizon of  Pellucidar , for example, create a lasting impression and account in no small measure for his enduring popularity. And, more than lacking the scholarly rigor of contemporary authors like  Ben Bova  and  Kim Stanley Robinson , Burroughs did not hesitate to sweep scientific fact out of the way of a good story; still, his inventiveness (the atmosphere plants striving to maintain the dissipating atmosphere on Mars come to mind, or the ring of planets in the same orbital plane in  Beyond the Farthest Star ) was not lacking in intelligent creativity.   Critics have often derided Burroughs, not unfairly, as in main an author of mere hastily written escapist fantasy, and certainly the world would be little the poorer without such shabby efforts as  Synthetic Men of Mars ,  The Deputy Sheriff of Comanche County , and  The Monster Men . But some scholars, most notably Richard A. Lupoff [ 4 ] , have pointed to the stories in  Jungle Tales of Tarzan , clearly influenced by Native American traditional stories [ 5 ] , and the novels  Tarzan of the Apes  (first in the series),  The Mucker , and  The Moon Maid , among others, as evidence that Burroughs could indeed compose works of considerable quality when he took the time to do so. And his courage to write in many genres - not only science fiction and fantasy, but Westerns (especially  The War Chief  and  Apache Devil ), then-modern gritty drama reminiscent of  Frank Norris  or even  F. Scott Fitzgerald  (such as  The Efficiency Expert ,  The Girl from Farris's , and  Marcia of the Doorstep ), historical fiction ( The Outlaw of Torn  and  I am a Barbarian ), and even a stage play ( You Lucky Girl! , which finally debuted to very positive reviews in 1997  [ 6 ] ) - suggest his determination to be considered a serious author.   Burroughs often displayed a sense of social consciousness that, if unremarkable today, was in his time (and especially among the authors and genres with which he is most associated, groups that were socially conservative because their goal was to provide escapist entertainment, not to challenge the status quo) quite unusual; in this wise Burroughs deserves comparison with how  Harriet Beecher Stowe  transformed the stereotypical ""slave romance"" for white audiences into a powerful polemic against slavery or how  Charles Dickens  magnified the popular periodical-serialized novel into an urgent call for class reform. While Jews, for instance, are unfortunately sometimes portrayed in negative stereotype in the  Tarzan  novels,  The Red Hawk , the third section of  The Moon Maid , includes an elderly Jewish character who is drawn sympathetically as evidencing considerable heroism. Likewise, Blacks (again, especially in the  Tarzan  novels, but also in the  Mars  series) and Asians (particularly in the three-part  The Moon Maid ) are depicted sometimes as stereotypes and just as frequently as wise or valorous. His Native American characters, from the early Westerns to  The Red Hawk  are more universally presented as honorable and courageous, in a time when the military subjugation of Native Americans was still vivid memory; based loosely on Native Americans, the green Martians (like the black, white, red, and yellow races) have their villains and heroes, including a woman named Sola and the magnificently fierce chief Tars Tarkas. Burroughs's female characters are frequently not simply there to scream and be rescued and later espoused by the heroes (as is the case in other genre fiction of his day, a time when women's suffrage was still a hot issue), but as equal counterparts: just as strong, intelligent, courageous, and resourceful as the males. To give but one example, Tavia in  A Fighting Man of Mars  fights side by side with Tan Hadron of Hastor, the protagonist, with equal effectiveness, setting up a deliberately sharp contrast (with which Burroughs concludes the story) to the beautiful but vain and vapid Sanoma Tora with whom Hadron had thought he was in love. It seems fair to say that Burroughs, who as noted was a moral absolutist, tended to portray individuals of every race and both genders as just that - as individuals, whose words and actions were what made them good or bad, and not their sex or heritage.   While Burroughs's antipathy for organized religion recurs as a frequent motif in his writings, his attitudes toward war appears to have changed during his career. Hollow idols and conniving clergy are deliciously skewered throughout the  Mars  series (especially among the Therns, but not to overlook the hilarious ""Tur is Tur"" scene in  The Mastermind of Mars ), but these are counterbalanced by refreshing references to the courageous soul seeking strength to go on by communing with a benign creator, references that have the feel of the spirituality of the Native Americans of the Great Plains, with whom Burroughs was surely acquainted. On the other hand, while war is painted as glorious and heroic in such earlier tomes as  The Warlord of Mars ,  Beyond the Farthest Star  suggests that in his last years, as this planet was tilting toward a second world war, Burroughs was ready to decry honestly the brutality of carnage that he himself witnessed as a war correspondent. It could even be postulated that Burroughs's most prescient vision of the future was in his implicit reevaluation of the then-axiomatic assumptions in dominant American society about religion and war, in his dramatization of the idea that social institutions serve humanity ill when they are misused to bolster the greed for vicious domination of the powerless, and his insistence that the individual who holds to the essential ethic of doing good to others is never entirely powerless against such institutions.   In conclusion, therefore, Burroughs would be unfairly dismissed as merely a hack writer; he seems not only to have striven to supersede his evident limitations as an author, but also to have striven against the prejudices and presumptions of his day. While the extent of his influence in this regard can of course not be measured, it must not be overlooked.     [ edit ]   Popular culture     In the video game  Jurassic Park: Trespasser  there is a statue of E. R. Burroughs, possibly as a reference to his novel  The Land That Time Forgot .       In chapter 16 of  Stephen King 's novel  Desperation  can be found the line "" The Farting Buzzards of Desperation . Sounds like a... Edgar Rice Burroughs novel, doesn't it?"" (Such adjective-noun-noun titles are actually a rarity among Burrough's novels; the closest analogue would be  The Deputy Sheriff of Comanche County .)       In  Rainbow Mars  by  Larry Niven , several different fictional Martian races appear, including a people who are a combination of the Red Martians of Edgar Rice Burroughs and those by  Ray Bradbury , and another who are unmistakably Burroughs' big fierce Green Martians.       In the  Mars Trilogy  novels of  Kim Stanley Robinson  the original capital city on Mars is named Burroughs as a sort of tribute. It is later flooded.       Season 1, Episode 29 of Disney's  The Legend of Tarzan  animated series,  Tarzan and the Mysterious Visitor , illustrates Burroughs as a struggling writer who travels to Africa in search of inspiration for a new novel (actually, Burroughs never set foot in Africa). In the cartoon he is called ""Ed.""       The 1980 novel  The Number of the Beast , by  Robert A. Heinlein  featured characters named  Zebediah John Carter ,  Jacob Burroughs , and  Dejah Thoris Burroughs  in homage to Burroughs' Mars novels. Among other things, these and the other main characters travel to various alternate universes, including  Barsoom ,  Oz  and  Wonderland . The protagonist of Heinlein's  Glory Road  muses on  Barsoom  in one passage.       The Marvel Comics book Excalibur created by  Chris Claremont  and  Alan Davis  paid a tribute to the John Carter stories in issue #16 and 17.

G. Wells .       In  Frank Frazetta's Creatures  published by the Frazetta Comics imprint at Image Burroughs appears as a member of a group of supernatural investigators led by former US president  Theodore Roosevelt .

Cairns Northern News, Cairns Bulletin and Southern Herald circulate Cairns from Palm Cove in the north to Gordonvale in the south. The publications are distributed free mid month to residences, libraries, newsagencies, tourist destinations, businesses and outdoor venues where the community shops, meets and greets.   Cairns Newspapers carry a lively mix of local, state, national and world news, arts & entertainment , columnists, opinion, blogs, real estate, classifieds, community notice boards, sports, etc.   Cairns Northern News has been in print for over ten years, meeting the informational needs of the people who live in the Cairns northern beaches. The newspaper went through an ownership change in 2002. CCN Pty Ltd was formed, it purchased the Cairns Northern News and released Cairns Bulletin which covers the centre of Cairns and the Southern Herald covering the south of Cairns. It also created  CCNet  and  Cairns Newspapers  an electronic news site.    During the past decade the city of Cairns has enjoyed a steady population growth of 2% annually, thus the newspaper's penetration of households has increased. Cairns residents say Cairns Newspapers one their primary source for independent news and information.   Although Cairns Newspapers don't foresee the Internet replacing the newspaper, they recognise that the electronic newspaper is becoming bigger every day. Cairns Newspapers are the first newspapers in Cairns to have an electronic newspaper presence on the Internet serving as a portal to the city of Cairns.

After a loaf of bread has been baked, a person can take a few slices, remove the crust and squish the bread into a ball form. Individuals will then eat the bread in the ball form, like an apple. As it is squished together, starch in the bread is much denser and it taste much sweeter as higher concentrations, of starch, are digested in the mouth. The mouth's saliva breaks down the starch into sugars which is the cause for a more concentrated sweetness versus regular bread eating.

Such an increase leads to deteriorating quality in many water sources, that have shrunk in proportion to the water removed for use. This also results in vast areas of land, becoming subject to increased water stress and desertification, though this is arguably a result of global trends and climate change. What is evident is that water is being used in many areas faster than it can be replenished by natural means (e.g. for irrigation, sanitation, drinking). This means many ground water levels have continued to drop, aquifiers and wells are exhausted, lakes and ponds 'dry up' and streams and rivers shrink significantly in size, some to the point of non existence. Such scarcity results in a range of environmental and social concerns.

Most of the Episodes which run as part of the 26 Episode run are offically Cannon for this show but mostly have been changed to include comments on Fan Created Characters which appear in the TSW Series. The Show then comes into force as it carrys on as a 'Third Series' for the 2 Series run of Sonic the Hedgehog (13 episodes in each).   TSW first started with a few small Writen 'Fan Fic' storys which were re-writen into still small volumes. In 2004 an 4 part- half Hour Audio Drama was created and this launched TSW more then before. Since then, a Short Animated Episode Pilot 'TSWA' (The Sonic World Animated) was created as well as a Short series of Short musical Episodes showcasing different character historys. As Of late last year, a Short Series 'The Adventures of Mighty and Ray' was created to introduce classic Sonic Characters of 'Mighty' and 'Ray' into the TSW World along with a new character 'Valaria'. This characters are rumoured to re-appear in one of the current In Production Projects. At the Moment, a 10 Episode Series of TSWA is in Production as well as a Computer Game.     [ edit ]   The Creators:   TSW was created by Two people Living in Hastings, England. Manic Man and Bluedude. They were School friends and big Fans of Sonic from a young age. As they grew up, they have been able to use skills they learnt to carry on and make there 'storys' and ideas into a full series. Though Bluedude has started his Name online, Manic seams to prefer not to give out much detail on his real life name, saying that 'it doesn't matter, it's the storys that count'. Though Bluedude hasn't been seen to do much on the series, Manic has always claimed that he is a major help on the project.     [ edit ]   New Characters:   A Number of New Characters were introduce into TSW. Some are Completely new Characters, some have bases in already created Characters and some are new takes on Classic Characters.   Manic Man Hedgehog-  Although sharing the name with the Nickname of TSW Co-Creater, Manic was the first new wave of Characters for TSW. He is a Green Hedgehog which came from 'Lower Mobuis' and after a shaky start, joined the Freedom Fighters. Though Smarter then Sonic, he isn't as Smart as many and has been used as a character to help explain things to the viewers, for Scenes where Sonic isn't around. Most of his time is spent being tormented my Female 'Amical Nett', and shares a friendy enermy tie with Whirlwind Hedgehog, created by other TSW Co-created 'Bluedude'.   Amical Nett-  Amical Nett is a Young Brown Cat (Created has quoted as say she is a 'Mobuion Comman Brown') which joined the cast after being saved by Sonic The Hedgehog and Sally Acorn. She also came from Lower Mobuis and in the TSW Short 'A Manic life' it was show that she started off feeling Sorry for Manic, but this grew into a Major Crush. She Shared a Hut with Amy Rose.   Tiara Bobowski-  Although not a Completely New Character, Tiara is though as a New TSW Character. She was Oringal created for the Canceled game 'Sonic X-treme'. Only 1 Offical Image of the character was none to have been created and he design was taken from this. The Character Colours were created by Co-Created Manic Man and a few others. Later the Offical Colour design was found out in an Interview with Game Producer, but Manic has said this colour set up will never be used. Tiara is shown as being very shy after spending most of her life along with only a Computer for friendship but some of the others have been trying to 'help' her out.   Whirlwind Hedgehog-  This Character was created along time ago with Co-Creater 'Bluedude' was a kid and bought into TSW. Whirlwind is the Son of Sir Charles Hedgehog, which makes him a cosion to Sonic The Hedgehog. At a Young age he was kidnapped and returned when older. The Story meant to explain all this (Whirlwind's Story) has been in pre-production for almost 10 years, way before TSW was even created.   Valaria Renard-  Valaria is the Main 'Bad Guy' of the Mighty and Ray Mini-Series. Not too much about the character history is given in the show but she is shown to be very smart and carefully plans out her actions.     [ edit ]   Episodes:   So far, only a small amount of 'Episodes' have been done but the do showcase the growing skill of the main writer, Manic Man. These are:   Introducing the Manic Man-  Early Writen story based on early 'Pre-TSW' storys. Introduces the Characters of Manic Man, Shadow and Dark Manic and set up many later storys   Meet the Gang-  Second Writen story which was based on an early 'Pre-TSW' story. Introduces the Characters of Amy Rose, Amical Nett, The Proffessor, Tiara Bobowski and 'Cherry'.   Power of the Chaos Emeralds-  Third Writen Story, not based on Early 'Pre-TSW' story. Introduces Tikal, Knuckles, as well as a demon none also as 'Super Sonic'.   Coming out of the Shadow-  First Audio Drama, Features Bunny Rabbot, Sally Acorn, Manic Man Hedgehog, Amical Nett, Whirlwind Hedgehog, Amy Rose and the Return of Shadow Hedgehog.   Lacky-  Short Comic set duing the Events of Coming out of the Shadow.   Amy Rose's Cookbook-  Short Comic about Amy Rose Making a Cake.   TSWA Pilot [For the Love of Manic]-  TSWA Pilot Animation about Amical Nett and her love of Manic Man Hedgehog   TSW Adventures- Issue 1-  So far, the only Issued Release of a TSW Comic Series. This Issue features Part 1 of a Story telling how the freedom Fighters first met Knuckles.   ' The Adventures of Mighty and Ray'-  3 Episode Mini Series featuring Mighty and Ray as they Travel 'Other' parts of Mobuis 'fighting bad guys' (as Ray would put it).

Although it is considered part of the Nashville, Tennessee DMA, its broadcasting range is much smaller than that, reaching primarily Christian County, Trigg County, Logan County, Caldwell County, and Muhlenberg County within Kentucky and the greater Clarksville area in Tennessee. While in early years it was primarily a Hopkinsville/Ft Campbell station occasionally featuring news from the outlying counties, today WKAG has refocused on Clarksville, Tn, where the station has a greater potential for advertising revenue growth. This change is evident by their attempts to change the station's commonly used name to ""TV-3"" (3 is the channel where the station can be viewed by Clarksville cable watchers--without cable it is viewable on the 43 UHF bandwidth, hence the original name) and by splitting their newscast (""Newswatch"") into two portions--one exclusively broadcasting local Kentucky news and the other Clarksville, Tn news only. Despite this change, ""TV-43"" remains the commonly used appelation with viewers today.   A small station, WKAG has served as a jumping ground for many reporters and producers to advance their careers, although many employees do leave the business, as is typical with entry-level newsrooms. Famous former employees include Jill Baffert, wife of Kentucky Derby winning horse owner, Bob Baffert; Barry Gresham, a television production professor for Tennessee Tech University; and WBIR Knoxville, Tn anchor Beth Haynes (of the popular ""Where's Beth?"" segment).   Previously owned by the Kentucky New Era newspaper located next door, the station now belongs to Eddie Owen, long time general manager and current Newswatch anchor.

It is integrated in the system of currently 37 river cycling routes in Germany and by far the most popular route for cyclist in this country.   The Elbe Cycle Route starts in Prague on the Moldau, which joins with the Elbe river about 50 km from Prague. It then runs for about 980 km until it ends in Cuxhaven at the North Sea.   After a failry adventurous part of the Route on the Czech side of the river one reaches the famous Elb Sandstone Mountains and crosses the border to Germany. Shortly after this the Route leads through  Dresden  and later through other cities like  Meien , Lutherstadt  Wittenberg ,  Dessau ,  Magdeburg ,  Tangermnde ,  Lauenburg ,  Hamburg ,  Cuxhaven .   There are many small villages with old churches and other interesting sites along the way. A lot of restaurants and pensions offer their service to the weary after a day of cycling.   One of the main reasons however for its popularity is probably the fact that there are no significant level changes from Dresden on. It is practically downhill all the way from Dresden to Cuxhaven.   The Elbe Cycling Route is marked throughout Germany with a special sign.     Created  at  Elbe Cycle Route , thanks.

These will help consumers narrow the choices, and make a wise one.     Identify the type of fragrance. The basic types are: Floral (flowers); Fruity (fruits); Fougere (grassy, green, herbal); Oriental (incense, spices, exotics); Chypre (woods, earthy) and Oceanic (synthetics meant to evoke a particular feeling such as: ocean, sand, rain, fabric)       Dont judge a scent just by how it smells in the bottle. Perfumes have top, middle and bottom notesingredients blended together to givea first impression. It must actually be worn on the skin, to know how it will smell, hour after hour.       Resist Trends: Not all scents work equally well with an individuals body chemistry. Even if something is trendy this year, such as chocolate or green tea, it might not smell wonderful on everyone. Trends are here today and gone in an instant. Scent is an investment so choose wisely.       Fragrance The basic scent forms are: Perfume (most expensive, because it contains the largest amount of distilled essential oils and is very concentrateduse sparingly). Cologne and Eau de Toilette (often called toilet water))and solid fragrances (less expensive than perfume and less concentrated); Body Splash (even less concentrated); Bath & Body Gels, Body Lotions & Creams, Candles, Potpourri, Aroma Sticks, and Room Sprays       Fragrance is not meant to be smelled across the room, but when others are up close.       Seasons Change and so should scent. The weather, moods, and each person's overall body chemistry will affect a scent. Lighter fragrances are generally the best bet during the warmer months, heavier scents are best for the cooler ones and special occasions. Its best to have one scent for each of the four seasons: Winter, Spring, Summer & Fall.       Fragrance is an investment. Scent, like wine or anything with organic ingredients in it, can turn or fade over time. Fragrance should be stored in cool, dry places away from the sun. Some people even store their fragrances in the refrigerator when the mercury, rises.       Money Matters: In general, the more expensive fragrances include more expensive and exotic ingredients and theyre blended by skilled experts. The less expensive scents may be less complex, but that doesnt mean that all modestly priced scents are no good. Experimentation is key, as ofthen thesame notes (key ingredients) in an expensive fragrance may be repeated in another, less costly one (although it wont be quite the same, either).       Get a sample! It is best not to overwhelm, trying too many samples all at once. The best way to buy since is to get a sample to try later,and let the scent stay on your body a few hours before purchasing it. This is especially important for anyone with sensitive skin     HOW TO BUY A GIFT OF FRAGRANCE FOR SOMEONE ELSE:     Consider Personality & Lifestyle: Do they wear fragrance at all? If so, give them something in the same range or get a home scent instead. Are they casual, stay at home, or do they work in an office all day? And, give them the license to return a fragrance if they truly dislike it. Fragrance is a personal gift and you shouldnt obligate someone to wear something they dont like (or that reacts with their skin). On a budget? If money is really tight, forgo the perfume and get a candle, scented soap, or moisturizer, instead       24.193.193.235  21:12, 9 May 2006 (UTC)Alison Blackman Dunham aka.

Notice that the number of cards in a hand increases in the first seven rounds (1,2,3,4,5,6,7), stays static at 7 tricks in the Special rounds (the middle three) then decreases back to one in the last 7 rounds.  The rows in bold are the three special rounds (Solitaire, Misery, Blinds). Notice, only Blinds has a suit indicated to be trumps.   The score sheet should also have 3 columns for each player - one to record the 'bid', one to record the 'score' for each round, and one to record the running 'total'.   The Rules   The rules of the game are quite simple if you are used to normal whist.   After the cards have been dealt, the player to the left of the dealer begins by predicting how many tricks he / she thinks they will win in that round. The number of tricks available is equal to the number of cards dealt to each player. After the first player has bid, the player to their left also bids on how many tricks they think they will win, and so on, until it is the dealers turn. The dealer must not bid in such a way so that the total number of bids matches the number of tricks available. e.g. It is round 5. 5 cards have been dealt to each player Player 1 bids that they will win 2 tricks Player 2 bids that they will win 1 trick Dealer CANNOT bid to win 2. They must either bid that they will win 0, 1, 3, 4, or 5 tricks.   Play commences like in usual whist. Each round has a suit that is Trumps, which top all other suits. The trumps suit in each round is shown on the score sheet.     Playing a trick   The player to the left of the dealer chooses any card from their hand to play. The player on their left also plays a card, any card they choose, but THEY MUST FOLLOW SUIT, if they can. And so on - each player putting one card in until every player has played on card. All players must follow the suit played by the first player if they can. The player who has laid the highest card in the suit played by the first player wins the trick. In Dutch Whist, Aces are high. However, a trump can be laid if a player cannot follow suit. If one or more trumps are laid then the person who has played the highest trump wins.   E.g. 1. Hearts are trumps Player 1 lays a Jack of Spades Player 2 lays a Queen of spades Player 3 lays a 3 of Spades   Player 2 wins the trick.   E.g. 2. Hearts are trumps Player 1 lays a Ace of Spades Player 2 lays a 5 of Spades Player 3 lays a 4 of Hearts   Player 3 wins the trick.   The player who plays the highest card wins the trick. They get to lay the first card in the next trick in that round. The person to the left of the dealer in the previous round becomes the dealer in the next round.   Play continues in this fashion, until reaching the special rounds.     Scoring   At the end of the round, the number of tricks won by each player is compared to their bid. E.g. Player 1 had bid that they will win 2 tricks - and they won 3, therefore they lost their bid. Player 2 had bid that they will win 1 trick - and won 1 trick, winning their bid. Player 3 (Dealer) bid before play that they would win 3 tricks, and won 2, loosing their bid.   In this case, players 1 and 3 would score 1 point for each trick they won. Player 2 would score 1 point for the trick won, and gain 10 points for a correct bid. A player gains 10 points for a correct bid, regardless (even if the bid was nil).     There are three extra rounds in Dutch Whist compared to Oh Hell.   These are the special rounds   Solitaire In this round, each player is dealt 7 cards. No bids are made. No suit is trumps. Tricks are played for as before.  Players score 5 points for each trick won.   Misery In this round, each player is dealt 7 cards. No bids are made. No suit is trumps. Tricks are played for as before.  Players loose 5 points for each trick won.   Blinds In this round, each player is dealt 7 cards.  Before looking at their cards, players put in their bid.  Spades are trumps and Tricks are played for as before. Scores are based on the bids made 'blinds' and are awarded points as in the rest of the game (10 points for a correct bid, 1 point for each trick won).   Play continues as before, with the number of cards dealt to each player decreasing by one with each round.       Strategy   Dutch Whist played well involves a lot of strategy. The hardest part is in predicting how many tricks you will win in each round, and if loosing, what the best outcome will be with the cards in your hand. Games can be won by spoiling anothers bid.   The special rounds in the middle part of the game, add an extra element of random to normal whist, as scores can be wiped out, go into minus figures, or propel the person loosing to the top of the score board.

Both brothers were indicted for conspiracy and for ten substantive offenses. Both brothers were convicted of substantive offenses even though one of the borthers was in prison for an unrelated offense during the time the substantive offenses were committed. The Supreme Court affirmed the convictions holding that a co-conspirator can be convicted of any substnative offense committed by a co-conspirator in furtherance of the conspiracy, as long as he shares the  mens rea  for the underlying conspiracy. Thus  Pinkerton Liability  denotes the extensive liability possible from participation in a conspiracy, which is notoriously easier to prove (hearsay testimony permissible).   Many jurisdictions reject Pinkerton liability, notably the Model Penal Code, 2.06(3), which requires the prosecution to meet the stricter requirements of accomplice liability (purpose with respect to aiding in the commission of the crime) for each substantive offense, though the agreement itself may be used as evidence.

Both his father, John de Lugo, and his mother, Teresa de Quiroga, whose family name he bore for a time, as was custom for the second son, were of noble birth. Such was de Lugo's intellectual precocity that at the age of three years he could read printed or written books; at ten, he received the tonsure; at fourteen he defended a public thesis in logic, and at about the same time was appointed by Philip II to an ecclesiastical benefice which he retained until his solemn profession in 1618. Like his elder brother Francis, he was sent be his father to the University of Salamanca to study law; but Francis having entered the Society of Jesus where he became a distinguished theologian, John soon desired to imitate him and, having vainly asked his father's permission, in two letters, entered without it in 1603. After completing his studies he was appointed professor of philosophy at Medina del Campo, in 1611, and later of theology at Valladolid, where he taught for five years. His fame as a professor of theology attracted the attention of the General of the Jesuits, Mutius Vitelleschi, and de Lugo was summoned to Rome, where he arrived early in June, 1621.   The teaching of de Lugo at Rome was brilliant; his lectures even before being printed were spread by copyists in other countries. When the General of the Society ordered him to print his works, he obeyed and without help had the material for the first three volumes prepared within five years (1633, 1636, 1638). When the fourth volume, ""De justitia et jure"", was about to be published, his superiors thought it proper that he should dedicate it to Urban VIII; he had to present it himself to the pope, who was so much surprised and delighted by the theologian's learning that he frequently consulted him, and in 1643, created him a cardinal. This put an end to de Lugo's teaching; but several of his works were published after 1643. As Cardinal, he took part in the congregations of the Holy Office, of the Council, etc., and often had occasion to place his learning at the service of the Church. He died age seventy-seven, being assisted by Cardinal Sforza Pallavicini, one of his most devoted disciples, also a Jesuit. According to his wish, he was buried near the tomb of St. Ignatius that ""his heart might rest where his treasure was"", as is said in his epitaph. De Lugo was a man not only of great learning, but also of great virtue; obedience alone induced him to publish his works, and he always retained the simplicity and humility which had led him to refuse, but for the pope's order, the cardinalitial dignity; the fine carriage sent by Cardinal Barberini to bring him as a cardinal to the pope's palace, he called his hearse. His generosity to the poor was very great, and although his income was small, he daily distributed among them bread, money, and even remedies, such as quinquina, then newly discovered, which the people at Rome used for a time to call Lugo's powder.   The works of John de Lugo, some of which have never been printed, cover nearly the whole field of moral and dogmatic theology. The first volume, ""De Incarnatione Domini"" (Lyons, 1633), of which the short preface is well worth reading to get an idea of de Lugo's method, came out in 1633. It was followed by ""De sacramentis in genere;"" ""De Venerabili Eucharisti Sacramento et de sacrosancto Miss sacrificio"" (Lyons, 1636); ""De Virtute et Sacramento poenitenti, de Suffragiis et Indulgentiis"" (Lyons, 1638); and ""De justitia et jure"" (Lyon, 1642), the work on which de Lugo's fame especially rests. In composition of this important treatise, he was greatly aided by his knowledge of law acquired in his younger days at Salamanca, and it was this work which he dedicated and presented to the pope in person and which may be said to have gained for him a cardinal's hat. De Lugo wrote to other works: ""De virtuto fidei divin"" (Lyon, 1646), and ""Responsorum morialum libri sex"" (Lyon, 1651), published by his former pupil and friend, Cardinal Sforza Pallavicini. In these six books de Lugo gives, after thorough discussion, the solution of many difficult cases in moral theology; this work has a very high value both from a theoretical and practical standpoint, as in the main it consists of questions proposed to him for solutions over long years. The seventh volume, ""De Deo, de Angelis, de Actibus humanis et de Gratia"" (Cologne, 1716), was published over fifty years after the author's death; the idea, as we find it expressed on the title page, was to complete his printed course of lectures. Other works on theology and especially on philosophy: ""De Anima"", ""Philosophia"", ""Logica"", ""De Trinitate"", ""De Visione Dei"", etc. are still preserved in manuscripts in the libraries of Madrid, Salamanca, Karlsruhe, Mechlin, etc.   Among the unprinted works, the analysis of Arnauld's book, ""De frequenti Communione"" and the ""Memorie del conclave d'Innocenzo X: Riposta al discorso . . . che le corone hanno jus d'eschiudere li cardinali del Pontificato"" may be of special interest; they are the only controversial works of Lugo. What he intended in his writings was not to give a long treatise, exhaustive from every point of view; he wished only ""to open up a small river, to the ocean"", without relating what others had said before him and without giving a series of opinions of previous writers or furnishing authors or quotations in number; he aimed at adding what he had found from his own reflection and deep meditation on each subject. Other important features of his theological conceptions are the union he always maintains between moral and dogmatic theology, the latter being the support of the former, and the same treatment being applied to both, discussing thoroughly the principle on which the main points of the doctrine rest. From this point of view the last lines of his preface ""De justitia et jure"", are instructive.   All his writings, whether on dogmatic or moral theology, exhibit two main qualities: A penetrating, critical mind, sometimes indulging a little too much in subtleties, and a sound judgment. He may be ranked among the best representatives of the theological revival of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The small river which he wished to open, is indeed among the most important which empties into the ocean of theology, so that in many dogmatic or moral questions, the opinion of de Lugo is of preponderating value. In several problems he formed a system of his own, as for instance about faith, the Eucharist, the hypostatic union, etc., and owing to the thorough discussion of the question at issue, his opinion is always to be taken into account. In moral theology he put an end, as Ballerini remarks, to several disputed questions. St. Alphonsus de Ligouri does not hesitate to rank him immediately after St. Thomas Aquinas, ""post S. Thomam facile princeps"", and Benedict XIV calls him ""a light of the Church"". Two complete editions of Lugo's work were published at Venice in 1718 and 1751, each edition containing seven volumes. Another edition (Paris, 1768) was never completed. The last edition is that of Fournials (1868-69), in seven volumes, of which an eighth volume with the ""Responsa moralia"" and the ""Indices"" was added in 1891.

The Dulcimer First came too use in the early 12 century in the southern part of Germany, where it was used for cutting fabric and leather.   Latter the knife became a favorite of the nobility and they often used it as a show piece on there belts. Some of the Dulcimers were made with rich ivory for a Beautiful handle piece but the average one used wood as the handle to make it affordable and usable by the peasantry and the crafters.   The origin of the Dulcimer is shadowy and uncertain most modern historians believe it to have been created by the early Stone masons to cut straps and fabric. The exact craft of manufacturing it was for many years a closely guarded secret among the group known as the stone masons. Sources List Facts and Origins of the Masons by Daniel J.

Hardy- Biographical Memoirs V. 46 (1975). Cyril Norman Hugh Long, the elder son of John Edward and Rose Fanny (Langdill) Long, was bron on June 19, 1901 in a village in Wilshire, England. However, most of his youth was spent near Manchester, in the town of Wigan. He often talked about his childhood as something especially important to the rest of his life. He had shown great academic promise as a boy, but never pursued the life of a scholar or of a scientist. Instead, he entered government service, becoming a Tax Surveyor. He was known for his rigid honesty and disposition, at home he dedicated his time to literature and history, and he devoted a lot of his energy in a number of hobbies. He experimented in the making of perfumes, jams, and woodwork. He also collected rare books and personally knew some authors such as Joseph Conrad. His father encouraged always encouraged him to be a serious student and to become a scientist. As a scientist his central theme research was the endocrine control of metabolism, which is far more complex than appeared possible a few years ago. He, with the help of a medical student, B. Katzin, was able to describe quantitatively the biological properties of the adrenal cortical hormones; he published a paper on the subject in Endocrinology in 1940. In addition to extensive correspondence, there are numerous laboratory notes, lecture notes, drafts of published papers, reports. He headed the Yale University Department of Physiology and School of Medicine for thirty-three years. Mr. Long died in 1970.

The 1860-style matches also reflect the language, customs, sportsmanship, good manners, and gentlemanly behavior associated with that bygone time.   The Muffins were established in 1981 at Ohio Village, a recreation of a typical Civil War-era Ohio community on the grounds of the Ohio Historical Center at I-71 and 17th Avenue. From April through November each season, the Muffins play an ambitious schedule of approximately fifty games. Home games are held on Muffin Meadow at Ohio Village. Away games take the Muffins to various communities throughout Ohio playing matches with other vintage clubs and with local community teams at various events such as bicentennials, heritage days celebrations, festivals, and fairs. In recent seasons the Muffins have traveled east to New York, west to Colorado, north to Minnesota, and south to Virginia while providing an educational and entertaining experience for participants and spectators.   The vintage base ball program at the Ohio Historical Society includes the Ohio Village Diamonds, a successful womens team which plays base ball according to the rules and customs of 1860. The Diamonds also play an energetic schedule of home and road games.   Each Labor Day weekend, the Muffins and Diamonds host the Ohio Cup Vintage Base Ball Festival, a gathering of 20-25 vintage teams in period uniforms from all over Ohio and several other states. The assembled teams play matches on three fields from morning to evening on Saturday and Sunday. The Ohio Cup Festival is a colorful, family-friendly, and educational event featuring exhibits and refreshments. The event is the oldest and largest gathering of vintage base ball teams in the nation and is a highlight of the vintage base ball season.   Along with the vintage base ball program at Old Bethpage on Long Island, which also began in 1981, the Muffins are the co-originators of the sport of vintage base ball and have been instrumental in helping with the establishment of many other vintage teams. Today there are approximately 200 teams in the United States and Canada playing vintage base ball. Information about the Muffins and Diamonds vintage base ball program at the Ohio Historical Society is available at www.ohiovillagemuffins.org.

The Capitals play an active schedule of approximately 15-20 matches a season. Their uniformsdark blue trousers and hats, blue and white checked shirts with white shieldswere designed from newspaper accounts of those worn by the original 1866 Columbus team.   The Capital Club often holds its matches at the playing field at the Ohio Village on the grounds of the Ohio Historical Society at 17th Avenue and I-71 on the north side of Columbus, near the Ohio State Fair Grounds. The Capitals also play on other local venues, often partnering with the Ohio Village Muffins to present an entertaining and educational demonstration of how the national pastime was played in the 1860s. One such joint effort is an annual game at Schiller Park in the German Village area of Columbus which re-creates an actual match of July 11, 1867 held on those very grounds (known as City Park at that time) between the Columbus Capitals and the visiting Washington Nationals. In this historic re-creation game, the Capitals portray their forbearers of the same name, and the Muffins portray the visiting Nationals, one of the top clubs of the 1860s and the first eastern club to make a tour of western cities. Columbus was the first stop on the Nationals historic tour in the summer of 1967 when base ball was spreading into the Midwest and becoming known as the national game.   The Capitals-Nationals match is notable in that three members of the Hall of Fame were on the field on the occasion of the original 1867 game. George Wright, the greatest player of his era, was in the line-up for the Nationals. Harry Wright, Georges brother and the Captain of the Cincinnati Red Stockings, came up from the Queen City to umpire the game and escort the Nationals to the next stop on their tour. Henry Chadwick, the great 19th century sportswriter, rules expert, and originator of the box score, accompanied the Nationals as their official scorer and wrote articles about the tour for the eastern newspapers.   In addition to its matches in Columbus, the Capital Base Ball Club also embarks on road trips several times a year to play other vintage throughout Ohio and other states. Recent out-of-state trips have included games at The Museum of the Civil War Soldier (Pamplin Park) in Petersburg, Virginia, the World Series of Base Ball at Greenfield Village at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan, the annual National Road Festival in Addison, Pennsylvania, the Field of Dreams film location in Dyersville, Iowa and the Silver Ball Tournament in Rochester, Minnesota. The Capitals are also regular participants in the Ohio Cup Vintage Base Ball Festival hosted every year by the Ohio Historical Society over the Labor Day weekend.   The Columbus Capital Base Ball Club was founded in the off-season of 1997-98 by a group of members of the Ohio Village Muffins. At that time, the Ohio Historical Society was considering changing the time period of Ohio Village from 1860 to the turn of the century. In order to preserve the opportunity to continue playing vintage base ball by the rues and practices of the 1860s, the Capital Club was formed. Research was conducted on early Columbus-area teams and the Capital Club was selected as the model for the new vintage club. When OHS abandoned plans to change the time period of Ohio Village, the Capital Club was maintained since the research done on the founding of the original club showed a heritage worthy of preservation. Members of historic Columbus Capital Base Ball Club also continue to participate in vintage base ball as players, scorekeepers, umpire and interpreters for the Ohio Village Muffins. The Capital Club is a member of the Vintage Base Ball Association and takes great satisfaction and enjoyment from re-creating base ball as it was played in Columbus during the games formative years.

He had recently undergone extensive cosmetic surgery and had no memory of his past. Dr. Marlena Evans tried to help him sort out his past and, at one point, thought he could be the evil Phoenix, Stefano, because of a tattoo on his shoulder. After visiting a cosmetic surgeon who had photos of the missing Roman Brady, Marlena was convinced that the man was none other than her husband Roman. ""Roman"" moved into her house, her bed and her heart. He picked up parenting duties for his daughter, Carrie, and the twins, Sami and Eric, whom he had with Marlena.   After about five years, the real Roman escaped from captivity and returned to Salem. John was shocked to discover that he had been living another man's past and still had no knowledge of his own history. It wasn't until 1992 when Lawrence Alamain's aunt, Vivian, came to Salem. It turned out that John Black was really Forrest, Lawrence's presumed dead brother. Once his inheritance was properly reimbursed from Vivian, who had claimed Forrest's share of the Alamain fortune, John had an independent income for life.   John was shocked to discover that he had been living another man's past and still had no knowledge of his own history.   John then became involved with Isabella Toscano, who became pregnant with his child about the time that Danielle Stevens came to Salem. Danielle claimed to be both John's wife and a private investigator, who was on the trail of the jewel thief Romulus. She led John off to Europe and would have seduced him, but Isabella discovered that Danielle herself was really Romulus. John allowed Danielle to escape, then returned to Salem and wed Isabella. Their son, Brady Black, however, arrived in a church anteroom before the couple exchanged wedding vows. Only a few months later, Isabella died in John's arms of pancreatic cancer.   John never really stopped loving Marlena, the woman who dominated his short remembered history. Even though they acknowledged their love for each other, Marlena was faithful to her husband and dedicated to her family. However, when John announced that he was leaving Salem for good, Marlena gave in to a moment of passion aboard his private jet. That changed everything. John decided to stay in Salem and Marlena found out that she had conceived.   While Marlena was pregnant, John began a love affair with Kristen Blake, who turned out to be already betrothed to Tony DiMera. While John and Kristen embarked on their bumpy romance, Marlena delivered a baby girl, Belle. After Sami Brady brought to light the true paternity of Marlena and John's child, Kristen felt betrayed and married Tony as planned. Stefano captured John and tortured him in a dungeon at Maison Blanche. Marlena tried to seduce Stefano to help John escape. Roman got them both out, then decided to divorce Marlena and left town.   By then, John was committed to Kristen even though she was married to Tony. They could not continue their affair however, because John discovered another piece of his past: he was a priest. That served Marlena well when it became apparent that she was possessed by the devil. She needed to be exorcised, and who better than John, qualified and loving, to do the job? John freed Marlena of Satan and then freed himself of his priestly vows.   John and Kristen planned to find a way to be together, but before Kristen could obtain an annulment, fatally ill Tony committed suicide. In a complex plot, Tony framed John for murder. John was convicted and sentenced to death. He actually inhaled some fumes in the gas chamber before his innocence, through Tony's diary, came to light.   Marlena and John came close to reuniting after John's near death. However, Kristen became pregnant and John proposed marriage. Marlena refused to come between the couple for fear that Kristen would miscarry. However, Kristen had already miscarried, but with Stefano's help, she came up with a pregnant double. The ploy kept John in Kristen's grasp for a long time, but Kristen's double began to assume Kristen's life... and fell for John.   Kristen's double, Susan, locked up both the now scheming Kristen and Marlena and planned to marry John. However, Laura Horton uncovered the plan and exposed both Susan's identity and Kristen's faked pregnancy. John's affection for Kristen changed to utter loathing when he learned that the child was not his. Another shock followed when all of Salem learned that Roman Brady had died on an ISA assignment.   At last, John and Marlena reunited. Before they could marry, Roman returned from the dead. Kristen and Stefano had brought Roman back to Salem, but Roman was suffering from a deadly illness. Marlena could not bring herself to tell the dying Roman that she was in love with John. Determined to win John back, Kristen had already led Roman to believe that she and John were a couple.   Stefano, following his own plans, led John off to the jungle in search of a cure for Roman. John's friend, Hope, followed him, certain that he needed someone to protect him from Stefano's schemes, and during their adventures, John and Hope forged new, deeper bonds. But John's love remained focused on Marlena, and on finding a cure for Roman. With John away, Marlena agreed to grant Roman's dying wish and agreed to marry him. John returned with a cure for Roman, just as Marlena and Roman were about to marry.   After Kristen's ""murder,"" John was finally free to be with the woman he loved. Marlena and John planned to be married, but a couple with more obstacles has never been found. John gave up his search for the past, fearing he would not like the man he was under Stefano's control. John and Marlena went on their honeymoon in Hawaii when Gina, unbeknownst to Stefano, lured John away by faking a drowning. John was temporarily returned to 1985, and his love for Gina. In an unlikely twist, Stefano deactivated John's chip and threw him off the submarine. Stefano no longer trusted Gina and John to work together. Marlena found John's body washed up onshore and rushed him to the hospital. When he woke up, he had no memory of what occurred.   John and Marlena returned to Salem, eager to begin the joy of what should be the comfort and contentment of married life. But it could never be that easy. John and Isabella's son, Brady, moved back in and proved to have a tumultuous relationship with Marlena. The Coronation Massacre occurred, in which John returned to ""mercenary mode"" and pulled many of the injured guests to safety. John also believed for a time that he was the father of Hope's baby, but as the results of the baby switch played out, it was revealed that he wasn't. It was Bo. And John and Marlena were free to continue their beautiful romance.   John started a new business, Basic Black and hired Kate Roberts to run it for him. But the most shocking event to transpire in Salem was the return of Tony DiMera, the believed-dead son of Stefano. He brought John's spy skills to the front, as he and Marlena tried to figure out why Tony had come back. He also had to deal with the arrival in Salem of the Gemini Twins, Rex and Cassie, two ""aliens"" who Marlena wanted to help but who he believed were two more pawns of Stefano.   John and Marlena traveled to DiMera Island to try to learn more about the Twins. Eventually, with both Tony and Rolf's help, the discovered that Marlena had given birth to Rex and Cassie. And Tony was their father. John wasn't happy that there was now a link between Tony and his beloved Doc. John also wasn't happy to learn that he and Tony were half-brothers; they shared a mother, Daphne DiMera. The identity of his father is still a mystery. For a time, it looked as if Tony wanted to reunite with the mother of his children, but after the evil Count tried to kill John by locking him in a sauna, Marlena seemed to side with her husband once and for all.   The arrival in town of the Salem Stalker caused the loss of some of John's closest and dearest friends. His main goal was to uncover the identity of the Stalker; little did he know how close to home this was. He refused to believe his wife Marlena could be the killer, until the evidence stacked up against her was too much to ignore. When Alice called him with the message that Marlena was the killer and was ready to murder the Horton matriarch, John knew he had to stop her. He failed. Later that night, Marlena admitted she was the killer, then the two of them got into an altercation over his gun and she went over the penthouse balcony. When she awoke after the incident, she claimed that JOHN was the killer. Nevertheless, she went to jail for the crime, leaving John devastated. When Marlena ""escaped"" from jail, John tried to save her, but could not. She was shot by a police sharpshooter and died in his arms. He was devastated. He carried his beloved Doc through the streets of Salem and laid her out in church. It wasn't long after she was buried, however, that they discovered that her casket was empty. John became suspicious of a certain island and he and Bo tried to get their on the Basic Black jet. They were shot down, but survived to find their loved ones alive on Tony DiMera's island prison. John and Marlena were reunited, but he was a little suspicious about how close Doc and Roman had gotten while imprisoned together. The next step was escape. As they were finally getting out of Tony's clutches, the evil DiMera created a volcanic eruption, which in turn caused a giant wave. John was injured in his final fight with his half brother and joined the other Salemites on makeshift rafts. The Coast Guard eventually picked most of them up, but Marlena was not among the survivors. And John was paralyzed. Back in Salem, John found himself with another obstacle to his happiness. He was paralyzed and the pain killers were doing no good. It seemed that a DiMera operative was injecting his IV with a dangerous drug. He became addicted to painkillers as he was determined to walk his daughter Belle down the aisle. John did walk Belle down the aisle, but it wasn't long before his addiction was discovered, thanks to savvy Nicole. With Kate's help, he fought the pain and his addiction. She even moved into the Penthouse to help him. It wasn't long before they grew close, so close, in fact, taht they made love. They each believed their loved ones would want them to move on with each other. Finally, John proposed and Kate accepted! Little did they know that Roman and Marlena were arriving in Salem at that very moment.

Alf Rogers scored 39 goals in 125 senior games for Sheffield Wednesday. He was born at Walkley, in Sheffield, a suburb adjacent to Hillsborough and was spotted playing for a local amateur side, Birley Carr.   He was invited to Highbury in 1939 for a trial with Arsenal and was told to return the following season. Alas the outbreak of World War 2 changed that particular arrangement and Alf signed-on for Sheffield Wednesday, part-time, whilst working at a local munitions factory.   Alf was a stocky inside-forward and one of his idols was centre-forward Jackie Robinson. In the first game after the war, in a League North fixture, Wednesday beat Sunderland 6-3 with both Rogers and Robinson each netting a hat-trick.   In the publication The Jackie Robinson Story, the authors recall: Alf Rogers, another of Jackies inside partners was another player who found it hard to get first-team football, due to the wealth of talent in that position, but when he did he always took his chances and played well, partnering Jackie around 22 times.   Just when Alfs talents were coming to fruition, he received a blow in the groin on a pre-season tour to the Netherlands and arthritis cut short his career at the end of the 1949-50 season, a campaign which saw Alf play a part in the Owls promotion to the top tier, scoring four times in eighteen appearances that term.   Alf always remembered a goal he scored against Fulham in 1947 when he struck a shot which opened the scoring in a 2-0 win. On turning to receive his team mates congratulations, he noticed the ball was down by the corner flag.   Alf recalled: The ball had hit a flaw in the net and broken it open. The nets were new that day and manager, Eric Taylor, joked hed provide new nets every game if I could keep finding the flaw with a shot on target!   After his premature retirement as a player, Alf was a regular attender at Owls games through the family shareholding. He worked for some local engineering firms before moving to the Physical Education department at the Goodwin Centre of the University of Sheffield, from where he retired in 1986.   On his visits to Hillsborough in later life, he was often asked by strangers his opinion of players being paid large amounts of cash? As someone who had played for a weekly sum of 5 a week, with perhaps a 5 win bonus, Alf would reply: We never thought about the money. All we wanted to do was roll up those blue and white sleeves and run out and play for your local club!

[ edit ]   Music   Big Bad Shakin' play a modern style of Rock n Roll music. They use components of the Revival Rock 'n' Roll of the 1970s, traditional 50s R'n'R mixing it with modern music styles such as Rap, HipHop, Skate Punk or Grunge. Amongst their main influences the band quotes Shakin' Stevens & The Sunsets, Crazy Cavan & The Rhythm Rockers, Big Joe Turner, Run DMC and Sex Pistols.   Big Bad Shakin' write and perform their own song material with themes ranging from the traditional love story to job loss to or the Saturday night binge at a working man's club. Mainly their fans refer to band's musical style as ""Rockin' Cartoon Pop"" referring to song titles such as ""Crazy Pullover"" or their stage action which often includes eating chocolade bars and drinking advocaat. Rockin' Cartoon Pop may be considered a side stream of the  Timid Tiger's  definition of ""Cartoon Pop"" music. Though a musical parallel can not be drawn, Big Bad Shakin' listeners claim having identified a new style of music in the band's performance. In the UK, however, Big Bad Shakin' are mostly announced as playing ""Take no prisoners total Rock 'n' Roll"" focusing on the powerfulness of the music style.   Their fans also call the four guys ""probably the craziest band around"" in reference to their stage appearance, show and, most likely, personality.       [ edit ]   History   Big Bad Shakin' first got together in the summer of 1997 when they were asked to replace the headline Rock 'n' Roll act at an open air gig in Germany with an audience of about 2,000. After a period of solo projects they re-connected in late 2002 with a new bass player and began writing and performing self-penned material. In 2005 the band acquired a new drummer and had to replace the guitar player after he had left. Despite the necessary changes, their music remained the way it was.       [ edit ]   Publications   1.

From the lower classes to the upper classes, each one has conducted in criminal acts from the often false illusion of the highway robbers, who were in fact just muggers to upper class crimes like embezzlement, tax evasion and fraud. Therefore to look at power, law and authority you need to first have an understanding of why attitudes and laws were implemented plus why the law sometimes protected some but ignored others.   The pre-bureaucratic state very much depended on the threat of death to stop people from committing crime due to there being no criminal justice system and perhaps due to the state being weak and needing to show their authority in symbolic executions due to it being hard to pass information due to it being hard to travel, therefore easier to make punishment harsh and symbolic to act as a deterrent. The pre-bureaucratic state used torture frequently to punish those who broke the law and public executions were very much part of public life. It was not uncommon for thousands of people to attend the public executions and this also acted as a good deterrent for the state to strike fear into those who may have thought about breaking the law. But his system of law was abolished in 1790 with the last execution.   Once the bureaucratic state was implemented in the ninetieth century, it brought with it the police state. The implementation of the police state bought greater power to the state and therefore was no longer a need for the symbolic public executions that had been widespread in the previous centuries. Due to the large numbers of police and the implementation of the judicial system and the services and introduction of the penitentiary system resulted in a new system of punishing the mind of the criminal, which was an alternative way of punishment to the previous way of punishment which was to punish the body of the criminal.   The law has often been unfair towards the poorer citizens of a society, due to the power the richer members of society had and the relatively powerless lower classes. An example of this is that of an eighteenth century woman who stole a fish, she was caught and went to trial for hanging. The law was harsh for petty crime, thieves were easily caught and the trials very quick, some as short as five minutes long and many cases implemented no defence for the defendant. During and after the eighteenth century the law was intensified against the poorer classes due to societies view that the lawlessness of these classes were going against the society that was trying to be constructed, a society based spoken definitions of order.   Power, law and authority circled around crime and the laws passed to prevent crime were based on the power of classes and the states authority on its citizens. Crime in the eighteenth century was very much based around fear. The impact of crime was also pushed into the background while the need for reduction in crime was much about the fear it caused those it impacted upon and the fear of social change itself. For a century and a half it has been next to impossible to perceive the meaning of crime except through ideological filters Therefore crime during this period was very much focused upon those people that the state deemed as vagrant and part of a deviant culture. This resulted in the formation of the police-state, which showed two faces of British law. The first was that to protect its citizens, the second was to oppress and curb popular feeling within society. But the latter point was not as unruly as it sounds due to there being a rule of law.   Power, Law and Authority were very much intertwined with crime and one another in recent history. Those who held power tended to fear those with no power and therefore influenced law to help protect themselves from lower class deviants. The law obviously is meant to be followed and those that dont follow such laws should be punished but the question should be asked that were these laws there to protect every citizen of a nation or just those in power. Certainly before the bureaucratic state was implemented, the law does seem to punish those deviants publicly as a symbolic act to strike fear into the other deviants such as thieves, prostitutes and drunks to not carry out such actions as to push those in authority and power to react. It is also an important point that crime was very much about fear in past centuries, not the impact it had upon society and the economy. Therefore in conclusion it is important to understand the way in which society was run when trying to understand such points. A society with has not yet embraced the enlightenment will therefore follow religious and authoritarian leadership which will include keeping the poor, poor, and the rich powerful and the law will be implemented and acted on to keep such structure in place to keep society running based on fear and authority.

Sirius also signposts applicants on to other potential sources of funding and has excellent working relationships with local banks and other traditional business support agencies. Sirius unique managed partnership approach allows a co-ordinated and focused delivery of a range of in-house business support services. This includes an agreed pick-and-mix approach to a managed range of monitored business advice and support, and continuous counselling for as long as the client requires.   As important as the initial seed money to clients is the advice, support and mentoring provided before, during and after start-up. This is what makes Sirius distinctive and precious to its clients. Sirius relationships with clients and partners are nurtured by confidence  our confidence in their plans; their confidence in our service - trust and long-term vision. Though an SME, Sirius is also an agent for change. Because it is supported by BP, with responsibility for enhancing BPs reputation locally and is aligned with the values and standards held by BP, Sirius encourages its clients to be best in class, coaching them to continuous improvement whether in financial, HSE or social performance. It provides access to quality IT, business and financial training for these SMEs where appropriate.   From a shop front location on the local high street in Hedon, Sirius has achieved UK Enterprise Agency status, the only such agency in The East Riding Of Yorkshire. By creating Sirius, BP has changed lives and will go on changing lives for the good, providing local people with the opportunity to build for their own future through self-employment.   Sirius allocates business loans to those enterprises, approved by the Sirius board, which complement the overall objectives and relate to a key theme. Approved themes are:    Local job creation  Development of young people  Local enterprise development  Training and education   Resources BP invested 1 million into a revolving loan fund at the start of the programme and committed a further 500,000 in 2005. This seed funding is intended to act as pump-priming finance to lever other sources of funding from donor agencies. All loans are considered against strict criteria established by BP and vetted by Sirius before submission of any application to the Loan Board.   The diversity of small businesses supported by Sirius is impressive. They range from organic mushroom farming to commercial embroidery, garden furniture to interior design, nursery schools to IT businesses and garages.

We are fully integrated and play a very important part in the local communities enterprise organisations. We are also involved with many local investment steering committees, and work closely with the universities.    Sirius has developed a strong reputation for partnership and inclusive working with other agencies, and for sharing information and financial risk, for example with local banks and The Princes Trust.    Sirius offers a very flexible service to small businesses, responding to individual needs. This is possible because of close relationships, which Sirius staff have nurtured with the entrepreneurs. Should the initiative expand significantly over the next few years, this personal touch may well be more difficult to maintain. However, the business manager is adamant that Sirius will remain free from those bureaucratic hurdles which, perhaps, deter small businesses from using some of the other available agencies    Sirius does not offer generic training programmes on business matters such as cash flow and marketing - it signposts entrepreneurs on to other agencies which offer these courses. Rather, it focuses its efforts on practical, individually tailored advice for each business or loan applicant.    Sirius visibility in the community has been identified as one reason for its immediate success. The offices prominent high street location is considered a valuable asset, allowing potential entrepreneurs to drop in and ask questions in a non-threatening environment. It also reinforces the notion that the initiative is an integral part of the community and not tucked away behind BP gates.   The on-going management support of BP, beyond their initial financial commitment, demonstrates the companys commitment to the community beyond its core operations and its supply chains.

Experience proves that it is possible to retain brand recognition and reputational benefits within a collective endeavour, even among competitors. Often, the fact that major competitors prove they are willing to work together on social investment projects can enhance licence to operate and reputation with host communities and governments, while boosting local enterprise development and job creation.   Sirius business manager Alan Gordon-Freeman comments, Our aims are to help to create sustainable businesses in the 'drive to work' area of Saltend. This creates local wealth, a better choice of career for future employees, local pride, ambition, a higher level of training and skills, reduced crime, and a better community in general.

Sirius also signposts applicants on to other potential sources of funding. Our excellent relations with the local banks are key in this regard.   Partnership is of the essence for Sirius. It works very closely with local commercial banks, Technical Education Centres, Business Links (a national network of/for enterprise support), local business advice centres, the Princes Trust, local chambers of trade and commerce and the two county councils. Rather than providing training directly, Sirius signposts applicants on to local training agencies.     [ edit ]   SIRIUS (BP)   Sirius is a unique partnership established by BP Chemicals at Saltend, Hull, investing in the economic future of the local area. Sirius can offer business loans for local people seeking to establish a business in the area, or to expand an already successful business in Hull and the surrounding areas. Launched in September 1999 with a 1 million investment from BP, Sirius has so far given help and advice to hundreds of people hoping to start up in business or to expand through start-up loans and free advice, and the demand for its services is still growing!   Since the first business loans were allocated in March 2000, Sirius has helped to create over 600 new jobs in over 125 very diverse organisations. Those who have taken advantage of Sirius free advice and support have created approximately 700 further jobs. It has issued 867k of loans, which has levered in a further 4.4m of investment from traditional sources. Sirius input has produced one job per 1406 invested.   The overarching aim of Sirius is to create sustainable local jobs in existing companies and to assist with the set up of new micro businesses. This is achieved by providing specialist advice and guidance on business planning, sources of financial assistance and by building individual capacity to deal with all aspects of business management. It is a community-based project aiming to assist those individuals currently at a disadvantage through lack of clear advice and guidance on business planning, basic business management skills and access to affordable finance. The project is dedicated to the creation of sustainable jobs in the relatively economically and socially deprived geographical area surrounding the BP site.

Crumb . Crumb has been drawing the adventures of this small, bearded street mystic since the mid-'60s, and still draws him today. First appearing in Crumb's sketchbook, the character made his public debut in the magazine ""Yarrowstalks"". Part wiseman, part con man, Mr. Natural has strange, magical powers and posseses cosmic insight, but is also moody, cynical, self-pitying, and suffers from various strange sexual obsessions. He is endlessly being accosted by would-be disciples seeking the truth (among them such long-running Crumb characters as Flakey Foont and Shuman the human). He typically regards them with amused condescention and a certain affection, although his patience often wears thin and he takes a sadistic pleasure in making them feel like idiots. While he is typically very cool and in control, he sometimes ends up in humiliating predicaments like getting tossed in jail for child molestation or languishing for years in a mental institution. In recent years he has entered into a tempestuous relationship with  Devil Girl , another popular Crumb character. Enormously popular during the  underground comics  fad of the '60s and '70s and still enjoying a cult following today, Mr. Natural has been endlessly merchandised, being sold as a plastic, decorative statue, on bumper stickers, posters, t-shirts, etc.     [ edit ]   Sources   Sources:  Comic Book Confidential (film);  Crumb  (film);  Hup  (R.

He was sighted constantly for well over a year on the  MMORPG ,  Star Wars Galaxies .   Arriving as a refugee on  Tatooine , he entered with no true understanding of what he was to do. However, through several near death situations fighting the nunas of  Tatooine , he realised that his hands were not for hand to hand combat. Ristohonk took up the profession of Rifleman and quickly gained the basic skills required to survive. However, for too long he did not advance due to inerest in other projects. Due to his obsession with Tatooine, he adopted an all-white uniform, consisting of a headwrap, boots, shirt, jacket and a skirt, to help blend with the sand.   His side projects included working towards becoming a  Jedi  under the now forgotten  Holocron  system. His first three holocrons were: architect, dancer and droid engineer.   Ristohonk however stayed an architect for months, enjoying his role of building structures far cheaper than most others. However, his windfall came in the introduction of paintings at Tatooine's central hub,  Bestine . Ristohonk, due to his inquisitive nature was among the first to purchase the schematic, place it in his factory and mass produce hundreds of paintings. As a result of being the first, Ristohonk was able to sell at the price of 100 thousand credits per painting. A mere month later after everybody had realised where paintings came from, they were worth no more than 5 thousand credits each. Ristohonk was able to make 20 million credits from this venture in a short amount of time.   Ristohonk set up a business relationship with Thompson Jamoboree, who ran the  Coronet  Mall, the biggest player-run shop in the Naritus galaxy. While Ristohonk supplied paintings for cash, he also did many loot runs for Thompson, which included pieces of  Death Star  debris, broken [lightsaber]s, animal cages and many other easily attained yet secret loots which were easily sold for many thousand credits each.   Ristohonk's favourite early activity was slaughtering  Jawas  for the fact that they often carried force crystals, worth a lot of money. However, Ristohonk soon realised that  Tusken Raiders , otherwise known as  Sand People  carried far more crystals in their stronghold of  Fort Tusken . Shortly before Ristohonk was due to flee, he carried in excess of 50 force crystals with him, as well as tens of millions of credits.   Ristohonk's disappearance however was unexpected and a sign of the Empire's will to destroy all rebels. Ristohonk, a devoted Rebel, broke the Empire's rules for mating by engaging in a one-night-stand with a Wookiee at the  Mos Eisley  Cantina. The wookiee as a result was pregnant with a child; a child of mixed kerra and human breed. It was shortly realised that the wookiee would be killed and Ristohonk tortured for his disrespect to the Empire's laws. Fortunately, he was able to go unnoticed up until his daughter's birth. Ristohonk named his daughter ""Ploppy"". To ensure that Ploppy's life would go unnoticed by the Empire, Ristohonk was forced to place her in a capsule and send her away to a far away galaxy.   Ristohonk himself was forced to flee, albeit via a different path, although he was forced to give up everything he had worked for in his house, treasures and money. Ploppy's mother was killed shortly after for fear of giving birth to a ""freak"". Little did the Empire ever find out that this ""Freak"", due to cross-breeding and galactic radiation became a cat-like creature. Highly fortunately however, Ploppy, after drifting in space for 25 years, arrived on the planet of Norrath. Frightingly, she encountered many other cat-like creatures, called ""Kerra"", who she identifies with. After being taken in by Norrath's most evil ruler,  Lucan D'Lere , Ploppy's main focus now is to meet her parents, whom she has no idea are or what has happened to them.   Ristohonk vows to one day meet up with Ploppy. When that day comes in unknown.

The curriculum is comparable to that of the national standard EMT-I/99 (EMT-Intermediate - I/99). AEMT-CCs are ALS, or Advanced Life Support, Providers. Becoming an AEMT-CC involves a great deal of work. The pre-requisite is that a person must pocess a current EMT-Basic certification, although it is recommended that they also have at least one year of experience at that level. They must complete approximately 240 hours of classroom time, in which they learn Anatomy and Physiology, as well as signs, symptoms, and treatments relating to Trauma as well as medical emergencies including but not lmitied to Respiratory, Cardiac, Diebetic, and OB/GYN. While in class they must additionally spend time outside of the classroom observing in various clinical settings such as the ER, the OR, the CCU, with a Respiratory Therapist, or in Labor and Delivery. Also outside of the classroom during the course, the AEMT-CC student must be precepted doing many calls in the field by a AEMT-CC or Paramedic. Lastly, they pass a state practical skills exam and a state written exam. AEMT-CC skills include venous access, medication administration, endotracheal intubation, ECG interpretation, electrical cardiac therapy, needle chest decompression, intraosseous access, as well as all BLS or Basic Life Support skills. In areas where there are few Paramedics, due to scarcity of EMS providers or a lack of an accessible Paramedic class, Critical Care Technicians may be the highest level of pre-hospital care. AEMT-CCs, like all EMS providers, work under the proticols of medical direction whether it be in the form of standing orders or the contacting of medical control. New York has 18 regional EMS councils, some of which are comprised of a single county, while others are comprised of many counties. Each region must establish its own medical direction and as a result the proticols which providers in the field must follow vary based on the needs of the region. In some regions there is a big difference between Critical Care Technicians and Paramedics with regards to standing orders and skills allowed to be performed, while in others the two levels function on or very close to the same level. A major reason why people choose a Critical Care class as opposed to a Paramedic one, is that the amount of time required is significantly less. That makes the Critical Care level more appealing for volunteers who want to go beyond BLS, but don't intend on making a career out of EMS. Also, many Critical Care classes are offered through county EMS offices and are free to people who are active members of agencies within that county. Many Paramedic classes within New York are held through community colleges and therefore are costly not only in time, but also money due to the cost of tuition.

In his creative exploits, Mr. Mosher employs a combination of elements, techniques and influences that pulls inspiration from the past yet looks forward to the future. The end result is an evocative mix of sometimes disparate musical genres and artistic motivation into an invigorating, dramatic whole. One could use the term experimental but his vision remains dynamic, progressive and modern.   Beginning with his first CD, Ambient Earth, released in 1996, Scott began to carve a path for himself regardless of boundaries, constraints and more fortuitiously, music industry support. He continued on this road with the release of Virtuality in 2001 and Inferno in 2004 and his fourth - and newest - CD, Deep Horizon.   Deep Horizon is a dynamic and ambitious musical journey, synthesizing a diverse range of musical influences under the mantle of contemporary progressive metal. Built upon a foundation of crushing guitar tones, subtle odd meter rhythms, atmospheric keyboard sounds, and powerful vocal melodies (courtesy of Wind Wraith/Live After Death/InnerStrength singer Scott Oliva) Deep Horizon breaks new ground in the world of progressive metal and makes for another distinguished artistic statement.   In addition to arranging, composing, and performing all the music on this self-produced CD, his creative vision is further solidified in his striking and symbolic artwork that serves as a visual reference point for the lyrics themes alluded to on Deep Horizon.   Although he has never appeared on the Arsenio Hall Show, won a Grammy Award, graced the cover of ROLLING STONE magazine or been involved in a corporate embezzlement schemes, Scott continues to ply his trade with determination and a great set of Ginzu knives. For all the emphasis placed upon his art as a hybrid of styles, ideals and emotions, his music stands as a personal artistic statement - yet fits all head sizes.

N  is the first  multicultural   sorority  founded in the  Southeastern United States  and the fastest growing of its kind. In the spring of 1996, Founding Monarch Melissa Jo Murchison-Blake was in search of sisterhood. She wanted to be part of a family that openly embraced all women and crossed cultural boundaries. As a bi-racial woman, she did not want to choose between historically Caucasian or African-American sororities. Founding Monarch Murchison-Blake felt that if she did choose one, she would be denying half of her heritage.   Still wanting to be part of a strong sisterhood, Founding Monarch Murchison-Blake recruited six other women to join hands in her quest to found Theta Nu Xi Multicultural Sorority. At first, the Founding Monarchs were discouraged from fulfilling their vision. The Director of Greek Affairs advised them to consider joining an existing organization, expressing his concern that a new Greek organization, based on the principal of multiculturalism, would not survive at UNC-CH. However, the Founding Monarchs believed there was a need for such a sisterhood. Their efforts set the stage for Theta Nu Xi's presence in the Greek, non-Greek, and surrounding communities.   After much work and dedication, the Founding Monarchs built the foundation for Theta Nu Xi. Finally, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill officially recognized Theta Nu Xi Multicultural Sorority as the Alpha Chapter on April 11, 1997. With the collaborative efforts of the Founding Monarchs and the Sisters of Spring 1998, the organization grew beyond our expectations. The Sorority incorporated on April 29, 1999, and with the participation of the Alpha Chapter and Beta and Gamma Colonies, the National Organization was founded at the first annual National Convention on August 21, 1999.       [ edit ]   Foundations   The mission of Theta Nu Xi is to promote leadership, multiculturalism, and self-improvement through academic excellence, involvement in and service to the campus and community, as well as being living examples of sisterhood across different races, cultures, religions, backgrounds, and lifestyles. Theta Nu Xi's tenets are Scholarship, Service, Sisterhood, Leadership, and Multiculturalism.

The dangers of getting it wrong with nanotech are far greater and wider ranging than they ever were with genetic modification.    The UK government is currently running a consultation on the regulation of nanotechnology. The only proposal on the table is a voluntary notification scheme for new nanotech products. This will give nanotech companies free reign to introduce nanomaterials into consumer products - unlabelled, untested and unregulated.   It is important that the corporations do not have a free run on the regulation of this new technology, but that everyone has their say in how and whether nanotechnology is introduced into our world. Please take part in the DEFRA consultation, and ensure that every section of society has its voice heard.   Tell DEFRA that their voluntary scheme is unacceptable  tell them that they should act in a precautionary way and heed the warnings on nanotech.

If you would like to attend contact:  nano.technology@defra.gsi.gov.uk.    If you are unfamiliar with the concepts, issues and dangers of nanotechnology, please read the following short introduction to the current situation and follow up the links to further reading.     Ever heard of nano-technology? Chances are you are already using it on your skin, wearing it in your clothes or maybe even eating it in your food. Despite a long list of danger warnings on nanomaterials (products made from nanotechnology) the UK Government, under pressure from industry, has decided that it does not want to regulate or be careful with this new technology. The Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) has proposed a rule that would give nanotech companies free reign to introduce whatever nanomaterials they like into consumer products - unlabelled, untested and unregulated. Just as they did with GM Foods, the government is playing for the corporations over a risky new technology. Its time to cry foul and send nanotech offside. Tell DEFRA today that you want nanotech products taken off the shelves until they have studied the dangers and are prepared to regulate and label them. Remind them they are supposed to protect the public not the nanotech companies.   What is Nanotech? Nanotechnology involves the manufacture of invisibly small particles and new materials designed so that the atoms are arranged in new ways. By rearranging matter at this tiny scale traditional materials change their properties. For example zinc oxide, a chemical used in sunscreens, becomes transparent instead of white when it is made out of nanosize particles. Other materials become explosive, reactive or extremely toxic as a result of shrinking particles to the nano-size   Which products will use nanotech? Nanotech particles are already being used quietly in a wide range of consumer products. L'Oreal and Boots use nanoparticles in sunscreens and cosmetics, the Gap and Next are putting nanoparticles in clothes to make them stain and wrinkle resistant, Smith and Nephew are putting them in bandages while chemical company BASF are putting nanoparticles in food additives into drinks. Meanwhile Unilever and Nestle are working on nanoparticle ice cream. Unfortunately products that contain nanomaterials do not have to be labeled and the nanomaterials are far too small for the consumer to detect. The companies who are developing nanotech hope to incorporate nanotechnology across all consumer products in the next ten years.   Is it safe? Nanotechnology is a new set of technologies and safety studies have only just begun. However there are already a lot of warning signs that nanoparticles in particular are more toxic than larger particles and show the same health problems as particles that come out of car exhausts. For example:     Metal oxide nanoparticles (such as Zinc oxide) used in sunscreens have been show to produce toxic effects in skin cells and studies are now ongoing to see how deeply they can penetrate the skin.   A class of nanoparticles known as fullerenes have been shown to cause toxic effects in the lungs of mice, brain damage in fish and kill soil bacteria.   The Royal Society (the leading organisation of scientists in the UK) has warned that new nanomaterials should be tested as new materials, that environmental uses of nanoparticles should be prohibited and that any nanoparticles escaping from factories should be treated as hazardous. The Royal Society also recommended that any products containing nanomaterials be labeled for consumers.   In April 2006 a nano cleaning product called 'magic nano' was recalled in Germany after 76 people were admitted to hospital with breathing problems. Its not clear what caused this but the German Authorities suspect that the nanoparticles in the product may be to blame.     Is it fair? Nanotech is already changing the way things are made and may put many workers and small farmers out of business. For example, cotton, rubber and copper, on which the economies of several developing nations depend, all stand to be replaced by new nanomaterials. Just as biotechnologys ability to manipulate genes went hand in hand with the patenting of life, so too nanotechnologys ability to manipulate molecules has led to the patenting of matter. Corporations are already taking out broad ranging monopoly patents on nano-scale discoveries and inventions.   Who's behind it? The usual suspects. This technology is being developed first and foremost by the worlds most powerful countries and largest corporations. Not only is nanotech being developed to make large companies bigger profits but will also be used to develop powerful new weapons. Nanotech is dominated by the Fortune 500 companies. From computers to chemicals, from oil to pharmaceuticals, from cosmetics to food the likes of IBM, DuPont, Syngenta, Exxon, Pfizer, L'Oreal and Kraft are all involved in nanotech.   What is the government proposing? To do nothing! The government admits there is a problem but is afraid to upset the nanotech companies - therefore it is only going to bring in a very weak voluntary registration of nano-products. If there could be a problem all nanotech products should be taken off the shelves until they are properly understood.   What can you do about it? Tell DEFRA that their voluntary scheme is unacceptable  tell them that they should act in a precautionary way and heed the warnings on nanotech.

Identity projects must be able to cater to changing needs. Adaptability and flexibility are key in a world where business models and processes continuously evolve to match market demands.   Organizations have existing sets of applications and IT infrastructure in production that serves existing needs well, but cannot or should not be modified. However, these applications have valuable identity information may be essential in new projects, if it were accessible in some manner.   In addition, most organizations want to leverage as much of the original, native functionality of its ""off the shelf"" applications without resorting to complex, tightly bound integration.   Without a proper identity infrastructure, these constraints can tremendously impact schedule, cost, and effectiveness of an IdM deployment. Projects such as access management, provisioning tools, and other identity-driven software need complete and integrated identity data. Each application, however, wants data it its own schema and tree structure, with a set of attributes that it can control. This is why virtual directory services are so critical today. Solving integration challenges, without modifying the original data source or application, is best achieved through virtualization. This is driving principle behind the RadiantOne Virtual Directory Server.  RadiantOne Virtualization Benefits  RadiantOne combines Virtual Directory technology with high performance directory services, dynamic access, integration and synchronization to provide a complete identity infrastructure. By using RadiantOne, enterprises can: Speed deployment of identity projects and easily solve complex integration requirements. Reduce administrative effort and cost associated with administering data in multiple locations. Provide the right infrastructure to painlessly accommodate future identity requirements.

For 1.29 you got the Hess Tanker Truck which you could fill with water then squirt out a hose. Nowadays these trucks go for 1400-2000 dollars depending on condition. Hess has been making these toy trucks for over 40 years with 2005 being there 41st year.Introduced in 1998 during late Ma and early june they started putting out Hess minis which were replicas of previous trucks. These can be purchased for 5.99. The models that are considered most popular are the 1966 Hess Voyager which is the one and only boat, the 1980 Hess Training Van which many consider to be the finest one yet, and the 1999 Hess Space Shuttle which marks the new Millenium. The Hess Truck has evolved over the years by including numerous firetrucks, tankers, tractor trailors, and even a plane and a helicopter. There also rarer trucks that are only given out to certain people like the '95 and 2002 chrome which were given out at a stockholder meeting. These now go for anywhere between 700-2000. More recently they gave out a 2006 commerative truck to all the workers for the NYSE for the changing of there name from Amerada Hess Corporation to just Hess Corporation. Hess Trucks have evolved over the years but the trucks still bring happiness to children on Christmas and even to adlts when they see a Hess Truck.

[ edit ]   A Concise History of the City of Nanjing: How it Relates to the City You See Today   Nanjing is a port city on the Yangtze River and hence lies in an area outside of the birthplace of Chinese civilization on the plains of Northern China. Because of this it has no reliable history prior to the Han dynasty, the first to rule an area roughly equivalent to modern China. The first bits of clear evidence concerning the site appear during the Spring and Autumn Period. The town was an important site for the forging of swords by the kingdom of Wu and was known as Yecheng (city of metallurgy). It is said to have been located on and around Yeshan Hill near the present-day Chaotian Palace and operated between 495 and 473 B.C. In 473 B.C. the state of Wu was conquered by the state of Yue which built a town somewhere in the vicinity to the south of todays Zhonghua Gate known as Yuecheng. And during the Warring States Period the state of Chu built a town in the area in and around Qinglingshan Park, known as Jinling (gold mound). Finally, during the Qin and Han dynasties the area was known as Moling (hay mound). The city on Qingliang Hill was expanded at the end of the Han dynasty and a city wall almost six miles in length was built around the Chu city. This city is popularly known as the Stone City, (shitoucheng) and its remains can be seen in at Qingliang Park. All during these periods Nanjing was of only small political importance.   It is during the period of the Three Kingdoms and the Six Dynasties (between the Han and Sui dynasties that ruled a unified China), that Nanjing first became a major political center. During these times it was known by the names Jianye and Jiankang. During the Three Kingdoms Period, the city was the capital of the Kingdom of Wu, though it lost this distinction in 280 when the Jin dynasty briefly reunified China. Tradition holds that the first Wu emperor, Sun Quan, was buried on Meihua Hill just to the south of the Ming tomb on Purple Mountain. In 317 the emperors of Jin fled to Nanjing and made it their capital. It remained the capital of the six southern dynasties until 589 when the whole of China was again united under the Sui dynasty. During this period the rulers in Nanjing viewed themselves as the repository for Chinese culture as non-Chinese ruled the northern dynasties. Nanjing flourished economically and became a major production center for silk, ceramics and metalworking. Estimates put its population in the neighborhood of 300,000 households during this time. Buddhism made huge inroads into Chinese culture during this period and Nanjing had scores of famous temples; three of these being todays Jiming Temple, Linggu Temple on Purple Mountain, and Qixia Temple to the northeast of Nanjing. The earliest of the grottos at Qixia Temple date from its establishment there in 489.   Though the conquering Sui sacked the city in 589. The Sui rulers were very worried that Nanjing might emerge as a center of resistance. To prevent this, they completely razed the city and went so far as to plow under the foundations of the buildings. Because of this, virtually no trace remains of the city prior to the Sui dynasty. Despite this destruction, Nanjing quickly recovered during the Tang dynasty and was an important economic center. After being devastated during civil unrest at the end of the Tang, it was rebuilt anew in 920 to serve as the capital of a local dynasty, the Southern Tang. The square walls of this 10th century city were the base that the first Ming emperor used when constructing his walls around the city more than 400 years later. The old walls lay along the same lines as the current southern wall with the Zhonghua Gate as the main south entrance. The eastern outline of these walls can still be seen on a map of modern Nanjing as the moat has survived in the form of urban streams. They ran north from Tongjimen to the east of modern Longpan Road and then west to the south of modern Zhujian and Guangzhou Roads past the south entrance to Nanjing University. From here there is less certainty where they lay. Some studies show them running south along modern Shanghai and Muchou Roads where they joined up again with the Ming walls at Shuiximen. Others show them looping around Wutaishan and meeting up with the Ming walls just north of Hanzhongmen. It appears that these walls were largely left standing when the new, improved Ming walls were built. They are mostly made of stone, while the other parts of the Ming wall that were clearly new are mostly made of brick.   This city had an inner walled area called the zicheng where the Southern Tang emperor had his palace city. The exact location of this palace city is not known, but it is know that the court had a summer palace and temples built on Qingliang Hill where the old Stone City once stood.     Approximate Relation of Various Nanjing City Walls   Nanjing was captured in 975 by the Song dynasty. During the Song period Nanjing was a provincial capital. When the Song capital at Kaifeng fell in 1126 the Song court fled to Nanjing temporarily before establishing a new capital in Hangzhou. During this period and during the Yuan dynasty, the former palace city was used as administrative offices for the local prefecture. The Song emperors used it as a detached palace, however, and improved and expanded it during their rule. The site of Fuzimiao, the Temple of Confucius, was chosen during this period and it served as the local state-run academy then and later. Apparently Chaotian Palace was the site of an important Taoist temple during this period and was later the Central Taoist Registry for Nanjing during the Ming dynasty, though none of the literature on site indicates this was so.   The first Ming emperor was proclaimed in 1368 and a great deal of preparation was done prior to this to have an imperial city and all the imperial trappings ready in time. The name of the city was changed again to Yingtianfu (responding to heaven). A ""new city"" was built to the east of the old one to be used as a new palace or ""forbidden"" city. This city was laid out in much the same pattern as Beijing; indeed Nanjings was the pattern for Beijings Forbidden City.   Today little remains of the Ming palace. In Wuchaomen Park, the remains of one of the Wu Gate still stands, and the stream with its five marble bridges just to the north are still to be seen. Little else remains. The Temples of Heaven and Earth were located just outside the city wall to the south of the modern Guanghuamen area, roughly where the railroad runs now between the Qinhuai River and the old moat. The gate in the wall here was called the Chengyang Gate but the name was later changed to Guanghua Gate. From here a bridge led over the moat to the Hongwu Gate. This was the main entrance to the palace city. A broad boulevard lined with roofed corridors led north from here to the Forbidden City. Known as the Imperial Way (yudao), it was flanked on the east with offices for five of the six ministries and with the five military commissions on the west. This road is still called Yudao Street today. Somewhere near modern Ruijin Road, the Imperial Way passed through a second set of walls at the Chengtian Gate and then on through a third set of walls at the Wu Gate. Each of these inner sets of walls was roughly square and was pierced by four gates in each of the cardinal directions. The moat from the innermost set is clearly visible on a map as the canals that surround the Old Ming Palace Plaza and Wuchaomen Park. The Imperial Ancestor Temple (taimiao) was located inside the second set of walls in the southeast corner, somewhere in the southeast corner of Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics.   In expanding the walls, it appears the Hongwu Emperor intended initially to simply add a bulge to the existing walls and encompass the New City to the east. The main north gate would have been the Drum Tower. However, a decision was made to bring Lion Hill to the northwest into the city defenses for strategic reasons, and this almost doubled the area the walls would encompass. In addition to the surviving walls of stone and brick, an outwall was built along the river and to the south as an additional defensive measure. Old maps show that there were close to twenty walls in this rammed earth wall. This outwall is long gone, but the names of the gates survive as local place names. Part of the wall on the south shore of Xuanwu Lake was built on the foundations of the old Stone City walls from the Six Dynasties period, and reused many of the bricks from that old wall.   Originally, thirteen gates were built through Nanjings walls, but this number had grown to eighteen by the end of the Qing dynasty. Of the thirteen original gates, only Zhonghua Gate in the south, originally known as Zhubao Gate, and Heping Gate in the north, originally called Shenci Gate, are still standing. Heping Gate is closed to the public as it is still used as an army barracks. Parts of other gates survive or have been partially reconstructed. The remains of a west gate, Hanzhongmen, originally called Shichengmen, stand in the middle of a plaza. These walls are part of the last of a series of three or four courtyards that made up the gate complex. During the Qing dynasty three more gates were added, including an entrance to Xuanwu Lake from the west built in 1910. Yijiang Gate on North Zhongshan Road was built in 1921, as was the major entrance to the city during Republican times when most visitors to the city arrived by boat at the docks just to the west. Additional gates were added in 1929, 1932 & 1954 to improve traffic and older gates were torn down for the same reason.   In addition, a new Imperial University called Guozijian was built just to the east of Jiming Temple where the Nanjing City Offices are located today. Records indicate that this school had an enrollment of almost 10,000 in 1422, many of these from foreign nations such as Korea, Vietnam & Thailand. The office of the Ministry of Justice was built on the northeast shore of Xuanwu Lake, to the north of the city. The Censorate and the execution grounds were here also. The archives for tax a census records were kept safe in special warehouses located on the largest island on the lake. The lake and its environs were used mostly as a retreat for the imperial family and important court officials. In 1381 the emperor began work on his tomb on Purple Mountain and was buried there in 1398. This is the only Ming Tomb not near the other twelve in Beijing. (The Hongwu Emperors grandson and immediate successor, the Qianwan Emperor, either burned to death in the imperial palace or was sent away secretly to a monastery and has no imperial tomb.)   In 1402 the fourth son of Hongwu, marched from his base near Beijing and seized control of the state from his nephew. During this campaign many of Nanjings historical buildings, including much of the Forbidden City, were destroyed. Though reconstruction was begun, it was never properly finished as the new Yongle emperor moved the capital to Beijing in 1421. One major architectural work that Yongle managed to finish was the famous Porcelain Pagoda, which stood outside the city walls just to the south of Zhonghua Gate. This pagoda was considered one of the marvels of China, but was destroyed by the Taipings during their occupation of the city in the mid-1800s. All during the Ming dynasty, Nanjing remained a secondary capital and was given its current name, meaning south capital at that time. It remained an important center of government throughout the Ming dynasty, but was clearly a second city to Beijing.   When the Manchus seized China in 1644 they made Nanjing the seat of government for the Viceroy of Jiangnan, an area consisting of modern Jiangsu, Jiangxi and Anhui provinces. They also changed the citys name to Jiangning. The Manchus were concerned about retaining their ethnic identity while ruling such a vast country as China, and in order to separate themselves from the ethnic Chinese they set apart portions of the cities they conquered where only Manchus could live. To do so in Nanjing they built a new wall inside the city that gave them the area of the old palace city. The second wall of the Ming palace city was gone by then, but apparently the innermost wall was still standing. This wall ran north and south along modern Longpan Road and then east and west along modern Houzaimen Street. The Viceroys office was located just outside these walls on the site of a Ming Princes Palace where the republican-era Presidential Palace stands today.   The urban-rural mix during the Ming and Qing dynasties was very interesting. It was not the case that urbanization occurred only inside the city walls and there were many open fields inside. The old city was the most heavily populated area and the northwest of the city was mostly vegetable gardens and barracks for the local garrisons. The area south of Zhonghuamen was heavily urbanized and was the site of several important Buddhist temples including Baoen Temple, site of the Porcelain Pagoda. The area around Fuzimaio and the Qinhaui River was where many wealthy families lived. Hongwu had ordered a series of 16 state-run brothels built in this area to aid in attracting people to his capital. The main docks on the Yangtze River were located outside the city walls, of course. They were massed in two main areas. One was near the present docks to the east of Lion Hill and just south of the Yangtze River Bridge. These were the subsidiary docks, however, and the main docks were located on the river to the west of modern Hanzhongmen Road. The main road from the docks followed a man-made channel for the Qinhuai river dug in the 1370s and passed through the outwall somewhere near modern Jiangdong North Road. This is where the main tax office was located and there were a series of markets found here as well. This area was also notorious as a pleasure district and was crowded with brothels. It then ran along Shuiximen Road into the city through the Sanshan Gate. Outside the walls the road was bordered on the north and south by a series of lakes. Of these only Mochou Lake has not been filled up.   It is hard to find information on the location of other pre-Taiping buildings, but it is known that a temple of the God of Literature was located on Jiangbai Street somewhere in the vicinity of Zhenghe Park. The Confucian Temple (called Fuzimiao, to distinguish it from other Confucian temples) was originally the site of the state-sponsored academy for the Nanjing area, fed into the national universities in Beijing and in Nanjing, itself. To the east of this was the Jiangnan Examination Scholl which served as the site of the highest level of imperial examinations during the reigns of the first three Ming emperors, but which held lower-level examinations after the transfer of the capital to Beijing. The school was one of the largest examination sites in China and had over 20,000 cloisters for those sitting for the exams at one point. These were all torn down during the first two decades of the 20th century to make room for the market stalls that now crowd the area.   Two counties, Jiangning and Shangyuan, had their yamen offices inside Nanjings walls along with the yamen for Yingtian prefecture. The first two were located in the block bordered by Zhonghau Road, Shengzhou Road and Zhongshan South Road, and near the corner of Hongwu Road and Baixia Road. The latter was located on Zhongshan South Road just across from Nanjing 1st Middle School. In addition, the city itself was divided into five wards (East, West, South, North & Central) with offices inside the wall just east of Guanghuamen, just outside Shuiximen, south of Zhonghuamen, north of the Drum Tower, and across Hongwu Road from the Shangyun County yamen. Major markets were set up by the first Ming emperor just inside Tungjimen, just west of Xinqiao, and near Wangfuyuan.   In 1853, the city was captured by Hong Xiuquan and became the capital of his Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. Hong built a huge palace complex, complete with a Temple of Heaven on the site of the Qing Viceroys offices. In addition, Hong built palaces for many of his important followers. These were built at Zhanyuan (for the family of Xiao Chaogui), at Chaotian Palace (for Yang Xiuqing), near Fuzimaio (for the family of Feng Yunshan), near the intersections of modern Baixia and Jiankang Roads (for Wei Changhui), and just north of the Drum Tower (for Shi Dakai). Most of this building and much of the building that predated it was destroyed in a three-day fire that was set when Qing troops recaptured the city in 1864. The city was so devastated that it took decades to recover. For example, even though the city was opened up to foreign trade by the treaties following the two Opium Wars, trade did not actually start until 1899.   When foreigners began moving into Nanjing in the late 1890s they were given a foreign concession inside the walls in an area that had been mostly farmland prior to this. The European style buildings built as the homes of foreign merchants and for foreign legations can still be seen in the area north of Beijing West Road and to the east of the Jiangsu Provincial Offices. In 1911 Dr. Sun Yat-sen led the revolution that overthrew the Qing dynasty and a new government was established in the newly re-re-named city of Nanjing. The offices of this provisional government were set up on the site of the Taiping Palace. In 1912, the first president, Yuan Shikai, moved the capital back to Beijing. In 1928 when the Nationalist Party took control of the government, they proceeded to move the capital back to Nanjing. It was during this period that the Presidential Palace on Jianggang Road was built (atop the site where Hong Xiuquans residence had once stood).   The Japanese captured Nanjing in 1937 in a bloody takeover known as the ""Nanjing Massacre"" or the ""Rape of Nanjing"". Several 100,000 Chinese were slaughtered in the taking of the city and its aftermath. From 1946 to 1949 it was once again the capital of the Republic of China. When Chairman Mao proclaimed the Peoples Republic of China on October 1st, 1949 the capital moved once more back to Beijing. Nanjing suffered a great deal from the Cultural Revolution when many of its historical relics were damaged or destroyed and many of its leading intellectuals were sent to the countryside for ""reeducation"".

Like most manors it seems to have changed hands several times over the centuries, passing to Thomas Corbett of Legh in 1420 and purchased by a family called the Keytes from Gloucestershire, who held it in the early 1600s.   The census of 1801 records that the village had a population of 45 families, or 220 people, mostly employed in agriculture. In 1803 about 740 acres in the parish was enclosed by Pemdock Neale, the lord of the manor, leaving a proportion to the rector, Thomas Neale equal to the value of his uninclosed glebe and right of common. In 1810 the manor of Sibson with 880 acres of freehold enclosed land and the advowson of the rectory, a newly-erected rectory-house, coach-house, stables, and yards, altogether worth about a thousand pounds was again offered for sale.

It is famous for its Easter festival which lasts for five days and attracts a large number of pilgrims. A special feature of the festival is the nighty procession of ten images in festival cars with pyrotechnic honors. A passion play is also performed on the night of Good Friday in the open space in front of the church. Behind the church is a tomb surmounted by a Mantapam. The earth beneath the floor of the mantapam is eaten as medicine by all castes as an infallible specific against gastric pains and a considerable hole has been excavated by persons so afflicted.

The Tokyo High Court made the first decision to grant a patent for a selection invention in the field of chemical compounds about four decades ago. After that, many people published studies on the ground of patentability of the selection invention, and the Court examined many cases with relation to their inventions, but many decisions were adverse to the applicant s interests. Are there any difficult problems as to proof of whether a claimed invention constitutes a selection invention before the Court? In the case where there exists an invention which expresses in a generic concept all or one part of its constituent features in a prior art invention, an invention which is expressed in more specific concepts than covered by that generic concept and has a limitation which is not disclosed in the prior art invention but contains selected constituent features necessary for specifying the invention, such an invention is widely recognized to be a selection invention. And the selection invention is patentable as an independent and distinct invention from the prior art invention, in the case where there exists an advantageous effect different in the kind of an effect provided by the prior art invention or a conspicuously superior effect (but this is an effect of the same quality provided by the prior art invention) to that provided by the prior art invention. The patentability of the selection invention depends on the problem of whether this invention is identical with the prior art invention (identicalness), and also of whether this invention involves an inventive step when compared with the prior art invention. The cases in Japan where the claimed invention is an invention described in a prior art publication, are divided into the following categories: (a) The claimed invention is the same invention as the prior art invention described in the publication. (b) The claimed invention is described in the publication. (c) The claimed invention is not distinguished from the prior art invention described in the publication. (d) The claimed invention does not constitute a distinct invention from the prior art invention described in the publication. In case (a), both inventions have the same object, construction and effect of the invention. In case (b), both inventions have the same construction of the invention, but a different object and effect of the invention. If the claimed invention has the same constituent features as the prior art invention, other factors ie the object and effect of the invention are excluded from consideration. In order to avoid case (b), the claimed invention has to be changed into a use invention. In case (c), an applicant cannot amend the definition or scope of the invention apart from a written specification in order to establish another invention different from the prior art invention. In case (d), the problem of whether the claimed invention constitutes a distinct invention from the prior art invention will be discussed; that is, the central problem of the selection invention. Recently, the Court made a decision which denied the constitution of a selection invention (1995 (gyo ke) No.218 // December 10 1997). This case relates to a liquid fabric softening composition comprising: (1) an aqueous base; (2) cationic fabric softening agent (ingredient A); (3) fatty acid (ingredient B); and (4) a non-ionic surfactant (ingredient C), wherein the mole ratio of A to C is within a specific range. On the other hand, the prior art invention relates to a fabric softening composition comprising: (1) an aqueous base; (2) A; and (3) B. This cited invention discloses the addition and the amount of C as one of the well-known adjuvants in the specification, but does not exhibit an example adding C. In this decision, the Court stated that all constituent features which were substantially described in the cited specification if not constituting the selection invention, and if not described, there thus existed no conspicuously superior effect within the specific range of the mole ratio of A to C when compared with the effect beyond this range. Summary The problem of whether the claimed invention constitutes a selection invention depends on the disclosure of the invention including the superior effect in the written specification, and the applicant is to note that the claimed invention is an invention described in the prior art publication.

The incident happened in 1944 during the Soviet Summer Offensive 1944 in  Ilomantsi . The infantry regiment where private Emil Hytti belonged, had been badly mauled in combat, retreated for days and the morale was universally low. The regimental commander, colonel S.O. Lindgren, who was known as an impetuous and trigger-happy soldier, then attempted to organize the men into counter-attack. As the men disobeyed, Col. Lindgren shot the nearest man, private Emil Hytti, who died immediately. He was married, and father of nine children. No investigation or examination was later made, as the Finnish Military Criminal Act allowed the officers and NCOs to shoot any disobedient subordinates without consequences.   The widow of Pvt. Hytti was denied any compensations or pensions, because his husband was not killed in action but shot by his superior. His nine orphaned children neither ever received any compensation or welfare.   The incident appears in litterature as a scene in  Vin Linna 's  The Unknown Soldier , where Lieutenant Colonel Karjula shoots private Viiril from disobeying his orders.   Colonel Lindgren became later dubiously famous for forcing people who had trespassed his lands, to strip down their pants and march on the road halw-naked while he toted them with a shotgun and yelled insults on them. One of them was the Olympic shooter Pentti Linnosvuo.

This function is implemented in the mainboard BIOS or in the driver software of the hard disk controller. Enabling the function produces a change in the operating mode of the servo controller of the read-write head. This causes the head to be placed in motion and decelerated softer than previously.

The knee is the part of the leg involving the most complex biomechanics; as this is intact for all transtibial amputees, the process of mimicking native leg movement becomes much easier for this population.     [ edit ]   History   Prior to the 1980s, foot prostheses merely restored basic walking capabilities. These early devices can be characterized by a simple artificial attachment connecting ones residual limb to the ground.   The introduction of the Seattle Foot (Seattle Limb Systems) in 1981 revolutionized the field, bringing the concept of an Energy Storing Prosthetic Foot (ESPF) to the fore. Other companies soon followed suit, and before long, there were multiple models of energy storing prostheses on the market. Each model utilized some variation of a compressible heel. The heel is compressed during initial ground contact, storing energy which is then returned during the latter phase of ground contact to help propel the body forward.   Since then, the foot prosthetics industry has been dominated by steady, small improvements in performance, comfort, and marketability.     [ edit ]   Design Considerations   There are multiple factors to consider when designing a transtibial prosthesis. Manufacturers must make choices about their priorities regarding these factors.   Performance   Nonetheless, there are certain elements of foot mechanics that are invaluable for the athlete, and these are the focus of todays high-tech prosthetics companies:         Energy storage and return  storage of energy acquired through ground contact and utilization of that stored energy for propulsion               Energy absorption  minimizing the effect of high impact on the musculoskeletal system               Ground compliance  stability independent of terrain type and angle               Rotation  ease of changing direction               Weight  maximizing comfort, balance and speed         Other   The buyer is also concerned with numerous other factors:         Cosmetics               Cost               Ease of use               Size availability           [ edit ]   Emerging Technology   Most companies choose to focus on two areas of performance: energy capabilities and ground compliance. Two particular models exemplify the innovation in these areas: the Elite foot (Endolite) and the Venture foot (College Park Industries).   The Elite foot relies on a polymeric material with a very specific set of elasticity and resistance requirements in order to optimize energy storage and return. It also uses an unprecedented three-pronged foot, which allegedly allows the foot to closely mold to the contours of any surface.   In contrast, the Venture foot retains the common one-point contact with the ground, but seeks to maximize performance (in both energy and compliance) with a complex metal heel component. This heel is equipped not just with a standard compressible foam piece, but also hinges which allow rotation on three different axes, allegedly yielding superior comfort (ground compliance) and a more precise mimicry of native foot biomechanics (energy capabilities).   Many other foot prostheses employ other useful innovative technology and designs. No one foot is perfect for all transtibial amputees.

[ edit ]   Transtibial Prostheses   Transtibial amputees have the greatest hope of regaining normal mobility. The knee is the part of the leg involving the most complex biomechanics; as this is intact for all transtibial amputees, the process of mimicking native leg movement becomes much easier for this population.     [ edit ]   History   Prior to the 1980s, foot prostheses merely restored basic walking capabilities. These early devices can be characterized by a simple artificial attachment connecting ones residual limb to the ground.   The introduction of the Seattle Foot (Seattle Limb Systems) in 1981 revolutionized the field, bringing the concept of an Energy Storing Prosthetic Foot (ESPF) to the fore. Other companies soon followed suit, and before long, there were multiple models of energy storing prostheses on the market. Each model utilized some variation of a compressible heel. The heel is compressed during initial ground contact, storing energy which is then returned during the latter phase of ground contact to help propel the body forward.   Since then, the foot prosthetics industry has been dominated by steady, small improvements in performance, comfort, and marketability.     [ edit ]   Design Considerations   There are multiple factors to consider when designing a transtibial prosthesis. Manufacturers must make choices about their priorities regarding these factors.   Performance   Nonetheless, there are certain elements of foot mechanics that are invaluable for the athlete, and these are the focus of todays high-tech prosthetics companies:         Energy storage and return  storage of energy acquired through ground contact and utilization of that stored energy for propulsion               Energy absorption  minimizing the effect of high impact on the musculoskeletal system               Ground compliance  stability independent of terrain type and angle               Rotation  ease of changing direction               Weight  maximizing comfort, balance and speed         Other   The buyer is also concerned with numerous other factors:         Cosmetics               Cost               Ease of use               Size availability           [ edit ]   Emerging Technology   Most companies choose to focus on two areas of performance: energy capabilities and ground compliance. Two particular models exemplify the innovation in these areas: the Elite foot (Endolite) and the Venture foot (College Park Industries).   The Elite foot relies on a polymeric material with a very specific set of elasticity and resistance requirements in order to optimize energy storage and return. It also uses an unprecedented three-pronged foot, which allegedly allows the foot to closely mold to the contours of any surface.   In contrast, the Venture foot retains the common one-point contact with the ground, but seeks to maximize performance (in both energy and compliance) with a complex metal heel component. This heel is equipped not just with a standard compressible foam piece, but also hinges which allow rotation on three different axes, allegedly yielding superior comfort (ground compliance) and a more precise mimicry of native foot biomechanics (energy capabilities).   Many other foot prostheses employ other useful innovative technology and designs. No one foot is perfect for all transtibial amputees. Hopefully, however, each amputee can find a foot that is best for his or her particular pattern of physical activity.       [ edit ]   Sources     Gailey, Robert. The Biomechanics of Amputee Running.

John Miller claims to receive  telepathic impressions  from the  spirit world  to create  healing instruments  that donators receive as  gifts  for set donation prices varying from hundreds to thousands of dollars.   In May 2004 GWP leaders filed a lawsuit in Maine U.S. District Court, consisting of Federal RICO (racketeering) and Lanham claims, plus state claims such as defamation, against several international anti-cult educators and two former followers who published stories on the Internet about their personal experiences with GWP during seventeen years as followers and board members.   The former members won their  Motion for Summary Judgment  in January 2006, resulting in dismissal of GWP's Federal claims and remaining state claims by  Senior District Judge Gene Carter . In January 2006 GWP leaders refiled their lawsuit in Maine State Court (York County, Alfred, ME), consisting of the remaining state claims, against the two former members and one anti-cult educator from New Zealand.

Cookies are more easily performed on wet surfaces and also in the snow. When performed in the snow it is more often done to have fun than it is to make an earnest attempt at creating the circular skid mark pattern.

Standard car A standard car can be one comercially available or a champion event car that has no ""auto pilot"" controls as such unlike specialised cookie cars. With a standard car you cant do much more as you need access to the accelerator pedal to perform the stunt. One such stunt could be to roll down the drivers window and sit on the door frame with your body and one arm and leg outside and the other arm and foot on the accelerator and steering wheel. As the gear stick and clutch pedal are out of reach the car would need to be moving before the stunt. Once ready the throttle is pumped to initiate and keep the car rotating at the correct speed, for added effect waving to the spectators. For left hand drives it goes anti clockwise and right hand drives clockwise this ensures that the centrifugal force throw the driver toward the car rather than away. Occaisionally drivers open the door and holding on to the roof and door frame, this carries a higher risk.   Specialised car A specialised car is usually a champion event car that has been given a type of auto pilot control that locks the steering wheel and throttle allowing the driver to perform more daring but also more dangerous cookies. To iniate the cookie is the same but once achieved the steering is held in place and the throttle is locked at the maxinmum allowing the driver to release the controls letting the car carry on by itself. Some things that could be done is the driver opens both doors and climbs out one side across the roof and in the other. This is very dangerous as the only hand holds are either side of the roof (which is a fair distance to reach) and the sudden change in direction of the centrifugal forces could catch out an unprepaired driver and throw them off the car.

Although his only appearance is in  Sharpe's Siege , he played a vital role in Sharpe's adventure during that time.   There is not a great deal of private information known of him. What we do know of him is that he is an American who comes from Marblehead, Massachusetts, and that he masters a New England schooner called the  Thuella  (her name meaning 'stormcloud' in Greek). He is described to be younger than Sharpe (who is around 38 at this time), so he is probably in his very early thirties or so. The first description of him we see is once he appears in front of Ducos after having caused the Royal Navy some grievances at St. Jean de Luz. The description is as follows:   ""He had a cutwater of a face; sharp, lined, savagely tanned; a dangerously handsome face framed by a tangled shock of gold-dark hair. It was battered, beaten by winds and seas and scarred by blades and scorched by powder-blasts, but still a handsome face; enough to make the girls look twice.""   Back home, people know him to be a 'reckless rogue' who simply has one consecutive adventure after another.   He appears to be known quite well amongst the Royal Navy as Horace Bampfylde expressed particular delight in speculating what he would do with Killick once he had caught him: his view of Killick is that of an ignorant barbarian who is no more than a 'common and vulgar pirate', although this is a contrast with how other people such as Frederickson, Harper and Sharpe himself all seem to be impressed with Killick's mastery at the helm, as he is demonstrated with a simple  chasse mare  dancing scorn about the Navy at the St. Jean de Luz port in the first chapter or so.   The novel suggests that the Commandant of the Teste de Buch fort, Henri Lassan, and Cornelius Killick have had a friendship of some sorts for at least a while as they seem quite familiar with each other. This is suggested at various intervals such as Lassan commenting that he prays for Killick's soul and Killick yelling at Sharpe near the end during the escape for him not to kill Lassan. Killick also makes numerous visits to the fort and even volunteers to fight against the Riflemen/Marine group coming from the South in order to drive them from the Teste de Buch fort. Once Lassan agreed, he put the plan forward to his crew and said that any of them could simply not participate at all if they didn't want to, but such was their faith in their captain and such was their liking for him, that the majority of them remained to fight with him.   Unfortunately, during that time, he underestimated the Riflemen and he and his men lost the battle, albeit with no bloodshed, due to his uncertainty of how to act in land-based warfare. They were then captured and taken back to the Teste de Buch fort- now under British control- to be hung. During this time, Killick and his Lieutenant, Liam Docherty, were treated brutally by Horace Bampfylde in an interrogation session after they were asked whether there were any Royal Navy deserters amongst them. This came as much of a shock to Frederickson as he had promised the Americans good treatment.   After talking with Sharpe, however, the English Major agreed to release them without Bampfylde's agreement after Killick told him a (false) folk story stating that if one hangs a sailorman in still airs, his soul will come back and take another for revenge. Sharpe, worried about the health and safety of his current wife, Jane, submits to it.   This came to be a pivotal decision though, as Killick proves to be Sharpe's only hope of escape during the assault on the Teste de Buch.   After their release, Killick, deteremined to keep the  Thuella  out of British interest so as they would not attempt to capture it, managed to fool them into thinking that his beloved ship was 'a ruined hulk' lying in the tides of the shores near the village of Gujan, with no prizes or riches to be found amongst it. During this time, however, he was also turned it into a floating battery, a fortress on land with all their guns facing out to sea in case a British ship did try and take it. His plan worked and Bampfylde decided to leave it there.   After a series of events due to Ducos' trickery, Sharpe finds himself and his men (50 troops altogether) stranded in the Fort, alone, without any assistance from the Navy and soon to be facing an onslaught over over 2,000 French troops led by Gerneral Calvet. It is during the prelude of the attack, that Killick pays a visit to Sharpe and talks to him, in a somewhat offhand way, about releasing Killick of his oath (one he had taken in order for Sharpe to truly release the Americans: it stated that he would never fight the British again), about Sharpe's predicament, and (somewhat randomly) about oysters. It was evident there that there was some light banter exchanged between the two at this time; this is possibly due to Frederickson's earlier statement that he thought the two were alike in many ways.   Finally, Killick's role in this book is most evident in the last few chapters. Ducos, having blackmailed him into taking part in the assault against the British-held Teste de Buch, orders him to fire at the enemy until they surrender. Though unknown to him, Sharpe goes to see Killick after this and makes 'the devil's pact' by relinquishing Killick's burdensome oath and instead taking on one of his own, to never fight the Americans, in order to have Killick rescue his men from the fort.   Thus the battle played out. The  Thuella , towed by two longboats due to lack of wind, was rowed down in line to the Teste de Buch fort, where they did indeed fire. It was a mere three rounds until the ememy surrendered: albeit to the United States of America and not the French. Thus Killick took the fort, though the French, infuriated, attacked anyway. It became a battle for survival as the British raced to the long boats to the  Thuella  with the French cavalry chasing them along the beach. With miraculously few casualties to show for this, Sharpe and most of his men made it aboard the  Thuella , thus escaping a seemingly impossible situation.   After this, Killick and Sharpe drunk brandy in his cabin, Killick inviting Sharpe to Marblehead to drink more when this war was over. He dropped the English off not far from St. Jean de Luz, as close as he could get without running into trouble with the Navy. He also recruited one of the Rifleman, Thomas Taylor (an American), to take him back to America presumably on his request. The last we see mention of him in Sharpe's Siege is him sailing westwards towards America.   He is mentioned a bit in the next book, Sharpe's Revenge, though only fleetingly by Sharpe and Bampfylde concerning the confusion about the supposed whereabouts of 'the Emperor's Gold', which Bampfylde suspects that Sharpe and Killick split between themselves, even though no such event occured. This is what Sharpe's Revenge deals with.   Trivia   -A commonly-heard and frequently-used phrase is 'Bugger me'.   -He seems to be fond of both brandy and women.   -He smokes cigars (a lot), and seems to be at a loss without them.   -He lost a tooth during the beating Bampfylde's men gave him.   -He likes raw oysters.   -An insult that hits him particularly sharply is to mention him as a future traitor to the American people, such as being compared to  Benedict Arnold .

As of 2006, the country of Ryanville had a population of 680,768. Ryanville is on the Lower  Chickasaw Bluff  above the  Mississippi River , at the mouth of the  Wolf River .     [ edit ]   Information   Ryanville is a self-governing  city-state  with a  totalitarian  government run by the tree Overlord Ryan Hebert. It should run under  Central time , but Ryan Hebert has imposed his own  Ryan time zone  to be used in the city. Ryan time can be found by adding 6 minutes to  Pacific time : therefore, when it is 12:00 AM in Central time, it is 10:06 AM in Ryan time. Ryanville does not observe  daylight savings time . The Ryanville national anthem is called ""This is Ryanville!"", and was composed by  Industrial Ghetto Metal  on Ryan's orders.     [ edit ]   Declaration of Independence   Ryanville's independence from the United States was declared on May 12th, 2006, during a fire drill at Episcopal High School. The drill was staged by Ryan's cloud father so he could transport him to Memphis to complete his third task. Ryan promptly extended his roots and unleashed his powerful  branch attack  on the citizens of the city, demanding that they surrender the area to him immediatly. Initially, there was some resistance, as two firemen and a giraffe attacked Ryan in a desperate attempt to stop him from seizing the city. Ryan merely turned his ass and farted in their faces, killing them instantly with the deadly toxic nerve gases contained in the fart. Ryan's father then build a palace of  pie floaters  for Ryan to command his new country from.     [ edit ]   Foreign Relations   The nation of Ryanville is, in fact, the ground-based branch of the much larger  United Overlord Sky Nation (UOSN) . Therefore, it has extremely good relations with that country. It has excellent relations with  New Zealand , having delivered 43,000 truckloads of  Mountain Dew  to the country in exchange for more pie floaters for Ryan's palace. It is also on good terms with  Iceland , due to Ryan's mother's extramarital affair with that country's landmass. However, Ryanville has made enemies of every other country on the planet, except for  Canada , who released the official press statement, ""We honestly don't give a fuck what's going on anywhere in the world, as long as it stays out of this country."" a mere five milliseconds after Ryanville was founded.

The Orpheum Theater is to perform  traditional Overlord tree porn  every Thursday evening.   2. Everyone must head-bang to the national anthem, or they will be exposed to the wrath of Ryan's  tidal wave attack .   3. All citizens must run, catch, and throw like pussies.   4. All citizens must wear shirts that say ""We love Ryan, he's so k00l!"" on Fridays.     68.105.157.197  22:15, 12 May 2006 (UTC)     [ edit ]   Cuarteto Latinoamericano   El Cuarteto Latinoamericano, fundado en Mxico en 1981, representa hoy una voz nica en el mbito internacional, difundiendo la creacin musical de Amrica Latina en los principales centros musicales del mundo.

Because these generators provide a full-scale range to seconds, coarser resolution of ns, us and ms are achievable since digital delay generators have many digits of time control.   Early digital delay generators provided a single channel of delay. This was sufficient for applications such as optical fiber dispersion testing and testing of radar and lidar systems. Later applications required more channels of synchronized timing and multi-channel delay generators became the standard.   Recent designs now provide the capabilities of both digital delay and pulse generators. Earlier digital delay generators provided mere edges that triggered devices or electronics while pulse generators provided both delay and width control without the fine time resolution. Current digital delay generators provide multiple channels each with delay and width control and the fine resolution. Each channel may also have pulse polarities and amplitude levels that are independent of the others.   Digital delay generator designs have migrated from discrete, analog designs using ramps, start-up oscillators to largely integrated, digital designs using FPGA's and ASIC's. The latter method allows the DDG to have more funtionality such as selectable reference's, combining timing to create more complex waveforms and having independent channel timing properties. For example, one channel may output a pulse with each trigger, another may output a burst of pulses, yet another may output a pulse for every N triggers. Gating the output of specific channels or of the entire delay generator is also achievable with newer designs.

He is the emperor of  Ryanville  and the Vice Vice Vice Lower Chairman of the Lower Board on the  Overlord Council .     [ edit ]   Birth and Early Life   Ryan Hebert was born in  Pangaea , sometime around 10000 B.C. to parents  Choo-choo-peekee Hebert  and  Mother Nature . As a very young child, he moved to  Venus  for a short time with his father. They returned to Earth in  1945 , the year of the fall of  Adolf Hitler . He served in the  Bulgarian armed forces  until  1982  as a tire-changer. In  1982  his parents seperated, and his father gained custody. They moved to  Memphis , but after only one human second, Ryan's father got sick of him and he dumped Ryan in  Baton Rouge . This served two purposes: Ryan's father hoped that Ryan would return home as a fully-sprouted tree Overlord, and he was simply tired of dealing with the little shit.     [ edit ]   Commencement of the Tasks   In the year  2005 , Ryan's dad began to realize that his son would never become an Overlord without some assistance. Choo-choo, however, did not wish to spend anymore energy on his child, so he sent two hurricanes ( Katrina  and  Rita ) to destroy his son, both of which missed due to the fact that his meek little pea of a son was too small a target. Finally, a year later, Ryan's dad gave in, and arranged for Ryan's class to take a field trip to Memphis. There, he discreetly sent instructions to Ryan through his friends  Tim Donald-Davis ,  Justin Ross , and  Stewart Tassin . It took Ryan's unusually small brain a little while to comprehend what he was being told, but eventually he caught on and began his tasks.     [ edit ]   The First Two Tasks   Ryan's first task was to successfully eat the entirety of his  chicken caesar salad , which he failed to complete due to the fact that some of his food went flying in the wind (which his father made on purpose to challenge him). As a replacement task, Ryan had to successfully toe into the waters of the  Mud Island  museum, which he completed, with some difficulty. His second task was completed just a few days later, when he succeeded in pulling down a mesh window cover on the busride home to  Baton Rouge .     [ edit ]   The Third Task   Ryan soon became disillusioned with the idea of becoming an Overlord, which greatly angered his father. Time after time, Choo-choo sent Ryan tasks, and Ryan ignored them completely. His father started to realize that Ryan was not meant to be the Overlord of Earth (as was planned for him); that the best he could do was rule a city. And then it struck him. Choo-choo planned to make Ryan's third task to defeat the city of  Tokyo  with nothing but a basket of  oranges . But Ryan ignored this task as well. Ryan's father had to give him an even more insignificant city to conquer, so he decided on Memphis. It took about a month to finally convince Ryan to get up off his lazy ass and go finish his third task, but Ryan finally completed it on May 12th, 2006. He was made a full Overlord (much to the dismay of his superiors) and became emperor of his new country Ryanville.     [ edit ]   Private Life   In his spare time, Ryan enjoys playing with his  Nintendo DS  games, especially the Polly Pocket series, and throwing frisbees like a total pussy. He also enjoys listening to techno remixes of  'N SYNC  songs.     68.105.157.197  22:44, 12 May 2006 (UTC)     [ edit ]   Jerry Ong   Jerry Ong - A Malaysia Pioneer Moblogger, using his Nokia model 6680 moblog about his daily life & stories.

Founded in 1997, DeepThinka Records' main objective from day one has been to differentiate itself among the overabundance of indie-labels by redefining what a hip hop record label is and can be. This redefinition effort is made possible in part by providing an environment conducive to artistic expression, minus business and politics. DeepThinka aims to bring the artist and their sound to the forefront, placing emphasis on the music rather than the business. DeepThinka's entire staff is composed of hip hop artists themselves, from the president to the promotion coordinator to the radio servicing director; we're all hip hop, we all place good music before all else. Over the years DeepThinka has dedicated itself to expressive artistic revolution, classic wordplay, skillful and innovative hip hop, industry revolt and reform, political/social development, and mental awareness and consciousness.      DeepThinka: A History   1999/2000: DeepThinka first got on the map with O.R.I.O.N., a 12-track compilation from a collective known as the Immortal Micunion. The highly acclaimed CD came in an era known for sub par musical output and focused on awakening ourselves and our culture from the deep creative slumber we had fallen into. Following that was a 2000 release from the Cleveland duo Rime Royal, entitled Illa Godz. The CD expanded on O.R.I.O.N. and solidified metaphors and rhyme skills as the tools of the trade.   2002: After taking a year to assess the industry landscape and organize its efforts, DeepThinka came back in 2002 with four groundbreaking records in one year. First, the Immortal Micunion-showing no signs of a sophomore slump-released A Declaration of Independents, a scathing 20 track album and accompanying 12"" that tore into the record industry and challenged the current social structure. Then the Cinemaddicts surfaced, combining jazz, funk, poetry, filthy graffiti mindsets and Dosteyevsky into an album entitled Notes from the Underground. Notes brought us back to the early nineties hip hop, and this trip back in time gave way to a rebirth of hip hop, moving it forward and bridging the renaissance of 1991-94 with the current day. In July, longtime DTR fixture Rime Royal dropped the Royalties EP in limited release, and the only problem was that the demand exceeded supply. Finally, October saw Edotkom bring a whole new dynamic to DTR's discography. Their debut album Obsidian represented a dark and introspective look into the group themselves, as well as the hip hop landscape. The CD marked a next level of sorts for DTR, continues to receive acclaim throughout the industry, and is setting a new standard for all artists to follow.   2003: Started in typical DTR fashion, with two innovative new redefinitions of what hip hop is and can be. First, Brooklyn emcee Loki da Trixta cutting through the chicanery and falsehood of modern day hip hop with his debut LP, Mythology - a blend of quirky jazz, feel good humor, social statements, and clever historical references. Followed by Rime Royal's Furious dropping Beats to the Rime Vol. 1, a compilation of emcees repping 216, 716, and 718; all bringing diverse styles together over Furious' new breed of production. The year was capped off by X-Now's Boy Meets World EP; a superb collection of tracks from the Buffalo emcee featuring an all-star lineup of beats from T1X, General Spade, Tone @las, and Furious1. Among the tracks was the previously unreleased ""Incident at 6/14/02"", an T1X produced anti-police posse cut--actually recorded the morning after a melee involving the BPD and cast of emcees who blessed the track: X-Now, Ajent O, Rime Royal, Pseudo, Intricate, and Loki da Trixta.   2004: Kicked off but the much delayed and highly anticipated debut from Cleveland quartet Spittin Image, entitled Broken Mirrors. A grimey, intimate portrait of life, the album's production is handled mostly by groupmember Fitty, but also finds supporting beats from T1X & Furious, Krossword, and Rough Draft. Spittin Image worked the entire 2003 to get the record ready, and it did not disapoint--winning Hip Hop Album of the Year in Cleveland. Additionally, just weeks before departing on a bicycle tour from Buffalo NY to Pine Ridge, SD (an on to Denver, CO) DJ Cutler dropped Lettuce Arise, one of the most prolific mixtapes of the last ten years, featuring classic renditions of Dead Prez/Bob Marley's ""Hip Hop/Jammin"" and Thelonius Monk's ""Little Rooti Tootie"". Rounding out the year was the Victims of Reality EP from former Spittin Image alum Analog, mixtapes from Rhyson Hall - The Sleeper, Vol's 1 + 2, Gr& Phee - Hiezmen: Stone City, and the debut 12"" from Siege Heart of the Game b/w Cyanide.   2005: DTR's most chaotic, and yet most progressive year to date. Expansion has sprouted a brand new movement of dedication and artistic integrity. Mix CD's were the key component early in the year with offerings from Gr& Phee (Attack of The Fly Snuka), X-Now (On My Way To School), and DJ Cutler (Idle Records and Empty Growlers). Following this came the long delayed debut of Rhyson Hall, in the form of a 12"" single entitled ""STILL RAW"", which ended the year #6 on college radio charts throughout the US and Canada. All to be followed up with Mr. Hall's collaborative CD release with Gr& Phee, ""Detained at the Border"" in 2006. Be on the lookout!   Looking ahead, DeepThinka Records has reorganized its collective in preparation for the highly anticipated, REBEL RADIO II. New heads are on board, some of the familiar faces have departed, yet DTR still plans to change the way it all works. The team is organized, the masses are awakening, the world is challenging old thought, and DeepThinka is coming to the front lines. The entire roster is developing new ways to exist as a unique label, news ways to push creativity and innovation even further, new ways to redefine the record industry, and-most of all-new ways to bring dope hip hop to ears and minds everywhere.

If the assignment statement is used to copy the value of an object represented by a large data structure (e.g., a list or tree object), it is inefficient. If the assignment statement is used to copy a reference to a non-trivial object, instead, it creates an  alias ; aliasing makes it difficult to reason about program behavior. A swap statement differs from an  assignment  statement in that it is both fast and avoids aliasing. This is because the swap statement, when implemented properly, exchanges references to participating objects in constant time, leaving objects with unique references if they start with unique references.   The swap statement is especially useful for inserting and removing objects of a generic type from a collection object, without having to copy values or references. However, when a swap statement is used to insert, for example, callers must be aware that they no longer have access to an inserted object unless they first remove it explicitly.   Resolve, an imperative language used in research and designed to build verifiable software, uses swap statements instead of assignments. Tako is a compiler for CleanJava that enhances Java with a swap statement. C++ standard template library classes include a swap method.

[ edit ]   Maktab Sultan Abu Bakar   Maktab Sultan Abu Bakar, which is also known as English College(EC) is a premier school located in the southernmost state of Malaysia, Johor. It is located in the bustling city of Johor Bahru and caters for students studying in the secondary level of education in Malaysia.   English College was set up on the 21st of March, 1914. Its initial enrolment comprised 21 selected students from the Bukit Zahrah School. The first site of EC was in the area of the Sungai Chat palace. The students were to study under the tutelage of two European teachers namely Mr. Morrison and Mr. Holman. These 21 students were the pioneers of EC and they formed the nucleus of the present English College or Maktab Sultan Abu Bakar. Today, things are very much different, from the increasing number of students, to its expanding facilities and to its stature of being one of Malaysia's premier schools.   From the humble beginnings of the college, Maktab Sultan Abu Bakar has transformed itself into a college that is renowned not only in academia, sports but a variety of other areas, be it interstate or nationally. Many of its graduates go on to become national leaders, successful entrepreneurs and national athletes that not only do the college proud, but also the Malaysian nation.

Made from two steel pressings welded together and fitted with a non-return valve, Jackpots are an economical way of achieving ""active"" support underground at the time of installation - with pre-loads on the mine props of 15 - 60 tons. Invented in 1997 they are manufactured New Concept Mining in South Africa and are now used around the world to support the roof in underground mining operations.   The immediate roof support provided by Jackpots greatly reduces the chances of rock falls - the single biggest cause of fatal accidents in underground mining. Jackpots have a number of patented features which improve their performance - the ""roll-over"" design is very flexible and accomodates uneven rock and timber geometry. Newly introduced is a dual-purpose filling valve with an integrated pressure release valve. The PRV provides for controlled yielding of the mine prop at a set load thus preventing catastropic failure of the prop due to closure of the excavation.   http://free.financialmail.co.za/innovations/3dec/kinn.htm   http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/mining/pubs/pdfs/hpuai.pdf   http://www.ncm.co.za     81.129.46.222  08:14, 13 May 2006 (UTC)     [ edit ]   Stormhornet   Storm hornets are facinating creatures they are fast light and there sting is incredibly painful they are very rare and only appear when a storm is brewing, a storm hornet is the creature rook barkwater based his skycraft on.

The object is to obtain a hand with all the same suite as close to 31 as possible. All number cards are worth their face value, picture cards are worth 10 and aces are worth 11. If you get three of a kind it equals 30 1/2. to end a round you must knock one your turn which gives the remainder of the players one more turn. If you have 31 with two face cards and the ace of a suite it is an automatic win or scat and that hand automatically ends. if you obtain 31 with one face card the ten and the ace of that suite you only have 31 and still must knock to end the game.   To begin everyone is delt 3 cards and the rest of the deck is left as a means of picking up cards, the first discard is also flipped by the dealer. Often the game is played for a few dollars based on knocks which is how you end a hand. So if you are the loser of a hand you lose a knock. if you knoock and still loose(have the lowest hand) then you loose two knocks. If someone scats then everyone except the person who scatted loosed one knock. the game continues untill only one person remains with a knock.

According to IMS, an internationally recognized marketing firm, jintropin is the absolute market leader in China with just over 75% market share.   - Lowered blood pressure - Improved cholesterol profile - Supplement stronger bones - Younger, tighter, thicker skin - Hair re growth - Wrinkle removal - Increased muscle mass - Reduced body fat - Higher energy levels - Increased exercise performance - Re-generation of major organs that shrink with age - Greater cardiac output - Superior immune function - Enhanced human sexual performance   JINTROPIN  stimulates linear growth and increases growth rate in children who lack adequate endogenous growth hormone. In adults with growth hormone deficiency, JINTROPIN reduces fat mass, increases muscle mass and improves energy, vitality and subjective well-being. In patients suffering from severe burns, AIDS associated muscle wasting, or undergoing major operations, JINTROPIN promotes wound healing, attenuates the protein-catabolic response and improves whole-body nitrogen economy after operation. Bodybuilders use JINTROPIN because it promotes growth of new muscle cells and uses body's own fat as energy source.   Jintropin  and Lily's  Humatrope  use secretion technology which produces a 191 amino acid sequence growth hormone, with much less E.coli protein contamination and no side effects associated with injection, such as red painful welts. This technology also has the advantage that growth hormone produced using secretion technology is very stable; it remains stable at 37C (98F degrees) for over 30 days (45C degrees for over a week). While growth hormone with 192 amino acid sequence is stable at room temperature for only a few days.

The Enclave as achieved fame and infamy in a large amount of the games they have participated in largely due to their intrepid and at times bombastic behavior. The Enclave has won championships in  Rainbow Six ,  Rogue Spear ,  Team Fortress Classic , and  Planetside .           [ edit ]   Rainbow Six and Rogue Spear   The Enclave was first established in January of 1998 as a Rainbow 6 gaming clan on Mplayer. The Enclave held the title of champions for 2 years in  Rainbow Six  and one in  Rogue Spear . The simplistic style of gameplay and use of tactics of the Rainbow Six Genre appealed to many members of The Enclave.       [ edit ]   Team Fortress Classic   Having completely commandeered the R6 scene and with  Mplayer s sellout to  Gamespy Industries  the Enclave looked towards Team Fortress Classic for their next game. However, The Enclave failed to achieve the instant success they had in Rainbow Six. After a few months the decision was made to join CLQ and start partaking in tournaments. Establishing soon after, SOPs or Standard Operation Procedures for TFC maps such as Well2, NML, CZ2 and others.   The Enclave were responsible in creating several of the most popular maps in TFC tournament history such as the Wstland series (1, 2, 3 and 4) and the ever popular and self titled map ""Enclave"" which was used in nearly every single league after the fall of the CLQ.   The climax for The Enclave in TFC was their victory in the 10v10  CLQ  championship match against ""DNoD"" - the top tier clan from QTF and previous CLQ champions for 99'. This was considered by many to be the most controversial championship of the CLQ in that the clan who won won it was on a map one of their members made. After a 2 year  CLQ  championship reign, many of the members were experiencing severe burn out, many left and were never heard from again and the lost passion to play quickly lead to the Enclave becoming, according to many of its members, a shell of it's former self.       [ edit ]   Planetside   Undoubtedly the Enclave's claim to MMO fame, The Enclave quickly became the most effective yet controversial outfit in all of Emerald/Konried. Its reputation for being a brutally effective yet culturally uncouth group of players spread across multiple communities and their precense lives with the remnants of the planetside player base to this day. The Enclave pioneered and improved upon the most tried and true tactics and strategy on both a global and planetary scale. The Enclave unlike no other outfit was capable of pulling off impressive feats of organization, at its prime its numbers swelled to over 300 and with this they were able to run the most effective combined arms operations in all of PS. Early in 2005, with the advent of BFRs and dwindling interest in the game, the Enclave decided to leave. In little over 1 year The Enclave accumulated 6.9 million outfit points, the highest on its server across all three sides to this day. Beating out outfits with twice as many members and who played for twice as long as The Enclave did.       [ edit ]   World of Warcraft   World of Warcraft  was The Enclaves first experience in MMORPGs. The Enclave played on the server Bleeding Hollow and later Mugthol. The Enclave achieved numerous milestones such as becoming the first guild on #REDIRECT  Bleeding Hollow  with a charter and a tabard, as well as becoming the first guild to have 5, 10, 25, and then 50 level sixty characters. The Enclave focused almost exclusively on PvP. However, one and a half years after World of Warcrafts release date it dawned on The Enclave's members that in order to compete in the games endgame they had to partake in raid instances. The Enclave eventually attempted raid instances but quickly ""burned out"" as it was not what many of its members wanted to do. The Enclave was soon after disbanded as its core membership lost interest in the game.     [ edit ]   Notable Events and Partakings   In December 2003 the  Planetside  server Konreid was merging with its sister server Emerald as a part of the Battle Concentration Initiative. The leaders of each of the three empires staged a meeting on a small plot of land south of Planetside's largest landmass: Cyssor. The meeting was purely ceremonial and was meant as a place for all 3 sides to meet and take screenshots during the final hours of their server. The Enclave being strictly loyalist to the Terran Republic would not have any part in it. So during the climax of the event which was to be a massive screenshot, 3 liberators manned by members of the Enclave flew over the island and decimated everyone on it, thus beginning hostilities between The Enclave and some of the Planetside community.    Late in 2005 a little known planetside player name Raider05 was reported to have died. A massive funeral procession was held for this in game. Former members of The Enclave, as the Planetside phase of The Enclave was officially disbanded, took it upon themselves to bomb the ceremony. The resulting debacle is considered one of the most intense in the history of online gaming. The situation eventually enveloped into the permanent banning and blacklisting of many The Enclave's members from all SoE games.       [ edit ]   The Present and the Future   As of May 2006 the Enclave as an outfit is currently looking towards future MMO's for their next primary game.  Warhammer: The Age of Reckoning  is at the top of the list for its emphasis on PVP and the general appeal of the  Warhammer  universe to many members of The Enclave.

Robert Goddard began the space age in 1926 with the first liquid fuel rocket. As time went by Johannes Winkler began to make ballistic missiles for the German army in 1931. Now, rockets are able to carry loads out of Earths orbit and send satellites to the farthest reaches of the solar system. Obviously, rocket technology has changed greatly over time.   The first rockets were made very long ago and were basically mere arrows or fireworks launched with gunpowder. These primitive rockets were solid fueled. In other words, they were launched with a solid fuel that burns at a constant rate until the fuel runs out. Solid fuel rocket motors may still be found in the booster stages of the space shuttle and in some model rockets. As time progressed scientists realized that solid fuel rockets were not practical if a varied burn rate was needed or if they needed to save fuel for a later burn. Because of this shortcoming, liquid fuel rockets were developed.   Robert Goddard is considered the founder of modern rocket propulsion. This title was given to him for creating the first liquid fuel rocket. After being disgraced by the press in Massachusetts for believing that a rocket with sufficient propulsion could fly through the vacuum of space, Goddard moved away from the cramped east coast to the vast scrubland of New Mexico where people minded their own business and he could work in peace. After long experimentation, he developed rockets that climbed to altitudes of 9,000 feet and broke the speed of sound. He also made designs with fin stabilized steering, multi stages, and gyroscopic guidance systems. Out of all the nations interested in his rocket technology, Germany was the most interested. Occasionally the German government contacted him and he gave casual answers, but when communication fell silent Goddard began to get worried. He began to fear that the German government was planning to use the rockets as missiles to start a war. He took some videos of his rockets to U.S. Army officials in Washington, saying We could slant it a little, and do some damage. By this he meant that if the rockets were used as missiles and aimed at something, they could easily destroy hostile targets. The officials took little interest in the mans comments until the murderous German V-2 rockets began to wreak havoc on London in World War II. After the war, Goddard inspected one of the captured V-2 rockets and found it to be basically the same design as some of his rockets. American scientists then worked alongside German scientists to incorporate Goddard's innovations into the V-2, turning the killer missile into the Redstone, which put the first Americans into space. The Redstone led directly to the Saturn moon rockets, and indirectly to virtually every other rocket the U.S. has ever flown.   Goddards Rocket was fueled with liquid oxygen and gasoline. These were combined in a combustion chamber to make an explosion that was directed through a nozzle. This generated thrust to propel the rocket against the force of gravity. By the time of the Saturn V and the Apollo missions, a different fuel was being used in the same way. This fuel was very similar in that it used liquid oxygen as the oxidizer, but it used kerosene instead of gasoline to create thrust and launch the rocket. Now, with the space shuttle and other modern rockets, liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen are combined to create an explosion to propel the rocket up into space.   After World War II the Cold War began. This was a race of arms. In other words, the United States and the Soviet Union were battling to have the best bombs, missiles, airplanes, and finally, rockets. In the latter part of the Cold War a space race began. This was a race to see which country would have the first person in space, the first docking maneuver, and ultimately the first man on the moon. The first man in space was not an American but rather a Russian cosmonaut named Yuri Gagarin who lifted off in a Vostok spacecraft. He stayed in space for one hour and forty-three minutes before reentering the atmosphere, jumping out of the capsule and parachuting down to earth. After this the U.S. sent Alan Shepard into space aboard a Redstone rocket. This suborbital flight lasted 15 minutes. This led to other flights in Atlas spacecraft such as when John Glenn became the first American to orbit Earth on February 12, 1962. Inside his Friendship 7 spacecraft Glenn circled the globe three times, marveling at the beauty of orbital sunrises and sunsets before sweating through a fiery reentry into Earth's atmosphere.Eventually, the Apollo rockets were developed to carry people to the moon. The first time this was attempted was on Apollo 8 when a crew was sent to the moon. At that point the Lunar Lander had not yet been developed so the astronauts orbited the moon several times before returning to earth. This led to Apollo 11, the mission to allow the first man to walk on the moon. The mission successfully allowed two astronauts, Neal Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin to walk on the moon while the third crew member, Michael Collins, stayed in orbit around the moon controlling the command and service modules so that when the Lunar Lander returned to orbit it could successfully dock and return home. This decisive victory marked the end of the Cold War, but not the end of the space program.   After Apollo 11, ten more men walked on the surface of the moon as part of Apollo missions. No man has been there since. After the Apollo program NASA began to develop a reusable spacecraft to service space stations and do experiments in weightlessness. The result was the space shuttle which could launch vertically like any other rocket and would land like a conventional airplane. The first flight of a space shuttle was made on April 12, 1981 by an orbiter named the Columbia20 years to the day after Yuri Gagarins historic flight  Shuttles flew two to nine missions a year, except in 1986 and 1987 when flights were suspended following the Challenger disaster. Although its cost proved to be much greater and its practical launch frequency much lower than originally anticipated, it did represent a giant leap forward in manned spaceflight capability. To this day the Space Shuttle Program has encompassed 114 launches, spanned 24 years, and deployed, repaired, and harnessed many satellites. The Space Shuttle has accomplished many things and made significant progress in human space exploration. Recent disasters such as the Columbia blowing up on reentry have forced the United States to create a safer, cheaper, and more reliable rocket for space travel.   The projected vehicle that will fulfill these requirements is the Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV). This is a rocket that is reusable for up to ten flights and uses a staged ascent aided by a lower stage made of a solid rocket booster previously used to get the Space Shuttle into orbit. This rocket will be used to launch normally four but possibly six astronauts in the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) to low earth orbit, where it may dock with the International Space Station or another craft such as the heavy lift vehicle. The heavy lift vehicle is boosted into orbit so that it can carry astronauts aboard the CEV to the moon.

The musical electricity in the Nashville studio was crackling that day in 2004 when 13-year-old Whitney Wolanin (pronounced WO-Lan-in) made her recording debut with a powerful and spirited rendition of the Martha and The Vandellas classic ""Heat Wave"" which she nailed brilliantly in one take. Legendary bassist and Motown ""Funk Brother"" Bob Babbitt,  Bob Babbitt Official Website who gathered some of the industry's top session musicians to play with the young singer, turned to his cohorts and asked what they thought.   ""Amazing for a 20 year old,"" they agreed. Then Wolanin spoke up and reminded them, ""Guys, I'm only 13!"" Reflecting later on her first session at the House of Bob studio in the vintage Victorian house whose vibe was very much like Grand Avenue in Detroit, where the early Motown classics were cut she says, ""I went in there wanting to just be myself, and I was nervous at first working with all these great players. But the energy was high and the setting really inspired me. We cut four songs that first day!""   Those tracks quickly evolved the into the core of Funkology XIII, the singer's debut project whose title reflects the set's lively old school-meets-modern pop/rock grooves and the age Wolanin was when she recorded it. Produced by Babbitt with the singer's father, 35 year music industry veteran Vincent Wolanin, the collection is a fun-filled gathering of soul classics, some very familiar (""This Old Heart Of Mine,"" ""What Becomes of The Brokenhearted,"" ""Young And In Love"") and others magical but a bit more obscure (""Martha and The Vandellas"" ""Quicksand,"" Smokey Robinson's ""Head To Toe""). On ""Quicksand,"" the singer pulls off the amazing feat of literally ""swinging with her voice"", along with the band.   Wolanin fashions another Robinson chestnut, ""Mickey's Monkey,"" into her own thing with a whimsical reworking called ""Whitney's Monkey,"" and she recorded Funkology XIII's new single (February 14, 2006 release to radio) ""It Takes Two"" (originally done by Marvin Gaye and Kim Weston) with famed Survivor lead singer Jimi Jamison.  Jimi Jamison Official Website The lone original number, a self-empowerment anthem appropriately and simply titled ""Good,"" has spent an astounding 45 plus weeks on FMQB's AC40 Radio Airplay Chart (peaking at #7 last November), and Wolanin's lighthearted holiday gem ""Christmas (The Warmest Time Of The Year)"" was the most added song at radio four weeks in a row. Both ""GOOD"" and ""Christmas"" appeared in the Top 100 Airplay Chart at the same time. On the FMQB AC40 Top 40 Radio Chart of Feb 14th 2006 ""It Takes Two"" was the number 1 added song and reached the Top 10 at #9 on the April 12, 2006 radio chart while ""GOOD"" was still on the Top 100 chart so both songs again duplicated the next to impossible feat of being on the chart at the same time.   ""We picked the songs based on what I thought was best for my range and which allowed me to vocally be my best,"" says Wolanin. ""I've always been told my voice had soul in it, so I thought it would be fun to focus on R&B to establish myself. The best part of the whole experience was finally being able to record songs I love and get some music out there. From the time I started singing when I was two years old, I've wanted to sing for as many people as possible. It's not just about trying to be famous, but about my love and passion for the music.""   ""Still, I'm not limiting myself to old school R&B, she adds. ""I love all kinds of music, and some of the new original material I'm working on now is more modern, with a next generation Destiny's Child flavor. I'm also eager to do more pop/rock material.""   At the tender age of 15, the charismatic singer with the four and a half octave range is developing into more than simply a star, but an artist of substance and an inspiration to young girls with dreams everywhere. On March 26, 2006 Wolanin, backed by Babbitt and many of the other ""Funk Brothers,"" appeared and rocked the event as one of the headliners along with The Commodores--at the Naples Music Festival.   In 2005, she appeared on the front page of the Apple iTunes website twice. Wolanin also sang the national anthem before hundreds of thousands of people at Fenway Park, Shea Stadium and other major league parks, plus at a series of games for the Yankees, Red Sox, Twins, Phillies, Reds, etc. and also at Pro Player Stadium before a Miami Dolphins game. She has five baseball games scheduled already for the 2006 season.   At the National Girls Basketball Championship in Texas, there were 2,500 young girls on one side of the court and 2,500 parents on the other. By the time Wolanin who was at the event making a promotional appearance--performed her second song, hundreds from both sides stormed the floor past the security guards and were on the floor dancing. Her popularity on the teen basketball circuit which extends to being a starter on her own high school basketball team as well earned her a feature article in the national magazine Women's Basketball.   The University of Tennessee, which has one of the top women's basketball teams in the country, sponsored a nine game special event where they gave away 288 copies of ""Good"" at each game and put Wolanin's bright smile on the scoreboard. Each year, the Wolanin Family puts on a Rockin' Christmas Party for charity, featuring an All-Star band comprised of members of famous rock groups. At those events, Wolanin performs along with rockers from AC/DC, Survivor, Loverboy, Kansas, the Funk Brothers, and Starship; proceeds go to Cancer research, the local Children's Hospitals and to fund a permanent scholarship endowment for needy students. In 2005, Wolanin did a national campaign with every Children's and Shriners Hospital in every state in the US, whereby all the sick children received a copy of her Christmas record.   While Wolanin, currently hard at work on her second album and a Christmas album, is eager to go on her first full-scale tour, she is focused on maintaining a balance between making music and being a regular teenager. No matter where her career takes her, she is adamant about remaining enrolled at her high school, where she is in the International Baccalaureate World School Program, an intense course of study, which assigns college level work. Naturally, while playing on the basketball team and also playing softball and volleyball for fun, the singer maintains a straight A average.   ""There are so many things in life that I enjoy, but ever since I can remember, singing was the one thing I knew I was going to do,"" Wolanin says. ""It's a lot of fun to have all these things happening career-wise, but on a more meaningful level, I love having people relate to the music, and relate to what I'm going through in my life through the songs I sing. When they sing along, I know I'm reaching them, and there's nothing greater for me than experiencing that emotional connection.""

The choice of Garry, a white man, over a black lawyer upset many Party members and other blacks in the community of Oakland. However, Bobby Seale stressed the importance of hiring the best lawyer for Newton's case, and justly denounced Garry's critics as black racists. Garry could be called a lawyer of the people in the truest sense. He worked tirelessly to do what was right, first risking his life defending a labor union, and later working for and sticking with the Black Panthers. Bobby Seale proudly called Garry the ""Lenin of the Courtroom"", and worked with him on many of his own cases. Charles R.

This word has become a part of everyday vocabulary, yet many of us do not understand this word. Do not understand what grief and pain it causes to its victims, nor do they understand why people choose to destroy the peace of the world. Terrorism is defined in the dictionary as The unlawful use or threatened use of violence by a person or an organised group against people or property with the intention of intimidating societies or governments, often for ideological or political reasons. However, this definition is only a sentence; it cannot possibly begin to convey the emotion, damage, conflict, and pain that terrorism can cause. Though terrorism occurs on all four corners of the globe, people only know what the biased media chooses to tell them.   Terrorism has occurred on Earth since early Roman times. Back then, there were no words for terrorism, although the acts imposed upon the ancient Roman world were similar to those imposed on the society of today. People were willing to inflict terror and panic on others, in order to make their voices heard. Today, America, as Ancient Rome was, is the single superpower of the world, therefore a great terrorist target. History is purely repeating itself. The word terrorism comes with a dilemma; establishing what exactly terrorism is. Who is the one that decides what is terrorism and who the real terrorists are? Is one societys terrorist, anothers martyr?   Through terrorism, a persons life, family, and beliefs are destroyed in a split-second. In that split second, they are forced into a world that they thought they would never have to live in. Families are shattered; children are growing up with no parents, in a society full of fear. This message is illustrated in the poem The Presidents Speech, about September 11. The orphans whose mums or dads only went to work, the grandparents suddenly snapped from the tree of generations, their children, soft gray ash...   Beliefs and faith of the youth are being destroyed along with their families and the normality of life that they have grown up knowing. Children have little knowledge of the world around them, they believe that their parents will always be there to protect them, and keep them safe. They have an illusion that the shelter of a parents arm means that nothing can hurt them. When terrorism occurs, children are forced to lose this illusion, and grow up fearing the world and its people. This is shown in the poem Through the eyes of a child by Kathy Tyndale, about September 11. Mummy, why would someone want to hurt my dad? He did nothing wrong and he is not bad. Will they come and hurt us too? I will be very scared if they do. Mummy, I dont understand what has gone wrong However, it is not only young children that are affected but teenagers as well. Their faith in the government has declined rapidly since September 11. A survey conducted in the weeks following the New York attacks by New York City based company Harris Interactive showed that only 36% of American teenagers feel that the government will be able to prevent another terrorism attack. The survey also showed that 49.3% were fearful that a terrorism attack would strike near them. Todays teenagers are growing up with a constant fear for their lives and the lives of their loved ones. This fear is also illustrated in youth literature, such as Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince by J.K Rowling. Though this book is fantasy, it shares parallels with recent terrorism acts.   Furthermore, adults are also beginning to question their government. In another survey by 911truth.org, 49.3% of New York City residents and 41% of New York State citizens believe that the U.S government failed to act on knowledge about September 11. Worldwide, people are slowly loosing their faith in their government. Additionally, this is related to media coverage of terrorism events.   Media in Australia mainly focuses on American, British and other Allied countries terrorism attacks. The Australian media alongside the government chooses to place Australia in a cocoon, protecting its citizens from the reality of terrorism outside its borders. John Howard, Prime Minister of Australia, chooses only to warn the Australian public of a terrorist threat when it is the best advantage to him. In 2005, there were over twenty-five terrorism attacks worldwide, many of them a series of suicide bombings. Yet, in Australia, only two of these were focused on by the media; July 7 London Bombings and October 1 Bali Bombings. Additionally, 21 of these attacks occurred in the Middle East, in which Australia and other Allied countries such as America and England are at war with. There have also been many terrorism threats within Australia, none of which have been disclosed to the public.   Furthermore, though George W Bush constantly declares that America is opposed to terrorism, research has proved contrary to this. An interview in November 2001 with Noam Chomsky, Institute Professor Emeritus of linguistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology revealed that, The U.S. is officially committed to what is called ""lowintensity warfare"". If you read the definition of lowintensity conflict in army manuals and compare it with official definitions of ""terrorism"" in army manuals, you find theyre almost the same.

The Executive Committee of the Law Club consists of an elected body of students who, in conjunction with sponsoring firms, organise events for the student body. The social calendar is rich and diverse, varying from year to year as the Executive cCmmittee membership changes. Studying law is synonymous with hard work and dedication; so it is the overriding objective of the Law Club to introduce balance into students' lives. The Law Club's activities fall into two main categories. First of all, the organisation of social functions, including several highly successful balls. These events also provide an opportunity for students to socialise with members of staff and network with representatives of the major City law firms. Secondly, the Club is responsible for the running of the School's Mooting Competition and the Hunt Cup (debating competition). The competitions take place throughout the acdemic year with dinners and drinks receptions organised after each round of the competitions. Furthermore, the Law Club publishes the Survival Guide (Handbook) at the beginning of the academic year and Dicta (UBLC Law Journal and Annual Report) at the end of the academic year. Anyone, including non-law students, is welcome to become a member of the Law Club and students from all years are entitled to stand for election to the Executive Committee. Hustings are held at the end of the Spring Term and Executive Committee membership lasts for one academic year. For more information please do not hesitate to contact me.

These are the kind of concept instances that were used in one of the first machine learning programs developed by Patrick Winston. ( P. H. Winston, Learning Structural Descriptions from Examples. In P. H. Winston (Ed.), The Psychology of Computer Vision. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1975. Pp. 157-209).This early machine learning artifact focused research attention on the importance of the training sequence in concept learning. Below is shown a particular training sequence. When you attempted to learn the earlier concept example you may have noticed that at any point in time you entertained very few hypotheses...often only one. This, despite the fact that the number of hypotheses consistent with the training sequence is usually very large. Our learning strategy does not at all appear to be one that is similar to an exhaustive breadth first search.    Winston's learner shared this characteristic with us. In fact, this learning program never entertains more than a single hypothesis at a time. But what are some of the possible consequences of following a strategy such as this? Consider the figures below which depict some of the possible relations between the Learner's hypothesis and the Teacher's hypothesis. The yellow circle depicts the space of possible concepts. The green circle depicts the space of concept instances that are consistent with the Teacher's hypothesis and the blue circle depicts the space of concept instances that are consistent with the Learner's hypothesis.   In the first figure the Learner's hypothesis defines only a subset of the possible instances consistent with the 'true' concept definition. In this case the Learner's hypothesis must become more general in order to capture the concept that is being taught. In the middle figure the Teacher's concept defines a subset of the possible instances consistent with the Learner's Hypothesis. In this case the Learner's hypothesis is too general and it must become more specific in order to capture the concept that is being taught. And in the third figure the Teacher and Learner concept intersect. In this case both generalization and specialization are required in order to learn the concept that is being taught.     Learner's Concept defines a Subset of instances consistent with the Teacher's Concept    Learner's Concept defines a Superset of instances consistent with the Teacher's Concept    Learner's Concept defines a instances that are inconsistent with the Teacher's Concept    Winston viewed the learning task as one that involvedÂ :     representing the current example;   predicting from the representation of the current hypothesis whether or not the current instance exemplifies the concept;    if correct then retain the current hypothesis;   if incorrect then    identify the differences between the current example and the current concept;   choose from this set of differences and use the chosen differences to    generalize the concept hypothesis if the instance was a positive instance or   specialize the concept hypothesis if the instance was a negative instance.                 The figure below illustrates these actions for the first three examples of the training sequence show above. The first example is a positive instance of the concept of an 'arch' and the next two are negative instances. A positive instance is always presented first in the sequence to enable the learner to establish a positive hypothesis. The yellow square below the each of the examples contains a a description of the example in the representation language of the learner. These are illustrated as a graph in a form that was referred to as a semantic net. The gray squares at the bottom provide the representation of the learner's hypothesis after the example had been processed. The semantic net representation can also be expressed in the syntax of a predicate logic. However, viewing these representations in this graphical form may help you to mentally imagine matching the network representing the hypothesis against the network representing the example.    Consider the first example above. The semantic net describes this positive example as consisting of three objects (B1, B2, and B3) which are all blocks. B1 and B2 support B3. The orientation of B1 and B2 is standing and B3's orientation if lying. Note this representation does not encode size, exact location, and color. If any of these features were a defining characteristic of the concept 'arch,' then this learner would never attain a completely accurate definition of the concept. Winston refers to the representations shown in the gray boxes as the learner's model of the concept. I have referred to this as the learner's hypothesis concerning the definition of the concept. I will use the terms interchangeably here. With only a slight change, the description of the example becomes the learner's initial model of the concept. The changes will always be shown in green so that you can easily identify them. Here the change is to replace the names of the specific blocks, B1, B2, and B3; with variables, X, Y and Z. This is an example of a generalization. The learner has assumed that objects other than these three blocks can be used to construct an instance of an 'arch.' This seems quite innocuous, but notice other possible generalizations were not made. For example, the constants 'LYING' and 'STANDING' could also have been replace with variables. This would have resulted in an overgeneralization since the orientation does matter.   Consider the second example. This is a negative example. If we match the current model  the first network shown in the lower left  against the description of the current example  the second network shown in the middle; we find two mismatches. The model contains two 'SUPPORT' relations whereas the current example contains no 'SUPPORT' relation. However, the learner does not know whether the presence of these relations is crucial to the definition of the concept. Consequently, the learner would guess  incorrectly  that the example was a positive example of an arch. On learning that this guess was wrong, the learner needs to revise the model. The constraint on the revision is that the new model must predict that the first example is positive and that the second example is negative. The revision shown involves adding to the model that the 'SUPPORT' relation must be part of the concept definition  it is elevated from a characteristic of one exemplar to a defining characteristic of the concept. Consequently, this model will now correctly reject the second example as an example of an arch.   The negative example has served to cause the learner to specialize the model. The third example, which is also negative, will lead to further specialization of the model. Again, the model predicts that the example is positive since nothing in the model precludes he supporting blocks from touching. The example is of course a negative example and the only aspect of its description that doesn't match the model is the 'TOUCHES' relation. Consequently, the revision involves adding to the model the requirement that the supporting blocks 'MUST NOT TOUCH.'   Notice that whenever the learner mistakenly identifies an example, the revision is selected from the set of mismatches obtained when the model is compared with the description of the current example. Winston's program classified the types of mismatches that could occur and based on this classification proposed an appropriate revision. However, if there are many mismatches, then the learner can be led astray. This is because the learner has no way of knowing whether all, some or only one of the mismatches led to the erroneous classification. In this case there may be several, perhaps many (the power set of the number of mismatches - 1), possible models that could be adopted. But the learner has been constrained to have only one model at any point in time. If the wrong model is chosen, the concept may never be learned.   For this reason, the training sequence can be the factor that decides whether or not the learner acquired the concept. Specifically, Winston argues that the ideal training sequence is one where each example is a 'near miss.' A near miss is a training example that is only minimally different from the learner's current model. Ideally the training example should differ in only one aspect from the learner's current model. In this case, only one revision is possible and therefore the learner can not make the wrong choice. If the entire training sequence consists of 'near misses' then the teacher can systematically guide the learner toward the correct model of the concept. Of course, this presupposes that the teacher have knowledge of the learner's current model at each stage in the learning. Reading learners' mind is not a skill that every teacher masters. Nonetheless, Winston's learning artifact has clarified for use when and why the sequence of training examples can play such a crucial role in learning.   This type of learning model is an example of what is termed supervised learning. There is a teacher that bears the responsibility for supervising the learning that occurs. But what happens when learning is unsupervised? Is learning still possible? Are there ways to alter the learning strategy to yield a learning method that is less dependent on intelligent and benevolent supervision? These are some of the issues that we will explore as we examine other research on machine and human learning.

At age 12 when his father decided to return to Lebanon,Imam Mohammad Mehdi decided to stay and finish his religious studies under famous scholars among them al imama al-Khoei and al imam Muhsin al-Hakeem. During his stay of over 30 years in Iraq he worked closely with Imam imam Musa Sadr, imam Mohammad Baqir as-Sadr, imam Mohammad Baqir al-Hakim among others. Upon his return to Lebanon in 1969 he helped Musa Sadr founding the Supreme Shia Islamic Council that came to light in 1975 and became its first vice-president. Later in April 1994 he was elected president of the Supreme Shia Islamic Councila its president, Imam Musa Sadr, has been kidnapped since september of 1978. He was a staunch advocate of Christian-Muslim coexistence in a country which has struggled to overcome confessional divisions since the devastating 1975-1990 civil war. ""There is no Lebanon without its Christians and there is no Lebanon without its Muslims,"" he once said. Shamseddine was known for his moderation and diplomacy. He led the Shia Higher Council, the highest body for Lebanon's 1.2 million Shi'as, from 1994 until his death.   He was deputy to the council's founder, Imam Mussa Sadr, who disappeared in mysterious circumstances during a trip to Libya in 1978.    He was staunch supporter of the resistance against the Israeli aggressions in the region. In Lebanon he formed the Wide Civil Resistance group after Ashura 1983 to counter the Israeli invasion of June 1982. He also established the Islamic University in Lebanon among many other institutions.

[ edit ]   What is ACND?   ACND is an illness whereby the immune system starts recognising the heart and it's vessels as foreign objects and develops antibodies towards the organ. The disease also affects the brain, causing autonomic neuropathy, which is where the autonomic & central nervous system works irregularly causing many problems to other systems.     [ edit ]   How common is ACND?   There have been only 1092 reported cases of ACND in the past 10 years, a number that is predicted to increase rapidly over the next decade. Although the numbers seem low, there is some evidence that ACND may be more common with a prediction of over 10,000 undiagnosed cases in the world. There is also some evidence that some infants diagnosed with SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome) may have had ACND.     [ edit ]   What is the cause of ACND?   It is unknown what cases ACND, but the most common speculation is a virus. More than 98% of patients with ACND suffered from an infectious disease 5 months or more prior to the diagnosis. This is why many cases are diagnosed as  chronic fatigue syndrome  instead of ACND. This miss diagnosis can be fatal.

It is a Flash based game, using a wrapping container developed by Phenomedia, utilizing prerendered 3D cute characters designed by  Guillermo Mordillo .   The game play is easy: Jump from vine to vine, grab the girl, and go back the way you came. The challenge lies in the later levels with crocodiles, snakes, monkeys, and giraffes providing obstacles. The player automatically slides down to the bottom of elephant trunks. However, if you swing on a snake's tail, there is nothing to stop the player from falling off, so a jump has to be done when the tail is all the way onward. Crocodiles and monkeys will knock the player off the vine. In the water levels, if you fall into the water, you can pump the action key to make it to the other side. If you're carrying the girl when you get knocked off the vine, she is lost.   A very interesting and amusing game to spend a break on.

Two new replacement platforms are under construction and expected to open in 2007.   [edit] Woolwich Arsenal Extension Status - Under Construction   An extension of the London City Airport branch from King George V to Woolwich Arsenal is under construction. This requires a second DLR tunnel crossing of the River Thames. The projected cost of 150 million expected to be met through the Private Finance Initiative. Construction began in June 2005, and is due to be completed in February 2009.[4]   [edit] Upgrading Bank - Lewisham route to 3-car trains Status - TWA and financial approval given   There is formal approval to upgrade the lines between Bank station and Lewisham station to allow operation of 3-car trains and increase capacity. As an alternative, more frequent trains were considered but it was found that the necessary signalling changes would be as expensive as upgrading to longer trains, and provide fewer benefits. [5]   It is expected that the work will be carried out during 2007-2009. The work involves the lengthening of platforms on most stations on the route, together with viaduct-strengthening works to support the longer trains. Most of this section dates from the initial system originally built for single-car operation. South Quay station will require locating as nearby curves preclude lengthening. The below-ground Cutty Sark station will not be extended due to the cost and the risk to nearby historic buildings. Instead, use of Selective Door Operation (SDO) has been approved by the Railway Inspectorate at this station.   Although not on the Bank - Lewisham route, two other stations will be modified to improve operational flexibility. Poplar station will also be lengthened, whilst Tower Gateway is due to be converted from its current two-track terminal layout into a single longer platform. However the exact details of the Tower Gateway work are under review.[6].   [edit] Langdon Park station Status - Under Constuction   A planning application for a station at Langdon Park between All Saints and Devons Road has been submitted. The plan envisages the station opening in late 2007.   [edit] Stratford International Extension / North London Line conversion Status - Awaiting Transport & Works Act approval from the Government   This will be an extension from Canning Town to the new Stratford International station, linking Docklands with domestic and international high-speed services on the Channel Tunnel Rail Link. Four new stations will be built, at Star Lane, Abbey Road, Stratford High Street, and Stratford International, with a possible fifth station between Cody Road and Canning Town. The branch will also serve London Underground and National Rail stations at West Ham and Stratford. All stations will be capable of accommodating three-unit trains.   As part of the TWA application the DLR station at Royal Victoria on the Beckton branch will be extended to accommodate three-unit trains. Additionally it will have a third platform. The extra platform becomes possible because the part of the North London Line due to be abandoned currently runs parallel to Royal Victoria station.[7]   The extension will largely run over part of the North London Line, which will in future terminate at Stratford. The extension is projected to open early in 2010 and is an important part of the transport improvement package for the 2012 Olympic Games, which will largely be held on a site adjoining Stratford International.   [edit] Upgrading other lines to 3-car trains Status - TWA application being prepared   Once the work to allow three-car trains between Bank station and Lewisham station hase been completed, the only parts of the network unable to accommodate longer trains will be between Poplar station and Stratford station, and between Poplar and Beckton station. There is therefore a proposal to upgrade the remainder of the line with the aim of carrying out the work between 2008 and 2010.   As part of this work, it is proposed to enchance the junction north of West India Quay station, which would preclude services on the Bank to Lewisham route from stopping at West India Quay station.   [edit] Barking Reach extension Status - Being planned, Route safeguarded   This is a proposed extension from Gallions Reach to Dagenham Dock via the riverside at Barking. This would connect the Barking Reach area, a formerly industrial area now undergoing major redevelopment, with the Docklands. This new route would cover major developments at Creekmouth, Barking Riverside, Dagenham Dock Oppotunity Area. The Extension is key if English Partnerships plan is to work. A possible opening date according to the DLR website is 2016.   [edit] Thames Wharf station Status - Proposed   This station had been included as potential future development on the London City Airport extension since it was first planned. It would be located between Canning Town and West Silvertown, due west of the western end of Royal Victoria Dock. Since the station's intended purpose is to serve the surrounding area (currently a mix of brownfield and run-down industrial sites) when it is regenerated, the development is indefinitely on-hold due to the area being safeguarded for the Silvertown Link, a new thames river crossing proposed for opening by 2015.[8]   [edit] Connaught Road\Silvertown Interchange station Status - Proposed   A site near to London City Airport has been at least been given provision of a future possible second station on the London City Airport extension. There, it will be a possible interchange with Crossrail. It is to be located between London City Airport and Pontoon Dock. However, no plans have emerged as to when this station is to be planned and built. The original extension was designed to allow a station to be built here in the future. It may be located south of the Connaught Crossing.[9]   [edit] Charing Cross extension Status - Proposed   In February 2006 a proposal to extend the DLR to Charing Cross station (running from either the Bank or Tower Gateway DLR branches) was publicly revealed[6]. The idea, originating from a DLR ""Horizon Study"", is in very early stages at the moment, but would involve extending the line from in bored tunnels under Central London to the Charing Cross Jubilee line platforms which would be brought back to public use. These platforms are now located on a spur that branches off the current Jublilee line and they are not now used by passenger trains.   While not specifically confirmed it is implied that the scheme would also use the existing overrun tunnels between the Charing Cross Jubilee platforms and a location slightly to the west of Aldwych. These tunnels were intended to be later incorporated into the abandoned Phase 2 of the 'Fleet Line' (Phase 1 became the original Jubilee Line as existed prior to the Jubilee Line Extension). However they would need some enlargement because DLR gauge is larger than tube gauge and modern safety regulations would almost certainly require a narrow walkway to be provided in the tunnel.   The two reasons reported as driving the proposal were capacity problems at Bank, having basically one interchange between the DLR and the central portion of Underground, and the difficult journeys faced by passengers from Kent and South Coast between their rail termini and the DLR.   213.249.207.190  17:03, 14 May 2006 (UTC)     [ edit ]   Sources     [ edit ]   Sources   Bitchioward (bich-oward) - is a term that is used for people that get slapped in the face all the time and do not do anything back or make any failed effort to do so.

Coaching interactions are then used to highlight themes, theories and models, which enable participants to understand, discover and benefit from the experiential element from the musical improvisation, thus causing change to occur in the participants and how they relate to themselves and others.

Most of the Episodes which run as part of the 26 Episode run are offically Cannon for this show but mostly have been changed to include comments on Fan Created Characters which appear in the TSW Series. The Show then comes into force as it carrys on as a 'Third Series' for the 2 Series run of Sonic the Hedgehog (13 episodes in each).   TSW first started with a few small Writen 'Fan Fic' storys which were re-writen into still small volumes. In 2004 an 4 part- half Hour Audio Drama was created and this launched TSW more then before. Since then, a Short Animated Episode Pilot 'TSWA' (The Sonic World Animated) was created as well as a Short series of Short musical Episodes showcasing different character historys. As Of late last year, a Short Series 'The Adventures of Mighty and Ray' was created to introduce classic Sonic Characters of 'Mighty' and 'Ray' into the TSW World along with a new character 'Valaria'. This characters are rumoured to re-appear in one of the current In Production Projects. At the Moment, a 10 Episode Series of TSWA is in Production as well as a Computer Game.     [ edit ]   The Creators:   TSW was created by Two people Living in Hastings, England. Manic Man and Bluedude. They were School friends and big Fans of Sonic from a young age. As they grew up, they have been able to use skills they learnt to carry on and make there 'storys' and ideas into a full series. Though Bluedude has started his Name online, Manic seams to prefer not to give out much detail on his real life name, saying that 'it doesn't matter, it's the storys that count'. Though Bluedude hasn't been seen to do much on the series, Manic has always claimed that he is a major help on the project.     [ edit ]   New Characters:   A Number of New Characters were introduce into TSW. Some are Completely new Characters, some have bases in already created Characters and some are new takes on Classic Characters.   Manic Man Hedgehog-  Although sharing the name with the Nickname of TSW Co-Creater, Manic was the first new wave of Characters for TSW. He is a Green Hedgehog which came from 'Lower Mobuis' and after a shaky start, joined the Freedom Fighters. Though Smarter then Sonic, he isn't as Smart as many and has been used as a character to help explain things to the viewers, for Scenes where Sonic isn't around. Most of his time is spent being tormented my Female 'Amical Nett', and shares a friendy enermy tie with Whirlwind Hedgehog, created by other TSW Co-created 'Bluedude'.   Amical Nett-  Amical Nett is a Young Brown Cat (Created has quoted as say she is a 'Mobuion Comman Brown') which joined the cast after being saved by Sonic The Hedgehog and Sally Acorn. She also came from Lower Mobuis and in the TSW Short 'A Manic life' it was show that she started off feeling Sorry for Manic, but this grew into a Major Crush. She Shared a Hut with Amy Rose.   Tiara Bobowski-  Although not a Completely New Character, Tiara is though as a New TSW Character. She was Oringal created for the Canceled game 'Sonic X-treme'. Only 1 Offical Image of the character was none to have been created and he design was taken from this. The Character Colours were created by Co-Created Manic Man and a few others. Later the Offical Colour design was found out in an Interview with Game Producer, but Manic has said this colour set up will never be used. Tiara is shown as being very shy after spending most of her life along with only a Computer for friendship but some of the others have been trying to 'help' her out.   Whirlwind Hedgehog-  This Character was created along time ago with Co-Creater 'Bluedude' was a kid and bought into TSW. Whirlwind is the Son of Sir Charles Hedgehog, which makes him a cosion to Sonic The Hedgehog. At a Young age he was kidnapped and returned when older. The Story meant to explain all this (Whirlwind's Story) has been in pre-production for almost 10 years, way before TSW was even created.   Valaria Renard-  Valaria is the Main 'Bad Guy' of the Mighty and Ray Mini-Series. Not too much about the character history is given in the show but she is shown to be very smart and carefully plans out her actions.     [ edit ]   Episodes:   So far, only a small amount of 'Episodes' have been done but the do showcase the growing skill of the main writer, Manic Man. These are:   Introducing the Manic Man-  Early Writen story based on early 'Pre-TSW' storys. Introduces the Characters of Manic Man, Shadow and Dark Manic and set up many later storys   Meet the Gang-  Second Writen story which was based on an early 'Pre-TSW' story. Introduces the Characters of Amy Rose, Amical Nett, The Proffessor, Tiara Bobowski and 'Cherry'.   Power of the Chaos Emeralds-  Third Writen Story, not based on Early 'Pre-TSW' story. Introduces Tikal, Knuckles, as well as a demon none also as 'Super Sonic'.

L. Houget,  USNR , in command.   PC-1145  completed  shakedown  training in the  Gulf of Mexico  on  11 June  and reported for duty to the Commander,  Gulf Sea Frontier . For the next year, the submarine chaser plied the waters of the Gulf of Mexico and the  Atlantic  seaboard conducting  anti-submarine  patrols and escorting coastwise  convoys , In the performance of those duties, the little warship ranged as far north as  New York City  and as far south as the  Panama Canal Zone .   Following the  victory in Europe ,  PC-1145  received orders assigning her to the  Pacific Fleet . Early in June 1945, she departed her base at  Miami, Florida , and headed via the  Panama Canal  for the  California  coast and underwent  repairs  at  San Diego, California , before continuing west to  Hawaii . She departed San Diego on  15 July  and arrived in  Pearl Harbor  on the  21st . She did not resume her westward voyage toward the  Marshall Islands  until  7 August . The submarine chaser reported for duty upon her arrival at  Eniwetok Atoll  on the  13th , but hostilities ceased the following day.   Nevertheless, the submarine chaser remained in the  western Pacific  more than a year. For about a month following her arrival, she performed  patrol  and  escort  duty in the Marshalls and the  Carolines . On  7 September , she departed Eniwetok for a round-trip voyage to  Japan , returning almost a month later, on  5 October . The ship then resumed her patrol and escort duties in the Marshalls and Carolines. After a round-trip voyage to  Wake Island  late in October, she reported to the atoll commander at  Majuro  in November for duty as station  search and rescue  ship. That assignment lasted until mid-February  1946  when she departed Majuro for extensive  maintenance  at  Guam .   She completed repairs on  16 June  and departed Guam on an inspection tour of the  Western Carolines  carrying representatives of the  United States Commercial Company , a public corporation charged with responsibility for the economic rehabilitation of the  Central Pacific  region. For the next four months,  PC-1145  served the United States Military Government administering the Central Pacific islands and worked hand-in-hand with officials of the United States Commercial Company surveying the region in preparation for efforts to reestablish a viable local  economy .   In November, she departed the Central Pacific for her first complete  overhaul  since commissioning. She entered the  Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard  on  21 November  and remained there until  23 December . On that date, she reported to the Commander,  Fleet Training Center , Pearl Harbor, under whose auspices she conducted refresher training and made a cruise to  Hilo .  PC-1145  departed Pearl Harbor on  27 February   1947 , and on  4 March , arrived at  Midway Island  where she reported for duty to the Commander,  Naval Operating Base, Midway . There, she served as an air search and rescue ship until the end of the second week in May. Relieved by  PC-1172  on the  13th ,  PC-1145  headed back to Pearl Harbor. The warship operated out of the  Oahu  base conducting upkeep and repairs and serving as a training ship until late July. She then returned to Midway and resumed duty as search and rescue vessel. On 15 November,  PCS-1399  relieved her at Midway; and  PC-1145  returned to Pearl Harbor for a restricted availability.   For the remainder of her active career,  PC-1145  alternated between duty out of Pearl Harbor and service as an air search and rescue ship, at first based at Midway but later at  Kwajalein ,  Johnston Island , Guam, and  Samoa . After  1950 , however, Guam and Samoa ceased to be  duty stations  for the submarine chaser and her sister ships.   Duty in and out of Pearl Harbor consisted of repairs,  training ,  target  towing, and  anti-submarine warfare  operations.  PC-1145  departed Pearl Harbor for the last time on  19 February   1955  and arrived in  San Francisco, California , a week later. F ollowing nearly four months of repairs at  Treasure Island , she stood out of  San Francisco Bay  on her way to  Astoria, Oregon , and inactivation. On  15 August  1955, the ship was placed out of commission at Astoria and was berthed with the  Columbia River Group ,  Pacific Reserve Fleet . On  15 February   1956 , the submarine chaser--still inactive--was named  Winnemucca , after a city in northwestern  Nevada  situated on the  Humboldt River , and the seat of government for  Humboldt County . She remained with the reserve fleet until  1 June   1960  when her name was struck from the  Navy list . On  1 November , she was transferred to the Navy of the  Republic of Korea .

She sailed, via the  Mississippi River  and  New Orleans, Louisiana , to the  Gulf of Mexico  and conducted  shakedown  training out of  Miami, Florida . During her first year of service,  PC-1149  cruised the waters along the east coast of the  United States  and in the  Caribbean Sea . She patrolled for  German   U-boats  and  escorted  coastal and Caribbean  convoys  from port to port. The submarine chaser ranged as far north as  New York  and as far south as  Guantanamo Bay ,  Cuba .   On  13 June   1945 , about a week before the first anniversary of her active service, she transited the  Panama Canal  and joined the  Pacific Fleet . After stopping at  San Diego, California , and at  Pearl Harbor , she arrived at  Eniwetok  in the  Central Pacific  on  28 July ; then sailed the following day for the  Marianas . She reached  Saipan  on  1 August  and remained there through the end of  the war  and into September. After a brief voyage to  Iwo Jima  early that month,  PC-1149  returned to the Marianas and operated in that island group for a little more than a year. In November  1946 , she returned, via Kwajalein and Pearl Harbor, to the  United States , arriving at the  Columbia River   Reserve Fleet  berthing area in Oregon in mid-December. On  20 February   1947 ,  PC-1149  was placed out of commission and berthed at Columbia River.   On  15 February   1956 , while still out of commission, she was named  Susanville , after a town in  Lassen County  in northeastern  California . Sixteen months later, on  16 July   1957 ,  Susanville  was transferred, on loan, to the  Nationalist Chinese  Navy and was commissioned as  Hsi Kiang . She served the  Taiwan Navy  until  30 June   1972  when she was transferred to the  Taiwan Customs Service .

clueweb09-en0002-59-19709	          Pagan Book Reviews                                 Celtic Totem Animals by JohnÂ Matthews                  December 29, 2008 at 5:57 pm     ( Animal Magic ,   Celtic spirituality and studies ,   Drumming ,   Shamanism )                                         Celtic Totem Animals  John Matthews  Red Wheel/Weiser Books, 2002  192 pages plus CD and 20 cards   There are only so many ways you can rehash basic totem animal material. Usually it comes down to âWhat is a totem animal? How do I meet my totem? What does each totem mean? What do I do once I know my totem?â and so forth. John Matthews has attempted to try to put a Celtic spin on things, as he did with  Celtic Shamanism .    Much of the material in the book that came with this set is based on the usual neopagan totemism material, mixed with core shamanism. Guided meditations are presented as âjourneysâ (when  they are not the same thing ). Totems are painted as generally benign, and thereâs not much offered in the way of warning in case one encounters an unhappy totem animal. He also invokes a number of human-animal interactions, and shapeshifting, as âtotemicâ or âshamanicâ experiences. Some of these are real stretches of speculation; while I can see where the spirit of totemism flows through Celtic mythology, I have to question some of his historical assumptions.   Still, practically speaking, Matthews offers a pretty decent totemic system. While he limits his focus to twenty birds, mammals and the occasional cold-blooded critter that feature in Celtic myth and culture, he does briefly mention that other animals may show up as well. And his yearly cycle for working with the totems does offer a good structure for integrating theory into practice. I wish heâd spent less time talking about lore (which is what a large portion of the book is dedicated to) and more to development of the practical material, as well as discussion of his own experiences.    The totem cards are a complete disappointment. Theyâre tiny, and the card stock is about on par with a cheap postcard. They wonât last long, and the small size doesnât really allow the artwork to have as much detail as it could. The drumming CD is a nice addition, though itâs specifically tailored for the totemic âjourneyingâ described in the bookâ20 minutes of a single drum, 20 minutes of two drums, 30 minutes of one drum. As with any drumming CD, youâre limited by the time constraints of the recording.   Itâs a nice effort, but it has a number of flaws. It almost comes across as something that was created primarily to tap the market of totem and other magical âkitsâ that was just hitting its stride when the set first came out. Itâs not the worst totem kit Iâve seen, but neither is it the best. The originality of some of the material gives it some bonus points, but it could have been better.   Three pawprints out of five.

While I crosspost some of my reviews from over here there, I do some exclusives for them. I linked to some  here , and here are the newest ones as well:   The Good Cat Spell Book by Gillian Kemp   Rock Your World With the Divine Mother by Sondra Ray   Angel Animals by Allen and Linda Anderson   Nature and the Human Soul by Bill Plotkin  (this, incidentally, is the book that started my path to graduate school)                          Comments                             Beef by AndrewÂ Rimas                  October 22, 2008 at 9:10 pm     ( Academic/Journalistic Approaches ,   Animal Magic ,   Environmentalism ,   History ,   Paleopagan Cultures ,   Science )                                         Beef: The Untold Story of How Milk, Meat, and Muscle Shaped the World  Andrew Rimas  William Morrow and Co., 2008  256 pages   You may very well be wondering why it is that I have a book on the history of the relationship between domestic cattle and humanity on a pagan book review blog. I already have reviews of other books that are about specific animals, such as  Of Wolves and Men by Lopez  and  The Sacred Paw by Shepard and Sanders . However, while those are about wild creatures,  Beef  studies the relationship we have to a domestic creatureâthe cow. Underappreciated by many modern pagans as not being âimpressiveâ enough, the cow and bull were nonetheless absolutely crucial to many paleopagan cultures, and I believe in promoting more than just the woo-woo aspect of sacred animals.   The book starts off with a modern discussion of beef as a foodstuff, the different cuts, etc. However, this is followed by an incredibly important section about cattle as sacred animals in various cultures. Thereâs also a good bit of research done on the actual history of the domestication of cattle, and why this was so important to humanityâs development.   However, even today we are still highly dependent on cattle in this world. Our health as a species through better nutrition, as well as certain areas of economy, have been largely due to cattle over the centuries, and continue to do so today. Itâs rather sobering to read through some of the material the author presents.   The wrap-up includes a hard look at the beef and milk industries today. Animal abuse is brought up, along with the horrific conditions in stockyards. And, of course, the pollution caused by the demand for more cheap beef, as well as tropical deforestation, canât be denied. While Rimas offers some potential alternatives, the main message seems to be âeat less beefâ.   Any pagan who works within the context of a culture that reveres cattle, or who works with domestic totems and animal spirits, should pick up a copy of this book. Even if neither of these applies, itâs still a fascinating and educational read. The writing style is engaging, so itâs a quick read, and quite the eye-opener.   Five hoofprints out of five.

Itâs also the newest book to focus on cat magic, and one of the more interactive ones as far as your cat is concerned.   The book focuses on the cat as a familiar. While I agree with Kemp that a familiar is an animal who actively aids in magic, I disagree that the main factor involved in whether a cat (or any animal) is a familiar is love. You can love a pet dearly, but that doesnât make hir any more likely to be a familiar than a family member would be a magician hirself. She also includes astrological profiles for cats; the information didnât particularly match my two cats, but then again astrological generalizations presented in brief often tend to be hit or miss.   Kemp provides dozens of spells for a variety of purposes, from love to prosperity to reversing your luck. Your cat simply acts as a cat normally would, and that energy is placed into the spell or divination. A good example is âTo Speed Cash to You Quicklyâ (p. 43), which basically involves enticing your cat to play with money as a toy, with a little extra âoomphâ.    While the cats are well-treated, some of the spells may offend some peoplesâ ethics. The very first spell in the book, âTo Bewitch the One You Loveâ (p. 14), involves compelling a specific person to think of you; âTo Keep the One You Loveâ (p. 17) and âFor a Lover To Return To Youâ speak more of insecurity than love. âTo Encourage Your Parents to Reconcile and Reuniteâ (p. 31) is similarly aimed at those who may be tempted to try to interfere with a situation that they may not completely understand.   The Cat Oracle is a reworking of the old divination trick of watching the movements of an animal to get an answer. Thereâs a poster in the back of the book that has a set of symbols arranged in a particular way, and however your cat moves will determine which symbol is relevant to your question. If you do have a feline familiar, this may be a neat thing to try out.   Iâm torn on how to rate this book. On the one hand, there are some useful things in here for those who like cat magic. However, on the other, the borderline manipulative spells, as well as my disagreement about what actually constitutes a familiar, and a complete lack of a bibliography or references, take away points. So Iâm going to give itâ¦   Three and a half pawprints out of five.   Want to buy this book?                          Comments                             I Am of This Land - Dan Landeen and JeremyÂ Crow                  July 14, 2008 at 7:16 pm     ( Animal Magic ,   Biology ,   Mythology ,   Native American cultures ,   Paleopagan Cultures )                                         I Am of This Land (Wetes pe mâe wes): Wildlife of the Hanford Site (A Nez Perce Nature Guide)  Dan Landeen and Jeremy Crow (compilers)  Nez Perce Tribe Environmental Restoration and Waste Management Department  1997   This is a neat book I found secondhand. Itâs a combination of natural history of various animals at the Hanford site in Washington state, and stories about the animals from Nez Perce mythology. The two areas are well blended for a wonderful look at the wild creatures that the Hanford nuclear site features.   The first section of the book is a summary of Nez Perce culture, to give context for the rest of the material. Thereâs also a good reminder of the history of the tribe in relation to the United States government, including land grabs and other abuses by the latter. Considering the book is produced by the tribe itself, one can most likely trust to its accuracy.   The rest of the book includes brief explanations of the various animalsâmammals, birds, and moreâfound at the Hanford site, as well as a special section on harmful animals such as poisonous spiders. The information for each animal is not particularly longâusually a sentence or two, if that. So donât take this as your only field guide. However, thereâs good (if a bit dated) information on the status of each species (endangered, threatened, etc.) as well as how commonly itâs found on site. Myths are interspersed throughout the text.   Overall, itâs a neat little compilation. Iâd recommend it for anyone interested in Nez Perce culture and myth, as well as anyone who like critters of any sort.   Five pawprints out of five.

Unbeknownst to me at the time, her earlier publications included a series of novels based around a fantasy world where people bond with their totems in very dramatic and magical ways.  Eyes of Crow  is the first in the trilogy.   A community of people live by the abilities bestowed upon them by their totem creatures. Some are common, others less so. Rhia, our main character, fears that she may be the first Crow woman in a generation, Crow being the harbringer of death. Amid this set of growing pains, she must also navigate love, a potential war, and the loss of those around her.   While I was a little worried that this would end up being a long, dragging novel that I couldnât wait to have over with, it was actually quite a fast and enjoyable read for its size. Smith-Ready is a talented writer who has a firm grasp of both worldbuilding and character development. Both the descriptive parts and the dialogue flow smoothly, and theyâre well balanced.   I thoroughly, thoroughly enjoyed this book, and I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking for  a new fantasy series to read. I would also highly suggest that anyone interested in animal totems pick it up, since she does a good job of creating a fictional totemic system.

Comments                             Spirit Animals and the Wheel of Life - Hal ZinaÂ Bennett                  June 19, 2008 at 12:08 am     ( Animal Magic ,   Eco-Magic ,   Environmentalism ,   Psychology )                                         Spirit Animals and the Wheel of Life: Earth-Centered Practices for Daily Living  Hal Zina Bennett  Hampton Roads Publishing Company, 2000  176 pages   There are a lot of totemism/animal spirit 101 guides out there, and it can be tough to find one that isnât the same old stuff. I am pleased to say that  Spirit Animals and the Wheel of Life  is one that stands out. Based on the authorâs personal spiritual practices formulated over several decades, and deeply rooted in ecospiritual practices, it adds a definite positive flavor to the corpus of literature on practical neopagan totemism.   At first glance, the book seems like just another rip-off of various Native American tribesâ practices. Some may suspect the wheel format, with animals at the four cardinal directions, up and down, and the center. However, the directions, the Earth and the Sky, and the self are more universal than that, and Bennett does a great job of keeping these concepts from being mock-ups of âNative American spiritualityâ. While he does talk a bit about indigenous practices, more often he speaks from his own personal background as a spiritual person as well as a psychologist.   The system that Bennett has created provides a structure for pathworking that bridges spirituality and psychology. Each position on the wheel represents a different developmental stage, and the animal associated with each position can help with its respective stage. While Bennett provides his animals for each direction, he does emphasize the fact that these are personal, particularly the power animal of the center. He also includes some examples of meditations and rituals that may be used within the structure of his wheel, which makes this a more usable system than those that simply approach the wheel from a symbolic perspective. This is wonderfully interactive material.   I think my only complaint is that he could have gone a lot deeper with the pathworking aspects of the system. He only briefly describes the stages at each point in the wheel, and I think he could have easily gone into more depth without losing the reader. The developmental aspects of his system are one of its strongest points, and Iâd like to see them taken further.   However, even as it is this is a great book. Itâs incredibly sensitive to ecological issues and the connection between neopagan totemism and the environment, as well as our role in the whole mess weâre in. It offers tools to help us reverse the damage, and emphasizes the need to connect ourselvesâto ourselves, to other living beings, to our spirituality, and to draw all these together into one cohesive view of life. The reader who expects a simple introduction to animal totems will find instead a greater wealth of knowledge and wisdom, and tools to wield them for constructive change.   Four and a half pawprints out of five.   Want to buy this book?                          Comments                             Magickal Mystical Creatures - D.J. Conway - AprilÂ BBBR                  April 24, 2008 at 11:27 am     ( Animal Magic ,   Bargain Bin Book Reviews ,   Cryptozoology/Paranormal ,   Mythology )                                         Magickal Mystical Creatures  D.J. Conway  Llewellyn, 2001  260 pages   This book was a freebie from a friend. I had been less than excited about Conwayâs  Animal Magick  and  Dancing with Dragons  (though I just got the newest edition of the latter from  newWitch magazine , so weâll see what kind of a review it gets).   I was actually surprised; I liked this one better than the other two. I still have my gripes, but I am admittedly pretty picky. This particular book is an encyclopedia of various mythological beings from around the worldâprimarily Eurasian, but with a smattering of beings from other places as well. Theyâre divided by typeâcanines, gryphons and their ilk, various types of unicorn, etc. (I do have to say I loved the illustrations, too!)   Thereâs a decent amount of information on each being gleaned from mythological and historical sources.  Additionally, Conway adds in psychological interpretations of the kind of people who could either be helped or hindered by each entity, depending on its nature. She does also recommend that dangerous beings be avoided by all but the most experienced magicians (and sometimes not even then).   I think my biggest complaint is that itâs simply not enough. Many of the beings that she recommends as being safe arenât necessarily so. For example, she presents unicorns as being mostly positive beings who can lead the reader into Faery. However, thereâs not much warning about the fact that unicorns were originally seen as fierce, dangerous creatures, and that Faery generally isnât someplace you want to just waltz on into. Even the âniceâ faeries arenât particularly safe, especially if you study the original lore. As with a lot of basic pagan titles of the mid 1990s, things that really arenât safe and easy are presented as welcoming and available to all, with little warning of potential hazards.    And this is why I strongly recommend that you not stick with just a dictionary. While this has its uses, itâs a starting point primarily, and the actual practical information comprises less than a score of pages, and itâs mostly spellwork 101. Use this guide to get you introduced to whatâs out there, but then do your research with other sources, both on magical practice and on lore surrounding the beings you want to work with.

Kim Bold offers a lovely combination of creative writing and music in this set of one book and two CDs.  Influenced by the Gaia Theory, the idea that the Earth is a conscious living being, Bold offers up stories and music inspired by spiritual conversations between Gaia and a number of animals from around the world.     The book contains six tales about such animals as Beaver, Giraffe and Panda.  In the tradition of world folklore each tale contains a lesson about human behavior through animal fables.  Theyre simply written and convey their messages in an easy to understand format.  The dialogue can be a little silly; in fact, the stories read more like something written for children than adults.   This isnt necessarily a bad thing.  The CD that is sold separately from the book, Spirit Animal Music, accompanies the stories quite nicely.  Each track is written to match each story, and makes a nice background to a read-aloud.  I could definitely see children, pagan and otherwise, really enjoying getting to hear these stories with Bolds beautiful musical compositions creating additional depth to the words and actions of the animals.     Speaking of the music, Bold is quite an accomplished artist in that respect as well.  The Spirit Animal Music CD weaves her flutes along with assorted percussion and keyboard accents.  Even purchased alone it would make an excellent relaxing soundtrack to a meditation or to calm the ambience of a workspace.     Similar music also creates the background to the CD which comes with the book, Meeting Your Spirit Animal.  This is a pretty standard totem animal meditation which first relaxes the listener, then guides hir through a cave and into an alternate reality where s/he can meet hir animal.  Its longer, running nearly a half an hour, a third of which is preparation.  Some people may find this to be too long, but the meditation itself is quite effective, so you might skip ahead to a couple minutes before it begins if you dont need as much prep time.     The book only dedicates a couple of pages at the back of the book to practical animal totem work, then makes a recommendation of five books for further reading, including Andrews acclaimed  Animal Speak , and the popular but culturally appropriative  Medicine Cards  by Sams and Carson.  The basic message is that you need to determine for yourself what your animal is telling you.  This is fine if you have some familiarity with totemism, but a brand new beginner may be a little lost without additional 101 information.  It might have been better to package the Spirit Animal Music CD with the book, and save the Meeting Your Spirit Animal CD for a new book.  Id love to see Bold come out with a more practical guide to animal magic based on her unique view of animal spirits, provided she could avoid falling into the just another totem animal dictionary trap.

Comments                             When Elephants Weep - Masson andÂ McCarthy                  February 27, 2008 at 2:18 pm     ( Academic/Journalistic Approaches ,   Animal Magic ,   Biology ,   Environmentalism ,   Science )                                         When Elephants Weep: The Emotional Lives of Animals  Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson and Susan McCarthy  Dell Publishing, 1995  292 pages   While this isnât strictly a âpagan bookâ, itâs one Iâve been wanting to read for some time. As a totemist and animal magician, I believe itâs exceptionally important to study the natural history of animals as well as the more abstract mythology, lore, and UPG.    This book explores the emotions of species of animals ranging from ants to whales. Numerous anecdotes are given, particularly involving primates, cetaceans, and African gray parrots. These are used to put forth discussions and considerations of the debate as to whether or not nonhuman animals have emotions, and to what extent they share emotional states and expressions with us. We are not told what we must believe; the authors make their arguments, but they are not entirely dogmatic. Instead, they present their case, give their examples, and beseech the reader to consider what they have offered up. Responsibility is placed in the hands of the reader; we are not spoonfed the answers.    Let me make something clear: this book was not written by scientists. If youâre looking for hard scientific evidence for animal neurology and related fields, this isnât it. One author has a PhD in Sanskrit; the other has degrees in journalism and biology. (Of course, I have a B.A. in English, so perhaps according to some Iâm unfit to judge the scientific integrity of a work in my mere laymanâs understanding.) However, I donât believe science has all the answers, and the authors point out numerous places where science has perhaps been quite blind. We are called not just to think, but to feelâa more complete way of observing and considering emotions themselves. After all, it is strict adherence to left-brained thinking that justifies everything from vivisection of unanesthetized animals to extermination of entire species.   What I consider important about this book is that it can get the average person to think about how we approach animals and their emotions, and reconsider the practice of anthropomorphization. It may make you angry, it may make you cry, or it may make you nod and say âYes, I agree with thisâ. But as long as youâre thinking about your position on animals as emotional beings instead of just reacting with your usual routines, I think the authors have done their job.

clueweb09-enwp03-21-01537	"                     The Lariat          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search          The Lariat  is a  1927  short novel by the poet and anthropologist  Jaime de Angulo , set in  Spanish California . It is reprinted in Bob Callahan, ed.  A Jaime de Anglo Reader  (Turtle Island Books, 1974).           Contents       1   Plot summary   2   Physical and Cultural Setting   3   Major Characters   4   Other Characters   5   Religious or supernatural content   6   References               [ edit ]   Plot summary   The Lariat  is a story told through a myriad of voices with frequently shifting verb tenses, ultimately dissolving into a patchwork collection of scenes and impressions. Sometimes, we hear the voice of an unknown historian/narrator attempting to piece together the life of protagonist Fray Luis through family records and Luis's own diary entries. At other times the story is told in the present tense, using the voices of talking animals.   Through these voices emerges the story of Fray Luis, a Spanish  Franciscan  monk with a wild secular past, who comes to  Mission Carmel  in Northern California with the goal of converting the local Native Americans to Christianity. The reader learns that the  Esselen  Indians are notoriously difficult to convert. Fray Luis, however, is able to convert a single Esselen girl who voluntarily comes to the Mission, and from her he learns the Esselen language. She was the wife of a  medicine man , Hualala, whom she left after their son died. Ruiz, a  Mestizo   vaquero  associated with the Mission, begins a covert relationship with the Esselen girl, sneaking her out of the nunnery at night. Ruiz makes plans with Mission leader Fray Bernardo to marry the girl, but Fray Luis, who envies Ruiz, does not want this to happen. It is ambiguous whether this is because she is Luis's convert and he claims her spiritually, or whether his sense of spiritual ownership has developed into a sexual desire for her.   Fray Luis goes to Hualala's funeral, where he is involuntarily involved in a ceremony to relieve the Esselen community of the burdon of the death. A mouse takes pity of Fray Luis and attempts to help him, but he refuses to be led by the mouse. Fray Luis ends up living for a few weeks at the house of Esteban, Ruiz's Spanish father. Ruiz decides that he wants to kill the bear that has been eating their cattle, and asks the Mission Indian Saturnino to make him a lariat. Saturnino, who hates Ruiz, uses a piece of Fray Luis's monk's cord to weave a lariat. The lariat looks and feels perfect but its integrity is compromised by the addition of the cord, so it does not work properly when the time comes. Ruiz hunts down the bear with his cousin, Pawi. When Ruiz throws his lariat around the bear, the lariat becomes entangled in the saddle, and while Pawi's arrows bounce off the bear, the bear kills Ruiz.   Fray Luis attempts to leave Mission Carmel on his donkey, but it transforms into a beetle and carries him down a ladder into a ceremonial hut, where a medicine man seems to transform into a bear. As Fray Luis flees back up the ladder that goes out the hole in the center of the hut, he puts his head through the loop of a waiting lariat, and is hung. It is ambiguous whether he was tricked, or has committed suicide.   The narrative is open to interpretation. The chapter titles provide clues, though sometimes they do not seem directly connected to their context (""Fray Luis tries to double-cross the Devil,"" for example). By using information provided in the first chapter to decipher the titles' meanings, the reader can more fully grasp what is taking place in the often confusing final chapters of this text.     [ edit ]   Physical and Cultural Setting          Halfway down the slope, a little flat, with a few Indian huts, and a small house of logs and adobe, with a chimney. Below, a condor is soaring around and around. [ 1 ]                 The Mission was a little town surrounded by a wall. Besides the church, there were the Indian quarters for the unmarried men, the Indian quarters for the girls (also called the nunnery), the pozoleria or kitchen where the mush was cooked in a great cauldron, the carpenter shop, various storerooms. One corner of the great courtyard was occupied by a crew of Indians making adobe bricks, and was known as the adoberia. [ 2 ]          There is a lot of mixing of opposites in this story that is a direct result of the physical and cultural setting: Catholic and Animist practice, Native American and European reminiscent of  Estela Portillo Trambley s The Burning [ 3 ]  which juxtaposes Europe versus the New World, aristocracy and peasantry, light and dark, justice and evil. The reata (or lariat) is functionally compromised when two elements are intertwined: Fray Luiss monks cord and the leather from Saturninos reata. The elements are metaphorically  Catholicism  and  Animism   suggesting that the two cannot function together.     [ edit ]   Major Characters   3.1 Fray Luis:  A Franciscan monk from ""Old Spain"" who ends up at Mission Carmel in California. His job is to help save the ""pagan"" Indians' souls. He speaks Spanish and Sextapay, among other languages. The Mission Indians think he has powers of sorcery.   3.2 Ruiz-Kinikilali Berenda:  This handsome young son of Esteban Berenda is a half-Spanish, half-esselen vaquero. He is skilled at riding horses and throwing the  reata , or lariat. He is killed by a bear who may be a medicine man in disguise.   3.3 Saturnino:  El mayordomo, ""a combination of  sacristan  and Indian chief"" [ 4 ] . He says he is a  Rumsen  Indian, but is most likely a runaway Esselen. He is in charge of the chapel and the nunnery (where the unmarried women stay). He is a  reata -maker who weaves the lariat intended to snare the bear that eventually kills Ruiz.   3.4 Fray Bernardo:  Superior of the  Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo . He is proud ""of the good order, of the prosperousness, of the apparent contentment of the Indians"" [ 5 ]  in his Mission. He speaks Spanish and Rumsen.   3.5 Esselen Girl:  Wife of Hualala and the first Esselen that Fray Luis converts. Luis and Ruiz appear to be in competition for this girl.     [ edit ]   Other Characters   4.1 Pawi-maliay-hapa:  ""Many Arrows,"" cousin and best friend of Ruiz.   4.2 Esteban Berenda:  ""One of the leather-jacketed soldiers who had come with  Captain Portola  on his first voyage of discovery."" [ 6 ]  He is a Spanish settler who lives down the coast. He married an Esselen woman and has one son, Ruiz.   4.3 Amomuths:  The most powerful local ""doctor"" or medicine man. He is Ruiz's great-uncle on his mother's side. He is usually conducting ceremonies in the ceremonial house, where he tells ancient tales. Amomoths comforts Esteban Berenda after Ruiz dies. In the final scenes of Fray Luis's death, Amomuths is the mysterious figure seated before him in the ceremonial house: ""Then it began again, the bear sitting there against the north wall, then Amomuths, then the bear . . ."" [ 7 ]   4.4 Hualala:  He is an Indian medicine man and husband of the Esselen girl.     [ edit ]   Religious or supernatural content   5.1 Nature of the Native American folktale:  Expressions of Native American spirituality in  The Lariat : One of the most important aspects of Native American culture is that it springs from an oral tradition. Not only are the tales and moral precepts passed orally from one generation to the next, but the passing is multi-vocal in nature [ 8 ] . Stories are told and retold, and are influenced by current events as well as by the speaker's interactions with his or her audience.   Native spiritual traditions live in song, story, and ceremony. They live in the experiences of those who bring them into being. They live in the dream-space intensity of personal vision and in the shared cosmic ordering of words and actions that people of knowledge perform in ceremony. Songs, stories, and ceremony have an internal consistency. They represent the way things are. They constitute a language of performance, participation, and experience. They represent the cosmic order within which the world realizes its meaning. [ 9 ]   Because  The Lariat  is presented as a tale of white, Christian encroachment into and entanglement with the world of Native American spirituality, de Angulo, an anthropologist specializing in Native American culture, tells the story within the framework of that native tradition. The work is multivocal, told from multiple viewpoints, and retains the dialogic properties that are the basis of all Native American oral tradition. ""In Native American cultures generally, conversational communicants include all sentient beings; animal persons, the voices of natural places and forces, and the voices of those who have gone before. Coyote may [be] there, too, making fun of it all"" [ 10 ] .     5.2 Magic Realism in  The Lariat : [ 11 ]  It seems that the power of sorcery that Fray Luis has is an element of magic realism. The description of the rope on page 93 seems a lot like the magic realism in Garcia Marquez's  One Hundred Years of Solitude .  The Lariat  does have a  postcolonial  element: the two conflicting cultures are colonizer and colonized. I'm not sure what to call it in this story maybe religious perfection vs. humanness, or, a conflict between goodness and badness in the story. Seems that magical realism meshes the magical and the real at times.  Magical Realism  could explain the arrows bouncing off the bear in the story and other parts where the bear is in the story.   Suzanne Baker in her essay, ""Binarisms and Duality: Magic Realism and  Postcolonialism "" talks about magic realism: ...the central concept of magic realism in literature is its insistence on the co-existence of the magic and the real. While a narrator of the fantastic dispenses with the laws of logic and the physical world and recounts an action which may be absurd or supernatural, a narrator of magic realism accepts most or all of the realistic conventions of fiction but introduces ""something else,"" something which is not realistic, into the text. These elements are not highlighted for shock value, but are woven in seamlessly.""   The point regarding presenting  Magical Realism  in a way that avoids shock value is an important one. Plodding readers, those who are mired in everyday ""reality"" will be shocked or skeptical of talking animals or mice traveling via moonbeam. The more accepting or open-minded reader should not be surprised at such events because, properly presented, the so-called magical elements are everyday events and parts of the natural order.

Your childish heart will not Let you break the chain that bars me from the Path of life, or to The ladder to deathâs door. I cannot be, Your lifeline, or the anchor to your ship, As you keep on sailing,  Ignoring my silent cries. Once I was quite content, just happy to be me, and Not twisted by your vehement and conniving ways, Living in my own world I was Cleansed, daily by the Heat of the sun â Our lives were so simple then, so Filled with pleasure and so sereneâ¦ If you care to rescue my spirit  Listen with care to my silent cries. Take me from your pocket,  No matter how close to your heart  I reside, and unlock the padlock to Deathâs door where we both now stand and Set me free, set me freeâ¦ I, of course, regret the anguish that you feel, But you must always believe that I am not the answer to your plight, And if you  can  understand- Think of how wonderful freedom feels, and That you have been carrying none but A pocket filled with dreams?

This poem fully expresses the longing felt and is truly a work of art! Thank You for sharing it with us.       J   This poem reminded me that men have emotions and doubts, too. It is so easy to forget that. I liked that it ended not knowing if ""she"" came. That wasn't the point. What mattered was the preparation and the building excitment, albiet nervousness, for the special night. It left me hoping for him. and hoping that someday I am ""she."" Beautiful work.       NIBBLES   Did she come? I liked this poem very much and understood that this night was special, but to not know the outcome let me down.       kay   I thought this was a beautiful poem. Keep writting.       Mary   I really like your poem. When you put your feelings on paper, it's remarkable about how others could be feeling the same. I printed your poem. I hope you don't mine. MLC       Cheryl   I was waiting, hoping she would show. But in the end, it didn't say so. I choose to believe she did. It is a beautiful poem.

clueweb09-en0008-66-23442	   Angel poems                   Angel In Your Pocket       I am a tiny angel  I'm smaller than your thumb;  I live in people's pockets  That's where I have my fun.                      I don't suppose you've seen me,  I'm too tiny to detect;  Though I'm with you all the time,  I doubt we've ever met.     Before I was an Angel  I was a fairy in a flower;  God, Himself, hand-picked me,  And gave me angel power.     Now God has many Angels  That He this eyes, and ears, and hands  We become His special tools.    And because God is so busy,  With way too much to do;  He said my assignment  Is to keep close watch on you.    When He tucked me in your pocket  He blessed you with Angel care;  Then told me to never leave you,  And I vowed always to be there.

For all my labour, pains, love Sacrifices, endurance, and resources This stranger has brought dowry And tubers of yam to me Now my girl is gone with him  Gone to be a woman for a man Gone to give this stranger her breasts to get the best Gone to give this man princes and princesses This day she is gone to bear a strange name Of a strange man in a strange land This day my girl publicly declared She has found a new love, home, and life  Till her breath walks out on her This day my girl got married This day my girl is exhanged for a dowry This day I love but this day I cry !

I like letting go of outside commitments with the excuse of weather beyond my control. I like allowing myself to be drawn down from the usual pace into another rhythm -- into that kind of contemplation that feeds on solitude, that might warm to a cup of hot cocoa and lead, perhaps, to poetry. The day reminded me of this poem, which I wrote some time ago. Although it is not exactly a winter poem, it does draw to a close on a winterâs day, perhaps like today. TAO A flutter of blue gingham beneath the eyelids just before sleep, and I walk in my grandmother's house look out the window at the firs freshly planted and low enough to jump. Inside I am warm -- hot cocoa, my wrinkled grandmother wearing her gingham apron, the lingering touch of sheets tucked with care the night before. So small my young spirit, tight as a seed barely sprouted, yet I knew -- like the sure cut of English streets and names -- that my grandmother was old and I, green and growing. Now that silver runs its fingers through my hair even when I do not stand in moonlight I ponder more on mysteries, wonder at the fruit that sleeps in trees -- Feel dancing deep within my heart the unburdened spirit of my grandmother, her strong chi embracing me like an eagle circling her nest. Now she is the tender shoot reaching through another world, the maiden who can see her bridegroom take the rainbow for his bow.* And I, grown old as the firs outside the window, whose strong branches bear the heavy snow and warm the winter birds in their keep. Druzelle Cederquist Published in  World Order Magazine , Vol 31, No.4, Summer 2000  *Reference to a Native American story about a spiritual suitor who could be seen only by a pure-hearted maiden.

I have lived in West Africa and traveled in India, Israel, East Africa, and Europe. I read more nonfiction than fiction. I love the language of poetry and that we are learning the languages of animals. I am intrigued with the science of minds and that brains change with experience. I enjoy discovering how arts, science, and the Baha'i Faith converge in learning about creative process. My own apprenticeship came in the years of writing ""The Story of Baha'u'llah: Promised One of All Relgions,"" a biography of the Founder of the Baha'i Faith.

The unknown follows along our way.                                                If weâre aware and we believe,                                                Beautiful gifts weâll receive.                                                Angels around us everywhere,                                                Showing how much they care.                                                Our eyes may not see                                                Exactly where theyâll be.                                                Â  Angels guard and protect us too,                                                With faith we will know itâs true.                                                Angel wings donât always show,                                                When they travel to and fro.                                                Their love weâll always feel                                                Itâs something very real.                                                We really never need to worry,                                                God sends Angels in a hurry.

That her arms might hold you,                                                And that you feel it too.                                                Sometimes theyâre by your side,                                                But it seems like they hide.                                                Iâll pray that youâre aware,                                                And know how much they care.                                                Iâll pray they softly whisper,                                                The things you need to hear.                                                I hope you feel an Angelsâ caress,                                                And all her tenderness.                                                They leave the sweetest memory,                                                Of how lifeâs suppose to be.                                                Iâll pray that youâre aware,                                                Everyday and everywhere.                                                That an Angelâs love follows you,                                                And walks where you do.

DRSB was published in editions of 10,000 to 20,000 copies, whenever its creator,  Harry Oliver  had sufficient material, and money enough to pay the printer. Forty-six issues were printed and distributed via Southern California bookstores and newsstands, and by mail worldwide. DRSB was devoted to lore, legends, lies and laughs of the  American Southwest  region, especially featuring  prospectors  and other  desert rats . The publication was launched in late 1945 and ran through early 1967. For scans and transcriptions of some issues, see the  Desert Rat Scrap Book archive .

Pages 1 and 5 (the front and back) are about 5.5 x 8.5 inches; page 2 is about 8.5 x 11 inches; page 3 is about 11 x 17 inches; page 5 is the full 17 x 22 inches. See  these images , from the March 1953 issue of  Arizona Highways  magazine, for an illustration of the expansion.     [ edit ]   Numbers   Each issue was a 'packet'; each volume was a 'pouch'. The first issue, dated FALL 1946 (but possibly printed on Harry Oliver's birthday of 4 April 1946) was not numbered. The second issue, dated WINTER 1946-47, was numbered PACKET TWO OF POUCH ONE. All further editions were undated, and numbered as PACKET XXX OF POUCH YYY. Sometimes more than three months passed between editions, which is why PACKET TWO OF POUCH TWELVE (the final issue) appeared in 1967, over 20 years from the first.     [ edit ]   Layout   PAGE ONE , rarely overprinted with one garish color, usually featured a Harry Oliver  woodcut  or a  cartoon  (sometimes by  Walt Disney  or  Hank Ketcham , and would often announce a theme for that issue - see THEMES below. The issue contents might (or might not) generally follow that theme. In just a very few issues, a full-cover illustration would spread over both the first and last pages.   PAGE TWO  would usually (but not always) contain the  masthead  and  boilerplate , something like the following:       This paper is not entered as 2nd class mail.  It's a first class newspaper.  Packet xxx of Pouch yyy  Smallest newspaper in the world  and the only 5 paged one.

Published by  HARRY OLIVER  1888-1999  Fort Commander, Publisher, Distributor, Lamp Lighter, Editor, Artist, Gardener, Janitor, Owner       Following would be an 'editorial', various 'news' items and gags and aphorisms or factoids (original or clipped from other sources) under old-time  fonts  headings, interspersed with small  blockprints  and/or cartoons of desert characters.   PAGE THREE  usually contained more of the same, with some slightly longer text pieces, by Harry Oliver or other writers. Many of these items were recycled from previous Harry Oliver publications -- Harry was his own best plagiarist.   PAGE FOUR  had yet more of the same, often with even longer pieces (including a complete play once) that might address the issue's theme. Along the bottom of this largest page might be a few advertisements, for ghost towns and publications and date farms and rock shops.   PAGE FIVE , above the mailing address block, might contain a list of conversation starters, or more gags and news and quotes, or a promotion for Harry Oliver's album of readings, or maybe just a large woodcut and an essay or mini-epic poem.   Just one issue, Packet Four of Pouch Four, named  DESERT RAT HARRY OLIVER'S JOKE BOOK , did not follow the above formats. This is a 32-page book (plus covers), sized about 5.5 x 8.5 inches, folded and stapled. The contents are primarily the usual short gags. The heading on page one says FIRST DESERT JOKE BOOK. This was apparently an unsuccessful experiment.     [ edit ]   Impact     [ edit ]   Themes   Each issue bore on the front cover the name of a supposed theme for that issue, such as: Desert Burros,  Death Valley , Good Old Desert Fun,  Ghost Towns , Along The Border, Simplicity,  Indians , Desert Folklore,  Peg-Leg Smith 's Gold,  Lost Mines  And  Buried Treasure , Frontier  Wild Women ,  Desert Rats  &  Hermits ,  Death Valley Scotty , etc. Besides these, Harry Oliver would also deal with such themes as: The  Lost Ship of the Desert ; his  Desert County   seccession  movement and  Keep the Desert Beautiful  campaign;  outlaws  and  lawmen ; communicating with animals; and what others had written about him.     [ edit ]   Ambiance   The above descriptions do nothing to convey the ambiance and attraction of the Desert Rat Scrap Book. It's like holding a booklet that becomes an old-time news sheet, filled with information old and new, real and imaginary, serious and hilarious, all informed by a strong and cantankerous personality. There's always another detail in another corner, another timeless tidbit waiting for a patient reader to stumble upon. Even when new, each issue is a small  time machine .     [ edit ]   Influence   Just as  Harry Oliver 's design of  Gold Gulch , at the  San Diego   World's Fair  ( California Pacific International Exposition ) of 1935-36, strongly influenced the development of Western  theme parks  and frontier village reconstructions, so his DRSB can be seen to help shape subsequent Western Americana  literary   ephemera . The DRSB can also be seen as an ancestor of  zine  culture     [ edit ]   Issues     [ edit ]   Dating   Dating any specific issue has always been problematic. Postmarks on mailed issues are not always helpful. Harry Oliver produced all issues ('packets') of the first 11 pouches, often at very irregular intervals. Later issues depended heavily on reprinted items. Due to failing health and attitude, Oliver ceased publication in 1965. In 1967 he gave his operation to ex- merchant seaman  Bill Powers, who produced two more issues (Packets One and Two of Pouch Twelve) and reprinted a few old issues, then abandoned the DRSB forever and disappeared, possibly returning to sea.   First packet was printed on 4 April 1946.  Packet 4, Pouch 5, printed on 4 April 1953.

clueweb09-enwp00-40-23375	"                     Desert Rat Scrap Book          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia      Â Â (Redirected from  Desert Rat Scrapbook )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search                 Desert Rat Scrap Book       The  Desert Rat Scrap Book  (or  DRSB ) was a (roughly) quarterly, southwestern humor publication based in Thousand Palms, California. DRSB was published in editions of 10,000 to 20,000 copies, whenever its creator,  Harry Oliver  had sufficient material, and money enough to pay the printer. Forty-six issues were printed and distributed via Southern California bookstores and newsstands, and by mail worldwide. DRSB was devoted to lore, legends, lies and laughs of the  American Southwest  region, especially featuring  prospectors  and other  desert rats . The publication was launched in late 1945 and ran through early 1967. For scans and transcriptions of some issues, see the  Desert Rat Scrap Book archive .           Contents       1   Structure     1.1   Format   1.2   Numbers   1.3   Layout       2   Impact     2.1   Themes   2.2   Ambiance   2.3   Influence       3   Issues     3.1   Dating   3.2   Contents       4   References     4.1   External links   4.2   See also                   [ edit ]   Structure     [ edit ]   Format   The DRSB was published in a unique format, printed on both sides of heavy creme-colored stock of about 17 x 22 inches (43.3 x 55.5 centimetres) ( Demy )  paper size , folded double three times to yield ""the smallest newspaper in the world and the only 5-page one... only newspaper in America you can open in the wind."" Pages 1 and 5 (the front and back) are about 5.5 x 8.5 inches; page 2 is about 8.5 x 11 inches; page 3 is about 11 x 17 inches; page 5 is the full 17 x 22 inches. See  these images , from the March 1953 issue of  Arizona Highways  magazine, for an illustration of the expansion.     [ edit ]   Numbers   Each issue was a 'packet'; each volume was a 'pouch'. The first issue, dated FALL 1946 (but possibly printed on Harry Oliver's birthday of 4 April 1946) was not numbered. The second issue, dated WINTER 1946-47, was numbered PACKET TWO OF POUCH ONE. All further editions were undated, and numbered as PACKET XXX OF POUCH YYY. Sometimes more than three months passed between editions, which is why PACKET TWO OF POUCH TWELVE (the final issue) appeared in 1967, over 20 years from the first.     [ edit ]   Layout   PAGE ONE , rarely overprinted with one garish color, usually featured a Harry Oliver  woodcut  or a  cartoon  (sometimes by  Walt Disney  or  Hank Ketcham , and would often announce a theme for that issue - see THEMES below. The issue contents might (or might not) generally follow that theme. In just a very few issues, a full-cover illustration would spread over both the first and last pages.   PAGE TWO  would usually (but not always) contain the  masthead  and  boilerplate , something like the following:       This paper is not entered as 2nd class mail.  It's a first class newspaper.  Packet xxx of Pouch yyy  Smallest newspaper in the world  and the only 5 paged one.  Published at Fort Oliver  1000 Palms, California  Four Times a Year  ON THE NEWS STANDS 10 A COPY  But sometimes they don't have them.

Published by  HARRY OLIVER  1888-1999  Fort Commander, Publisher, Distributor, Lamp Lighter, Editor, Artist, Gardener, Janitor, Owner       Following would be an 'editorial', various 'news' items and gags and aphorisms or factoids (original or clipped from other sources) under old-time  fonts  headings, interspersed with small  blockprints  and/or cartoons of desert characters.   PAGE THREE  usually contained more of the same, with some slightly longer text pieces, by Harry Oliver or other writers. Many of these items were recycled from previous Harry Oliver publications -- Harry was his own best plagiarist.   PAGE FOUR  had yet more of the same, often with even longer pieces (including a complete play once) that might address the issue's theme. Along the bottom of this largest page might be a few advertisements, for ghost towns and publications and date farms and rock shops.   PAGE FIVE , above the mailing address block, might contain a list of conversation starters, or more gags and news and quotes, or a promotion for Harry Oliver's album of readings, or maybe just a large woodcut and an essay or mini-epic poem.   Just one issue, Packet Four of Pouch Four, named  DESERT RAT HARRY OLIVER'S JOKE BOOK , did not follow the above formats. This is a 32-page book (plus covers), sized about 5.5 x 8.5 inches, folded and stapled. The contents are primarily the usual short gags. The heading on page one says FIRST DESERT JOKE BOOK. This was apparently an unsuccessful experiment.     [ edit ]   Impact     [ edit ]   Themes   Each issue bore on the front cover the name of a supposed theme for that issue, such as: Desert Burros,  Death Valley , Good Old Desert Fun,  Ghost Towns , Along The Border, Simplicity,  Indians , Desert Folklore,  Peg-Leg Smith 's Gold,  Lost Mines  And  Buried Treasure , Frontier  Wild Women ,  Desert Rats  &  Hermits ,  Death Valley Scotty , etc. Besides these, Harry Oliver would also deal with such themes as: The  Lost Ship of the Desert ; his  Desert County   seccession  movement and  Keep the Desert Beautiful  campaign;  outlaws  and  lawmen ; communicating with animals; and what others had written about him.     [ edit ]   Ambiance   The above descriptions do nothing to convey the ambiance and attraction of the Desert Rat Scrap Book. It's like holding a booklet that becomes an old-time news sheet, filled with information old and new, real and imaginary, serious and hilarious, all informed by a strong and cantankerous personality. There's always another detail in another corner, another timeless tidbit waiting for a patient reader to stumble upon. Even when new, each issue is a small  time machine .     [ edit ]   Influence   Just as  Harry Oliver 's design of  Gold Gulch , at the  San Diego   World's Fair  ( California Pacific International Exposition ) of 1935-36, strongly influenced the development of Western  theme parks  and frontier village reconstructions, so his DRSB can be seen to help shape subsequent Western Americana  literary   ephemera . The DRSB can also be seen as an ancestor of  zine  culture     [ edit ]   Issues     [ edit ]   Dating   Dating any specific issue has always been problematic. Postmarks on mailed issues are not always helpful. Harry Oliver produced all issues ('packets') of the first 11 pouches, often at very irregular intervals. Later issues depended heavily on reprinted items. Due to failing health and attitude, Oliver ceased publication in 1965. In 1967 he gave his operation to ex- merchant seaman  Bill Powers, who produced two more issues (Packets One and Two of Pouch Twelve) and reprinted a few old issues, then abandoned the DRSB forever and disappeared, possibly returning to sea.   First packet was printed on 4 April 1946.  Packet 4, Pouch 5, printed on 4 April 1953.  (timeline needed here)     [ edit ]   Contents   NOTE:  Â  Following is a necessarily incomplete summary of DRSB 'articles'. This list may merely give a taste of the fractally-complex contents of each issue. Unless credited otherwise, text and art are presumably by Harry Oliver.

clueweb09-enwp00-59-19900	"                     Desert Rat Scrap Book          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia      Â Â (Redirected from  DRSB )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search                 Desert Rat Scrap Book       The  Desert Rat Scrap Book  (or  DRSB ) was a (roughly) quarterly, southwestern humor publication based in Thousand Palms, California. DRSB was published in editions of 10,000 to 20,000 copies, whenever its creator,  Harry Oliver  had sufficient material, and money enough to pay the printer. Forty-six issues were printed and distributed via Southern California bookstores and newsstands, and by mail worldwide. DRSB was devoted to lore, legends, lies and laughs of the  American Southwest  region, especially featuring  prospectors  and other  desert rats . The publication was launched in late 1945 and ran through early 1967. For scans and transcriptions of some issues, see the  Desert Rat Scrap Book archive .           Contents       1   Structure     1.1   Format   1.2   Numbers   1.3   Layout       2   Impact     2.1   Themes   2.2   Ambiance   2.3   Influence       3   Issues     3.1   Dating   3.2   Contents       4   References     4.1   External links   4.2   See also                   [ edit ]   Structure     [ edit ]   Format   The DRSB was published in a unique format, printed on both sides of heavy creme-colored stock of about 17 x 22 inches (43.3 x 55.5 centimetres) ( Demy )  paper size , folded double three times to yield ""the smallest newspaper in the world and the only 5-page one... only newspaper in America you can open in the wind."" Pages 1 and 5 (the front and back) are about 5.5 x 8.5 inches; page 2 is about 8.5 x 11 inches; page 3 is about 11 x 17 inches; page 5 is the full 17 x 22 inches. See  these images , from the March 1953 issue of  Arizona Highways  magazine, for an illustration of the expansion.     [ edit ]   Numbers   Each issue was a 'packet'; each volume was a 'pouch'. The first issue, dated FALL 1946 (but possibly printed on Harry Oliver's birthday of 4 April 1946) was not numbered. The second issue, dated WINTER 1946-47, was numbered PACKET TWO OF POUCH ONE. All further editions were undated, and numbered as PACKET XXX OF POUCH YYY. Sometimes more than three months passed between editions, which is why PACKET TWO OF POUCH TWELVE (the final issue) appeared in 1967, over 20 years from the first.     [ edit ]   Layout   PAGE ONE , rarely overprinted with one garish color, usually featured a Harry Oliver  woodcut  or a  cartoon  (sometimes by  Walt Disney  or  Hank Ketcham , and would often announce a theme for that issue - see THEMES below. The issue contents might (or might not) generally follow that theme. In just a very few issues, a full-cover illustration would spread over both the first and last pages.   PAGE TWO  would usually (but not always) contain the  masthead  and  boilerplate , something like the following:       This paper is not entered as 2nd class mail.  It's a first class newspaper.  Packet xxx of Pouch yyy  Smallest newspaper in the world  and the only 5 paged one.

Published by  HARRY OLIVER  1888-1999  Fort Commander, Publisher, Distributor, Lamp Lighter, Editor, Artist, Gardener, Janitor, Owner       Following would be an 'editorial', various 'news' items and gags and aphorisms or factoids (original or clipped from other sources) under old-time  fonts  headings, interspersed with small  blockprints  and/or cartoons of desert characters.   PAGE THREE  usually contained more of the same, with some slightly longer text pieces, by Harry Oliver or other writers. Many of these items were recycled from previous Harry Oliver publications -- Harry was his own best plagiarist.   PAGE FOUR  had yet more of the same, often with even longer pieces (including a complete play once) that might address the issue's theme. Along the bottom of this largest page might be a few advertisements, for ghost towns and publications and date farms and rock shops.   PAGE FIVE , above the mailing address block, might contain a list of conversation starters, or more gags and news and quotes, or a promotion for Harry Oliver's album of readings, or maybe just a large woodcut and an essay or mini-epic poem.   Just one issue, Packet Four of Pouch Four, named  DESERT RAT HARRY OLIVER'S JOKE BOOK , did not follow the above formats. This is a 32-page book (plus covers), sized about 5.5 x 8.5 inches, folded and stapled. The contents are primarily the usual short gags. The heading on page one says FIRST DESERT JOKE BOOK. This was apparently an unsuccessful experiment.     [ edit ]   Impact     [ edit ]   Themes   Each issue bore on the front cover the name of a supposed theme for that issue, such as: Desert Burros,  Death Valley , Good Old Desert Fun,  Ghost Towns , Along The Border, Simplicity,  Indians , Desert Folklore,  Peg-Leg Smith 's Gold,  Lost Mines  And  Buried Treasure , Frontier  Wild Women ,  Desert Rats  &  Hermits ,  Death Valley Scotty , etc. Besides these, Harry Oliver would also deal with such themes as: The  Lost Ship of the Desert ; his  Desert County   seccession  movement and  Keep the Desert Beautiful  campaign;  outlaws  and  lawmen ; communicating with animals; and what others had written about him.     [ edit ]   Ambiance   The above descriptions do nothing to convey the ambiance and attraction of the Desert Rat Scrap Book. It's like holding a booklet that becomes an old-time news sheet, filled with information old and new, real and imaginary, serious and hilarious, all informed by a strong and cantankerous personality. There's always another detail in another corner, another timeless tidbit waiting for a patient reader to stumble upon. Even when new, each issue is a small  time machine .     [ edit ]   Influence   Just as  Harry Oliver 's design of  Gold Gulch , at the  San Diego   World's Fair  ( California Pacific International Exposition ) of 1935-36, strongly influenced the development of Western  theme parks  and frontier village reconstructions, so his DRSB can be seen to help shape subsequent Western Americana  literary   ephemera . The DRSB can also be seen as an ancestor of  zine  culture     [ edit ]   Issues     [ edit ]   Dating   Dating any specific issue has always been problematic. Postmarks on mailed issues are not always helpful. Harry Oliver produced all issues ('packets') of the first 11 pouches, often at very irregular intervals. Later issues depended heavily on reprinted items. Due to failing health and attitude, Oliver ceased publication in 1965. In 1967 he gave his operation to ex- merchant seaman  Bill Powers, who produced two more issues (Packets One and Two of Pouch Twelve) and reprinted a few old issues, then abandoned the DRSB forever and disappeared, possibly returning to sea.   First packet was printed on 4 April 1946.  Packet 4, Pouch 5, printed on 4 April 1953.  (timeline needed here)     [ edit ]   Contents   NOTE:  Â  Following is a necessarily incomplete summary of DRSB 'articles'. This list may merely give a taste of the fractally-complex contents of each issue. Unless credited otherwise, text and art are presumably by Harry Oliver.

The Girl Who Married a Ghost . New York, NY: Macmillan Child Group; 1984. 113 pages. (elementary/secondary).         This collection contains nine of the 350 tales collected by photographer Edward S.   Curtis (1868--1952). These tales represent sacred origin stories, ghost stories, trickster   tales, and non-sacred campfire tales. The book is organized by geographic area---Plains,   Northwest Coast, and California---each with a short introduction. The book is illustrated   with Curtis' photographs. Curtis has been criticized for ""staging"" his subjects,   creating culturally inaccurate portraits. Bierhorst has edited these tales into simple,   easy prose.       Burland, Cottie; Revised by Marion Wood.  North American Indian Mythology . Revised 1965 ed. New York, NY: Peter Bedrick Books; 1985. 144 pages. (The Library of the World's Myths and Legends). (secondary).         This is a profusely illustrated survey of American Indian mythology. The introduction   discusses the origins of North American Indians with brief descriptions of traditional   culture of the various geographic areas. Other sections relate traditional stories from   the Inuit, Cree, Navajo, Pueblos, and peoples of the Northwest Coast, the Plains, and the   Southeast. The final section briefly discusses the impact of European contact on   traditional cultures. Not a useful source for information on the continuing influence of   oral history and traditional literature on the lives of contemporary Indian people.   Includes a list of ""Chief Gods and Spirits of North America,"" a reading list and   an index. The book is illustrated with black-and-white and color photographs and   illustrations; among these are drawings of false-face masks and sand paintings--- items   that are sacred to their respective cultures---and it is often considered disrespectful to   publish images of this type of material culture.       Clark, Ella C.  Indian Legends from the Northern Rockies . Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press; 1966. 350 pages. (Civilization of the American Indian; v. 82). (secondary).         Original sources are cited in this collection of 121 traditional stories, personal   narratives, and historical traditions from thirteen tribes of the Northern Rockies. The   stories are arranged by language group, each section preceded by a brief historical note   on the tribes represented. This valuable, clearly written resource includes source notes,   a bibliography, and an index.       Connolly, James E., comp; Adams, Andrea, illus.  Why the Possum's Tail is Bare and Other North American Indian Nature Tales . Owings Mills, MD: Stemmer House; 1985. 64 pages. (upper elementary) *.         Sources are cited for these thirteen animal legends collected from eight tribes. The   introduction provides a brief overview of the lifeways of the eight tribes represented,   and each story is preceded by a paragraph discussing some of the characteristics of the   animals and supernatural beings in the tales. The language of the stories is simple and   accessible for young readers. Appealing, realistic drawings.       Gilmore, Melvin; Schellback, Louis, illus.  Prairie Smoke . Re-edition of 1920 Columbia University Press ed. St. Paul, MN: Minnesota Historical Society Press; 1987. 225 pages. (secondary).         The ethnobotanist author intended this book (first published in 1929) to be an   introduction to the ecology and culture of the Plains. The major part of the book consists   of traditional tales about plants, animals, and people. These are interwoven with   discussions of such topics as how Indians made paints and the meaning of personal names in   Plains Indian society. The American Indian ""caretaker"" approach to nature is   contrasted with a destructive, manipulative attitude of non-Indians. Includes a   bibliography and an index.      Goble, Paul; Goble, Paul, illus.  Buffalo Woman . New York, NY: Macmillan Publishing Company; 1984. 28 pages. (elementary).         This Plains legend explains how buffalo and people are related, and the importance of   the buffalo as a source of life. A young hunter marries a female buffalo in the form of a   woman. When his people reject her, she returns to the Buffalo Nation with their son. The   hunter follows but must pass tests to become a member of the Buffalo People. The author   explains that telling these stories ""had power to strengthen the bond with herds, and   to encourage the herds to continue to give themselves so that the people could live.""   Beautifully illustrated.       Goble, Paul; Goble, Paul, illus.  Crow Chief . New York, NY: Orchard Books; 1992. 27 pages. (elementary) *.         Falling Star, the Savior, shows Plains Indian hunters how to outwit Crow, whose loud   calls frightened the buffalo away, leaving the people hungry. This charming and   beautifully illustrated Plains legend explains how crow's feathers turned from white to   black as a reminder from the Creator to share and live together like relatives. Sources   for the story are cited and an author's note describes buffalo hunting prior to the   introduction of the horse.       Monroe, Jean Guard; Williamson, Ray A.; Carlson, Susan Johnston, illus.  First Houses: Native American Homes and Sacred Structures . Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin Company; 1993. 147 pages. (upper elementary/secondary).         This is a collection of legends associated with American Indian houses and sacred   structures from the temperate zone of North America. Stories about the Plains tipi,   Iroquois longhouse, Navajo hogan, and a variety of other house types show how the patterns   for these ancient dwellings set the pattern for homes of today. Most of the stories were   collected directly from Indian storytellers and were originally published in scholarly   books and journals ""reduced to lifeless prose."" The authors have presented the   stories here ""in a form that we hope conveys more of the liveliness of the original   telling.""       Monroe, Jean Guard; Williamson, Ray A.; Sturat, Edgar, illus.  They Dance in the Sky: Native American Star Myths . Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin; 1987. 118 pages. (upper elementary/secondary) *.         This book is a well-documented presentation of American Indian star stories. The first   two chapters compare various legends about the Pleiades and the Big Dipper. The rest of   the book is arranged by tribe or region--Southwest, Pawnee, Plains, California, Northwest   Coast, Southeast. An introductory paragraph to each story provides a brief outline of the   tribe's history. Where available, explanations are suggested as to how events described in   the stories might relate to the seasonal movement of the stars. A bibliography provides   sources (generally scholarly papers) for each story presented. The preface notes that   legends reinforced behavioral standards for the people. It also explains that the stories   are meant to be read aloud, since a certain quality is lost when an oral text is set down   in print. Black-and-white drawings. Includes an index and a glossary with a pronunciation   guide.       PLAINS NON-FICTION     Ashabranner, Brent.  A Strange and Distant Shore: Indians of the Great Plains in Exile . Cobblehill Books/Dutton, 1996. 54 pp. (secondary) *.    This moving and captivating story describes the violent conflicts between the Indians and the white people; the U.S. Army's forced removal of the Plains Indians onto reservations far from their homelands; and the exile of 72 chiefs and warriors, considered dangerous, to Fort Marion in St. Augustine, Florida. At Fort Marion the prisoners expressed their despair from being separated from their home and family through drawings of their traditional life, which came to represent a new and sought after form of Indian art. When their confinement was over, some Indians returned to the reservation while others attended school, first at Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute in Virginia and then to the newly established Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania. Illustrated with black and white photographs, some historic, and color photographs of Indian art. Contains a bibliography and index.     Bains, Rae; Baxter, Robert, illus.  Indians of the Plains . Mahwah, NJ: Troll Associates; 1985. 30 pages. (lower elementary) ?.         This book focuses on traditional Plains Indian ceremonies and material   culture---housing, clothing, decoration---while it lacks information on family life,   social organization, and the sacred significance of the ceremonies. The effects of the   horse, the railroad, and the extermination of the buffalo are described, but the   devastation brought on by European-introduced diseases is not mentioned. Contemporary life   is not covered. Text and illustrations are simplistic and stereotypical.       Boiteau, Denise; Stansfield, David.  Early Peoples: A History of Canada . Markham, Ontario, Canada: Fitzhenry & Whiteside Ltd.; 1988. 64 pages. (upper elementary) *.         Based on the first three programs of the Canadian television series,   ""Origins,"" which explores the history of the peoples of Canada up to 1885, this   book is divided into three chapters: ""A New World""; ""The First   Nations""; and ""Lost Civilizations."" Each chapter includes several units   that begin with questions to consider and ends with creative research activities and   discussion questions. This book clearly explains the difference between evolution and   creation, and asserts that these theories do not oppose one another.       Brandt, Keith; Guzzi, George, illus.  Indian Homes . Mahwah, NJ: Troll Associates; 1985. 30 pages. (lower elementary).         This book describes the house types of various regions (Plains, Woodlands, Southeast,   Southwest) and the factors that influenced the types of housing: climate, building   materials, length of time dwelling was used, tribal customs, and lifeways. There is no   discussion on contemporary housing nor the roles of the above factors for Indians today.   The book contains generalizations such as: ""A belief shared by all tribes   was....""       Brandt, Keith; Guzzi, George, illus.  Indian Festivals . Mahwah, NJ: Troll Associates; 1985. 30 pages. (lower elementary) ?.         This book gives brief descriptions of the festivals held by American Indians in the   Eastern Woodlands (Iroquois, Algonquian), Southeast (Muskogee), Plains, Southwest   (Pueblo), California, and Northwest Coast regions. The book uses the word   ""braves"" and includes generalizations and stereotypes about Native peoples, such   as ""The Indians who lived in California did not hunt or farm. They lived entirely on   acorns that were gathered from trees. But while their lives were easy and peaceful, their   festivals were almost totally concerned with death.""       Brown, Vinson; Shearer, Tony (Sioux), illus.  Voices of Earth and Sky, the Vision Life of the Native Americans and their Culture Heroes . Harrisburg, PA: Naturegraph; 1976. 177 pages.(secondary) ?.         This book describes the author's frankly personal perspective on American Indian   beliefs such as the relationship between subsistence and religion and learning to   understand and reach the spirit. He states: ""If we dig deep enough to find the   eternal power of the spirit that is within us, we can find the strength to learn from our   mistakes and finally overcome them."" Chapters 5--10 deal with American Indian culture   heroes. Subsequent chapters concern a Sioux youth's vision quest; the visions of Black   Elk, Wishram, and Crazy Horse; and the author's personal vision quest experience. The   final chapter is an imaginary conversation between Quetzalcoatl and King Arthur.   Introduced along the way are such topics as Aikido-dynamic relaxation, and a discussion of   the ""outsider"" scientific approach of anthropologists versus that of the author,   who attempts to understand through personal experience. It is doubtful this personal   account by a non-Indian provides reliable cultural information.       Brown, Dee.  Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West . New York, NY: Holt & Co.; 1991; c1970. 512 pages. (secondary) *.         The Western tribes' displacement from their lands, confinement to reservations, and the   consequent destruction of traditional culture are carefully and compassionately recounted   in this compelling and highly readable history (1860--1890). Unlike most other histories   covering this topic, the book presents the events as experienced by the victims. The main   sources for the history are official records of U.S.-Indian treaty councils and meetings.   The reasonableness and humanity expressed by the American Indian spokesmen during these   encounters, as recounted here, do much to counter the stereotype of ""ignorant""   or ""savage"" Indians, and the courageous spirit they reveal evokes admiration and   respect. Chapters are arranged chronologically, each devoted to a particular tribe or   campaign. The final chapter describes the growth and significance of the Ghost Dance   movement and the Battle of Wounded Knee. A map shows the location and dates of the main   actions. Sources are cited in the extensive notes. Archival photographs, bibliography and   index are included.       Brown, Dee. Erlich, Amy, adapter.  Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West . New York, NY. Henry Holt & Co.; 1993; c. 1970, 1974. 202 pages * (upper elementary/secondary).         This adaptation for young readers of  Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee  tells the   moving story of the defeat and dispossession of the Western tribes, 1860--1890, ending   with the Battle of Wounded Knee. Dee Brown's account of these events, told from the   viewpoint of the victims, has been successfully translated into a simpler, abbreviated   version that retains the powerful impact of the original.

(The Civilization Library). (upper elementary/secondary).        This succinctly presented account of Plains Indian life, focusing on anthropological   rather than historical aspects, covers subsistence, family life, housing, raiding, and the   Sun Dance. A section on contemporary life is included. Good full-color illustrations.       Engel, Lorenz.  Among the Plains Indians . Reprint of 1970 ed. Minneapolis, MN: Lerner Publications Company; 1978. 107 pages. (Nature and Man). (secondary).         This is an account of a fictional expedition based on information gathered during the   travels of Prince Maximilian and George Catlin along the Missouri River during the 1830s.   Each brief section is illustrated with a painting by George Catlin or Karl Bodmer.   Included are episodes among several American Indian tribes---the Sioux, Mandan, Crow, and   Blackfoot. Incidents described include various dances and ceremonies, hunting, game   playing, warfare, and other traditional activities. Includes an index and a section on   tribes and language families.       Fichter, George S.; Farquharson, Alexander, illus.  How the Plains Indians Lived . New York, NY: David McKay Company, Inc.; 1980. 121 pages. (upper elementary/secondary) ?.         This book describes the pre-Contact lifeways of Plains Indians. Short paragraphs give   information on the principal tribes followed by chapters with titles such as ""Tepee   Towns,"" The Best-Dressed Indian,"" and ""Gone, like the Buffalo.""   Contains some inaccurate information. For example, the author incorrectly describes the   meaning of the Ghost Dance: ""...all Indians must learn to live at peace with the   whites and to forget forever their old ways."" Illustrated with black-and-white   drawings. Includes a bibliography.       Freedman, Russell.  Buffalo Hunt . New York, NY: Holiday House; 1988. 52 pages. (upper elementary/ secondary).         This well-researched and well-written book examines the importance of the buffalo in   the daily life and lore of the various Plains tribes and the complexities of trade with   European settlers. The book is illustrated with reproductions of turn-of-the-century   paintings and drawings by such artists as George Catlin and Karl Bodmer. The book's ending   perpetuates the myth that Plains Indians have disappeared.       Goble, Paul; Goble, Paul, illus.  Beyond The Ridge . New York, NY: Bradbury Press; 1989. 27 pages. (lower elementary).         This sensitive treatment of death and the afterlife is based on a Plains Indian view of   the Spirit World, a fertile and beautiful land of buffalo, birds, and butterflies. The   author/illustrator cites sources for the ideas presented and the material culture   depicted. Contains full-color illustrations.       Goble, Paul; Goble, Paul, illus.  Brave Eagle's Account of The Fetterman Fight . Reprint of 1972 Pantheon ed. Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press; 1992. 60 pages. (elementary) *.         This is an account of the U. S. Army's failed attempt to protect the Bozeman trail for   white gold miners against the powerful Sioux and Cheyenne, who were determined to prohibit   use of the trail because it passed through some of their best hunting grounds. Led by Red   Cloud, war chief of the Oglala Sioux, the Indians killed 82 soldiers in what was, up until   that time, the Army's worst defeat by the Indians. The author presents the story of this   confrontation from the Indian perspective by drawing on the published Indian accounts and   extracting Red Cloud's words from his recorded speeches. A background section and   conclusion are helpful in providing context for the story. Full-color illustrations.       Goble, Paul; Goble, Paul, illus.  Red Hawk's Account of Custer's Last Battle: The Battle of the Little Bighorn 25 June 1876 . Reprint of 1969 ed. Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press; 1992. 59 pages. (elementary).         This is an account of the 1876 Battle of Little Bighorn in which General Custer and his   men were overcome by the Sioux and Cheyenne. The author notes that ""Red Hawk is not a   real person, his `account' is based on the published statements of both Sioux and Cheyenne   participants in the Battle of Little Bighorn."" Beautiful color illustrations.       Grisham, Noel; Warren, Betsy, illus.  Buffalo and Indians on the Great Plains . Austin, TX: Eakin Press; 1985. 36 pages. (elementary).         This is a simply written description of the importance of the buffalo to Plains   Indians. The book explains how buffalo were hunted before and after the introduction of   the horse; their uses for food, housing, clothes, and ornaments; the significance of the   white buffalo; and the meaning of the buffalo dance. The last page incorrectly implies   that both the buffalo and the Indians' oral traditions are extinct. Illustrated with   black, white, and red drawings. Includes ""some words to know"" and a short   bibliography.       Hall, A. Joan; Hall, Kenneth M.; Worthington, J. Stanley.  Indians of the Plains . Vancouver, BC: Fitzhenry & Whiteside Limited; 1972. 64 pages. (upper elementary).         Short chapters on traditional Plains Indian life (for example, the horse, clothing,   warfare, dances and ceremonies) are interspersed in a fictionalized account of a   contemporary Canadian family's trip to the Calgary Stampede, an annual rodeo. The young   Canadian boy Paul becomes friends with a Blackfoot boy named Johnny and their relationship   is used as a vehicle for conveying information about Plains history and culture. Each   chapter contains suggested activities or questions for discussion, some of which seem   inappropriate or without clear purpose. For example, the suggested activity following   Johnny's retelling of a Blackfoot story heard from his grandfather is ""Rewrite this   story giving it an exciting but different ending."" Following a drawing of a Plains   Indian on horseback, apparently ready to ride into battle, the suggested activity is   ""Imagine that you had actually seen an Indian similar to the one in the sketch. Write   a letter to a friend describing what you saw."" Illustrated with two-tone drawings and   archival photographs.       Hofsinde, Robert (Gray-Wolf); Gray-Wolf, illus.  Indian Costumes . New York, NY: William Morrow and Company; 1968. 94 pages. (upper elementary).         This simple reference on the traditional dress of various American Indian tribes makes   distinctions between clothing used for everyday purposes, warfare, and ceremonial   occasions. While the author uses the word ""costume,"" more appropriate would be   the terms ""clothing,"" ""dress,"" and ""regalia."" Stereotypical   Indian dress is a popular ""costume"" for Halloween and western movies. Includes   detailed black-and-white illustrations.       Hofsinde, Robert; Hofsinde, Robert, illus.  Indian Warriors and their Weapons . New York, NY: William Morrow & Co.; 1965. 96 pages. (upper elementary).         The weapons, fighting methods, clothing, and charms worn for battle of seven   representative tribes---the Ojibwa, Iroquois, Sioux, Blackfeet, Apache, Navajo, and   Crow---are the focus of this book. There is very little discussion of the causes for   warfare, or the historical context in which wars were fought. Illustrated with   black-and-white ink drawings of traditional dress and weapons.       Hook, Jason; Hook, Richard, illus.  The American Plains Indians . Reprint of 1985 ed. London, England: Osprey Publishing Limited; 1991. 47 pages. (Windrow, Martin, Men-at-Arms Series). (secondary).         Though part of a series devoted to warfare, this volume also covers the ecology of the   Plains, buffalo hunting techniques, and the many products obtained from the buffalo.   Housing, social organization (particularly warrior societies), religion, ceremony,   medicine, and the vision quest are also covered. The introduction notes that information   is presented in a generalized form but indicates that differences exist among the Plains   tribes. The topic of Indian-white warfare is not included, though the effect of the horse   and firearms on warfare among Indian tribes is discussed, and pre- and post-horse war   customs are compared. This fact-filled book resembles a textbook and would serve as a good   reference, although some of the language is outdated and inappropriate; e.g.   ""brave,"" ""the red man,"" and ""costume.""

Minneapolis, MN: Lerner Publications Company; 1973; Vol. I. 104 pages. (The In America Series). (secondary).         This is a comprehensive overview of the history and lifeways of the American Indian   from pre-Contact to the late 1800s. A detailed introduction explains the term   ""prehistory"" and what is known of paleo-Indians from research and archaeological   findings on the North American continent. Subsequent sections describe subsistence areas,   including the Arctic, the Northwest Coast, and the Great Plains. The final section   describes conflicts between Indians and white settlers during the colonial period.   Illustrated with black-and-white photographs, drawings, and maps. Includes an index and   additional information on tribes and language families.       MacDonald, Fiona; Smith, Sharon, and Townsend, Sally, illus.  Plains Indians . Hauppanage, NY.: Barrons; 1992 (Quarto Publications, London, Great Britain). 57 pages. (upper elementary).         This is a brief overview of traditional Plains life and the changes caused by the   arrival of whites and the introduction of the horse, trade goods, guns, disease, and   alcohol. Subsequent events---the American Indian wars, removal to reservations, and life   for American Indians today---are mentioned only briefly. Two- to three-page sections on   topics such as ""Nations and Chiefs"" and ""Family Life,"" along with   insets on specific items and lift-up flaps showing ""before and after"" effects,   convey a lot of information. The book was written for British children, so some topics   that may be familiar with American children, seem over-explained, as when a buffalo is   described as ""a strong, hairy animal like a large cow."" Non-Indian readers may   be surprised at illustrations of holdings in American archives (photographs, newspaper   articles, letters and government reports) classified as ""Enemy Evidence.""   Contains color illustrations, archival photographs, and maps. A Plains Time Chart for   1700-1950 lists major events worldwide. Includes a glossary and an index.       Marrin, Albert.  War Clouds in the West: Indians and Cavalrymen 1860--1890 . New York: Atheneum; 1984. 220 pages. (upper elementary).         As the title indicates, this book focuses on military actions in the U.S.-Indian wars   in the American West (1860--90). The first chapter discusses traditional Plains lifeways,   with much of the focus on men's activities. Subsequent chapters describe U.S. attacks on   the Cheyenne, Sioux, Nez Perce, and Apache peoples, written mainly from the non-Native   point-of-view. Indian resistance, eventual defeat, and removal to reservations is   sometimes movingly described. Though the book is overtly sympathetic to the plight of the   Indians, ""asides"" throughout seem to assume that the reader relates more to   white interests: ""Best of all [the whites'] hunting rifles had telescopic sights that   allowed them to knock a brave out of the saddle a half mile away."" The word   ""brave"" is used several times in the book. In one episode, Kiowa spirituality is   belittled: ""The Kiowas could easily have wiped out the small caravan...had their   medicine man not heard an owl, his spirit helper. An owl had hooted, meaning, he said,   that they must attack only the second group of whites to come along the road that day.   Thus General Sherman kept his red hair thanks to a restless owl."" These examples   indicate a tendency to perpetuate an ""us-and-them"" mentality rather than seeking   to bridge gaps in intercultural understanding.

(The Wild West in American History). (upper elementary).         This book traces the battles waged by various North American tribes and leaders---Red   Cloud, Crazy Horse, Chief Joseph, Quanah Parker, and Geronimo---ending with the Battle of   Wounded Knee. The text is generally sympathetic to American Indians but some   characterizations are harsh and stereotypical, for example: ""Apaches were pitiless,   crafty and distrustful who fought the white men fearlessly."" Illustrated with   archival photographs and color illustrations, many of which concentrate on scenes of   violence and show the Indians as aggressors rather than victims.

This history of the Plains Indians uses stereotypical language (e.g., Plains Indians   are described as having ""curved noses"") and repeats romantic terms such as   ""thrilling,"" ""magical,"" and ""mysterious."" Sources for the   paintings that illustrate the book are indicated, but the well-known artists who created   these works are not identified.       May, Robin; Bergin Mark, illus.  A Plains Indian Warrior . Vero Beach, FL: Rourke Enterprises Inc.; 1988. 30 pages. (lower elementary) ?.         This brief overview of historic Plains lifeways covers such topics as buffalo hunting,   tribal organization, religion, and warfare. Final sections cover the Battle of Wounded   Knee and the life of Plains Indians today. While this is a clearly-written,   straightforward presentation, it oversimplifies and generalizes, for example,   ""Generally, the Plains Indians had happy marriages"" or ""After the war the   Plains Indian was forbidden to be a real Indian."" Definitions in the glossary are   questionable, or, in some cases, tending toward the absurd, for instance:   ""Heathen---A type of religion""; or ""Settlement---a small group of   people""; or ""Quills---large feathers from a bird"" (no mention of porcupine   quills). The only picture of a contemporary Plains Indian shows him wearing a traditional   headdress.       Newcomb, W. W. Jr; Story, Hal M., illus.  The Indians of Texas: From Prehistoric to Modern Times . Austin, TX: University of Texas Press; 1961. 404 pages. (secondary).         This comprehensive survey of the Native peoples who inhabited what is now Texas, from   the beginning of the historic period to the present, is based on accounts left by   soldiers, missionaries, and explorers. Though written by an anthropologist, the book makes   stereotypical references to the ""savages of the Western Gulf...."" The author   states that ""the terms `savage' and `barbaric' are used to indicate levels of   technological productivity [referring to a 19th-century classification of cultures from   ""primitive"" to ""civilized""] and are not meant in a disparaging   sense."" This is no excuse, however, for perpetuating the use of these offensive   terms. An outline of Texas prehistory is included, followed by chapters describing the   Coahuiltecans, Karankawas, Lipan Apaches, Tonkawas, Comanches, Kiowas, Kiowa Apache,   Jumanos, Wichitas, Caddo Confederacies, and Atakapans. The book ends with a description of   the devastating effects on the Native peoples of Texas from contact and conflict with   Anglo culture. Includes a bibliography and an index.       Payne, Elizabeth; Davis, Jack, illus.  Meet the North American Indians . New York, NY: Random House; 1965. 85 pages. (Step Up Books). (lower elementary) ?.         This reprint of a 1965 publication describes in simple prose for young readers the   peopling of America and the pre-Contact lifeways of representative tribes of the Northwest   Coast, Southwest, Southeast, Plains and Northeast. Post-Contact and modern life are not   covered. The book abounds in generalizations, stereotypes, and condescension. Examples   include: ""The Creek would fight anyone for no reason at all. The Creek just loved to   fight""; ""The Creek played [lacrosse] fiercely. Arms and legs were broken. Heads   were just split open. This was just part of the fun to the Creek""; ""Makah rain   hats were pointed at the top. Maybe this was because the heads of the Makah were pointed   at the top, too!"" Black, white, and orange illustrations are similarly stereotypical   and tend to focus on the unusual and bizarre.       Petty, Kate; Wilson, Maurice, illus.  Plains Indians . Revised ed. New York, NY: Gloucester Press; 1988. 28 pages. (Small World). (lower elementary).         This brief overview of traditional Plains Indian life covers housing, buffalo,   decorative art, religion, games, and wars with non-Indians. The book ends with a   description of the Battle of Wounded Knee; it contains no information on the contemporary   conditions of the tribes discussed. Color illustrations depict grim-looking people.       Shemie, Bonnie; Shemie, Bonnie illus.  Houses of Hide and Earth: Native Dwellings of the Plains Indians . Plattsburgh, NY: Tundra Books; 1991. 24 pages. (elementary) *.         With excellent illustrations, photographs, and text, this book describes the   construction and use of the Plains tipi and earthlodge, with an introduction on Plains   ecology, describing natural materials available for housing. The various stages of   construction are illustrated with diagrams, floor plans, and cross-sections. The meaning   of some of the symbols on painted tipis is explained. Specialized structures, such as the   Sun Dance tipi and the sweatlodge, are also described. Includes detailed illustrations of   traditional material culture items. A frontispiece map shows the geographic distribution   of the tipi and earthlodge.       Warren, Betsy; Warren, Betsy, illus.  Indians Who Lived in Texas . Austin, TX: Steck-Vaughn Company; 1970. 48 pages. (lower elementary) ?.         This brief overview of the Indian cultures of Texas provides information on their   appearance, dwellings, food, crafts, and subsistence patterns. The last topic of each   section is titled ""end of culture,"" which is misleading, since many of these   cultures still exist, if not in Texas, in other states. The author summarizes the   contributions of Texas Indians as follows: ""When the white man came to Texas, he   learned many things from the Indians that helped him to live on the frontier and develop   the state. Geographic names remain as evidence of our rich Indian heritage...."" Some   of the author's descriptions are stereotypical and demonstrate Eurocentric attitudes. For   instance: ""The Jumanos had a strange way of greeting visitors""; ""They [the   Karankawa] had huge heads covered with coarse, bushy hair""; ""Dances were wild   and noisy...."" Includes an illustrated glossary, index, and monotone illustrations.       Warren, Betsy; Warren, Betsy, illus.  Let's Remember Indians of Texas . Dallas, TX: Hendrick-Long Publishing Co.; 1981. 32 pages. (lower elementary) ?.         This simple book describes the traditional lifestyles of the Indians who inhabited what   is now Texas, including the Caddo, Wichita, Jumanos, Karankawa, Atakapan, Tonkawa,   Coahuiltecan, Kiowa, Apache, and Comanche. Written for young readers, the book   oversimplifies with statements such as ""All of the Texas Indians were good hunters   with bows, arrows, and spears...."" There are also factual errors such as ""There   are only a few Indians living in Texas today."" Includes activities and quizzes, some   useful, and others of questionable value. A true-false test asks if ""The first   Indians came to Texas in a bus...."" and ""Indian children ate chocolate   popsicles....""       Watson, Jane Werner; Howell, Troy, illus.  The First Americans: Tribes of North America . New York, NY: Pantheon Books; 1980. 42 pages. (I Am Reading Book). (lower elementary).         This brief overview describes the lifeways of the people who lived on the Plains and in   the Eastern Woodlands, Arctic, Northwest Coast, and the Southwest. In an effort to cover   so many different culture areas, the author oversimplifies, and delineations between   culture areas are often unclear. Descriptions of male activities predominate. Includes   black-and-white illustrations.       Wills, Charles.  The Battle of the Little Bighorn . Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Silver Burdett Press, Inc.; 1990. 63 pages. (upper elementary).         This book describes the Battle of the Little Bighorn---relating what preceded it, how   it occurred, and its consequences. An afterword briefly recounts 20th-century developments   in Indian--white relations. Includes an index and suggested reading list. Illustrated with   color photos, maps, and diagrams.

Beautifully detailed black-and-white line drawings illustrate this clearly written book   describing tipi history and construction, and the tipi's significance in American Indian   life. This useful reference for young readers includes much information on Plains Indian   life.       PLAINS FICTION     Baker, Olaf; Gammell, Stephen, illus.  Where the Buffaloes Begin . New York, NY: Viking Child Books; 1989. 48 pages. (lower elementary).         Little Wolf witnesses the origin of buffalo as they rise from the waters of a sacred   lake and, incidentally, save his village from enemy attack. Little Wolf's tribe is not   indicated, though the story relates that the enemy is Assiniboin. The author makes no   claim that this retelling of a story, published in  St. Nicholas  magazine (February   1915), is based on an authentic Indian legend. The prose is poetic (e.g. ""Northward   the great gallop swept""); some lengthy sentences might daunt younger readers. The   author's use of the name ""Nawa"" for the Great Spirit is purely fictional.   Includes beautiful black-and-white illustrations.       Benchley, Nathaniel; Funai, Mamoru, illus.  Running Owl the Hunter . New York, NY: Harper & Row; 1979. 64 pages. (lower elementary) ?.         This story for young readers is about Running Owl, an ""Indian"" boy (no tribe   indicated) on the western Plains, who wants to accompany his father and the village men on   a buffalo hunt. While intended to be comical, the preposterous story lacks any meaningful   message and mocks the importance of capturing an eagle feather as a symbol of manhood.   Illustrated with cartoons that depict Indians in stereotypical ways.       Culleton, Beatrice; Kakaygeesick, Robert Jr., illus.  The Spirit of the White Bison . Reprint of original 1985 Canadian (Pemmican) ed. Summertown, TN: Book Publishing Company; 1989. 64 pages. (upper elementary).         The destruction of the Great Plains bison herds is poignantly told through the   day-to-day life of the narrator, a white bison, who gradually sees her family and friends   annihilated. The story describes how firearms, the railroad, and the political expediency   of eliminating the subsistence base of the Plains Indians resulted in destruction of the   herds. The parallel story of the demise of traditional Plains Indian lifeways is   represented by the experiences of Lone Wolf, a Sioux boy, who befriends and honors White   Buffalo. Includes black-and-white illustrations.       dePaola, Tomie; dePaola, Tomie illus.  The Legend of the Indian Paintbrush . New York, NY: Putnam Publishing Group; 1991. 32 pages. (lower elementary).         In this adaptation of the legend of the Indian Paintbrush flower, the author credits   Ruth D. Isely's ""Texas Wildflowers, Stories and Legends"" for his inspiration.   The story follows Little Gopher, a Native boy (no tribe indicated),who receives a vision   that he will become great among his people as a painter of ""the deeds of warriors and   the visions of the shaman."" With brushes made from the hair of animals; paint from   crushed berries, flowers, and rocks; and canvas made from animal skins, Little Gopher   creates his paintings. However, he is dissatisfied with his artwork---rather than   reflecting the colors of the setting sun, his paint colors appear dull and dark. One night   he hears a voice that tells him to go where he watches the evening sun, and on the ground   he will find what he needs. There he is surrounded by brushes filled with paint, each one   a color of the sunset. The brushes take root and are known today as Indian Paintbrush   flowers. The illustrations do not reflect Plains material culture.       Dorris, Michael (Modoc).  A Yellow Raft in Blue Water . New York, NY: Henry Holt and Company; 1987. 343 pages. (secondary/adult).         This beautifully written novel revolves around three women, from three different   generations of the same American Indian family: Rayona, her mother Christine, and Rayona's   Aunt Ida. Beginning in the present and moving back chronologically, each woman tells her   own story. The settings range from Seattle to an unnamed reservation in Montana. The   characters are complex and richly drawn, and their personal views of the same events   overlap and often conflict. The text gives insights on reservation life, as well as what   life can be for Natives living off-reservation. Contains some sexual passages.       Erdrich, Louise (Chippewa).  Love Medicine . New York, NY: Holt, Rinehart and Winston; 1984. 272 pages. (secondary/adult).         This superbly-written contemporary novel traces the lives of the Kashpaws, an extended   Chippewa family, living on and off the reservation in rural North Dakota. Beginning in   1981 and ranging back as far as 1934, the book is structured so that each family member   tells his or her own story---and all the stories are interrelated. The powerful narrative   of family love, personal pride, and conflict is set amid the hard realities of reservation   life. Contains some sexual passages.       Goble, Paul; Goble, Paul, illus.  Death of the Iron Horse . New York, NY: Bradbury Press; 1987. 28 pages. (lower elementary).         Loosely based on an August 1867 protest to the construction of the Union Pacific   Railroad through Cheyenne land, this novel tells the story of a group of young Cheyenne   who derail a freight train, killing its three-man crew. Text and lively full-color   illustrations depict the scattering cargo---dollar bills thrown to the wind and fabric   bolts streaming in the air as they unwind from galloping horses. The author's attempt to   have readers share the perspective of the young Cheyenne protagonist is marred by the   celebration of a violent killing, which might make this book unsuitable for the reading   level for which it is intended.       Goble, Paul; Goble, Paul, illus.  Dream Wolf.  Reprint of  The Friendly Wolf , Macmillan 1974 ed. New York, NY: Bradbury Press; 1990. 28 pages. (lower elementary).         Two Plains Indian children become lost and are cared for and led home by friendly   wolves. This story is intended to convey to young readers that in American Indian legends,   wolves are often portrayed as helpful to humans rather than dangerous. The final page   presents poems about wolves and American Indian names that contain the word   ""wolf."" The book opens with a quote from Lakota chief Standing Bear: ""We   did not think of the great plains as wild. Only to the white man was nature a `wilderness'   infested with `wild' animals."" Includes appealing, lively, full-color illustrations   on each page.       Goble, Paul; Goble, Paul, illus.  The Gift of the Sacred Dog . Scarsdale, NY: Bradbury Press; 1980. 27 pages. (elementary).         In this story of an American Indian tribe's introduction to the horse, a Plains Indian   boy (no tribe indicated) asks the Great Spirit to help his hungry people and is answered   by the appearance of a ""sacred dog"" to help in the buffalo hunt. Beautifully   illustrated with full-color drawings.       Goble, Paul; Goble, Paul, illus.  The Girl Who Loved Wild Horses . New York, NY: Bradbury Press; 1978. 27 pages. (lower elementary)         This is a story of a Plains Indian girl who joins a band of wild horses and eventually,   the story implies, becomes a horse herself. Includes full-color illustrations on each page   of this engaging story.       Goble, Paul; Goble, Paul, illus.  Love Flute . New York, NY: Bradbury Press; 1992. 28 pages. (lower/upper elementary).         This charming book describes the history and use of the traditional courting flute   played by Indian suitors (no tribe indicated) to attract young women. An example of the   power of the flute is illustrated by the story of a shy young man, who nevertheless   attracts the girl of his fancy by playing alluring melodies on his love flute. Includes   beautiful full-color, full-page illustrations.       Higbie, William F.  A Circle of Power . Liberty, UT: Eagle's View Publishing; 1990. 90 pages. (upper elementary).         Set on the Plains in 1796, this novel is a first-person narrative by young Bull Calf   (no tribe indicated) describing important events in his life: the death of his mother   during childbirth; his vision quest; and his first horse raid. Bull Calf directly   addresses the reader, explaining cultural practices such as, ""You see, it is impolite   for a man to speak or look directly at his mother-in-law. Among our People, the Original   People, a man is not considered worthy to be friendly with the mother of his wife.""   Illustrated with black-and-white ink drawings.       Hoff, Syd; Hoff, Syd, illus.  Little Chief . New York, NY: Harper and Row; 1961. 64 pages. (lower elementary) ?.         Little Chief, an Indian boy (no tribe indicated), wants to go hunting with the men but   must remain behind and ""pretend"" hunt. He encounters a group of pioneers whose   children teach him their games, and when they ask him, ""What can Indians do?,""   Little Chief explains that Indians can call birds, walk without making noise, and perform   a rain dance. After Little Chief saves the pioneer children from a herd of stampeding   buffalo, the whites decide to remain in the valley with the Indians, to which Little Chief   replies ""I am glad....We will be good friends."" Neither American Indians nor   Indian--white relationships are portrayed accurately in this story. Common stereotypes   pervade the book's text, illustrations, and plot.       Lopez, Barry; Pohrt, Tom, illus.  Crow and Weasel . San Francisco, CA: North Point Press; 1990. 63 pages. (elementary).         This is a fictional account of the coming-of-age of two young men on a journey to seek   adventure. According to the author, the tale is set in ""mythic time,"" when   humans and animals spoke the same language. While not based on any indigenous American   Indian tradition, the book is written with respect for Native values. Items of material   culture based on Northern Plains objects are depicted in the beautiful, full-color   illustrations.       Parsons, Elsie Clews (ed.); La Farge, C. Grant, illus.  North American Indian Life, Customs and Traditions of 23 Tribes . Reprint of B.W. Huebsch Inc. 1922 ed. New York, NY: Dover Publications Inc.; 1992. 419 pages. (secondary).         Reprinted from the original 1922 edition, this book includes twenty-seven fictional   narratives, written by anthropologists, about various North and Central American Indian   cultures. The editor attempts to provide a more realistic view of American Indians than   was currently available from popular literature. The resulting collection is uneven. Most   of the stories present the culture from the inside, and two drawn directly from American   Indian sources are particularly successful. Others may leave the reader more confused than   informed. Some of the attitudes and concepts are outmoded. The introduction, by A.L.   Kroeber, refers to the cultures described in this collection as representing ""a   ladder of culture development...in...order of advancement,"" and speaks of an   anthropologist and ""his Indians."" Notes on the various tribes give 1922   statistics, and accompanying bibliographies have not been updated.       Welsch, Roger.  Touching the Fire: Buffalo Dancers, the Sky Bundle and Other Tales . New York, NY: Villard Books; 1992. 270 pages. (secondary).         This collection of seven contemporary fictional stories was written around the theme of   the traditional sacred artifacts held by a Plains tribe. The narratives are not based on   the factual history of a tribe or its artifacts; rather, they are an attempt to understand   the ways and sacred processes of these people as represented by sacred objects. The author   explains that ""The narratives are not the traditional or historical legends of any   particular people or of one particular holy object: they are accounts of all Native   American peoples and sacred artifacts, not A people or ONE sacred artifact."" The   introduction contains useful information on the Native American Church.       ARAPAHO TRADITIONAL STORIES      Taylor, C. J.; Taylor, C. J., illus.  The Ghost and Lone Warrior: An Arapaho Legend . Montreal, Quebec, Canada: Tundra Books; 1991. 20 pages. (lower elementary).         This retelling of an Arapaho legend describes Lone Warrior, who injures himself while   hunting and must survive alone in the wilderness. He is unknowingly tested by the ghost of   an ancestor, who eventually saves him from death by an enemy tribe so that Lone Warrior   can become a leader of his people. The legend provides insight into characteristics that   the Arapaho value in their leaders. Illustrated with full-page color paintings by the   author. A brief description of the Arapaho follows the text. The source for the legend is   cited.       ARAPAHO NON-FICTION     Berthrong, Donald J.  The Cheyenne and Arapaho Ordeal . Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press; 1976. 402 pages. (secondary) *.         This is an excellent, thoroughly researched and documented account of the struggle of   the Cheyenne and Arapaho to ""maintain themselves as a people"" during the   reservation period of the late 19th and early 20th century. The book emphasizes that   ""despite the stresses caused by federal Indian policy, Cheyennes and Arapahoes   maintained the essentials of their tribal societies."" Illustrated with archival   photographs and maps, the book contains extensive notes, a bibliography, and an index.       Fowler, Loretta.  The Arapaho . New York, NY: Chelsea House Publishers; 1989. 127 pages. (Frank W. Porter III, Gen. Ed.) (Indians of North America). (upper elementary/secondary) *.         This is a well-written description of the history and culture of the Arapaho, who were   forced to divide into two independent groups---the northern and the southern---as settler   towns spread across their territory. The Arapaho found it more advantageous to try to keep   peace with the whites than to fight them, and in exchange for supplies and gifts, they   allowed non-Indians safe travel through their land. The author discusses the Arapaho's   adroit strategies to maintain their culture and legal rights and to explore economic   opportunities in the face of U. S. government policies that imposed assimilation, land   allotments, and government education. Includes a picture essay on symbols and designs used   in Arapaho material culture. The book is well-illustrated with historic and contemporary   photographs and maps. Includes ""The Arapaho-At-A-Glance,"" a reference section,   glossary, and index.       Haluska, Vicky.  The Arapaho Indians . New York, NY. Chelsea House Publishers, 1993, 80 pages (Sonneborn, Liz. Sen. Ed. Junior Library of American Indians.) (lower elementary/upper elementary).         This history of the Northern and Southern Arapaho from the early 1800s to the present   describes traditional society, family and spiritual life. This way of life was brought to   an end as white settlers invaded tribal territory in search of gold and pasture land.   Though they tried to be friendly to whites, the Arapaho eventually suffered the same fate   as other Western tribes---dispossession and confinement to reservations. The tribe later   splits into the Northern and Southern Arapaho. The book traces the story of these two   groups through the 20th century. Despite income from the lease of grazing and mining   rights, many Arapaho today live below the poverty level, and unemployment is high. Though   geographically separated for the last 100 years, the Northern and Southern Arapaho still   share a common culture. Illustrated with archival photographs and a map. A center section   of color photographs showing traditional Arapaho objects (weapons, tools, clothing,   pouches, bags, and parfleches) highlights decorative work with beads, feathers, and   quills, and explains the significance of symbols found on some of the pieces. Includes a   chronology from 1803--1963, a glossary and an index.       McLain, Gary (part Choctaw); Taylor, Michael.  The Indian Way: Learning to Communicate with Mother Earth .

The reader is invited to listen to the stories of Grandpa Iron, a Northern Arapaho   medicine man, to learn about the environment from the American Indian perspective. Grandpa   tells a story for each month of the year about such topics as food, elders, the home,   animals, and art. The stories are followed by suggested environmental activities, e.g. for   October (the Moon of Falling Leaves), sage-gathering is the suggested activity.       ARAPAHO FICTION     Taylor, Morris.  The Top of the Hill . Happy Camp, CA: Naturegraph; 1987. 62 pages. (upper elementary/secondary).         This contemporary novel tells the story of eight-year-old Red Feather's struggle to   accept the impending death of his beloved great grandfather, Dark Sky, an Arapaho medicine   man. Red Feather's fear and confusion about death and his own mortality are replaced by an   understanding and acceptance of the Arapaho view, after Dark Sky guides the child through   a vision quest in the mountains.

clueweb09-enwp00-88-18326	"                     Brazil (mythical island)          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia      Â Â (Redirected from  Huy Brasil )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search          Brazil , also known as  Hy-Brazil  or several other variants, is a  phantom island  which features in many  Irish myths . It was said to be cloaked in  mist , except for one day each seven years, when it became visible but could still not be reached. It probably has similar roots to  St. Brendan's Island . The names  Brazil  and  Hy-Brazil  are thought to come from the Irish  U Breasail  (meaning ""descendants (i.e., clan) of  Breasal ""), one of the ancient  clans  of northeastern Ireland.     [ edit ]   Searches for the island   It appears that as the north Atlantic was explored, the name of Brazil may have been attached to a real place. A Catalan map of about 1480 labels two islands ""Illa de brasil"", one to the south west of Ireland (where the mythical place was supposed to be) and one south of ""Illa verde"" or  Greenland . Expeditions left Bristol in 1480 and 1481 to search for it, and a letter written shortly after the return of  John Cabot  from his expedition in 1497 reports that land found by Cabot had been ""discovered in the past by the men from Bristol who found Brasil"". [ 1 ]   Some historians [ who? ]  claim that the navigator  Pedro lvares Cabral  thought that he had reached this island in 1500, thus naming the country of  Brazil . [ citation needed ]  However, Cabral didn't choose the name 'Brazil'. The country was at first named  Ilha de Vera Cruz  ( Island of the True Cross ), later  Terra de Santa Cruz  ( Land of the Holy Cross ) and still later 'Brazil'. The generally accepted theory states that it was renamed for the  brazilwood , which has an extreme red color (so ""brasil"" derived from ""brasa"":  ember ), a plant very valuable in  Portuguese  commerce and abundant in the new-found land.   The island has also been identified with  Terceira  in the  Azores , which was at one time named  Brazil , while another phantom island sometimes known as  Brazil  was the  Isle of Mam .   Others claimed to have seen the island, or even landed on it, the last supposed sighting being in 1872. Roderick OFlaherty in  A Chorographical Description of West or H-Iar Connaught  (1684) tells us ""There is now living, Morogh O'Ley, who immagins he was himself personally on O'Brasil for two days, and saw out of it the iles of Aran, Golamhead, Irrosbeghill, and other places of the west continent he was acquainted with.""   On maps, the island was shown as being  circular , soon with a central  strait  or  river  running east-west across its diameter. Despite the failure of attempts to find it, it appeared regularly on maps lying south west of  Galway Bay  from 1325 until 1865, by which time it was called  Brazil Rock .     [ edit ]   In popular culture             This article  is in a list format that may be better presented using  prose .  You can help by converting this section to prose, if  appropriate .  Editing help  is available.  (November 2007)         The characters of the movie  Erik the Viking  visit the island, spelled Hy-Brasil in the film's literature, during their quest to find  Valhalla  and end  Ragnarok .   Jack Vance 's  Lyonesse Trilogy  of fantasy novels is set in the mythical Elder Isles, situated southwest of Cornwall and west of Brittany, consisting of a large island called Hybras, ""the Hy-Brasil of ancient Irish legend,"" surrounded by numerous smaller islands of various sizes.   Hy-Brasil  is the title of the 2002 novel by Scottish writer  Margaret Elphinstone . She creates an island-nation somewhere between Newfoundland and Ireland as a thought-experiment.   Hy Brasil is featured in the  Promethea  graphic novels by  Alan Moore .   In the novel  Engelbrecht Again!  by  Rhys Hughes  the main characters meet a mermaid on the island of Brasil while on their way to the country of Brazil.   In the  Saga of Pliocene Exile , a series of science-fiction novels by  Julian May , ""High Vrazel"" is the seat of the Firvulag, an alien race based on the  Fir Bolg  of  Irish mythology .
