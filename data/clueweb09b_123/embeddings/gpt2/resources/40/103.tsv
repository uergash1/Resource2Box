During the over 300 years of Brazilian colonial history, the economic exploitation of the territory was based first on  brazilwood  extraction (16th century),  sugar  production (16th-18th centuries), and finally on  gold  mining (18th century).  Slaves , specially those brought from  Africa , provided most of the working force.   In contrast to the neighbouring Spanish possessions, the Portuguese colony in  Latin America  kept its territorial and linguistic integrity after the independence, giving rise to the largest country in the region.

The Portuguese soon began extracting brazilwood from the rainforest for its valuable wood and for the red dye derived from it.     [ edit ]   The Age of Exploration   The European discovery of  Brazil  was preceded by a series of treaties between the kings of  Portugal  and  Castile , which were the leading seafaring powers at the time. The most decisive of these treaties was the  Treaty of Tordesillas , signed in 1494, that created the Tordesillas Meridian, dividing the world between those two kingdoms. All land discovered or to be discovered east of that meridian was to be property of  Portugal , west of it of  Spain .   The Tordesillas Meridian divided South America into two parts, leaving a large chunk of land to be exploited by the Spaniards. The Treaty of Tordesillas was arguably the most decisive event in all Brazilian history, since it alone determined that a portion of South America would be settled by Portugal instead of Spain. The present extent of Brazil's coastline is almost exactly that defined by the  treaty of Madrid , which was approved in 1750.          Portuguese map by Lopo Homem (c. 1519) showing the coast of Brazil and natives extracting brazilwood.         [ edit ]   Discovery and early settlement   On  April 22 ,  1500 , during the reign of  King Manuel I , a fleet led by navigator  Pedro lvares Cabral  landed in Brazil and took possession of the land in the name of the king. Although  it is debated  whether previous Portuguese explorers had already been in Brazil, this date is widely and politically accepted as the day of the discovery of Brazil by Europeans. Cabral was leading a large fleet of 13 ships and more than 1000 men following  Vasco da Gama 's way to  India , around  Africa . The place where Cabral arrived is now known as  Porto Seguro  (""safe harbor""), in Northeastern Brazil.          The brazilwood tree, which gives Brazil its name, has dark, valuable wood and provides red dye.       After the voyage of Cabral, the Portuguese concentrated their efforts on the lucrative possessions in Africa and India and showed little interest in Brazil. Between 1500 and 1530, relatively few Portuguese expeditions came to the new land to chart the coast and to obtain  brazilwood . In Europe, this wood was used to produce a valuable dye to stain luxury textiles. To extract brazilwood from the tropical  rainforest , the Portuguese and other Europeans relied on the work of the  natives , who worked in exchange for European goods like mirrors, scissors, knives and axes.   In this early stage of the colonisation of Brazil, and also later, the Portuguese frequently relied on the help of European adventurers who lived together with the aborigines and knew their languages and culture. The most famous of these were the Portuguese  Joo Ramalho , who lived among the Guaianaz tribe near today's  So Paulo , and Diogo lvares Correia, nicknamed  Caramuru , who lived among the Tupinamba natives near today's  Salvador de Bahia .   As time passed, the Portuguese realised that some European countries, especially  France , were also sending excursions to the land to extract  brazilwood . Worried about the foreign incursions and hoping to find mineral riches, the Portuguese crown decided to send large missions to take possession of the land and combat the French. In 1530, an expedition led by  Martim Afonso de Sousa  arrived to patrol the entire coast, ban the French, and to create the first colonial villages, like  So Vicente , at the coast.     [ edit ]   Colonisation   At first, Brazil was set up as fifteen private, hereditary captaincies. Pernambuco succeeded by growing sugar cane. So Vicente prospered by dealing in indigenous slaves. The other thirteen captaincies failed, leading the king to make colonization a royal effort rather than a private one. In 1549, Tom de Sousa sailed to Brazil to establish a central government. De Sousa brought along Jesuits, who set up missions, saved many natives from slavery, studied native languages, and converted many natives to Roman Catholicism. The Jesuits' work to pacify a hostile tribe helped the Portuguese expel the French from a colony they had established at present-day Rio de Janeiro.     [ edit ]   Captaincies          Portuguese map (1574) by  Lus Teixeira , showing the location of the hereditary captaincies of Brazil.       The first attempt to colonise Brazil followed the system of hereditary captaincies ( Capitanias Hereditrias ), which had previously been used successfully in the colonisation of the  Madeira Island . The costs were transferred to private hands, saving the Portuguese crown from the high costs of colonisation. Thus, between 1534 and 1536  King John III  divided the land in 15  Captaincies of Brazil , which were given to Portuguese noblemen who wanted and had the means to administer and explore them. The captains were granted ample powers to administer and profit from their possessions.   From the 15 original captaincies, only two,  Pernambuco  and  So Vicente , prospered. The failure of most captaincies was related to the resistance of the Indigenous peoples, shipwrecks and internal disputes between the colonisers. Pernambuco, the most successful captaincy, belonged to Duarte Coelho, who founded the city of  Olinda  in 1536. His captaincy prospered with  sugarcane  mills used to produce  sugar  installed after 1542. Sugar was a very valuable good in Europe, and its production became the main Brazilian colonial produce in the next 150 years.   The captaincy of So Vicente, owned by Martim Afonso de Sousa, also produced sugar but its main economic activity was the traffic of indigenous slaves.     [ edit ]   General government   With the failure of most captaincies and the menacing presence of French ships in the Brazilian coast, the government of King John III decided to turn the colonisation of Brazil back into a royal enterprise. In 1549, a large fleet led by  Tom de Sousa  set sail to Brazil to establish a central government in the colony. Tom de Sousa, the first  Governor-General of Brazil , brought detailed instructions, prepared by the King's aides, about how to administer and foster the development of the colony. His first act was the foundation of the capital city,  Salvador da Bahia , in Northeastern Brazil, in today's state of  Bahia . The city was built on a slope by a bay (Todos-os-Santos Bay) and was divided into an upper administrative area and a lower commercial area with a harbour. Tom de Sousa also visited the captaincies to repair the villages and reorganise their economies. In 1551, the colony was turned into a  diocese  with its seat in Salvador.          Historical centre of  Salvador  today.       The second Governor General, Duarte da Costa (1553-1557), faced conflicts with the aborigines and severe disputes with other colonisers and the bishop. Wars against the natives around Salvador consumed much of his government. The fact that the first bishop of Brazil, Pero Fernandes Sardinha, was killed and eaten by the Caet natives after a shipwreck in 1556 illustrates how strained the situation was between the Portuguese and many indigenous tribes.   The third  Governor General of Brazil  was  Mem de S  (1557-1573), an efficient administrator that managed to defeat the aborigines and, with the help of the Jesuits, expel the French  Calvinists  that had established a colony in Rio de Janeiro (the  France Antarctique ). His nephew,  Estcio de S , founded the city of Rio de Janeiro in 1565.   The huge size of Brazil led to the colony being divided into two  Estados  (states) after 1621, when  King Philip II  created the  Estado do Brasil , the most important colony with Salvador as capital, and the  Estado do Maranho , with capital in  So Lus . The state of Maranho was still further divided in 1737 into the  Estado do Maranho e Piau  and the  Estado do Gro-Par e Rio Negro , with its capital in  Belm do Par .   After 1640, the governors of Brazil coming from the high nobility started to use the title of  Vice-rei  ( Viceroy ). Brazil became officially a  Viceroyalty  around 1763, when the capital of the  Estado do Brazil  was transferred from Salvador to Rio de Janeiro. In 1775 all Brazilian  Estados  (Brasil, Maranho and Gro-Par) were unified into the Viceroyalty of Brazil, with Rio de Janeiro as capital.   As in Portugal, each colonial village and city had a  city council  ( cmara municipal ), whose members were prominent figures of colonial society (land owners, merchants, slave traders). Colonial city councils were responsible for regulating commerce, public infrastructure, professional artisans, prisons etc.          17th century-Jesuit church in  So Pedro da Aldeia , near Rio de Janeiro.         [ edit ]   Jesuit missions       Main article:  Jesuit Reductions       Tom de Sousa, first Governor General of Brazil, brought the first group of  Jesuits  to the colony. More than any other religious order, the Jesuits represented the spiritual side of the enterprise and were destined to play a central role in the colonial history of Brazil. The spreading of the Catholic faith was an important justification for the Portuguese conquests, and the Jesuits were officially supported by the King, who instructed Tom de Sousa to give them all the support needed to Christianise the indigenous peoples.   The first Jesuits, guided by Father  Manuel da Nbrega  and including prominent figures like Juan de Azpilcueta Navarro, Leonardo Nunes and later  Jos de Anchieta , established the first Jesuit missions in Salvador and in  So Paulo dos Campos de Piratininga , the settlement that gave rise to the city of  So Paulo . Nbrega and Anchieta were instrumental in the defeat of the French colonists of the  France Antarctique  by managing to  pacify  the Tamoio natives, who had previously fought the Portuguese. The Jesuits took part in the foundation of the city of  Rio de Janeiro  in 1565.   The success of the Jesuits in converting the indigenous peoples to  Catholicism  is linked to their capacity to understand the native culture, specially the language. The first  grammar  of the  Tupi  language was compiled by Jos de Anchieta and printed in  Coimbra  in 1595. The Jesuits often gathered the aborigines in communities (the  Jesuit Reductions ) where the natives worked for the community and were evangelised.   The Jesuits had frequent disputes with other colonists who wanted to enslave the natives. The action of the Jesuits saved many natives from  slavery , but also disturbed their ancestral way of life and inadvertently helped spread infectious diseases against which the aborigines had no natural defences. Slave labour and trade were essential for the economy of Brazil and other American colonies, and the Jesuits usually did not object the enslavement of African peoples.     [ edit ]   French incursions   The potential riches of tropical Brazil led the French, who did not recognise the Tordesillas Treaty, to attempt to colonise parts of the Portuguese colony. In 1555, the  Huguenot   Nicolas Durand de Villegaignon  founded a settlement within  Guanabara Bay , in an island in front of today's Rio de Janeiro. The colony, named  France Antarctique , led to conflict with Governor General  Mem de S , who waged war against the colony in 1560.  Estcio de S , nephew of the Governor, founded Rio de Janeiro in 1565 and managed to expel the last French settlers in 1567. Jesuit priests Manuel da Nbrega and Jos de Anchieta were instrumental in the Portuguese victory by pacifying the natives who supported the French.   Another French colony, the  France quinoxiale , was founded in 1612 in present-day  So Lus , in the North of Brazil. In 1614 the French were again expelled from So Lus by the Portuguese.          View of a sugar-producing farm ( engenho ) in colonial  Pernambuco  by Dutch painter Frans Post (17th century).         [ edit ]   The Sugarcane Cycle (1530-1700)   Since the initial attempts to find gold and silver failed, the Portuguese colonists adopted an economy based on the production of agricultural goods that were to be exported to Europe.  Tobacco ,  cotton ,  cachaa  and some other agricultural goods were produced, but  sugar  became by far the most important Brazilian colonial product until the early 18th century. The first sugarcane farms were established in the mid-16th century and were the key for the success of the captaincies of So Vicente and Pernambuco, leading sugarcane plantations to quickly spread to other coastal areas in colonial Brazil. The period of sugar-based economy (1530-c.1700) is known as the ""Sugarcane Cycle"" in Brazilian history.   Sugarcane  was cultivated on large patches of land, harvested and processed in the  engenhos , which were the houses were sugarcane was milled and the sugar refined. Over time, the term  engenho  was applied to the whole sugarcane farm. The dependencies of the farm included a  casa-grande  (big house) where the owner of the farm lived with his family, and the  senzala , where the slaves where kept.   Initially, the Portuguese relied on aborigine  slaves  to work on sugarcane harvesting and processing, but they soon began  importing black African slaves . Portugal owned several commercial facilities in Western Africa, where slaves were bought from African merchants. These slaves were then sent by ship to Brazil, chained and in crowded conditions. The idea of using African slaves in colonial farms based on  monoculture  was also adopted by other European colonial powers when colonising tropical regions of America, like  Spain  in  Cuba ,  France  in  Haiti ,  the Netherlands  in the  Dutch Antilles  and  England  in  Jamaica .   The Portuguese severely restricted colonial trade, meaning that Brazil was only allowed to export and import goods from Portugal and other Portuguese colonies. Brazil exported sugar, tobacco, cotton and native products and imported from Portugal  wine ,  olive oil ,  textiles  and luxury goods - the latter imported by Portugal from other European countries. Africa played an essential role as the supplier of slaves, and Brazilian merchants frequently exchanged  cachaa , a distilled spirit derived from sugarcane, for slaves. This comprised what is now known as the  Triangular trade  between Europe, Africa and the Americas during the colonial period.   Even though the Brazilian sugar was reputed as being of high quality, the industry faced a crisis during the 17th and 18th centuries when the Dutch and the French started producing sugar in the  Antilles , located much closer to Europe, causing the sugar prices to fall.

[ edit ]   The Iberian Union and Dutch incursions   In 1580, a  succession crisis  led to  Portugal  forming a  personal union  with  Spain  under the  Habsburg  King  Philip II . The unification of the two Iberian kingdoms, known as the  Iberian Union , lasted until 1640.  The Netherlands  (the  Seventeen Provinces ) obtained independence from Spain in 1581, leading Philip II to prohibit commerce with Dutch ships, including in Brazil. Since the  Dutch  had invested large sums in financing sugar production in the Brazilian Northeast, a conflict began with Dutch  privateers  plundering the coast: they sacked  Salvador  in 1604, from which they removed gold and silver literally in barrels before a joint Spanish-Portuguese fleet recaptured the town.   From 1630 to 1654, the Dutch set up more permanently in commercial  Recife  and aristocratic  Olinda , and with the capture of  Paraiba  in 1635, the Dutch controlled a long stretch of the coast most accessible to Europe ( Dutch Brazil ), without, however, penetrating the interior. But the large Dutch ships were unable to moor in the coastal inlets where lighter Portuguese shipping came and went, and the ironic result of the Dutch capture of the sugar coast was that the price of sugar rose in Amsterdam. During the  Nieuw Holland  episode, the colonists of the  Dutch West India Company  in Brazil were in a constant state of siege, in spite of the presence in Recife of the Grand Duke  John Maurice of Nassau  as governor (1637-1641?). Nassau invited scientific commissions to come and research the local flora and fauna, resulting in additions to the time's knowledge. Moreover, he set up a city project for Recife and Olinda, which was partially accomplished. Some survive up to this day.   After several years of open warfare, the Dutch formally withdrew in 1661; the Portuguese paid off a war debt in payments of salt. Little Dutch cultural and ethnic influences remained of these failed attempts.     [ edit ]   The Quilombos   Work on the sugarcane plantations in Northeast Brazil and other areas relied heavily on  slave labour , mostly of black African origin. Since the early 17th century there are indications of runaway slaves organising themselves into settlements in the Brazilian hinterland. These settlements, called  mocambos  and  quilombos , gathered not only African slaves but also people of indigenous origin. The largest of the quilombos was the  Quilombo dos Palmares , located in today's  Alagoas  state, governed by semi-mythical leaders  Ganga Zumba  and his successor,  Zumbi . The Dutch and later the Portuguese attempted several times to conquer Palmares, until an army led by famed So Paulo-born  Domingos Jorge Velho  managed to destroy the great quilombo and kill Zumbi in 1695. Of the many quilombos that once existed in Brazil, some have survived to this day as isolated rural communities.     [ edit ]   Inland expansion: the  entradas  and  bandeiras   Since the 16th century the exploration of the Brazilian inland was attempted several times, mostly to try to find mineral riches like the  silver  mines found in 1546 by the Spanish in  Potos  (now in  Bolivia ). Since no riches were initially found, colonisation was restricted to the coast where the soil was suitable for  sugarcane   plantations .   The expeditions to inland Brazil are divided into two types: the  entradas  and the  bandeiras . The  entradas  were done in the name of the Portuguese crown and were financed by the colonial government. Its main objective was to find mineral riches, as well as to explore and charter unknown territory. The  bandeiras , on the other hand, were private initiatives sponsored and carried out mostly by settlers of the  So Paulo  region (the  paulistas ). The expeditions of the  bandeirantes , as these adventurers were called, were aimed at obtaining native slaves for trade and finding mineral riches. The  paulistas , who at the time were mostly of mixed Portuguese and native ancestry, knew all the old indigenous pathways (the  peabirus ) through the Brazilian inland and were used to the harsh conditions of these journeys.   At the end of the 17th century, the  bandeirantes  expeditions discovered gold in central Brazil, in the region of  Minas Gerais , which started a  gold rush  that led to a dramatic urban development of inland Brazil during the 18th century. Another consequence of the inland expeditions was the westward expansion of the frontiers of colonial Brazil, beyond the limits established by the  Treaty of Tordesillas  of 1494.

[ edit ]   The gold cycle (18th century)   At the end of the 17th century, the  bandeirantes  found  gold  in the interior of Brazil. The news was met with great enthusiasm by Portugal, which had an economy in disarray following years of wars against Spain and the Netherlands. A  gold rush  quickly ensued, with people from other parts of the colony and Portugal flooding the region in the first half of the 18th century. The large portion of the Brazilian inland where gold was extracted became known as the  Minas Gerais  (General Mines). Gold mining in this area became the main economic activity of colonial Brazil during the 18th century. In Portugal, the gold was mainly used to pay for industrialised goods (textiles, weapons) obtained from countries like  England  and, specially during the reign of  King John V , to build magnificent  Baroque  monuments like the  Convent of Mafra . Apart from gold,  diamonds  deposits were also found in 1729 around the village of Tijuco, now  Diamantina .   In the hilly landscape of Minas Gerais, gold was present in  alluvial deposits  by streams and was extracted using pans and other rudimentary instruments that required little technology. The hard work of gold extraction was mostly done by  slaves  imported from Africa. The Portuguese Crown allowed particulars to extract the gold, requiring a fifth (20%) of the gold (the  quinto ) to be sent to the colonial government as tribute. To prevent smuggling and charge the  quinto , in 1725 the government ordered all gold to be  casted  into bars in the  Casas de Fundio  (Casting Houses), and sent armies to the region to prevent disturbances and oversee the mining process. The Royal tribute was very unpopular in Minas Gerais, and gold was frequently hidden from the colonial authorities. Eventually, the  quinto  contributed to rebellious movements like the  Levante de Vila Rica , in 1720, and the  Inconfidncia Mineira , in 1789 (see below).   The large number of adventurers coming to the Minas Gerais led to the foundation of several villages, the first of which were created in 1711:  Vila Rica de Ouro Preto ,  Sabar  and  Mariana , followed by  So Joo Del Rei  (1713), Serro, Caet (1714), Pitangui (1715) and So Jos do Rio das Mortes (1717, now  Tiradentes ). In contrast to other regions of colonial Brazil, people coming to Minas Gerais settled mostly in villages instead of the countriside.   In 1763, the capital of colonial Brazil was transferred from  Salvador  to  Rio de Janeiro , which was located closer to the mining region and provided a harbour to ship the gold to Europe.   Gold production declined towards the end of the 18th century, beginning a period of relative stagnation of the Brazilian hinterland.          18th century-So Jos Fortress near  Florianpolis , in Southern Brazil.         [ edit ]   Colonisation of the South   In an attempt to expand the borders of colonial Brazil and profit from commerce with the silver mines of  Potos , the Portuguese Overseas Council (the  Conselho Ultramarino ) ordered colonial governor Manuel Lobo to establish a settlement on the shore of the  River Plate , in a region that legally belonged to Spain. In 1679, Manuel Lobo founded  Colonia de Sacramento  on the margin opposite to  Buenos Aires , and the fortified settlement quickly became an important point of illegal commerce between the Spanish and Portuguese colonies. Spain and Portugal fought over the enclave in several occasions (1681, 1704, 1735).   In addition to Colonia de Sacramento, several settlements were established in Southern Brazil in the late 17th and 18th century, some with peasant couples from the  Azores Islands . The towns founded in this period include  Curitiba  (1668),  Florianpolis  (1675),  Rio Grande  (1736),  Porto Alegre  (1742) and others that kept Southern Brazil firmly under Portuguese control.   The conflicts over the Southern colonial frontiers led to the signing of the  Treaty of Madrid (1750) , in which Spain and Portugal agreed to a considerable Southwestward expansion of colonial Brazil. According to the treaty, Colonia de Sacramento was to be given to Spain in exchange for the territories of  So Miguel das Misses , a region occupied by  Jesuits Missions  dedicated to evangelising the  Guaran natives . Resistance by the Jesuits and the Guarani led to the  Guarani War  (1756), in which Portuguese and Spanish troops destroyed the Missions. Colonia de Sacramento kept changing hands until 1777, when it was definitely conquered by the colonial governor of Buenos Aires.          Quartered body of  Tiradentes , by Brazilian painter  Pedro Amrico  (1893).         [ edit ]   Inconfidncia Mineira   In 1788/89, Minas Gerais was the setting of the most important of the conspiracies against colonial authorities, the so called  Inconfidncia Mineira . The Inconfidncia was inspired by the ideals of the French  liberal  philosophers of the  Age of Enlightenment  and the successful  American Revolution , which had taken place in 1776. The conspirators belonged to the white upper class of Minas Gerais and many had studied in Europe, specially in the  University of Coimbra . Several of them, like a great part of the elite of Minas Gerais, had large debts with the colonial government. In the context of a declining gold production, the intention of the Portuguese government to impose the obligatory payment of all debts (the  derrama ) was a leading cause behind the conspiracy. The conspirators wanted to create a  Republic  in which the leader would be chosen through democratic elections. The capital would be  So Joo Del Rei , and  Ouro Preto  would become a university town. The structure of the society, including the right to property and the ownership of slaves, would be kept intact.   The conspiracy was discovered by the Portuguese colonial government in 1789, before the planned military rebellion could take place. Eleven of the conspirators were banned to Portuguese colonial possessions in  Angola , but Joaquim Jos da Silva Xavier, nicknamed  Tiradentes , was sentenced to death. Tiradentes was hanged in Rio de Janeiro in 1792, quartered and his body parts were sent to different towns as an example. He later became a symbol of the struggle for Brazilian independence and liberty from Portuguese rule.   The Inconfidncia Mineira was not the only rebellious movement in colonial Brazil against the Portuguese. Later, in 1798, there was the  Incofidncia Baiana  in the former capital, Salvador. In this episode, which had more participation of the common people, four people were hanged, and 41 were jailed. Members included slaves, middle-class people and even some landowners.     [ edit ]   United Kingdom period (1808-1822)   In 1807, as the Portuguese were allies of  England , the French troops of  Napoleon Bonaparte  invaded Portugal.  Prince Regent   Joo  (future King Joo IV), who governed since 1792 on behalf of his mother,  Queen Maria I , ordered the transfer of the Portuguese royal court to Brazil before he was deposed by the invading army.   In January 1808, Prince Joo and his court arrived in  Salvador , where he signed a commercial regulation that opened commerce between Brazil and  friendly nations , which in this case represented England. This important law broke the  colonial pact  that, until then, only allowed Brazil to maintain direct commercial relations with Portugal.          The  Pao Imperial , 18th century-colonial palace located in Rio de Janeiro, used as dispach house by  King Joo VI  of Portugal and later by  Emperor Pedro I  of Brazil.       In March 1808, the court arrived in  Rio de Janeiro . In 1815, during the Congress of Vienna, Prince Joo created the  United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarve  ( Reino Unido de Portugal, Brasil e Algarves ), elevating Brazil to the rank of Portugal and increasing the administrative independence of Brazil. Brazilian representatives were elected to the Portuguese Constitutional Courts ( Cortes Constitucionais Portuguesas ). In 1816, with the death of Queen Maria, Prince Joo was crowned King of Portugal in Rio de Janeiro.   Among the important measures taken by Prince Joo in his years in Brazil were incentives to commerce and industry, the permission to print newspapers and books, the creation of two medicine schools, military academies, and the first Bank of Brazil ( Banco do Brasil ). In Rio de Janeiro he also created a powder factory, a  Botanical Garden , an art academy ( Escola Nacional de Belas Artes ) and an opera house ( Teatro So Joo ). All these measures greatly advanced the independence of Brazil in relation to Portugal and made the later political separation between the two countries inevitable.   Due to the absence of the King and the economical independence of Brazil, Portugal entered a severe crisis that obliged Joo VI and the royal family to return to Portugal in 1821. The heir of Joo VI,  Prince Pedro , remained in Brazil. The Portuguese  Cortes  demanded Brazil to return to its former condition of colony and the return of the heir to Portugal. Prince Pedro, influenced by the Rio de Janeiro Municipal Senate ( Senado da Cmara ) refused to return to Portugal in the famous  Dia do Fico  (January 9, 1822). Political independence came in  September 7 ,  1822 , and the prince was crowned emperor in Rio de Janeiro as  Dom Pedro I , ending 322 years of colonial dominance of Portugal over Brazil.

(November 2008)       On 5 January 2005 the U.S. Securities and Exchange  Commission  (SEC) accused TV Azteca executives (including chairman Ricardo  Salinas Pliego ) of having personally profited from a multi-million-dollar debt fraud committed by TV Azteca and another company in which they held stock. The charges are among the first brought under the provisions of the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act  of 2002, introduced in the wake of the  corporate financial scandals  of that year.   On April 28, 2005 the  Comisin Nacional Bancaria y de Valores  (CNBV), the Mexican Banking and Securities Commission, notified TV Azteca, Ricardo B. Salinas, Chairman of the Board, and Pedro Padilla L., Board Member of the Company concerning financial penalties being imposed in connection with administrative procedures that were brought by the CNBV in late January 2005 arising from alleged violations of the Mexican Securities Law as a result of transactions that occurred in 2003 among  Unefon ,  Nortel  and  Codisco . The aggregated amount of the financial penalties equals approximately  US$ 2.3 million, of which the CNBV intends to impose upon TV Azteca a penalty equivalent to approximately US$50,000.   April 30, 2005,  Finance Secretary   Francisco Gil Daz  asked prosecutors to bring criminal charges against TV Azteca Chairman Ricardo Salinas Pliego on allegations he used privileged information to trade shares, people familiar with the matter said.   Gil Daz's fiscal prosecutor filed the 1,200-page request to charge Salinas Pliego, who controls the No. 2 broadcaster, with the  Attorney General 's Office (PGR) April 27, said the people, who asked not to be identified. Regulators yesterday separately fined Azteca, its chairman and board member Pedro Padilla US$2.3 million for securities law violations.   The proposed criminal charges go beyond a civil suit brought by the SEC on January 4 that accused Salinas Pliego and his company of securities fraud for hiding a transaction that netted him US$109 million.   Just a few days before the charges were formalized, TV Azteca dennounced a  blackmail  attempt by Gil Daz to avoid the transmission of an investigation by Azteca's reporter  Lilly Tllez  of alleged corruption acts during the  1994 economic crisis in Mexico . According to TV Azteca, the charges made by Gil Daz were in retaliation for the transmission of Tllez report. The rest of the media found the accusations incredibly weak and, given the timing, suspicious: their proof was an unsigned document printed on plain paper stating the terms of the blackmail, supposedly given to a TV Azteca representative by Gil Daz himself in his own office. The case will test the country's insider-trading legislation for the first time since the government toughened the law in 2001 to criminally prosecute violators.   ""There's recognition worldwide that until securities law violators are prosecuted criminally, civil enforcement will have a limited deterrence effect,"" said Jacob Frenkel, a former U.S. federal prosecutor and SEC enforcement lawyer who is now a partner at Shulman Rogers in  Rockville, Maryland .     [ edit ]   Legal and commercial problems with TVM and CNI             This section does not  cite  any  references or sources .   Please help  improve this section  by adding citations to  reliable sources .  Unverifiable  material may be challenged and removed.  (November 2008)       In 1998, TV Azteca had a commercial alliance with Javier Moreno Valle who had serious financial problems with his enterprises, Televisora del Valle de Mxico (Mexican Valley's TV, TVM) and Corporacin de Noticias e Informacin (News and Information Corporation, CNI), the contract was to sell spots and  advertising  in TVM of TV Azteca's sponsors, TV Azteca invested 25 million dollars in TVM for re-estructuration and acconditioning of high TV technology in TVM's installations in Cerro del Chiquihuite in Mexico City as part of the contract.   In 2000 TVM unilaterally broke the contract and commercial relations with TV Azteca because, in words of Javier Moreno Valle, TV Azteca don't accomplished the contract clauses, reporting red numbers in its financial documents, and he takes of new the channel signal to re-transmite their programs. TV Azteca launch a judicial demand against TVM and Javier Moreno Valle for fraud of 25 million dollars given to TVM, a verdict of an international court in Paris, resolved that TV Azteca can take the control and operation of the signal of channel 40 in  UHF  band, because TVM don't return 25 million dollars and don't accomplished the contract clauses, but later the signal was returned to TVM because the electromagnetic spectre of channel 40 was given to Javier Moreno Valle and Televisin del Valle de Mxico in 1993, for the Mexican government and the  Communications and Transport Ministry  ( SCT ) of Mexico, have registered that Televisora del Valle de Mxico is owner of the permission to operate the electromagnetic spectre of channel 40. Nowadays, Javier Moreno Valle have an apprehension and extradition orden by the Mexican government for fraud against the Mexican Treasury Department ( SHCP ), and continues the legal conflict for the control of Televisora del Valle de Mxico and its installations, but 2008 ends the contract between both enterprises.   Illegally, TV Azteca nowadays operate completely the signal and installations of Televisora del Valle de Mxico because never bought this enterprise and its permissions to operate the channel spectre.     [ edit ]   Unefon   Salinas Pliego, 49, made a US$109 million profit in 2003 after buying debt that TV Azteca phone unit Unefon SA owed to Nortel Networks Corp. for a discounted price, and then receiving repayment from Unefon at full value three months later, the SEC said in January. The SEC alleged Mexico City-based TV Azteca, whose shares trade in both Mexico and the U.S., failed to tell shareholders about the transaction.   The SEC requires companies to disclose so-called relatedparty transactions because they may involve conflicts of interest.   Dan McCosh, a spokesman for Salinas Pliego and the companies he controls, declined to comment on the possibility of criminal charges. Salinas Pliego and TV Azteca denied any wrongdoing Thursday and said they would appeal the administrative fines imposed by regulators, according to a statement sent to the Mexican stock exchange.   In September, Salinas Pliego told reporters he wasn't concerned about the SEC investigation. ""We are totally convinced we acted correctly, and we are going to defend ourselves,"" he said.     [ edit ]   SEC Fraud Charges and Downgrades   Mexican regulators started investigating Salinas Pliego and the companies he controls in December 2003, after TV Azteca's outside lawyers publicly expressed concern about the Unefon debt transaction. On January 5, 2005, Ricardo Salinas Pliego was charged with fraud by the SEC [ 1 ] .   Analysts from  Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc. ,  JPMorgan Chase & Co.  and  Deutsche Bank  reduced their recommendations on TV Azteca stock on January 8, 2004, after the company disclosed details of the Unefon transaction, sending the shares 11% lower that day to 5.52 pesos. TV Azteca fell 2.8% in trading today to 5.49 pesos, down 22.4% this year. Its American Depositary receipts fell 13 cents, or 1.6%, to US7.99.   Gil Daz asked Congress last month to revise legislation to expand shareholder rights and facilitate company share listings to spur the stock market. The changes would add to amendments made in 2001 that defined the information controlling shareholders and companies must disclose to minority investors.   The bill that Gil Daz is now proposing would replace Mexico's 30-year-old securities law and reduce by two-thirds, to 5%, the amount of stock shareholders must own to bring lawsuits against company executives, among other provisions. He said the new law won't be as strict as U.S. legislation.     [ edit ]   Federal Radio and Television Law   TV Azteca is infamously known for its attacks on  Javier Corral  (ex Congressman, PAN) for his opposition to the  Ley Federal de Radio y Televisin  (LFRT), the Federal Radio and Television Law. The latter was a proposal of law concerning the licensing and regulation of the electromagnetic spectrum. The LFRT was favourable to both TV Azteca and Televisa (who together control 95 percent of all television frequencies) because it allowed them to renew their licenses without paying for them. Javier Corral, by leading the campaign against the LFRT, became the object of attacks by TV Azteca. These attacks were of such nature that the Permanent Commission of the Congress of Union had to vote an 'Agreement Point' (non binding resolution), condemning the overtly propagandistic campaign by the 'TV broadcasters' against Corral and another ex-Senator,  Manuel Bartlett . However, in the original proposal of 'Agreement Point', only TV Azteca was mentioned, for Televisa did not attack either of the former. [ 2 ] [ 3 ]   According to  The Economist , the Ley Federal de Radio y Televisin ""raced through Congress confirming the country's longstanding television duopoly"" and constituted a ""giveaway of radio spectrum and a provision that allows broadcasting licenses to be renewed more or less automatically"".

(September 2008)           U.S. Capitol shooting incident (1954)         Lebron is arrested after participating in the attack.       Location   Washington, D.C.       Date   March 1 ,  1954       Attack type   shooting       Deaths   None       Injured   Alvin M. Bentley ,  Clifford Davis ,  Ben F. Jensen ,  George Hyde Fallon , and  Kenneth A. Roberts       Perpetrator(s)   Lolita Lebrn , Rafael Cancel Miranda, Andrs Figueroa Cordero, and Irving Flores Rodrguez       The  United States Capitol shooting incident of 1954  was an attack on  March 1 ,  1954  by four  Puerto Rican nationalists  who shot 30 rounds using  automatic pistols  from the  Ladies' Gallery  (a balcony for visitors) of the  House of Representatives chamber  in the  United States Capitol .   The attackers,  Lolita Lebrn , Rafael Cancel Miranda, Andres Figueroa Cordero, and Irving Flores Rodrguez, unfurled a  Puerto Rican flag  and began shooting at the 240 Representatives of the  83rd Congress  who were on the floor during debate over an  immigration bill . According to Cancel Miranda's recollection of the events (given in a radio interview with Puerto Rican media in 2006) [ citation needed ] , Lebrn shot her pistol towards the ceiling (as she did not wish to hurt anyone), and Figueroa's pistol jammed. Cancel Miranda suspects he was responsible for most of the injuries and damage.   Five representatives were wounded in the attack, one [ specify ]  seriously. The wounded lawmakers were  Alvin M. Bentley  ( R-Michigan ), who took a bullet to the chest,  Clifford Davis  ( D-Tennessee ), who was shot in the leg,  Ben F. Jensen  ( R-Iowa ), who was shot in the back, as well as  George Hyde Fallon  ( D-Maryland ) and  Kenneth A. Roberts  ( D-Alabama ).  House pages  helped carry Alvin Bentley off the House floor. Miranda suspects he personally wounded three and perhaps four of the five injured representatives. [ citation needed ]  He is also certain that Flores wounded the fifth representative. [ citation needed ]   The attackers were immediately arrested. Figueroa Cordero requested to be charged with a  capital crime  and given capital punishment by electrocution. [ citation needed ]  Lebrn had a written note in her coat explaining the motives for the attack, which she had written given the rather high probability of her being killed in crossfire. [ citation needed ]  All the attackers were given minimum sentences of 70 years in prison, after their death sentences were commuted by  President   Dwight D. Eisenhower .   As a result of the incident, the backs of the chairs on the floors of both the House of Representatives and Senate chambers were lined with bulletproof material.

[ citation needed ]  In 1979, President  Jimmy Carter  freed the remaining assailants. Their release coincided with  Fidel Castro's  release of several American CIA agents being held in  Cuba  on  espionage  charges. Carter's administration denied that there were any connections to the  Cuban  release, saying it was making a humanitarian gesture.

This is a cry for victory in our struggle for independence . . . The United States of America is betraying the sacred principles of mankind in their continuous subjugation of my country . . . I take all for responsible.     Lolita Lebrn [ citation needed ] ,  from a handwritten note found in her purse after the attack       [ edit ]   Trivia   There are still bullet holes from the incident, found in the ceiling and in a desk drawer on the Republican side of the House floor.

It is hot and humid along the coastal plains on both sides of the country, whereas at higher elevations such as Mexico City, the climate is drier and more temperate.  The hot, wet season is May to October, with the hottest and wettest months falling between June and September over most of the country.  December to February are the coolest months, when the winds can make northern Mexico chilly, with temperatures approaching freezing. It was 4 of the most amazing months of my life.

It is located north of  Adjuntas  and  Ponce ; south of  Hatillo  and  Arecibo ; east of  Lares ; and west of  Ciales  and  Jayuya . In  land area  it is the third largest municipality in Puerto Rico (after  Arecibo  and  Ponce ). According to the  2000 US Census  the city has a  population  of 35,336 spread over 24  wards  and Utuado Pueblo (the  downtown  area and the administrative center of the city). The name Utuado derives from the  Tano  word ""Otoao"", meaning ""between mountains"". The municipality's known as ""La Ciudad del Viv"" meaning ""The City of the Viv""; Viv is the river that runs through Utuado: one part of it comes from  Adjuntas  and the other from  Jayuya . These two rivers then meet near the  Fernando L. Ribas Dominicci  Avenue and continue the journey to  Lago Dos Bocas .   Utuado is the principal city of the Utuado  Micropolitan Statistical Area  and is part of the  San Juan-Caguas-Fajardo Combined Statistical Area .

It was the first town established in the interior mountainous region of the island known as  La Cordillera Central  and the 11th oldest established municipality in Puerto Rico, following:  San Juan ,  San Germn ,  Coamo ,  Arecibo ,  Aguada ,  Loiza ,  Ponce ,  Aasco ,  Guayama  and  Manati .     [ edit ]   Columbus's arrival   At the time of the discovery of the island on November 19, 1493 by  Christopher Columbus , Puerto Rico was inhabited by the Tano Indians. The Tanos were a culturally developed society with a universal  language , a developed agricultural system, and a social organization based on  caciques  or  chieftains . The Utuado area was ruled over by cacique Guarionex. In  barrio  Caguana, the Tanos built an impressive series of courts or  bateyes , The Caguana Ceremonial Park or  Centro Ceremonial Indgena de Caguana , that is considered the best example of Taino engineering in the  West Indies .     [ edit ]   Utuado's early history: XVI - XVIII   In his epic work  El Dorado Borincano, La economia de la conquista 1510-1550 , Jalil Sued Badillo gives a detailed account of the economic state of Puerto Rico during the first decades after the discovery and mentions the importance of the Otoao region. From 1510 through 1513 the island witnessed a Tano rebellion as a result of harsh and inhumane treatment by the  Spanish  settlers. During the process of pacification many Spaniards settled in the area now occupied by the municipality of Utuado and set up farms ( haciendas ), initially on behalf of the Spanish government (Hacienda Real), to provide food to the Indian slaves working the gold mines and the Spanish colonists in the area. One of the first settlers in the Otoao region in 1512 was Antonio Sedeo, the island's  bookkeeper . His farm's main crop was  yuca . His farm was sold in 1519 to Blas de Villasante, the island's treasurer, for 525 gold pesos.   Areas in the Utuado region that were exploited for gold include Salto Arriba, initially, then later in the 1530s Caguana and Don Alonso. In the 1530s, landowners in the Don Alonso area petitioned the  Spanish Crown  permission to establish a town in the area but it was never granted.   Once the gold mining era ends toward the end of the 1500s, very little is known about the Utuado region until the early 1700s. According to the Puerto Rican historian Fernando Pic, the few documents that exist indicate the area was mostly unpopulated and densely forested. On the other hand, he states the fact that Utuado is the municipality with the most caves, that most likely served as dwellings for Indians or runaway slaves.   The agreement to establish the town of Utuado by the 60 families of Arecibo states they purchased the ""Hato de Otoao"" for 569  pesos  and 5 reales from owners Manuel Natal and Felipa Romn. It also states their desire to choose where on the land the Town Center would be located, which indicates the area was not populated yet.   During his visit to the island in 1771,  Fray Iigo Abbad y Lasierra  states the principal economic activity in the Utuado region was  cattle raising , horses and mules. He mentions a small amount of agricultural activity existed but the population only produced enough  tobacco  and  coffee  for their own consumption.   During the late 1700s and early 1800s Utuado's population continued to grow as coffee gained in importance and growers saw the need for high altitudes and mountainous terrain to produce the best  coffee beans . People not only  migrated  from the Puerto Rican coastal towns but also from Ireland (Founder Sebastian de Morfi = Sebastian Murphy),  Canary Islands  and the  Balearic Islands  of  Majorca  and  Minorca , all seeking the riches that coffee had to offer.          ""Utuado Street Scene"" from Harper's Weekly May 13, 1899         [ edit ]   The golden era of coffee - ""black gold""          Utuado in 1896 during the coffee golden era       During the late 1800s Utuado experienced an explosive economic growth centered around the cultivation of coffee, also known at the time as  oro negro  or ""black gold."" By the 1890s Utuado was the largest producer of coffee in Puerto Rico and the second municipality (after Ponce) with the largest population. It produced a rich social lifestyle for many of its citizens and a casino and theatre were established in the town. The progress of the town was so evident that the regent Queen of Spain,  Mara Cristina , honored the town with the title of  Ciudad  (City) on August 20, 1894. [ 1 ]  In 1896 or 1897 Utuado was the first city in Puerto Rico with a  public electric lighting  system powered by a  hydraulic turbine   power plant , [ 2 ] [ 3 ]  and in that same year mayor Juan Casellas was planning a  train  system to unite Utuado with Arecibo. By 1899 this golden era came to a screeching halt due to two very important events that had a lasting negative effect on the city's economy. The first event was the  United States   occupation of the island in 1898 , which made sugar the new crop of importance instead of coffee. Utuado's mountainous landscape was not ideal for growing  sugarcane , making it impossible for it to compete in the sugar industry on a significant level. The second event and the one to have the most profound impact was  Hurricane San Ciriaco  in 1899, which literally wiped out the coffee haciendas.

It also produces oranges (ranked 4th),  plantains  (ranked 6th) and bananas (ranked 9th). It has also been successful with livestock inventory ranking 3rd with hives of  bees  and 13th with  pigs . Industrially, Utuado counts with a few companies that produce textiles, paper and stone.     [ edit ]   Business   Utuado today is equipped with a modern and competitive  telecommunications  infrastructure. Major cell phone companies including  Claro ,  Centennial  and  Sprint  offer  mobile  coverage, and Liberty Cablevision and  DirecTV  offer  cable  and  satellite television  service, respectively, with Spanish and English channels ( ABC ,  CBS ,  NBC ,  FOX ,  CNN , and many others) as well as high-speed  internet  service. Most of the public areas in the University of Puerto Rico Utuado campus are set up with  Wi-Fi  wireless internet access.

The Iglesia San Miguel Arcangel, the local Catholic parrish, was founded in 1746. The current double-steepled church was built between 1872 and 1878 and is listed in the  National Register of Historic Places , along with the Caguana Ceremonial Park and the Blanco Bridge or ""Puente Blanco"" located in barrio Arenas joining Utuado with Adjuntas. Other buildings in Utuado Pueblo that retain their colonial architectural features include The Center for Art, Culture and Tourism in the old Tobacco Coop building, the old hospital ""Hospital Catalina Figueras and Teatro San Miguel, among others (for pictures of these and other buildings see photo gallery below).          Lago Dos Bocas              Lago Caonillas in Barrio Don Alonso       The Rio Abajo Forest Reserve ( Bosque Estatal Rio Abajo ) is a 5,780-acre (23 km 2 ) forest reserve shared with Arecibo and home to 223 plants and wildlife species including: native  silk-cotton trees , Asian  teaks , Dominican and Honduran  mahogany  and Australian  pines . It is also home to a captive population of the critically endangered  Puerto Rican Amazon .   East of the Rio Abajo Forest Reserve is  Lago Dos Bocas , one of several man made lakes in Utuado. From El Embarcadero, near routes 123 and 146, boats take guests around the water to one of the many restaurants for lakeside dining.   Lago Caonillas  in the western region of Utuado is another man made lake.

It is located north of  Adjuntas  and  Ponce ; south of  Hatillo  and  Arecibo ; east of  Lares ; and west of  Ciales  and  Jayuya . In  land area  it is the third largest municipality in Puerto Rico (after  Arecibo  and  Ponce ). According to the  2000 US Census  the city has a  population  of 35,336 spread over 24  wards  and Utuado Pueblo (the  downtown  area and the administrative center of the city). The name Utuado derives from the  Tano  word ""Otoao"", meaning ""between mountains"". The municipality's known as ""La Ciudad del Viv"" meaning ""The City of the Viv""; Viv is the river that runs through Utuado: one part of it comes from  Adjuntas  and the other from  Jayuya . These two rivers then meet near the  Fernando L. Ribas Dominicci  Avenue and continue the journey to  Lago Dos Bocas .   Utuado is the principal city of the Utuado  Micropolitan Statistical Area  and is part of the  San Juan-Caguas-Fajardo Combined Statistical Area .

It was the first town established in the interior mountainous region of the island known as  La Cordillera Central  and the 11th oldest established municipality in Puerto Rico, following:  San Juan ,  San Germn ,  Coamo ,  Arecibo ,  Aguada ,  Loiza ,  Ponce ,  Aasco ,  Guayama  and  Manati .     [ edit ]   Columbus's arrival   At the time of the discovery of the island on November 19, 1493 by  Christopher Columbus , Puerto Rico was inhabited by the Tano Indians. The Tanos were a culturally developed society with a universal  language , a developed agricultural system, and a social organization based on  caciques  or  chieftains . The Utuado area was ruled over by cacique Guarionex. In  barrio  Caguana, the Tanos built an impressive series of courts or  bateyes , The Caguana Ceremonial Park or  Centro Ceremonial Indgena de Caguana , that is considered the best example of Taino engineering in the  West Indies .     [ edit ]   Utuado's early history: XVI - XVIII   In his epic work  El Dorado Borincano, La economia de la conquista 1510-1550 , Jalil Sued Badillo gives a detailed account of the economic state of Puerto Rico during the first decades after the discovery and mentions the importance of the Otoao region. From 1510 through 1513 the island witnessed a Tano rebellion as a result of harsh and inhumane treatment by the  Spanish  settlers. During the process of pacification many Spaniards settled in the area now occupied by the municipality of Utuado and set up farms ( haciendas ), initially on behalf of the Spanish government (Hacienda Real), to provide food to the Indian slaves working the gold mines and the Spanish colonists in the area. One of the first settlers in the Otoao region in 1512 was Antonio Sedeo, the island's  bookkeeper . His farm's main crop was  yuca . His farm was sold in 1519 to Blas de Villasante, the island's treasurer, for 525 gold pesos.   Areas in the Utuado region that were exploited for gold include Salto Arriba, initially, then later in the 1530s Caguana and Don Alonso. In the 1530s, landowners in the Don Alonso area petitioned the  Spanish Crown  permission to establish a town in the area but it was never granted.   Once the gold mining era ends toward the end of the 1500s, very little is known about the Utuado region until the early 1700s. According to the Puerto Rican historian Fernando Pic, the few documents that exist indicate the area was mostly unpopulated and densely forested. On the other hand, he states the fact that Utuado is the municipality with the most caves, that most likely served as dwellings for Indians or runaway slaves.   The agreement to establish the town of Utuado by the 60 families of Arecibo states they purchased the ""Hato de Otoao"" for 569  pesos  and 5 reales from owners Manuel Natal and Felipa Romn. It also states their desire to choose where on the land the Town Center would be located, which indicates the area was not populated yet.   During his visit to the island in 1771,  Fray Iigo Abbad y Lasierra  states the principal economic activity in the Utuado region was  cattle raising , horses and mules. He mentions a small amount of agricultural activity existed but the population only produced enough  tobacco  and  coffee  for their own consumption.   During the late 1700s and early 1800s Utuado's population continued to grow as coffee gained in importance and growers saw the need for high altitudes and mountainous terrain to produce the best  coffee beans . People not only  migrated  from the Puerto Rican coastal towns but also from Ireland (Founder Sebastian de Morfi = Sebastian Murphy),  Canary Islands  and the  Balearic Islands  of  Majorca  and  Minorca , all seeking the riches that coffee had to offer.          ""Utuado Street Scene"" from Harper's Weekly May 13, 1899         [ edit ]   The golden era of coffee - ""black gold""          Utuado in 1896 during the coffee golden era       During the late 1800s Utuado experienced an explosive economic growth centered around the cultivation of coffee, also known at the time as  oro negro  or ""black gold."" By the 1890s Utuado was the largest producer of coffee in Puerto Rico and the second municipality (after Ponce) with the largest population. It produced a rich social lifestyle for many of its citizens and a casino and theatre were established in the town. The progress of the town was so evident that the regent Queen of Spain,  Mara Cristina , honored the town with the title of  Ciudad  (City) on August 20, 1894. [ 1 ]  In 1896 or 1897 Utuado was the first city in Puerto Rico with a  public electric lighting  system powered by a  hydraulic turbine   power plant , [ 2 ] [ 3 ]  and in that same year mayor Juan Casellas was planning a  train  system to unite Utuado with Arecibo. By 1899 this golden era came to a screeching halt due to two very important events that had a lasting negative effect on the city's economy. The first event was the  United States   occupation of the island in 1898 , which made sugar the new crop of importance instead of coffee. Utuado's mountainous landscape was not ideal for growing  sugarcane , making it impossible for it to compete in the sugar industry on a significant level. The second event and the one to have the most profound impact was  Hurricane San Ciriaco  in 1899, which literally wiped out the coffee haciendas.

It also produces oranges (ranked 4th),  plantains  (ranked 6th) and bananas (ranked 9th). It has also been successful with livestock inventory ranking 3rd with hives of  bees  and 13th with  pigs . Industrially, Utuado counts with a few companies that produce textiles, paper and stone.     [ edit ]   Business   Utuado today is equipped with a modern and competitive  telecommunications  infrastructure. Major cell phone companies including  Claro ,  Centennial  and  Sprint  offer  mobile  coverage, and Liberty Cablevision and  DirecTV  offer  cable  and  satellite television  service, respectively, with Spanish and English channels ( ABC ,  CBS ,  NBC ,  FOX ,  CNN , and many others) as well as high-speed  internet  service. Most of the public areas in the University of Puerto Rico Utuado campus are set up with  Wi-Fi  wireless internet access.

The Iglesia San Miguel Arcangel, the local Catholic parrish, was founded in 1746. The current double-steepled church was built between 1872 and 1878 and is listed in the  National Register of Historic Places , along with the Caguana Ceremonial Park and the Blanco Bridge or ""Puente Blanco"" located in barrio Arenas joining Utuado with Adjuntas. Other buildings in Utuado Pueblo that retain their colonial architectural features include The Center for Art, Culture and Tourism in the old Tobacco Coop building, the old hospital ""Hospital Catalina Figueras and Teatro San Miguel, among others (for pictures of these and other buildings see photo gallery below).          Lago Dos Bocas              Lago Caonillas in Barrio Don Alonso       The Rio Abajo Forest Reserve ( Bosque Estatal Rio Abajo ) is a 5,780-acre (23 km 2 ) forest reserve shared with Arecibo and home to 223 plants and wildlife species including: native  silk-cotton trees , Asian  teaks , Dominican and Honduran  mahogany  and Australian  pines . It is also home to a captive population of the critically endangered  Puerto Rican Amazon .   East of the Rio Abajo Forest Reserve is  Lago Dos Bocas , one of several man made lakes in Utuado. From El Embarcadero, near routes 123 and 146, boats take guests around the water to one of the many restaurants for lakeside dining.   Lago Caonillas  in the western region of Utuado is another man made lake. This reservoir encompasses over 50 square miles (130 km 2 ) and was constructed in 1948 by the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority.

H.F.:  I was in graduate school studying ethnomusicology at UCLA and I had heard a bit of Afro-Peruvian music. I heard Caitro Soto’s performance of  Toro Mata  on the radio and I really liked it. But what was the turning point was that I went to a concert by Susana Baca, who had recently been ""discovered"" by David Byrne and promoted in the United States and Europe as a world-music diva of Afro-Peruvian music.      So, I went to a concert by Susana Baca at UCLA and just really fell in love with the musical sound of Afro-Peruvian music -- the music is compelling at a gut level and I was just so fascinated with the parallels between what Afro-Peruvian artists have done to re-create their own music and the work that ethnomusicologists do when we seek to understand and sometimes recover musical legacies and genealogies from cultural memory.      I found the history of the revival so fascinating. The more I learned about it, the more interested I became. So, it was a combination of that scholarly interest and loving the music at a gut level.           W.G.: In your book,  Black Rhythms of Peru,  you talk about Peru as a part of the “Black Pacific.”    I think this is a great way for our readers to understand the geography and history associated with black music in Peru.    Where does this term come from and what does it mean?      H.F.:  I talk about the Black Pacific with specific reference to sociologist Paul Gilroy's important book published in 1993,  The Black Atlantic , where he talks about this transatlantic culture that connects Africa, Europe and the Americas and this metaphor of ships crossing the Atlantic Ocean and bringing forms of culture back and forth between people of African descent in all of those places.     The Black Pacific is a way that I conceptualize the African Diaspora in Peru.    I think of the African Diaspora in Peru as being a second diaspora in the Americas, in that Africans were enslaved and brought to the Atlantic coast and sold into slavery there.    But in Peru, the forefathers and foremothers of Afro-Peruvians had to make a second journey.    If they survived the Middle Passage across the Atlantic Ocean and made it to the Rio De La Plata area or to Cartagena in Northern Columbia, then at that point they would cross by land over to the Pacific Coast. So, they were separated in a sense from the core of the African diaspora.    The citizens of the Black Pacific world on the Pacific coast were isolated to a large extent from these Black Atlantic cultural forms. More had been forgotten. The population of African descent was so much smaller than in places like Brazil or Cuba, where you have a greater perpetuation of African-descended cultural traditions.      In Peru, you did not have that to that extent. You had a lot of slaves brought illegally who maybe had been in other areas. You had a smaller number of slaves. And even the metaphor of water that Paul Gilroy uses to talk about the way that the Black Atlantic forms a kind of world that shares certain cultural expressions—the citizens of the Black Pacific were cut off from that ocean, that metaphor of ships going back-and-forth and bringing culture, as well as bodies and commerce.     Before the 1950s and ‘60s, there was not really a sense of diasporic consciousness. Scholars believe that to be in diaspora, it's not just the physical separation from your homeland; you have to actually have a state of mind that connects you to your homeland.    A longing to return. A sense that you are in diaspora, that you have been separated from your homeland. That's something black Peruvians didn't have at that point.     W.G.: Let’s talk more about the history of blacks in Peru.       H.F.:  One of the reasons that so much black music is congregated along the coast in Peru is that there's this history of the descendants of Africans and the descendants of Europeans living primarily in the coastal areas.    Because that is where the Spaniards settled and where they brought most of the enslaved Africans who worked a lot in domestic households but also in some rural plantations that tended to be much smaller than the plantations that you found in other parts of the African diaspora.      In terms of some of the numbers, when you asked how many people of African descent are in Peru, it's kind of difficult to answer that question.    At one point in the 16 th  century, blacks actually constituted about half of the population of Lima.    At a point about 100 years later, they actually out-numbered whites in the country.    But we have to remember that this is a country that has a huge indigenous population, so they were a very important part of the population only in the coastal cities and in a couple of the coastal / rural regions near there, like Lima and its surroundings.      So, in terms of what it's like to be black in Lima and what happened to this relatively large population of blacks in Peru—not large in terms of numbers, because the numbers that I've seen are, at the highest point of volume there might have been something like 95,000 people of African descent brought to Peru, which is much, much lower than other parts of the African diaspora, like Cuba or Brazil.     But, basically what happens is that eventually Peru becomes independent.    They withdraw from the slave trade, but they continue in the 19 th  century to import enslaved.    Africans from the Americas, so you get these very enculturated people of African descent. Perhaps slaves who were born in slavery in the Americas to African parents or enslaved Africans who had already learned to speak Spanish in Spain or in the Antilles region.      Then you get abolition in 1854 and 1855, and fairly rapidly the black population assimilated into what is called the criollo, or the creole, culture of coastal Lima and other cities along the coast in Peru.    The way that many people put it to me when I just learning about this, when I made my first journeys to Peru, was that the black population had disappeared.    This is kind of the great myth about what happened to the population of African descent and their culture and customs in Peru.    By the early 20 th  century, you had a population of African descent that considered themselves, by and large, to be creoles along with the descendents of Europeans in Peru that shared a set of cultural practices, like foods they would eat, ways of cooking foods, music genres and the habit of getting together in social gatherings called  jaranas  that would last several days to make particular kinds of music called  música criolla , or creole music and to dance the accompanying dances.      There were particular types of humor considered to be the embodiment of criollo culture in Peru so that being criollo was a cultural category instead of a racial category.    It was one that both the descendants of Africans and the descendants of Europeans subscribed to.    Although, the descendants of Africans were not afforded the same social privileges as white criollos in Peru.      Marisol De La Cadena, who is an anthropologist who studies largely mestizo culture in Peru, talks about something called ""silent racism"" that exists in Peru.    This is very much what happens to the descendants of enslaved Africans who become criollo in Peru.    They share a set of cultural practices that are thought to be descended from Europe, but they are not afforded the same social privileges.      For example, you did not have people in positions of social prestige, you did not have people in business, politics or other positions of social prestige who were of African descent in Peru until relatively recently.    It was largely the Afro-Peruvian revival of music and dance in the mid-20 th  century that paved the way for other efforts to address the lack of civil rights and dignity for the descendants of enslaved Africans in Peru.     In terms of numbers, the last time racial data was taken in any census in Peru was 1940.    At that point, the Peruvian population was designated as 0.47% of the population of the entire country, so this seems very, very small.      In fact, the black population is definitely a minority in Peru.    And definitely much smaller than it is in other parts of the African Diaspora, especially along the Atlantic coast in the Americas.    However, this number can also be misleading because when the census taker comes around—and we just went through this in our own country fairly recently—and says, ""What race are you? What ethnicity are you?"" you make a choice.    W.G.: How is the perception of race different in Peru than it is in the US?     H.F.:  In Peru, ethnicity and race are something that one is not necessarily just born into.    The notion of whether you're black or white or any one of the numerous adjectives that can describe skin color and racial or ethnic identity in Peru is something that can come with the process of enculturation, with education, with whether or not you subscribe to the cultural mores that are attributed to that group of people.      If you achieve higher social status by being white or being criollo than you do by being black, then you're less likely to designate yourself as black when the census taker comes around.    So, this is one thing in terms of percentage of the population.    It is true that many people of African descent did die because they were forced to fight in wars for the Peruvian country or because of the hardships of slavery, so many, many did disappear in that sense.    But, the entire black population of Peru and their customs did not.    In Latin America in general, the idea of race is very different than it tends to be in the United States.     In the United States, at least ideologically, many people still believe in what was referred to as the one-drop rule, which essentially held that anyone of African descent was considered black in our country.    Many people still perceive people in this way.      In Latin America, and in Peru as part of Latin America, that's not really the case.    Racial and ethnic designations are more cultural than biological, so that one could be born of African descent but not consider oneself black.    One can change one's racial or ethnic designation throughout the period of one’s lifetime.    There is a greater degree of fluidity, is how best to describe it, in the way that race is conceived and ethnic identity is conceived in Peru and in the rest of Latin American in general.    This is why before the Afro-Peruvian revival, Raúl Romero, a Peruvian scholar who wrote an article on the Afro-Peruvian revival that was published some years ago, talked about the notion that before the Afro-Peruvian revival, blacks were not perceived as a separate ethnic group in Peru.    By and large, they did not consider themselves to be a separate ethnic group—at least in the period of the 20 th  century when they perceived themselves as belonging to the criollo culture that they shared with the descendants of white Europeans.     Now, what's tricky about this is, while you would think that perhaps leads to a situation where there's less racial prejudice or less discrimination against people of color, in fact, that's not the case.    Because, despite the fact that blacks in Peru and in other parts of Latin America might strive to become criollo or to become ""less black"" than they might be because of their parental heritage, they still are treated differently than people with lighter skin color [who] tend to be treated better than people with darker skin color—even in recent years. There was a recent case where a restaurant in Peru was found not to be admitting people of color. There have been complaints for a long time that establishments where people go dancing in Peru do not admit people with darker skin. So, the types of racial discrimination that you see all over the world against people of color definitely exist in Peru, despite this notion that one can become ""less black"" during one's lifetime. The other thing that I need to mention is that there has been a high degree of inter-marriage between the racial and ethnic groups in Peru, producing people who consider themselves to be mestizo, who consider themselves to be a mixture of different racial and ethnic groups. So, things are not really quite as cut and dried in terms of race and ethnicity in Peru as they might be in many parts of the United States.          W.G.: In your book, you talk about “jaranas” as a center for black and criollo culture in Peru.    Tell us more.      H.F.:  I've never actually been to one of the  jaranas  before the Afro-Peruvian revival, but I can imagine with you what it might have been like. One of the important things about imagining that we're at a  jarana  of old days in Peru—at least the way that they are remembered as a symbol in the Afro-Peruvian revival—is that they tended to take place in places called  callejones,  which were basically communal living areas that would have multiple residences built around a common outdoor hallway that had, maybe, one tap that had running water and a common laundry area.      It formed a community and these  callejones , which existed in old Lima, tended to be in neighborhoods that had many residents of Afro-Peruvian descent, as well as white criollos and criollos of other ethnic origin—people of Asian descent and other ethnic groups who share this criollo culture in the 20 th  century.      At the  callejones  or even in private dwellings, scholars who've written about the  jaranas  talk about how they would go on for between four days and a week. They would close the door and no one was allowed to leave during the time period when this was happening. Basically, you have a celebration of this criollo culture going on in the  callejones  or in the private dwelling for days on end where people are playing  música criolla .      They're playing  valses , which are the Peruvian creole version of the European waltz. They're playing the  marinera  which is one of the musical genres that people who subscribe to this criollo culture consider to be kind of a national dance for them or a national form of music making -- the quintessence of criollismo, or the essence of being criollo.      Then there are certain dances that go with these musical genres that you will be performing. If you're not playing music or dancing, then you are performing the particular handclaps. If a  marinera  is being performed and it's in a triple-meter, everyone who is not doing something like dancing or playing music or singing, is clapping along with a special hand clap that goes along with the beat. It goes three-one, three-one, three-one [claps].           W.G.: That sounds great!    What else defines criollo culture in Peru?     H.F.:  There is comida criollo, the style of cooking that has evolved over the years through this mixture of racial and ethnic groups along the coast that is also an embodiment of música criolla. There might be displays of humor and jokes.      Ultimately what happens is that if you're at this  jarana , you are coming together with people who share your culture of criollismo. You are celebrating it through these cultural attributes: music, dance, food, humor, drink. And you're coming together to not only celebrate this culture, but to perpetuate it through these musical and other cultural practices at the  jarana.  And I don't mean to say that jaranas don't exist any more because they do. People still hold jaranas in Peru.      But I think that if you go to hear any of the great performers of música criolla in Peru or in this country—because they tour through this country all of the time and often perform at venues in Peruvian communities in the United States. So, if you hear people like Lucila Campos, Oscar Aviles, Arturo Zambo Cavero … if you hear Eva Ayllón who lives in this country as a great performer of música criolla --   many of these performers also perform Afro-Peruvian music.       I'm thinking about a night when I lived in Los Angeles and was doing a lot of field work in the Peruvian-American community there. I attended an event by Lucila Campos, who is not only a great performer of música criolla but also was the vocalist for the group Peru Negro during their golden age and is a great performer of Afro-Peruvian music.     She gave a performance that evening that alternated between Afro-Peruvian music and música criolla attended by largely white Peruvian criollos, mestizo Peruvians who subscribe to this criollo coastal culture who are now located in Los Angeles. The sense of patriotism of love for their country was so thick, you could cut it with a knife in the air.           This spirit is communicated through some of the lyrics which are very patriotic. The heightened sense of emotion in the singer's voice is sometimes part of it. The way the criollo guitar players learn to play. The jarana style of playing, I've often been told by Peruvian guitar players, is to pluck your instrument really, really strongly because picture yourself: you're the guitar player at this party surrounded by all of these people singing at the top of their lungs, dancing and you need to be heard. And there's no microphone.      So you make your guitar sound like an orchestra. Oscar Aviles, a great criollo guitar player, can sound like he is several people playing the guitar at once.    It’s because of necessity that criollo guitar players have evolved this style of playing, so that's part of it—part of hearing the sound of the jarana.      Then the participatory aspect is really important, too.      W.G.: What’s the philosophy behind this culture?      H.F.:  There’s this sense of romanticism about the music. That might have a sense of patriotism to it, as well, because the patriotism that I'm talking about is really a sense of love for the shared culture that is being practiced. So, the lyrics don't have to be about Peru, necessarily. They can just conjure up images of colonial Lima.      This is important as we get toward the Afro-Peruvian revival in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s as Lima is changing. As the Lima where this criollo culture grew up amongst the descendants of Europeans and Africans and other racial and ethnic groups on the coast is being swallowed up by these tremendous migrations of Andean peasants, of indigenous and mestizo people from the highland regions of Peru who are bringing their culture, who are extending the boundaries of the city of Lima and tapping into electricity and creating, not only an enlarged city, but also a changed cultural environment.       So, the lyrics of the songs and the shared culture of performing these songs and dances together, in a sense, preserves the Lima that no longer is. The Lima that is remembered: colonial Lima and the Lima before the Andean waves of migration.            W.G.: How does Afro-Peruvian music emerge from the jaranas and from criollo culture?      H.F.:  When I would talk to people about, ""Well, what started all of this? What began the Afro-Peruvian revival?"" everyone would talk about this show that happened in 1956 by the Pancho Fierro Company at one of Lima's most important theaters, the Municipal Theatre of Lima, which has since burned down.     Then what was even more interesting was that when I did a little bit of research about this show, I found out that the show was actually directed and conceived and produced by someone who was not Afro-Peruvian at all, but a white criollo folklorist and scholar named José Durand. He was a frequent participant in the  jaranas , whose family connected him to this criollo culture and who knew some of the great  jaraneros , the great musicians and singers and perpetuators of this culture.     José Durand was a scholar, but he really believed that the culture that these elderly  jaraneros  held in their minds and in their practice was as important as what could be learned from books. Jose Durand had a tremendous collection of books. I went to the Jose Durand Collection at Notre Dame in Indiana where they have his collection of thousands and thousands of books.      He was a scholar of the colonial era and he loved the colonial era. So, during this period when Lima was being transformed and colonial Lima clearly was going to be no longer by the 1950s, at this point, there was not really a sense amongst many Afro-Peruvians that there was something called Afro-Peruvian culture and Afro-Peruvian music. In fact, the term ""Afro-Peruvian"" was not even used until later in the 1960s—we're talking about the 1950s now.      There had been a few shows, a few efforts, to collect what might have been left of black or African descended music and dance in Peru prior to the 1950s. There was a show in the 1930s by a company called the Ricardo Palma Company that included a few of what might have been termed at that time ""old black songs,"" songs that maybe some of the few families of African descent in the rural areas outside of Lima still remembered and practiced.     So, there were these fragments that were out there, that were remembered. But they were not really shared publicly or publicly acknowledged because there wasn't a sense that there was something that was separate from criollo culture that was called black culture at that time in Peru.   W.G.: What motivated Durand to do this?     H.F.:  Jose Durand, during this period was motivated by what I tend to think of and have termed as “criollo nostalgia” for the era before the Andean waves of migration when criollo culture was kind of invented in Lima. He wanted to get together a bunch of black Peruvian musicians and dancers and actors. Young people, largely, from these kinds of royal families that had maintained and preserved Black Peruvian culture in the form of music and dance. He wanted to put what they could remember together and celebrate the origins of criollo culture and old, black songs once again.      So, he put together this show that involved members of these few Black Peruvian families who remembered bits and pieces.    Porfirio Vasquez had come down to Lima from Aucallama and brought a family here that became one of the leading families in Afro-Peruvian music and dance. And Porfirio Vasquez remembered the art of writing  décimas . He knew black Peruvian music and dance, and he was hired in the '40s to teach in one of the folklore academies that was established by the government at that time. He was a leading culture bearer.          He became a consultant to Jose Durand and worked with Jose Durand and all of these other black Peruvian families to come up with a show that put together skits, largely depicting plantation days and times of slavery. Songs also often depicting what slave life was like in colonial Lima. And this was a show that was presented for over 1,000 people.      The company existed for just about two years. The first show was in 1956. They played shows, they toured in Peru a little bit and then they had a disastrous tour in Chile in 1957. It was actually on the tour in Chile that Nicomedes Santa Cruz joined the company. Nicomedes Santa Cruz became the next leader of the Afro-Peruvian revival after this period with José Durand when he formed his own company.      Nicomedes Santa Cruz was brought on at that point as a  decimista  and he wrote his famous  décima , ""Black Rhythms of Peru,"" or Ritmos Negros del Peru"" for the show in Chile. But, by 1958, the tour to Chile had been a total financial disaster and for various reasons, the Pancho Fierro Company fell apart. But it gave birth to all of these companies that spun off of the Pancho Fierro Company.      So, you had numerous companies that tended now to be led by Black Peruvians. And you had the second phase of the revival. José Durand had started the practice of trying to revive these old Afro-Peruvian songs and dances.      El son de los diablos  is the example that I talk about in my book, where he combined the methods of art and ethnography to come up with the missing pieces of what was left out of cultural memory and what cultural memory didn't recall of Peruvian music and dance.      El son de los diablos  is an interesting model for the process that came to infuse the Afro-Peruvian revival, the process for taking a music that is remembered in fragments and creating enough to put on stage as a representation of Afro-Peruvian culture, music and dance.          Diablos  means ""devil.""  Son  is a generic term in Spanish for ""song"" or ""musical sound."" And  el son de los diablos  was descended from the Corpus Christi festivals of Spain. It was an old tradition that started out in the churches and then was sent out into the streets as a kind of secular celebration during Carnival time.      El son de los diablos  involved, generally, Afro-Peruvian performers who would go out in the streets during Carnival time, dressed like devils and accompanied by musicians— typically performing guitar, and we know from Pancho Fierro's paintings that there was a large harp instrument used at one point, and the  cajita,  which is a smaller version of the  cajón.    It's a wooden box, held around one's neck and suspended with a rope, that has a lid that opens and closes and makes a percussive sound. It can also be hit on the side or the top with either one's hand or a wooden stick.      So, you had these performers going out in the street during Carnival time dressed like devils and then performing choreography. Each group was a gang, or a  cuadrilla , that went out in the street with its group and performed special dances. There's documentation that there were figures that were performed—often the shape of a cross. Or devils would challenge each other to perform these incredibly acrobatic stunts where they were doing flips and twists in the air, and then coming down tap dancing, let's say. A lot of  zapateo , or Peruvian-style tap dancing was involved.     Well, Pancho Fierro had a painting of  El Son de los Diablos  that shows us what musical instruments were used.    It also shows us that there was what looks like a chief devil or  diablo major , who was larger than all of the other devils and wore a big, grotesque mask over his face. It shows a sense of acrobaticism about the dancing. It shows a particular costume that had tiered knicker pants.      These are the costumes that the Pancho Fierro Company used. It may be that those costumes were only used by one group of  diablos  that Pancho Fierro painted, but to this day, when “el son de de los diablos"" is performed in Lima, they use that costume because that's the documentation that we have historically.      José Durand also worked with some consultants who had previously marched in the streets performing ""el son de de los diablos"" during Carnival. He had a couple of former  diablos  from whom he learned the rhythms that were performed on  cajita  and  quijada , the jawbone, which is also used in ""el son de de los diablos.""    They taught those rhythms.          W.G.: What about the guitar part?       H.F.:  Vicente Vásquez was a very important guitarist in the Afro-Peruvian revival. He created many of the melodies that are now standards for the classic Afro-Peruvian songs that were revived. He also created the guitar melody that goes along with  el son de los diablos.       Where did Vicente Vásquez get his melody for guitar? I don't know if it was similar to any melody that was performed in the street, but it's the one that was invented for the Pancho Fierro show and it became  the  melody for  el son de los diablos , although variations of it are performed.       W.G.: And the dances?       H.F.:  The dances that are performed today and that were revived by José Durand—a lot of  zapateo , a lot of tap dancing. There's been some creative choreography by groups that have revived this dance since then. But this was the first major show in the revival and there was only so far they could go with ethnography, with documentation. Some of it had to be filled in.      W.G.: And so what was Durand’s role?    What did he add to the songs?     H.F.:  José Durand said he remembered that his Aunt Catalina taught him how to walk to a song that she referred to as  El Son de los Diablos.    This song was similar to a children's nursery rhyme.    The lyrics are about this monkey, so it's a nursery rhyme-like song that José Durand remembered from childhood.      Remember that José Durand comes from this family that is very versed in old musical traditions of Lima. So, José Durand, talking with the former  diablos  who were consulting with him about the way that the rhythms were played on  cajita  and  quijada,  determined that the sounds lined up exactly with the  cajita  and  quijada  parts that these former  diablos  showed him.   He felt this was evidence that it was, in fact, the authentic song for  El Son de los Diablos.     W.G.: What’s the big picture here?     What are some of the over-arching themes behind the Afro-Peruvian revival?     H.F.:  I'm not sure that the revivalist concern is exclusive to Peru. I think there have been revivals in many countries around the world. Revivals tend to happen at a time when it's important to get something back that was lost. Or at a time when perhaps a particular group feels that its past is slipping away from it. Or perhaps at a time when conditions make it possible to revive something.     For specific reasons that maybe had to do with criollo nostalgia that was invoked by the waves of Andean migrants coming to Lima, José Durand wanted to revive black Peruvian songs as part of a way of reviving the colonial era. The agenda of Nicomedes Santa Cruz and Victoria Santa Cruz and Peru Negro and the next waves of the revival were very different.      It was more about reconnecting to the African Diaspora. And here I think it might be appropriate to touch upon what I term the concept of the ""Black Pacific,"" which is a way that I conceptualize the African Diaspora in Peru and perhaps a reason why there's that sense of tugging at the chest about the music of the revival. Why it's so important to come up with the authentic version. What's the difference? It's a show.      You can just create what you want. But no, it was very important to the leaders of the Afro-Peruvian revival to reclaim that past. I think it was exceedingly important for Peruvians of African decent.     Black Peruvians felt, first of all, when you think about Peru, you think about the great kingdom of the Incas. Many people both in and outside of Peru don’t know that there were ever people of African descent there. At the time when the leaders of the Afro-Peruvian revival were going to school, they weren't really taught about their ancestors of African descent.      There was not really a sense of diasporic consciousness. Scholars of diaspora say that to be in diaspora, it's not just the physical separation from your homeland; you have to actually have a state of mind that connects you to your homeland. A longing to return. A sense that you are in diaspora, that you have been separated from your homeland. That's something Black Peruvians didn't have at that point.     I think being part of this Black Pacific condition, there are many critics of the Afro-Peruvian revival. People that I met when I was doing my research in Peru who would say, ""Why would you want to study that music? That was all made up in the 1960s. None of it is authentic.""      I think this is a way to trivialize the fact that traditions are invented. They may be more or less invented due to the circumstances that are faced by groups who need to have those traditions. More may have been forgotten about black Peruvian music than some of the musics in some of those other places. So, maybe Afro-Peruvian music is very invented.      But that very-invented music is still black Peruvian music and it really carries with it the unique way that black Peruvians re-imagined their past and identity that became  the  identity that elevated black Peruvians to the main stages of Lima in the 1960s. [It] really was the first movement to recognize that black Peruvians had ancestors that came from Africa who contributed to the culture of coastal Lima and [it] paved the way for groups that didn't come along until the 1980s and 1990s that were the first movements for civil rights for blacks in Peru.    W.G.: They just  invented  a tradition and re-wrote a history that had been partly forgotten?        H.F.:  Maybe it seems different to you because of the very invented quality of it, but there are traditions that are invented all over the world at different periods of time. I guess the situation with Afro-Peruvian music is just how, because blacks were, to some extent, socially invisible at the time of the revival, to have this repertoire that gradually emerged that speaks to a past that many people didn't think of as having existed before that, is perhaps a little bit different or a little more unusual.      For me, the process of becoming more familiar with the details of the Afro-Peruvian revival—or at least the details that were remembered by my consultants who kindly shared their memory of the revival with me—it makes me look at and question a little bit more many of the traditions that we don't think of as being invented in other parts of the world, those that we accept as maybe having been continuously preserved and that may have more invented qualities than we realize.     W.G.: Fascinating.    What’s next?    What happened after Durand’s company collapsed?    Tell us about the next stage of the revival.     H.F.:  Nicomedes Santa Cruz and Victoria Santa Cruz came along in the 1960s. Nicomedes Santa Cruz coming straight out of the Pancho Fierro Company and then Victoria Santa Cruz, his sister, joined him as leader of the company Cumanana in the early 1960s.     Their agenda was very different. Their agenda was inspired by the civil rights movement in the United States. It was inspired by the fact that there were African independence movements going on at this time in Africa where people of color and people of African descent were rising up against European colonialism and against prejudice against people of color.     Their first inspiration was the Katherine Dunham Company from the United States. Katherine Dunham was a very important African-American anthropologist, choreographer, dancer and Hollywood film star. She had a company that had gone through the Americas and [she] used what she called her ""art to ethnography"" method to celebrate the cultural traditions of the African Diaspora. She staged them as choreographed dances.           She came with her company to Lima's Municipal Theatre in 1951 and Nicomedes Santa Cruz and Victoria Santa Cruz were in the audience. This, according to Victoria, with whom I spent three very intense afternoons in Lima when I was doing my research for my book, and also according to some things that Nicomedes Santa Cruz wrote, this was the moment when they realized they could do something. They were there in Lima's Municipal Theater and they had never seen this kind of celebration of Black culture.     To see this in Lima was so inspiring for them. Victoria said to me this is when she realized, ""We have to do something. We have to do something like this.""      One thing I should be clear about is that there were several years between the Katherine Dunham show in 1951 in Lima's Municipal Theatre and the first show that Nicomedes Santa Cruz and Victoria Santa Cruz directed in 1960 in Lima's Municipal Theater with their company, Cumanana.      Nicomedes Santa Cruz, in the meantime, had started to work with the Pancho Fierro Company in 1957 as a  decimista . Nicomedes Santa Cruz was many things. He really was an incredible individual. If there had been no Nicomedes Santa Cruz, I can't even imagine what black music would be like in Peru because it was his leadership that did so much for people of African descent and for the arts of the black community in Peru. He was a poet, first and foremost, a  decimista.     W.G.: Tell us more about décimas.     H.F.:  The  décima  is a form of poetry, involving 10-line strophes,that came to the Americas from Spain. Nicomedes Santa Cruz was involved in not only preserving the  décima  in Peru, but also converting it into a vehicle to talk about racism, international issues going on in the world and to politicize it. And also use it as a form on the mass media.      He had many, many books of his own  décimas  he composed   that he published and he was coached and mentored in learning to write  décimas  by Porfirio Vaáquez, Don Porfirio, the very important consultant who was also used in the Pancho Fierro show whom I mentioned before. So, he was a  decimista.      He also had a television program. He was a journalist. He had a weekly column in a Peruvian newspaper and he wrote occasional columns in other newspapers on themes from poetry to Afro-Peruvian history to criollo culture. He was a cultural critic essentially.    W.G.: Sounds like quite a guy.     H.F.:  He was a producer, a musician, a folklorist and a community scholar. All of this and he had a grammar-school education. He was a blacksmith by trade before he started the Afro-Peruvian revival. Then he realized that he could make a living as a  decimista  and he became a  decimista  as a profession. Then he went on to lead the Afro-Peruvian revival.      So, Nicomedes Santa Cruz first starts the musical theatre company, Cumanana. And then a little bit later, he invites his sister, Victoria, to join him as co-director of the company. I believe Nicomedes started the company in 1958 and Victoria joined in 1959. They had their first show in 1960 and things are beginning to look very different now .    We talked about the sense of criollo nostalgia that infused José Durand's Pancho Fierro Company and the show that they performed. It's with Nicomedes Santa Cruz [that]    ""afro"" begins to be used instead of the term "" negro, "" or ""black"" in Spanish. Now we have  música afroperuana , Afro-Peruvian music, referring, of course, to Africa. So that instead of this sense of the black songs that were part of criollo culture in colonial Lima, now Nicomedes Santa Cruz and his sister Victoria are making an explicit connection to this Black Atlantic world that the Black Pacific is cut off from, to the rest of the African Diaspora, and to Africa, where independence movements have been going on.      Nicomedes and Victoria were both really important leaders during the 1960s in the Afro-Peruvian revival, but they had very different approaches. Nicomedes was incredible in the sense that he did incredible research with the tools that were available to him. He was a lay scholar. He put together theories about the origins of Afro-Peruvian music by reading what he could. He was very well read in terms of the experience of the African Diaspora and other places and the slave trade. [He put] together what bits and pieces were available to him, so he used the tools of folklore and ethnography, going and collecting bits and pieces of remembered  décimas  and  festejos  from elders in the community.      Victoria was very different. Nicomedes unfortunately passed away in 1992, so I didn't have a chance to meet him. He died in Spain. Victoria Santa Cruz had just moved back to Lima when I began doing my research there. She taught at Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh for many years, actually, but retired to Lima.      So, I had the opportunity to hear about all of this in her own words. Although, going to talk to Victoria is really quite an experience. She's a cross between a philosopher and a poet and a sage. You can tell she's a dancer as soon as you see her just by the way that she moves and the way that she sits. She is young beyond her years.    W.G.: Wow.    Please tell us more about what it was like to meet the inimitable Victoria Cruz.     H.F.:  She talked with me about this method she developed, and  ancestral memory . Essentially, Victoria would do things like turn out the lights and light a candle. Then, she’d have everyone reach inside themselves and try to hear the silenced voice of their ancestors.      During the Afro-Peruvian revival, she re-created one of the most important dances that has lived on as a standard in terms of the genres that have come to embody and represent Peru's African heritage, the  landó.  Victoria, according to what she told me, re-created the  landó  by remembering it with her body.      Rather than looking at books and talking to elders, Victoria looked inside herself to try and hear or to feel what had been silenced for many years and to go back and retrieve it as a continued form of communication with her ancestors.      This is a different way of referring to ancestral memory than, say, the way that the Negritude poets or people who refer to communicating with the ancestors in a ceremony of Afro-Cubans with Santeria might use it. It's a very personal sense, the way she talks about ancestral memory.   This was a very liberating and empowering thing for many of her protégées.       W.G.: So did you try it o  "
clueweb09-enwp00-35-13698	"                     Bolero          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Boleros )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search                  Bolero dancer  as seen by  Lautrec         For other uses, see  Bolero (disambiguation) .   Bolero  is a name given to certain slow, romantic  latin music  and its associated  dance  and  song . There are  Spanish  and  Cuban  forms, which are both significant, and which have separate origins. [ 1 ]  The term is also used for some  art music . In all its forms, the bolero has been popular for over a century, and still is today.           Contents       1   Spain   2   Cuba     2.1   Bolero fusions       3   International and American ballroom   4   Art music   5   See Also   6   Notes   7   References   8   External links               [ edit ]   Spain   Bolero is a 3/4 dance [ 2 ]  that originated in Spain in the late 18th century, a combination of the  contradanza  and the  sevillana . [ 3 ]  Dancer  Sebastiano Carezo  is credited with inventing the dance in 1780 [ 4 ] . It is danced by either a  soloist  or a couple. It is in a moderately slow tempo and is performed to music which is sung and accompanied by  castanets  and  guitars  with lyrics of five to seven syllables in each of four lines per verse. It is in  triple time  and usually has a  triplet  on the second beat of each bar.     [ edit ]   Cuba   In  Cuba , the bolero is perhaps the first great Cuban musical and vocal synthesis to win universal recognition. [ 5 ]  In 2/4 time, this dance music spread to other countries, leaving behind what Ed Morales has called the ""most popular lyric tradition in Latin America"". [ 6 ]   The Cuban bolero tradition originated in  Santiago de Cuba  in the last quarter of the 19th century; [ 7 ]  it does  not  owe its origin to the Spanish music and song of the same name. [ 8 ]  In the 19th century here grew up in Santiago de Cuba a group of itinerant musicians who moved around earning their living by singing and playing the guitar. Probably, this kind of life had been going on for some time; but it comes into focus when we learn about named individuals who left their marks on Cuban popular music.   Pepe Sanchez , born Jos Sanchez (Santiago de Cuba, 19 March 1856  03 January 1918), is known as the father of the  trova  style and the creator of the Cuban bolero. Untrained, but with remarkable natural talent, he composed numbers in his head and never wrote them down. As a result, most of these numbers are now lost, but two dozen or so survive because friends and disciples wrote them down. He was the model and teacher for the great trovadores who followed.  [ 9 ] [ 10 ]   The Cuban bolero traveled to Mexico and the rest of Latin America after its conception, where it became part of their repertoires. Some of the bolero's leading composers have come from nearby countries, most especially the great and prolific  Puerto Rican  composer  Rafael Hernndez ; another example being Mexico's  Agustn Lara . Some Cuban composers of the bolero are listed under  Trova . [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Bolero fusions   Jos Loyola comments that the frequent fusions of the bolero with other Cuban rhythms is one of the reasons it has been so fertile for such a long period of time:     ""La adaptacin y fusin del bolero con otros gneros de la msica popular bailable ha contribuido al desarrollo del mismo, y a su vigencia y contemporaneidad.""  [ 15 ]       (The adaptation and fusion of the bolero with other types of popular dance music has contributed to their development, and to its validity and modernity)     This adaptability was largely achieved by dispensing with limitations in format or instrumentation, and by an increase in syncopation (so producing a more afrocuban sound). Examples would be:     Bolero in the  danzn : the advent of lyrics in the danzn to produce the  danzonete .   The  bolero-son : long-time favourite dance music in Cuba, captured abroad under the misnomer 'rumba'.   The  bolero-mambo  in which slow and beautiful lyrics were added to the sophisticated big-band arrangements of the mambo.   The  bolero-cha : many Cha-cha-cha lyrics come from boleros.     The lyrics of the bolero can be found throughout popular music, especially Latin dance music. This gives the creations of a former time a kind of perpetual life. The old trovadores lived close to their people, and their songs reflected the loves, lives and concerns of the people. It has proved surprisingly difficult for present-day musicians to do better. The bolero is a great survivor.   If the bolero does have limitations for non-Latin audiences (for whom the lyrics are mostly unappreciated), its place in Latin music and dance is more or less permanent.     [ edit ]   International and American ballroom   A version of the Cuban bolero is the dance popular throughout much of the world under the misnomer 'rumba'. This came about because a simple cover-all term was needed for Cuban music in the 1930s. The famous  Peanut Vendor  was so labelled, and the label stuck for other types of Cuban music.   In Cuba the bolero is usually written in 2/4 time, elsewhere often 4/4. The tempo for dance is about 120 beats per minute. The music has a gentle Cuban rhythm related to a slow  son , which is the reason it may be described as a bolero-son. Like some other Cuban dances, there are three steps to four beats, with the first step of a figure on the second beat, not the first. The  slow  (over the two beats #s four and one) is executed with a hip movement over the standing foot, with no foot-flick.  [ 16 ]     [ edit ]   Art music   There are many so-called boleros in  art music  (e.g. classical music) which may not conform to either of the above types.   Chopin  wrote a bolero for solo piano;  Debussy  one in  La Soire dans Grenada ;  Bizet  in  Carmen  and  Saint-Sans  wrote boleros;  Lefbure-Wly  wrote  Bolro de Concert  for organ; and  Ravel 's  Bolro  is his most famous work, originally written as a ballet score in  Rhapsodia espaola , but now usually played as a concert piece. It was originally called  Fandango , and is certainly not a bolero as described in this article. In some cases the root lies, not in the bolero, but in the  habanera , a Cuban precursor of the  tango , which was a favourite dance rhythm in the mid-19th century.
