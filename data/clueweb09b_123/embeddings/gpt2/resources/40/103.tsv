Counseling to Prevent Household and Recreational Injuries  RECOMMENDATION  Periodic counseling of the parents of children on measures to reduce the risk of unintentional household and recreational injuries is recom mended. Counseling to prevent household and recreational injuries is also recommended for adolescents and adults based on the proven effi cacy of risk reduction, although the effectiveness of counseling these pa tients to prevent injuries has not been adequately evaluated. Persons with alcohol or drug problems should be identified, counseled, and monitored (see Chapters 52 and 53). Those who use alcohol or illicit drugs should be warned against engaging in potentially dangerous activities while intoxi cated. Counseling elderly patients on specific measures to prevent falls is recommended based on fair evidence that these measures reduce the risk of falls, although the effectiveness of counseling elders to prevent falls has not been adequately evaluated. More intensive individualized multifactorial intervention is recommended for high-risk elderly patients in settings where adequate resources to deliver such services are available. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of ex ternal hip protectors to prevent fall injuries. Counseling to prevent motor vehicle and pedestrian injuries is discussed in Chapter 57. Burden of Suffering Unintentional injuries accounted for nearly 89,000 deaths (34.4/100,000 population) in the U.S. in 1993, making them the fifth leading cause of death.1 Although the age-adjusted unintentional injury death rate has declined by 28% since 1979,2 such injuries remain the leading cause of death in all age groups from 1 to 34 years1 and the leading cause of years of potential life lost before age 65.3 In the U.S. in 1992, injuries accounted for 2.7 million hospitalizations (10.7/1,000 population),4 34 million emergency department visits,5 and 62 million visits to office-based physicians and hospital outpatient departments (nearly 10% of all such visits).6,7 The lifetime economic cost for injuries that occurred in the U.S. in 1985, updated to 1988, has been estimated at $182 billion.8 Almost half of all un659   660  Section II:Counseling  intentional injury-related deaths occur in motor vehicle crashes (see Chapter 57).1 The remainder, about 48,000 each year,1 are household, recreational, and other unintentional injuries. Falls, poisoning, fires and burns, drowning, suffocation and aspiration, firearms, and bicycling cause nearly two thirds of these deaths.9 Almost 90% of deaths relating to sports and recreation occur during swimming, boating, bicycling, riding off-road vehicles such as all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), or using firearms.9 Each year about 12,000 Americans, primarily older persons, die as a result of falls .9 Falls are the second leading cause of unintentional injury death in the U.S. (after motor vehicle injuries) and the leading cause of nonfatal injuries.5,9,10 The death rate due to falls in the general population is 5.1/100,000 persons, increasing to 10.2/100,000 for those aged 6574 and to 147.0/100,000 for persons aged 85 and over.10 Population-based studies of community-dwelling elderly persons have estimated an annual total injurious fall rate of 229/1,000 persons,11 serious fall injury rate of 8496/1,000,12 and fall injury hospitalization rate of 13.5/1,000.13 Half of serious fall injury events in elderly persons result in discharge to a nursing home.12 Hip fractures are an especially grave complication of falls in older adults, resulting in more hospital admissions than any other injury, and accounting for 254,000 hospital admissions in 1988.9 There is a 1020% reduction in expected survival in the first year following a hip fracture,1417 and roughly half of survivors never recover normal function.15 Unintentional poisonings, the third leading cause of unintentional injury deaths, account for 5,300 deaths each year, the vast majority of these among adults.9 The mortality rate for poisonings among children 04 years of age was 0.2/100,000 in 1988, a >90% decline from 1960.9 Fires and burns are the fourth leading cause of unintentional injury death in the U.S. Each year, fires and burns are responsible for at least 5,000 deaths and 1.4 million injuries.9 Residential fires account for 73% of these deaths. The lifetime cost of fire and burn injuries occurring in 1985 was estimated to be $3.8 billion.8 Nearly 5,000 Americans die each year by drowning, in cluding 1,000 boating-related drownings.9 Death rates from drowning are highest in children <5 years old and in young men aged 1524 years.10,18,19 It has been estimated that for each childhood drowning fatality, about 4 children are hospitalized and 14 are seen in the emergency department and released. 19 From 1971 to 1988, drowning rates declined substantially among older children and adolescents, but declined only slightly in toddlers and actually increased in infants.18 Some 4,700 deaths attributable to mechanical suffocation (e.g., strangulation on clothing) and aspiration of food and other foreign materials occur annually, most of these in infants and in elderly persons.9 Firearm injuries resulted in 1,740 unintentional deaths (5% of all firearm fatalities) in 1993,1 and cause 12,000 to 30,000 nonfatal injuries each year.9,20,21 BB guns and other air-powered firearms   Chapter 58: Preventing Household/Recreational Injuries  661  are estimated to injure an additional 19,50034,500 people each year.21 Bicycling injuries accounted for about 550,000 emergency room visits and 1,000 deaths annually between 1984 and 1988, mostly in children and adolescents.22 The injury rate has been estimated at 187/100,000 and the head injury rate at 5175/100,000, with peak rates occurring among children aged 514 years.22,23 Data regarding bicyclists involved in traffic crashes suggest declines in both injuries and fatalities in the last 5 years.24 Between 1982 and 1988 more than 1,100 fatalities and 400,000 emergency room-treated injuries related to ATVs were reported to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. 25 Efficacy of Risk Reduction Certain injury-specific risk factors have been identified for household and recreational injuries. These are discussed below. In general, injury control strategies based on these risk factors are derived from evidence of association observed in retrospective studies rather than from prospective trials demonstrating efficacy. There have been only a few cohort studies or clinical trials measuring the impact on injury rates of eliminating risk factors for household and recreational injuries. Children. Fires and burns were the second leading cause of unintentional injury-related death among children aged 09 years in 1991.26 Most injuries and 7590% of deaths from fires occur in residential fires.27,28 The risk of fatality in the event of a house fire is significantly increased when children <5 years old are present in the household. 29 Smoke detectors are effective in preventing deaths in residential fires. Death in a residential fire is 23 times more likely in homes without smoke detectors than in those with such devices.2931 Smoke detectors often fail to operate, however, due to incorrect installation or inadequate testing.28,32 Correct installation and periodic testing are necessary to ensure proper operation. Measures to prevent residential fires from occurring are also important for reducing fire and burn injuries. Residential fires occur more frequently in the winter, associated with the use of portable heaters, fireplaces, and Christmas trees.26,29 Some attention has been given to the hazards of certain stoves and heaters,33 but the effectiveness of clinical intervention to reduce these hazards has not been evaluated. Cigarette smoking by household members is a leading cause of residential fires, many of which may be preventable (see Adolescents and Adults , below). A large proportion of residential fire deaths in children <5 years of age is caused by children playing with matches and lighters.26 The development of child-resistant cigarette lighters has been proposed as a preventive measure.34 For children, wear ing flame-retardant clothing is effective in reducing injury from clothing ignition due to, for example, residential fires, cigarettes, matches, or lighters.10,35,36   662  Section II:Counseling  Hot tap water burns, which account for 2,600 hospitalizations each year and 24% of all scald burn hospitalizations in children, are preventable by setting household water heaters at or below 120130F.10,3739 Anti-scald devices can be installed to cut off water flow when the water temperature exceeds 120F, although their efficacy in reducing burn rates has not been evaluated adequately. In one pilot study, 85% of such devices had been removed within 9 months of installation because of sediment build-up, and there were too few outcomes to assess any impact on scald burn rates.40 The causes of drowning, and thus preventive strategies, depend on the age of the patient. In small children, 4090% of drownings (depending on locale) occur in swimming pools, usually located in the victim's backyard.4147 In about two thirds of these cases, the children are supervised by one or both parents at the time of drowning and the adult caretakers are unaware that the toddler has wandered near the pool or entered the water.42,46,48 Observational studies suggest that 5080% of such drownings can be prevented by enclosing swimming pools with 4-foot, four-sided fences with self-latching, self-closing gates that isolate the pool from the house and yard (""isolation fences"") to protect children from wandering into the pool area.42,4852a Some have recommended infant and toddler swimming lessons as a means of improving survival after submersion. The effectiveness of lessons at this age has never been proved convincingly, however;53 their safety has been questioned on the basis of case reports of water intoxication and hyponatremia.54 Bathtub-related drowning is an important problem in children <5 years old.55 The majority of infant drownings occur in bathtubs.46,47 These drownings are often associated with a history of inadequate supervision.46,47,55 Interventions to improve bathing supervision have not been evaluated, however. Immediate initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in children with submersion injury has been associated with improved outcome,44,48,56,57 suggesting that CPR training for pool owners, parents, and children's caretakers may reduce the likelihood of drowning or neurologic injury after submersion. Among children under 15 years, 3540% of firearm deaths are unintentional.21 Over 90% of firearm incidents involving children occur at home; a study in children aged 014 years found that 40% involved a firearm stored in the room where the shooting occurred.58 Persons who keep guns for the purpose of protection are more likely to keep their guns loaded,59 but for each case of a firearm being successfully used for self-protection (i.e., shooting an intruder), firearms in the home are estimated to be 1.36 times more likely to cause an unintentional fatality and 10 times more likely to cause an unintentional injury, many of these in children.21,60 The U.S. General Accounting Office estimated that nearly one third of unintentional firearm deaths might be prevented by the use of   Chapter 58: Preventing Household/Recreational Injuries  663  trigger locks and loading indicators.61 These and other potential clinical preventive strategies to prevent firearm injuries (e.g., removing guns from the home, storing weapons unloaded and in a locked compartment) would appear to be effective but have not been studied adequately. Receipt of firearm training (usually covering firearm storage) has been associated with an increased likelihood of storing guns loaded and unlocked.59 It is unknown whether this increase was because the training was ineffective, did not teach appropriate storage, or was received by persons who were inherently less likely to store firearms safely than were those who did not receive training. The association between firearm availability and violent injury is discussed in Chapters 50 and 59. A substantial proportion of childhood poisonings can be prevented by keeping medications in child-resistant containers. Federal legislation requiring such containers for aspirin, acetaminophen, prescription drugs, and household chemicals has been associated with a subsequent decrease in childhood poisoning from these substances.6264 Poisoning with children's aspirin has also been reduced by limiting the number of tablets packaged in each bottle.62,65 In contrast, poison-warning labels designed for children do not appear to be efficacious. Controlled trials have demonstrated that poison warning stickers (such as the ""Mr. Yuk"" series) do not deter children from playing with medication containers66 or reduce the rate of childhood poisoning.67 The use of aversive bittering agents may reduce ingestion of the substance to which the agent was added, 68,69 but the ability of these agents to reduce the incidence or severity of childhood poisoning is unproven. 70 Bicycling injuries are important causes of morbidity and mortality, particularly among school-age children.22 Nearly half of all Americans and 8090% of U.S. children ride bicycles.71,71a Potential interventions include wearing safety helmets, having bicycle safety training, and avoiding riding near motor vehicle traffic. Between 50% and 85% of bicycle fatalities and hospitalizations are the result of head trauma.22,72,73 Cross-sectional stud ies of persons involved in bicycling crashes suggest that bicycle helmets reduce head injuries by at least 40%.7477 Case-control studies estimate that the risk of head injury among bicyclists is reduced by 6385% by the use of bicycle helmets.78,79 Control for factors such as estimated crash severity, motor vehicle involvement, non-head injury severity, rider experience or age, or other sociodemographic characteristics, did not eliminate the pro tective effect of bicycle helmets found in these studies.78,79 In multiple time-series studies, mandatory bicycle helmet use laws and communitybased education programs have been associated with substantial increases in helmet use and with reductions in bicycle-related fatalities, head-injuries, and hospitalizations.8084 These studies provide strong support for the routine use of helmets while bicycling.   664  Section II:Counseling  An additional potential intervention to prevent bicycling injuries, bicy cle safety training, is suggested by surveys showing that many bicycle crashes among children result from cyclist error. 79,8587 One small controlled trial in children aged 89 years reported a positive short-term effect of training on bicycling behavior,88 but no controlled studies have evaluated the effectiveness of formal training in preventing crashes or injury. A recommendation for counseling bicyclists to avoid riding near motor vehicle traffic is based on evidence that some 95% of bicycle fatalities occur as a result of a collision with a motor vehicle.72,73 Efforts to separate bicyclists from motor vehicle traffic, such as designated bicycle lanes and paths, have met with some success in reducing bicycle crashes,89 although a metaanalysis based on cross-sectional and before-after studies suggested that bicycle paths may increase the risk to bicyclists at certain intersections.90 In children under age 5, falls are a common cause of injury, although few of these injuries lead to death or permanent sequelae.9,91 These injuries often involve falls from stairs or furniture.92 Baby walkers are an im portant cause of injuries in young children, many of which result from falls down stairs.9395 Collapsible gates have been advocated as a means of protecting children from stairways,92 although the efficacy of stairway gates has not been studied. Children can fall from windows even when there are screens in place. There is evidence that window guards can reduce child falls from apartment windows. 96 Adolescents and Adults. Intoxication with alcohol or other drugs and problem drinking are important risk factors for injuries and injury deaths.9,29,97104 In addition to its role in motor vehicle crashes, which has been most thoroughly studied (see Chapter 57), alcohol intoxication is involved in 40% of all fatal fires and burns and an estimated 2550% of adolescent and adult deaths from drowning, boating mishaps, and shootings, and is also associated with asphyxiation by choking.9,10,47,105108 Problem drinking by mothers has been associated with increased risk of serious injury in their children.108a Chronic alcohol abuse is a risk factor for poorer health outcome when trauma does occur.109 In national surveys, 30% of all high-school students had had five or more drinks on at least one occasion (i.e., episodic heavy drinking) during the preceding 30 days,110 and 5% of adults reported regular heavy drinking (more than five drinks per day more than five times per week).111 The large body of evidence linking alcohol intoxication to injuries, and the high prevalence of heavy drinking, argues strongly for screening for problem drinking (see Chapter 52) and for counseling on the safe use of alcohol as important measures to prevent injuries. The highest unintentional poisoning mortality rate occurs in young adult   Chapter 58: Preventing Household/Recreational Injuries  665  men (2039 years of age), who account for 40% of unintentional poisoning deaths.112 A large proportion of these deaths are attributable to overdoses of alcohol, heroin, and cocaine,9,112 at least some of which may be preventable by identification and treatment of problem drinking and illicit drug abuse (see Chapters 52 and 53). Intentional self-poisoning is discussed in Chapter 50. Drownings of adolescents and adults are most common among young males, and occur under different circumstances from those of toddlers.18,19,47,113 Most such drowning occurs in lakes, rivers, and ponds in association with water activities, including swimming, diving, boating, and fishing.47,113,114 The highest rate of fatal recreational boating incidents occurs in adolescents (8.1/million operator-hours compared to 1.0/million for all ages).115 Intoxication by alcohol or other drugs is common in both drowning and boating mishaps; about 2550% of all victims have a significant blood alcohol level, and as many as 10% have evidence of other drugs with central nervous system effects.47,113,116,117 In a national survey of adolescents and adults who participated in aquatic activities, 42% had used alcohol during such activities, with males aged 1620 reporting the highest level of alcohol consumption.118 Discouraging swimming or boating while intoxicated would therefore appear to be appropriate, but there has been little research on the impact of such a clinical intervention. More than three fourths of boating-related drownings are associated with nonuse of personal flotation devices,119 but there are few data on the impact of promoting the use of these devices. Higher rates of fatal recreational boating incidents have been associated with fewer hours of operator experience, suggesting that supervised experience and training programs might be beneficial in preventing drowning, but these have not been evaluated.115 Swimming lessons may also offer some protection against drowning, but this has never been proved convincingly. Most unintentional injuries from firearms involve adolescent and young adult males, with the highest rate of unintentional firearm deaths (3.4/100,000) occurring in males aged 1524.1,21 Unintentional firearm death rates are 4 times higher in rural compared with suburban and urban settings,9 which probably reflects increased gun ownership for hunting and recreation.120 After the home, where at least 65% of unintentional firearm injuries occur (see Children, above), the most common location for unintentional firearm injuries is the hunting site.10 In 1987, 9.2 firearm injuries were reported per 100,000 hunting licenses sold.121 These incidents often involve members of the same hunting party and result from accidental discharge or unsafe handling of the firearm, and from the victim being out of sight or mistaken for game.53,123 In a small sample of unintentional self-inflicted hunting fatalities, one third of victims had positive blood alcohol concentrations.123 National data suggest that one-fourth of injured hunters are <21 years of   666  Section II:Counseling  age.121 One population-based study found that 40% of shooters in hunting accidents were less than 20 years of age and fewer than half were supervised by adults; unsafe hunting practices such as carrying the firearm incorrectly were significantly more common in shooters who were 819 years of age.123 Hunting firearm injuries might be reduced by adult supervision of child and adolescent hunters and by wearing fluorescent orange clothing while hunting to increase visibility, but the effectiveness of these measures has not been studied adequately. Education programs for hunters on the safe use of firearms have had mixed effects on fatality rates.53 Cigarette smoking is a leading cause of fire and burn injuries and fatalities.29,124,124a Cigarette smoking causes about 25% of residential fires, usually through unintentional ignition of bedding or upholstery. Smoke detectors are effective interventions for preventing fire and burn injuries and deaths in adults as well as children (see Children, above). Many advocate counseling regarding careless smoking practices and the promotion of self-extinguishing cigarettes, neither of which has been adequately evaluated. Bicycle deaths and head injuries remain an important problem in older adolescents and young adults, with nearly 400 deaths and more than 150,000 injuries occurring each year among persons aged 1539.22 Use of bicycle helmets is an effective preventive intervention (see Children, above), yet only 7% of older adolescents and 18% of all bicyclists wear bicycle helmets sometimes or always.110,124b ATV injuries primarily occur in adolescence and young adulthood. A multivariate analysis based on nationally reported data on ATV injuries suggested that given a crash resulting in injury, helmet use reduces the risk of death by about 42%.125 Similar analyses have reported reduced risks from ATVs with smaller engines and four rather than three wheels.125,126 In 1987, the marketing and sale of three-wheeled ATVs was banned (although those already in use were not recalled), changes were made in marketing to reduce sales of larger-engined machines to children and adolescents, and educational features such as safety warnings and rebates for safety education were introduced.127 These interventions have been associated with a decline in injury rates (but not fatalities).127 Elderly Adults. Falls are the leading cause of nonfatal injuries and unintentional injury deaths in older persons in the U.S.9,10 Physiological changes with age and environmental agents are the principal risk factors for falls in older persons. Among the physiological factors that have been associated with falls are postural instability, gait disturbances, diminished muscle strength and proprioception, poor vision, cognitive impairment, number of medications, and the use of psychoactive and antihypertensive drugs.11,128136 Frail elderly persons, who have multiple physiologic deficiencies, are at significantly increased risk for falls compared with vigorous older persons.137 Environmen-   Chapter 58: Preventing Household/Recreational Injuries  667  tal risk factors identified retrospectively by fallers as contributory include stairs, pavement irregularities, slippery surfaces (including loose rugs), inadequate lighting, unexpected objects, low chairs, and incorrect footwear.128,129,138140 Controlled studies have not consistently reported significant associations between falls and environmental hazards when adjustments are made for other risk factors;128130,137 several studies suggest that risk from home hazards may vary with underlying functional status.137,141 Among the risk factors associated with injury after a fall are osteoporosis (see Chapter 46), syncope, impaired cognitive function, use of diuretics or vasodilators, and falling on hard surfaces such as concrete.129,134,142 These physiological and environmental risk factors for falls and fall injuries serve as the basis for potential preventive interventions: exercise programs to enhance strength, balance and mobility; external protection against falls on hard surfaces; monitoring and adjustment of medications; correction of environmental hazards; and measures to increase bone density (see Chapters 46 and 68). Several trials have evaluated the ability of various measures to reduce falls or risk factors for falls. The efficacy of these measures in preventing fall injuries and consequent deterioration in ambulatory function has not been fully evaluated. Randomized controlled trials of exercise programs for elderly persons have generally shown improved strength and mobility; effects on balance have been less consistent.143148 Two controlled trials of exercise programs for elderly ambulatory or institutionalized persons found no reduction in falls (although this was not a primary outcome in the latter study).143,144 These exercise programs may have been inadequate, however, since neither study reported significantly improved strength or balance as a result of the intervention. A preplanned meta-analysis of individual data from seven randomized controlled trials concluded that interventions that included an exercise component reduced the adjusted risk of falling by 10% in elderly subjects.149 Of the exercise components studied (resistance, balance, endurance, flexibility), only balance training had a significant individual effect on risk of falls. The types and modes of exercise were not standardized across trials, however. Since fall assessment was based on self-report and patients were not blinded to the intervention, the possibility of biased results exists. The meta-analysis suggested a slight nonsignificant increase in the risk of injurious falls with exercise; neither the individual trials nor the meta-analysis had sufficient sample size to assess adequately the effect of exercise on injurious falls. Only one study has evaluated external protection against falls on hard surfaces. In a trial evaluating external hip protectors fixed in special undergarments, the risk of hip fracture was reduced by 56% among elderly men and women who were resident on nursing home wards that were randomly assigned to receive the protectors.150 None of the eight intervention subjects   668  Section II:Counseling  who had a hip fracture wore the protectors at the time of the fracture; compliance with regular wearing was only 24%. Ward assignment of new arrivals could have been influenced by knowledge of the ward intervention status, potentially invalidating the randomization. There were no differences in nonhip fracture rates in the two groups, however, or in the rates of falls or falls on hips in a subset of intervention and control wards that used a prospective falls register, supporting the validity of the results. Several trials have evaluated multifactorial interventions to reduce falls and fall injury rates in elderly adults, targeted to a variety of physiologic and environmental risk factors. In a randomized controlled trial in community-dwelling persons aged 70 or older, the intervention group received medication review and adjustment, behavioral instruction and training, environmental alterations (e.g., installation of grab bars), and exercise to improve gait, balance, and strength; the interventions were delivered during multiple home visits by a nurse practitioner and a physical therapist over a 3-month period.151 Controls received a similar number of structured home visits from social-work students. At 1-year follow-up, the intervention group had a significantly longer time to first fall, smaller proportion of subjects who fell (35% vs. 47%), and lower incidence of falls (0.012 vs. 0.018 falls/person-week), with favorable trends for falls requiring medical care and falls resulting in serious injury. In multivariate analy sis, the risk of falling declined by 11% for each 1.0 decrease in the number of fall-related risk factors. No adverse effects from the intervention were reported except self-limited musculoskeletal symptoms in 7% of subjects. In the institutional setting, multidisciplinary postfall assessment designed to address a variety of risk factors for falls substantially reduced subsequent falls in a small uncontrolled experiment. 152 A randomized controlled trial of postfall assessment in a nursing home, however, found little effect on falls.153 The assessment did significantly reduce hospitalizations and hospital days, suggesting that falls served mainly as a marker for treatable underlying disorders. Additional trials related to preventing falls and fall injuries in elderly persons are currently under way.154 Another leading cause of unintentional injury death in persons over 65 years of age is asphyxiation by choking from foreign materials in the respiratory tract, with 2,500 deaths annually, including 270 in institutions.9 Poor dentition, use of sedative drugs, dementia, and reduced motor coordination may contribute to this high rate.9 Interventions such as correcting denture fit, adjusting medications, dietary changes related to food size and consistency, and training those who care for elderly persons in use of the Heimlich maneuver and cardiopulmonary resuscitation may be effective interventions, but data evaluating these or other interventions to prevent aspiration and asphyxiation are lacking.   Chapter 58: Preventing Household/Recreational Injuries  669  Fires and burns are also leading causes of death in older adults.9,155 Compared with younger hospitalized burn victims, the mortality rate is higher for elderly hospitalized burn patients (0.4 vs. 2.6 deaths/100,000 person-years).156 The risk of fatality in the event of a house fire is significantly increased when persons over 65 years old are present in the household.29 Older persons may be at increased risk of dying in residential fires because of impaired vision, hearing, mobility, or mental status, which can lead to greater difficulty in avoiding burns.29 More than three fourths of deaths from clothing ignition occur among persons aged 65 and older, which may be due in part to decreased coordination in handling cigarettes, lighters, etc.9,155 Smoking materials have been implicated in 10% of severe burn injuries and 33% of residential-fire deaths among elderly persons.26,156 Scald burns account for 42% of hospitalizations for burn injuries in persons aged 65 years and older and primarily involve hot tap water, food, and drinks.156 Interventions similar to those discussed for children and younger adults are likely to be effective in preventing fire and burn injuries in elderly adults (see above). Efforts to improve mobility, coordination, and sensory function may also be effective in reducing burn injuries, although these have not been evaluated. Effectiveness of Counseling The most effective measures to control injuries are passive interventions, those that do not rely on the potential victim to adopt new behaviors voluntarily. Examples of effective passive interventions include window guards in high-rise apartments, nonflammable sleepwear, automatic sprinkler systems, and child-resistant packaging to prevent poisoning.157 Since injury prevention advice from clinicians usually requires active cooperation from patients (e.g., changing smoking practices in bed, installing and testing smoke detectors), counseling faces inherent limitations. It is there fore not surprising that counseling is most effective in combination with other measures that promote compliance, such as safety regulations.96,158 Children. Clinical counseling by itself appears to be of some benefit when offered to parents of young children. 159 Only a few studies have evaluated the effects of counseling on injury rates as well as on knowledge and behavior. A small randomized controlled trial found that parents who received an individualized course on child safety during well-baby visits demonstrated greater knowledge about home hazards and had fewer hazards in the home when tested 1 month after the last visit; there was no difference in the rate of injuries reported by the parents or recorded in hospital records. 160 A nonrandomized controlled trial found that infants   670  Section II:Counseling  of mothers who received counseling on fall prevention had fewer falls over the course of a year than did those whose mothers were not counseled.161 In a controlled demonstration project, clinical counseling resulted in significantly improved knowledge and behavior related to poisoning prevention, but had no effect on poisoning rates.162 In a w ell- designed prospective cohort study, the children of urban, adolescent mothers who reported having received home safety information at 3 months postpartum were half as likely to have been injured at follow-up about 1 year later.163 There was a dose-response relationship between the number of home safety information sources and reduced injury risk; 71% reported receiving their information from health professionals. Several ecologic studies that included both primary care and community interventions have reported improvements in safety knowledge and behavior compared to con trol communities; significant improvements or favorable trends in injury rates were also reported in the intervention communities.164166 A number of other trials have assessed behavioral outcomes related to injury prevention. A randomized controlled trial found that couples who received information on burn prevention during well-child care classes were more likely to have their hot water heaters set at 130F or lower when checked by investigators during a home visit. 167 In a nonrandomized trial, parents who received counseling along with the opportunity to purchase a smoke detector at cost were more likely to have an operational smoke detector 46 weeks later, compared with controls.168 In another small nonrandomized trial of low-income parents, those who received detailed safety advice during a home visit by a health worker were found to have corrected significantly more home hazards compared to controls.169 Education has also been shown to motivate parents to obtain syrup of ipecac, to display poison control center telephone numbers, and to learn more about the proper use of ipecac.170172 Thus, the evidence supports a beneficial effect of clinician counseling on safety-related knowledge and behavior. It is less clear from direct evidence whether counseling results in lower injury rates. Not all studies have found counseling parents to be effective in promoting safety. One randomized controlled trial found that a program providing mothers with counseling on household hazards, a safety booklet, and free safety devices was unsuccessful in changing either the knowledge of the subjects or the number of home hazards detected in an unannounced home visit, although in this study the counseling was administered by a research assistant rather than a clinician.173 To be effective, safety counseling may have to be provided by the patient's own clinician, as suggested by one descriptive study.174 A population-based nonrandomized controlled trial found little effect on preventive behaviors of a brief nurse counseling intervention, but contamination of the comparison group may have occurred   Chapter 58: Preventing Household/Recreational Injuries  671  because the same nurses saw study and control groups in alternating weeks.175 The limited benefit from parent counseling reported in these studies may therefore have been due to their methodologic limitations. Some researchers have attempted to prevent childhood injuries through free distribution of injury control devices during the clinic visit. When free smoke detectors were made available in one program, 92% of the recipients installed the devices and 88% of these were found to be operational 49 months later.176 Distributing a liquid-crystal thermometer along with office counseling increased the likelihood of testing tap water temperature compared to counseling alone, but both groups were equally likely to report lowering the thermostat.177 In another study, free distribution of cabinet locks and electrical outlet covers resulted in increased use of outlet covers, which are easy to apply, but no increase in the installation of cabinet locks, a more inconvenient task requiring minimal carpentry skills.178 Similarly, providing a free slide-style cabinet lock and telephone stickers significantly increased their use, while a discount coupon for syrup of ipecac (which required a visit to a pharmacy to purchase) did not increase the likelihood of having ipecac on hand.179 Adolescents and Adults. Evidence on counseling to prevent household and recreational injuries to adolescents and young or middle-aged adults is quite limited. Two randomized controlled trials directed to young adolescents and their parents evaluated brief physician counseling addressing awareness of bicycling injury risk and helmet efficacy and found only a slight, nonsignificant increase in bicycle helmet purchases.180,181 The counseling intervention was designed primarily to increase awareness and was probably inadequate to induce behavioral change (see Chapter iv). A comprehensive review revealed no other studies specifically evaluating household or recreational injury prevention counseling of adolescents or younger adults in the primary care setting. Counseling middle-aged men who were heavy drinkers to reduce alcohol consumption substantially reduced hospital days for accidents and injuries at 25-year follow-up of a randomized controlled trial,182 although it is not clear whether this was due to a reduction in injury events or in complications once an injury occurred. The effectiveness of identifying and counseling persons with problem drinking is described in detail in Chapter 52. Elderly Adults . A number of trials have evaluated counseling elders to reduce the risk of household and other unintentional injuries, although none involved counseling within the context of the routine office visit. A randomized controlled trial enrolling public health clients 65 years compared the effects of safety education (including falls prevention and fire safety) delivered during a public health nurse home visit to control (influenza) education delivered in the same manner.183 At 23-month follow-up, there   672  Section II:Counseling  were no differences between the two groups in the proportion of subjects reporting they had made safety changes in the home (22% vs. 18%) or in the mean number of safety changes made (0.35 vs. 0.26). Effects on injuries were not assessed. Three randomized controlled trials have evaluated the effects of counseling interventions on falls and fall injuries, one involving home visits and two conducted among elderly volunteers belonging to health maintenance organizations (HMOs). A large trial conducted within a general practice randomly assigned all households with patients aged 70 years and older to usual care or to receive a home health visit at least once a year that included risk assessment for falls; counseling on diet, medications, syncope, and environmental hazards; referrals as needed; and weekly fitness classes.184 At 4-year follow-up, there were no differences between intervention and control groups in the proportions who reported falls (28% vs. 20%) or fractures due to falls (5% vs. 4%) during the study period. One HMO trial evaluated the effects of four weekly, 90-minute group counseling sessions led by a health behaviorist and a physical therapist and focused on exercise and measures to reduce environmental hazards and behavioral risks, followed by quarterly maintenance sessions; financial and technical assistance to make safety repairs was also offered.185 The intervention reduced the odds of falling by 15%, but had little effect on the probability or number of injury falls or of falls requiring medical treatment. Neither the odds of falling nor number of falls was significantly related to the number of sessions attended by intervention subjects, but analysis suggested that those with a higher underlying fall risk were more likely to attend. The other HMO trial randomly assigned 1559 elderly volunteers to one of three groups: usual care, a 6090-minute visit with a nurse to discuss chronic disease prevention, or a 6090-minute visit with a nurse/educator who performed fall-related risk assessment and screening, developed tailored recommendations for preventing falls (e.g., medication review, exercise, alcoholism treatment, home safety inspection), and made 12 follow-up calls.186 Compared to usual care, the intervention significantly reduced the percentage of subjects reporting falls and injurious falls, with favorable trends for medically attended and hospitalized falls, at 1-year follow-up, but differences disappeared by the end of 2 years. It is unclear how much of the reduction in falls at 1-year follow-up can be attributed to the intervention: similar reductions were seen in the control nurse visit group, and the intervention had no effect on the prevalence of any fall-related behaviors except the receipt of a home safety inspection. Whether the effects of home visits or of fairly intensive interventions in volunteers who belong to HMOs can be extrapolated to routine clinician counseling in the office setting is unclear. In all three of the trials assessing fall outcomes, falls were self-reported, possibly leading to biased reporting of falls due to knowledge of intervention assignment.   Chapter 58: Preventing Household/Recreational Injuries  673  Adverse Effects of Injury Prevention Counseling. Injury prevention counseling has not been associated with adverse effects in any trials. Concern has been raised that injury control counseling may be harmful in some patients, such as adolescents. 53 Several investigators have hypothesized that adolescents who favor risk-taking behavior may respond to certain health information (i.e., drug and sex education) by performing activities that increase risk, 187189 but no direct evidence to support this hypothesis, either for injury or other conditions, was found.  Recommendations of Other Groups Specific recommendations for office-based counseling on household and recreational injury prevention have been issued by the American Academy of Pediatrics,190 the American Academy of Family Physicians,191 the Bright Futures project, 192 the American Medical Association Guidelines for Adolescent Preventive Services (GAPS),193 and the Public Health Service.193a Clinicians are advised by these groups to provide age-specific injury prevention counseling, which may include the following: install and maintain smoke detectors in the home, safely store matches and lighters and avoid smoking near bedding or upholstery; set hot water temperatures to 120130F; install window and stairway guards/gates and discourage use of infant walkers; supervise young children in the bathtub and all children when swimming, install isolation fences around swimming pools, learn CPR, learn how to swim, and avoid alcohol use during water-related activities; avoid keeping guns or keep guns unloaded and stored in locked cabinets separate from ammunition; purchase and use bicycle helmets; safely store medicines and household products and acquire syrup of ipecac; correct home hazards related to falls; and follow other recommendations on injury prevention. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends injury prevention counseling on safety helmets, recreational hazards, and firearms for all women.193b The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that all persons wear bicycle helmets whenever and wherever they ride a bicycle.194 The Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination recommends counseling parents to recognize home hazards, use smoke detectors and nonflammable sleepwear, reduce hot water thermostat settings, keep ipecac on hand, and know the poison control center telephone number, but it found insufficient evidence to recommend parent counseling to prevent drowning or bicycling injuries.195 The Canadian Task Force found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against counseling adults (other than parents) to prevent household and recreational injuries.   674  Section II:Counseling  Discussion There is good evidence from controlled trials that counseling the parents of young children can increase safety-related behaviors (e.g., lowering hot water temperatures, reducing home hazards, installing smoke detectors), and fair evidence from multiple observational studies that certain safety behaviors are associated with reduced childhood injuries. A chain of evidence can thus be constructed to support a recommendation that parents of children be counseled to prevent household and recreational injuries, even though the evidence is less strong for a direct effect of clinician safety counseling on injury rates. There is clearly room for substantial improvement in the implementation of childhood injury prevention measures: in a national survey of households with children, only 67% had functional smoke detectors, 50% knew the Poison Control Center number, 26% had ipecac on hand, and 9% had hot water temperature known to be below 125F.196 The prevalence of all these measures decreased with decreasing level of education and income. High cost and limited access to recommended protective devices,197 the need for technical skills to install certain devices, and living in rental units should be recognized as important barriers to implementing childhood injury prevention advice that particularly affect low-income households. No trials of counseling or other interventions in elderly adults have demonstrated significant reductions in serious fall injuries, but there is strong observational evidence of the association between falls and mortality and serious morbidity in the elderly, indicating that interventions that reduce falls are likely to improve clinical outcomes. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials indicates that exercise (especially balance training) can reduce the risk of falls in elderly persons by about 10%. An intensive multifactorial intervention that directly addressed physiologic and environmental risk factors during regular home visits also reduced the likelihood of falling in high-risk community-dwelling elders, although substantial resources were required that may not be available in all settings. Whether clinician advice to exercise or to address fall risk factors will reduce falls or fall injuries is less clear. Weekly group counseling sessions or detailed individualized counseling by health workers trained to address physiological, behavioral, and environmental risk factors leads to modest short-term reductions in fall risk. These interventions may not be generalizable to brief advice delivered in the office setting, however, and direct evidence of a reduction in fall injuries with counseling is lacking. Periodic counseling of elderly persons to exercise and to address environmental and behavioral risk factors for falls is thus supported by fair evidence that these measures will reduce falls and thereby reduce fall-related injuries, although the effectiveness of counseling patients to exercise and to address these risk factors has not been established. There is fair evidence to   Chapter 58: Preventing Household/Recreational Injuries  675  recommend an intensive multifactorial fall prevention intervention for community-dwelling elders at high risk for falls, in settings where adequate resources to deliver this intervention are available. In institutionalized elderly persons, there is evidence from one trial that the use of external hip protectors reduces hip fracture rates. Confirmation of these results is needed, but the large potential benefit and lack of adverse effects support their use. At present, such protectors are not widely available nor have these devices been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Compliance with wearing the protectors was poor in institutionalized elderly. Whether community-dwelling elders would comply with wearing similar protectors is questionable; further research to address compliance is therefore necessary. Postfall as ses sment and multifactorial intervention for institutionalized elderly does not appear to reduce falls, but can be recommended on the basis of other significant health benefits unrelated to injuries. Although there are few injury control measures for adolescents and younger adults for which there is conclusive evidence of efficacy, and the effectiveness of injury control counseling of adults is largely unstudied, counseling by physicians on these matters may be justified because of the enormous burden of suffering associated with injuries. Thus, even minor reductions in their incidence can have large public health benefits. The cost of physician time to deliver injury prevention counseling may be kept to a minimum by conducting counseling during clinical encounters and focusing attention on specific injuries for which the patient is at greatest risk and on preventive strategies for which the strongest evidence of efficacy is available. For adolescents and adults, intoxication by alcohol and other drugs appears to be most strongly associated with the risk of unintentional injury or death, and there is fair evidence that counseling for problem drinking is effective (see Chapter 52). Additional measures likely to prevent household and recreational injuries to adolescents and adults include smoking cessation (see Chapter 54), proper installation and testing of smoke detectors, and wearing bicycle and ATV safety helmets. The solutions to many injury problems may require intervention both at the individual level (i.e., in the clinical setting) and at the community, state or national level. There are numerous examples of public health education programs and legislation that have proved effective in promoting safe behavior and preventing injuries.36,39,64,80,81,84,96,198,199 Measures likely to be even more effective in preventing injuries involve re-engineering the household environment or products (e.g., residential sprinkler systems, hot water heaters preset to 125 at the factory32,34), because these measures do not depend on voluntary behavior changes. Such re-engineering can also be achieved through legislation. In many communities, physicians and other health professionals have provided leadership for effective commu-   676  Section II:Counseling  nity programs and legislation to reduce injury morbidity and mortality.39,64,200,201 Clinicians may wish to consider playing an advocacy role as a means of preventing household and recreational injuries, while continuing to support behavior change with clinical interventions. CLINICAL INTERVENTION  Counseling the parents of children on measures to reduce the risk of unintentional injuries from residential fires and hot tap water, drowning, poisoning, bicycling, firearms, and falls is reco mmended (""B"" recommendation). Persons with alcohol or drug problems should be iden tified, counseled, and monitored, and referred for treatment as appropri ate (see Chapters 52 and 53); all adolescents and adults who use alcohol or other drugs should be advised to avoid engaging in potentially dangerous activities (e.g., swimming, boating, handling of firearms, smoking in bed, hunting, bicycling) while intoxicated (""B"" recommendation). Counseling regarding other measures to prevent household and recreational injuries is recommended for adolescent and adult (including elderly) patients based on fair evidence for the efficacy of risk reduction (""B"" recommen dation), although the effectiveness of such counseling has not been adequately evaluated (""C"" recommendation). The need to prevent household or recreational injuries should be discussed regularly with patients, although the optimal frequency for such counseling has not been deter mined and is left to clinical discretion. Clinicians should remain alert to the possibility of abuse or neglect as the etiology of certain household and recreational injuries (see Chapter 51). Illicit drug use, an important risk factor for adolescent and adult poisonings, is discussed in Chapter 53. See also Chapter 50 (suicide), Chapter 57 (motor vehicle and pedestrian in juries), and Chapter 59 (violent injuries). Specific recommendations to prevent injuries to children include the following measures, many of which are also likely to be effective in pre venting injuries to adolescents and adults (including elderly persons). Homeowners should be advised to install smoke detectors in appropriate locations and to test the devices periodically to ensure proper operation. Infants and children should wear flame-resistant nightwear during sleep. Smokers should be advised to cease or reduce smoking (see Chapter 54). Hot water heaters should be set at 120130F. Parents, grandparents, or other patients with children in the home should be advised to keep a 1ounce bottle of syrup of ipecac, to display the telephone number of the local poison control center, and to place all medications, toxic substances, and matches in child-resistant containers. Bicyclists and parents of children who ride bicycles should be counseled about the importance of wearing approved safety helmets 194 and avoiding riding in motor vehicle   Chapter 58: Preventing Household/Recreational Injuries  677  traffic. Children and adolescents who ride all-terrain vehicles, and their parents, should be advised to use approved safety helmets and fourwheeled (rather than three-wheeled) machines with smaller engines. Fam ilies should be encouraged to install 4-foot four-sided isolation fences with self-latching, self-closing gates around swimming pools, and window guards on windows in buildings that pose high risk for falls. Swimming pool owners and individuals living with or caring for young children or elderly persons should be encouraged to learn cardiopulmonary resuscitation and maneuvers to manage choking incidents. Although there is at present only limited evidence to support removing firearms from the home or keeping them unloaded in a locked compartment for the preven tion of unintentional injuries, this intervention can be recommended based on its efficacy for the prevention of violent injuries (see Chapters 50 and 59). Additional interventions likely to be effective but for which there is currently limited evidence of benefit include: avoiding smoking near bedding or upholstery and unsafe handling of smoking materials, installing collapsible gates or other barriers to stairway entrances, observing safe boating practices and wearing personal flotation devices while boat ing, and wearing orange fluorescent clothing while hunting. Poison-warn ing stickers intended to deter children from playing with containers of medicine or other poisons (e.g., ""Mr. Yuk"" stickers) have been found to be ineffective and are not recommended (""D"" recommendation). Counseling elderly patients on measures to reduce the risk of falling, including exercise (particularly training to improve balance), safety-related skills and behaviors, and environmental hazard reduction, along with monitoring and adjusting medications, is recommended based on fair evidence that these measures reduce the likelihood of falling (""B"" recom mendation), although the effectiveness of routinely counseling elders to prevent falls has not been adequately evaluated (""C"" recommendation). Recommendations for regular physical activity in elderly patients without contraindications can also be made based on other proven benefits (see Chapter 55). Intensive individualized home-based multifactorial intervention to reduce the risk of falls is recommended for high-risk elderly pa tients in settings where adequate resources are available to deliver such services (""B"" recommendation). Elderly persons at high risk for falls in clude those aged 75 years and older; or aged 7074 with one or more additional risk factors including: use of certain psychoactive and cardiac medications (e.g., benzodiazepines, antihypertensives); use of 4 prescription medications; impaired cognition, strength, balance, or gait. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the routine use of external hip protectors to prevent fall injuries (""C"" recommendation). Once these devices become generally available, recommendations for   678  Section II:Counseling  their use in institutionalized elderly may be made on other grounds, in cluding the large potential benefit and limited adverse effects. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against postfall assessment and intervention in institutionalized elderly persons in order to prevent falls (""C"" recommendation), but recommendations for such interventions may be made on the basis of other benefits, including reduced hospitalizations and hospital days unrelated to falls. For other recommendations relevant to fall injuries in the elderly, see Chapter 33 (screening for visual impair ment), Chapter 46 (screening for postmenopausal osteoporosis), Chapter 48 (screening for dementia), Chapter 55 (counseling to promote physical activity), and Chapter 68 (hormone replacement therapy).

During the period 1990-94, Spain produced around 84,000 million cigarettes per year and imported around 1,800 million cigarettes. From 1993-94, Spain exported around 2,500 million cigarettes per year. In 1992, Spain received US$ 117 million in tobaccogrowing subsidies from the EU. In 1993, Spain spent around US$ 350 million (0.32% of total import costs) on tobacco products, while earning around US$ 41 million (0.04% of total export earnings) from tobacco.    Industry  In 1993, Spain's stateowned tobacco company had a staff of around 7,850 employees. Government revenue from tobacco taxes in 1993 was US$ 2.8 billion.       Tobacco consumption    The majority of tobacco consumed in Spain is in the form of manufactured cigarettes. A relatively small amount of finecut tobacco is sold in Spain. During the period 1990-92, annual adult (age 15+) per capita consumption averaged around 2,670, an increase form the early 1970s, when it averaged around 2,190. However, it has been estimated that by 1993, per capita consumption had fallen to around 2,400. However, this apparent decline may be explained largely by a reported increase in sales of smuggled cigarettes.                               Consumption of Manufactured Cigarettes                                                    Annual average per adult (15+)                                1970-72                     2,190                                1980-82                     2,440                                1990-92                     2,670                 Tar/nicotine/ filters  According to EU legislation, cigarettes have to contain less than 15 mg of tar from 1993 and will have to contain less than 12 mg of tar from 1998. In 1994, 98% of the cigarettes produced in Spain were filter-tipped.    Relative cost of cigarettes  The average hourly gross salary for an industrial worker in 1992 was US$ 8.40, enough to buy 13 packs of cigarettes. Thus, it would take only around 5 minutes of labour to purchase a pack of 20 cigarettes. In 1995, relative to the cost of living, cigarettes in Spain were the cheapest in the EU.       Prevalence    National smoking prevalence has declined from 40% in 1978 to 36% in 1993. However, in the same period, the percentage of male smokers declined from 65% to 48%, but the prevalence of smoking among women increased from 17% to 25%.    Tobacco use among population sub-groups  A 1986 survey in Catalonia found a smoking prevalence among physicians of 52%. Among women, smoking prevalence appears to increase in conjunction with socio-economic status.    Age patterns  In 1993, smoking prevalence was highest among men in the 25-44 year age group (57%). Among women, smoking rates were highest among 18-24 year olds (38%), and among 25-44 year olds (34%). Smoking was far less common among women over the age of 45 years, with only 9% of women aged 45-65 smoking (compared to 44% of men in the same age group.          Mortality from Tobacco Use    Around 1950, the absolute level of male and female lung cancer rates in Spain was very similar )10/100,000 for males, 5/100,000 for females). By 1991, the rate for women had remained unchanged (at about the level of non-smoking women in populations where data are available), whereas lung cancer mortality among men had risen seven-fold to almost 79/100,000. Moreover, lung cancer in Spanish men is continuing to increase rapidly, as is the number of smoking attributable deaths. In 1995, an estimated 46,000 men died from tobacco, up from 7,200 in 1955. Between 1950 and 2000, it is estimated that tobacco will have been the cause of about 1,250,000 deaths among Spanish men, almost 700,000 of which occurred before age 70 years.            Tobacco control measures    Control of tobacco products  Tobacco advertising is banned on television and radio, but radio advertising is allowed for new lowtar and lownicotine brands for a two year period following the launch. Voluntary restrictions agreed up by the Minister of Health and representatives of the tobacco industry also contain some provisions: a ban on sales of tobacco to children under 16 years; ban of the sale of tobacco in health or educational establishments, or any establishment especially aimed at children or young people; ban on the use of vending machines by children under age 16; cigarette vending machines must carry a health warning of a specified size. Sales of oral tobacco products have been banned since 1992. The EU legislation on labelling, with mandatory health warnings and listing of tar and nicotine contents, has been implemented into Spanish law. In 1995, taxes on cigarettes represented 72% of the retail price.    Protection for non-smokers  Smoking is banned in such public places as health facilities, educational establishments, public administration premises, welfare establishments for children under age 16, premises for public entertainment, urban and long-distance vehicles, domestic flights shorter than 90 minutes, and in workplaces where smoking may pose an increased health risk such as for pregnant women.    Health Education  Ministry of Health activities on tobacco are carried out as part of the Health for All programmes in Spain. The main objective is to reduce smoking prevalence by at least 18% by the year 2000. The National Plan on Prevention and Control of Cancer also includes measures against tobacco use. The Ministry of Health enlists the cooperation of other Ministries in its tobacco activities However, Spain consists of 17 autonomous regions, making a national approach to tobacco control difficult. In the mid 1990s, pilot programmes aimed at reducing smoking in schools, workplaces and the public health service are slowly gaining political interest and support. There is also focused attention on educating young people, pregnant women, teachers and health professionals about the dangers of smoking, and to support cessation efforts for those who smoke. Spain celebrates World No-Tobacco Day each year. In 1995, the National Committee for the Prevention of Tobacco Consumption was formed. The Spanish Association against Cancer also organizes activities aimed at reducing smoking.       Previous Country  |  Europe  |  Next Country
GX030-60-8047092	"Kyrgyzstan          >> Regional Overview    >> Kyrgyzstan Overview          Activity Data Sheet   PROGRAM:   Kyrgyzstan   TITLE & NUMBER:  Increased Utilization of Quality Primary Health Care for Select Populations, 116-032   STATUS:   New   PROPOSED FY 2001 OBLIGATION AND FUNDING SOURCE:   $2,300,000 FSA   PROPOSED FY 2002 OBLIGATION AND FUNDING SOURCE:   $2,600,000 FSA   INITIAL OBLIGATION:   FY 2001   ESTIMATED COMPLETION DATE:   FY 2005    Summary : Kyrgyzstan is a leader in the Central Asia region in health care reform.  Through this strategic objective, USAID will continue build an effective, affordable, and sustainable primary health care (PHC) system, that meets the health needs of families and to strengthen programs for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases (ID). Health professionals are being re-trained to provide quality health care. Health professionals' clinical and laboratory skills will be upgraded to better diagnose, treat and prevent illness, including infectious diseases, such as acute respiratory infections, tuberculosis (TB), HIV/AIDS and hepatitis.    Program Categories  include support for infectious disease prevention, and maternal/child health.    Key Results : Four key results are necessary to achieve this objective : 1) select populations are better informed about personal health care rights and responsibilities; 2) improved quality of health care including infectious diseases and maternal and child health; 3) improved use of health care resources for primary health care; and 4) improved legislative, regulatory and policy framework.     Performance and Prospects : After six years of assistance, USAID continues to achieve outstanding results in the health sector. Exercising rights and responsibilities are themes that excite people in Kyrgyzstan who are participating in the changes in their health care system. Approximately one million citizens of Bishkek and Chui regions exercised their right to choose their doctors through USAID-supported re-enrollment campaigns in late 2000.     The Ministry of Health (MOH) is supporting citizens' rights to information as well as their right to comment on programs affecting them. In 2000 USAID assisted the MOH to develop a national public awareness campaign to inform the public about the next phase of health reform and to get people involved in the process. The population was educated about a new benefits package that identifies those essential services that the Government of Kyrgyzstan (GOKG) plans to provide without cost. Public comment was critical because the draft package listed services that the GOKG can realistically provide, rather than the universal free services that have been decreed but have not been free in years.    People are also becoming accustomed to receiving health information from their family doctors and nurses. In a recent Public Satisfaction Survey, 70% of respondents noticed improved health promotion work, 83% found an increase in the scope of services available to them in PHC and 61% noted improvement in the quality of services after family doctors were retrained and passed accreditation exams. Overall, 91% were satisfied with the services they received.    Updated training of health care personnel contributes to improved quality.  More than 1,400 physicians (most of whom are women) have completed a 2-year standard family medicine training program, passed exams, and been state-certified as family doctors.  This year, the Family Medicine Training Center launched a one-year residency program with 14 post- graduate students. In addition, through partnership activities, USAID assisted the Kyrgyzstan State Medical Academy to create new departments in health management and higher nursing education.    USAID initiated its efforts to improve the health care delivery system in Issyk-Kul Oblast six years ago, and the process is now well-advanced, including extensive training on acute respiratory infection (ARI) and control of diarrheal diseases, accompanied by monitoring of performance. For the first time in 10 years, ARI has dropped from first to second place as a cause of infant mortality, a trend that will be observed to determine whether it is sustained over time.    USAID assisted the Government to obtain Hepatitis B vaccine. This will enable the GOKG to decrease the levels of acute, chronic and fatal liver diseases by stopping transmission of Hepatitis B to infants. USAID continues to support strengthening of the National Infectious Disease Reference Laboratory and three sentinel surveillance sites that were established for disease specific surveillance, vaccination program monitoring and viral hepatitis control in Kyrgyzstan. This laboratory has received authority from the Ministry of Health to license local level infectious disease diagnostic laboratories to ensure the quality of the laboratory work. Through the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-supported training, a core group of infectious disease professionals titled ""The Central Asian Epidemiology Network (CAR EPI NET)"" was established, strengthening capacity for surveillance and outbreak investigation, as well as training of trainers activities.    The GOKG continues to be a pioneer in health reform in the NIS. In the area of health finance, massive restructuring is taking place. At the district level, the Health Department has been abolished. Health purchaser and health provider functions have been split, with the Health Insurance Fund as the purchaser and the newly created oblast Merged General Hospital as the provider. The Merged General Hospital will incorporate specialty hospitals into its administrative structure as well as its physical plant, when feasible. This change has great potential to increase efficiency and decrease administrative and facility operating costs by eliminating duplication. In addition, two pilot budget projects are underway to create a single payer system by merging budget and health insurance funds into a single pool to allow greater flexibility to the purchaser in buying services.    At the national level, the Health Information Center has replaced the Health Statistics Department and been merged under the Health Insurance Fund so that health information systems are now tied to provider payment systems. This financial connection gives providers an incentive to submit good data that can be used for payments, health statistics, quality assurance, research and monitoring and evaluation. Other developments include an outpatient drug benefit being tested as part of the new proposed health benefits package. If successful, this could make drugs more accessible at the PHC level and decrease the motivation to hospitalize solely to obtain free drugs.    In 2001, with the benefit of additional funds, USAID will develop an HIV program prevention with a behavioral risk assessment, condom social marketing, a high-level regional conference, a pilot project to explore STI treatment approaches using the World Health Organization (WHO)-developed Syndromic Management approach, prevention interventions with high-risk groups and much-needed information campaigns at the community level.    Regarding TB control, WHO and the World Bank (WB) have taken the lead. However, after initial promising results, TB mortality increased from 18.4 per 100,000 in 1998 to 21.3 in 1999. From discussions with donors and the GOKG, as well as results of USAID-supported laboratory monitoring visits, USAID has agreed to significantly increase support for the TB Directly Observed Treatment Short-course (DOTS) program.    In FY 2001, USAID intends to obligate, for technical assistance and training activities, the following amounts per category: Infectious Disease Prevention, $1,800,000 and Maternal/Child Health, $500,000.    In FY 2002, USAID will continue to deepen, broaden, and fully implement health care reforms.  USAID will also continue to support efforts to better diagnose, treat and prevent infectious diseases such as TB and HIV/AIDS.     Beneficiaries :  The primary beneficiaries are health professionals working in primary health care and infectious disease. The ultimate beneficiaries are users of these health services, who are predominantly women and children.    Possible Adjustments to Plans : Due to a high level of indebtedness, the World Bank Health II loan start date is uncertain and could lead to delays in key procurements, infrastructure development and technical assistance. USAID planned expansion of improved PHC to South Kyrgyzstan could be affected. Political will and support for change could be eroded, particularly in the area of restructuring of the Sanitary and Epidemiologic Services and in rationalizing the tertiary facilities in the capital city, Bishkek.    Other Donor Programs : The World Bank and Asian Development Bank have large health sector loans, specifically in health sector reform. WHO and Germany are active on TB control and Integrated Management of Childhood Illness programs. The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) supports the GOKG in vaccine procurement. United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) procures contraceptives for the public sector.    Principal Contractors, Grantees, or Agencies : Implementing partners include Abt Associates/ZdravPlus, American International Health Alliance (AIHA), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Counterpart Consortium, and Project Hope.

GX266-74-8259281	"REPORT TO THE GOVERNOR AND GENERAL ASSEMBLY  IOWA CHILD DEATH REVIEW TEAM December 2002  Administrative Support Provided by: IOWA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH  Thomas J. Vilsack, Governor  Sally J. Pederson, Lt. Governor   Foreword Lon Walker, Chairperson  It may appear promising that Iowa child deaths were down from 472 in 2000 to 432 in 2001. Unfortunately, teen suicides increased from 18 to 23 during that time period and included one nine year old. In addition, Iowa continued to lose children to preventable traffic crashes, other accidents and homicides. The number of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) deaths remained fairly steady at 37 in 2001, as compared to 38 the previous year. However, we should be able to lower the number of SIDS deaths through enhanced education for new families that centers on three risk factors identified in the majority of the SIDS deaths we reviewed: improper sleep environment, prenatal smoke exposure and secondhand smoke exposure. The team, formed by the Legislature in 1995, has now created a database with extensive information on several thousand deaths. Decisions based on that information would make a difference in reducing deaths of Iowa's children. It is also important to fund the Iowa Child Death Review Team to ensure its ability to continue advising on the protection and enhanced safety of Iowa's most important resource, our children. Based on solid data and extensive reviews, the Iowa Child Death Review Team has identified several ways many child deaths could be prevented. We have made recommendations in our 7 previous reports and again in this report that, if implemented, would help reduce child deaths. We are hopeful that we will see action taken this year to make Iowa a safer place for our children to live. If we truly are serious about making a difference, now is the time to act!  1   Executive Summary The Iowa Child Death Review Team (CDRT) was created by legislation passed in 1995. The team's first meeting took place in December of that year. Six of the original members and four of the original state agency liaisons still serve on the CDRT. As required by law, the team has published an annual report each year that summarizes its findings based on the previous year's case reviews. Since cases are reviewed retrospectively to assure all investigative and medical materials are complete and available, this year's report is based on child deaths (birth  17 years) occurring in calendar year 2001. During 2001, 432 child deaths occurred among Iowa's child residents dying in or out of state and child residents of other states or countries dying in Iowa. All of the homicide, accident and suicide deaths, as well as many of the undetermined and natural manner deaths could have been prevented through better public education, different attitudes and actions by care providers and/or improved intervention by an outside entity. The recommendations made by the CDRT can not assure the total safety of every child who lives within the state's boundaries or who visits Iowa, but they could potentially improve the chances that all of these children would live to adulthood. For Iowa's children to be assured a longer and safer life, the legislature, state and other public agencies and all care providers of children would need to take action on the team's recommendations. Such action has been slow to occur. The team continues to promote the recommendations and urge passage of legislation that would offer children a more secure future. In addition, the CDRT advises that entities involved in parenting and child-care provider education adopt the education-related suggestions and actively incorporate them into their education initiatives. Natural deaths continued to be the leading cause of child deaths in 2001. The vast majority of these deaths occurred during the first month of life. Most of the natural deaths resulted from premature birth or birth defects. Better and earlier prenatal care and smoking cessation would improve the chances that infants would not be born prematurely. Birth defects would be decreased as well if pregnant women and those around them did not smoke. Iowa is improving in the fight against these deaths. In 2000, there were 286 natural manner deaths. Of these deaths, prematurity caused 111 and congenital defects caused 91. In 2001, prematurity caused 92, and congenital defects caused 116 of the 262 natural deaths. Accidents are the leading cause of death for older children. In 2001, 84 children died from accidents as compared to 102 in 2000. Interestingly, in 2001 there were two more motor vehicle accident deaths than in the previous year despite the decrease in accidental deaths overall. The number of teen motor vehicle accidents is alarming. Lack of driving experience, poor judgement, alcohol/drug use and distractions due to friends in the vehicle all contributed significantly to the 61 motor vehicle accidents where teens were driving. In addition, several children, who were born in other countries and later immigrated to Iowa, died in motor vehicle crashes. In every one of these accidents, the driver of the vehicle (teen or parent) either was inexperienced with the harsh weather conditions or unfamiliar with Iowa's seatbelt and child safety restraint laws. These findings present a good case for graduated driver's licenses based on a young driver's age and other factors. Expanding driving privileges as a driver becomes more experienced with inclement weather driving and night driving is advisable to prevent future accidents of the types seen for 2001 road fatalities.  2   Homicide deaths decreased from 20 to 14 deaths between 2000 and 2001. In addition, 5 of the 14 deaths were caused by the same perpetrator who killed a mother and all of her children. As too often is seen, the perpetrator had been the mother's paramour. Undetermined manner deaths are deaths caused by something that cannot be pinpointed from a thorough autopsy, death scene investigation or other means. The majority of these deaths are attributed to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Despite a decrease in child deaths overall, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) deaths diminished by only one death from 2000 to 2001. Iowa's SIDS deaths still exceed that of most other states. Improved compliance by child-care givers (parents, grandparents, child-care providers) regarding proper safe sleep-practices and smoke free environments would greatly reduce the chances that so many of Iowa's children would die from SIDS. Suicides among children 17 and younger increased Even more tragic is the fact that the youngest child Improved gun safety in the home, including locked ammunition, could greatly reduce the number of su deaths were caused by firearms. by 28% from 2000 (18 cases) to 2001 (23 cases). to commit suicide was only nine years of age. gun cabinets and separately locked up icides by children since 12 of the 23 (52.2%)  Team Recommendations For Elected Officials:  Increase the fine to $100 for driving with an improperly restrained child in a motor vehicle.  Expand required autopsies for children from the current birth through age two years to birth through six years.  Increase reimbursement to counties for SIDS autopsies.  Expand the Empowerment initiative to all areas of the state.  Expand appropriated funding for the Iowa Child Death Review Team to cover actual operating expenses ($40,000).  Require immediate drug screens of care providers present when a child dies in a suspected accident, homicide or undetermined manner. Require immediate drug screens of drivers when there is a fatal motor vehicle collision.  Increase the penalty for child endangerment resulting in the death of a child.  Require all in-ground and above ground swimming pools sold in Iowa to have swimming pool alarms installed by the purchaser or seller.  Require all child autopsies to be completed and reported to the State Medical Examiner's office within three months of the death.  Require nicotine metabolite testing to be included in the autopsy when an infant dies so that accurate exposure to tobacco can be determined and evaluated for its role in the death of the child. Many of these recommendations do not require additional money to implement. However, they all require action by elected officials to become policy.  A preventable death is one in which an individual or a community could have reasonably done something that would have changed the circumstances that led to the death. 3   2002 IOWA CHILD DEATH REVIEW TEAM REPORT TO THE GOVERNOR AND IOWA GENERAL ASSEMBLY In 1995, a new state law established the Iowa Child Death Review Team (CDRT). This law (Code of Iowa 135.43) describes the team membership and the specific responsibilities of the CDRT. Additional legislation was passed in 1998 that protects team representatives from liability while performing their duties to the team and protects entities that supply information to the CDRT for review. The Child Death Review Team is composed of 14 members and 7 state government liaisons. Each member represents a different profession or medical specialty, but all of the organizations represented have a documented commitment to helping children survive and thrive. There is a member representing each of the following: perinatology, pediatrics, law enforcement, social work, mental health, substance abuse, domestic violence, family practice, state medical examiner, county attorneys, SIDS, insurance industry, emergency room nurse and a member-at-large. Liaisons from the following state agencies also participate in review of child death cases: human services, public health, transportation, attorney general's office, education, vital records and public safety. These representatives are selected by their agency director with consideration of their expertise in child behavior, injury and death and their commitment to team attendance and interdepartmental cooperation. The Iowa Department of Public Health provides coordination and administrative support for the Child Death Review Team. The teams' responsibilities include:  Collection, review and analyses of child death certificates, data and records concerning the deaths of children ages birth through 17 years, and preparation of an annual report summarizing the team's findings.         Formulation of recommendations to the governor and general assembly about interventions that could prevent future child deaths. Formulation of recommendations to state agencies represented on the CDRT as to how they may improve services to children to prevent future child deaths. Maintenance of confidentiality of all records that the team reviews. Development of protocols and a child abuse-related death committee.  The law also specifies the length of team appointment and attendance requirements for the CDRT members. The rules governing the team's operation may be found in the Iowa Administrative Code 641-90(135). It should be noted that the 1995 legislation mandated reviews of child deaths through age 6 years. In 2000, that age was expanded to include child deaths through age 17 years. Since 1995, the Child Death Review Team has reviewed more than 2400 cases of child death. This document is the seventh CDRT annual report regarding child death in the state of Iowa and ways that future child deaths might be reduced or prevented.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PREVENTION OF FUTURE DEATHS The Child Death Review Team has reviewed cases of child deaths for seven years. The recommendations made in this report are intended to help prevent future deaths. These recommendations are not case-specific, but are intended to deal with a broad range of issues. After a list of the specific recommendations, there is a brief discussion as to why each recommendation was made. Special attention should be given to any recommendation that has been made in previous annual reports and is stated again this year.  4   RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE GOVERNOR AND THE IOWA GENERAL ASSEMBLY RECOMMENDATIONS REQUIRING LEGISLATIVE ACTION: Recommendation 1: The CDRT recommends continued expansion of the Community Empowerment initiative. The CDRT especially advocates implementation of Community Empowerment programs that devote approximately 60% of their funds to home visits for all families with a newborn child so that each family may become educated in appropriate health and care practices relating to infants and young children. Recommendation 2: The CDRT recommends raising the fine to $100 for driving with an improperly restrained child under six years of age in a motor vehicle. Recommendation 3: The CDRT recommends that the performance of an autopsy including toxicology studies be required for every death of a child through age 6 with the exception of children who are known to have died of a disease process while attended by a physician. In addition, the team recommends full body x-rays of any child who dies before their second birthday. Recommendation 4: The CDRT recommends reimbursement for actual expenses incurred for the performance of an autopsy, x-rays and toxicology tests on an infant dying from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome to any county in which a SIDS death occurs. The current law allots $400 per case. The limit for this reimbursement should be $1700. In addition, the CDRT recommends payment of up to a $600 reimbursement for transportation of the body to the autopsy site. 5  Recommendation 5: Immediate drug screens should be done on caretakers and people having access to a child just prior to the death. All drivers involved in a fatal motor vehicle accident should be tested for alcohol and drugs at the time of the crash. Recommendation 6: Funding appropriated for continued operation of the Iowa Child Death Review Team should be raised from $15,000 to $40, 000, so that the actual expenses incurred in operation of team activities may be covered in full. Recommendation 7: The penalty for child endangerment that results in the death of a child should be increased. Section 726.6 of the Iowa Code should be amended to add a NEW subsection 726.6(2), as follows: ""A person who commits child endangerment resulting in the death of a child or minor is guilty of a class ""B"" felony."" Section 902.12 of the Iowa Code should be amended to add a NEW subsection 902.12(5), as follows: ""Child endangerment resulting in serious injury and child endangerment resulting in death in violation of section 726.6(2) or 726.6(3)."" Recommendation 8: The CDRT recommends that all in-ground and above ground swimming pools sold in Iowa be required by law to have a pool alarm installed by the seller or the purchaser. OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS: Recommendation 9: The CDRT recommends the performance of cotinine (a metabolite of nicotine) testing on all infants who die in Iowa to accurately determine the potential role of tobacco exposure as a risk factor in their deaths. It is suggested that funding for this testing should come from state taxes on tobacco products.   Recommendation 10: The CDRT recommends establishment of a statewide system of local or regional child death review teams to review deaths of all children through age 17 occurring in their area. They would share their information with the state team. These teams should be permitted the same statutory authority given to the state CDRT to gather and review information related to child deaths as long as they operate under strict confidentiality guidelines. Team members would be volunteers, so the cost of operating local teams would be minimal. Recommendation 11: The CDRT recommends that every child death that is a medical examiner's case be reported on a Medical Examiner I report form to the State Medical Examiner's office within four weeks of its occurrence. The final autopsy and toxicology results should be submitted within three months of the child's death unless special laboratory tests delay this process. It is recommended that all results be submitted within six months of the child's death.  Therefore, programs such as the Empowerment initiative are of tremendous value in educating new parents and preparing them to provide appropriate and adequate care for their children. Recommendation 2: All too frequently children are not properly restrained in a moving automobile, SUV or truck. In a motor vehicle collision, an unrestrained or inadequately restrained child can be ejected from the vehicle or thrown around in the vehicle. Fatal head injuries and internal injuries often result in these instances. Therefore, anything that may help deter drivers from failing to follow the law that requires children under age 6 to be restrained in a moving vehicle, should be done. A significant fine of $100 would help to obtain compliance. Recommendation 3: An immediate autopsy of a young child who dies helps to accurately pinpoint the precise cause and manner of death. Accurately classifying manner and cause assures that any wrongdoing may be adequately and quickly investigated. It also helps to determine preventable factors that led to the death. Recommendation 4: The state currently reimburses counties $400 for any autopsy done on an infant who dies from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. The actual costs for this type of an autopsy exceeds $1500 when required x-rays and toxicology tests are included. This poor reimbursement places a burden on any county where a SIDS infant dies. In addition, no reimbursement is made for transporting the body to another city or county where a deputy state medical examiner has agreed to perform the autopsy. Increased reimbursement would ease the burden of counties adhering to guidelines for autopsies on infants. It would also encourage transporting bodies to the state medical examiner for autopsy rather than sending them out-of-state to a closer facility.  DISCUSSION OF RECOMMENDATIONS: The following text offers background that supports and explains each recommendation. Recommendation 1: The majority of child deaths resulting from accidents and many resulting from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) could be prevented. Lack of adequate knowledge about child rearing and health, sometimes coupled with lack of parental supervision, plays a huge role in these types of deaths. For example, parents may be unaware of the dangers of even a small amount of bathtub water and the danger it poses to a toddler. Rural families often do not think about the dangers offered by farm ponds, large machinery or building materials. Many parents are unaware that prone sleep position or smoking during pregnancy or afterward contributes to SIDS.  6   Recommendation 5: Alcohol and drugs may play a large part in child neglect, inappropriate child-care, child abuse or in motor vehicle mishaps. It is impossible to assess the involvement of chemical substances in the death of a child if testing for these substances is not done immediately at the death scene on all care providers present when the child dies. Deaths may be inaccurately classified as to cause; perpetrators may go unidentified or unpunished; the extent of the involvement of chemical substances in child deaths may be under-reported and so not addressed by public health programs or legislative action. A law requiring this testing would assure that law enforcement in all parts of the state adhere to this recommendation. Recommendation 6: In 1995 when the Child Death Review Team was established by the legislature and governor, an appropriation of $20,000 was set aside for the team's operation. This funding was to cover team members' travel, report requests, copying of records, development and printing of an annual report, staff support and any other related expenses necessary for the optimal functioning of the CDRT. In 1998, the legislature and governor established the Domestic Violence Death Review Team. The CDRT had the same tasks as when it was originally founded, but $5,000 of the original $20,000 appropriation was set aside for the new Domestic Violence Death Review Team! In 2000, the purview of the CDRT expanded from children birth through age 6 to birth through age 17. The appropriation still remained at $15,000. This funding does not cover much more than team travel, the annual report development, case ordering and some printing. Funding for staff salary, office expenses, team training, etc. is not adequate. Although the FY 2002 budget recommendation originally included a significant increase in the appropriation for the CDRT, it was not funded at that level. Currently, the Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH) is providing additional funds 7  to continue the very basic operation of the CDRT. IDPH obviously understands and appreciates the value of the team. However, it is unrealistic and unfair to expect IDPH to eke out additional funds from its already meager budget to fund an interdisciplinary team that was established by law. Since the 14 professionals on the team donate an average of 12 hours per month to the perform the work of the CDRT, it appears that funding the team at $40,000 per year through an adequate budget appropriation is a small investment for saving the lives of Iowa's children. Recommendation 7: When children die from non-accidental, intentionally inflicted injuries, a perpetrator may presently be charged with either child endangerment resulting in serious injury, a class ""C"" felony punishable by 10 years in prison, or with murder in the first degree, a class ""A"" felony punishable by life in prison without parole. In instances where the available evidence does not support a first degree murder charge (""extreme indifference to human life""), the child endangerment resulting in serious injury is seen an insufficiently serious charge for those acts of child endangerment that result in a child's death. Recommendation 8: The CDRT has reviewed numerous deaths of children who drowned in residential swimming pools. All of these deaths were preventable, had someone known that a child had entered the water. Despite Consumer Product Safety Commission recommendations to the public about putting a fence with a locked gate around any home pool, owners continue to leave pools open and accessible to curious children. A new pool alarm has been developed that can be installed at the water line, inside of the pool. If anyone goes into the pool when the alarm is set, a warning signal sounds to alert the owner and others residing in the area that someone has entered the water. The cost of this type of alarm is approximately $250, a cost that is negligible compared to the cost of a pool.   Recommendation 9: Medical research long ago identified the role of secondhand tobacco exposure in the deaths of infants, primarily from prematurity and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Smoking during pregnancy has been shown to be a major risk factor for both premature birth and SIDS. When prone sleeping position is removed as a risk factor for SIDS, smoking emerges as the next most significant risk. Although birth certificates have a place to record the use of tobacco by the mother during pregnancy, this information may not be recorded or may be inaccurate due to the mother's unwillingness to admit to a behavior that could be harmful to her unborn child. Exposure of an infant to secondhand smoke either at home or at a child care provider's residence may be noted on an Infant Death Scene Investigation, if one is done, but this information has usually been sketchy. We truly do not have an accurate idea of how many infant deaths in Iowa may be related to smoking. The number is probably much greater than birth certificates and death scene investigations indicate. If cotinine testing were done on all infants who die in Iowa, a true grasp of the extent of tobacco exposure in-utero and after birth could be assessed. Then, the need for better smoking-related interventions would be documented in Iowa's population. Recommendation 10: The CDRT conducts retrospective reviews of child deaths so that all records related to the child, such as autopsies and law enforcement investigations, are complete prior to the reviews. The drawback to this method is that if some part of the death investigation was not adequately completed or if questionable information exists on reports, it is most likely too late to obtain that information. In addition, with a retrospective review system, follow-up checks on the safety of surviving siblings, the involvement of vital community agencies in the investigation or public education endeavors are delayed. 8  Several states, notably North Carolina, Colorado and Missouri have developed statewide systems of county multidisciplinary child death review teams. These teams meet immediately following the death of a child to pool their information, determine what else needs to be done, conduct public education activities for prevention of future child deaths and send reports of their reviews to the state child death review team. Communication and sharing of records expedites the review process at all levels and helps assure complete and thorough review of each death by two competent panels of reviewers, one at the local level and one at the state level. Only five Iowa counties (Polk, Woodbury, Dubuque, Pottawattamie and Scott) currently have local review teams. Most of these teams review only infant deaths or child abuse-related deaths. With the expansion of the state's CDRT to include children through age 17 years, it would be helpful to have all local teams include children of the same ages. As with the state team, these 5 local teams try to use what is learned in reviews to prevent future deaths. Establishing a statewide system of local or regional teams would assure earlier, more thorough and targeted interventions on a community level when any child dies. Recommendation 11: Although efficient reporting of out-of-hospital deaths and other medical examiner cases is requested from county medical examiners, current reporting can take months or longer to be reported on an M.E. I form to the State Medical Examiner's office. This delay in reporting causes inaccurate statistical reporting to other agencies and delays the collection of autopsies and other reports for CDRT review. Requiring more efficient completion of reports to the state medical examiner's office would assist the team in its operation and assure complete reporting of all deaths to that office.   RECOMMENDATIONS TO STATE AGENCIES Recommendation 1: to the Iowa Department of Human Services, Field Office Support Unit. When a child dies due to a parent's or a caretaker's ignorance, neglect or aggression, the CDRT recommends that ongoing efforts be made to visit the surviving children in the home within one month to assess the safety and well-being of these children and enable voluntary referrals to appropriate services. This visit is to be completed by DHS caseworkers knowledgeable in family dynamics and child abuse and/or neglect. (It is recognized that the Iowa Department of Human Services has made much progress in addressing this issue. The assessment approach is now being used statewide to respond to reports of child abuse. This approach mandates evaluating the alleged abuse, taking needed actions to safeguard the child and engaging the family in services to enhance family strengths and address identified needs. This approach facilitates the provision of needed services to children and families. In addition, it is recognized that DHS staff cannot investigate situations of which they are not notified. Delayed autopsy results and delayed caretaker drug testing results, along with inconclusive or nonexistent law enforcement investigations, hamper the ability of DHS to intervene with surviving children when abuse may have been involved in the death of a sibling. ) Recommendation 2: to the Commission of Uniform State Laws. The CDRT recommends that the Commission on Uniform State Laws propose legislation in Iowa and promote the passage of legislation in other states which would facilitate the exchange of medical, investigative or other information pertaining to a child death. This legislation should include the following language: "" A person in possession or control of medical, investigative or other information pertaining to a child death and child abuse review shall allow the  reproduction of the information by the Child Death Review Team of another state operating substantially in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, to be used only in the administration and for the duties of that Child Death Review Team and provided that state grants reciprocal exchange of such child death information to Iowa's Child Death Review Team. Information and records that are otherwise confidential remain confidential under this section. A person does not incur legal liability by reason of releasing information to a Child Death Review Team as required under this section."" A meeting between Iowa's CDRT and representatives from other Child Death Review Teams was held in Des Moines in April 2000. One of the main objectives of that conference was to discuss better sharing of information among states. All state team representatives agreed that they also have problems collecting information from other states, and they would support an interstate agreement that would expedite and ease the process. Recommendation 3: to the Iowa Department of Human Services. The CDRT recommends that all foster care parents be required to learn and be certified in child and infant CPR and that they be required to be re-certified in this procedure annually. In addition, foster parents should be required to have extensive education regarding appropriate sleep practices and environment for infants. Their homes should be assessed for secondhand smoke exposure and safety before they are accepted into the foster care program. Recommendation 4: to the Department of Public Safety. The CDRT recommends follow up by law enforcement officers of all cases involving potentially life-threatening injuries resulting from any accident for all children of any age. In the event that an injured child dies either in-state or out-ofstate from an injury that occurred in their jurisdiction, a thorough investigation of the circumstances surrounding the accident should be conducted by law enforcement. 9   Recommendation 5: to the Iowa Department of Public Health. The CDRT recommends enhanced statewide education of parents and other care providers and health care professionals who regularly come in contact with new parents. This education should focus on all risk factors related to an infant's sleep environment and on issues related to tobacco exposure before and after birth. Recommendation 6: to all state agencies and their local units or contractors who conduct activities in the homes of their clients/ customers. The CDRT recommends that the state agencies require each local unit or contractor, whenever conducting activities in the homes of their clients or customers, to check for the presence and operating status of smoke alarms. They should also evaluate the presence of other safety hazards and recommend to residents when repairs, changes or replacements are needed. Recommendation 7: to the Iowa Department of Public Safety and the Iowa Law Enforcement Academy. The CDRT recommends that all law enforcement agencies follow the Child Death Scene Investigation Protocol and that the report forms be filled out and submitted as quickly as possible to the proper entity. It is further recommended that the curriculum of the Iowa Law Enforcement Academy include instruction on this protocol and report form. Recommendation 8: to the Iowa Law Enforcement Academy. The Child Death Review Team recommends that the Iowa Law Enforcement Academy curriculum emphasize the importance of death scene photographs and sketches along with use of the Death Scene Investigation Protocol and Form. Recommendation 9: to the Iowa Department of Human Services. The Child Death Review Team recommends long term close monitoring of children after they have been returned to their parental home or after a parent who has been  incarcerated returns to the home. Special attention should be given to substance abuse by the parent(s) and unsafe surroundings in the child's home. Multidisciplinary team staffings and contacts with the parent's probation officer are suggested for these types of cases. Recommendation 10: to the Iowa Department of Human Services. The Child Death Review Team recommends removal of very young children (less than 4 years old) from unsafe family situations while the parents work to improve the home environment. Close follow up with the family to monitor its progress should be made for one year after the child is back in the home, and frequent and thorough visits to the home should be made. In addition, any caseworker entering a home for any reason should perform a home safety check. The results should be reviewed with the parents, and the safety check should be repeated at a later date to evaluate improvements. Recommendation 11: to the Iowa Department of Public Health. The Child Death Review Team recommends increased education for parents on the hazards of delayed medical care, secondhand smoke exposure, inappropriate dosing of medications and drug interactions. It further recommends enlisting the cooperation of hospitals to include this education for new parents both verbally and through printed information in their discharge-packets.  10   Child Death Review Team Accomplishments During the 2002 calendar year, the members of the Child Death Review Team took a very serious and proactive approach to help save Iowa's children from early deaths. These accomplishments focused primarily on education, meetings and awareness building activities around the state. Specifically, in addition to reviewing 432 cases of child death, the members of the CDRT:  Met with members of the Iowa Legislature to discuss ways to implement some of the recommendations detailed in the 2001 CDRT Annual Report to the Governor and General Assembly. Advanced awareness among health professionals and the public by giving presentations about child abuse. Participated as members of local child death review teams in their county of residence. Worked with the state medical examiner to widely disseminate the newly revised Child Death Scene Investigation Form to law enforcement personnel and county medical examiners. Worked with the Iowa Department of Public Health and the Iowa SIDS Alliance on their regional SIDS conferences for professionals that were held in several sites across Iowa. Several CDRT members were presenters at those conferences. Worked with the Polk County African American community to explore and address the high rate of black infant mortality in Iowa. Worked with DCI to assure a suspected homicide, that was not investigated by local law enforcement, was investigated and acted upon. Revised the Child Death Review Team data collection form to include variables related to deaths of older children and worked with Information Management at IDPH to develop a statistical reporting system.            11   Iowa Year 2001 Deaths of Children Ages Birth through 17 Years By County of Residence County Adair Adams Allamakee Appanoose Audubon Benton Black Hawk Boone Bremer Buchanan Buena Vista Butler Calhoun Carroll Cass Cedar Cerro Gordo Cherokee Chickasaw Clarke Clay Clayton Clinton Crawford Dallas Davis Decatur Delaware Des Moines Dickinson Dubuque Emmet Fayette Number 0 0 3 1 0 1 20 3 2 1 1 1 2 3 5 4 8 3 2 1 1 4 8 2 8 2 2 5 4 3 11 0 1 County Floyd Franklin Fremont Greene Grundy Guthrie Hamilton Hancock Hardin Harrison Henry Howard Humboldt Ida Iowa Jackson Jasper Jefferson Johnson Jones Keokuk Kossuth Lee Linn Louisa Lucas Lyon Madison Mahaska Marion Marshall Mills Mitchell Number 2 0 1 2 3 2 3 0 1 1 1 2 2 1 0 1 5 1 13 4 5 2 2 29 0 0 4 5 1 2 13 2 1 County Numbe Monona Monroe Montgomery Muscatine O'Brien Osceola Page Palo Alto Plymouth Pocahontas Polk Pottawattamie Poweshiek Ringgold Sac Scott Shelby Sioux Story Tama Taylor Union VanBuren Wapello Warren Washington Wayne Webster Winnebago Winneshiek Woodbury Worth Wright r 1 0 3 3 1 1 4 0 4 1 62 6 0 0 3 26 3 2 9 4 1 5 1 2 7 3 3 0 1 1 30 3 1  Number of Out of State Children Ages Birth through 17 Years Dying in Iowa in 2001 State Nebraska Wisconsin Texas Number 10 1 1 State Missouri Illinois Mexico Number 1 4 1  12   Ages of Children at Death Of the 432 children who died in 2001, the youngest was minutes old, and the oldest child was nearly 18. The three age classifications used in this report are birth through 28 days (neonatal), 29 days through 364 days (post-neonatal) and 1 through 17 years (child).

The race/ethnicity attributed to the child is that listed on the birth certificate for the mother. The majority of deaths occurred among whites, followed by Hispanics. Because Iowa's population is primarily Caucasian, these results are to be expected. However, prevention messages and intervention programs must be careful to target all cultural and ethnic groups across the state in the manner most accessible and useful to each group.

Five manners of death relate to deaths of children:  Natural means the death was the result of some natural process, such as disease, prematurity/immaturity or congenital defect. Most deaths by this manner are considered by the CDRT to be nonpreventable. However, many deaths from prematurity or congenital defects might be prevented through better counseling during preconception and pregnancy, earlier or more consistent prenatal care and smoking cessation. Accidental means the death resulted from some unintentional act. This manner of death is the most effectively reducible through education of all care providers of children to provide a safe environment with adequate supervision. Homicide means the death was caused by a criminal act. The act committed by the perpetrator may not have been intended to cause the child's death. Undetermined means that investigation of the circumstances and examination through autopsy did not clearly identify the way in which the death occurred. In this category, we include deaths attributed to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, since this cause is determined by the absence of other signs rather than by a clearly identified finding. Suicide means that evidence exits that the child intentionally caused his or her own death.  Prior to 2001, the team only dealt with deaths from natural, accidental, undetermined and homicide manners. In addition to these five manners of death, when the manner and cause have not yet been determined and the investigation is still incomplete, ""pending"" is recorded as the manner of death. When the final determination has been made, the medical examiner amends the death certificate to accurately indicate the manner and cause of death. For 2001, there were no children for whom an amended death certificate was not submitted to Iowa's Department of Vital Records because of diligent efforts by their staff to obtain the updated information.    Manner of Death For All Child Deaths 2001 Manner Natural Accident Homicide Suicide Undetermined Total Number 262 84 14 23 49 432 % of Deaths 60.7 19.5 3.2 5.3 11.3 100%        15   Causes of Death Death certificates identify the immediate cause of death and, where it can be determined, one or more conditions leading to the immediate cause (i.e., the immediate cause of death was due to or a consequence of some other disease or condition). Because the immediate cause in most instances is cardiac and/or respiratory arrest, we have followed the usual death analysis procedure of using the underlying cause (the disease or injury that initiated events resulting in the death) for our data and analyses. When the team reclassified the manner or cause of death, analyses are based upon manner and cause of death as determined by the CDRT through case reviews. Note: Case determinations were based on evaluations of all materials available at the time the reviews were conducted. Natural The majority of the 262 deaths in this group were due to five causes: prematurity; congenital defects that were incompatible with life or following treatment to correct the defect; birth complications; infections; and, forms of cancer. As demonstrated in the following table, the predominant two causes of natural deaths were prematurity and congenital defects. The 262 natural deaths comprised 60.7 percent of all 2001 child deaths. Deaths from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), although coded as natural on death certificates, are considered separately in this report as part of the undetermined category.

Accidents comprised 19.5 percent of all child deaths occurring that year. The major cause was motor vehicle collisions (72.5% of accidental deaths). Accidental trauma is considered preventable, but to prevent it requires the efforts of many  16   people including the victim, the family and the community. Education of the community, parents and care providers can help prevent accidental deaths among children of all ages. The CDRT believes that better adult supervision could have prevented many of these deaths. Parents and other caregivers need to know where young children are at all times. Adults should remove all dangerous objects from the child's environment and make children use protective gear when they are taking part in potentially dangerous activities. Adults who care for young children should adhere to safe bedding guidelines set forth by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Consumer Product Safety Commission. They should watch for drug and alcohol use among teens that drive and stress bike, motorcycle and automobile safety, including proper use of seat belts and child restraint systems. All parents and other caregivers should make sure fire alarms are in operational order at all times. Fences with locked gates and pool alarms should be used to protect children from wandering into yards with unattended swimming pools. Firearms should be locked away from children and ammunition kept in separate, locked areas. Children under 12 should not be allowed to operate any motor vehicle including snowmobiles, all terrain vehicles or go-carts. There were no accidents among neonates. For post-neonatal deaths, there were three deaths due to accidents: one house-fire, one motor vehicle accident and one case of hyperthermia. All other accidents involved children one year or older.

The perpetrator's relationship to the victim varied. In one case, the father was the perpetrator. The mother was responsible in three deaths. The mother's paramour was guilty in eight cases. A friend killed one teen male, and for one death the perpetrator was never identified. Homicides are another area where prevention is possible. When a young child is the victim, this type of death often indicates anger and frustration on the part of the caregiver. Parents and caregivers need easily accessible outlets, i.e. respite care or someone to call, when stresses of child-care escalate. Improved dissemination of information to all new parents about 17   resources could assist in preventing future child homicide deaths. Home visits soon after an infant's birth to families that are at high risk for abusing children is needed in every community. Early intervention could save lives. Older children must not have easy access to firearms. All children should be closely supervised to make sure their social contacts are appropriate and interactions take place under safe circumstances. Parents should monitor teens for alcohol and drug use. Parents must be conscientious and discriminating about the adults they bring into close and unsupervised contact with their children no matter what the role of the outsider in the household. Communities must work together to stem the use of drugs and alcohol and eliminate the existence of domestic violence and gang activities.

Undetermined Undetermined manner of deaths includes any death that cannot be classified as natural, accident, suicide or homicide. Most of the deaths included in this manner are ruled Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). It is specified as the cause of death when all other causes have been eliminated based on a thorough autopsy, death scene investigation and clinical history. Although SIDS deaths are recorded on the death certificate as natural, the CDRT considers all SIDS deaths to be undetermined manner of death based on the technical definition of SIDS. The team determined that there were 49 child deaths for which autopsies failed to pinpoint a specific cause of death. The cause of death in the majority (37) of these deaths was found to be SIDS. The remaining 12 deaths were due to a variety of other causes, none of which could be clearly identified.  2 1 6 1 3 1 14  14.3 7.1 42.9 7.1 21.4 7.1 100%  18   Causes of Undetermined Deaths All Children through 17 Years of Age Cause SIDS Undetermined Total Number 37 12 49 % of Undetermined 75.5 24.5 100% % of All deaths 8.6 2.7 11.3  SIDS Deaths by Month Month January February March April May June July August September October November December Total Number of Deaths 6 4 4 1 3 1 3 1 6 4 2 2 37  SIDS Deaths Most SIDS deaths occur in infants 2 to 4 months of age.

Bed sharing is becoming an enormous risk. In 2001, 15 (40.5%) of the infants dying from SIDS were sleeping with at least one adult or with a sibling on an adult bed, sofa or adult bed mattress. Prenatal Smoking by Mother for Infants Who Died of SIDS Smoking Yes No Unknown Total Number 16 19 2 37 % of SIDS 43.2 51.4 5.4 100%  The majority of 2001 SIDS deaths occurred while a parent was caring for the infant, and most occurred during January, September and March. SIDS deaths usually occur during colder months.  19   Secondhand Smoke Exposure by Infants Who Died of SIDS Exposure Yes No Unknown Total Number 25 4 8 37 % of SIDS 67.6 10.8 21.6 100%  Nearly half of the mothers of SIDS babies smoked during pregnancy. Since smoking is self-reported on birth certificates, it is likely that the actual number is much greater. Alarmingly, 67.6% of SIDS infants were routinely exposed to second hand smoke from at least one source after birth. Bedding at Time of Death for Infants Who Died of SIDS Bedding Inappropriate Appropriate Unknown Total Number 16 14 7 37 % of SIDS 43.3 37.8 18.9 100%  Clearly, most of the infants dying in 2001 from SIDS were exposed to risks in their sleep environment. More than 43% were exposed to unsafe bedding, and 51.4% were found in a prone position. Another 10.8% were found on their side. Literature indicates that prone position carries nine times the risk of back position, while side carries two times the risk of back sleeping. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in bed-sharing which puts infants at risk, not just from possible overlaying by a parent or sibling, but from heavy, porous bed covers and pillows on an adult sleep surface and from overheating when exposed to adult body heat. Breast-feeding is very beneficial for infants and is strongly advocated by the CDRT. However, many breast-feeding experts promote bed sharing to ease access for the infant. The hazards of the adult bed should preclude such advice as the statistics suggest. In 2001, 40.5% of babies succumbing to SIDS were sharing a sleep surface with an adult or older sibling.

In 2001, the total number of births in Iowa was 37,610. Iowa's SIDS occurrence rates for the past nine years are as follows:          1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001         1.43 deaths per 1000 live births 1.37 deaths per 1000 live births 1.22 deaths per 1000 live births .73 deaths per 1000 live births .82 deaths per 1000 live births .86 deaths per 1000 live births 1.28 deaths per 1000 live births .99 deaths per 1000 live births .98 deaths per 1000 live births  The Iowa Department of Public Health and the Iowa SIDS Alliance offered many educational seminars on SIDS to Iowans during 2002. New SIDS brochures that note the risks of bed-sharing and a new SIDS educational video were developed and sent to all pediatric and family practice clinics throughout Iowa, as well as to all hospitals with OB departments. In addition, updated SIDS educational brochures for child-care providers were developed. Educating the teachers of parents, grandparents, child-care providers and others who come in contact with infants is the key to reducing risks for Iowa's babies and saving lives from SIDS. Suicide Suicide is a manner of death not previously reviewed by the members of the Iowa Child Death Review Team. As the team expanded its purview to include children ages 7 through 17 years of age, suicide deaths became a primary area where lives could potentially be saved. To improve the team's knowledge about suicide, a child psychiatrist was added to the team when the original mental health representative resigned. In 2001, suicides comprised 5.3% of all child deaths. In any given year, more males than females successfully commit suicide. Males are more likely to use a violent means of death. The victim may be involved with drugs or alcohol abuse, may have unhealthy social contacts, family problems, be physically or sexually abused or have a history of mental health problems. Unfortunately, 23 youth died from suicide in the year 2001. This number is a 28% increase over child suicide deaths in 2000. Of the 23 suicides of children, 21 were males. The youngest victim was only nine years old, and the oldest child was nearly 18. Several victims had a history of family or school problems, and some had used  For comparison, based on preliminary data for 2000 the national SIDS mortality rate was .529 per 1000 live births. When Iowa's SIDS deaths increased by 50% (from 32 to 48) from 1998 to 1999, the Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH), the Iowa Child Death Review Team, and the Iowa SIDS Alliance joined forces to take aggressive measures to halt the increase. In January 2001, IDPH and the Iowa SIDS Alliance sent a letter to all hospital administrators in the state. The 1999 SIDS statistics and SIDS educational materials were enclosed. Hospitals were asked to help stem the rise in SIDS deaths by modeling appropriate sleep position of healthy infants in their newborn nurseries. Most of the hospitals re-evaluated and revised their policies for sleep position. As the health ""experts"" that come most closely into contact with the mother for a prolonged period of time directly following a baby's birth, their example is most likely to be mimicked at home. Unfortunately, some Iowa hospitals still resist back sleeping in the nursery for healthy newborns, usually because the staff adheres to old beliefs that infants placed on their backs soon after birth will choke if they spit up. This has not shown to be the case, but changing attitudes is a slow process.  21   drugs and/or alcohol. Most of the deaths occurred in rural counties. Self-inflicted gunshot wounds were the primary method used by males, followed by hanging. The two females used hanging to end their young lives.

Actions and Strategies that Could Prevent Future Deaths of Natural Manner 1. Both prospective parents (father and mother) should be physically mature and healthy, both prior to conception of the child and throughout the pregnancy. Damaging substances of any sort, including alcohol, tobacco, certain prescription medications and all street drugs must be avoided. 2. Prenatal care should begin as early as possible, and regular prenatal visits should be continued. Prenatal visits should include intensive smoking cessation counseling if the mother currently smokes. In addition, evaluation of secondhand smoke exposure of the mother should be conducted early on in the pregnancy, and the potential risks of such exposure should be carefully explained to her. 3. Prenatal visits should include patient-specific education and interventions aimed at modifiable risk factors such as tobacco, alcohol and drug use. 4. Genetic counseling, available through the University of Iowa regional clinics or private sources, should be recommended to and utilized by parents with potential genetic problems, especially to those who have given birth to children with genetic anomalies, to identify and make the parents aware of the possibilities of future problems. 5. All children should receive regular and timely wellness checkups at clinics or physicians' offices. Parents should be educated about signs and symptoms of illness in their children and indications for seeking medical attention. Families should be discouraged in using hospital emergency rooms as their only source of medical care, since preventive activities such as immunizations may be missed at the time of care. 6.New parents should be thoroughly instructed on the appropriateness and timeliness of well child checkups and proper administration medicines to young children. 7. Iowa's hard to reach populations, such as certain cultural and ethnic communities, should have culturally-targeted education on the necessity for quality and timely prenatal care, potential hazards of home births and preventive care and practices relating to young children. This education should be done in the language most used by each population. 8. Hospitals should evaluate the mental stability and intellectual capacity of mothers prior to discharge after a new baby is born. Referrals to social services, DHS or local Empowerment should be made if there are concerns about a mother's ability to parent.  23   Actions and Strategies that Could Prevent Future Accidental Deaths  1. Children six and under should always be properly restrained when riding in motor vehicles of any type. Care should be taken that the child restraint device being used is of the correct type (i.e. infant-seat or booster-seat) and has been properly fitted to the child. The device should also be installed properly, and the child must be correctly positioned and fastened in the restraint system. 2. Children should ride in the rear seats of vehicles and child safety door locks should be used when available. Automobiles should be kept locked when not in use. 3. Individuals who have repeatedly demonstrated unsafe driving should not be permitted to continue driving. Stronger penalties for multiple offense drivers should be instituted. 4. Bicycle helmet use should be required by law, and the requirement should be strongly supported by parents, teachers and caregivers. 5. Parents and other drivers should check behind all motor vehicles, including farm equipment, before backing up any vehicle. 6. Parents, grandparents, foster parents, daycare providers and other caregivers should learn first aid, administration of CPR, and the Heimlich Maneuver to infants and children. 7. Parents and caregivers should recognize and give only ageappropriate foods to infants and children with special attention to solids given before the age of four. 8. Extreme vigilance should be practiced whenever children are in, around, or near water, including bathtubs, pools and larger bodies of water regardless of the water depth. Parents and caregivers need to be cautioned that bathtub rings are not safety devices and that children must never be left alone in the water, even momentarily. Children playing near lakes, ponds and rivers should use flotation devices as a precaution. In addition, children should be taught to swim as early as possible. 9. Home gates. To should be should be pools should be surrounded by fencing and have locked prevent unsupervised play by curious children, wading pools emptied immediately after each use. Likewise, fencing put around decorative ponds in residential areas.  10. Smoke alarms should be installed in every house, apartment and trailer home and checked frequently to assure their continuing operability. 11. Children less than twelve years of age should never operate an All Terrain Vehicle. Young children should not ride on All Terrain Vehicles. 24   12. A responsible person should supervise children at play, especially if potentially dangerous equipment or hazardous apparatus is in or near the play area. This supervision is especially important in areas where open septic tanks, manure pits or grain bins may be accessible to the children. 13. Firearms should be stored unloaded and in a locked receptacle, and ammunition should be stored in a separate, locked receptacle, with both keys unavailable to children. 14. Children should not ride on farm equipment unless it is in a closed cab that has securely fastened doors, and they are under the direct supervision of an adult. 15. Matches and lighters should be stored only in safe places that are unknown to young children. Parents should teach all children about the dangers of matches and lighters. 16. Children should be well supervised by a competent adult at all times. The adult should be capable of and attuned to evaluating potential dangers in the child's environment and continually monitoring their surroundings for possible hazards. 17. Infants and young children should sleep only in a safety-approved crib and alone. Cribs should not be purchased at garage sales or second-hand stores where they may not meet CPSC requirements. 1. Mothers should be cautioned about careful selection of individuals who care for their children, most especially paramours. Reports of criminal history can be obtained at reasonable charge from local police departments. 2. Inexperienced parents should be linked with a mentor to whom they can turn when they have questions or are stressed. 3. The frequency and content of public service announcements that illustrate the importance of parents or other caretakers taking a ""time out"" when the stress of child care becomes overwhelming should be improved. 4. Parents should be given a list of respite care resources/options and emergency numbers at the time of hospital discharge after the birth of every new infant. These resources should also be discussed at prenatal visits. 5. Parents of older children should carefully and consistently monitor the friends with whom they associate and enforce strict curfews.  Actions and Strategies that Could Prevent Future Homicide Deaths  25   Actions and Strategies that Could Prevent Future SIDS and Other Undetermined Deaths  1. Media efforts to promote back sleeping should be stepped up. Easy to read and understandable SIDS informational brochures and other educational materials should be widely distributed on a continual basis across the state to physician offices, public health nurses, public agencies, child care providers, hospital OB departments and other groups who deal directly with infants and their families. 2. Every baby should have its own sleeping place and should not share a sleeping place with parents, whether a potential shared place is a bed, a couch, a chair or the floor. 3. Cribs, bassinets, and other sleeping places should be checked for firmness of mattress and absence of potential causes of smothering, choking or re-breathing, such as pillows, adult blankets, wide spaces between mattress and sides, crib bumper pads, stuffed toys and small items. Sofas, adult beds or chairs, recliners and waterbeds should never be used as an infant bed or sleep surface. 4. Pregnant women, mothers, fathers and other caregivers should be counseled about smoking hazards to children, both before and after their birth. 5. Pregnant women should be counseled as to the potential negative effects on their offspring of illicit drug use and alcohol use during pregnancy. 6. Parents, grandparents and other care providers to neonates and infants should be educated about appropriate sleep position and sleep environment. 7. Physicians should repeatedly counsel pregnant females and parents of very young children about SIDS risk factors, especially if the mother is very young herself, either parent smokes, or the mother is not seeking consistent prenatal care. 8. Special efforts to educate non-English speaking pregnant women and their families about SIDS risk factor should be implemented. 9. Parents should be educated on selection of an appropriate daycare provider who is aware of and follows the ""Back to Sleep"" recommendations, and who provides a smoke-free home in which to care for children.  26   Child Death Review Team Members and the disciplines they represent  Valarie Campbell, MD SIDS Coalition  Jan Mackey Social Worker  Joseph Cowley, PhD Substance Abuse Counselors  Melissa Sally Mueller Emergency Medical Services  Lois Fingerman Domestic Violence  Christine O'Connell Corken County Attorneys  Julia Goodin, MD State Medical Examiner's Office  Kevin Took, MD Mental Health  Barbara Harre, MD Pediatrics  Lon Walker, Chair Law Enforcement  Herman Hein, MD Neonatology  Mona Walters Emergency Room Nurse  Gerald Loos, MD, Vice-chair Family Practice  Robert Wortman Insurance Industry  STATE GOVERNMENT LIAISONS Virginia Barchman Attorney General's Office  Jill France Vital Records, IDPH  Charlotte Burt Department of Education  Dan Moser Department of Public Safety  Scott Falb Department of Transportation  Rosemary Norlin Department of Human Services  Dennis Klein, MD Department of Public Health  Coordinator Stephanie Pettit, PhD Department of Public Health"

The many helpful comments we received from our readers aided us in improving this report, which covers deaths occurring in 1999. In our review process, the team relies on information already gathered by coroners, law enforcement, and medical personnel. The team does not contact the family or friends of children who have died. The team is gratified to know some changes in child health activities have been initiated as a result of our first 2 years of review. In keeping with our objective to identify potential risk factors and preventable causes of death, we hope to be able to provide a basis for changes to reduce child deaths in Idaho. Positive changes that have occurred in Idaho since our last report are:  Graduated Driver's Licensure. You can be licensed in Idaho when you are 15 years old. However, teenagers under 17 years old, must first successfully complete an approved driver's training program. Under Idaho's Graduated Driver's License Program, all drivers must then complete a Supervised Instruction Period (SIP). After completing the SIP, the driver will be eligible to apply for a driver's license. This license will be restricted to driving during daylight hours only until the driver is 16 years old. Daylight hours are defined as from ""1/2 hour before sunrise to 1/2 hour after sunset."" Development of a community-based `System of Care' for children with serious emotional disturbance and their families. The Idaho Council on Children's Mental Health (ICCMH) is leading this effort under the direction of the Lieutenant Governor and through statewide collaboration between the directors of agencies that serve children, advocates and providers of mental health services. Development of a statewide suicide prevention plan. The Suicide Prevention Advocacy Network (SPAN) -Idaho Board of Directors is leading this effort, with support from the Governor's Generation of the Child Initiative, Department of Health and Welfare and other public and private organizations. The purpose of this plan is to coordinate activities related to prevention, survivor support and awareness/education of suicide in Idaho. A pediatric training session for First Responders, EMT's, and Paramedics at each of the 5 Regional Emergency Medical Services conferences. The initial training sessions were pediatric airway or child abuse awareness training.        Challenges that we believe continue to hinder our ability to provide thorough case review and informed recommendations include:  Inability to obtain medical records.  3      Incomplete information on records, such as coroner reports on SIDS deaths, suicides, and other non-motor vehicle accidents. Lack of subpoena power to obtain medical records SUMMARY OF FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  Of 231 deaths in 1999, 128 were presented to the CMRT, and 126 were reviewed:   A review could not be completed on 2 cases presented to the team due to investigations still pending, and incomplete information. Forty-eight (48) Idaho children died in motor vehicle accidents in Idaho in 1999. The team recommends:  A standard (primary) seat belt law that covers all ages and all seating positions.  Child safety restraint education for parents based on National guidelines according to the child's age and size.  Public education on the danger of riding unrestrained in pickup truck beds. The team supports the Department of Education proposed revised rules for minimum course standards for the delivery of teen driver education and training.  Twenty (20) Idaho children died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) in Idaho in 1999. The team is concerned about the lack of information available on SIDS deaths and the ongoing behavior of not placing infants on their backs to sleep. We recommend: The CDC SIDS investigation form be used for all cases of suspected SIDS. The form is available at www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr4510.pdf. An ongoing effort to educate new mothers about the risk factors that can contribute to SIDS, including advice from the American Academy of Pediatrics that parents and caregivers should place healthy infants on their backs to sleep. www.aap.org/family/infsids.htm  4     Twelve (12) Idaho children died due to suicide in Idaho in 1999. The team was challenged by the lack of a consistent investigation of child suicide deaths and the lack of information regarding the medical, social, school, and psychological history of the victim. We recommend professional education addressing the importance of collecting medical histories, performing thorough scene investigations, conducting psychological autopsies, and toxicological exams on victims of suicide.    Seven (7) Idaho children died due to drowning accidents in Idaho in 1999. The team recommends that small children NEVER be left unsupervised around any container of water large enough for the child to get their head in. This includes mop buckets, toilets, bathtubs, pools, spas and open bodies of water such as canals, rivers and reservoirs.    Seventeen (17) child death reviews were hampered by lack of access to complete records and were so incomplete that preventability could not be determined. The team is concerned about the inability to provide a meaningful review of child deaths due to the lack of information available. We recommend a mechanism to assist the review team in obtaining records surrounding the child death. There are multiple options used successfully by other states including:     Granting the team statutory authority to access applicable records. Statutory authority through a State Medical Examiner system to obtain applicable records. Granting the team subpoena power to request applicable records. Laws protecting the team review documents from discoverability.  5   HISTORY  Concern for the welfare of children, particularly those who are abused or neglected, has been longstanding among public and private social service agencies, professionals, and the general public. In response to this concern, Los Angeles County, California started child mortality review in 1978. Their success in identifying preventable child deaths has led to many states instituting statewide child mortality review teams. The overall goals of the teams include focusing on creating effective multi-agency case management and improving prevention and intervention programs to protect children from serious injury and death. In response to this same concern, then-Governor Philip E. Batt, with Executive Order No. 98-10 (Appendix A), formed Idaho's Child Mortality Review Team on July 16, 1998. The team is appointed by the Director of the Department of Health and Welfare and consists of a multidisciplinary, multi-agency board. Bureaus within the Division of Health and the Idaho Transportation Department's Office of Highway Safety provide support to the team. In 22 years, child mortality review teams have become a national standard in the effort to protect children. According to the National Center on Child Fatality Review, as of 2000, multi-agency child death review teams exist in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. CHILD MORTALITY REVIEW TEAM  The Idaho Child Mortality Review Team represents a combination of public, criminal justice, health, and social service organizations. Team members participate in the review and make decisions by voting on the preventability of the death and identification of prevention activities and target audiences. The following members were appointed to the team by the Director of the Department of Health and Welfare and participated in the 1999 reviews: Matthew Brown, MD, Pediatrician, Chair Shirley Alexander, MSW, Child Protection Program Specialist, and Children at Risk Task Force Member D. Lee Binnion, MD, Emergency Physician Robert Cihak, MD, Pathologist Vicki DeGeus-Morris, Coroner, Canyon County Eve Dickinson, Keeping Children Safe Panel Member, Community Representative 6   Kip Manwaring, Prosecuting Attorney, Bonneville County Christine Hahn, MD, State Epidemiologist Julene Parsons, MD, Pediatrician Tony Wallace, Sgt., Boise Police Department ASSISTANTS TO THE CHILD MORTALITY REVIEW TEAM  The Child Mortality Review Team has the support of many state agencies in their efforts to review child deaths. The assistants provide record review and clerical support. They do not have decision making or voting authority on the team. The Epidemiologist and Child Protection Program Specialist from the team meet with the screening group monthly. The following assistants provided support to the team during the 1999 reviews: Dia Gainor, Chief, Emergency Medical Services Bureau Boni Carrell, EMS for Children Planner, Emergency Medical Services Bureau Pam Marcum, Consultant, (former Forensic Scientist, Idaho Department of Law Enforcement) Jo Ann Moore, Manager, Office of Highway Safety Susan Mulkey, IT Production Specialist, Office of Highway Safety Kathy Simplot, Senior Research Analyst, Bureau of Vital Records and Health Statistics Diane Prince, Administrative Assistant, Bureau of Clinical and Preventive Services Members bring a wide variety of experience and perspectives on children's health, safety, and maltreatment issues. Because of the varied expertise the team possesses, the ability to identify prevention and intervention activities is greatly enhanced.  7   MISSION STATEMENT  To reduce preventable child fatalities through systemic, multidisciplinary, multi-agency review of child fatalities; resulting in data-driven recommendations for legislation, public policy, statewide and community-based prevention education, and systems improvement.  OBJECTIVES  The team has developed the following objectives to direct its work:     Identify potentially preventable causes of death. Identify the risk factors leading to the death. Collect and organize the information into meaningful summaries of causes of child death in Idaho. Make specific and feasible recommendations to the Governor and Chairs of the Senate and House Health and Welfare committees on ways in which child mortality can be reduced in Idaho.  8   METHODOLOGY  Deaths of Idaho resident children, less than 18 years of age, dying in Idaho during 1999 were reviewed. Deaths of children dying out of state were not reviewed since records surrounding circumstances of their deaths are unavailable for the team's use. The Bureau of Vital Records and Health Statistics identified the child deaths. An abstract of each death certificate was supplied to the screening group, which met monthly to view the abstracts and identify potentially preventable deaths. The screening group selected a death for further review when it met one or more of the following criteria:    Death was due to an external cause, or Death was unexplained, or Death was due to a cause with identified risk factors.  The death was assessed to identify additional information necessary for a comprehensive review. Additional information was requested from the appropriate agency. The sources of information could include:       Autopsy reports Coroner reports Law enforcement reports Medical records Emergency medical system records Child protection records  Recognizing that the records of child deaths and circumstances leading to the deaths are kept by multiple agencies, the team strives to examine the events leading to death across systems and over time. The team does not have subpoena power and cannot always obtain confidential records. Of 231 deaths in 1999, 126 met the criteria for review and additional information was requested. After available records were collected, the assistants reviewed the information, and the cases were prepared for presentation before the Child Mortality Review Team (CMRT). The team, including the assistants, met quarterly. Available information from records on the child deaths were presented with additional input from the team members and assistants. The 126 deaths selected for review included all accident, suicide, homicide, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, and deaths of undetermined intent. Eleven of the deaths due to natural causes were also reviewed. Deaths that were not sent for further review included most deaths due to extreme prematurity, cancer, and 9   severe multiple congenital anomalies, unless preventive measures could clearly have reduced the risk of infant death (e.g., trauma leading to a premature birth). Detailed technical notes can be found under Appendix B. Only deaths that were judged to be definitely or probably preventable were considered ""preventable"" for the purposes of this document. The teams' working definition for preventability was: Preventability refers to the ability of an individual or community to reasonably have done something to alter the conditions that led to the child's death, thereby preventing the child's death, or reasonably do something now to reduce the likelihood of future deaths. Examples include, but are not limited to, implementing safety rules, laws, or policies; creating or improving barriers around dangerous areas; educating children or adults in the community; or improving access to health care. The preventability of each death was stratified into categories as outlined by identifying documented risk factors which would have likely contributed to the death. Preventable Definitely Probably Probably not Not preventable Unable to determine Definition Definite actions could have been taken to prevent this death. Certain actions may have decreased the likelihood of this death. This death was probably not preventable. No preventive measures were found.  Risk factors, prevention opportunities, and intervention activities were identified. A data collection form was completed on each case reviewed. If additional records were needed, or specific questions were raised that required more information, a case review was continued at the next meeting. If additional information was unobtainable, the case was considered incomplete, and a determination of preventability was not made. Of the 126 cases presented to the CMRT, 17 cases were considered incomplete and preventability could not be determined. The following table identifies the 17 deaths by manner.

This evidence may illuminate, confirm, or in some cases, contradict the conclusion about cause based solely on external review. Autopsies are an important aspect of many death investigations but are not mandated by Idaho State law.

Of the 231 deaths in 1999, 128 were presented to the CMRT and 126 were reviewed. Of the 126 reviewed deaths, 105 were considered to be preventable after team review; 4 were considered not preventable. Seventeen (17) were classified as unable to determine preventability due to lack of sufficient information. Preventable?

Certain actions may have decreased the likelihood of this death. This death was probably not preventable. No preventive measures were found. 103 2 4 0 17  Two deaths presented to the team were not reviewed because investigations were pending. The cases were:   A fall of a 15 year old from a bridge An unexplained cause of death of an infant  21   NATURAL DEATHS  The rate of death from natural causes in children is highest in the first year of life and generally results from such causes as pregnancy complications, congenital anomalies, and SIDS. Natural causes of death quickly become less common as children grow older. Of the 126 deaths reviewed by the team, 11 were identified as natural. Of the 11 natural deaths preventability could not be determined for 4 deaths due to lack of information. There were 3 natural deaths reviewed in which no preventable measures were found. Four (4) of the deaths were determined to be definitely or probably preventable. Two (2) of the 4 preventable deaths are summarized below. A teenager died due to diabetic coma, due to untreated juvenile diabetes. A child born with multiple birth defects from exposure to the prescription drug Accutane (Isotretinoin) during pregnancy died from cardiopulmonary arrest at a young age.  1999 Conclusions and recommendations The team recommends that parents be made aware of the danger of not getting medical treatment for children who have symptoms of illness.  22   SUDDEN INFANT DEATH SYNDROME (SIDS)  SIDS is the leading cause of death in babies from 1 month to 1 year of age. SIDS is defined as the sudden death of an infant less than one year of age which remains unexplained after a thorough case investigation, including performance of a complete autopsy, examination of the death scene, and a review of the clinical history. There were 20 SIDS deaths in Idaho in 1999.  Nationally most SIDS deaths occur when a baby is between 1 and 4 months old. In Idaho in 1999 half (10) of SIDS deaths occurred between 1 and 4 months of age.

The table identifies the race and ethnicity of the SIDS deaths in Idaho in 1999.  Idaho SIDS deaths, 1999 Race White Ethnicity Hispanic Non-Hispanic  Number 20 1 19  According to the CDC, an infant who sleeps on its stomach is more at risk for SIDS. Babies who are not breastfed, who are exposed to tobacco smoke, and who get overheated because of too many clothes also seem to be at increased risk, as are infants whose sleeping surface is too soft and excessively padded. The risk increases when a baby shares a bed with an adult; the risk is greater still if more than one adult is in the bed or if the adult is under the influence of alcohol or drugs. SIDS is not caused by vomiting and choking, or minor illnesses such as colds or infections. In Idaho and the rest of the northwest, SIDS rates have been historically higher than the national average. There has been a significant decline in SIDS rates in the U.S. since 1992 (see page 13). The decline is attributable in part to the recognition that SIDS risks decrease with the placement of infants on their backs for sleep and the CDC's ""Back to Sleep"" campaign. Research shows that having infants sleep on their backs reduces the risk of SIDS by 30-50 percent. In Idaho in 1999 the majority of infants who died from SIDS were found on their stomachs when the position was known. Re porte d position w he n found 10 8 6 4 2 0 Stomac h Bac k Side Unknow n  According to the Idaho Bureau of Vital Records and Health Statistics, ""PRATS: Pregnancy Risk Assessment Tracking System, 1999 Survey"" Idaho resident mothers reported  Nearly two-thirds (62%) put their baby down to sleep on his/her back, most of the time.  Over one-fourth (28.4%) put their baby on his/her side, most of the time.  8.4% reported that they placed their baby on his/her stomach to sleep most of the time.  24   Nine (9) of the 20 SIDS deaths reviewed were thought to be definitely preventable. Many of the 20 SIDS deaths reviewed had modifiable risk factors identified. The risk factors are not exclusive of one another. There can be more than one risk factor identified in each case.  RISK FACTOR Soft bedding Exposure to tobacco smoke Regular sleeping position other than back Co-sleeping with 2 people Co-sleeping with 1 person Infant overheated/overdressed  NUMBER 8 6 3 3 2 0  The ideal sleep surface for infants is firm with no soft items under or near the baby. Thirty percent (6) of the infants dying of SIDS in Idaho in 1999 were in their cribs when they were discovered. The others were found in the following locations:        5 2 2 1 1 1 2 were in beds were on the floor were on sofas in a stroller in a bassinet on a mattress of the records did not state the location of discovery.  Eleven (11) of the SIDS deaths reviewed had insufficient evidence to determine preventability. While the cause of SIDS remains unknown, the risk can be reduced by understanding and being aware of risk factors, but no one behavior can eradicate the risk completely. An infant was breast fed and placed in the crib to sleep. The position the child was placed in to sleep was not documented on any of the available records. The parents checked on the child 6 hours later and found the child not breathing.  Data Gaps For a SIDS diagnosis to be made there has to be a thorough case investigation, including performance of a complete autopsy, examination of the death scene, and review of the clinical history. Most SIDS deaths did not have a SIDS investigation form completed and much information was missing. For example, reports received did not include information on sleep position, maternal smoking, or sleeping surface. The SIDS investigation form is available at www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr4510.pdf  25   1999 Conclusions and recommendations The team is concerned about the lack of information available on SIDS deaths and the ongoing behavior of not placing infants on their backs to sleep. We recommend:  The CDC SIDS investigation form should be used for all cases of suspected SIDS. The SIDS investigation form is available at www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr4510.pdf. An ongoing effort to educate new mothers about the risk factors that can contribute to SIDS, including this advice from the American Academy of Pediatrics web site www.aap.org/family/infsids.htm.    Infant Sleep Positioning and SIDS Parents and caregivers should place healthy infants on their backs when putting them down to sleep. This is because recent studies have shown an increase in Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) in infants who sleep on their stomachs. There is no evidence that sleeping on the back is harmful to healthy infants. Keep the following points in mind       Placing a child to sleep on the back has the lowest risk and is preferred. Sleeping on the side, however, is a reasonable alternative and is safer than sleeping on the stomach. Do not place your infant to sleep on waterbeds, sofas, soft mattresses, or other soft surfaces. Pillows, quilts, comforters, or sheepskins should not be placed under your infant. Soft materials such as pillows, quilts, comforters, sheepskins, or stuffed toys should be kept out of an infant's bed. These items can cover your child's airway even if he is lying on his back. Devices designed to maintain sleep position or to reduce the risk of rebreathing are not recommended since many have not been tested sufficiently for safety. None have been shown to reduce the risk of SIDS. This recommendation is for healthy infants. Some infants with certain medical conditions or malformations may need to be placed on their stomachs to sleep. For these children, talk to your pediatrician about which sleep position is best. This recommendation is for sleeping infants. A certain amount of ""tummy time,"" while the baby is awake and observed, is recommended for developmental reasons and to avoid flat spots on the head.  Additional tips to reduce the risk of SIDS    Do not smoke during pregnancy; continue to provide Make sure your baby does not become overheated. it feels comfortable for an adult, and dress your baby wear. Share all of these important tips for preventing SIDS caregivers. a smoke-free environment for your baby. Keep the temperature in the baby's room so in as much or little clothing as you would with baby-sitters, grandparents, and other  26   UNINTENTIONAL INJURY  Injuries play a greater role in mortality as children grow older. Injuries are the leading cause of death in children from 1-17 years of age. Of the 126 deaths reviewed by the team, injuries claimed the lives of 92 children; the majority (73) of the deaths were unintentional. Unintentional injuries are those that appear to occur by chance. Intentional injuries are those that appear to have been planned or are inflicted by a person. Suicide and Homicide are intentional injuries. The classification of injuries into two categories, intentional and unintentional, allows emphasis to be placed on prevention activities. The phrase ""unintentional injury"" is used in this document interchangeably with accident. Unintentional injuries are generally understandable, predictable, and most importantly, preventable. Understanding injury patterns is key to prevention. Each type of unintentional injury has a particular pattern, based on the following factors:       Age Gender Developmental level: physical, mental, emotional Presence of injury opportunities such as all-terrain vehicles, backyard swimming pools, firearms, kerosene heaters, etc. Access to and use of bike helmets, seat belts, smoke detectors, etc. Lack of appropriate supervision  Several characteristics are common to most types of injuries. Nationally injury rates are greatest in:   Low socioeconomic groups, especially urban African-American children and American Indians/Alaska Natives Males  Nationally the leading causes of fatal childhood unintentional injury are motor vehicle accidents, fires/burns, drowning, falls, and poisoning.  27   The leading causes of unintentional injury deaths in Idaho in 1999 were motor vehicle accidents, drowning, and suffocation.

Traffic collisions are those occurring on a public roadway. Non-traffic collisions are those that occur on private property. In 1999 there were 48 MVA fatalities resulting from 46 separate collisions. Forty-four (44) of the fatalities and 42 accidents were classified as traffic. Four (4) fatalities and 4 accidents were classified as non-traffic. Statistics in this section use the number of fatalities (48) in the denominator unless otherwise noted.

Of the 3 pedestrians involved in traffic accidents, 1 was walking on the interstate in the dark, one was sitting in the roadway after dark, and one was crossing a highway and was under the influence of alcohol. Of the 3 cyclists that were involved in traffic accidents, 2 failed to stop at a stop sign, and 1 was riding on a highway at night without lights. The skateboarder was being pulled behind a car, fell, and was run over.

Research shows children are more likely to be restrained in vehicles if adults use seat belts. The statistics about safety devices include only those fatalities occurring in traffic accidents. Twenty five (25) of the 30 fatally injured children and teens age 4 or over in vehicles were not restrained.

Child Sa fe ty Se a t Correctl y Used at Ti m e of Collision  Only 2 of 5 children under the age of 4 were correctly restrained in a child safety seat at the time of the collision.

Yes 2 40%  No 3 60%  31   According to the ""Idaho Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System Report, 1999"" random phone survey conducted by the Bureau of Vital Records and Health Statistics   Over nine of ten (92.1%) Idaho adult residents with children under the age of 5 in their household reported that the child always rides in a child safety seat in the car. Nearly nine out of ten (89.1%) Idaho adult residents with children between the ages of 5 and 16 reported that the child wears a seatbelt always or nearly always while riding in a car.  Helmets save lives, just like seat belts do. According to research done at Harborview Medical Center Injury Prevention and Research Center at the University of Washington in Seattle, overall, helmets decrease the risk of head and brain injury by 85 to 88 percent and facial injury to the upper and mid face by 65 percent. None of the 6 children who died while on bicycles, skateboards, or motorcycles were wearing helmets at the time of their injury. Contributing Circumstances For every vehicle involved in a traffic collision in Idaho, the investigating officer may indicate up to 3 circumstances contributing to the cause of the collision on the collision report. Failure to yield was the most common contributing circumstance in fatal collisions involving children. Too fast for conditions and inattention were the second and third most common circumstances identified on vehicle collision reports. Contributing Circumstances Failure to yield Too fast for conditions Inattention Speeding Passed stop sign Im paired driver Overcorrected Distraction in / on vehicle No lights Mechanical Failure Bright headlights Tire defect Drove left of center Falling object Victim sitting in roadw ay Victim fell out of vehicle Poor w eather / Road conditions Im proper overtaking Vision obstruction Im proper backing Drow sy / Asleep  Number of collisions in which factor was present  0  2  4  6  8  10  12  32   The CMRT reviews from 1997-1999 reveal consistency in the contributing circumstances associated with fatal collisions in children. The top 3 contributing circumstances over 3 years are:    Inattention Driving too fast for conditions Speeding  Driving under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol is documented as Impaired Driver and is in the top 7 for all 3 years. Drugs and Alcohol There are 2 reasons making it difficult to link the impact of alcohol to fatal collisions involving children. 1. Idaho law requires only the blood of drivers and pedestrians dying in motor vehicle collisions to be tested for alcohol (Idaho Code 49-1314). At fault drivers who do not die may not be tested for alcohol/drugs. 2. Results from the tests that are performed are not always available. Of the 46 motor vehicle traffic collisions that resulted in 48 child fatalities, 28 of the drivers of vehicle(s) involved in the collisions were tested for drugs and / or alcohol. Of the 28 tested, 8 had positive results of substance(s) in the bloodstream, 8 of the results were unavailable at the time of review, and the other 13 had negative results. In 1999 the review team was able to positively identify 7 collisions in which alcohol contributed to the collision:     In 2 collisions the child who died was driving with a blood alcohol level at or above the legal limit. In 2 collisions the child was a passenger in a vehicle being driven by a driver under the influence of alcohol. In 1 bicycle/ car collision the driver of the vehicle was under the influence of alcohol. In 1 pedestrian collision the pedestrian was under the influence of alcohol  Young Drivers According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, on the basis of miles driven, teenagers are involved in three times as many fatal crashes as are all drivers. Why do young drivers have such poor driving performance? Three factors work together to make the teen years so deadly for young drivers:  33   Inexperience: All young drivers start out with very little knowledge or understanding of the complexities of driving a motor vehicle. Like any other skill, learning to drive well takes a lot of time. Risk-taking behavior and immaturity: Adolescent impulsiveness is a natural behavior, but it results in poor driving judgment and participation in high-risk behaviors such as speeding, inattention, drinking and driving, and not using a seat belt. Peer pressure also often encourages risk taking. Greater risk exposure: Teen drivers are different from other drivers, and their crash experience is different. Compared to other drivers, a higher proportion of teenagers are responsible for their fatal crashes because of their own driving errors:     A larger percentage of fatal crashes involving teenage drivers are single vehicle crashes. The vehicle usually leaves the road and overturns or hits a roadside object such as a tree or a pole. In general, a smaller percentage of teens wear their seat belts compared to other drivers. A larger proportion of teen fatal crashes involve speeding, or going too fast for road conditions, compared to other drivers. Two of three teens who die as passengers are in vehicles driven by other teenagers. Single Ve hicle Tra ffic Collisions by Age in Ida ho 1999  Older children were more likely to die in single vehicle accidents such as rollovers, although the number of multiple car accidents in this age group increased as well.  25 20 15 10 5 0  <1 Multiple V ehic le  1- 4 5- 14 Single V ehic le  15- 17*  The following are examples of deaths that might have been prevented. Victim in vehicle driven by underage driver who lost control on gravel road. Vehicle rolled. The victim, who was not wearing a seatbelt, was ejected. Driver and other passenger, who were wearing seatbelts, sustained injuries but survived. Victim failed to yield to an oncoming semi-truck. Victim was not wearing a seatbelt. Passenger was wearing a seatbelt and sustained injuries but survived.  34   Motor Vehicle Non-traffic Accidents Non-traffic accidents occur on private property so law enforcement does not complete a collision record thus there is less information available for review. The following case summaries illustrate the variety of non-traffic accidents that occur.  A child was backed over in the family driveway. A child fell out of the back of a hay trailer. A child fell out of the back of a flatbed truck and was run over. A child riding a tricycle up and down the family driveway ran into a stock trailer passing by on the road.  1999 Conclusions and recommendations  The team recommends a standard (primary) seat belt law that covers all ages and all seating positions based on the following information from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Seat belts work. They are the most effective means of reducing fatalities and serious injuries when traffic crashes occur and are estimated to save 9,500 lives in America each year. Research has found that lap/shoulder belts, when used properly, reduce the risk of fatal injury to front seat passenger car occupants by 45 % and the risk of moderate-to-critical injury by 50 %. For light truck occupants, seat belts reduce the risk of fatal injury by 60 % and moderate-to-critical injury by 65 %. http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/people/injury/airbags/presbelt/america_seatbelt.html The team recommends child safety restraint education for parents based on the following information from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Child safety seats work. Children, especially those under the age of 5, are vulnerable in collisions because of the size and shape of their bodies. The child safety seat is designed to spread the forces of a crash over more of the body for front-facing toddlers, and cradle the fragile neck and back of the rear-facing infant. Child safety seats are the most effective occupant protection devices used in motor vehicles today. If used correctly, they are 71 % effective in reducing fatalities in children under the age of 5 and 69 % effective in reducing the need for hospitalization. About 50 % of children under age 5 who died in crashes were 35   unrestrained. Of the remaining 50 %, 26 % were in an adult seat belt which does not provide effective protection for most children under age 5. Others were in a child restraint system, but had not been restrained properly. In studies conducted by NHTSA to observe child safety seat misuse, nearly 80 % of the child seats observed were misused in one or more ways. In some cases, the seat was not properly attached to the vehicle; in others, the child was not appropriately buckled into the seat. http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/people/injury/airbags/presbelt/america_seatbelt.html  Proper Child Safety Seat Use Chart Buckle Everyone.

""Kids Aren't Cargo"" a public safety campaign from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration tells of the dangers of riding in the open bed of a pickup and how those dangers can be prevented. The dangers include:   Nationally children and teenagers account for more than half of the deaths of passengers riding in the bed of a truck. Ejection is the most significant cause of injury and death for pickup truck cargo area passengers in collisions. Even if no collision occurs, cargo area passengers can fall out during swerving, braking or on rough roads. One third of non-collision deaths occurred when victims are standing up, sitting on the tailgate or ""horsing around."" www.nhtsa.dot.gov/people/outreach/safesobr/18qp2/cpsw18.htm    36   The team supports the Department of Education proposed revised rules for driver's education. The draft proposed rules include minimum course standards for the delivery of teen driver education and training. The standards for the teen driver education and training program are the same for public and commercial schools. While a majority of the commercial school owners support minimum standards for teen driver education and training, some commercial schools want licensing without regulations. The Idaho Department of Education must exercise a degree of administrative discretion, consistent with the intent of the governing rule or law, to carry out its duties. Teen driver education is a public safety and health issue and the proposed draft rules for minimum standards for teen driver education and training take this into consideration. The team recommends that drivers education address at a minimum information on the dangers of:        Failure to yield the right of way Running or rolling through stop signs Driving too fast for conditions (especially ice or snow) Exceeding the posted speed limit Following too close Running or pushing the red light Failing to use safety restraints  The team makes the following recommendations for improving bicycle safety in Idaho:        Provide motorist education on sharing roadways safely. Develop bike lanes and paths to accommodate bicyclists. Provide access and linkage between bike paths and lanes. Provide safe bicycling routes around schools. Provide bicycle safety education to children and their parents including the importance of helmet use. Provide low cost bicycle helmets. Enforce existing bicycle-related regulations.  37   DROWNING AND SUBMERSION  Drowning is the second leading cause of injury-related death for children aged 1 through 14 years. Knowledge is a powerful tool for combating these tragedies. Knowing how and where children drown provides a basis for prevention. In Idaho in 1999, 7 deaths of children under the age of 18 were identified and presented to the team. All 7 were reviewed and all were determined to be definitely preventable. Nationally, drowning rates are highest for children under 5 years of age and persons 15-24 years of age. Young children are irresistibly drawn to water. The majority of childhood drowning deaths occur in a matter of seconds, usually when a child is left unattended or during a brief lapse in supervision In Idaho in 1999, 4 drowning deaths were children under the age of 5. 3  Idaho Drowning De aths by Age , 1999  2  1  0 <1 1-4 5 -9 1 0 -1 4 15-1 7  Nationally in 1999, 70% of children between the ages of 1 and 17 who died from drowning were male.

For example, children under age 1 most often drown in bathtubs, buckets, and toilets. Children 1-4 most often drown in swimming pools, hot tubs, or spas. Children aged 5-14 typically drown in swimming pools or open water, such as lakes and rivers.  IDAHO DEATH Age of Child <1 1-4 1-4 1-4 5-14 5-14 15-17  S BY DROWNING 1999 Location of Drowning Bathtub Canal Fish Pond Swimming Pool Swimming Pool Canal Reservoir  In Idaho in 1999 there was 1 drowning death in open water, unlike 1998 when 7 of the 12 drowning deaths under the age of 18 occurred in rivers. Taking simple prevention measures and close supervision of children can help protect them from drowning. Six (6) of the 7 drowning deaths in Idaho in 1999 had lack of supervision as a contributing factor. A child fenced on the bottom drowned in the family swimming pool in their back yard. The pool was and locked with a picnic table against the fence. The adult supervisor was phone when the child was noticed to be missing. The child was found at the of the pool.  A child was playing in the front yard. The adult supervisor went into a motor home for no more than 5 minutes. When the adult came back, the child was missing. The child was found in a canal near his home.  39   1999 Conclusions and recommendations The team recommends that public education be provided on the following:  Small children should NEVER be left unsupervised around any container of water large enough for the child to get their head in. This includes mop buckets, toilets, bathtubs, pools, spas and open bodies of water such as canals, rivers and reservoirs. Children should wear a U.S. Coast Guard-approved personal flotation device (PFD) when on boats, near open bodies of water, and when participating in water sports that do not require swimming. Water wings are not considered safety devices and are not substitutes for PFD. Parents should not rely on PFD or swimming lessons alone to protect children. Pools and spas should be fenced. Fences should be at least 5 feet tall, foursided (to prevent access from the house), and have self-closing and selflatching gates. Items that could be used by children to provide access over fencing (such as tables and chairs) should not be pushed up against pool fences. Children under the age of 15 years should not operate personal watercraft.         40   FIRE AND BURNS  In Idaho in 1999, 5 children lost their lives in 2 separate fires. All 5 deaths were presented to the team; all were determined to be definitely preventable. The national statistics and information presented in this section are reported by the National SAFEKIDS Campaign. Children ages 5 and under are more than twice as likely to die in a fire as the rest of the population. In Idaho in 1999, 2 of the 5 children were under the age of 6. Ida ho Fi re Re la te d De a ths, Age < 18, 1999  2  1  0 1-4 5-9 10-15  Nationally, more than 70% of all fire-related deaths are from smoke inhalation caused by toxic gases produced as fires develop and spread. In Idaho in 1999 all 5 of the fire related deaths were due to smoke inhalation. Children are often at risk due to their own curiosity. Studies indicate that an estimated 38 percent of children ages 6 to 14 have played with fire at least once. Child-play fires are the leading cause of fire-related death for children 5 and under. Nearly 80 percent of these are started with matches or lighters. Boys are nearly twice as likely as girls to play with fire. In Idaho in 1999, 2 of the children dying in 1 of the fires were thought to have been playing with matches. Children are at grave risk of injury and death from residential fires because they have less control of their environment than adults and limited ability to react appropriately. More than 40 percent of residential fire-related deaths among children ages 9 and under occur when the child is attempting to escape, is unable to act, or is acting irrationally. Children in homes without working smoke alarms are at the greatest risk. Households without working smoke alarms are approximately two and a half times more likely to have a fire. In Idaho in 1999, 3 of the children dying in 1 of the fires were sleeping at the time of the fire and were found in an area of the residence that would suggest they were trying to get out. It is unknown if smoke alarms were present or working at the time of the fire. Home fires and fire-related deaths are more likely to occur during the cold weather months, December through February, when there is a significant rise in the use of portable or area heating equipment such as fireplaces, space heaters and wood stoves. 41   Three (3) children died in 1 fire. The fire occurred during the cold weather months and was determined to be due to blocked vents on the heater.  1999 Conclusions and recommendations The team supports the public education efforts of fire departments regarding smoke alarms and fire prevention including:     Changing batteries in smoke alarms twice a year when daylight savings time changes. Replacing smoke alarms every 10 years. Providing a low or no cost source for smoke alarms. Providing education that combustible materials must be kept away from heaters and electrical connections.  42   FIREARMS [UNINTENTIONAL]  In Idaho in 1999 there were 2 unintentional firearm deaths. Both were reviewed by the team and determined to be definitely preventable. All children are potentially at risk for unintentional firearm injury regardless of whether there are guns in the home or children know the rules about handling guns. Knowing how and why the injuries occur can substantially reduce the risk. According to the National SAFEKIDS Campaign nearly all childhood unintentional shooting deaths occur in or around the home. Half occur in the home of the victim and nearly 40 percent occur at a friend or relative's house. Most of these deaths involve guns that have been kept loaded and accessible to children and occur when children play with the guns. In Idaho in 1999, 1 death occurred at home and 1 while hunting. Rates of unintentional firearm-related injury are higher in rural areas, where people are more likely to own firearms. Shootings in rural areas are more likely to occur outdoors with a shotgun or rifle; in cities, most shootings occur indoors with a handgun. In Idaho in 1999 both unintentional shootings were with a rifle or shotgun. One occurred outdoors while hunting. The other occurred at the victim's home while loading and unloading rifles. Boys are far more likely to be injured and die from firearm-related incidents than girls. Of children killed in unintentional shootings, nearly 80 percent are male. In Idaho in 1999 both unintentional firearm victims were male. A teenager was hunting with 3 friends. Evidence and testing of the shotgun showed that the gun was probably dropped and it discharged. A teenager was at home with a friend. They were handling 2 rifles, loading and unloading them. One of the rifles was dropped and it fired.  43   SUFFOCATION AND STRANGULATION  In 1999, 6 children died from unintentional suffocation or strangulation. All of these deaths were reviewed. Five (5) of the 6 were determined to be definitely preventable and the preventability of 1 was unable to be determined.  In Idaho in 1999, 4 children died due to strangulation and 2 children died due to airway obstruction/aspiration.  Idaho Deaths Due to Suffocation/Strangulation, 1999 3 2 1 0 Strangul1-i4 n at o Suffocation  5-9 10-14 Age in years  15-17  1999 Conclusions and recommendations The team recommends public education to increase awareness of:     The problem of choking. Items that can present a choking hazard. Ages at which children are at highest risk for choking by various items. The importance of adult supervision when young children are eating and playing.  The team acknowledges that complete removal of all choking hazards is unlikely and recommends that all parents be trained in infant and child foreign body airway obstruction.   Instruction on choking intervention should be incorporated into all layperson CPR and first aid courses. Health-care providers should provide parents and caregivers instruction in how to treat infant and child foreign body obstruction.  44   OTHER UNINTENTIONAL INJURIES  There were 5 deaths that occurred from other unintentional injuries. All 5 were determined to be definitely preventable. Following are summaries of the 5 cases.  Two children died while making a makeshift tunnel at a landfill. The walls collapsed and the children died of crushing injuries. One child died when crushed by a bale of hay being unloaded with a forklift. One child died after a homemade cannon exploded. One child died from a pulmonary hemorrhage. Pathologists concluded it was caused by gastric contents or possibly some kind of inhalant.  1999 Conclusions and recommendations  The team recommends parent education on how to determine which farm-related tasks are appropriate at given ages. Guidelines can be found at: www.extension.umn.edu/distribution/youthdevelopment/DA6188.html. The team recommends adult supervision during hay unloading operations. Guidelines for enssuring children are ready and able to be involved in hay unloading operations can be found at: www.nagcat.org/poster/hay/loadhay.htm  45   INTENTIONAL SELF-HARM (SUICIDE)  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 1999 suicide was the third leading cause of death for young people 10-17 years in the United States and the second leading cause of death for the same age group in Idaho. Idaho was ranked 4th in the nation in 1999 for the rate of suicide injury deaths of children aged 10 to 17 years. Twelve (12) suicides occurred in Idaho in 1999. All 12 cases were reviewed by the team and were determined to be definitely preventable. Ten (10) of those who died from suicide were ages 15-17. Two (2) of the victims were under the age of 15. Although suicide among children ages 10-14 is considered a rare event, Idaho had 4 deaths in both 1997 and 1998 in the 10-14 age group.

The teenager reportedly had below average grades, interpersonal problems with friends, and had been grounded and was unable to attend a family function. A teenager committed suicide by shooting. The teenager had a history of depression and alcohol/drug use and had made prior suicide attempts. Data Gaps  The team was challenged by the lack of a consistent investigation of suicide deaths and the lack of information regarding the medical, social, and psychological history of the victim. 1999 Conclusions and recommendations The team supports the Department of Health and Welfare and their public and private partners in the development of a statewide suicide prevention plan. We would like to see the following issues addressed in the plan:        Promote public awareness that adolescent suicide is a problem that can be prevented. Work with the media to ensure news coverage of suicides is not sensationalized. Work with staff at schools having had a student suicide to ensure that response to the suicide is not sensationalized and to support peers in an effort to prevent future suicides. Provide training to primary care providers and natural community helpers on recognizing and responding to adolescents showing signs of suicide risk. Include information on referral resources. Provide information to parents of children who are at risk for suicide on recognizing and responding to signs of potential attempts. Provide information on referral resources. Provide information to parents of adolescents at risk for suicide on the necessity of securing guns and ammunition. Provide professional education to improve suicide investigations by thorough collection of medical histories, improved scene investigations, enhanced systems for conducting psychological autopsies, and toxicological exams.  47   ASSUALT (HOMICIDE)  The rate of homicide in Idaho is lower than the United States. There were 7 deaths due to homicide in Idaho in 1999. All 7 were presented to the team. Six (6) cases were reviewed. Of the 6 reviewed cases, all were determined to be definitely preventable. The 1 death that was not reviewed was originally diagnosed as SIDS and the investigation was still pending at the time of review. This death was later determined to be homicide after a confession and a subsequent conviction. This death is included in the following statistics although preventability was not determined by the team. The United States Bureau of Justice Statistics reported in 1999 that the killing of children under the age of 5 years increased in the last 2 decades but has recently been on the decline. In Idaho in 1999, 6 of the 7 (85.7%) victims of homicide were less than 5 years old. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, a parent, including stepparents, is the perpetrator in most homicides of children under age 5. Five (5) of the 7 (71.4%) homicide death victims in Idaho in 1999 were killed by a parent (2 by fathers, 3 by mothers). Two (2) children died as the result of a double homicide followed by suicide of the father.  1999 Conclusions and recommendations The team recommends that public education take place to raise awareness that all citizens become aware of signs of child abuse and that citizens be educated on the signs that indicate that a parent or caretaker is too stressed to care for a child. An abused or neglected child is one whose physical or psychological health or development is harmed by the parents' (or caretaker's) behavior. Child abuse includes physical abuse, physical neglect, sexual abuse and emotional abuse of a child under 18 years of age by a parent- or by another family member or caretaker.  48   Types of Abuse Physical Abuse  What does that mean? A non-accidental injury to a child by a parent or caretaker.  How do I recognize It? You may see frequent and unexplained bruises, burns, cuts, injuries; the child may be overly afraid of the parent's reaction to misbehavior. You may see a very young child routinely left alone at home. You may know that a severe illness or injury is not being medically treated. A neighbor child may frequently turn up at your door-inadequately dressed for the weather-saying their parent told them to stay away. Physical neglect can be hard to judge; sometimes what you see is poor judgment, but not neglect. Sometimes what you see is the result of poverty, not parental neglect. You may observe sexual behavior way beyond what is expected for the child's age; a young child might have sudden, unusual difficulty with toilet habits; there may be pain or itching, bruises or bleeding in the genital area. The child might tell you.  Physical Neglect  A parent or caretaker's failure to give the child food, clothing, hygiene, medical care and supervision.  Sexual Abuse  Ranges from offenses such as promoting prostitution, to fondling, intercourse, or using the child for pornographic materials.  49   MANNER UNDETERMINED  For 3 deaths to children in 1999 the manner could not be determined, even after autopsy. A child died from asphyxiation. A young child died from herniation of the brainstem. A young child died from a skull fracture.  50   FIREARMS IN INJURY DEATHS  This section contains aggregate data and includes unintentional injury, intentional injury, and deaths with undetermined intent. There were 13 firearm deaths of children in Idaho in 1999. Firearms were the second leading cause of injury death in Idaho in 1999. Only motor vehicle accidents claimed more young lives. The majority of firearm deaths were due to suicide. In 11 cases the weapon was used to intentionally harm (suicide and homicide). In 2 cases a loaded weapon was dropped. 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 Idaho Fir ear m Dea th by Manner Ages 0-17 19 99  8 Su icid e  3 Hom icid e  2 Accid ent  Nearly two-thirds (62.5 %) of suicides by firearm were committed with a rifle.

Almost 1 in 9 (11.6%) adults with children less than 18 years of age has a loaded gun in the home. Approximately 1 in 24 (4.2%) adults with children less than 18 years of age has a loaded gun in his/her vehicle.  Nearly half (46.2%) of the firearms used in child deaths in Idaho in 1999 belonged to an adult member of the victim's family.  1999 Conclusions and recommendations The team recommends public education on firearm storage including the following messages:       Firearms should be stored unloaded and locked out of children's reach. Ammunition should be stored in a separate, locked location from firearms. Gun storage keys and lock combinations should be hidden in separate locations. Gun locks and load indicators could prevent more than 30 percent of all unintentional firearms deaths. (www.safekids.org) Low cost gun locks should be made available. Children should be taught the following by their caregivers: o Guns are dangerous. o Never touch or play with guns. o To tell an adult if they find a gun, or to call 911 if they find a gun when an adult is not present. o Gun violence on TV and in the movies is not real. Caregivers should check with neighbors, friends, relatives, or other adults in other homes where children visit to ensure they are following safe storage practices if firearms are in the home.    52   APPENDIX A THE OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT STATE OF IDAHO BOISE EXECUTIVE ORDER NO. 98-10 CHILD MORTALITY REVIEW TEAM WHEREAS, the health and safety of Idaho children are of primary importance; and WHEREAS, the child death rate in Idaho exceeds that of the nation; and WHEREAS, some child deaths are due to preventable causes; and WHEREAS, records of children's deaths and circumstances leading to their death are kept by multiple agencies but not coordinated, on-going effort is being made to evaluate these records; and WHEREAS, expertise exists within the state to evaluate these records and identify circumstances leading to or contributing to the deaths of children; and WHEREAS, the identification of risk producing circumstances and recommendations to remediate them may reduce child death rates; NOW THEREFORE, I, PHILIP E.

PHILIP E. BATT GOVERNOR PETE T. CENARRUSA SECRETARY OF STATE  54   APPENDIX B  TECHNICAL NOTES REGARDING SIGNIFICANCE TESTING For significant testing of all rates contained in this report: p=.05. Three statistical tests were performed for each cause, area, or year. If the test outcomes did not match, the more frequent outcome was reported. For causes, areas, or years in which the rate is based on 100 or more events, the following tests were performed: 1) Evaluate overlapping confidence intervals at p=.05. If the confidence intervals of the rates do not overlap, the rates are significantly different. 2) Evaluate the test statistic. If the z statistic is greater than or equal to the test statistic (1.96), the rates are significantly different. 3) If the confidence interval for the ratio of rates does not contain the value of 1, the rates are significantly different. For causes, areas, or years in which the rate is based on less than 100 events, the following tests were performed: 1) Evaluate overlapping confidence intervals at p=.05. If the confidence intervals of the rates do not overlap, the rates are significantly different. 2) Evaluate the test statistic. If the Difference of Rates is greater than or equal to the z statistic, the rates are significantly different. 3) If the confidence interval of the Difference in Rates does not contain the value of 0, the rates are significantly different. TECHNICAL NOTES REGARDING THE ICD-9 / ICD-10 CONVERSION Cause-of-Death Classification Mortality statistics are compiled in accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) regulations, which specify that member nations, including the United States, classify and code causes of death in accordance with the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems. The tenth revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) was implemented in the United States beginning with deaths occurring in 1999 and replaces the ninth revision of the ICD (ICD-9), which was used from 1979 through 1998. Some changes from ICD-9 to ICD-10 include: 1. ICD-10 is far more detailed than ICD-9, with about 8,000 categories compared to 4,000 categories. 2. ICD-10 uses 4-digit alphanumeric codes, compared to 4-digit numeric codes in ICD-9. 3. Some cause-of-death titles have been changed, and conditions have been regrouped. 4. Some cause-of-death coding rules have been changed.  55   Comparability Ratio The change from ICD-9 to ICD-10 may result in discontinuities in cause-of-death trends. These discontinuities are measured using comparability ratios. The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) developed comparability ratios to measure the level of agreement between classification systems for causes of death. The comparability ratio is the result of a study completed by the NCHS in which a sample of the U.S. mortality data file was coded by both the new (ICD-10) and the old revision (ICD-9) codes. Comparability ratio: Number of deaths for a cause of death based on ICD-10 code(s)________ Number of deaths for a cause based on the most comparable ICD-9 code(s) A comparability ratio of 1.00 indicates that the same number of deaths were assigned to a particular cause whether ICD-9 or ICD-10 was used. A comparability ratio of less than 1.00 indicates fewer deaths occurred in 1999 compared with 1976-1998, solely because of the revision of the ICD. For example, a ratio of 0.98 (MVA deaths) indicates there were 2% fewer deaths (1.00-0.98) for this cause because of the code revision. A comparability ratio of more than 1.00 indicates more deaths occurred from this cause in 1999 compared with 1976-1998, only because of the implementation of ICD-10. A ratio of 1.04 (SIDS deaths) indicates 4% more deaths (absolute difference of 1.04-1.00) were attributed to the cause using ICD-10 than would have been using ICD-9. Comparability ratios for select causes of death have been revised since preliminary comparability ratios were released. NCHS revised ratios for motor vehicle accidents. The comparability ratio for motor vehicle accidents was updated after a change in the classification of motor vehicle accidents. Originally, for a death to be classified as a motor vehicle accident in ICD-10, it must be explicit that the injury involved a ""motor"" vehicle, even if the injury occurred on a highway or road. In ICD-9, the absence of the term ""motor"" or when a vehicle accident was reported as occurring on a highway or road, the assumption was to classify the accident as involving a motor vehicle. ICD-10 did not allow for this assumption and such accidents are categorized as ""Other"" land transport accidents. Since the implementation of ICD-10, however, for U.S. data, it has been decided that, if an accident occurred on a highway or road, classification to motor vehicle accident is appropriate. Idaho data published prior to this report may not reflect this change. Since this update was implemented, Idaho deaths due to motor vehicle accidents have been revised and are comparable to U.S. data. Revised data are available upon request. To show trends in data, NCHS has instructed states to treat ICD-10 as the standard and adjust statistics prior to 1999 using comparability ratios. Therefore, mortality statistics provided in this report are NOT comparable to previously published mortality statistics based on ICD-9 codes.  56   For example, in 1999 there were 21 Idaho resident deaths from SIDS based on ICD-10 codes. In 1998, there were 20 deaths from SIDS, based on the ICD-9 codes. At first glance, one would conclude the number of SIDS deaths increased by 5% from 1998 to 1999. However, because of changes in coding rules for ICD, these two counts are not comparable. Beginning in 1999 a change in Rule A affects the coding of SIDS deaths. In ICD-9 SIDS was treated as an ill-defined condition and ignored in the presence of other better-defined conditions listed on the death certificate. In ICD-10, SIDS is not considered to be ill-defined. Thus, in ICD-10, SIDS may be selected as the underlying cause of death even when other conditions are listed on the death certificate. Thus, deaths classified as SIDS in ICD-10 may have been classified to other causes using ICD-9. The ICD-10 to ICD-9 comparability ratio for SIDS is 1.04. In other words, the counts and rates for SIDS were expected to increase 4% beginning in 1999 only because of the introduction of ICD-10. To compare the number of SIDS deaths in 1998 with the number of deaths in 1999 multiply 1998 data by the comparability ratio. Number of deaths in 1998 (not comparable with 1999 data) 20 Number of deaths in 1998, comparable with number of deaths in 1999 (rounded) 21 Number of deaths in 1999 21  X  Comparability Ratio 1.04  =  In this report, trend data are presented for SIDS, Motor Vehicle Accidents, Suicide, and Firearm deaths.

The Hmong Healthcare Practices in Orange County: Results from the Hmong Health Survey report attempts to fill a gap in knowledge within the county regarding the health of Hmong-Americans, a group which has unique socio-cultural features that may complicate the delivery of healthcare services. Results from the survey illustrate the condition of Hmong-Americans in Orange County:  It suggests high proportions of Hmong-Americans are without health insurance, are not participating in health-promoting behaviors, and lack knowledge about access to and navigation of the County's healthcare system.  It affirms the need to address linguistic isolation as a meaningful barrier to healthcare access.  It reinforces the need for health providers to prepare themselves, their facilities, and staff to provide culturally competent medical care and health-promoting services to their Hmong-American clientele. Professionals are encouraged to reach out to Hmong-Americans in a manner that respects and encourages their native lifestyles, while facilitating access to and adaptation of those mainstream behaviors and medicines that promote health. We hope you will use this report to identify the health needs of the Hmong-Americans in your community--and to challenge your organization to respond to these unique needs.

Many suffer from the difficulties associated with low socio-economic status, cultural dissonance, low levels of education, linguistic isola tion, and difficulties in accessing health care. In order to describe health care among Hmong-Americans in Orange County, we conducted a survey that was administered by a Hmong-speaking researcher within the Hmong-American community. The Hmong Health Survey yielded several important findings.  Results suggested many Hmong-Americans in Orange County might not be engaging in health promotion behaviors. Thirty-six percent of respondents reported not participating in any preventive health maintenance behaviors.  A large proportion of Hmong-Americans in Orange County may lack access to basic medical services since over 30% of Hmong surveyed were uninsured.  Substantial linguistic barriers may exist which inhibit optimal medical care. Only one in ten respondents had doctors who spoke their language. Among those linguistically incompat ible with their physician, over four in ten never had their doctor provide translation ser vices, and almost one in four never brought a translator to a doctor visit. Subsequently, it is possible significant linguistic barriers to proper medical treatments exist among Hmong in the county.  Over half of Hmong-Americans surveyed used Hmong and/or Chinese herbal remedies. Physicians should be aware that such treatments might be performed prior to, during the course of, or in lieu of conventional Western medical techniques.  Many of those surveyed were unaware of the availability of low cost medical services provided by the County of Orange. Two of three respondents were unaware of such services, suggesting additional efforts may be necessary in educating this community about their health care options.  Results suggest the dissemination of county health care information to Hmong-Americans would be best communicated in Hmong or Lao languages within home and community center settings.  1  Results From the Hmong Health Survey   Hmong Healthcare Practices in Orange County INTRODUCTION It has been a quarter of a century since the first significant wave of Hmong refugees resettled in the United States. Some have been able to adjust to the new environment, while others were unprepared for the cultural differences they experienced. For these persons, it has been difficult, often frustrating, to learn the language, living skills, traditions, regulations, and job skills necessary to function effectively in the U.S. Hmong in the United States suffer from a high degree of poverty, with a 1990 median household income of $14,327 (True and Guillermo, 1996). According to 1990 U.S. Census statistics, over 60% of HmongAmericans live in poverty; less than 6% have completed college; and only 29% participate in the labor force (President's Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, 2001). Cultural differences and misunderstandings also complicate interactions between Hmong-Americans and Ameri can institutions (Barrett et al., 1998). Consequently, this sub-population has encountered significant barriers to the access and utilization of health care services in the United States. Prior to this report, there had been no formal attempts to characterize the cultural and linguistic issues affecting Hmong-American access to health care in Orange County. This report describes aspects of Hmong-American use of Western medicine, adherence to traditional medical practices, linguistic barriers, medical problems and knowledge/attitudes regarding county medical services in Orange County. The Hmong Health Survey was also intended to inform future efforts of a similar nature. This report contains a brief background of Hmong history, details methods used in data acquisition, presents and interprets survey findings, and discusses recommendations based upon key results.  History of the Hmong The Hmong are a people with a long and sometimes turbulent past. However, due to the relatively recent development of a written Hmong language and to multiple geographic migrations, much of Hmong history beyond 5,000 years ago remains speculative. The Hmong originated in Northern China, where they competed with the Chinese for rich soil along the banks of the Yellow River (Quincy, 1995). The Chinese made war on the Hmong and drove them South to what today is known as the Hupeh and Hunan prov inces, where the Hmong then established an independent kingdom. In the tenth century, the Hmong were conquered, and thousands taken as slaves. Those who escaped the Hupeh/Hunan region fled to the mountainous areas of Kweichow, Szechwan, and Yunnan, where, in the 18th and 19th centuries, they were again attacked by the Chinese (Quincy, 1995). Thousands of Hmong then fled China to Northern Vietnam, Laos, Thailand and Burma (Mottin, 1980). Many made their home in the mountain ranges of Laos, Burma, Thailand and Vietnam. In 1961, General Vang Pao, a Hmong leader in Laos, was appointed by the United States Central Intelli gence Agency to raise an army of Hmong and train them in intelligence and combat tactics as Special Guerrilla Units (SGU) against North Vietnamese and Pathet-Lao communists. During their fifteen years of armed service, skilled Hmong units protected American personnel, rescued American pilots, and dis rupted the flow of communist military personnel, supplies, trucks, and tanks traveling along the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Such involvement resulted in thousands of Hmong military casualties as well as the death of many Hmong civilians. After the United States withdrew from Southeast Asia in 1975, nearly 300,000 men, women and children primarily of Hmong descent were killed by Lao communists in their homes or while attempting escape to Thailand (United Nations, 2000). Aggression against Hmong by the PathetLao regime continues and is now supported by Vietnamese troops, in what has been described as ""ethnic cleansing"" (United Nations, 2000). Hmong have since resettled throughout the world as political refu gees. According to Census 2000 figures, approximately 169,428 Hmong now live within the United States, though other estimates have placed the figure closer to 300,000 (Hmong National Development, Inc., 2000). Currently, the U.S. Census estimates that between 962 and 1,126 Hmong-Americans live in Orange County, CA (U.S. Census, 2000), though this figure is also likely an undercount. Results From the Hmong Health Survey 2   Hmong Healthcare Practices in Orange County Hmong Health in the United States Peer review literature on the health of Hmong in the United States is relatively undeveloped. There have  been few studies on the prevalence or incidence of specific diseases, health outcomes, and behavioral  risk factors among this population,  which may be due in part to the rela  tively small number of Hmong-Ameri  cans, unique cultural and linguistic  features that impede scientific study,  and their recent arrival to the United  States.  Lifestyle factors, and their associated  chronic diseases, may be of primary  importance to understanding Hmong  health in the United States. Among the  most important of these changes are  those of a dietary nature. Traditionally,  the daily meal pattern of Hmong con  sisted of three meals plus snacks,  heavy use of rice, use of various veg  etables, and modest quantities of fish  and meats. However, younger Hmong-  Americans are increasingly consuming  Hmong Americans pick up tips at a health fair booth. fast foods high in cholesterol and fat.  Dietary acculturation among the Hmong in  America may be linked to an increased occurrence of obesity, particularly among Hmong youth (Himes et  al, 1992; Story and Harris, 1989). Such acculturation may increase risk for a variety of chronic diseases,  including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Hypertension, a known risk factor for cardiovascular  disease, was almost 3 times as high among Hmong boys, and one and a half times as high in girls,  compared to their respective African-American and White counterparts (Munger et al, 1991).  A study of cancer incidence rates among the Hmong of Central California was conducted using Cancer  Registry of Central California data from 1987 to 1994. The study suggested Hmong-Americans might  suffer elevated rates of cervical, nasopharyngeal, stomach, liver, and pancreatic cancers, as well as  leukemias and non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas, compared to all other race/ethnicities combined (Mills and  Yang, 1997). However, Hmong in Central California had lower rates of breast, prostate, and colorectal  cancers (Mills and Yang, 1997). The study also found higher rates of advanced stage disease upon  diagnosis among Hmong-Americans for a number of cancers. The authors suggested such phenomena  may be due to sociocultural impediments to healthcare access and utilization, including an aversion to  Western healthcare and low participation in cancer screening (Mills and Yang, 1997). Consistent with this  notion is research suggesting only 30% of Hmong women 20 and older living in Fresno, Long Beach,  Orange County, and San Diego have ever had a mammogram (Tanjasiri et al, 2001). By comparison,  among California women 18 and older, approximately 67% of Whites, 67% of African-Americans, and  47% of Latinas report ever having had a mammogram (CDC, 2000). Some studies have reported that  Hmong-American women may be deterred in having gynecological and breast examinations by aversions  to being touched by healthcare workers (Spring et al, 1995).   3  Results From the Hmong Health Survey   Hmong Healthcare Practices in Orange County Maternal and child health issues have also been studied among Hmong-Americans. Though Hmong children may be of lower birthweight than White, non-Hispanic children, Hmong children born in California from 1985 to 1988 were not statistically different from White, non-Hispanic children in terms of proportion with low-birthweight (Helsel et al, 1992). Hmong-American women in California may have higher parity (number of lifetime full-term births) and may be more likely to have children at younger (< 18 years of age) and older (> 40 years of age) ages than Whites (Helsel et al, 1992). Hmong-American women may also be much less likely to have Caesarean sections than White, non-Hispanic women regardless of age and parity (Helsel et al, 1992). It has been suggested that relatively few Hmong-American women may be engaging in breast-feeding (Jambunathan and Stewart, 1995; Tuttle and Dewey, 1994). Studies have suggested high rates of Hepatitis B (Gjerdingen and Lor, 1997; Catanzaro and Moser, 1982) and tuberculosis (Catanzaro and Moser, 1982) infection among Hmong in America. Emotional disorders related to familial and cultural separation, feelings of survivor's guilt, and post-traumatic stress disorder may serve as a hidden source of chronic morbidity among the Hmong (Mouanoutoua and Brown, 1995). Given manifestations of chronic disease and increases in harmful behavioral risk factors among Hmong Americans, health care access and utilization issues are of paramount importance within this population. Moreover, considering the poverty, lack of education, and linguistic isolation found among HmongAmericans (President's Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, 2001; True and Guillermo, 1996), the potential for problems related to health care access and utilization are substantial.  Results From the Hmong Health Survey  4   Hmong Healthcare Practices in Orange County RESULTS AND DISCUSSION This section summarizes the primary findings of the Hmong Health Survey. Results are divided into six sections: Demographic Characteristics, Health Status and Behaviors, Traditional Hmong Medicine, Use of Western Medicine, Ethnic and Linguistic Features of Physicians, and Awareness and Attitudes Regarding County Health Services. Methods employed in this report are reported in Appendix A.  Demographic Characteristics Table 1 shows demographic characteristics of survey respondents. Among those surveyed, there were slightly more males (58%) than fe males (42%). The mean age of respondents was 49 years. The majority of respondents were between forty and fifty-nine years of age (49%), while 23% were sixty years of age or older, and 28% were thirty-nine or younger. Among those who responded, 81% said they were married, 18% were widowed, and no respondents reported being single or divorced. Geographically, the Hmong community in Orange County is focused in the center of the region. Overall, 60% of those surveyed lived in Santa Ana or Fountain Valley. An extended Hmong family when they first arrived in Orange County. More specifically, 41% of those surveyed lived in  the city of Santa Ana within the 92703 and 92704  zip codes. An additional 25% of those surveyed lived within Garden Grove or Westminster. Lower pro-  portions of respondents lived within the areas of Anaheim (8%), Huntington Beach (6%), and Placentia (2%).

No subjects were born in the United States. As seen in Figure 1, the vast majority (76%) of Hmong respondents reported arriving in the United States between 1975 and 1984, with only 24% arriving after 1984. A particularly large proportion (41%) of respondents reported arriving during 1979 or 1980. Approximately a third (34%) of those surveyed reported having no formal education in the United States, while 76% reported four or fewer years of education in the U.S. Among those surveyed, 30% said they never went to school in their native country. Only 12% of respondents attended 12 or more years of school in their country of origin.  FIGURE 1. Percentage of Hmong Health Survey respondents reporting categories of year of arrival in the United States (n = 104).  Health Status and Behaviors Among those who responded to a question regarding self-rated health, 14% described their health as excellent, 33% reported being in good health, 9% considered themselves in fair health, while 9% reported their health was poor (Table 2). Interestingly, 21% of respondents said they did not know their health status, and 14% refused to answer. Women were 30% more likely to report poor/fair health as men, though this difference was not statistically significant. Those reporting per ceived barriers to healthcare were 70% more likely than those without barriers to report poor/fair health. Those having a regular doctor were 80% more likely to report poor/fair health than those without a regular doctor. Respondents using shamans were 20% more likely than those not using shamans to report poor/fair health.

Those having insurance were 40% less likely to report poor/fair health than those without insurance. Only those associations between selfreported poor/fair health with herbal remedy use and health promotion behavior approached statistical significance. Risk estimates and confidence intervals can be found in Appendix B. Respondents were also asked which preventive health behaviors they engaged in (Table 2). Thirty-six percent of respondents claimed to do no preventive health mainte nance. Almost a third of subjects (28%) stated they exercised to maintain health and approximately 26% identified diet as a means by which they stay healthy. Small percentages of respondents reported utilizing traditional (3%) and Western medicine (3%) for health maintenance. About 13% of respondents reported they did not know what they did to maintain health. Women were 50% more likely to report not participating in health promotion behaviors than men. Those Hmong-American respondents reporting barriers to healthcare were 70% more likely than those without perceived barriers to report doing nothing to maintain health. Those who reported having insurance were 40% less likely to report nonparticipation in health promotion behaviors than were those without insurance. None of these differences approached statistical significance. Risk estimates and confidence intervals can be found in Appendix B.  Traditional Hmong Medicine Many Hmong-Americans believe illness can be caused by both natural and supernatural phenomena (Henry, 1999). 7 Results From the Hmong Health Survey A Hmong American shaman about to begin a ritual ceremony.   Hmong Healthcare Practices in Orange County Hmong spiritual healers, called ""shamans,"" perform ceremonies to invoke assistance from the spirit world in treating illness. Shaman might be requested by the ill and are sometimes used in conjunction with Western medicine. Many Hmong in the United States use herbs for medicinal treatments. Treatments may include ingestion or application of herbal preparations, abdominal massage, herbal body massage, cupping, coin rubbing, and treatment with boiled eggs. Some ethno-pharmacologic research suggests a high proportion (92 percent) of plants used medicinally by the Hmong have biochemical properties that make them potentially effective by Western biomedical criteria (Spring, 1989), though it should be noted that their safety and effectiveness have not been formally evaluated. Consequently, Western medicine is sometimes considered only after traditional means of healing have proven ineffective, which may delay use of those medical treatments with the highest probability of success. In the Hmong Health Survey, respondents were asked if they consulted Hmong shaman (Figure 2). Approximately 41% (43 subjects) of respondents refused to answer this item. Of those 62 (59%) sub jects who responded, 44% reported consulting a shaman.  FIGURE 2. Percentage of Hmong Health Survey respondents reporting shaman consultation (n = 105). Of those 27 reporting consultation with Hmong shaman, 20 (74%) reported they see a shaman when ill. Fifteen respondents (55%) said that they might see a Shaman after having a bad dream or when they feel inhabited by a bad spirit. Use of medicinal herbs appears prevalent among those Hmong surveyed (Figure 3). Over half (58%) of respondents reported use of Hmong and/or Chinese herbal remedies. Approximately 8 percent of subjects used non-herbal traditional Hmong techniques, such as coin rubbing, cupping, and punching.  Results From the Hmong Health Survey  8   Hmong Healthcare Practices in Orange County  FIGURE 3. Percentage of Hmong Health Survey respondents reporting use of medicinal herbs (n = 105). Subjects reported using traditional medicinal remedies for a variety of symptoms, including fevers, body pain, headache, and colds. Approximately one out of ten respondents reported using traditional medici nal methods for all types of illnesses.  Use of Western Medicine Table 3 shows subject response to items regarding Western medical care. Of those Hmong-Americans surveyed, 33% were uninsured while an additional 28% were insured through Medicare, Medi-Cal, or Healthy Families. Only 35% reported having private medical insurance. Comparatively speaking, ap proximately 7% of Whites in Orange County are without insurance coverage (California Health Interview Survey, 2001). Almost all (90%) of those surveyed reported seeking medical care from private physi cians. However, only 45% said they have a regular doctor. Three persons said they did not know if they had a regular physician. Twenty-one percent visited their physician on a monthly basis, while one in four respondents reported going to the doctor once a year, and 29% of those surveyed said they visited their physician only when they were ill.  Ethnic and Linguistic Features of Physicians Due in part to the relatively recent arrival of Hmong to the United States and translation complexities, it is estimated that approximately 61% of Hmong-American households are linguistically isolated (President's Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, 2001). The U.S. Census Bureau defines linguistic isolation as ""a household in which no person age 14 or over speaks only English and no person age 14 or over who speaks a language other than English speaks English `very well' (U.S. Cen sus Bureau, 2000)."" Language barriers can make healthcare communication difficult and, at times, impossible. Adequate interpretation of the Hmong or Lao languages is often rare and inadequate inter pretation can itself lead to misunderstandings and subsequent mistreatment. Some Hmong-American parents may be forced to depend on teenagers or older children (Westermeyer and Her, 1996) for inter pretation. Often there is an absence of direct Hmong/English translation for medical terminology, neces sitating indirect approximations of actual meaning (Johnson, 2002).  9  Results From the Hmong Health Survey   Hmong Healthcare Practices in Orange County TABLE 3.

The majority (67%) of respondents see doctors of Asian ancestry, with the most common physi cian ancestry being Thai (39%). However, among those who see a doctor, 90% said the physician does not speak their language. Approximately 7% of those surveyed said their doctor provides translation services all of the time, 47% reported these services were provided some of the time, and 45% reported translation was never provided by their physician. Among respondents, 26% reported bringing a transla tor every time and another 48% bring a translator some of the time, while 24% never bring a translator. Respondents were also asked if they encountered barriers in seeing a doctor. Only 12 (11%) subjects claimed to have encountered such barriers. Twenty-six (25%) respondents did not answer this item.  Awareness and Attitudes Regarding County Health Services Table 5 summarizes awareness and attitudes of Hmong-American survey respondents towards Orange County medical services. Among those that responded, only 21% said they were aware of free or low cost medical services for low-income families. Such awareness did not vary significantly by insurance status. The overwhelming majority of respondents (83%) said they are interested in health services provided by the County of Orange Health Care Agency. However, only ten percent said that they wanted more information on specific health topics, while 78% responded ""Don't Know"" when asked if they wanted such information.

Two percent mentioned Khmu, which is a highlander ethnic language in Laos, while seven percent would like to see health informa tion written in English. When asked in which settings they would like to receive healthcare informa tion, 91% mentioned their home, 69% noted commu nity centers, and 23% said a hospital or private clinic setting (Table 5). Literature has also suggested integra tion of Hmong cultural themes of family and equilibrium, or the natural balance of opposites, as well as the use of Hmong folklore may aid in convey ing health messages (Frye, Sharing health information at the Hmong New Year Festival. 1995). 11 Results From the Hmong Health Survey   Hmong Healthcare Practices in Orange County TABLE 5.

Associations between health maintenance behaviors and selfreported health status, which approached statistical significance, may underscore the importance of health promotion in perception of overall wellness. These findings are consistent with literature suggest ing a high potential for increased obesity and associated chronic diseases among Hmong-Americans. Results from education items suggest a low degree of formal schooling, both in terms of education ob tained within the United States and within countries of origin. Approximately a third of respondents had no education from U.S. institutions, and a third reported having no education within their homeland. Many respondents told the interviewer their U.S. education consisted largely of English as a Second Language (ESL) classes. This lack of education may be impeding employment in occupations that offer health insurance benefits. Over a quarter of respondents reported consulting a Hmong shaman though a substantial proportion of those surveyed refused to answer this item. One possible explanation for this item's low response rate is that many Hmong are hesitant to admit they take part in such practices. Over half of respondents reported using Hmong or Chinese herbal medicines, and those who reported using herbal remedies were more likely to report poor/fair health, suggesting that use of herbal remedies may be a front-line treatment Results From the Hmong Health Survey 12   Hmong Healthcare Practices in Orange County among Hmong-Americans in Orange County and/or that herbal remedies are used but may not positively affect health status. These data collectively suggest many Hmong-Americans still subscribe to traditional means of healing and that participation in such practices must be considered when evaluating the health of this population. Approximately a third of respondents reported having no medical insurance, suggesting economic barriers to medical care might be substantial. Open-ended interview responses suggested some Hmong may be restricted from applying for Medi-Cal or Healthy Families programs by occupational and domestic respon sibilities. However, only one in ten respondents reported perceiving barriers to seeing a physician though one in four refused to answer this item. Among barriers mentioned in open-ended interviews were linguis tic problems, economic limitations and logistic issues regarding transportation. Modesty was also a perceived impediment. For example, in Laos, patients are not asked to undress in a doctor's office and, therefore, Hmong in the United States, particularly women, may be reluctant to expose their body or respond to the intimate questions often asked at a doctor's office. Almost all respondents received medical care from private physicians, yet only slightly less than half of those surveyed reported having a regular doctor. Results suggest those Hmong-Americans surveyed may prefer doctors of Asian ethnicity despite the persistence of linguistic barriers. There are some simi larities between the Thai and Laotian languages that facilitate communication between a Hmong patient and a Thai doctor, though such communication remains problematic. Only a small proportion of respon dents have doctors who speak their language, and translation services are inconsistently provided, with half of respondents reporting doctors sometimes or never provide translators. Given these language barriers, many clients are forced to bring their own interpreter, though results show this may also be inconsistent. Four in ten respondents reported they sometimes or never bring their own interpreter. Open-ended interviews suggest the interpreter brought by the patient may be a child or adolescent with little comprehension of medicine or its terminology. Half of those whose physician did not provide inter preting services did not bring a translator themselves, suggesting the potential for serious communication impediments to proper treatment. Results from the Hmong Health Survey also suggest there may be a low level of knowledge among the Hmong community in Orange County regarding county health services though a large majority of respon dents were interested in receiving more information regarding such services. The majority of respondents would prefer to receive materials in the Hmong language though results suggest Lao materials would also be well received by the Hmong community. Almost all of those surveyed said they would like to receive health information at their home, while many also mentioned a preference for community centers. Use of culturally relevant Hmong themes may also aid health communication. Additional research using more rigorous sampling methodologies within the Hmong-American population may be fruitful. Perhaps one day the Orange County Hmong-American community can cross the river of cultural and linguistic barriers to the mainstream western medical techniques that may serve as vital lines in the prevention and treatment of adverse health conditions.

First, a list of Orange County Hmong-Americans belonging to the United Lao Movement, a Hmong community organization, was acquired. Key informants were selected from this list of 119 members, contacted via telephone and asked to participate. Second, with the assistance of other community leaders, a native Hmong-speaking researcher gathered a convenience-sample of Hmong-Americans, recruiting participants through HmongAmerican community centers, churches, and temples in Orange County. The use of a single interviewer eliminated the potential for inter-interviewer biases. In all, one hundred and five Hmong refugees and immigrants agreed to participate. A single native Hmong-speaking researcher conducted interviews between March and September of 1999. Usually the respondent was the head of household. The sur vey/interview contained items on self-rated health, health promotion activities, use of traditional medicine, use of Western medicine, linguistic barriers, medical insurance, and education. Analysis of Hmong Health Survey data was performed using SPSS 10.1 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Chi-squares, odds ratios, and confidence intervals were calculated using CROSSTABS procedures in SPSS. There are several potential limitations of the current study. Currently, there is no single source from which a sampling frame for the Hmong-American population in Orange County could be derived. Subsequently, the external validity of this study may be questionable. However, given that 105 Hmong-Americans participated and that there are currently an estimated 986 to 1,126 Hmong in Orange County (U.S. Census, 2000), approximately nine to eleven percent of all Hmong-Americans in the county were sur veyed. Selection bias may have existed because it is not known how members of the United Lao Move ment and participants recruited from community centers, churches, and temples differ from HmongAmericans throughout the Orange County. Large degrees of non-response on items regarding Shaman use may indicate reporting bias, resulting in underestimations of adherence to traditional medical prac tices. Also, data on income were not collected making it difficult to assess the intervening effect of socio economic status on healthcare phenomenon among Hmong-Americans. Finally, the study was con ducted in a cross sectional manner, making the temporality of associations derived from Hmong Health Survey data unclear. Measures of point estimates and measures of association may also be unstable due to the small sample size.

Overview of the Child Fatality Data for 1998  A total of 1,057 fatalities among resident children under age 18 were recorded on Tennessee death  certificates by the Office of Health Statistics and Information, Tennessee Department of Health, in 1998. This represents a fatality rate of 78.0 deaths per 100,000 children (based on the 1997 population figures showing 1,355,319 resident children in Tennessee under age 18).  This report is based on 1,042 of the 1,057 child fatalities reviewed by the child fatality review teams  (CFRT). The report reflects the team' findings after multidisciplinary review of the cause and s circumstances of death. Therefore, the statistics in this report may differ slightly from others based solely on death certificate information.  The manner of death was determined by the CFRT to be natural causes for 73% of the fatalities,  unintentional injuries for 19%, violence-related (homicide or suicide) for 6%, and unknown for 2%. [Figure 1]  Figure 1: Number of Deaths by Manner of Death (All Cases) 800 756  600  400  202 200 64 20 0 Natural Unintentional Injuries Violence Other   The CFRT agreed with the manner of death indicated on the death certificate in 83% of the cases and  determined a different manner of death for 2%. For 14% of the child fatalities, the manner of death was not indicated on the death certificate and was determined by the CFRT.  -1-    The CFRT judged the death certificate to be inadequate or incomplete in 28% of the cases and in 2%  of the cases deemed the investigation into the death to be inadequate.  Fifty-nine percent of child fatalities were children less than one year old, most of whom died of  natural causes, with 20% surviving less than one day after birth. The next largest age category was for children 16-17 years old (12%), most of whom died of unintentional injuries.

The next highest fatality rate was for African-American males under one year of age (1511.8 per 100,000), followed by AfricanAmerican females under one year of age (1435.8 per 100,000). These rates were more than twice the corresponding rates for white males (684.0 per 100,000) and females (567.8 per 100,000) under one year of age. [Table 2]  Past the first year of life, male youth aged 16-17 had the highest fatality rates. Among that age group,  the rates for African-American males were slightly higher than for white males. Overall, the fatality rate per 100,000 for African-American males and females was about one and a half times that of white males and females.

The  highly populated areas of Shelby and Davidson Counties by themselves accounted for 38% of all child fatalities, with 29% of the total in Shelby County alone. Four counties reported between 31 and 43 deaths: Knox (4%), Hamilton (4%), Montgomery (4%), and Rutherford (3%). Five counties reported between 15 and 19 deaths: Sumner (2%), Madison (2%), Wilson (2%), Tipton (1%), and Washington (1%).

Accomplishments of District Child Fatality Review Team  Child fatality review teams are active in all judicial districts of the state. The 33 teams had reviewed  1,042 (99%) of the 1,057 fatalities of Tennessee resident children by February 2000. Department of Health team leaders provide administration and coordination of the teams. Some specific examples of team accomplishments are given below.  District 2, Sullivan County  The child fatality review team has worked to resolve discrepancies on birth and death certificates  resulting in more accurate vital records.  The team has worked with local agencies to increase their understanding of the definition of SIDS  and what constitutes a proper investigation. This will help improve the accuracy of SIDS classification.  District 5, Blount County  The child fatality review team submitted a revision of the child fatality review Act, section V,  paragraph A that would allow the local team access to and subpoena power to obtain all medical records as well as medical records maintained by any state, county, or local agency. If passed, this would result in a more thorough review of child deaths.  District 8, Campbell, Claiborne, Fentress, Scott, and Union Counties  The child fatality review team provided information that contributed to a grant of $50,000 being  awarded to Fentress County to improve 127 Bypass to install traffic lights and rumble rows.  District 9, Loudon, Meigs, Morgan, and Roane Counties  The child fatality review team, concerned about the number of deaths due to extra chromosomes, did  a survey of the entire East Tennessee region to determine if this number was abnormal. The survey concluded that there was nothing out of the ordinary.  The team compiled a list of hospitals that offer bereavement and genetic counseling for families who  are affected by a child' death. s  As a result of action taken by the team, the protocol for Group B Strep testing and prophylactic  treatment of pregnant women was updated in a local OBGYN practice. This has the potential to prevent future infant deaths.  District 1901, Montgomery County  The child fatality review team has worked with personnel at the local hospital to improve the  accuracy of information on birth certificates concerning the use by pregnant women of tobacco, alcohol and other chemical substances.  -9-   District 20, Davidson County  Three members of the child fatality review team, Dr. Suzanne Starling, Dr. Bruce Levy and Louis  Martinez, serve on the State SIDS Task Force, which had its first meeting on May 19, 1998.  As a result of the efforts of the team in response to the death of a child, the Davidson County Health  Department and Board of Education worked together to see that special education school bus drivers and aides were given cardiopulmonary resuscitation training. Health department staff will also provide ongoing recertification training for this group.  District 30, Shelby County  This child fatality review team, chaired by Dr. Mark Bugnitz, has the largest number of deaths to  review in the state. The team reviewed 297 deaths that occurred in 1998.  C. Prevention Issues Back to Sleep Education  In an effort to prevent SIDS deaths, there is a nationwide campaign to position babies on their back to  sleep. The position of the infant upon discovery was not known in 56 (78%) of the SIDS fatalities. Of the remaining SIDS fatalities, 9 (11%) were on their stomach (face down) when discovered, 4 (6%) were found on their back, and 3 (4%) were found in other positions.   Safety Belt and Child Safety Seat Usage  In the 85 cases involving vehicles for which the use of a safety belt or child safety seat was  appropriate, safety restraints were present but not used in 51 cases (60%) of the motor vehicle deaths. Safety restraints were used in 24 (28%) of the cases. There was no safety belt or child safety seat present in 1 additional case. For 10 (12%) of the cases this information was not known.  Traffic Safety Violations  The driver was under the influence of alcohol or drugs in 18% of the 103 incidents where the child  fatality involved an automobile, truck, or recreational vehicle. For 36% of the incidents, speeding or reckless driving was involved; 11% involved some other type of driving violation. For the 25 cases involving some other type of vehicle such as a motorcycle, ATV, or go-cart, the vehicle operator was under the influence of alcohol or drugs in 2 incidents, speeding or reckless driving in 2 cases, and 1 case involved some other type of driving violation.  Helmet Usage  The decedents were reported as not wearing a helmet in 7 (64%) of the 11 incidents in which the child  fatality involved a motorcycle, ATV, or bicycle. For 3 (27%) of the cases, helmet usage was unknown.  -10-   Firearms Firearms were involved in the deaths of 48 children. The manner of death was homicide in 19 deaths (40%), suicide in 20 deaths (42%) and accidental in 9 deaths (19%). The type of firearm involved was a handgun in 26 deaths (54%), a shotgun in 10 deaths (21%), and a rifle in 4 deaths (8%).  Water Safety Of the 15 drowning fatalities that occurred in a natural body of water or a swimming pool, 13 (87%) of the victims were not wearing a flotation device. For the remaining 2 cases, a flotation was deemed not applicable. The largest number of drowning fatalities, 10 children (56%), took place at a lake, river, pond, or creek. The remaining, 5 (28%) were in a swimming pool, 1 in a bathtub, 1 in a fish pond, and 1 in a barnyard trough.  Smoke Alarms In 5 (24%) of the fatal fire and burn incidents, the building did not have a smoke alarm. In 8 (38%) incidents an alarm was present, and in 8 (38%) incidents this information was not known or not applicable. For the incidents in which an alarm was present, the alarm sounded in 3 of the cases, did not sound in 4 cases, and was unknown if sounded in 1 case.  Child Abuse Child abuse or neglect was suspected in 29 (3%) of the 1,042 deaths. There was no prior involvement with Child Protective Services in 15 (52%) of these deaths. This reflects the need for early intervention programs for all at-risk families.  Sexually Transmitted Diseases The natural causes category includes the deaths of 8 children related to sexually transmitted diseases. Four children died from AIDS or complications of HIV infection, and their ages were 15 years, 6 years, 3 years, and one infant that was 3 months old. Of the AIDS/HIV cases, 2 occurred in urban counties and 2 occurred in a rural counties. Four children died from sexually transmitted strains of herpes infection; one was 12 years old, and two were infants under one month of age.  E. Recommendations A statewide meeting of all the child fatality review team coordinators was held on October 19, 1999. The team representatives discussed the third year of child fatality review' progress, issues and concerns. s There were numerous recommendations concerning state as well as more local issues. The overarching state recommendations were as follows: 1. The child fatality review teams continue to recommend legislation that includes language that Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) can not be listed on the death certificate as cause of death unless it meets the nationally recognized definition. The definition of SIDS is the sudden death of an infant under one year of age which remains unexplained after thorough case investigation, including performance of a complete autopsy, examination of the death scene, and review of the clinical history.  -11-   2. The teams support legislation that creates a graduated driver's license as an effort to reduce the number of teen drivers who die in vehicular crashes. 3. The child fatality review teams made several recommendations regarding firearms. As a result the Commissioner of Health, Dr. Fredia Wadley, will appoint a firearm safety task force.  F. Additional Concerns 1. The availability of smoke detectors for families below the poverty level. 2. The availability of bicycle helmets for children from families below the poverty level. 3. The need to increase awareness of the issue of suicide by children and youth, the recognition of warning signs and how to get at-risk individuals assistance, among ""helping providers"". 4. The continuing frequency with which vital records, birth and death certificates, are not fully completed with accurate information. A chairperson for a task force on accuracy of vital records was appointed.  -12-   Child Fatalities In Tennessee: 1998 I. Causes and Circumstances of Child Fatalities A. Deaths Due to Natural Causes There were 756 deaths due to natural causes among children in 1998, representing 73% of all child fatalities and constituting the largest manner of death category. Of these, 45% resulted from illness, 45% from prematurity, and 10% from SIDS. Each of these is discussed in more detail in later sections of this report. The greatest number of deaths due to natural causes resulted from illness (342) and prematurity (341) . Of the deaths due to prematurity, 141 were 22 weeks gestation or less and 196 were 23 to 37 weeks gestation. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) accounted for 73 of the remaining deaths due to natural causes, and for one fatality, the manner of death was found to be natural but the specific cause was unable to be determined. [Figure 6]  Figure 6: Number of Deaths Due to Natural Causes by Manner of Death  300  342 196  Premature 2337 weeks Premature 22 weeks or less Other  200  100 141 73  0 Illness Prematurity SIDS  -13-   Significant variation occurred in the gender, age, and ethnicity of the children who died due to natural causes. By gender, 52% of the deaths were males, 48% females. The proportion of males was greater than females in every category except prematurity with gestational age of 22 weeks or less. [Figure 7]  Figure 7: Number of Deaths Due to Natural Causes by Gender  200 184 170 158 150 171 Male Female  100  50 39 34  0 Illness Prematurity SIDS  The preponderance of deaths due to natural causes was among children less than one year of age (581), which represents 77% of all natural deaths. Among these deaths, about one-third of the children survived less than one day after birth (28%), almost one-third survived at least one day but less than one month (28%), with about one-fifth surviving at least one month but less than one year (21%).  -14-   The next largest age category of deaths due to natural causes was for children 1-2 years of age (45 fatalities, or 6%). This was true even for deaths due to illness, where there was more age spread than in the other categories which, by their nature, primarily involve infants.

Cancers and diseases of the respiratory system were the next most frequent. [Table 5] The infectious disease category includes the deaths of 8 children related to sexually transmitted diseases. Four children died from AIDS or complications of HIV infection, and their ages were 15 years, 6 years, 3 years, and one infant was three months old. The HIV deaths occurred in two metropolitan counties and two in a rural county. Four children died from herpes infection, between the ages of 8 to 11 days, and the herpes infection was contracted from the mother during the birth process. The diseases of the respiratory system category includes three deaths from complications of asthma.

Deaths Due to Natural Causes: Prematurity In 1998, 341 premature infants died. Of these, 141 (41%) were 22 weeks or less gestational age, 196 (57%) were between 23 and 37 weeks gestational age, and the gestational weeks were not reported for 4 cases. Together, these fatalities represent 45% of all the deaths due to natural causes and 33% of all child fatalities for the year.  -18-   Table 6 shows the fatalities from prematurity for different age, gender, and ethnic groups.

[Table 6]  The majority of the extreme prematurity fatalities reported a birthweight of less than 1 pound  (69%), and between 1 and 2 pounds for 28% of the cases, and more than 2 pounds for 2% of these cases. The birth weight was not reported for 2% of the cases. For the 196 fatalities due to prematurity with gestational age between 23 and 37 weeks:  66 (34%) died immediately after birth or within 24 hours, 59 (30%) died between 1 and 6  days after birth, 43 (22%) died between 7 and 28 days after birth, and 28 infants (14%) lived more than 28 days. [Table 6]  The majority of the prematurity fatalities between 23-37 weeks of gestation reported a  birthweight between 1 and 2 pounds (65%). Birthweight was less than 1 pound for 7% of these cases, between 2 and 3 pounds for 17%, between 3 and 5 pounds for 6%, and more than 5 pounds for 4% of these cases.

Deaths Due to Natural Causes: SIDS In 1998, 73 child deaths were reported as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). This represents 10% of the deaths due to natural causes and 7% of all child fatalities for the year. Table 8 shows the SIDS fatalities for different age, gender, and ethnic groups. All of the SIDS fatalities were children less than one year old, 44% were 90 days or younger, and the majority (56%) were more than 90 days old. Of the 73 SIDS fatalities, 9 (12%) were on their stomach (face down) when discovered, 4 (6%) were found on their back, 2 (3%) were found on their side, and 1 in some other position. For the remaining cases, the position on discovery was not known for 56 (77%) of the fatalities, and for 1 case this information was not reported.

Prior involvement of Child Protective Services was reported for 12 cases (16%).  -21-   B. Deaths Due to Unintentional Injury Unintentional injury deaths are those for which the manner of death was determined to be accidental by the CFRT. There were 202 unintentional injury fatalities among children in 1998, representing 19% of all child fatalities. The greatest number of unintentional injury deaths, by far, resulted from vehicular crashes 123 (61%). Fire or burns 21 (10%), drowning 18 (9%), suffocation 16 (8%), and firearms 9 (4%), were the next most frequent causes of unintentional injury deaths. [Figure 10]  Figure 10: Number of Unintentional Injury Deaths by Cause  123 120  100  80  60  40  20 9  18  21 16 11 4  0 Firearm Drowning Vehicular Suffocation Fire/Burn Poison/Overdose Other  -22-   Significant variation occurred in the gender, age, and ethnicity of the children who died due to unintentional injury. By gender, 65% of the unintentional injury fatalities were males, with the majority of these male fatalities being due to vehicular accidents (56%). Females accounted for 35% of the unintentional fatalities, with 69% of the female accidental deaths being due to vehicular incidents. Overall, the proportion of males was greater than females in every category of unintentional injury deaths.

In the other 2 incidents, the types of vehicles were a bicycle and a train [Table 10]. Four of the child pedestrian fatalities (20%) involved a driver impaired by alcohol or drugs, and none involved speeding or reckless driving or other violations. Among the 103 vehicle-related fatalities involving an automobile, truck, or recreational vehicle, the fatally injured child was a passenger in 53% of the incidents, the driver in 29%, and a pedestrian in 18%. When the fatally injured child was a passenger, the age of the driver was 18 or under in 31% of the incidents, age 19-24 in 15%, age 25 or over in 31%, and unknown in 24%. For the 98 incidents in which the fatally injured child was an occupant (driver or passenger) of an automobile, truck, or recreational vehicle, a safety belt (or child safety seat, when applicable) was present but not used in 60% of the incidents. For 12% of the cases, this information was not known. The road conditions were judged normal in 64% of the incidents, wet in 18%, some other condition in 6% of the cases, and the conditions were unknown in 13% of the incidents. Eleven percent involved a driver under the influence of alcohol or drugs. For 37% of the incidents, speeding or reckless driving was involved and 10% involved some other type of driving violation. For the five fatalities involving some other type of vehicle, the vehicle operator was under the influence of alcohol or drugs in two cases, speeding or reckless driving in two cases, and some other type of violation in one case. For the 11 incidents in which the child fatality involved a motorcycle, ATV, or bicycle, 64% of the decedents were not wearing a helmet. In 27% of the incidents, this information was not known. One incident occurred in which a child was hit by a train while standing on the railroad tracks.  -27-   2. Unintentional Injury Deaths: Firearms In 1998, nine children died in firearm accidents. This represents 4% of the unintentional injury deaths and 1% of all child fatalities for the year. Table 11 shows the unintentional firearm fatalities for different age, gender, and ethnic groups.

In five of these nine incidents, some other person handled the firearm. For the five incidents in which another person handled the firearm, that person' age was between 12 and s 16 years old in two of the incidents, over 18 in two incidents, and the age was unknown in one of these incidents. A handgun was involved in six of the unintentional firearm fatalities, a shotgun in three. In four of the incidents, the child involved was playing with the firearm, in one incident the gun was being used for hunting, in one incident the gun was being unloaded, and in one case the decedent was playing Russian roulette with gang members. In the remaining two incidents, the use of the gun was either unknown or not reported.  -28-   3. Unintentional Injury Deaths: Drowning In 1998, 18 children died from accidental drowning. This accounted for 9% of all unintentional injury deaths and 2% of all child fatalities for the year. Table 12 shows the drowning fatalities for different age, gender, and ethnic groups.

Unintentional Injury Deaths: Other There were 11 other cases of unintentional injury fatalities that did not fall into any of the categories described above. Five deaths were due to trauma to the body: a two-year-old was dragged and crushed by a wagon and team of gentle farm horses; a five-year-old died due to dog bites; a three-year-old injured the head, chest, and abdomen in a fall; a nine-year-old died when a trailer dislodged and fell; and a fourteenyear-old was crushed by several hundred pounds of falling dirt. Four of these deaths were due to head trauma: a six-month-old fell from a couch and hit its head on a table, a nine-year-old fell from a horse and was dragged, a fifteen-year-old fell in a cave, and a seventeen-year-old was injured playing ball. The death of a two-year-old resulted from hyperthermia after the child climbed into a car alone. One infant died due to transection of umbilical cord during a home birth.  -32-   C. Violence Related Deaths Violence related deaths are those for which the manner of death was determined by the CFRT to be either suicide or homicide. There were 64 violence related fatalities among children in 1998, representing 6% of all child fatalities. Of these, 27 (42%) were suicides and 37 (58%) were homicides. [Figure 14] The number of violence related deaths varied by gender, age, and ethnicity. Of the 64 fatalities, 45 (70%) were males and 19 (30%) were females. The largest number of fatalities was for age group 16-17 (31 children; 48%). There were 12 children age 14-15 (19%) and 4 children (6%) less than one year of age. By ethnicity, 40 (63%) of the violence related fatalities were white, 22 (34%) were African-American, and 2 children were Hispanic.

For example, refugees from Cambodia were exposed to          trauma before migrating to the United States because of persecution by          the Khmer Rouge Communists under Pol Pot. During the four years of Pol          Pot’s regime (1975–1979), between 1 and 3 million of the 7          million people in Cambodia died through starvation, disease, or mass executions.          This national trauma, as well as the stressors associated with relocation,          including English language difficulties and cultural conflicts, continues          to affect the emotional health of many Cambodian refugees and other immigrants.                 Somatization          Another important factor related to mental health is culture. Culture shapes          the expression and recognition of psychiatric problems. Western culture          makes a distinction between the mind and body, but many Asian cultures          do not (Lin, 1996). Therefore, it has long been hypothesized that Asians          express more somatic symptoms of distress than white Americans. The influence          of the teachings and philosophies of a Confucian, collectivist tradition          discourages open displays of emotions, in order to maintain social and          familial harmony or to avoid exposure of personal weakness. Mental illness          is highly stigmatizing in many Asian cultures. In these societies, mental          illness reflects poorly on one’s family lineage and can influence          others’ beliefs about how suitable someone is for marriage if he          or she comes from a family with a history of mental illness. Thus, either          consciously or unconsciously, Asians are thought to deny the experience          and expression of emotions. These factors make it more acceptable for          psycho-logical distress to be expressed through the body rather than the          mind (Tseng, 1975; Kleinman, 1977; Nguyen, 1982; Gaw, 1993; Chun et al.,          1996). It has been found that Chinese Americans are more likely to exhibit          somatic complaints of depression than are African Americans or whites          (Chang, 1985), and Chinese Americans with mood disorders exhibit more          somatic symptoms than do white Americans (Hsu & Folstein, 1997).          Hsu and Folstein (1997) and Leff (1988) also suggest that psychological expression          of distress is a relatively recent Western phenomenon, and that physical          expression of psychological distress is normal in many cultures. Others          have argued that somatization is often under the control of display rules          that dictate when, where, and what symptoms are shown (Cheung, 1982).          In this view, it is not so much that Chinese suppress or repress affective          symptoms, but that the context of the situation influences what is presented.          Chinese may display somatic symptoms to mental health workers but show          depressive symptoms to others. Mental health professionals who rely solely          on the standard psychiatric diagnoses used in the United States may not          identify these somatic expressions of distress.          Key Issues for Understanding the Research          Methodology          The history of AA/PI groups reveals the tremendous diversity within the population.          Unfortunately, in the past, research studies have typically classified          Asian and Pacific Islander Americans as belonging to a homogenous ethnic          category. Chapter 1 outlined some of the serious methodological problems          (e.g., the high cost of screening rare populations) that partially explain          why AA/PIs are often lumped together or into an “other” category.          Despite the practical basis for creating a single racial designation for          AA/PIs, using it has had real scientific and policy con-sequences. One          consequence, as demonstrated later in this chapter, is that very little          is known about the rates of mental illness, access to care, quality of          care, and outcomes of treatment for different groups of Asian Americans          and Pacific Islanders. The AA/PI category is a social and political convenience          because the use of the term allows researchers, service providers, and          policymakers to easily describe and discuss groups who seemingly share          similar backgrounds. Unfortunately, this classification masks the social,          cultural, and psychological variations that exist among AA/PI ethnic groups          and constrains analyses of the interethnic differences in mental illness,          help-seeking, and service use. The conclusions drawn from analyses using          AA/PIs as a single racial category may be substantively different than          ones made when specific AA/PI ethnic groups are examined (Uehara et al.,          1994).          A second consequence of using a single ethnic category in research analyses is          that it can lead to the conclusion that AA/PIs are a model minority. On          average, AA/PIs have relatively high levels of educational, occupational,          and economic achievement, and low rates of certain health problems. A          simple interpretation of these types of data has resulted in portrayals          of AA/PIs as extraordinarily successful, which justifies the lack of research          attention and resources allocated to this population. However, recognition          of the diverse ethnic groups that comprise the AA/PI category helps to          cast doubt on the model minority image. It should be noted that occasionally          research on an aggregate group (e.g., Asian Americans) might be appropriate,          particularly when the characteristic under observation is common to many          Asian American groups. Nevertheless, care must be exercised to avoid stereotyping          this population. The needs of specific AA/PI ethnic groups must be considered          in order to fully understand the mental health of Asian Americans and          Pacific Islanders.          Diagnosis          Establishing the rates of psychiatric disorders among AA/PIs is important in          determining the need for mental health care in this population. As mentioned          earlier, a common standard in setting the criteria for different mental          disorders is the American Psychiatric Association’s (APA)  Diagnostic          and Statistical Manual  of Mental Disorders  (1994). A critical          issue is whether or not AA/PIs manifest symptoms similar to those found          in Western societies as defined by the DSM–IV. Marsella and colleagues          (1985) note that there is a tendency in the mental health field to overlook          cultural variations in the expression of mental disorder when developing          nosological categories. Groups vary in how they define such constructs          as “distress,” “normality,” and “abnormality.”          These variations affect definitions of mental health and mental illness,          expressions of psychopathology, and coping mechanisms (Marsella, 1982).                 In addition, ethnic and cultural groups may have unique ways of expressing distress.          As discussed later, neurasthenia, a condition often characterized by fatigue,          weakness, poor concentration, memory loss, irritability, aches and pains,          and sleep disturbances, is recognized in China. It is an official category          in the International Classification of Diseases (Version 10) but not in          the DSM–IV. Neurasthenia is a common diagnosis in China (Yamamoto,          1992), although it is not an official category in the DSM–IV. It          is sometimes classified as undifferentiated somatoform disorder (if symptoms          last at least six months) or as a rheumatological disorder. Some of the          symptoms found in neurasthenia (loss of energy, inability to concentrate,          sleep disturbances, etc.) overlap with those in depressive disorders.          However, in neurasthenia, the somatic symptoms rather than depressed moods          are critical, and any depressive symptoms are not sufficiently persistent          and severe to warrant a diagnosis of a mood disorder.          Acculturation          An important factor in understanding the symptom expression, rates of illness,          and use of services by immigrants and refugees is their  acculturation ,          or adoption of the worldviews and living patterns of a new culture. Asian          Americans differ in how they are integrated with-in the dominant U.S.          culture, how they remain tied to the cultures of their ethnic origins,          or how they are able to negotiate life in multiple cultures. Although          many advances have been made in measuring acculturation, this area of          research still has unresolved conceptual and methodological problems.          Many factors affect the way and extent to which immigrants become involved          in a new culture and remain connected with their earlier heritage. For          example, age at time of immigration, presence of similar immigrants, and          interaction with others from the new environment all influence adaptation.          The influence of acculturation on mental health has not been clearly identified,          in part because of problems with measuring acculturation. Nonetheless,          the level of exposure to and involvement in U.S. culture is important          when examining mental health factors for Asian Americans.          Mental Disorders          Adults          Less is known about the rates of psychiatric disorders using DSM categories for          AA/PIs than for most of the other major ethnic groups. Even when AA/PIs          are included as part of the sample of large-scale studies, it is not often          possible to make estimates of mental disorders for this population. Two          major studies, the Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) study and the National          Comorbidity Study (NCS), examined the need for mental health care in the          U.S. population. In the 1980s, researchers who were conducting the Epidemiologic          Catchment Area study (Regier et al., 1993) included residents of Baltimore,          St. Louis, Durham, Los Angeles, and New Haven in their sample. English-speaking          Asian Americans, who were classified in a single ethnic category, comprised          less than 2 percent of the total sample ( N =  242). Because          of the limited sample size and the unclear composition of the AA/PI category,          accurate conclusions could not be drawn about this population’s          need for mental health care (Zhang & Snowden, 1999).          While the ECA study was limited to samples from five U.S. cities, the NCS (Kessler          et al., 1994) estimated the rates of psychiatric disorders in a representative          sample of the entire U.S. population. Just as in the ECA study, the NCS          included a small sample of English-speaking Asian Americans and classified          all ethnic groups into a single AA/PI category. Again, the group of Asian          American respondents in the NCS was small, extremely diverse, and not          representative of any particular Asian American subgroup.          The Chinese American Psychiatric Epidemiological Study (CAPES), was a large-scale          investigation of the prevalence of selected disorders using DSM–IIIR          (APA, 1987) criteria. This study, conducted in 1993 and 1994, examined          rates of depression among more than 1,700 Chinese Americans in Los Angeles          County (Sue et al., 1995; Takeuchi et al., 1998). The CAPES sample was          comprised predominantly of Chinese immigrants; 90 per-cent of the sample          was born outside the United States. Researchers conducted interviews in          Cantonese, Mandarin, and English, and they used a multistage sampling          procedure to select respondents. CAPES was similar in some ways to the          ECA and NCS. Like the ECA, CAPES used one geographic site rather than          a national sample. To measure depression, CAPES used the Composite International          Diagnostic Interview Schedule—the University of Michigan version          (UM–CIDI)—which is similar to the diagnostic instrument used          in the NCS.          CAPES results showed that Chinese Americans had moderate levels of depressive          disorders (Table 5–1). About 7 percent of the respondents reported          experiencing depression in their lifetimes, and a little over 3 percent          had been depressed during the past year. These rates were lower than those          found in the NCS (Kessler et al., 1994). On the other hand, the rate for          dysthymia more nearly matched the NCS estimates. It should be noted that          the rates of lifetime and 12-month depression and dysthymia were very          similar to the prevalence rates found in the Los Angeles site for the          ECA. The implications of these findings are reviewed at the end of the          discussion of other studies using symptom scales.          No study has addressed the rates of mental disorders for Pacific Islander American          ethnic groups.                  Table 5-1 compares data from the Chinese American Psychiatric Epidemiological          Study and the National Comorbidity Survey for the 12-month and lifetime          prevalence of Major Depression and Dysthymia among Chinese Americans and          the general population.          Children and Youth          Very little is known about the mental health needs of the diverse populations          of Asian American and Pacific Islander children and adolescents. No large          studies documenting rates of psychiatric disorders in these youth have          been conducted. However, several studies of symptoms of emotional distress          have been conducted in small group samples of Asian American and Pacific          Islander youth. Most of these studies find few differences between Asian          American and Pacific Islander youth and white youth. For example, Filipino          youth (Edman et al., 1998) and Hawaiian youth (Makini et al., 1996) attending          high schools in Hawaii were found to have rates of depressive symptoms          similar to those of white youth in the same schools. On the other hand,          Chinese immigrant students have reported high rates of anxiety (Sue &          Zane, 1985).          Older Adults          Little information is available on the prevalence of psychiatric disorders among          older Asian Americans. Yamamoto and colleagues (1994) found a relatively          low lifetime prevalence of most psychiatric disorders according to DSM–III          (APA, 1980) criteria among a sample ( N =  100) of older Koreans          drawn from the Korean Senior Citizens Association in Los Angeles (Yamamoto          et al., 1994). Researchers also compared older Koreans in Los Angeles          with community epidemiological studies conducted in Korea. The prevalence          of almost all psychiatric disorders was similar for older Koreans in Los          Angeles and those in Korea (Yamamoto et al., 1994).          Four other studies have examined the psychological well-being of older Asian          Americans. These studies are weak from a methodological standpoint because          they involve small, non-random samples and use general measures of distress          rather than measures of psychiatric disorders. Three studies used the          translated version of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). A convenience          sample of Japanese American older adults in Los Angeles ( N =  86)          was found to be relatively healthy and not depressed (Iwamasa et al.,          1998). In a sample of older Chinese American adults in Minneapolis–St.          Paul ( N =  45) between the ages of 59 and 89 years, 20 percent were          found to have significant depressive symptoms. A study of older, community-dwelling          Chinese immigrants ( N =  50) in a Northeast urban area revealed          that 18 per-cent of respondents were mildly to severely depressed (Mui,          1996). These rates are similar to those found in other community samples          of older people. Raskin and colleagues (1992) compared Chinese and white          Americans between the ages of 60 and 99 from senior citizen housing complexes,          senior citizen centers, senior citizen clubs at churches, and other community          locations. Chinese Americans reported somatic psychiatric distress similar          to what their white American counter-parts reported. Finally, White and          colleagues (1996) found a 9 percent prevalence for dementia among Japanese          American men living in institutions or in the community in Honolulu, a          rate lower than that for Japanese men in Japan, but similar to that for          other American men in their age group.          In sum, researchers must be cautious about generalizations based on the limited          findings on the mental health of older Asian Americans. Subjects for these          studies are often recruited through Asian American senior organizations;          the extent to which these findings can be generalized to less active older          adults is limited. However, these results do not reveal high rates of          psychopathology among older Asian adults.          Mental Health Problems          Symptoms          Much more is known about mental health problems measured by symptom scales as          opposed to DSM criteria. In these studies, AA/PIs do appear to have an          increased risk for symptoms of depression. Diagnoses of psychiatric disorders          rely both on the presence of symptoms and on additional strict guidelines          about the intensity and duration of symptoms. In studies of depressive          symptoms, individuals are often asked to indicate whether or not they          have specific depressive symptoms and how many days in the past week they          experienced these symptoms. In several studies, Chinese Americans, Japanese          Americans, Filipino Americans, and Korean Americans in Seattle (Kuo, 1984;          Kuo & Tsai, 1986), Korean immigrants in Chicago (Hurh & Kim, 1990),          and Chinese Americans in San Francisco (Ying, 1988) reported more depressive          symptoms than did whites in those cities. One interpretation of the findings          suggests that AA/PIs show high rates of depression, or simply have more          symptoms but not necessarily higher rates of depression. Few studies exist          on the mental health needs of other large ethnic groups such as Indian,          Hmong, and Pacific Islander Americans.          Culture-Bound Syndromes          Even if Asian Americans are not at high risk for a few of the psychiatric disorders          that are common in the United States, they may experience so-called culture-bound          syndromes (APA, 1994). Two such syndromes are neurasthenia and  hwa-byung .                 As described earlier, Chinese societies recognize a disorder called neurasthenia.          In a study of Chinese Americans in Los Angeles, Zheng and his colleagues          (1997) found that nearly 7 percent of a random sample of respondents reported          that they had experienced neurasthenia. The neurasthenic symptoms often          occurred in the absence of symptoms of other disorders, which raises doubt          that neurasthenia is simply another disorder (e.g., depression) in disguise.          Furthermore, more than half of those with this syndrome did not have a          concomitant Western psychiatric diagnosis from the DSM–III–R.          Thus, although Chinese Americans are likely to experience neurasthenia,          mental health professionals using the standard U.S. diagnostic system          may not identify their need for mental health care.          Koreans may experience  hwa-byung , a culture-bound disorder with both somatic          and psychological symptoms.  Hwa-byung , or “suppressed anger          syndrome,” is characterized by sensations of constriction in the          chest, palpitations, sensations of heat, flushing, headache, dysphoria,          anxiety, irritability, and problems with concentration (Lin, 1983; Prince,          1989). A community survey in Los Angeles found that 12 percent of Korean          Americans (total  N =  109), the majority of whom were recent immigrants,          suffered from this disorder (Lin, 1983; Lin et al., 1992); this rate is          higher than that found in Korea (4%) (Min, 1990).          Suicide          Little research is available to shed light on the mental health needs of Asian          Americans, but some information may be obtained by looking at suicide          rates (Table 5-2). It is thought that Asian Americans are generally less          likely to commit suicide than whites. A study by Lester (1994) compared          suicide rates (per 100,000 per year) in the United States for various          groups. Chinese (8.3), Japanese (9.1), and Filipino (3.5) Americans had          lower suicide rates than whites (12.8). However, other sub-groups of Asian          Americans and Pacific Islanders may be at higher risk for suicide. For          example, Native Hawaiian adolescents have a higher risk of suicide than          other adolescents in Hawaii.          Concerns have been raised regarding high rates of suicide among young women who          immigrate to the United States from the Indian subcontinent (Patel &          Gaw, 1996) and among Micronesian adolescents (Rubinstein, 1983), but these          groups have not been well studied. Finally, older Asian American women          have the highest suicide rate of all women over the age of 65 in the United          States (DHHS, 1999). Clearly, more information is needed on suicide among          subgroups of Asian Americans.                      Table 5-2 provides suicide rates for Asian Americans, white Americans,          Native Hawaiian adolescents and non-native Hawaiian adolescents in Hawaii.                 High-Need Populations          Refugees          The mental health needs of a population may be indicated by rates of mental disorders          in the population as a whole, or by the existence of smaller subpopulations          that have a particularly high need for mental health care. The relationship          between poverty, poor health, and mental health is very consistent in          the mental health literature. Given the relative economic status of Asian          Americans and Pacific Islanders, it is not surprising that they are not          present in large numbers among the Nation’s homeless (U.S. Census          Bureau, 1996). Furthermore, they make up less than 1 percent of the national          incarcerated population (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 1999). Although          there are inadequate data to draw conclusions about how often Asian American          and Pacific Islander children are exposed to violence, this exposure is          often related to socioeconomic deprivation. Most studies indicate that          Asian Americans are less likely to have substance abuse problems than          are other Americans (Makimoto, 1998). In sum, Asian Americans and Pacific          Islanders are not heavily represented in many of the groups known to have          high need for mental health care. However, many do experience difficulties,          such as the lack of English proficiency, acculturative stress, prejudice,          discrimination, and racial hate crimes, which place them at risk for emotional          and behavioral problems. Southeast Asian refugees, in particular, are          considered to be at high risk.          Many Southeast Asian refugees are at risk for post-traumatic stress disorder          (PTSD) associated with the trauma they experienced before they immigrated          to the United States. Refugees who fled Vietnam after the fall of Saigon          in 1975 were mainly well-educated Vietnamese who were often able to speak          some English and prosper financially. Although subsequent Vietnamese refugees          were less educated and less financially secure, they were able to join          established communities of other Vietnamese in the United States. Cambodians          and Laotians became the second wave of refugees from Indochina. The Cambodians          were survivors of Pol Pot’s holocaust of killing fields. Several          groups of Laotians, including the Mien and Hmong, had cooperated with          American forces and left Laos after the war from fear of retribution.          One-third of the Laotian population had been killed during the war, and          many others fled to escape the devastation.          Studies document high rates of mental disorders among these refugees. A large          community sample of Southeast Asian refugees in the United States (Chung          & Kagawa-Singer, 1993) found that premigration trauma events and refugee          camp experiences were significant predictors of psychological distress          even five years or more after migration. Significant subgroup differences          were also found. Cambodians reported the highest levels of distress, Laotians          were next, then Vietnamese. Studies of Southeast Asian refugees receiving          mental health care uniformly find high rates of PTSD. One study found          70 percent met diagnostic criterion for the disorder, with Mien from the          highlands of Laos and Cambodians having the highest rates (Kinzie et al.,          1990; Carlson & Rosser-Hogan, 1991; Moore & Boehnlein, 1991).                 Another study examined the mental health of 404 Southeast Asian refugees during          an initial clinical evaluation of patients seen for psychiatric assessment          at a Southeast Asian mental health clinic in Minnesota. The sample was          Hmong, Laotian, Cambodian, and Vietnamese. Clinical diagnoses were made          according to DSM–III by two psychiatrists, who also used information          from a symptom checklist. In this sample, 73 per-cent had major depression,          14 percent had post-traumatic stress disorder, and 6 percent had anxiety          and somatoform disorders (Kroll et al., 1989). Blair (2000) found that          a random, community sample of Cambodian adults ( N = 124) had high          rates of trauma-related stress and depression. This study, which used          a standard diagnostic interview, found that 45 percent had PTSD, and 81          per-cent experienced five or more symptoms. Furthermore, 51 percent suffered          from depression. Most of these individuals (85%) had experienced horrible          traumas prior to immigrating to the United States, including starvation,          torture, and losing family members to the war. On aver-age, individuals          in the sample experienced 20 war traumas (Blair, 2000). Similarly, 168          adults, recruited from a community of resettled Cambodian refugees in          Massachusetts, were interviewed for a study of trauma, physical and emotional          health, and functioning. Of the 161 participants who had ever had children,          70 parents (43%) reported the death of between 1 and 6 of their children.          Child loss was positively associated with health-related concerns, a variety          of somatic symptoms, and culture-bound conditions of emotional distress          such as “a deep worrying sadness not visible to others” (Caspi          et al., 1998).          Some subgroups of Vietnamese refugees may also be at high risk for mental health          problems. Hinton and colleagues (1997) compared Vietnamese and Chinese          refugees from Vietnam 6 months after their arrival in the United States          and 12 to 18 months later. The ethnic Vietnamese had higher depression          at the second assessment than did the Chinese immigrants.          Two studies have found high rates of distress among refugee youth. Cambodian          high school students had symptoms of PTSD and mild, but prolonged, depressive          symptoms (Kinzie et al. 1986). Researchers also have noted high levels          of anxiety among unaccompanied minors, adolescents, and young adult refugees          from Vietnam (Felsman et al., 1990). Likewise, in a study of Cambodian          adolescents who survived Pol Pot’s concentration camps, Kinzie and          colleagues (1989) found that nearly half suffered from PTSD, and 41 percent          experienced depression approximately 10 years after this traumatic period.          Clearly, because many Southeast Asian refugees experienced significant          trauma prior to immigration, rates of PTSD and depression are extraordinarily          high among both adult and youth refugees.          Researchers conducting the next generation of studies need not only to derive          accurate estimates of psychopathology among AA/PIs, but also to identify          the specific ways that social and cultural factors influence the expression          of mental disorders among AA/PIs. The results might then prove or disprove          several of the general hypotheses that are currently made about the prevalence          of mental disorders among Asian Americans.                             Box 5–1:  The Plight of Southeast Asian Refugees           A Khmer woman (mid-40’s)              Because of premigration traumas and the adjustment to relocation            in the United States, many Southeast Asian refugees are experiencing            great stress. The following excerpts were elicited in a mental health            interview of a mid-40-year-old, Khmer woman from Cambodia by Rumbaut            (1985).         “I lost my husband, I lost my country, I lost every property/fortune            we owned. And coming over here, I can’t learn to speak English            and the way of life here is different; my mother and oldest son are            very sick; I feel crippled, I can do nothing, I can’t control            what’s going on. I don’t know what I’m going to do            once my public assistance expires. I may feel safe in a way— there            is no war here, no Communist to kill or to torture you—but deep            down inside me, I still don’t feel safe or secure. I feel scared.            I get scared so easily.” (p. 475)                                    The first hypothesis suggests that rates of disorders will be high because          many Asian Americans are immigrants who undergo difficult transitions          in their adjustment to American society, and many have experienced prejudice,          discrimination, and major trauma in their homelands. Indeed, as reported          earlier, studies have found that some Asian American ethnic groups do          have higher symptom scores than whites. A second hypothesis argues that          the rates of mood disorders will be low because Asian Americans, like          Asians in other countries, are likely to express their problems in behavioral          or somatic terms rather than in emotional terms. Available evidence, for          example, does suggest that the rates of mood disorders are low in Taiwan,          Hong Kong, and China (Hwu et al., 1989). A third hypothesis maintains          that the rates of mental disorders will be lowest for recent immigrants          and highest for native-born residents. Low rates of mental disorders have          been found among recent Mexican immigrants, for whom culture may be protective          against mental health problems at first; but these low rates erode over          time as Mexican immigrants acculturate. With Asian Americans, however,          the preliminary evidence suggests that acculturation is directly related          to well-being, at least in the case of Asian American students (Abe &          Zane, 1990; Sue et al., 1996)                                                         Index                                        Next                                                                         Home    |           Contact Us    |           About Us    |           Awards    |           Privacy Statement    |           Site Map    |        E-mail This Page                               U.S. Department of  Health & Human Services        Office of the Surgeon General        Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration         For other mental health information visit  http://www.mentalhealth.samhsa.gov/ .

GX067-79-14304975	"Public Health News         May 4, 2000         New Mural Promotes ""Hope and Help"" for Traumatic Brain Injury        Prevention and Care                               SEATTLE, WASHINGTON - The Brain Injury Association of Washington, Public Health, and the Adler Giersch law firm unveiled a new wall mural today in the Denny Regrade area, designed to raise awareness about care and prevention of traumatic brain injury. Famed, local artist David Heck, best known as the painter of the Tower Records mural wall, painted the mural.                                                                      The ""Hope and Help"" Mural by local artist, David Heck                                   The colorful mural, entitled ""Hope and Help"", is located at 333 Taylor Avenue North in Seattle on the southern, exterior wall of the building. It is a dramatic and incisive representation of the sudden transformation that occurs when one suffers a brain injury.         ""This mural's powerful images serve as a reminder to all of us about the importance of preventing brain injuries as well as the hope for good care and support of those who have already sustained them"", said Richard Wilson, Executive Director of the Brain Injury Association of Washington.         Every 15 seconds, someone in the United States sustains a brain injury, with 50,000 people dying each year from this kind of trauma. Moreover, approximately 5.3 million Americans currently live with disabilities resulting from brain injury.          The consequences of brain injuries include short- and/or long-term memory loss, trouble processing information or concentrating, impaired judgment, seizures, muscle spacicity, loss of senses (e.g., vision, smell), and sleep problems, among many others.         For those with brain injury, simple tasks often are no longer simple. Phone numbers, recipes, directions that once sprung readily to mind can no longer be easily recalled.         The risk of traumatic brain injury is highest among adolescents, young adults and those over age 75 years. After one brain injury, the risk for second and third such injuries increases dramatically, often resulting in even more serious consequences including death.         ""The risk of brain injuries can be dramatically reduced by following simple, proven strategies such as wearing helmets and seatbelts and avoiding alcohol use before driving,"" said Dr. Alonzo Plough, Director of Public Health - Seattle & King County.         Some common sense strategies can significantly reduce the risk of brain injury for children and adults alike including:                  Wear a helmet when riding bicycles or motorcycles, skateboarding, and skating;                   Avoid alcohol use before or during driving or water recreation (e.g., swimming);                   Wear seat belts when driving and appropriately secure children in the vehicle;                   Do not keep hand guns at home; or, if you do keep them with  safety locks ; and,                   Modify living environments of seniors to reduce the chance of falls.

Tobacco consumption    Tobacco is smoked in the form of bidis, or rolled in maize leaves; it is also chewed and used as snuff.       Mortality from Tobacco Use    Chronic lung disease is reported to be an important cause of morbidity and mortality in Bhutan. However, cases of lung cancer are rare. Almost all the ischaemic heart disease patients attending hospitals are found to be smokers.       Tobacco Control Measures    There is no known national committee on smoking or health, however in the mid 1990s, discussions began about government legislation on the sale and consumption of tobacco products. There is also increasing governmnent efforts to inform people about the health hazards of tobacco use.     Health education  In Bhutan, smoking is generally not approved of due to religious reasons, and is frowned upon by the elders and religious leaders. Physicians also counsel their patients not to smoke, but there is still a lack of adequate information to the population on the hazards of smoking ""No Smoking Day"" is held every year in Bhutan to coincide with WHO's World No Tobacco Day.

In 1992, 100 tonnes of unmanufactured tobacco along with 17 million cigarettes were imported. Import costs of all tobacco products amounted to US$ 922 000 in 1990, more than 3 times the amount spent in 1985.    Industry   About 336 people were engaged full-time in tobacco manufacturing in 1990.       Tobacco consumption    Almost all tobacco consumed in Mauritius is in the form of cigarettes. In the 1980s and continuing into the early 1990s, annual adult per capita consumption has averaged around 1,800 cigarettes.                               Consumption of Manufactured Cigarettes                                                    Annual average per adult (15+)                                1970-72                    1,310                                1980-82                    1,940                                1990-92                    1,830                 Tar/Nicotine/Filters  In 1994, 64% of the manufactured cigarettes in Mauritius were filter-tipped.       Prevalence    In 1987, smoking prevalence was 58.2 (M) and 6.9% (F). Following a 5 years intervention programme, the prevalence in 1992 had decreased to 47.2% (M) and 3.7% (F).    Tobacco use among sub-groups  Survey data from 1988 indicated that 18% of male physicians smoked, while no female physicians did so. In 1993, smoking prevalence among male nurses was 22% and 0% for female nurses. In 1993, 92.2% of male primary school teachers, and 1.6% of female teachers smoked. The majority of Mauritians who smoke started smoking between the ages of 13-18 years.       Tobacco Control Measures    Control on Tobacco Products   Since 1989, sales of cigarettes to minors (less than 18) have been banned. Since 1992, tobacco advertisements on television and radio are banned as well as tobacco advertisements in school magazines or papers that target youth. From the same year there is a new government warning on cigarette packets (""Smoking causes cancer, bronchitis and heart disease""). It is illegal to import chewing tobacco.    Protection for non-smokers  Smoking is banned in public transport, healthcare facilities, schools and cinemas. In addition, smoking is prohibited in elevators, police stations, post offices, libraries, sports halls and gymnasia, pharmacies, museums and nurseries.    Health Education   Health Education Programmes against tobacco use are carried out both in schools and health facilities. In 1987, a 5 year intervention programme was initiated, with anti-smoking messages in the media, as well as talks to targeted high risk groups.       Previous Country  |  Africa  |  Next Country"

Why are so many people homeless?   Who is homeless?   Why are so many people with serious mental illnesses homeless?   What do we know about people with serious mental illnesses who are homeless?   How can we end homelessness for people with serious mental illnesses?      How many people are homeless?    In 1996, an estimated 637,000 adults were homeless in any given week. In the same year, an estimated 2.1 million adults were homeless over the course of a year. These numbers increase dramatically when children are included, to 842,000 and 3.5 million, respectively. Over a 5-year period, about 2 to 3 percent of the U.S. population (5 to 8 million people) will experience at least one night of homelessness. For the great majority of these people, the experience is short and often caused by a natural disaster, house fire, or community evacuation.  A much smaller group, perhaps as many as 500,000 people, has greater difficulty ending homelessness. One researcher who examined a sample of homeless persons over a 2-year period found:       Most, or about 80 percent, exit from homelessness within 2 or 3 weeks. They often have more personal, social, and economic resources to draw from than people who are homeless for longer periods of time.     About 10 percent are homeless for up to 2 months, with housing availability and affordability adding to the time they are homeless.    Another 10 percent are homeless on a chronic, protracted basis, for as long as 7 or 8 months in a 2-year period. Disabilities associated with mental illnesses and substance use are common. On any given night, this group of homeless persons can account for up to 50 percent of those seeking emergency shelter.      back to top    Why are so many people homeless?    The reasons that people become homeless are as varied and complex as the individuals themselves. Several  structural factors  contribute greatly to homelessness:       Poverty . In 1996, the median monthly income for people who were homeless was $300, which is only 44 percent of the Federal poverty level for a single adult. Losses in the numbers of manufacturing and industrial jobs, combined with an 18 percent decline in the real value of the minimum wage between 1979 and 1997, have left significant numbers of people without a livable income.    Housing . The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development estimates that there are 5 million households in the U.S. with incomes below 50 percent of the local median that pay more than half of their income for rent or that live in severely substandard housing. This is made worse by a 5 percent decline since 1991 in the number of housing units affordable to extremely low-income households, a loss of more than 370,000 units. Federal rental assistance has not been able to bridge the gap; the average wait for Section 8 rental assistance is now 28 months.    Disability . People with disabilities who are unable to work and must rely on entitlements such as Supplemental Security Income (SSI) can find it virtually impossible to find affordable housing. In 2000, the federal SSI benefit was $512 per month, which would not cover the cost of an efficiency or one-bedroom apartment in any major housing market in the country.      There are also several individual factors that may increase a person's risk for becoming homeless and remaining homeless for a longer period of time:       Untreated mental illness  can cause individuals to become paranoid, anxious, or depressed, making it difficult or impossible to maintain employment, pay bills, or keep supportive social relationships.     Substance abuse  can drain financial resources, erode supportive social relationships, and make exiting from homelessness extremely difficult.     Co-occurring disorders.   Individuals with co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders are among the most difficult groups to put in stable housing and treat.  This is due to the limited availability of integrated mental health and substance abuse treatment in most locations.     Other circumstances.  People may become homeless for a variety of other reasons, including divorce or separation, domestic violence, chronic or unexpected health care expenses, release from incarceration, or release from foster care.      back to top    Who is homeless?    An estimated 842,000 adults and children are homeless in any given week, with that number growing to as many as 3.5 million over the course of a year. People who are homeless are the poorest of the poor. While almost half (44%) of homeless people work at least part-time, their monthly income averages only $367, compared to a median monthly income of $2,840 for U.S. households.  Those who have disabilities and are unable to work find it nearly impossible to secure affordable housing in virtually every major housing market in the country.    Most homeless persons are unaccompanied adults.  Sixty-six percent are single adults, and three-quarters of these are men.  However, the number of homeless families is growing:       Eleven percent are parents with children, 84 percent of whom are single women.    Twenty-three percent are children under 18 with a parent, 42 percent of whom are under 5 years of age.       Forty-one percent are non-Hispanic Whites (compared to 76 percent of the general population).  However, racial and ethnic minorities, particularly African Americans, are overrepresented:       Forty percent are African Americans (compared to 11 percent of the general population).    Eleven percent are Hispanics (compared to 9 percent of the general population).    Eight percent are Native Americans (compared to 1 percent of the general population).      Homelessness continues to be a largely urban phenomenon:       Seventy-one percent are in central cities.    Twenty-one percent are in suburbs.    Only 9 percent are in rural areas.      People who are homeless frequently have health problems:       Thirty-eight percent report alcohol use problems.    Twenty-six percent report other drug use problems.    Thirty-nine percent report some form of mental health problem, and 20 to 25 percent meet criteria for serious mental illnesses.    Sixty-six percent report substance use and/or mental health problems.    Three percent report having HIV/AIDS.    Twenty-six percent report acute health problems other than HIV/AIDS such as tuberculosis, pneumonia, or sexually transmitted diseases.    Forty-six percent report chronic health conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or cancer.      People who are homeless also share other common characteristics:       Twenty-three percent are veterans (compared to 13 percent of the general population).     Twenty-five percent were physically or sexually abused as children.    Twenty-seven percent were in foster care or institutions as children.    Twenty-one percent were homeless as children.    Fifty-four percent were incarcerated at some point in their lives.       back to top    Why are so many people with serious mental illnesses homeless?       Their symptoms are often active and untreated, making it extremely difficult for them to meet basic needs for food, shelter, and safety.    These individuals are impoverished, and many are not receiving benefits for which they may be eligible.    Up to 50 percent have co-occurring mental illness and substance use disorders.     People with serious mental illnesses have greater difficulty exiting homelessness than others.  They are homeless more often and for longer periods of time than other homeless populations.  Many have been on the streets for years.      What do we know about people with serious mental illnesses who are homeless?       The majority of people with serious mental illnesses who are homeless had prior contact with the mental health system, either as an inpatient or outpatient. These experiences were not always positive; they may have been hospitalized involuntarily or given treatment services or medications that did not benefit them.     The symptoms of mental illness, combined with the hygiene problems associated with homelessness, result in many untreated physical health problems such as respiratory infections, dermatological problems, and risk of exposure to HIV and tuberculosis.     These individuals typically are long-term citizens of the communities in which they are homeless.    The social support and family networks of these individuals usually have unraveled. Those who are members of families often have lost regular contact with their relatives or are no longer equipped to be primary caregivers.    These individuals are twice as likely as other homeless people to be arrested or jailed, mostly for misdemeanors. They are often good candidates for diversion programs that enable them to go from jail to more appropriate treatment, support, and housing.       back to top    How can we end homelessness for people with serious mental illnesses?    Research has provided much information about what services and practices are effective in ending homelessness for people with serious mental illnesses. Key findings show:       Outreach , whether in shelters or on the street, is effective. Given the opportunity, most homeless people with serious mental illnesses are willing to accept treatment and services voluntarily. Consistent outreach and the introduction of services at the client's pace are key to engaging people in treatment and case management services. A consistent, caring, personal relationship is required to engage people who are homeless in treatment.     Integrated mental health and substance abuse treatment  provided by multidisciplinary treatment teams can improve mental health, residential stability, and overall functioning in the community. Regular assertive outreach, lower caseloads, and the multidisciplinary nature of the services available from these teams are critical ingredients that lead to positive treatment and housing outcomes.    Supportive services to people in housing  have proven effective in achieving residential stability, improving mental health, and reducing the costs of homelessness to the community. Supported housing is preferred by many homeless people with serious mental illnesses. Many people who are homeless with serious mental illnesses can move directly from homelessness to independent housing with intensive support and attention.    Prevention.  Homelessness among people with serious mental illnesses can be prevented. Discharge planning that helps people who are leaving institutions to access housing, mental health, and other necessary community services can prevent homelessness during such transitions. Ideally, such planning begins upon entry into an institution, is ready to be implemented upon discharge, and involves consumer input. Providing short-term intensive support services immediately after discharge from hospitals, shelters, or jails has proven effective in further preventing recurrent homelessness during the transition back into the community.      back to top    Rev. 03/2003                                                   Home    |           Contact Us    |           About Us    |           Awards    |           Privacy and Disclaimer Statement    |           Site Map

Production  Switzerland imports about 95% of its needs in raw tobacco. During the period 1990-93, Switzerland produced an annual average of around 1,400 tonnes of unmanufactured tobacco. In 1994, 30,750 tonnes of unmanufactured tobacco were imported and 7,700 tonnes were exported. Annual cigarette production increased from 32,000 million cigarettes in 1990 to around 40,000 million cigarettes in 1994. From 1990-94, an average of around 400 million cigarettes were imported each year. Exports of cigarettes increased from 15,000 million in 1990 to 24,000 million in 1994, with most cigarettes exported to Eastern Europe and Asia. Switzerland earned about US$ 290 million from tobacco exports in 1993, while imports costs of tobacco amounted to US$ 161 million.    Industry  In 1994, there were reportedly 4,400 people employed in cigarette manufacturing and related businesses in Switzerland. In 1994, tobacco tax revenue totalled around US$ 1 billion.       Tobacco consumption    In 1994, around 16,000 million cigarettes were sold in Switzerland, as were about 170 million cigars and 180 tonnes of smoking tobacco. Annual adult (age 15+) per capita consumption of manufactured cigarettes appeared to have peaked in the early 1970s at around 3,700, and has since decreased gradually to an estimated annual consumption of 2,900 in 1990-92, decreasing to an estimated 2,800 in 1994.                               Consumption of Manufactured Cigarettes                                                    Annual average per adult (15+)                                1970-72                     3,700                                1980-82                     3,060                                1990-92                     2,910                 Tar/nicotine/filters  In 1994, around two-thirds of the cigarettes sold in Switzerland had a tar content of 10 mg or less. In 1994, 99% of the cigarettes manufactured in Switzerland were filter-tipped.    Relative cost of cigarettes  It was estimated that in the early 1990s, it would take around 9 minutes of labour at the average industrial wage to earn enough to purchase a package of 20 cigarettes.       Prevalence    In 1992, 31% of the adult Swiss population were smokers (36% M; 26% F). This reflects a decrease from 37% in 1980 (46% M; 28% F).    Tobacco use among population sub-groups  In 1989, smoking prevalence was lowest in the Swiss-German region (34%), followed by the Swiss-French region (38%), Swiss-Italian region (41%). A 1989 survey among physicians showed that 20% smoked regularly, while 14% were occasional smokers. This is a reduction from 1973/74, when 61% of physicians smoked.    Age patterns  According to a 1992 survey, 14% of 15-17 year-olds smoked as did 36% of 20-24 year-olds. Another survey in 1993, found a daily smoking prevalence of 20% among 16 year-olds.       Mortality from Tobacco Use    After a period of rapid increase between 1950 and 1983, during which time the lung cancer rate (age-standardized) for men more than doubled, mortality from the disease has begun to decline. Between 1983 and 1993, lung cancer mortality fell by about 15% to a level of around 63/100,000. As a result, the annual number of smoking-attributable deaths has fallen slightly, from an estimated 7,000 men in 1985 to 6,800 in 1995. Female lung cancer mortality remained constant at around non-smoker levels between 1950 and 1970, but since then has been rising steadily and is now increasing at an annual rate of more than 5%. Along with Hungary, this represents the most rapid increase in female lung cancer rates anywhere in the world.            Tobacco control measures    Control on tobacco products  New regulations on tobacco came into force in 1995. The regulation limits tar contents 15 mg per cigarette and bans the importation and sale of tobacco products for oral use. In addition to a mandatory general health warning, packages of cigarette and rolling tobacco packs must contain, an additional rotating health warning. There is a ban on the advertising of tobacco products aimed specifically at youth as well as a ban on free promotional items during sporting or cultural events attended primarily by young people. The law also prohibits the use of such descriptors as ""pure"" or ""natural"" except under certain conditions. In 1995, taxes on cigarettes represented 52% of the retail price.    Protection for non-smokers  Nominally, occupational health and safety legislation appears to provide protection from involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke in the workplace. In practice, this legislative provision is rarely enforced.    Health Education   The Swiss Anti-Tobacco Association (AT) run active national health education and health promotion campaigns. A coalition of health agencies is actively promoting the idea of creating a health promotion foundation, funded by new tobacco taxes, to fund sports and cultural events. This already happens in Geneva, where the local Tobacco Education and Prevention Centre (CIPRET), with funds from the municipal government, sponsors sports and cultural events ranging from rock concerts to motorcycle races.

This is a decrease from 52,500 hectares cultivated for tobacco in 1985.    Production and trade  Tobacco production dropped from around 100,000 tonnes per year in the 1980's to around 43,000 tonnes in 1994. During the period 1990-94, an annual average of about 25,000 tonnes of unmanufactured tobacco were imported. Imports averaged around 5,400 tonnes per year from 1990-92. In 1993, Poland produced around 87,000 million cigarettes, slightly less than the amount produced in 1990. Cigarettes imports appear to be decreasing in the mid 1990s, and in 1994, only 2,000 million imports were reported, a substantial decrease from previous years. Exports increased from around 550 million cigarettes in 1990 to around 5,000 million cigarettes in 1994. In 1990, 92% of cigarettes manufactured in Poland were made with domestic leaf. However, by 1992, only half of the cigarettes were made with Polish leaf. Import costs of tobacco in 1993 amounted to US$ 112 million (0.5% of import costs), while export earnings from tobacco were about US$ 38 million in 1993 (0.2% of total export earnings).    Industry  In the early 1990s, an estimated 10,400 persons were employed in the seven manufacturing plants around the country. From 1987 to 1994, the numbers of tobacco farmers decreased from 138,000 to 40,000.       Tobacco consumption    In the mid 1990s, annual adult (age 15+) per capita consumption was among the highest in the world. Consumption increased from around 3,000 in the early 1970s, to around 3,500 in the mid 1980s, to around 3,600 in the early 1990s. In 1980, the average daily consumption of cigarettes was 19 for males and 15 for females.                               Consumption of Manufactured Cigarettes                                                    Annual average per adult (15+)                                1970-72                     3,010                                1980-82                     3,400                                1990-92                     3,620                 Tar/nicotine/filters  In 1994, 83% of the cigarettes manufactured in Poland were filter-tipped. Since 1991, the maximum permitted tar and nicotine content were respectively 20 mg and 1.8 mg per cigarette.       Prevalence    Smoking prevalence (daily and occasional smoking) among adults in Poland has decreased from 46% in 1986 (60%M; 34%F) to 39% in 1993 (51%M; 29%F).    Tobacco use among population sub-groups  Smoking among medical doctors has decreased from 40% in 1980 to 24% in 1986. Data from 1987 indicated that smoking is the lowest among white collar workers (29%) and the highest among unskilled workers (67%).    Age patterns  Results of a 1993/94 study of 15 year olds in Poland showed that 65% of boys and 50% of girls have tried smoking. It was also found (among 15 year-olds) that 23% of boys and 13% of girls smoked at least weekly.       Mortality from Tobacco Use    Lung cancer mortality among Polish men has increased five-fold since the late 1950. The age-standardized death rate reached a level of 100/100,000 in 1987 and is still increasing. Almost 70,000 Polish men are estimated to die each year as a result of tobacco use, more than twice the number (32,000) of two decades ago. Half of all male cancer deaths in Poland are attributable to smoking, as are 40-45% of all male deaths in middle age. Female lung cancer mortality has been steadily increasing since the 1970s and is currently rising at about 3% a year. Between 1975 and 1995, the annual number of deaths among Polish women attributable to smoking has risen from 2,800 to 12,000.            Tobacco control measures    Control on Tobacco products  The Tobacco Control and Health Protection Act came into effect in 1996 . This Act prohibits the advertising and promotion of tobacco products and accessories on television, radio, in cinemas, in newspapers and magazines for youth, as well as in health care establishments, cultural and educational facilities, institutes of higher learning and sports facilities. Each packet of cigarettes must contain health warnings which occupy an area of at least 30% of each of largest sides of a single cigarette package, and tar and nicotine levels must be listed. The sale and production of smokeless tobacco is prohibited. Sales of cigarettes to minors under age 18 are banned as are vending machine sales, single stick sales, and sales of cigarettes in packs with fewer than 20 cigarettes. Valued added tax (VAT) and excise tax were introduced in 1993, and as of 1995, VAT was 22% for tobacco products. Tax banderoles were also introduced in 1993 to bring smuggling under control. Excise taxes are expected to be adjusted so that lower tax rates will prevail for products using larger amounts of domestic tobacco leaf.    Protection for non-smokers  A total smoking ban has been introduced in the majority of hospitals in Poland. Since 1992, smoking has been banned on public transport. The cities of Cracow, Torun, Legnica and Kiele are smoke-free zones which means that smoking is banned in schools, health centres and sport stadiums. According to the 1996 Tobacco Control and Health Protection Act, smoking is forbidden in health care establishments, schools and other educational facilities, indoor workplaces and public buildings, with the exception of areas expressly set aside for smokers.    Health Education  Numerous conferences have been organized throughout Poland on the harmful effects of tobacco. An Anti-tobacco Foundation was initiated in 1992, and holds regular meetings on tobacco-related issues. The Polish Anti-tobacco Society organizes an annual World No-Tobacco Day, and has also actively participated in bringing about increased tobacco legislation. Other organizations actively involved in tobacco control include the Health Promotion Foundation in Warsaw, the Marie Sklododowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Centre, the Polish Ecological Club, the Lions Club of Poznan, the Polish Medical Society, and the Polish Oncological Society. Health education campaigns are organized jointly by many governmental and nongovernmental organizations with the support of the media.       Previous Country  |  Europe  |  Next Country

Production and Trade  In 1992, 1,400 tonnes of unmanufactured tobacco were produced. New Zealand imported 3,250 tonnes of unmanufactured tobacco or about 0.2% of all global imports, and exported only 25 tonnes. New Zealand is largely self-sufficient in supplying cigarettes for its domestic market, with relatively low levels of imports and exports. Since 1990, New Zealand produce 6,250 million cigarettes annually, accounting for about 0.1% of world production. New Zealand imports 15 million and exports 75 million cigarettes annually. Import costs of tobacco and cigarettes in 1990 amounted to US$ 14.7 million, or 0.1% of all import costs. New Zealand earned US$ 1.3 million in 1990 from cigarette and tobacco exports, up from about US$ 1.2 million in 1985.    Industry  It is estimated that in 1991, 500 people were employed full-time and 18 part-time by the tobacco industry in 1987. In 1992, it was reported that the New Zealand government earned around US$ 346 million a year in tax revenues from tobacco products.       Tobacco consumption    Around 94% of all tobacco consumed in New Zealand is in the form of manufactured cigarettes, with the remainder used for roll-your-own cigarettes. Annual adult per capita consumption has decreased steadily since the mid 1970s. In 1990, male smokers smoked on average 21.2 cigarettes per day, and females smoked 18.5. In 1992-3 only 15% of male and 11% of female smokers smoked 20 or more cigarettes daily, down from 51% and 34% respectively in 1976.                               Consumption of Manufactured Cigarettes (incl. RYO's)                                                    Annual average per adult (15+)                                1970-72                    3,060                                1980-82                    2,890                                1990-92                    2,510                 Tar/Nicotine/Filters  In 1990, tar levels of cigarettes ranged from 5 mg to 18 mg, and nicotine levels from 0.60 mg to 1.80 mg. 100% of cigarettes sold are filter-tipped.    Relative cost of cigarettes  In 1995, the average retail price of a packet of 20 cigarettes was US$ 3.38. About 19 minutes of labour, at the average adult wage, is required to purchase a packet of 20 cigarettes.       Prevalence    Prevalence among males and females has declined since 1976, when 40% of males and 32% of females smoked. As of 1992, 23% of adults smoked (24%M, 22%F). In 1989, 52% of ever smokers had quit (54.1%M; 49.6%F), compared to 26.8% (40.7%M; 32.4%F) in 1976, indicating that more females are now quitting.    Tobacco use among population sub-groups   Data for 1981 indicate that smoking is lowest in professional workers (21%M; 25%F), higher in clerical (32%M; 33%F), managerial (32%M; 34%F), and sales workers (36%M;33%F), and highest in service workers (42%M; 44%F). In this survey, 15% of male and 13% of female physicians were current smokers, while 38% of male and 31% of female nurses, and 19% of male and 20% of female teachers smoked. Smoking is strongly inversely associated with education. There are marked ethnic disparities in smoking prevalence. In 1992-3, smoking was highest among the Maori population (44%), followed by Pacific Islanders (26%) and European/Pakeha people (21%).    Age Patterns   According to a 1991 survey, the highest prevalence for males and females occurs at age 25-34 years (35.3% for males, 30.4% for females), with 3 in every 10 young persons (ages 15-19) taking up smoking.       Mortality from Tobacco Use    In 1995, it is estimated that 4,500 deaths (or 18% of all deaths) will be caused by tobacco (21%M;14%F),a slightly decreased percentage for men compared with 1985 (23%) but increased for women from 17%. Among women, the percentage of smoking attributable deaths in middle age (35-69 years) increased dramatically from 3% in 1965 to an estimated 22% in 1995, while remaining at around 26% for middle-aged males. In 1995, an estimated 17% of all deaths over the age of 70 will be attributed to smoking (22%M,12%F). Lung cancer rates for men peaked between 1975-85 and are now declining rapidly. Conversely, lung cancer mortality rates are rising among women.            Tobacco Control Measures    Anti-smoking education began in 1948, and in 1970, the New Zealand Cancer Society, National Heart Foundation, TB and Chest Diseases Society joined in anti-smoking campaigns. ASH (Action on Smoking and Health) was founded in 1982, and funded by the Cancer Society, the National Heart Foundation and the Asthma Society.    Control on Tobacco Products  The first anti-tobacco legislation was in 1903, and since then several major pieces of legislation have been passed, including the 1990 comprehensive Smoke-free Environments Act. There is a ban on the sale of tobacco products to persons under 16, as well as a ban on smokeless tobacco. Advertising of tobacco products is severely restricted: television and radio advertisements for tobacco were banned in 1963, and cinema and outdoor advertising banned in 1973. The 1990 Act imposed a total ban on all tobacco advertising, except those printed or transmitted from outside New Zealand. The Smoke-Free Environment Act also created the Health Sponsorship Council. The Council has become a very popular source of funds for the sponsorship of sports and cultural activities, completely replacing tobacco company sponsorship. The Council's funding is not tied to tobacco taxes, but is supplied from general government revenues. Since 1 July 1995, New Zealand has a total ban on tobacco sponsorship.    Health warnings have been required on all cigarette packets since 1973, then strengthened and increased to four in 1988 to include all promotions and products. Harmful ingredients must be listed on the packet, and a leaflet inserted into the packet. Between 1980 and 1991, New Zealand added US $1.97 to cigarette taxes, nearly doubling overall price. During this time, the number of cigarettes purchased per person annually dropped from 4,100 to just over 1,500. The price of cigarettes was increased again by 15% in 1991. As of 1995, taxes comprised 68% of the retail price of cigarettes. In December 1994, the New Zealand Government announced plans to introduce amendments to the Smokefree Environments Act which would raise the legal age for buying cigarettes from 16 to 18, ban single sales and strengthen health warnings on packs.    Protection for non-smokers  Smoking is restricted in hospitals, on passenger service vehicles, ships and trains, in passenger lounges, and waiting rooms. In one-roomed restaurants, half the seating must be designated non-smoking, while in multi-roomed restaurants, at least one room must be designated non-smoking. Smoking is banned on domestic airline flights. The 1990 Act requires every employer to prepare a written workplace policy, with minimum restrictions. The Act also restricts smoking in rest homes and prisons.    Health education  In 1979 a television campaign targeted teenagers, and a national Smoke-free week was implemented in 1986. Many health promotion and eduction activities recieve funding from the Health Sponsorship Council. There are now numerous health education activities, and World No-Tobacco Day is celebrated annually.       Previous Country  |  Western Pacific  |  Next Country

Much of these costs can be attributed to the diagnosis and treatment of chronic diseases and conditions such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease and asthma.            Approximately 129 million U.S. adults are overweight or obese which costs     this Nation anywhere from $69 billion to $117 billion per year.         In 2000, an estimated 17 million people (6.2 percent of the population) had     diabetes, costing the U.S. approximately $132 billion. People with diabetes     lost more than 8 days per year from work, accounting for 14 million disability     days.         Heart disease and stroke are the first and third leading causes of death     in the United States. In 2003 alone, 1.1 million Americans will have a heart     attack. Cardiovascular diseases cost the Nation more than $300 billion each     year.         Approximately 23 million adults and 9 million children have been diagnosed     with asthma at some point within their lifetime, with costs near $14 billion     per year.     A much smaller amount is spent on preventing these conditions. There is accumulating evidence that much of the morbidity and mortality associated with these chronic diseases may be preventable.   For many Americans, individual behavior and lifestyle choices influence the development and course of these chronic conditions. Unhealthy behaviors, such as a poor diet, lack of physical activity, and tobacco use are risk factors for many chronic conditions and diseases. A high calorie diet and sedentary lifestyle commonly result in excessive weight gain. Overweight and obesity are risk factors for a large number of chronic diseases, most significantly, type 2 diabetes, congestive heart failure, stroke, and hypertension. Encouraging individuals to adopt healthy habits and practices may reduce the burden of chronic disease in communities throughout the United States.   Recently, public and private efforts and programs are increasingly designed to promote healthy behaviors. Employers are becoming more aware that overweight and obesity, lack of physical activity, and tobacco use are adversely affecting the health and productivity of their employees and ultimately, the businesses' bottom line. As a result, innovative employers are providing their employees with a variety of work-site-based health promotion and disease prevention programs. These programs have been shown to improve employee health, increase productivity and yield a significant return on investment for the employer. For example, a recent review of health promotion and disease management programs found a significant return on investment for these programs, with benefit-to-cost ratios, ranging from $1.49 to $4.91 (median of $3.14) in benefits for every dollar spent on the program. Several major companies with award-winning cost-saving health promotion disease prevention programs are profiled in this report and include: (1)            Motorola's wellness program, which stet the company $3.93 for every $1 invested.         Northeast Utilities WellAware Program, which in its first 24 months reduced     lifestyle and behavioral claims by $1,400,000.         Caterpillar's Healthy Balance program, which is projected to result in long     term savings of $700 million by 2015.         Johnson & Johnson's Health and Wellness Program, which has produced average     annual health care savings of $224.66 per employee.     By changing the way they live, individual Americans could change their personal health status and the health landscape of the Nation dramatically.   In 2003, it is estimated that the U.S. will spend $1.66 trillion on health care expenditures. (2)  Health care spending is growing faster than the gross domestic product (GDP) and is projected to account for 17.7 percent of the GDP by 2012, up from 14.1 percent in 2001. A small number of chronic disorders-such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases-account for the majority of deaths each year, and the medical care costs of people with chronic diseases account for more than 75 percent of the nation's medical care costs. (3)  As the population of the United States ages substantially over the next several decades, the prevalence of chronic diseases--and their impact on health care costs--will likely increase.   Each individual's health is shaped by many factors including medical care, social circumstances, and behavioral choices. (4)  Increasingly, there is clear evidence that the major chronic conditions that account for so much of the morbidity and mortality in the U.S., and the enormous direct and indirect costs associated with them, in large part are preventable-and that to a considerable degree they stem from, and are exacerbated by, individual behaviors. In particular, overweight and obesity, lack of physical activity, and smoking greatly increase the risk of developing the most serious chronic disorders. Most of the dollars spent on health care in the United States, however, are for the direct care of medical conditions, while only a very small portion is targeted on preventing those conditions. (5)  As Americans see health care expenditures continue to increase, it is important to focus on strategies that reduce the prevalence and cost of preventable diseases. This paper summarizes recent research findings on the prevalence, effects and costs of some of these key preventable conditions and highlights several award-winning business prevention programs that make common ""cents."" (6)                       "" So many of our health problems can be avoided through diet, exercise  and making sure we take care of ourselves. By promoting healthy lifestyles,  we can improve the quality of life for all Americans, and reduce health care  costs dramatically .""    Tommy G. Thompson, Secretary, DHHS                   OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY      Public health officials refer to obesity as an epidemic. The prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased dramatically in recent years, doubling since 1980,and now is seen by the CDC as one of the top threats to the health of the Nation. (7)  Weight gain is a direct function of an imbalance between the amount of calories consumed and the amount of calories expended by an individual. While there are some genetic determinants of obesity, much, if not most, of the recent increase in prevalence of obesity in the U.S.population stems from changes in people's diets and the level of their physical activity. To some extent, these dietary changes may reflect the greater availability of pre-packaged foods, low-cost-big-portion restaurant meals, and soft drinks, all of which may be high in sugar, calories, and/or fat. This increase in obesity has occurred even though the public generally is more educated about what constitutes a healthy diet and ingredients in food products have become more clearly identified on labels.   On the other side of the equation, changing people's habits related to physical activity has proved to be a challenging task. Individuals who want to be more physically active, often find it difficult to do so because of demands, and other constraints associated with their work, family, and community. According to a recent study by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), less than a third of US adults engage in regular leisure-time physical activity, and only about one-fifth of adults engage in a high level of overall physical activity. (8)  One study looked at adults who were  trying  to lose or not gain weight and found that less than 20 percent of the individuals were following recommendations about increasing physical activity and reducing calories. (9)  Also notable is a finding that only 42.8 percent of obese people who had routine checkups in the past months had been urged during those visits to lose weight. (10)    The current widely-used definition for overweight in adults is a body mass index (BMI) of 25 to 29.9, and for obesity in adults, a BMI of 30 or over. BMI is calculated solely on the basis of the height and weight of an individual; the calculation does not take into consideration the sex of the individual, the proportion of fat and muscle, or different body shapes. Waist circumference is also an independent predictor of risk factors and morbidity. (11)  Overweight and obesity are defined differently for children and adolescents; they are considered to be overweight at or above the 95 th  percentile of the sex-specific BMI for age growth charts. Obesity in children is not specifically defined.                         Motorola      Forty-five thousand U.S. employees, family members, retirees benefit from  Motorola's wellness programs. Motorola invests $6 million annually in wellness  and work/life programs. Motorola's Long-term wellness program goals include:  enhance education, prevention, and wellness strategy; demonstrate return  on investment; advocate healthy culture. Support programs include disease  management (asthma, cancer, depression, diabetes, infectious diseases); flu  immunizations, cancer screenings, smoking cessation; health screenings and  health risk appraisals; 24/7 nurse telephone line; health fairs; back care;  on-site/external wellness centers; children's aerobics and nutrition; stress  management, and shiftwork wellness.     Evidence of the program's cost-effectiveness include: for every $1 invested  in wellness benefits, $3.93 saved; a 2.4% increase in annual aggegate health  care costs for participating employees compared with 18% increase for  non-participants; $6.5 million annual savings in medical expenses for  lifestyle-related diagnoses (e.g., obesity, hypertension, stress) compared  with non-participants; and $6.5 million annual savings in medical expenses  for lifestyle-related diagnoses (e.g., obesity, hypertension, stress) compared  with non-participants.

inches                As displayed above, an individual who is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 195 pounds would have a BMI of 28 and would be considered overweight. An adult who is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 250 pounds would have a BMI of 36 and would be considered obese.      The Prevalence of Overweight and Obesity      Recent estimates indicate that more than129 million U.S. adults are considered to be overweight or obese. (12)  Approximately two-thirds of the adult population are either overweight or obese, and slightly less than one-third are obese. (13) [Note: While there have been lower estimates of the proportions of overweight and obese individuals recently, they were based on self-reported measures of height and weight and consequently are most likely under-estimates. (14) ] Even though their specific prevalence estimates may differ somewhat, all studies in recent years have shown dramatic  increases  in the prevalence of overweight and obesity, with one study determining that obesity rose from 22.9 percent to 30.5 percent between 1988 and 2000, while extreme obesity, defined as a BMI of 40 or over, increased from 2.9 percent to 4.7 percent over this period. (15)             Figure1.  Source of data:1991-2001 Prevalence of Obesity Among U. S. Adults, by Characteristic; Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System; Self-reported data.   CDC website:  www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/obesity/trend/prev_char.htm    While the prevalence of overweight and obesity is high and increasing in all ages, in men and women, across different racial and ethnic groups, and across education and income levels, it does vary somewhat. Among adults, the age group with the smallest proportion of obese people is ages 18 through 29 years. However, this same age group has shown the largest percentage increase in obesity of all age groups, rising from 7.1 percent in 1991 to 14 percent in 2001-a 97 percent increase. (16) , (17)    Dramatic increases in the prevalence of overweight and obesity also have occurred in children and adolescents of both sexes, with approximately 15.3 percent of children aged 6 to 11 years and 15.5 percent of adolescents aged 12 to 19 years considered to be overweight. (18)  The prevalence in adolescents has almost tripled in the past twenty years. (19)  More than 10 percent of children aged 2 through 5 years are overweight. (20)  As is the case with adults, children and adolescents have become less physically active and are consuming more calories. They also have greater access to increasingly larger portions of foods high in calories, fat, and sugar. Research has shown that children will eat more when served large portions than they will when they serve themselves, (21)  and when adolescents eat on their own and not with their families, they are less likely to eat healthy food including fruits and vegetables. (22)       The Effects of Overweight and Obesity      Overweight and obesity significantly affect the health, quality of life, and life expectancy of the U.S. population. Excess weight is a risk factor for a large number of diseases and chronic conditions; it can contribute to the onset of these disorders and it can make them worse. Conversely, overweight individuals can reduce the risk for some chronic disorders by losing as little as 5 percent to 15 percent of their weight.  (23)  Obesity is believed to be associated with more chronic disorders and worse physical health-related quality of life than is smoking or problem drinking. (24)  Estimates of the deaths of U.S. adults due to causes related to obesity range from 280,000 to 325,000 each year. (25) ,  (26) , (27)  There is evidence that overweight and obesity raise the risk for a wide variety of medical conditions.                      Overweight and obesity raise the risk for:                                type 2 diabetes           high blood pressure           high cholesterol levels           coronary heart disease           congestive heart failure           angina pectoris           stroke           asthma           osteoarthritis           musculoskeletal disorders           gallbladder disease           sleep apnea and respiratory problems           gout           bladder control problems                              poor female reproductive health        – complications of pregnancy        – menstrual irregularities        – infertility        – irregular ovulation           cancers of the        – uterus        – breast        – prostate        – kidney        – liver        – pancreas        – esophagus        – colon and rectum                          It is estimated that 47 million U.S. adults have a cluster of medical conditions, referred to as the ""metabolic syndrome,"" characterized by insulin resistance and the presence of obesity, abdominal fat, high blood sugar and triglycerides, high blood cholesterol, and high blood pressure. (28)  Recent research also suggests that obesity increases the risk for progression to advanced stages of age-related macular degeneration, a disorder affecting a large proportion of the elderly. (29)  Overweight and obesity also can reduce mobility and physical endurance, can lead to psychological disorders, and can result in social, academic, and job discrimination. (30) , (31) , (32) , (33) ,  (34) , (35) , (36)    Estimates of the number of years of life lost as a result of overweight and obesity range as high as 20 years of life lost for certain age and racial/ethnic groups. For example, a 20-year-old white male could realize a 17 percent reduction in life expectancy due to obesity. (37)  Years of life lost is a simple measure of mortality, and does not reflect the fullimpact of obesity on morbidity and quality of life. It has been suggested that measuring the number of  healthy, disability-free  years of life lost might be more informative than focusing only on actual years lost. (38)  Researchers have suggested that in terms of the physical quality of life, the effect of obesity can be the equivalent of aging as much as 30 years. (39)         Figure 2.  Source of data: Ref.37.       The Costs of Overweight and Obesity      Over the last several decades, researchers have provided many estimates of the costs of overweight and obesity. These estimates differ according to their scope (e.g., the individual person, a particular company or health plan, or the Nation as a whole), the timeliness of the data, and the methods used to derive them, including how obesity is defined, how the prevalence of obesity is determined, what associated disorders are included, the degree to which these disorders and obesity are considered to be associated, how costs are defined, and the assumptions used in calculating those costs. As with other chronic conditions, estimates may focus on direct costs to the community, including the costs of health care services, physicians and other health care professionals, hospital admissions, and medicines; indirect costs, such as loss of productivity caused by absenteeism, disability, and premature death; or personal costs, such as reduced earnings, higher insurance costs, reduced quality of life, and out-of-pocket expenses for individuals. (40)  These cost estimates are approximations, and it becomes even more difficult to estimate the costs of the effects of obesity over very long periods of time.    Health Care Utilization- Research has shown that as body mass increases, so too do health care utilization and costs. (41)  Obesity may account for as much as a 36% increase in costs for inpatient and ambulatory care for individuals-a greater increase than that attributed to aging 20 years, smoking, or problem drinking. (42)  In addition to using more physician and hospital services, obese individuals have high annual costs for medications, particularly those for diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD). One researcher estimated that obese individuals may pay as much as 77 percent more for medications compared to non-obese individuals. (43)  Conversely, there is evidence that patients who lose weight reduce their use of these kinds of medications, and even modest sustained weight loss (a reduction of 10 percent in body weight) may reduce expected lifetime health care costs for major obesity-related diseases by $2,200 to $5,300, depending on age, gender, and initial BMI. (44) , (45) , (46) , (47)     Personal Costs- Even the financial well-being of individuals may be associated with their weight. Researchers analyzed data from the University of Michigan Health and Retirement Study on more than 7,000 men and women between the ages of 57 and 67, and found that heavier women had significantly smaller individual net worth, even after controlling for health, marital status and other demographic factors. (48)  (The association between obesity and the net worth of the men were smaller and not statistically significant.)    Significant Costs- Most estimates of total (direct and indirect combined) costs of overweight and obesity to the Nation range from $69 billion per year to $117 billion per year. (49) ,  (50) , (51) , (52) , (53)  This estimated $117 billion includes $61 billion for direct costs and $56 billion for indirect costs. One study of the costs of treating major disorders relating to obesity estimated that obesity cost the Nation as much as $102 billion for direct costs alone in 1999. (These amounts represent 27 percent to 31 percent of the total costs of treating these disorders, regardless of obesity.) (54)  Included in this $102 billion were:           $6.7 - $7.4 billion for arthritis;         $25.5 - $30.6 billion for heart disease;         $18.4 - $20.5 billion for type 2 diabetes;         $8.3 - $9.6 billion for hypertension; and         $6.1 - $8.1 billion for stroke.     Contributing to the overall trends, annual hospital costs for obesity-related disorders in children ages 6 to 17 years increased from $35 million to $127 million between 1979 and 2000. (55)                        DaimlerChrysler      DaimlerChrysler is an international automotive and transportation company  with over 95,000 employees throughout the United States. Its  National  Wellness Program  began in 1985 and is a negotiated benefit between  DaimlerChrysler Corporation and the International Union, UAW. All U.S. sites  with 500+ employees have on-site contracted health and fitness business partners  (over 100 FTEs) to administer program. The program has voluntary participation.  Key components of the  National Wellness Program  includes: targeted  education programs, based on identified health risks and interests; focused  education programs which support employees throughout process of lifestyle  change; smoking cessation, weight management, cholesterol management, and  fitness activities; one-time workshops, multi-session classes, individual  counseling, and self-directed modules; maintenance strategies which include  ongoing awareness, interactive campaigns, group support with on-site services  (e.g., fitness facilities, cafeteria/vending programs, walking routes);     Savings estimates revealed that participation in the  National Wellness  Program  was associated with significant savings in dollars per employee  from 1991 to 1995, with the highest dollar savings achieved in 1995 ($16  per employee per month). Evaluation of the program showed that health risk  assessment was associated with significant and substantial reductions in  healthcare costs. Employees who completed one, two, or three health risk  assessments on average had lower 1997 health care costs of $112.89, $134.22,  and $152.29, respectively. Employees who had completed at least one health  risk assessment and participated in an additional wellness activity had an  average cost savings of $200.35 per year.     To contact DaimlerChrysler for more detailed information, see:   www.Chrysler.com.                 Increasing U.S. Health Care Costs- The direct health care costs of overweight and obesity represent a significant portion of  total   annual U.S. health care expenditures, with estimates ranging from 4.3 percent   of total expenditures to as much as 9.1 percent. (56) , (57)  Moreover, Medicare and Medicaid may finance as much as half of these costs, with Medicare covering the larger share due to the more substantial medical problems associated with obesity in the elderly. Researchers have found that obese people who reach 65 years of age have much larger annual Medicare expenditures than non-obese people. For the period between 1996 and 1998, a 15 percent increase in annual per capita Medicare spending is attributable to being overweight, and a 37 percent increase is attributed to being obese.   (58)         Figure 3. Source of data: Ref. 54.     Impact on Businesses- Employers and businesses bear a sizable portion of costs associated with treating obesity-related conditions, primarily in terms of lost productivity and the increased cost of health and disability insurance. Studies of overweight and obese employees have shown that obese employees take more sick leave than non-obese employees and are twice as likely to have high-level absenteeism (seven or more health-related absences during the last six months). (59) , (60)  In addition, another study found a reduction in the use of sick leave and disability pension by obese employees in the second and third years following surgical treatment of their obesity. (61)  An analysis of business costs in the late 1980s through the mid-1990s found that in 1994, due to conditions associated with obesity:           employees lost 39.3 million workdays (a 50 percent increase since 1988);         made 62.7 million visits to physician offices (a 88 percent increase);         had 239 million restricted activity days (a 36 percent increase), and         89.5 bed-days (a 28 percent increase). (62) , (63)      The costs to U.S.businesses of obesity-related health problems in 1994 added up to almost $13 billion, with approximately $8 billion of this paying for health insurance expenditures, $2.4 billion for sick leave, $1.8 billion for life insurance, and close to $1 billion for disability insurance. (64)       DIABETES      Diabetes is a group of diseases in which blood glucose (sugar) levels are elevated either because of failure to make adequate amounts of the hormone insulin or failure of cells to respond to insulin. Diabetes results from interaction between inherited, autoimmune, and environmental factors.   There are two principal forms of diabetes that account for the majority of cases.            Type 1 diabetes- often called ""insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus""     or juvenile-onset diabetes, develops when the body's immune system destroys     pancreatic beta cells, the cells in the body that make the hormone insulin     that regulates blood glucose. Thus the pancreas can no longer produce insulin.     This form of diabetes usually strikes children and young adults, and requires     them to take several insulin injections a day to survive. Type 1 diabetes     may account for 5 to 10 percent of all diagnosed cases of diabetes.      (65)           Type 2 diabetes- is sometimes termed ""adult-onset diabetes"" or ""non-insulin     dependent diabetes mellitus,"" even though some affected individuals require     insulin for control of the disease. Type 2 diabetes usually begins as insulin     resistance, a disorder in which cells do not use insulin properly. As it     progresses, the pancreas gradually loses its ability to produce insulin.     Type 2 diabetes often appears after age 40, although it is now being diagnosed     increasingly in children and adolescents. This form of diabetes accounts     for 90 to 95 percent of all diagnosed cases of     diabetes. (66)      In addition, some women develop diabetes during pregnancy. This form of diabetes is called gestational diabetes, and affects 2 to 5 percent of all pregnancies. After pregnancy, 5 to 10 percent of women with gestational diabetes are found to have Type 2 diabetes and women who have had gestational diabetes are at increased risk for developing Type 2 diabetes in the next 5 to 10 years. (67) Other less common types of diabetes result from specific genetic conditions, surgery, drugs, malnutrition, infections and other illnesses. Taken together, these causes account for 1 to 5 percent of all diagnosed cases of diabetes.      The Prevalence of Diabetes      Diabetes affects a substantial proportion of the U.S. adult population. In 2000, it was estimated that 17 million people-6.2 percent of the population had diabetes. (68)  This included 11.1 million people with diagnosed diabetes and 5.9 million people whose diabetes was undiagnosed. Of this number, 7.8 million were men and 9.1 million were women. One million new cases of diabetes in people aged 20 years or older are diagnosed each year, and diabetes was the 6 th  leading cause of death in 1999.   While increases in the prevalence of diabetes have been documented in the past, more research is needed to determine the extent to which the prevalence of diabetes is changing, and the factors that are contributing to such changes. Most research suggests that overweight and obesity, and lack of physical activity, are associated with an increased risk for diabetes. However, it is possible that an association between recent increases in the prevalence of obesity and overweight and the prevalence of diabetes may not be immediately apparent but only observed over the long term. (69)    Risk factors for Type 1 diabetes include autoimmune, genetic and environmental factors. Type 2 diabetes is associated with older age, obesity, family history of diabetes, prior history of gestational diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, physical inactivity and race/ethnicity. African Americans, Hispanic/Latino Americans, American Indians and some Asian Pacific Islanders are at particularly high risk for Type 2 diabetes. (70)    Increasingly, health care providers are finding more and more children and teens with Type 2 diabetes, which is usually found in people over age 40. Although there are no national data, it is estimated that Type 2 diabetes represents 8 to 45 percent of all patients with diabetes currently diagnosed in large U.S. pediatric centers. However, this may represent an underestimate and the incidence may likely be rising. African American, Hispanic/Latino American, and American Indian children who are obese and who have a family history of Type 2 diabetes are at especially high risk.  (71) The CDC has estimated that one in three persons born in the U.S. in 2000 has a life-time risk of developing diabetes, unless significant changes occur in patterns of eating and exercising, and that 39 million people in the U.S. could have diabetes by 2050.      The Effects of Diabetes      Untreated or poorly treated diabetes can result in death or significant disability, including heart disease and stroke, kidney failure, blindness and lower limb amputations. More than 60 percent of non-traumatic lower-limb amputations occur among diabetics. Diabetes is the leading cause of new cases of blindness for adults aged 20-74, and is the leading cause of treated end-stage renal disease accounting for 43 percent of new cases. Other complications of diabetes include: high blood pressure, nervous system damage, dental disease, complications of pregnancy, acute life threatening events caused by biochemical imbalances, and susceptibility to other illnesses and worse prognosis over the course of these illnesses. (72)                          Union Pacific       Union Pacific's vision is to be the healthiest company in America. Over 27,000  employees have participated in Union Pacific's Health Risk Assessment and  participated in follow-up programs when appropriate. Union Pacific's long-term  wellness program goals include: continue decrease in lifestyle related health  care claims, enhance employee productivity, improve employer relations and  decrease injuries and absenteeism.     The Health Track Program includes a Health Risk Assessment, follow-up  intervention programs which are stage based, a Smoking Cessation Program  called Butt Out and Breathe, which includes a pharmacological assistance benefit,  over 500 contracted Fitness Facilities across our system, an incentive program  tied to the Company's incentive program and research study participation.  Health Screenings, an occupational health nurse network in our major repair  facilities and support of local management and Executive Staff of the Company  facilitate the program.     Evidence of the program's cost-effectiveness include: over a 10% decrease  in Health Care Costs due to Lifestyle Related Factors equating to a $53.6  million dollar difference in 2001; smoking prevalence at Union Pacific has  dropped from 40% to 28% in the last 10 years; and Union Pacific has won a  number of national awards in the last several years for its health programs.     To contact Union Pacific for more detailed information, see:   www.up.com .                   The Costs of Diabetes      A comparison of national cost estimates over time is difficult because of changes in the U.S. population and changes in the cost of health care services. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) estimated the national cost of diabetes in 1997 to be $98 billion. (73)   The ADA has updated this estimate for 2002 to $132 billion. This includes $91.8 billion in direct medical expenditures ($23.2 billion for diabetes care, $24.6 billion for chronic complications attributable to diabetes, and $44.1 billion for excess prevalence of general medical conditions.), with inpatient days, nursing home care and office visits making up the biggest expenditure categories by service setting. Indirect expenditures totaled $39.8 billion and resulted from lost workdays, restricted activity days, mortality and permanent disability due to diabetes. CDC research has shown that people with diabetes lost 8.3 days per year from work, accounting for 14 million disability days, compared to 1.7 days for people without diabetes. (74)  The ADA study examined total U.S. expenditures for major health care services, including inpatient, hospital outpatient, emergency, physician office, nursing home, home health and hospice care, and determined that these services cost a total of $865 billion, and that $160 billion or 18.5 percent of this total was incurred by people with diabetes. Per capita medical expenditures totaled $13,243 for people with diabetes and $2,560 for people without diabetes. When differences in age, sex, and race/ethnicity are adjusted for, people with diabetes had medical expenditures that were 2.4 times higher than expenditures that would have been incurred by the same group if they had not had diabetes. (75)    There are no known methods for preventing Type 1 diabetes. Research studies have found that lifestyle changes, such as altering diet, increasing moderate physical activity and lowering body weight by 5 to 7 percent, can prevent or delay the onset of Type 2 diabetes.  (76)  Studies have also shown that medications have been successful in preventing diabetes in some population groups.        Figure 4. Source of data: Ref. 73.    Once diagnosed, effective management of diabetes is key to preventing its complications. Controlling glucose, blood pressure and blood lipids reduce health risks. Preventive care can also reduce eye disease, reduce the risk of amputation and allow for the early detection and treatment of diabetic-related kidney disease. The American Diabetes Association reports that people with diabetes who control their disease by keeping their blood sugar down cost employers only $24 a month, compared with the $115 a month for people with diabetes who do not control their blood sugar. (77)    Numerous studies have found that disease management programs have substantial benefits for people with diabetes, in terms of improving health outcomes and the quality of life. (78)   Particular interventions are associated with improved outcomes. Screening and timely intervention with laser photocogulation reduces the incidence of severe vision loss as a consequence of diabetes and has been called cost-effective. According to a 1996 study, the currently recommended screening and treatment for eye disease in persons with diabetes cost $1,757 per life-year of sight saved or $3,190 per quality-adjusted life year gained (1990 dollars). (79)  Similarly, yearly foot exams for high risk patients, which have increased dramatically in the past decade, reduce the risk of lower extremity amputation. (80)    Health plans and providers are increasingly looking to disease management programs as a means for improving care and controlling costs. The American Association of Health Plans reports that virtually all health plans now offer at least one disease management program. (81)  Often these programs focus on diabetes. For example, Cor Solutions Medical, a privately held disease management contractor, works with diabetics, primarily over the phone, answering questions, reminding them of routine medical appointments and helping patients manage their disease. Its CEO states that its approach cuts the cost for caring for a diabetic by up to 20 percent per month, while improving rates of diagnostic testing and annual foot exams.                         Caterpillar      The goals of Caterpillar's Healthy Balance Program include: motivate positive  change in modifiable health risk behaviors; reduce health risks, improve  long-term health status; promote self-efficacy and informed decision-making;  reduce healthcare and related costs; achieve exceptional participation via  strong incentives. The program has a high participation and retention rate:  93% of incented employees and 62% of spouses. Key features of the Healthy  Balance Program include: strong incentives; top-down management support;  spouses included; continuous evaluation/improvement. Components of the program  include: both demand reduction and behavior change components; low-cost  confidential health assessment; personalized health education messages;  stratification: low/high risk, periodic assessment based on risk; individualized  interventions, targeted to health risks and readiness-to-change; intensive  high risk/chronic condition interventions, including disease management phone  counseling; serial tracking, ongoing monitoring/adjustment of interventions;  coordination with related interventions (on-site classes, referral to community  programs, etc.); self-care book and quarterly newsletters; toll-free health  information line and audio library; Internet website with links to sites  with scientifically validated information; and ongoing evaluation of claims,  health assessments; communication of summary results to employees.     Caterpillar predicts that the Healthy Balance Program will lead to long term  savings of $700 million by 2015. To date, the program has reduced the aggregate  health risk score by 6% for the ""low-risk"" population and 14% for ""high-risk""  subjects. This decline in aggregate risk represents improvement in major  risk factors: physical activity, cigarette smoking, stress, fat and fiber  consumption, etc. Participants who completed the high-risk program reduced  their doctor office visits by 17%, and hospital days by 28%.     To contact Caterpillar for more detailed information, see:   www.caterpillar.com .                Despite growing evidence that diabetes disease management programs result in improved health outcomes, opportunities exist to improve the effectiveness of these interventions. A disease management program typically is a bundle of services, designed to improve the care delivered and compliance with recommended treatments and behaviors. Because of the multi-pronged approach, it is challenging to disentangle the value of each component part of a disease management program. (82)    In addition, measurement issues are also challenging since diabetes is a disease whose natural progression is to worsen over time. That said, one study suggests a payback on investment within 33 months but calls for further study prior to major implementation. (83)  Other studies are more cautious, although they find substantial benefits in terms of health outcomes over time. A 2003 study examined the business case for diabetes management programs in two managed care plans and quantified the health benefits for participants in a diabetes disease management program over 10 years at $31,000 per patient in terms of length and quality of life. (84)       CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is predominantly caused by atherosclerosis--a hardening of the arteries--due to a thickening of the lining of the arteries. Atherosclerosis results in inadequate blood flow to particular tissues in the body, causing poor function, damage, or death of those tissues. In heart disease and stroke, the principal components of CVD, atherosclerosis affects the arteries of the heart and brain, respectively. CVD accounts for 40 percent of the mortality in the United States, killing about 950,000 Americans annually. (85)  Taken as a whole, CVD is the cause of more deaths than the next five causes of death combined. (86) , (87)       The Prevalence of Cardiovascular Disease      Heart disease and stroke are the first and third leading causes of death in the United States, respectively, in both men and women. The 2000 age-adjusted death rate from CVD among the general population was 343.1 per 100,000 people. (88)    Coronary heart disease (CHD), caused by blockage of the arteries supplying the heart, is the single leading cause of death within the array of cardiovascular diseases. This year, an estimated 1.1 million Americans will have a new or recurrent coronary attack and more than 45 percent of the people experiencing these attacks will die of them. The age-adjusted 2000 death rate from coronary heart disease was about 186.9 per 100,000 for the total population. (89)  Recent studies have demonstrated that the number of sudden deaths from heart disease among people aged 15-34 have increased from 2,719 in 1989 to 3,000 in 1996.  (90)    It is commonly believed that CVD primarily affects men and older people. However, research shows that more than half of all CVD deaths each year occur among women.   A consideration of mortality alone understates the burden of CVD. About 61 million Americans (almost one-fourth of the general population) live with some form of CVD, including coronary heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, congenital heart defects, and other diseases of the circulatory system. (91)  Prevalence rates for CVD vary by race and ethnicity: (92)    Heart disease also results in significant disability among working adults. Stroke is a leading cause of serious, long-term disability that accounts for more than half of all patients hospitalized for a neurological disease. Of the 4.5 million Americans who have had a stroke, 1 million have been impaired by some form of long-term disability. Almost 6 million hospitalizations each year are due to CVD. (93)         Figure 5.  Source: CDC Compressed Mortality Data     Risk Factors for Cardiovascular Disease    As discussed earlier, untreated or poorly treated diabetes can result in cardiovascular disease. In addition, the CDC has identified five key risk factors for CVD: tobacco use, high cholesterol levels, lack of physical activity, poor nutrition, and high blood pressure.           High blood pressure: About 90 percent of middle-aged Americans will develop     high blood pressure in their lifetime, and nearly 70 percent of people with     high blood pressure do not have it under control. Of the estimated 50 million     Americans with high blood pressure, 31.6 percent are unaware of their     condition. (94)          High cholesterol: About 40.6 million Americans have cholesterol levels of     240 mg/dL or above, which is considered high risk. Meanwhile, a 10 percent     decrease in cholesterol levels may result in an estimated 30 percent reduction     in the incidence of coronary heart disease. (95)          Tobacco use: About 1 in 5 deaths from CVD are attributable to smoking.     Age-adjusted prevalence rates for Americans 18 and older  in 2000 show     that 27.1 percent of men and 22.2 percent of women are smokers. The World     Health Organization estimates that one year after quitting, the risk of coronary     heart disease decreases by 50 percent, and within 15 years, the relative     risk of dying from CHD for an ex-smoker approaches that of a lifetime nonsmoker.     The risk of death from coronary heart disease increases by up to 30 percent     among those exposed to  environmental  tobacco smoke at home or at     work. (96)          Poor diet leading to overweight and obesity: Using BMI definitions, more     than 129 million adults are overweight or obese and 61 million are in the     obese category of BMI.  (97)  In addition,     an estimated 5 million children are considered     overweight. (98)          Physical inactivity: The relative risk of coronary heart disease associated     with physical inactivity ranges from 1.5 to 2.4, an increase in risk comparable     to that observed for high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, or     smoking. (99)         The Costs of Cardiovascular Disease      The costs of CVD have steadily increased past the $300 billion dollar mark over the past three years. The first comprehensive economic analysis based on 2000 Census data, performed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and the American Heart Association (AHA), estimated the total cost of the disease to be $298.2 billion for the year 2001. (100)  Subsequent updates to this analysis gave an estimated total cost of $329.2 billion for 2002 and $351.8 billion for 2003. (101) , (102)         Figure 6.  Source of data: Refs. 100, 101, 102.    The NHLBI/AHA studies of CVD evaluated both direct costs (physician services, hospital and nursing home services, medications, home healthcare, and other durables) and indirect costs of lost productivity resulting from morbidity and mortality (days of work lost due to absence from work or premature death). For the year 2003, these cost categories totaled $209.3 billion and $142.5 billion, respectively. Direct medical care costs covered approximately 66 million physician office visits and 7 million outpatient department visits and over 4 million emergency department visits.  (103)  CVD ranks highest among all disease categories in hospital discharges. Given the age effects of CVD, it poses a substantial economic burden on Medicare: in 1999, $26.3 billion in payments were made to hospitals for Medicare beneficiaries' expenses due to cardiovascular problems. That was an average of $7,883 per discharge.  (104)    The indirect costs of CVD are also substantial; most of these costs are due to lost productivity and are borne by employers. According to the CDC, if all forms of major CVD were eliminated, life expectancy would rise by almost 7 years. The same study indicates that the probability at birth of dying from major CVD is 47 percent. While death rates from CVD have declined over the past ten years, actual (absolute) deaths have increased over the same period of time.  (105)  Great strides have been made in the treatment of CVD, but treatment can only be part of the solution. An estimated 3 million Americans ages 35-64 who are currently free of coronary heart disease will develop the disease in the next ten years in the absence of intervention to reduce risk factors.  (106)       ASTHMA      Asthma is an obstructive lung disease caused by an inflammatory reaction and hyperreactivity of the airways to various triggers. Inflammation and bronchospasm of the airways restricts airflow into and out of the lungs. Asthma is characterized by periodic attacks of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing. In sensitive individuals, asthma symptoms can be triggered by inhaled allergens (allergy triggers), such as pet dander, dust mites, cockroach allergens, molds, or pollens. Symptoms of asthma can also be triggered by respiratory                          Northeast Utilities         The goal of Northeast Utilities' WellAware program is to improve the health  and well-being of employees and families through participation in targeted  programs and services that address lifestyle-related health risks; and to  reduce health care costs. Northeast Utilities found that almost 17% of its  health care claims were attributable to modifiable, lifestyle behaviors.  Key features of the program include: financial incentives for participation,  employees and spouses eligible, strong senior management support, and ongoing  evaluation and re-design.     The components of the program include: a health risk assessment which is  the ""ticket"" into program, a telephonic high risk intervention, a secondary  coronary artery disease management program, telephonic smoking cessation  counseling and rebate for purchasing smoking cessation aids, integration  with internal departments (health units, safety, EAP) and external partners  (health plans, local hospitals, etc.), accessible via on-site programs,  communication of community programs, guidebooks, videos, and telephonic  intervention programs, Internet site allows access at work and home, and  a toll free hotline for materials and questions.     In its first 24 months, Northeast Utilities documented a 1.6 return on investment  from the WellAware program, including a $1,400,000 reduction in lifestyle  and behavioral claims and flat per capita costs for health care. Participants  in the program demonstrated a reduction in health risk factors including  a 31% decrease in smoking, a 29% decrease in lack of exercise, a 16% decrease  in mental health risk, a 11% decrease in cholesterol risk, an 10% improvement  in eating habits, and a 5% decrease in stress.

The goals of Pfizer's   Employee Health and Wellness  stategy are to assist Pfizer to attract  and retain best people; increase productivity; enhance employee and dependent  health by primary, secondary, tertiary prevention; effectively manage health  care resources; and help employees and dependents be informed and efficient  health care consumers. Pfizer's  Employee Health and Wellness  strategy  is a multi-dimensional, highly integrated approach with on-site administration  and access. It includes: health risk assessment/identification initiatives,  wellness and health education initiatives, disease management initiatives,  medical clinics, fitness centers, on-site physical therapy, a ergonomics  program, managed disability program, welfare benefits/health care delivery  evaluation/enhancement intiatives, and an Employee Assistance Program.     In Pfizer's New York location, 85% of employees participate in one or more  programs, and 80% of employees use on-site health services. Over 41% (1,850  members) of the total population participates in the fitness center at this  site, with waiting list of 250 for enrollment. The Premier Employer Program  is promoted via communication and education to employees delivered via a  variety of media. Print materials, on-site communication, and intranet/internet  access to information on the health management program ensures that employees  have access to information regarding program initiatives. These media also  provide up-to-date information on health risk reduction. New initiatives  are added as needs are reassessed and program effectiveness evaluated. Pfizer's  research staff measures the impact of initiatives and analyzes the  cost-effectiveness and return on investment.     Pfizer's ergonomics program demonstrated a return on investment (ROI) of  3.51 to 1 and a net savings of $1,153,206 for participants. The physical  therapy program generated an average ROI of 3.61 to 1 (2001), and produced  over $579,000 in savings related to employee lost time avoided by on-site  access to services. In 1998, the ROI for the fitness centers program was  4.29 to 1.

Currently, asthma is the 6 th -ranking chronic condition among the general American population in terms of prevalence and the leading serious chronic illness of children in the U.S.      The Prevalence of Asthma      Three metrics are used to describe asthma prevalence:           Lifetime prevalence, which indicates how many individuals in the population     have been diagnosed with asthma at least once in his or her lifetime         Current prevalence, which indicates how many individuals in the population     are currently diagnosed with asthma in a given year         Attack prevalence, which indicates how many individuals in the population     have had an asthma attack in a given year     The most recent data available, from 2001, show a lifetime prevalence rate of 113.4 per 1000 persons for the overall United States population. Approximately 22.2 - 23.2 million adults and 9.1 million children have been diagnosed with asthma at some point within their lifetime, giving a composite estimate of about 31.3 - 32.3 million Americans who have had or currently have asthma. Recently, children (ages 5-17) have displayed the highest lifetime prevalence rates; in 2001, the lifetime prevalence rate was 144.2 per 1000 children. Females have a 10 percent higher lifetime prevalence rate than males. (107)    The current prevalence rate for 2001--the ratio of the U.S. population who actually had asthma during that year--was estimated to be 73.4 per 1000 persons, or about 20.3 million Americans. The highest current prevalence was observed in those 5-17 years of age at a rate of 98.1 per 1000 persons. The current prevalence rate in females, at 82.6 per 1000 persons, was 30 percent higher than that for males, at 63.6 per 1000 persons. This pattern was reversed in children: the current asthma prevalence rate for boys was 30 percent higher than for girls (ages 0-17). (108)                       Prevalence of Asthma By Gender, 2001                     Age/Gender Category         Asthma Prevalence Rate, 2001 (per 1000 population)                     Girls, ages 0-17         74.4                     Boys, ages 0-17         99.0                     All Females         82.6                     All Males         63.6                     Overall         73.4                     Source:  Trends in Asthma Morbidity and Mortality .  American Lung Association Epidemiology & Statistics Unit. March  2003.                  Within the population suffering from asthma in 2001, approximately 12 million Americans had an asthma attack; of this number, about 4 million were children under 18. The overall asthma attack rate in the general population was 43.4 per 1000 persons in 2001. (109)    Reliable statistical data on asthma prevalence are available from the year 1980 forward. From 1980 to 1996, the number of Americans afflicted with asthma doubled to 15 million, with children under five years of age experiencing the highest rate of increase. (110)  Children (ages 5-17) have had the highest prevalence rates between 1997 and 2001, demonstrating that the asthma epidemic will continue to be a significant health problem for future generations. (111)       The Costs of Asthma      The costs of asthma have increased in step with the rise in asthma prevalence. The first comprehensive economic evaluation of asthma in 1992 estimated the total cost of the disease to be $6.2 billion per year. (112)  A study on the national costs of asthma for the year 1997 estimated those costs at $8 billion-$11 billion. (113)  The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute within the National Institutes of Health estimated that the annual costs of asthma were $11.3 billion per year in 1998. The two most recent analyses of the economic impact of asthma, commissioned by the American Lung Association (ALA) to study asthma costs in 2000 and 2001, cited annual estimates of $12.7 billion and $14 billion, respectively. (114)         Figure 7.  Source of data: NIH/NHLB; Refs. 112, 114.    The ALA study of asthma costs in 2001 evaluated both direct health care costs of asthma (hospital care, physicians' services, and medications) and indirect costs of lost productivity (school days lost, work days lost, and lifetime earnings lost due to mortality). In 2002 dollars, these cost categories totaled $9.4 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively. Direct medical care costs covered approximately 465,000 hospitalizations, 1 million hospital outpatient department visits, 1.8 million emergency room visits, and 10.4 million physician office visits due to asthma each year. (115)  About 1 in 6 pediatric emergency room visits is caused by an asthma attack. (116) ,  (117)  Indirect costs encompass about 14 million lost school days, 14.5 million lost work days, and the productivity loss of the approximately 5,000 people who die from asthma each year. Asthma is the most common reason for school absence--this specific indirect cost alone results in an estimated $1 billion annual productivity loss. (118)    The financial burden of asthma is borne heavily by patients and their families. Out-of-pocket expenses for asthma are estimated at roughly 25 percent of total medical costs compared to the average of 10 percent for medical expenses for all illnesses. (119)  The average family in the U.S. spends between 5.5 percent and 14.5 percent of its total income on treating an asthmatic child. (120)  However, employers are not impervious to this cost burden. Annual per capita employer expenditures for asthmatic patients were approximately 2.5 times those for control subjects ($5,385/employee versus $2,121/employee). For asthmatic employees, wage-replacement costs for workdays lost as a result of disability and absenteeism accounted for almost as much as did medical care (40 percent versus 43 percent). (121)    As indicated above, both prevalence and costs of asthma have increased markedly over the past decade and a half. While there is no consensus as to why asthma prevalence has increased, scientists studying the phenomenon have postulated that obesity and lack of physical exercise, dietary changes, and increased exposure to indoor allergens are among the reasons for the increase. (122)  The growth in costs of asthma is largely due to the increase in asthma prevalence: prevalence rates increased by nearly 70 percent from 1986 to 1996, far outpacing the 12 percent growth in population. Average costs for asthma per capita actually decreased over this period, despite the significant increase in absolute costs. (123)  That is, while treatments have become more cost-effective, total costs have still ballooned because of the greater proportion of the population with asthma. This indicates that, in order to contain asthma costs in the future, better treatments must be supplemented with prevention strategies aimed at reducing asthma prevalence.      TOBACCO USE      Efforts to promote smoking cessation have the potential to prevent substantial mortality and morbidity in this country. Over the past several decades, strong scientific evidence has emerged that smoking is addictive and has serious health consequences. (124)       The Prevalence of Smoking      Recent prevalence estimates indicate that over 46 million (or approximately 23.5 percent) of adults in this country are current smokers - those who smoke every day or almost every day. Smoking rates tend to be somewhat higher among males, individuals between the ages of 18 and 44, and American Indians. Among adolescents, prevalence estimates are generally comparable to those of adults, with approximately 28.5 percent of high school students reporting that they are current smokers. (125)  Approximately 80 percent of adult smokers started smoking before the age of 18. According to the 2001 NHSDA, 4,400 young people between the ages of 12-17 years try their first cigarette each day. (126)    Despite these figures, it is encouraging to note that the majority of smokers (approximately 70 percent) have made at least one prior attempt to quit smoking, and between one-third to one-half of all smokers (34 to 46 percent) attempt to quit each year. However, very few of these individuals (approximately 2.5 percent) actually succeed in quitting. The high rate of relapse is largely attributable to the nicotine dependence that most smokers develop. (127)  In fact, over 85 percent of current smokers acknowledge that cigarettes are addictive. (128)       The Effects of Smoking           Figure 8.  Source of data: Refs. 125.    Tobacco use is the single most preventable risk factor for death and disease, contributing to more than 440,000 premature deaths annually in the United States during 1995 through 1999.    This figure represents one out of every five deaths each year being associated with tobacco use, ranking tobacco use as the number one health problem contributing to death and disability in the U.S. Tobacco use is a risk factor for chronic lung disease, heart disease, stroke, and several forms of cancer, specifically cancer of the lungs, larynx, esophagus, mouth and bladder. (129) , (130)  Additionally, research indicates that smoking contributes to cancer of the cervix, pancreas and kidneys. (131)  Shorter-term effects of smoking include increased heart rate and blood pressure, coughing with phlegm or blood, shortness of breath when not exercising, wheezing or gasping, and reported poorer overall health. (132)    The harmful effects of smoking do not appear limited only to those who use tobacco. Pregnant women who smoke are more likely to produce low birth weight babies and infants with a variety of health disorders, including those with an increased risk of death from sudden infant death syndrome and respiratory distress. In addition, an estimated 3,000 nonsmoking Americans die each year from lung cancer, and up to 300,000 children have respiratory tract infections due to increased susceptibility after exposure to secondhand smoke. (133)    An international analysis estimates that roughly half of all adolescents who try smoking will become life-long smokers, and of this group, one in two will die as a result of smoking. (134)  Unfortunately, the mortality rates from smoking suggest that given the current prevalence of smoking among adolescents, it can be expected that 6.4 million individuals under the age of 18 will die prematurely as a result of tobacco-related diseases. (135)       The Costs of Smoking      The direct and indirect economic costs associated with tobacco use are significant. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), the direct and indirect costs of smoking are estimated at $138 billion per year. (136)  As with other chronic conditions, employers are significantly affected by the indirect costs of the health problems that result from tobacco use. An extensive review of the literature published in 2001 found solid evidence that 6 to 14 percent of personal health care expenditures could be attributed to smoking, and that smokers had greater medical costs over the course of their lifetimes. The review also found a large number of studies that demonstrated that smokers are more costly to their employers than those employees who do not smoke. (137)  The economic costs of smoking are estimated to be about $3,391 per smoker per year. Each pack of cigarettes sold in the United States costs the nation an estimated $7.18 in medical care costs and lost productivity. (138)  Roughly 14 percent of all Medicaid expenditures are for smoking related illnesses, (139)  and more than $20 billion of Medicare expenditures each year are related to smoking. (140)       Treatment and Prevention      Efforts to promote smoking cessation have the potential to prevent substantial mortality and morbidity in the U.S. One year after quitting, a person's additional risk of heart disease is reduced by half, and after 15 years, this risk equals that of a person who never smoked. Within 10 years of quitting smoking a former smoker's risk of developing lung cancer is 30 to 50 percent below that of a current smoker. The benefits are even greater for individuals who quit smoking before the age of 50. Their risk of dying in the next 15 years is half that of a person who smokes. (141)    Tobacco dependence is a chronic condition that often requires repeated intervention. However, effective treatments do exist that can produce long-term or even permanent abstinence. Three types of counseling and behavioral therapies have been found to be especially effective in treating patients attempting tobacco cessation: practical counseling (problem solving/skills training); social support as part of treatment; and help in securing social support outside of treatment. (142)  A number of smoking cessation treatments currently exist including over-the-counter medications (nicotine patches, nicotine gum), behavioral modification techniques, self-help efforts, and prescription medications (tablet, inhalers, nasal sprays).   A number of studies have examined the cost savings from tobacco prevention programs. The State of California estimates that their statewide tobacco prevention program resulted in an overall cost savings of $8.4 billion from the years 1990-1998. This program included a statewide mass media campaign and community programs designed and implemented by local health departments, community coalitions, community-based organizations, and regional and statewide agency networks. (143)  Over the course of the statewide program, $3.62 in direct medical costs were avoided for every $1 spent on the program. Reducing smoking prevalence among pregnant women by one percentage point over seven years would prevent 57,200 low birth weight deliveries and save $572 million. Another study estimated that every $1 invested in certain types of school-based tobacco prevention programs saves $19.90 in associated medical costs. The economic benefits of prevention are also apparent for employers: an economic assessment found that a health care plan's annual cost of covering treatment to help people quit smoking ranged from $0.89 to $4.92 per smoker, whereas the annual cost of treating smoking-related illness ranged from $6.00 to $33.00 per smoker. (144)       BUSINESSES AND OTHER EMPLOYERS PROMOTING HEALTH AND   DISEASE PREVENTION      Employers have become increasingly aware that overweight and obesity, lack of physical activity, and smoking have a major impact not only on the health and productivity of their employees, but also on the financial ""health"" of their businesses. Since the 1970s, many employers have provided a variety of health promotion and disease prevention programs to their employees. These efforts often have focused on overweight and obesity, physical activity, and smoking, as well as other behaviors and conditions (such as depression and stress) linked to the health and well-being of their employees. The motivation behind these programs is to improve the health status of employees, increase the productivity and morale of employees and reduce absenteeism, and reduce business costs that are associated with chronic diseases and disorders among employees. Throughout this report, a small number of noteworthy businesses' health promotion and disease prevention programs along with their key features have been highlighted. (145)  These particular companies have won national awards for their health programs, and are presented in this report because they illustrate some of the promising approaches to promoting wellness among employees that many companies across the country are operating. (146)    The proportion of employers who provide such programs has increased over the years, and it is reported that health improvement programs of some kind now are being offered by over 80 percent of worksites with 50 or more employees and almost all large employers with more than 750 employees. (147)  The focus and scope of these efforts vary substantially across companies. Some worksite programs may focus on a single risk factor, such as smoking, or a particular disease, such as CVD, while others may focus on a much wider set of risk factors and diseases. (148)  Employers offer a wide variety of resources that differ considerably in comprehensiveness, intensity, and duration, and the extent to which they tie together health promotion and disease prevention activities with employee health benefits, occupational health, employee assistance programs, disease management, workers' compensation, disability benefits, and other benefit programs. (149)  Clearly, small businesses face a much greater challenge in implementing practical, affordable efforts to improve their employees' health. Future research and public policies will need to address the special needs of small employers.   One survey of more than 1,000 U.S. employers (most of which had more than 1,000 employees) found that 72 percent provided education or training on lifestyle behaviors to their employees, and 40 percent offered financial incentives for participation in health appraisals or screenings. (150)  Department of Labor data show that in 2000, 18 percent of all employees (including part-time) were eligible for wellness programs, and 9 percent were eligible for fitness center programs. (151)    Given the large number of companies that have implemented health promotion and disease prevention programs, many for several decades now, it is not surprising that a large amount of information has been reported on the effects of these programs on employee health and productivity, and on the costs and benefits of these programs to the companies that sponsor them. Moreover, many companies and studies have reported that these kinds of programs have had positive effects on employee health and job performance, and have resulted in cost savings for the companies that provide them. The nature and quality of this information vary a great deal, since these programs generally were not designed to be research studies. Many of the available reports are case studies. When more systematic studies are undertaken, they often must address limitations that include selection bias, skewed data, confounding variables, small sample sizes, and lack of control or comparison groups. (152)  These limitations in turn make it difficult for studies of worksite programs to attribute a causal relationship between the program and the measured effects and to generalize the findings to other locations, businesses, or workforces. (153)         Figure 9. Source of data: Ref. 150.    A number of comprehensive reviews, or meta-analyses, have analyzed findings across large numbers of individual studies of worksite health promotion and disease prevention programs in the recent years. (154) , (155) , (156) , (157) , (158)  These and other reviews categorize and examine a broad array of worksite programs, and provide in-depth information and conclusions about many aspects of health promotion and disease prevention activities and their effects on employees and businesses. While these reviews provide information that is too extensive and detailed to be adequately summarized in this brief discussion, they provide a strong indication that many health promotion and disease prevention programs  do  work and  do  result in significant cost savings.   Many studies have focused specifically on the return on investment (ROI) from worksite health promotion and disease prevention programs. One recent review identified well-conducted, rigorous evaluation studies of ROI, then documented the range of ROI estimates in these studies, and examined the factors that influenced program outcomes and ROI estimates. (159)  Findings on the return on investment for health promotion and disease management programs were reported for nine employers: Canada & North America Life; Chevron; City of Mesa, AZ; General Mills; General Motors; Johnson & Johnson; Pacific Bell; Procter & Gamble; and Tenneco. These programs provide health education to their employees to promote behaviors that will improve health or prevent disease, and typically include exercise programs, health-risk appraisal, weight control, nutrition information, stress management, disease screening, and smoking cessation. (160)  The review found significant return on investment for the programs provided by these nine employers, with the range of benefit-to-cost ratios, ranging from $1.49 to $4.91 in benefits per dollar spent on the program, and a median of $3.14. For instance, at the high end, General Motors realized at one of their sites an annual savings of $105.50 in total health care costs per enrollee for an annual program cost of $27 per enrollee-a ratio of 4.91 of benefits-to-cost.   These reviewers also examined what they call ""demand-management programs,"" or programs that encourage and help employees increase the use of self-care and decrease their use of medical care, often through self-care books, newsletters, telephone information lines, counseling, and other means. Looking at studies of ROI for demand-management programs (Blue Shield of California, five California counties, Group Health, Rhode Island Group Health Association, and United Health Care), they found greater variation in the return on investment in these kinds of programs, ranging from $2.19 to $13 in benefits per dollar spent. They also examined three studies of ROI for disease-management programs and found a range in benefit-to-cost ratios from $7.33 to $10.38. For multiple category programs that combined elements of these programs, they found a range of $5.47 to $6.47 in benefits per dollar spent.                           CIGNA         The goal of CIGNA's Working Well Program is to keep its 34,000 U.S. employees  healthy and at work. The Working Well Program's annual budget is $2.5 million.  The program is implemented at all 250 domestic offices. Working Well has  a broad range of programs for all employees with special emphasis on issues  of concern to women who make up 76% of CIGNA's employees.     The  Working Well Moms Program  encourages and supports breast-feeding.  Over three-quarters of CIGNA women are of childbearing age. Breast feeding  duration rates for participants are 72% at 6 months and 36% at 12 months,  significantly higher than control groups and U.S. data. This has decreased  pharmacy costs - 62% fewer prescriptions for breast-fed children. The program  has also contributed to decreased medical costs - a savings of $240,000 in  healthcare expenses. In addition, program participants have 74 fewer absences  per 100 mothers, a savings of $60,000 in lost time annually.     The  Working Well Triumph Program  provides skill training and support  for disabled employees to improve their health, adopt healthy lifestyles,  and reduce the likelihood of future disability leave. This program has resulted  in healthcare costs savings of more than $900 per program participant.     The  Working Well Flu Shots Program  provides free immunization  inoculations at all significant employee locations. The program is aimed  at reducing workplace absenteeism. Program participants has 29% less absenteeism  as compared to employees not getting a shot. This produced a savings of $33  per employee participant. The overall return on investment for the program  was 3 to 1.     CIGNA's smoking cessation program, which combines behavioral counseling and  pharmacologic treatment, is offered to all CIGNA employees and their  benefits-eligible family members who want to quit smoking. The program helped  67 percent of its participants quit smoking after 12 months, a quit rate  up to three times higher than comparable smoking cessation programs. CIGNA  estimates saving $949 in health care costs for each successful participant,  a return on investment of 9.5 to 1.     To contact CIGNA for more detailed information, see:   www.Cigna.com .                For these employers, disease management programs resulted in the highest returns on investment, and the educational health promotion and disease prevention programs the lowest returns. Moreover, the more expensive programs resulted in lower returns on investment than some of the less expensive ones. The reviewers suggest the possibility that the higher costs may stem from the larger capital investments that go into on-site fitness centers or classroom-based education programs. They also point out that the typical health promotion and disease prevention program provides health education to most or all employees but usually shows savings for only a small portion of the neediest employees, whereas disease management programs are targeted on a smaller selected group of employees. They conclude that, in designing effective programs that will improve employee health and productivity and produce good returns on investment, employers should consider an array of health and productivity programs (rather than focus on the ""pure"" wellness program) and integrate them with health and demand-management or disease-management activities. (161)    Most of the information on the costs, effects, and benefits of corporate health promotion and disease prevention programs has come from studies of relatively short time periods, e.g., two years or less. Relatively little information is available on the long-term effects of such programs on the health status of employees and their utilization of health care services, and the return on investment over these longer periods. One recent study examined the long-term impact of the Johnson & Johnson Health & Wellness Program on medical care and expenditures. (162)  Johnson & Johnson has offered a health promotion program since 1979 and has spent several million dollars on evaluations of the program. According to this study, the Johnson & Johnson program integrates employee health, wellness, disability management, employee assistance, and occupational medicine programs, and places considerable emphasis on health promotion and disease prevention. The study looked at up to five years of data and found that, while there was a slight increase in emergency department expenditures per employee per year ($10.87), there also were significant decreases in expenditures for outpatient and office visits ($45.17), mental health visits ($70.69), and inpatient hospital days ($119.67). Across all of these categories, total savings were $224.66 per employee per year. Moreover, the study found a substantial increase in savings in years 3 and 4 for outpatient and physician visits and inpatient days. While these researchers caution that a variety of methodological limitations make it difficult to definitively establish causality for the observed effects and savings, and to be certain about the exactness of the savings for each of the health outcome categories, they suggest that a more in-depth and comprehensive analysis would likely show that the total program savings were even greater, and they conclude:      This study demonstrates that a well-conceived health and wellness program   that focuses on prevention, self-care, risk factor reduction, and disease   management can produce substantial benefits for employers and their employees.   Utilization and expenditures may be reduced by better coordination of existing   health and productivity management programs, with many of these benefits   occurring in later years. (163)         CONCLUSION      There is clear evidence that the costs of chronic conditions are enormous, as are the potential savings from preventing them, even if there may not always be agreement on the exact amounts of these costs and savings. Since a large part of the root cause of chronic conditions involves attitudes and behavioral choices, the prospect of reducing their prevalence appears daunting and promising at the same time. Attitudes and behaviors may be resistant to change, even when the desire to change is there. Moreover, people often encounter significant barriers in their social and physical environments. On the other hand, the actions that would eliminate much of the morbidity and mortality in our country are clear, and to a large extent these are practicable measures that the average person can take. By changing the way they live, Americans could change their personal health status and the health landscape of the Nation dramatically. Americans could save themselves, their employers, and the Nation substantial amounts of money if they took certain measures that are well-understood and relatively modest in scope. Even though some efforts over the last several decades to educate individuals about ways to improve their health and prevent disease have had limited influence on large proportions of our population, others have been very successful. Public and private policies need to focus on sustained efforts to encourage positive behaviors, building on proven, successful models. Key to these efforts is the recognition that the worksite is a place that can be conducive to good health.   The stakes are so great that the challenge must be met. It is ironic that in this day of high-tech, complex, and costly medical procedures and treatments, simple, inexpensive, easily-understood actions, such as increasing physical activity, controlling weight, and quitting smoking, could have such a huge impact on the quality of life and the cost of health care. While there always will be legitimate debate over the costs and benefits of particular health promotion and disease prevention endeavors, the Nation simply cannot afford  not  to step up efforts to reverse the growing prevalence of chronic disorders. Resources and energy need to be marshaled in all sectors and at all levels of society-federal, state, tribal, and local governments, foundations, associations, health care providers and insurers, businesses, communities, schools, families, and individuals-to control and prevent the chronic conditions that threaten the Nation's physical and financial well-being.

GX009-82-12575384	"Return to the  Midwifery Program Home Page                   History of Midwifery in Texas                   Prior to the modern era of specialization in medicine -- particularly            in prenatal care -- there was always a woman in the village, the small            town, or somewhere in the family that people went to for sore throats,            who knew a lot about herbs and home remedies, and who was willing to            assist in the birth of a baby.  Parteras  serving the Spanish speaking            population and ""granny ladies"" in rural Texas are part of the traditional            folklore and cultural legacy of Texas history, from the time of the            Texas Republic and before. In 1925, more than 50 percent of the babies            born in Texas were delivered by midwives. This reflected the rural and            working poor population in Texas, among whom low income was a barrier            to institutional medical care.            Historically, Acts of the legislature regarding such public health            practices as eye care at birth, registration of birth, detection of            sexually transmitted disease, and newborn screening for phenylketonuria            or diabetes, have recognized midwives as practitioners. Yet prior to            1983, Texas did not regulate midwives. However, two cities along the            Texas-Mexico border, where economic conditions and tradition made lay            midwifery a widely accepted practice, adopted municipal ordinances requiring            a permit to practice lay midwifery. In  Banti v Texas, 1956 , a            midwife was accused of practicing medicine without a license (the baby            was stillborn) and unlawfully treating the mother ""for a disease and            physical disorder"". Mrs. Banti argued that childbirth is not a disease            or a disorder, but nevertheless was convicted by the local court. However,            on appeal, the court overturned the conviction because the state legislature            had ""not defined the practice of medicine so as to include the act of            assisting women in parturition or childbirth"".            In 1983, the Texas legislature passed the Texas Midwifery Act, because            of rising concern among legislators over the lack of regulation of dorect            entrymidwives. (Certified Nurse Midwives are regulated under the  Texas            State Board of Nurse Examiners .) Please see additional information            on  our home page  regarding the Texas Midwifery            Board, which regulates documented midwives, including the Texas MDiwifery            Act and Midwifery Rules.                           Birth certificates must be registered with the county clerk in the county          of birth or residence within 5 days. Only midwives who are documented          with TDH are authorized to obtain birth certificates and file them with          the clerk.                   As prescribed by Texas law, the direct entry midwife:                            Assists only in normal childbirth             Does not perform Caesarean sections;            Does not use forceps or surgical instruments for any procedure other            than cutting the umbilical cord or providing emergency first aid during            delivery;            Does not perform an episiotomy;            Does not remove the placenta by invasive techniques;            Does not advance or retard labor or delivery by using medicines or            mechanical devices;            Does not assist at childbirth other than normal childbirth except            in an emergency situation that poses an immediate threat to the life            of the mother or newborn;            Does not administer a prescription drug except as an agent of a physician            licensed by the State of Texas.

Leigh, PhD (Senior Research Associate) and Maren A. Jimenez (Research Assistant) of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies. The authors gratefully acknowledge the institutional support of the Joint Center, and, in particular, the ""fresh pair of eyes"" provided by Julia L. Andrews (Research Assistant), who helped with proofreading and preparing the reference lists.   FOREWORD  This edition of the Women of Color Health Data Book provides the most recent available information on different populations of women in the United States and represents a much desired update on the health of women of color. The first edition quickly became one of the most popular documents requested from this office. In fact, the first run was depleted in less than six months. Originally published in 1997, this second edition of the Women of Color Health Data Book includes more information and updated statistics. The standards have been revised to include five minimum racial categories: American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and white. Ethnicity is reported as either ""Hispanic or Latino"" or ""Not Hispanic or Latino."" Whenever possible, the population labels and presentation of data in this volume conform to the recent revisions to Statistical Policy Directive No. 15, Race and Ethnic Standards for Federal Statistics and Administrative Reporting. These revisions were issued for comment by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in the mid-1990s, and their final version guided the data collection in the 2000 census. The new race/ethnicity terminology is to be adopted by other federal entities as soon as possible but not later than January 1, 2003. This edition of the Women of Color Health Data Book continues to support recognition of the importance of women's health and, more specifically, the role of culture, ethnicity, race, socioeconomic background, geographic location, and other social and economic factors as important contributors to health status. The expanded concepts of women's health, and therefore research, focus on the study and understanding of women's health as a reflection of the myriad of elements that contribute to the overall quality of women's lives in the United States today. In 1985, the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) published the Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Black and Minority Health, which documented disparate disease prevalence, progression, and health outcomes, including excessively high mortality rates, for minorities from many conditions that effect all  segments of the U.S. population. Following that were many organizations both within and outside the federal government to address the health of minority women. The Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, which prepared this report, first published data on the health of minority women in its 1992 report, A Health Assessment of Black Americans: A Fact Book, and has been among the most effective organizations working to focus our nation's attention on these issues. The closing years of the 20th century were characterized by increased attention to women's health issues, resulting in the establishment of federal offices, programs, legislation, and policies to foster the study of women's health issues and to promote the broader inclusion of women and minorities in biomedical research. These changes reflect the recognition that, in order for the results of biomedical and behavioral research to be widely applicable, researchers and clinicians must understand how cultural, ethnic, and racial differences may influence the causes, diagnoses, progression, treatment, and outcomes of diseases among different populations, including women of diverse geographic locations and economic backgrounds. This data book will be of value to scientists, advocates, and policy makers in understanding the health status of women of color in this country in order to formulate policies and research priorities to improve the health of all women in the United States. The challenge inherent in women's health research is to establish a scientific knowledge base that will permit reliable diagnoses and effective prevention and treatment strategies for all women, including those of diverse cultural and ethnic origins, geographic locations, and economic status. The ultimate goal is to increase medical knowledge through sound science and thereby to inform the development of policies and medical standards from which all women--and men--can benefit equally. Just as sex and gender constitute parameters that must be incorporated in the design of clinical research studies if the results of such research are to be widely applied through health care policies and interventions, so too must racial, ethnic, and cultural factors be taken into account in the design and implementation of research protocols.  iii   WOMEN  OF  COLOR  HEALTH  DATA  BOOK  iv  Over the past two decades, evolving scientific, public, and political perceptions have led to policies that mandate broader inclusion of both women and men of diverse backgrounds in clinical research studies. The need for a better understanding of if--and how-- sex, gender, cultural, and racial differences influence the pathobiology, etiology, diagnosis, progression, treatment, and outcome of diseases among different populations has also resulted in changes in research topics and strategies. Policies for the inclusion of women and minorities in clinical research funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have their origins in the women's health movement. The publication of a report by the Public Health Service Task Force on Women's Health in 1985 prompted NIH to promulgate a policy urging the inclusion of women in clinical research. Later, in 1987, minority and other scientists at NIH recognized the need to address the inclusion of minority populations. So, in a later 1987 version of the NIH Guide, a policy encouraging the inclusion of minorities in clinical studies was first published. Following the release of a 1990 General Accounting Office report documenting problems with the implementation of this policy and the subsequent establishment of the Office of Research on Women's Health in September 1990, this inclusion policy was strengthened and expanded. The NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 (Public Law 103-43) legislatively mandated the inclusion of women and members of minority groups in all research studies supported by NIH, thus superseding and expanding previous policies. The resulting modifications to the NIH guidelines on inclusion, published in March 1994, require that women and minorities and their subpopulations be included in all human subject research supported by NIH; that women and minorities and their subpopulations be included in Phase III clinical trials in numbers adequate to allow for valid analyses of differences in intervention effect; that cost is not allowed as an acceptable reason for excluding these groups; and, that NIH initiate programs and support for outreach efforts to recruit and retain women and minorities and their subpopulations as volunteers in clinical studies. While the guidelines require inclusion,  they also recognize that inclusion must be determined by science. Depending on the scientific issues under study, not every investigation requires the inclusion of every minority group, or even in some instances, both sexes. Most important, researchers have the opportunity to gather information on women and minorities when hypotheses are being formulated, thereby allowing for the variables of gender, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic background to be taken into account while studies are being designed, and to design such studies, as appropriate, to allow for analysis by sex and gender. Although investigators are now required by public law to include women and minority groups as subjects in clinical research, NIH recognizes that there are other barriers to overcome in recruiting and retaining women of diverse backgrounds as research subjects. Such barriers include the need for cultural diversity among researchers, closer relationships between researchers and the communities to be studied, overcoming significant logistical problems related to women's roles as care givers and as salaried workers, and an appreciation of differences in cultural beliefs of potential participants. The Office of Research on Women's Health is addressing these barriers through a number of programs and activities, of which this report is just one. Vivian W.

These include the physical and social environments (especially for American Indians/Alaska Natives, Latinos, and blacks), linguistic isolation (especially Asian Americans, Latinos, and Native Hawaiians or Other Pacific Islanders), and racism (especially blacks and Asian Americans). Although women of color generally have shorter life expectancies than white women, selected populations of Asian women (Japanese, Filipino, and Chinese in both Hawaii and California) and Hispanic women (in California and Puerto Rico) report the longest life expectancies among women, equaling or exceeding that of white women. American Indian/Alaska Native and black American women report the shortest life expectancies. Despite declining death rates from heart disease over the past 50 years, diseases of the heart remain the major cause of death for all females, except Asian and Pacific Islander females, for whom they are the second major cause of death. In addition to heart disease, other prominent causes of death for women of color are: cancers (especially for blacks), diabetes mellitus (all women of color), cerebrovascular diseases (especially American Indians/Alaska Natives), unintentional injuries, and HIV/AIDS (especially black women). Obesity, a problem for many women of color, is related in part to sedentary lifestyles and ""diets of poverty"" (high in fat and low in fruits and vegetables) and contributes to the development of both diabetes and heart disease. American Indian, Native Hawaiian, American Samoan, and black women are the most likely to be overweight or obese.  s  Cigarette smoking among black females of all ages has declined since the late 1980s, although smoking has increased slightly among younger Hispanic and Asian American women over this period. Between 1997 and 1999, American Indian/Alaska Native women (32 percent) reported the highest smoking rate, followed by black women (21 percent) and Latinas (13 percent). Most new cases of AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) among women are reported among African American and Hispanic women. Eighty percent of the new cases reported among women in 2000 were among these two subpopulations that together constitute only 25 percent of all women. The incidence of low- and very-low-birthweight infants varies considerably by the race/ethnicity of the mothers of the infants. For example, in 1999, non-Hispanic black mothers were most likely to give birth to low-birthweight infants (13 percent of live births to these mothers), while Chinese mothers were least likely to do so (5 percent). Many women of color do not avail themselves of preventive health tests such as Pap smears and breast exams on a regular basis due to a variety of factors (availability of insurance coverage, accessibility of facilities, cultural beliefs, and lack of information). For example, one study found that two-thirds of Asian immigrants in California had never had a Pap smear, and 70 percent had never had a mammogram. People of color were disproportionately represented among the nearly 43 million people without health insurance in 1999. Among the low-income people within each racial/ethnic group, the most likely to be uninsured were Hispanics (44 percent), Asians and Pacific Islanders (42 percent), and blacks (28 percent).  s s  s  ix  s  s  s  s  s   WOMEN  OF  COLOR  HEALTH  DATA  BOOK  s  Although the measured incidence of depression and other mental health problems varies by study and among subpopulations of women of color, a majority of Hispanic, African American, and Asian women in one study reported an unmet need for mental health care in the past year. Collecting data about women of color is problematic, with undercounting, failing to collect data for the subpopulations within each group, and misidentifying women of color being some of the major issues. A greater number of community-based medical facilities with culturally sensitive health care providers are needed to serve women of color.  s  s  x   F A CTORS AFFECTING THE HEAL T H O F WOMEN O F COL OR    FACTORS WOMEN OF  AFFECTING COLOR  THE  HEALTH  OF  Ethnic and Racial Heritage Of the more than 281 million people counted by the 2000 Census as United States residents (as of April 15, 2000), more than half (143,368,343 or 50.9 percent) were women.1 More than 41 million of these were women of color. These 41.4 million women of color were distributed as follows: 43 percent black non-Hispanic, 41 percent Hispanic, nearly 13 percent Asian non-Hispanic, 0.4 percent Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander (non-Hispanic), and 2.5 percent American Indian/Alaska Native (non-Hispanic). Women of color are more than a fourth (nearly 29 percent) of all U.S. women. In raw numbers, there are nearly 18 million black (non-Hispanic) women, slightly more than 17 million Hispanic women, more than 1 million American Indian/Alaska Native (non-Hispanic) women, more than 5.2 million Asian (non-Hispanic) women, and nearly 175,000 Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander (non-Hispanic) women.2 Changes between the 1990 and 2000 censuses in the labeling of racial/ethnic groups and in the number of designations that may be selected have made it difficult to compare population totals between the two years. Allowing respondents to select multiple racial/ethnic classifications in the 2000 Census has resulted in at least two types of totals for each population group. One total is the number of persons who marked a given race only, and the other is the number of persons who indicated either the given race alone or in combination with other races. Having multiple totals for racial/ethnic categories in 2000 means that comparisons of population growth rates between 1990 and 2000 will vary. For example, the American Indian/Alaska Native population increased by nearly 38 percent between 1980 and 1990.3 However, between 1990 and 2000, this population increased either by 26 percent (if one uses the population who selected American Indian/Alaska Native as their only racial designation in 2000) or by 110 percent (if one uses the population who selected American Indian/Alaska Native either as their only racial designation or in combination with other racial designations). Underlying these disparate growth rates are the 1.2 million women who identified themselves solely as American Indians or Alaska Natives versus the 2.1 million women who identified themselves either as American Indian/Alaska Native alone or in combination with some other racial/ethnic group(s).4  Similarly, although the black population increased by 13 percent during the 19801990 decade, between 1990 and 2000 the black population increased by either 16 percent or 22 percent, depending on whether the 2000 count used reflects persons who chose this racial designation alone, or persons who chose this racial designation either alone or in combination with other racial designations. A difference of nearly 1 million women exists between those who designated their race as African American only and those who chose that designation alone or in combination with other racial/ethnic affiliations.4 Despite changes in the definition of some Latino subgroups, Hispanic origin was captured in a consistent manner in both 1990 and 2000. Between 1980 and 1990, the Hispanic population grew by 53 percent; between 1990 and 2000, this population increased by nearly three-fifths (58 percent). Whenever possible, the population labels and presentation of data in this volume conform to the recent revisions to Statistical Policy Directive No. 15, Race and Ethnic Standards for Federal Statistics and Administrative Reporting. These revisions were issued for comment by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in the mid-1990s, and their final version guided the data collection in the 2000 decennial census. The new race/ethnicity terminology is to be adopted by other federal entities as soon as possible but not later than January 1, 2003.5 To the extent that data are not available for some of the population subgroups as defined in OMB Directive 15 (e.g., for Asians separate from Pacific Islanders), the most current data are provided for the groups as available (e.g., Asians and Pacific Islanders jointly). The revised standards have five minimum racial categories: American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and white. Ethnicity is to be reported as either ""Hispanic or Latino"" or ""Not Hispanic or Latino."" ""American Indians or Alaska Natives"" includes persons who trace their origins to any of the indigenous peoples of North and South America (including Central America) and who maintain a tribal affiliation or community attachment. ""Asians"" are persons having their origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent. This includes persons from, for example, Cambodia, China, India,  1   WOMEN  OF  COLOR  HEALTH  DATA  BOOK  TABLE 1 Differences in Population by Race and Ethnicity, 1990 to 2000 1990 Census RACE Total Population American Indian or Alaska Native Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander Black or African American White Asian Some Other Race HISPANIC OR LATINO AND RACE Total Population Hispanic or Latino (of any race) Not Hispanic or Latino American Indian or Alaska Native Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander Black or African American White Asian Some Other Race Number 248,709,873 1,959,234 365,024 29,986,060 199,686,070 6,908,638 9,804,847 Number 248,709,873 22,354,059 226,355,814 1,793,773 325,878 29,216,293 188,128,296 6,642,481 249,093 Percent of Total Population 100.0 0.8 0.1 12.1 80.3 2.8 3.9 Percent of Total Population 100.0 9.0 91.0 0.7 0.1 11.7 75.6 2.7 0.1 Race Alone 281,421,906 2,475,956 398,835 34,658,190 211,460,626 10,242,998 15,359,073 Race Alone 281,421,906 35,305,818 246,116,088 2,068,883 353,509 33,947,837 194,552,774 10,123,169 467,770 2000 Census Percent of Total Population 100.0 0.9 0.1 12.3 75.1 3.6 5.5 Percent of Total Population 100.0 12.5 87.5 0.7 0.1 12.1 69.1 3.6 0.2 Race Alone or in Combination* 281,421,906 4,119,301 874,414 36,419,434 216,930,975 11,898,828 18,521,486 Race Alone or in Combination* 281,421,906 35,305,818 246,116,088 3,444,700 748,149 35,383,751 198,177,900 11,579,494 1,770,645 Percent of Total Population* 100.0 1.5 0.3 12.9 77.1 4.2 6.6 Percent of Total Population* 100.0 12.5 87.5 1.2 0.3 12.6 70.4 4.1 0.6  Source : U.S. Census Bureau.

""Black or African American"" refers to any person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa. Although this group is dominated by descendants of Africans brought to the United States during the slave era, it also includes more recent migrants primarily from Africa and the Carribean. ""Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander"" includes persons who trace their origins to any of the indigenous peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands. The term Native Hawaiian does not include individuals native to the state of Hawaii by virtue of being born there. Pacific Islanders include people with the following origins: Carolinian, Fijian, Kosraean, Melanesian, Micronesian, Northern Mariana Islander, Palauan, Papua New Guinean, Ponapean (Pohnpelan), Polynesian, Solomon Islander, Tahitian, Tarawa Islander, Tokelauan, Tongan, Trukese (Chuukese), and Yapese. ""White"" refers to persons having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa. ""Hispanic or Latino"" refers to a person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American (non-indigenous), or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race. Population totals for Puerto Ricans residing in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico are not included in the total U.S. Latino population; their totals are reported separately.6 In addition to using the five minimum race/ethnic categories designated by OMB, the 2000 Census also reported data for a sixth category ""some other race."" In fact, population totals from both the 1990 and 2000 censuses were provided for the category ""some other race."" In 1990, nearly 4 percent (9.8 million people) of the enumerated population was of ""some other race."" By 2000, this share had increased to 5.5 percent and included nearly 15.4 million people who designated ""some other race"" as their only affiliation. When single  and multiple racial designations both were tabulated, however, 18.5 million people (6.6 percent of the population enumerated in the 2000 census) selected ""some other race."" A majority (60 percent) of the persons who classified themselves as ""some other race"" were Hispanics. This data book does not include findings for persons in this sixth category. In this data book, information for the population subgroups is presented in rough chronological order of the arrival date of any member of the group in what is now the United States. The standard order of presentation is: American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, Hispanic or Latino, black or African American, and Asian. For groups designated by two terms generally accepted as equivalent, such as ""black or African American,"" the two terms are used interchangeably in the text. In addition to the implications for the presentation of data in this volume resulting directly from revisions in the definitions of racial/ethnic groups between the 1990 and 2000 censuses, a change made in the base for age-adjusting health statistics also may influence the assessment of improvements or worsening of health status between different groups. Also in the year 2000, the National Center for Health Statistics changed the standard million population used for age-adjusting from the 1940 United States population age distribution to the 2000 United States population age distribution.7 Changing the standard million population used for age-adjusting thus reflects the current population distribution, which has a larger proportion of persons 65 years of age or older. Age-adjusted rates are calculated by weighting the average of the age-specific rates, using weights determined by the age structure of the population standard. This change in methodology may make it difficult to distinguish between a true decline in a mortality rate, for example, which   FACTORS  AFFECTING  THE  HEALTH  OF  WOMEN  OF  COLOR  represents progress in closing the gaps in health status by race/ethnicity, and a decline associated solely with the shift in the standard million population used. Thus, some of the age-adjusted data in this edition of the Women of Color Health Data Book may differ dramatically from data in the previous edition. These differences, if noted with data that are age-adjusted, may be more ""on paper"" than real.  s  s s  s  the rapid and forced change from a cooperative, clan-based society to a capitalistic and nuclear family-based system; the outlawing of language and spiritual practices; the death of generations of elders to infectious diseases or war; and the loss of the ability to use the land walked by their ancestors for thousands of years.10  American Indians or Alaska Natives The ancestors of the people known today as American Indians/Alaska Natives lived in North America many centuries before Europeans came. Although 12 to 15 million Indians were here when Columbus arrived in 1492, the 2000 Census reported nearly 2.5 million people who classified themselves as American Indian or Alaska Native only and more than 4 million who classified themselves as part American Indian or Alaska Native.1 The 2.5 million who identified as American Indian or Alaska Native alone were nearly half women (1.24 million).4 American Indians/Alaska Natives are constituted as 556 federally recognized tribes.8 Each tribe belongs to one of seven nations (such as the Navajo or Iroquois); 226 of these tribes are in Alaska, while the others are in 34 states in the continental United States.9 Nearly 300 reservations in the lower 48 states and approximately 500 government units in Alaska serve as homes to the tribes.10 The many American Indian/Alaska Native subpopulations are culturally distinctive, diverse, and complex, and are growing more than three times as rapidly than the white population. American Indians/Alaska Natives speak more than 300 distinct languages, which makes their dialects more diverse than the entire IndoEuropean language family.11 This diversity, coupled with their many small population groups scattered throughout the United States, has made it difficult to provide a uniform, readily accessible health care system for American Indians/Alaska Natives. The 1990 Census reported that nearly three-fifths (59 percent) of the 2.2 million American Indians lived in urban areas, in contrast to a somewhat smaller share of Eskimos (50 percent) and a larger share of Aleuts (69 percent).12,13 Others estimate that a third live in urban areas, another third live on reservations, and a third move back and forth between the two.11 Although American Indians/Alaska Natives are culturally diverse to the point that it often becomes meaningless to classify them together for any but the most gross comparisons, their shared experiences include:  These experiences have fostered the development of several characteristics among American Indians/Alaska Natives that influence their behavior when seeking and responding to health care services. Native people are generally strongly autonomous, are non-linear thinkers (especially about time), use indirect communication and styles, and have a historical suspicion of authority.11 Receiving health services via the federal government, as American Indians/Alaska Natives do because of treaty obligations, influences their ability to access and use health care services. The U.S. government has signed more than 800 treaties with tribes, obligating them to maintain a reasonable level of education and health among American Indians/Alaska Natives.11 The Indian Health Service (IHS)--since 1955 a part of the U.S. Public Health Service--provides health care through its clinics and hospitals to all American Indians/Alaska Natives who belong to federally recognized tribes and live on or near the reservations in its 12 service areas. These service areas contain 151 service units (analogous to county or city health departments) that operate hospitals, and health centers and stations.14 Of the 151 units, the 66 administered by the IHS operated 37 hospitals and 107 health centers and stations as of October 1, 1998. The remaining 85 service units operated by American Indian or Alaska Native tribal governments administer 12 hospitals and 394 health centers, stations, and Alaska village clinics. Most IHS facilities are located on American Indian reservations, which most frequently happen to be in rural areas.15 However, 36 Indian-operated urban projects, either health clinics or community services and referrals, provide care for the American Indians/Alaska Natives who live in urban areas and, therefore, have lost eligibility for IHS care near their reservations as the result of living away from them for 180 days.14,16,17 These Indian-operated facilities also serve members of tribes that are not federally recognized, i.e., recognized only by their states.15 Services in urban areas and in nonreservation rural areas often are very limited and uncoordinated.10,17 In 1987, only 41 percent of all American Indians/Alaska Natives included in the 1987 Survey of American  3   WOMEN  OF  COLOR  HEALTH  DATA  BOOK  4  Indians and Alaska Natives (SAIAN) reported having IHS facilities as a source of health care all year.18 An additional 25 percent reported having private coverage and 18 percent reported public coverage throughout the year. The remaining 16 percent indicated that they had some other type of health insurance coverage for part of the year. The SAIAN also found that, among residents of metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), only 24 percent reported the IHS as their form of health insurance throughout the year, with 35 percent of the residents of MSAs stating that they had private coverage.18 The IHS reported its user population for 1997 as more than 1.3 million. This is defined as ""those American Indians and Alaska Natives who used IHS services at least once during the last 3-year period."" More recent information indicates a decline in access by American Indians or Alaska Natives to health care through the IHS. Other sources report much less use of IHS services, including one survey that found only 20 percent of American Indians and Alaska Natives reported use of IHS-administered health care services that year.15,19 Of the American Indian/Alaska Native population not eligible to use IHS health care services (i.e., 80 percent of the total population), 54 percent had job-based health insurance coverage, 17 percent were covered through Medicaid, and 6 percent were covered through some other source of health insurance. The remaining 23 percent did not have health insurance of any kind.15 Geographic disparities in the location of facilities and the small number of facilities in urban areas account in part for urban American Indian women having both greater difficulties in obtaining access to prenatal care and less likelihood of getting such care than either African American or white women.20 For example, there is only one IHS-operated service unit east of the Mississippi River (in the Nashville area-- Cherokee Hospital in North Carolina) to serve all the American Indians from Maine to Florida.21 Although the population eligible for care in the Nashville service area is relatively small--76,587--it is spread across more than 13 states in the Northeast, on the Atlantic seaboard, and on the Gulf Coast.14 In FY 1999, the number of service units within each service area ranged from two in the Tucson area to 26 in the California service area. The following fiscal year (2000) Tucson still had the fewest health centers,3 while the greatest number were in Oklahoma (a total of 38). These were the areas with the smallest and biggest service populations--28,567 and 313,116,  respectively. Furthermore, both California (131,005) and Portland (155,876) had no hospitals, while Aberdeen (100,441) and Phoenix (146,777) each had eight hospitals.14,19 Another barrier to health care access for American Indians/Alaska Natives is a lack of federal funding for the IHS. Although the federal government is obliged by treaty to provide American Indians and Alaska Natives with a reasonable level of health care, the IHS does not guarantee services to its customer population. Instead, it provides services on the basis of federal funding available. In 1999, federal appropriations provided only 59 percent of the funding necessary to run IHS.22 How has the legacy of American Indians/Alaska Natives in this country influenced the health of Indian women? The major legacy of the forced relocation of American Indians throughout the United States has been to place them in communities in which they confront racism and hostility from their non-Native neighbors.23 Forced relocation took place both in the 18301850 period, when tribes were relocated from lands east of the Mississippi River to Oklahoma, and during the period 1945 to 1968, when, in an attempt to mainstream them, American Indians were given one-way transportation by the Bureau of Indian Affairs to relocate to urban areas.9,16,24,25 Instead of mainstreaming, urban living brought continued unemployment and poverty to many American Indians/Alaska Natives. When compared to forced migrants from Indian reservations to urban areas, such as Los Angeles, voluntary migrants tend to be more successful.16 Racism, coupled with a mistrust of the U.S. government, has engendered low self-esteem among many American Indians/Alaska Natives. Racism and discrimination also have contributed to the poverty in which nearly 26 percent of American Indians/Alaska Natives live.26 Specifically, 27 percent of American Indians, 26 percent of Eskimos, and 13 percent of Aleutians reported incomes below the federal poverty level in 1990.27 Poverty rates among female-headed American Indian/Alaska Native households are even greater than poverty rates for individuals; 26 percent of all American Indian/Alaska Native households were female-headed, and 50 percent of these households had incomes below the poverty level.3 Fifty-one percent of all female-headed American Indian households had incomes below the poverty level, as did 39 percent and 31 percent of comparable Eskimo and Aleutian households.27 Half of all American   FACTORS  AFFECTING  THE  HEALTH  OF  WOMEN  OF  COLOR  Indian/Alaska Native children under the age of six are estimated to live in poverty.* This poverty stems from the high unemployment rates among both American Indian/Alaska Native men and women. In 1990, although unemployment for men of all races was 6 percent, among American Indian men the rate was 16 percent. American Indian women were slightly better off than American Indian men, with an unemployment rate of 13 percent; the rate for women of all races was 6 percent.14 Poverty and unemployment have in turn fostered welfare dependency and diets replete with government commodity foods, high both in fat and calories. The malnutrition that was a problem among American Indians/Alaska Natives two generations ago has been replaced by obesity.28 Sixty percent of both male and female urban American Indians/Alaska Natives are reported to be overweight and, therefore, at risk for diabetes and other illnesses. Approximately 20 percent of American Indians have diabetes, a rate twice that of the general U.S. population. Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus has reached epidemic proportions among some tribes.11,16 Although it remains less of a problem for Alaska Natives than for American Indians, the prevalence of diabetes mellitus among Alaska Natives has increased tenfold between 1960 and 1990.24 End-stage renal (kidney) disease is 2.8 times as common among American Indians than among whites, and the diabetes-attributable prevalence of end-stage renal disease is 5.8 times that of whites.28 Neuropathy and amputations also are common among American Indian diabetics. Age-adjusted death rates from diabetes mellitus among American Indians are four times that for whites and twice that for African Americans.14 A sedentary lifestyle and sharp decreases in hunting and gathering are implicated in the high prevalence of obesity and related health problems and mortality among American Indians/Alaska Natives. A study examining the prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors--hypertension, current cigarette smoking, high cholesterol, obesity, and diabetes-- among American Indians and Alaska Natives found that nearly one-fourth (24 percent) of American Indian/Alaska Native women had two or more CVD risk factors. Of all the American Indian/Alaska Native women surveyed, 23 percent were hypertensive, 29 percent were current smokers, and 19 percent were obese (body mass index of 30 kg/m2 or greater).29  Poverty has combined with the historical suppression of indigenous religions and medical practices to place American Indians/Alaska Natives at health risks due to environmental degradation. These health risks result from living in poor quality housing (often with lead-based paint that poisons the children) and exposure to local toxins. Half of all American Indians/Alaska Natives live in areas with uncontrolled toxic waste sites.30 Of the more than 1,000 open dumps located on American Indian or Alaska Native lands identified in 1998, a third contained hazardous waste or waste that required special handling. The Alaska, Oklahoma and Phoenix service areas each had more than 100 open dump sites, while the Navajo service area had more than 200 open dump sites.31 Lacking a safe water supply or sewage disposal system or both, conditions which characterized 28,700 American Indian/Alaska Native homes in fiscal year 1995, also places American Indians/Alaska Natives at risk of illness and disease.32 On some reservations one of every five homes lacks indoor plumbing. From 1993 to 1995, American Indians were the racial/ethnic group most likely to report severe physical problems with their housing.33 Severe physical problems with housing include complete lack of indoor plumbing (or of hot or cold water alone), no electricity or severe electrical problems, or prolonged dysfunction of heating equipment during the winter.34 The loss of access to traditional environments or ecosystems and the suppression of religious and medical practices threaten the body of knowledge developed from plants and herbs. As the environments supporting plant-derived compounds such as digitoxin and ephedrine are vanishing, the knowledge base among American Indians/Alaska Natives about the use of plants and herbs is vanishing even more rapidly.11 The fact that the IHS, in several of its facilities both on the mainland United States and in Alaska, allows medicine men and other traditional healers to hold clinic hours and treat patients in its facilities is a cooperative activity that may help counteract this. Sharing facilities in this manner not only may help foster and preserve American Indian/Alaska Native heritage, but also may expose IHS health professionals to non-western healing practices from which they may be able to learn.11  5  * The poverty level differs for individuals and families by household composition and by size. For example, in 1999, although the poverty income level, or threshold, for four-person families averaged $17,029, this average includes a threshold of $16,895 for a four-person family with two children and two adults along with a threshold of $17,465 for a four-person family with one child and three adults.26 Thus, it is difficult to report the income levels that represent poverty for the populations discussed.   WOMEN  OF  COLOR  HEALTH  DATA  BOOK  6  The loss of access to the lands their ancestors roamed freely has extinguished the traditional gender roles for American Indian/Alaska Native males (as hunters, horsemen, and protectors). American Indian/Alaska Native men often have channeled their rage about this against American Indian/Alaska Native women, who must still fulfill the caretaker role for their families. Family violence among American Indians/Alaska Natives takes many forms--child abuse and neglect, elder abuse, spouse battering, spouse abandonment, and sexual abuse of young children.23 Violence is reported in 16 percent of all marital relationships among American Indians/Alaska Natives, with severe violence reported in 7 percent of these relationships.11 American Indian victims of intimate and family violence are more likely than victims of other races to be injured and need medical attention.35 Both the lack of tribal ordinances to deal with family violence and the refusal of local non-Indian law enforcement officials to take rapes reported by American Indian/Alaska Native women seriously (especially if they are alcoholics or substance abusers) limit the recourse of American Indian/Alaska Native women who seek help. In addition, many American Indian/Alaska Native women are reluctant to report mistreatment by the men in their lives to non-Indian authorities because of the history of harsh treatment of American Indian/Alaska Native men by the U.S. justice system. Alcoholism and its multigenerational effects is at the root of many of the health problems experienced by American Indian/Alaska Native women, as evidenced by the magnitudes of their death rates from alcoholism, cirrhosis, and other liver diseases. American Indian/ Alaska Native women often cope with prior victimization (from incest, rape, and other forms of sexual assault) by escaping into alcohol and drugs; doing so, though, contributes to higher mortality rates.36 Among American Indian and Alaska Native women, death rates associated with alcoholism are much higher than among women of all races. For the 19941996 period, mortality due to alcoholism among American Indian/Alaska Native women ages 25 to 34 years was nearly 21 per 100,000 population, in contrast to the slightly more than 1 per 100,000 rate for women of all races. American Indian/Alaska Native women ages 35 to 44 had a mortality rate due to alcoholism of 67 per 100,000 in 19941996, nearly 14 times the rate of U.S. women of all races.14 American Indian/Alaska Native women who are alcoholics or substance abusers, however, seldom  receive hospitalization, detoxification, or counseling for their addictions. Instead they are often jailed and lose their parental rights.11 In addition, alcoholism and substance abuse among their daughters often adds to the stresses of elderly American Indian/Alaska Native women who wind up parenting their grandchildren and/or great-grandchildren, as well as managing the chronic diseases typical in older women.23 The failure of addiction treatment programs, in particular, to incorporate healing elements from Native cultures, such as the medicine wheel, into their service offerings creates another barrier to seeking care. Many Natives view the use of Euro-American treatment models that focus on a single disease rather than the whole person as another form of oppression. This view thus renders the programs ineffective for American Indians/Alaska Natives.11,37 The prevailing life circumstances for many American Indian/Alaska Native women jeopardize their health in yet another way, because poverty, low self-esteem, alcoholism, and substance abuse may interfere with their ability to seek preventive health care. The necessity of patronizing culturally insensitive providers located at great distances limits preventive health practices, thus placing the day when measures such as breast self-examination have been adequately taught and accepted in American Indian/Alaska Native communities far into the future.23 Preventive health care for cancers may be even longer in becoming a reality because there are no words for cancer in some of the languages of indigenous people. Many feel that talking about the disease will bring it on and hold fatalistic views of it. In other Native traditions, cancer survivors are stigmatized.11 The response to the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/ AIDS) by American Indians/Alaska Natives reflects their long history of mistreatment by the U.S. government and, consequently, the complexities related to providing treatment to them. The terms HIV infection and AIDS have not been given a meaning in all the indigenous languages.38 Thus, these conditions cannot be discussed in local tongues, nor can indigenous healing processes be applied to them. The stigma and homophobia associated with HIV infection and AIDS within some American Indian/Alaska Native communities further compounds the difficulty of addressing this health problem.39 In addition, because the federal government does not pay American Indians/Alaska Natives to be tested for HIV infection--as it has paid them to participate in other federal health programs--many American Indians/Alaska Natives are both skeptical   FACTORS  AFFECTING  THE  HEALTH  OF  WOMEN  OF  COLOR  of the need for testing and unwilling FIGURE 1 to get it.

In 1990, 85 percent of Pacific Islanders-- the way former basketball star Magic Johnson has to be exact, more than 211,000 Native Hawaiians, for many young people and for black Americans.38 nearly 47,000 American Samoans, and nearly 18,000 Recently, a government-sponsored initiative, in partTongans--were Polynesians.41,43 Ninety-three percent nership with the National Native American AIDS of the residents of American Samoa are Polynesian, Prevention Center (NNAAPC), began work to destigincluding both Samoans and Tongans (who are 4 matize HIV/AIDS in American Indian/Alaska Native percent of the population), along with the 2 percent communities.

Guam, the most developed of the islands in the western Pacific, has a relatively advanced system of health care. The Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas, however, provides a lesser tier of health facilities and care to its residents. The Republic of Belau and the Federated States of Micronesia have old hospitals and provide a generally poorer level of care than the other islands already noted.47  Native Hawaiians Native Hawaiians are individuals whose ancestors were natives of the Hawaiian Islands prior to initial contact with Europeans in 1778.11,48 Although the 1778 Native population of the seven inhabited Hawaiian islands is estimated as 300,000, one century after European contact (i.e., in 1878), the Native Hawaiian population had declined by more than 80 percent, to 57,985.49 During the past 200 years, Native Hawaiians have faced traumatic social changes, resulting in the loss of their traditions and threatening their survival as a distinct group. Most of this decline was due to venereal diseases (resulting in sterility), miscarriages, and epidemics such as small pox, measles, whooping cough, and influenza. Poor housing, inferior sanitation, hunger, malnutrition, alcohol, and tobacco use also contributed to the decline.49 The political and economic transformation of Hawaii associated with statehood and with the development of a modern commercial/service economy has resulted in the loss of land and political power for Native Hawaiians.48 In the early 1900s, demands for labor to work in the expanding plantation economy, which  could not be met locally, were satisfied by the immigration of more than 250,000 foreign laborers, most of them Japanese and Filipino. In later waves and smaller numbers, laborers also came to Hawaii from Portugal, Puerto Rico, Spain, and Korea. As a result, the population of Hawaii today is multiracial/ethnic with only an estimated 8,000 full-blooded Native Hawaiian descendants remaining.50 However, more than 80,000 residents of Hawaii chose Native Hawaiian as their sole racial identification in the 2000 Census.46 Native Hawaiians are today defined to include both ""pure"" Hawaiians and part-Hawaiians. They are the fastest growing racial/ethnic group on Hawaii. In 1996, Native and Part Hawaiians combined were a little more than a fifth of the population on Hawaii (21 percent) and accounted for a third (34 percent) of the newborns on the Hawaiian islands.50,51 Native and Part Hawaiians own less than 1 percent of the Hawaiian islands, although they are attempting to regain their sovereignty over more of the state.11 According to a 1999 public opinion survey, land-- including land rights and homelands--is the main issue of concern to Native and Part Hawaiians.52 Of the more than a third of Native Hawaiians who reside outside of the state of Hawaii, 70 percent are in the West (i.e., the Mountain or Pacific states).50 Nearly three-fifths (59 percent or 42,285) of the Native Hawaiian population on the mainland United States live in the states of California, Oregon, and Washington. In addition, 12 states report 1,000 or more Native Hawaiians. Most statistics for Native Hawaiians, however, represent the two-thirds of the population residing in the state of Hawaii. The health problems of Native Hawaiians today in large measure reflect their socioeconomic status. In 1990, more than 12 percent of Native Hawaiians lived in households with incomes less than $15,000, and these Native Hawaiians constituted 22 percent of all the individuals in the state of Hawaii in households with incomes at this level.50 In addition, although 6 percent of all families in Hawaii had incomes below the poverty level in 1989, 14 percent of all Native Hawaiian families had poverty level incomes.50 Median household income of $36,135 for Native Hawaiians, however, was close to the state median of $38,829 in 1989. Households headed by Native Hawaiian females and with no husband present had 1989 median income of $17,493, considerably below the state median.50 Thirty-five percent of these female household heads had incomes below the poverty level. Of the 83,919 recipients of government aid in Hawaii in 1999,   FACTORS  AFFECTING  THE  HEALTH  OF  WOMEN  OF  COLOR  28 percent were Native or Part Hawaiian, 7 percentage points greater than their share of the state population.50 Of the Native Hawaiian recipients of state government assistance, 94 percent received welfare assistance, formerly Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and, currently, Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF).50 Poverty among Native Hawaiian women is associated with their labor market outcomes. Although Native Hawaiian women were 11 percent of the females in the civilian labor force, they were 18 percent of the unemployed females in the civilian labor force in 1998. The 1998 unemployment rates for both Native Hawaiian females and males are around 6 percent.50 In addition to often being unemployed, Native Hawaiians frequently are employed part time or are marginally self-employed in agriculture or fishing.48 Many Native Hawaiians engage in high-risk behaviors, and the group as a whole has poorer health outcomes (such as a lower life expectancy) than other groups in Hawaii. In one study comparing whites, Japanese, Native Hawaiians, Filipinos, and Chinese in Hawaii, Native Hawaiians ranked highest in all the behavioral risk factors (not using seat belt, being overweight, smoking cigarettes, using alcohol, and driving while intoxicated) except physical inactivity.53 Although the 1976 to 1980 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) II reported that 27 percent of all U.S. adults 20 to 59 years of age were overweight, in 1985, a study of residents of Hawaiian Homestead lands (allocated for long-term lease in individual parcels to persons with at least 50 percent Native Hawaiian ancestry) on the largely rural island of Molokai found that 65 percent of these Native Hawaiians ages 20 to 59 were overweight. Being overweight is defined as having a body mass index [weight/height2] 20 percent or greater than the average body mass index for whites. By this measure, Native Hawaiian females were 50 percent more likely to be overweight than all U.S. females.54 Smoking rates among the Molokai Native Hawaiian females--34 percent reported being current smokers--also were slightly higher than the 31 percent of U.S. females who reported that they were current smokers. An additional 15 percent of the Molokai Native Hawaiian females indicated that they were past smokers. Among Native Hawaiians on all the Hawaiian islands, 63 percent were found to be either overweight or obese in 1998.55 Obesity is implicated in the high rates of diabetes among Native Hawaiian women, especially those 35 years and older, who account for 36 percent of all cases reported in the state of Hawaii.50 In addition,  47 per 1,000 Native Hawaiians are known to be diabetic.55 Among Native Hawaiians in the Molokai Homestead study, evidence was found not only of diabetes but also of inadequate control for it, even among persons who knew that they had the condition.54 The levels of sugar measured in the blood and detected in the urine of Native Hawaiians known to have diabetes indicate poor control of this chronic disease. Another indication of poor diabetes control is the diabetes-related death rate of nearly 35 per 100,000 among Native Hawaiians residing in Hawaii.56 As suggested by the evidence with diabetes, Native Hawaiians often enter medical treatment at late stages of diseases. They sometimes seek medical treatment only when self-care and traditional practices have not brought sufficient relief.48 This pattern shows up in the entry into prenatal care by Native Hawaiian women, who are 25 percent of the pregnant women on Hawaii.50 Although more than 79 percent of Native Hawaiian women began prenatal care in the first trimester in 1999, this is less than the nearly 86 percent of all women in Hawaii who got care early in their pregnancies.57 Five percent of Native Hawaiian women waited until the third trimester to seek prenatal care. In addition, more than 43 percent of those who received no prenatal care were Native Hawaiian mothers.50 Late or no prenatal care often is implicated in low birthweights among infants. In 1996, Native Hawaiian newborns with low birthweight (less than 2,500 grams) were 24 percent of all infants born in Hawaii with low birthweight.50 Heart disease and cancer are the major causes of death among Native Hawaiians, as among other populations in the United States. Hypertension, a major risk factor for both coronary heart disease and stroke, is a problem for Native Hawaiians of all ages. The hypertension rate for the Native Hawaiian population in 1998 was 103 per 1,000.55 Even among Native Hawaiians between the ages of 6 and 18 years, the rate per 1,000 of 1.2 is double that for other ethnic groups in the state (0.6 per 1,000). Among Native Hawaiians ages 36 to 65, the rate per 1,000 of 197 exceeds the rate of 130 per 1,000 reported by the other racial/ethnic groups on Hawaii.50 The fact that the incidence of hypertension and heart disease among Native Hawaiians throughout the life span exceeds those among Hawaiians who are not natives suggests that the process underlying these diseases begins early in the lives of Native Hawaiians. To address this health problem, screening and prevention programs for circulatory diseases should be aimed at young Native Hawaiians.58  9   WOMEN  OF  COLOR  HEALTH  DATA  BOOK  10  Breast cancer is the most common cancer among Native Hawaiian females, with the peak incidence of all cancers occurring among 65- to 74-year olds.59 Cases of cancer among Native Hawaiian females younger than 45 years of age, however, comprise nearly a quarter of all cases among women on the islands.49 Because the perception of cancer in Hawaiian culture is bound up with beliefs about guilt and retribution, Native Hawaiian breast cancer patients often are fatalistic and do not vigorously fight their disease.60 AIDS also affects Native Hawaiian females more than other females in Hawaii. As of the first half of 2001, nearly 11 percent of all AIDS cases reported in Hawaii since 1983 were among Native Hawaiians.61 Between 1996 and 2000, 16 cases of AIDS were reported among Native Hawaiian females, nearly a quarter (24 percent) of all AIDS cases reported among females in the state of Hawaii during that period.62 A fifth of all AIDS deaths between 1989 and 1996 and a fourth of all AIDS deaths in 1996 alone for the state of Hawaii occurred in Native Hawaiians.50 Efforts to modify behavior among Native Hawaiians or Other Pacific Islanders and to improve their health are fraught with obstacles. For example, obesity is acceptable within Polynesian cultures where large body size is equated with power and respect.48 In addition, efforts from outsiders to bring about behavior changes are viewed by Native Hawaiians as infringements on their traditions, which value integration, balance, and continuity among person, nature, and the spiritual world. Changes may be resisted for this reason alone.11 For example, Native Hawaiian culture emphasizes the preservation of harmony, which sometimes results in the tendency for individuals to minimize the importance of events such as illnesses that may set them apart or reflect disharmony. This tendency results in delays in seeking services.48 Previous experiences with white and other non-Native people also have made Native Hawaiians suspicious of medical researchers and their advice.54 It may not be realistic to expect Native Hawaiians to give up high-risk behaviors without first solving the socioeconomic problems and cultural conflicts that contribute to these behaviors.48 One way to address the cultural barriers related to delivering health care services to Native Hawaiian women would be to incorporate traditional cultural systems such as Ho'oponopono (a family conference that ensures understanding, harmony, and agreement). Because Native Hawaiian culture is focused on affiliation and close personal bonds to solve or cope with problems, Native Hawaiians are uncomfortable with  impersonal bureaucracies and the reliance on expert authority within these systems.48 Respect for the importance of `Ohana (family, or interdependence and mutual help and connectedness from the same root of origin) also is critical to developing effective health care delivery systems for Native Hawaiians.11 The Papa Ola Lokahi clinics and the Native Hawaiian Health Care Systems (NHHCS) are examples of community-based health care centers culturally sensitive to the needs of Native Hawaiians.  Other Pacific Islanders Samoa, a group of volcanic islands in the southern Pacific Ocean about halfway between Honolulu and Sydney (Australia), is divided into two parts--the United States Territory of American Samoa and Western Samoa, which has been an independent country since 1962.41 On U.S. soil, most Samoans, the second most populous Pacific Islander group after Native Hawaiians, reside primarily in American Samoa, Hawaii, and California.63 More Samoans live on the U.S. mainland (nearly 48,000) than on American Samoa, although mainland residents maintain close ties to families in Samoa by visiting on ritual occasions and sending monthly remittances. Many return to the U.S. Territory of American Samoa to live permanently at some point.44 Regardless of residence, though, Samoans show high rates of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, with associated morbidity due to hypertension, renal failure, cardiovascular disease, blindness, and amputation.44 Samoans are among the most obese populations in the world, with Samoans in Hawaii and California even more obese than those in American Samoa.64 Hypertension also is a problem for adult Samoans, with 13 percent of Samoan women in Hawaii and 18 percent of Samoan women in California reporting this condition.64 Samoans born in the United States have an increased prevalence of hypertension relative to Samoans born in American Samoa. Average life expectancy at birth for Samoans is around 72 years, with Samoans sharing the major causes of death with other American subpopulations.44 In decreasing order of frequency, the major causes of death among adult Samoans are: heart disease, cancer, accidents, cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (and allied conditions), and influenza and pneumonia. Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer diagnosed for American Samoan women living in California and Hawaii.63 Breast cancer accounted for 22 percent of cancer deaths, while cancers of the lung and bronchus were the causes of 19 percent of cancer deaths   FACTORS  AFFECTING  THE  HEALTH  OF  WOMEN  OF  COLOR  among Samoan women. Cervical cancer accounted for 8 percent of all female cancer deaths.44 Access to health care among Samoans living on American Samoa is unique, in part because of the political relationship between the United States and its territory. Although this set of islands, located 240 miles southwest of Hawaii (the nearest site for tertiary care for residents of American Samoa), is medically underserved, American Samoa has operated a locally appropriate form of Medicaid since 1983.44 All inpatient and most outpatient services are provided at the Lyndon Baines Johnson (LBJ) Tropical Medical Center in the village of Faga'alu on the island of Tutuila. For persons living in the urban areas of Tutuila, this aging facility built in 1968 is convenient; however, for persons in rural areas of Tutuila or on other islands within the U.S. Territory of American Samoa, it is difficult to access care. Financial access to services at LBJ is not a problem for the Samoan population because of the Medicaid program. However, other things, such as an insufficient number and scope of needed health professionals, the unavailability of sophisticated diagnostic tools, and the lack of financing to replace the aging and increasingly outdated medical center, hinder the access to quality care in American Samoa.44 Samoans living on the United States mainland are more likely to be poor than other Americans and also are less likely to hold higher paying jobs that provide insurance coverage for families.44 Twenty-five percent of all urban American Samoan families have incomes below the poverty level, compared to 10 percent of all white families. Poverty and low-wage jobs among Samoans are related to their lower levels of education. Samoan women complete high school at lower rates than other U.S. female populations.44 Other barriers in access to health care for American Samoans result from their linguistic isolation, their culture and traditions, and their beliefs about the etiology of disease. Among groups on the U.S. mainland, urban American Samoans are one of the most linguistically isolated, as defined by the percentage of households that contain no persons who speak only English or that contain no persons who speak English ""very well."" Nearly two-thirds of Samoans on the U.S. mainland report that no one in their households age 14 years or older speaks only English, and nearly a third report that no one in their households age 14 or older speaks English ""very well.""44,65 Linguistic isolation makes it difficult for Samoans to seek and receive appropriate health care. Samoan traditions as practiced in the U.S. Territory of American Samoa include a simple, close-knit way of life centered around the family (aiga), the chief (matai),  the church, and the village. Although Samoans living in California, Hawaii, and Washington tend to live in similarly close-knit, well-defined communities and to establish close ties to their churches, only in Hawaii, where the Samoan community is visible and concentrated in three distinct areas (Laie, Kalihi, and Waianae), have community-centered clinics been developed to provide culturally appropriate health care and education.44 Part of the difference in hypertension prevalence between Samoans in American Samoa and on the mainland United States has been attributed to the loss of the protective effect of the strong traditional social structure among older Samoans.66 The high rates of suicide among Samoans have been explained in a similar way. Some see the high Samoan suicide rates as a continuation of a ""culturally sanctioned response to inescapable stressful situations.""67 Others see the suicides as the result of the conflict between traditional Samoan values and newly introduced values. Finally, Samoan beliefs about the etiology of disease often constitute a barrier for them when seeking care. Samoans attribute disease states to such factors as too much work, too little sleep, the weather, certain foods, interpersonal frictions, or moral/religious issues. They thus often delay seeking care for conditions that are treatable or preventable. Other Pacific Islanders, especially if living in urbanized/westernized areas, also report glucose intolerance or diabetes. For example, 11 percent of urban Polynesian women (other than Native Hawaiians and Samoans) report diabetes, while in rural areas between 1 percent and 4 percent report the condition.54 Micronesians from Nauru, an affluent and relatively westernized place, have a 30 percent prevalence rate for diabetes, while Melanesians on Fiji report low rates--1 percent in the rural areas and 4 percent in the urban areas.54 In 1999, 14 percent of the Chamorro residing in Guam were diabetic. In Guam, diabetes is the fourth leading cause of death, with the diabetesrelated mortality rate in 1998 almost 24 per 100,000. Diabetes is prevalent among native Micronesian populations, regardless of urban/rural residence, although prevalence does vary by age group. Almost twice as many Pohnpeis ages 35 to 44 are diabetic (14 percent), as are Kosraes and Chuuks in the same age group (7 percent and 9 percent, respectively) in Micronesia. About a fifth of adults ages 45 to 54 belonging to any of these three groups are diabetic. Among 65- to 74-year olds, Pohnpeis again are twice as likely as Kosreas and Chuuks to be diabetic (21 versus 9 percent each, respectively). The diabetes  11   WOMEN  OF  COLOR  HEALTH  DATA  BOOK  death rate in the Federated States of Micronesia between 1990 and 1997 was almost 32 per 100,000. Diabetes is also one of the leading causes of death in the Marshall Islands and Palau.56 Another female Pacific Islander population--women of the Marshall Islands--has high cancer incidence rates, believed to be the result of nuclear bomb testing during the 1950s and of the subsequent dumping of nuclear waste on the islands by the U.S. government. Resulting radiation exposure is believed to be at least partly responsible for breast cancer incidence and mortality rates among women of the Marshall Islands that are 5 times those of white women, and cervical cancer incidence among Marshallese women that is 75 times that of white women.59  TA BLE 2 Hispanic Population by Subgroup, 2000 Number Mexican Puer to Rican Cuban Dominican Costa Rican Guatemalan Honduran Nicaraguan Panamanian Salvadorian Other Central American Argentinean Bolivian Chilean Colombian Ecuadorian Paraguayan* Peruvian Uruguayan Venezuelan Other South American Spaniard All Other Hispanic or Latino Total 20,640,711 3,406,178 1,241,685 764,945 68,588 372,487 217,569 177,684 91,723 655,165 103,721 100,864 42,068 68,849 470,684 260,559 8,769 233,926 18,804 91,507 57,532 100,135 6,111,665 35,305,818 Percent of Total Hispanic Population 58.5 9.6 3.5 2.2 0.2 1.1 0.6 0.5 0.3 1.9 0.3 0.3 0.1 0.2 1.3 0.7 0.0 0.7 0.1 0.3 0.2 0.3 17.3 100.0  Hispanics or Latinos The earliest forebearers of the group known today as Hispanic Americans or Latinos were Spanish colonists in the late 1500s who came from Mexico to live in what is now the Southwestern United States. The descendants of these forebearers and of other Spanishspeaking populations who arrived after them constitute the largest of the ethnic groups in the United States, now numbering 35.3 million, with an additional 3.8 million Hispanics residing in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.6 Latinos are 12.5 percent of the total U.S. population. The more than 17 million Hispanic women were a little less than half of the total Hispanic population in 2000.68 Today, those who identify themselves as Hispanics come from a variety of different countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, and Europe, with nearly a fifth (19.3 percent) having arrived in the United States between 1990 and 2000.69 The major Hispanic subgroups identified in the 2000 Census are Mexican Americans (more than 58 percent), Puerto Ricans (almost 10 percent), and Cuban Americans (nearly 4 percent). Those who identified themselves as Other Hispanics constitute about 28 percent of the more than 35 million Hispanics in the continental United States.

In the West, the Hispanic concentration is more than twice the national level (more than 24 percent versus almost 13 percent nationally).6 Many of the Hispanics in the West live in California, where this population has grown rapidly, increasing fourfold between 1970 and 1998 and reaching 10 million in 1998. In 1990, California was home to almost half of the total U.S. population of Mexican descent and more than a third of the Central and South American population of the United States. Currently, one of every three Latinos in the United States lives in California, and by 2025, Latinos are projected to be the largest ethnic group in the state.71 The Hispanic population in the United States is diverse by many measures. Latinos can be of any race. Thus, the population ranges from dark-skinned to light-skinned and includes all the shades in between; Latinos include people who are admixtures with Indians, blacks, whites, and Asians.72,73 The Hispanic   FACTORS  AFFECTING  THE  HEALTH  OF  WOMEN  OF  COLOR  population includes farm workers--the laborers in this nation with a life expectancy of 49 years, infant mortality rates 25 percent higher than the U.S. average, and higher rates of cancers and reproductive disorders than the general population.3,74 Additionally, it is estimated that Hispanics comprise about 80 percent of all migrant farm workers--an occupation that is frequently characterized by lack of regular health care and health insurance, and thus an increased incidence of chronic illness and disease.75 Ten million people on both sides of the U.S.Mexico border between California and Brownsville, Texas, are Hispanic, with many living in colonias, unincorporated areas often lacking septic tanks, sewers, and running water.76 Hispanics also include people from Spanish-speaking countries (such as certain parts of El Salvador and various regions of Mexico) whose primary language is not Spanish.77,78 Although median age for the Hispanic population is 26 years (compared to a median age of 35.3 years for the entire U.S. population in 2000), significant differences in age distribution exist among Latino subpopulations. While nearly two-fifths (38 percent) of Mexicans and more than a third of Puerto Ricans (34 percent) are under the age of 18, less than a fifth (19 percent) of Cubans are in this age group. However, more than a fifth of Cubans (21 percent) are older than 65.6,70 In 2000, the median age for Mexicans was 24.2 years, for Puerto Ricans, 27.3 years, and for Cubans, 40.7 years.6 Among Hispanic subpopulations, Mexican Americans appear to enjoy better health than would be predicted, given their socioeconomic status and the fact that they have low utilization rates for health care services for both physical and mental conditions.79-81 Specifically, Mexican American women are less likely than Cuban, white, or black American women to have hypertension, despite their greater likelihood of being poor than either Cuban or white American women.82,83 Puerto Ricans and Cuban Americans, however, use health care facilities at rates comparable to whites. Puerto Rican women are less likely to be hypertensive and more likely to be poor than Mexican American women. In short, there is such variation in the health of the Hispanic American subgroups that looking at aggregated measures can obscure meaningful intragroup differences. The socioeconomic and employment conditions of Hispanics, as of all populations in the United States, influence their access to health insurance and thereby to health care. In 1998, the Hispanic poverty rate was 25.6 percent, falling to 22.8 percent in 1999.26 A quarter  of Hispanic women had incomes below the poverty line that year as well. This quarter reflects the 29 percent of Puerto Rican females with incomes below the poverty level in 1999, along with the nearly 26 percent of Mexican American females with similarly low incomes.84 Twenty percent of all Hispanic families had poverty level incomes, as did 14 percent of all Latino married-couple families.26 Rates of unemployment and labor force participation account for the poverty levels of Hispanics in part. In 2000, the unemployment rate for the Spanish-origin population (both males and females) of 6.8 percent was double the unemployment rate for the nonHispanic white population of 3.4 percent. This 6.8 percent unemployment rate was constituted of the 6 percent rate for males and the nearly 8 percent rate for females. The 68 percent share of the Hispanic population in the labor force reflects both the 80 percent share for Hispanic males (which exceeds the 73 percent labor force participation rate for non-Hispanic males) and the 56 percent share for Hispanic females (which falls short of the 61 percent labor force participation rate for non-Hispanic females).84 As with other measures, for Hispanics, there is variation by subgroup in unemployment and labor force participation rates. Unemployment rates for Mexican Americans (7 percent) are near the Hispanic population average, while rates for Puerto Ricans (8.1 percent) and Other Hispanics (7.8 percent) are greater than this average, and rates for Cubans (5.8 percent) and populations from Central and South America (5.1 percent) are below average.70 Hispanic family households also are more likely than non-Hispanic white family households to be headed by females; these female-headed households also are more likely to have incomes below the federal poverty line than other types of households. Nearly 36 percent of Puerto Rican family households are headed by women, as are 27 percent of other Hispanic, 25 percent of Central and South American, 21 percent of Mexican American, and 18 percent of Cuban family households. Although 26 percent of all non-Hispanic female-headed households had incomes below the poverty level in 1999, the corresponding share of Latino female-headed households was 38 percent. This 38 percent share includes the 47 percent of all female-headed Puerto Rican households with poverty level incomes, along with the 38 percent of female-headed Mexican households and 34 percent of female-headed Cuban households with comparably low incomes.84  13   WOMEN  OF  COLOR  HEALTH  DATA  BOOK  14  Overall, nearly half (45 percent) of poor Hispanic families are female-headed and are likely to face the combined stresses of poverty, lack of health insurance, lack of health care for themselves and their children, and lack of social support.26 This arsenal of stressors places these women at risk for mental health problems as well as for substance and alcohol abuse. The lack of citizenship may be an added stressor for poor Hispanic women and may make them unwilling to use public clinics and other health facilities for fear of detection and deportation.85,86 When Hispanic women are employed, they tend to hold jobs of low status and with low pay. Hispanics, along with African Americans, are more likely than non-Hispanic whites to be among the working poor. Nearly 13 percent of all Hispanics and almost 14 percent of Hispanic women reported working but earning poverty-level wages, as did almost 12 percent of all blacks and nearly 16 percent of black females. Only 4 percent of all non-Hispanic whites and 5 percent of non-Hispanic white women reported working for poverty-level wages in 1999.26 Hispanics are three times as likely as whites and almost twice as likely as African Americans to be fulltime workers but to lack health insurance (37 percent for Hispanics, versus 12 percent for whites, and 20 percent for African Americans).87 Thirty-three percent of the Hispanic population was not covered by health insurance for the entire year of 1999, with persons in the labor force accounting for many of the uninsured.88 This reflects the 40 percent of Mexican Americans, the 31 percent of Other Hispanics, the 19 percent of Puerto Ricans, and the 18 percent of Cubans who are uninsured.89 This lack of insurance is due in part to the fact that Hispanics are more likely than non-Hispanics to be employed in industries and occupations that do not provide health benefits.69 In addition, within the various industries, Latinos are less likely than non-Latinos to be offered coverage by their employers. Also, because married Hispanics are younger than married whites, they are more likely to have young children at home and, therefore, more likely to be part of a family with only one worker through whose employment insurance might be gained.69 Although government-funded health insurance provides coverage for some Latinos, Medicaid coverage of Hispanics with comparably low incomes varies by state of residence, as do eligibility requirements and administrative practices under this health insurance program for all the poor. Overall, however, 14 percent of Hispanics younger than 65 years of age are enrolled in Medicaid. This figure incorporates the 13 percent  of Mexican Americans, the 25 percent of Puerto Ricans, and the 14 percent of Other Hispanics who are covered by Medicaid.89 Hispanic residents of New York and California, however, are more likely to be enrolled in Medicaid than are equally poor Hispanics in either Florida or Texas.76 Beyond the likely lack of employersponsored health insurance, the working poor face double jeopardy with respect to health care because they cannot afford to pay costly medical bills out-ofpocket and because they do not qualify for federal programs such as Medicaid. Some of the Hispanic working poor have the added disadvantage of lacking U.S. citizenship and thus are ineligible for federal health assistance programs, even if their incomes are low enough. Although 54 percent of Hispanic women worked in 1995, half of them worked only part time.90 The major occupation of Hispanic women was clerical and administrative support (24 percent), with the next largest share (18 percent) in professional specialties. This pattern differs, however, by Hispanic subgroup. While the leading occupation for Hispanic women of each subgroup continues to be clerical and administrative support, service occupations are the second leading category for Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Other Hispanic women. Among Cuban women, sales occupations are the second leading professions. Hispanic women from Central and South America are most likely to have service occupations, followed by clerical and administrative support, and sales occupations. Seventeen percent of Hispanic women made at least $35,000 in 1999, about half of the 33 percent of non-Hispanic women who earned the same.84 In addition, large proportions of Hispanic women work in the semiconductor and agriculture industries, both of which have occupational hazards.72 Workers in the semiconductor industry experience occupational illnesses at three times the rate of workers in other manufacturing industries. Agricultural workers are exposed to pesticides, the use of faulty equipment, and to a range of health problems such as dermatitis, musculoskeletal and soft-tissue problems, communicable diseases, and reproductive disorders, as well as health problems related to climate.72,91 Along with socioeconomic status, cultural context or acculturation--the process of change that occurs as a result of continuous contact between cultural groups--plays a major role in the access of Hispanic populations to health care.92 More acculturated Hispanics (as reflected by greater use and skill with the English language, lessened contact with their homeland, and greater involvement with the Anglo American   FACTORS  AFFECTING  THE  HEALTH  OF  WOMEN  OF  COLOR  culture) would be expected to adopt behaviors and have health outcomes similar to the dominant Anglo culture.93 In cancer studies in Los Angeles, for example, Hispanics born in the United States, regardless of their socioeconomic status, appear to lose the low cancer risk associated with being born abroad and replace it with the higher cancer risk of their non-Hispanic Anglo neighbors.73 Less acculturated Hispanic immigrants, however, have a significantly lower likelihood of outpatient visits for health problems (both physical and mental). One example is the incidence of low-birthweight infants (which is highly correlated with the infant mortality rate) among less acculturated, first generation Mexican American women. Less acculturated, first generation Mexican American women have a lower incidence of low-birthweight infants (4 percent of live births) than white non-Hispanic women (6 percent of live births) and than second-generation Mexican American women (6 percent of live births).94 Similarly, immigrants from Mexico to the United States have been found to have lower lifetime prevalence of phobias, alcohol abuse or dependence, drug abuse or dependence, and major depression than native-born Mexican Americans.95 One possible explanation for this is that, even if equally poor, immigrants from Mexico may have less of a sense of deprivation than native-born Mexican Americans, and it is this sense of deprivation that contributes to the prevalence of psychiatric disorders. If immigrants have lower social status than their native-born counterparts, they may be less distressed (than the native-born) by their socioeconomic position because it far surpasses their standard of living in Mexico.95,96 Hispanics, in general, are more obese, less physically active, and less likely to participate in lifestyles that promote cardiovascular health. This physical inactivity even affects less-acculturated Mexican Americans and generally mitigates the generally better health outcomes of first generation Latino immigrants.97 Environmental and economic barriers to accessing fitness facilities, safe recreational areas, and quality health care are part of the explanation for this finding. The lack of materials in Spanish explaining the benefits of an active lifestyle also may limit the physical activity of Latinas. As a consequence, Latinos are more likely to have diabetes than the general U.S. population. The prevalence of diabetes among Mexican Americans is two to five times that among other racial/ethnic groups.98,99 In addition, the San Antonio Heart Study has shown that Mexican American diabetics are about six times  as likely to have end-stage renal disease and three times as likely to have retinopathy as are non-Hispanic white diabetics.99 Hispanics who are more acculturated tend to have less centralized body fatness than their less acculturated peers, however, and are therefore at lower risk for chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. More acculturated Hispanics are likely to have intermarried with groups other than Indian populations, who have a high prevalence of obesity and associated health problems, and, thereby have altered their genetic material enough to reduce their risk factors for these diseases.100 The admixture of Indian genes has been found to be more prevalent in Mexican Americans of low socioeconomic status than in Mexican Americans of higher socioeconomic status. Coupled with the fact that Mexican Americans of low socioeconomic status are more likely to be obese and to have a less favorable distribution of body fat than other Hispanics, these findings partially explain the differentially greater prevalence of diabetes among Mexican Americans.99,101 Another aspect of acculturation for the Hispanic American is encountering discrimination, prejudice, and exclusion (based either on language or skin color), perhaps for the first time, and incorporating into her or his identity a newly acquired ""minority status."" Racial identification among Latinos is likely to be influenced by changes in the racial hierarchies and construction of race in the United States by characteristics of the immigrant population (such as age at entry to the United States), socioeconomic status in country of origin, and ability to ""pass"" or be accepted as white in the United States.102 The process of cultural adaptation and life experiences in the United States also influence the adoption of a racial moniker by Latinos. Experiences with discrimination and exclusion can frustrate expectations of improved socioeconomic status when the dominant culture's values are adopted.103 This may explain the fact that among more acculturated, younger Hispanic women, alcohol consumption has been found to be greater than among less acculturated, younger Hispanic women in the face of traditional Hispanic values that discourage drinking by women.104,105 When measured by language use and a series of sociodemographic variables (such as education, marital status, income, and employment), greater acculturation is found to be associated with the likelihood of being a drinker and with the frequency of consuming alcohol among Puerto Rican, Cuban, and Mexican American women.105 For example, better educated Mexican American women were more likely to  15   WOMEN  OF  COLOR  HEALTH  DATA  BOOK  16  be drinkers and to drink frequently than those with less education. However, Mexican American women living in poverty were less likely to be drinkers than those not living in poverty. This is true even though Mexican American women drinkers living in poverty consumed more drinks per occasion and were more likely to be heavy drinkers than women with higher incomes.106 Highly acculturated Mexican Americans and Puerto Ricans, who are frustrated because they have not enjoyed access to the educational resources of the United States, are the most likely to report marijuana and cocaine use.107 Intravenous drug use, along with other high-risk health behaviors, is most prevalent among high-acculturated Hispanic women.108 In one study, 23 percent of high-acculturated Hispanic women reported intravenous drug use, while 4 percent of lowacculturated Hispanic women reported the same. Also varying with acculturation is the frequency with which Hispanic women have multiple sex partners, a highrisk behavior for sexually transmitted diseases and HIV infection/AIDS that affect disproportionately high percentages of Hispanic women. Only 13 percent of low-acculturated, but 31 percent of high-acculturated, Hispanic women reported having had more than one sexual partner within the past 6 months.108 Further supporting the linkage between acculturation and frustration that may be expressed in high-risk sexual behaviors is the fact that in 1999, 57 percent of Hispanics infected with AIDS were born in the United States.109 Other aspects of culture that can influence health are religion, folk healing, and ""familism,"" or family mores. The health beliefs of many Hispanics relate to their views about God as the omnipotent creator of the universe, with personal behavior subject to God's judgment.93 Beliefs such as these make it difficult to establish the importance of preventive health behaviors and also can make it difficult for Hispanic women to leave abusive relationships. Sometimes religion gives Hispanic women the strength to leave, and, in other cases, it provides the guilt that keeps women in abusive relationships.85 The reluctance of users of indigenous healers and folk medicines to disclose their use, and the associated delays in seeking biomedical care while using these treatments, also can jeopardize the health of Hispanics.110 Family mores that dictate that Hispanics must seek the advice of family members before getting professional health care also can build delays into the care-seeking process that may be costly in terms of either morbidity or mortality.93,111 Thus, low utilization  of health care services, including preventive tests such as the Pap smear and mammography, can result from cultural beliefs as well as from socioeconomic barriers.112 Finally, HIV/AIDS, as it affects the Hispanic community, illustrates the many barriers to effective care that are socioeconomic, cultural, and political. Puerto Ricans, on the mainland United States and on the island of Puerto Rico, have the highest incidence of HIV/AIDS among Hispanics. In 1999, 43 percent of the Hispanics born in the United States who are infected with AIDS were born in Puerto Rico.109 Puerto Ricans also have several characteristics that distinguish them from other Hispanic subgroups and may contribute to their high rates of infection.113 All Puerto Ricans have U.S. citizenship and therefore have no need to marry non-Puerto Ricans to maintain residency in the United States. Thus, Puerto Ricans marry each other in greater proportions than do other Hispanic subpopulations in the United States, and are, therefore, more likely to have sex with other Puerto Ricans than they are with non-Puerto Rican Hispanic or nonHispanic people.113 This has contributed to the heterosexual spread of HIV/AIDS among Puerto Ricans, as has the existence of racially and ethnically homogeneous needle-sharing networks. The frequent and relatively cheap flights between New York and Puerto Rico, and continuous work-related migration between the two, have added to the difficulty in counting and providing continuous care to Puerto Ricans diagnosed with HIV/AIDS. Cultural factors influence the spread of HIV infection and AIDS among Hispanics because they often are unwilling to discuss intimate and emotional matters such as illness and sex unless they are able to speak to someone in Spanish. Low-acculturated Hispanic women, although less likely to engage in the high-risk behaviors through which they may contract HIV infection, may be at greater risk than their behavior would suggest because they may have little knowledge of their bodies and have little clout when it comes to negotiating condom use with their husbands or sexual partners.108 Educational programs to prevent HIV/AIDS, which instruct Hispanic women to encourage their sex partners who are intravenous drug users to use condoms, ignore the riskiness of speaking out for Latinas. Suggesting the use of a condom may cause her partner to believe that the Latina either knows too much about sex or is being unfaithful and may place her at risk of either physical or emotional abuse. Successful educational programs for poor Hispanic (and black) women have been difficult to establish,   FACTORS  AFFECTING  THE  HEALTH  OF  WOMEN  OF  COLOR  partly because these women need help in surviving in their daily environments before they can become receptive to skill-building and informational strategies.108  Black or African Americans The black population of the United States consists primarily of U.S.-born African Americans, although sizable numbers of African and African Caribbean immigrants have become part of this group in the last 15 years.114 The African ancestors of the group known today as African Americans were brought to the shores of what is now the United States as slaves by Europeans beginning in 1619. In the 2000 Census, nearly 34.7 million people (12.3 percent of the total population) identified themselves as black or African American only, and 36.4 million people (12.9 percent of the total population) marked black or African American as one of their several racial affiliations.1 More than half of all black Americans (slightly more than 18 million) are females.68 Many are of mixed ancestry, including individuals with Caribbean, Indian, and European lineage. Among the 1.8 million people who reported black and at least one other race, the most common combination was African American and white (45 percent).115 Ten percent reported black and American Indian/Alaska Native, and six percent reported black and white and American Indian/ Alaska Native. In addition, among African Americans, several cultural-ecological areas have been defined with varying history, economics, and social characteristics that result in considerable heterogeneity of their populations. These areas are: 1) Tidewater-Piedmont (eastern Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina); 2) coastal Southeast (South Carolina and eastern Georgia); 3) black belt (central and western Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, parts of Tennessee, Kentucky, Arkansas, Missouri, Louisiana, and Texas); 4) French tradition (Louisiana, eastern coastal Texas, and southwestern Mississippi); 5) areas of Indian influence (Oklahoma and parts of Arkansas and Kansas); 6) Southwestern areas (west Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California); 7) old Eastern colonial areas (New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, and Massachusetts); 8) Midwestern and far Western areas (Illinois west to Washington state); and 9) post-1920 metropolitan North and West ghetto areas (major inner cities in such places as New York, Detroit, Chicago, and San Francisco).116 Heterogeneity within the U.S. black population also results from the immigrants from the Caribbean basin and Africa. Approximately 5 percent of black  Americans are foreign born, mainly French-speaking Haitians and other non-Spanish speaking Caribbean people, some of whom are farm workers in the United States. These include residents from Dutch-speaking islands such as Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles and English-speaking persons from former British colonies in the Caribbean Sea and from the mainland territories of Belize and Guyana. The 1990 census estimated that there were almost 1 million Americans of English-speaking West Indian ancestry, almost half a million of sub-Saharan African ancestry, and 300,000 of Haitian ancestry.116 Although these numbers are small relative to the entire U.S. black population, in some places immigrant African Americans and their descendants constitute a substantial proportion of the population. For example, it is estimated that at least 25 percent of the black population in New York is foreign-born West Indian. Thus, though seldom studied, marked differences in acculturation exist among black women and contribute to the diversity of their health outcomes.108 Black Americans are a largely urban population (more than 80 percent of all black households in 2000) and can be found in all 50 states.90,114,117 In spite of their urbanity and their wider distribution among the states than other racial/ethnic groups, 54 percent of all black Americans counted in the 2000 Census live in these 13 Southern states--Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia.115 Nearly all of these 13 states had concentrations of African American residents much greater than their national average of more than 12 percent of the total population. Twenty percent of all respondents in the south were black, in contrast to 12 percent in the Northeast, 11 percent in the Midwest, and 6 percent in the West.115 In addition, according to Census 2000 numbers, the largest increase of the black population occurred in the South.118 However, in spite of their disproportionate representation in the populations of Southern states, while six of the ten states with the largest numbers of African Americans were Southern, several were not--California, Illinois, Michigan, and New York.115 Using totals for the population that reported black or African American alone or in combination with another population, 3.2 million African Americans reside in New York state, 2.5 million in California, 1.9 million in Illinois, and 1.5 million in Michigan. Differences in the health of blacks and whites are many and varied. Blacks have more undetected diseases, higher disease and illness rates (from infectious  17   WOMEN  OF  COLOR  HEALTH  DATA  BOOK  18  conditions such as tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases), more chronic conditions (such as hypertension and diabetes), and shorter life expectancies than whites. Thus, African Americans are sicker during their lifetimes and younger when they die than any other racial/ethnic group in the United States.119-123 Morbidity and mortality rates for African Americans from many conditions (cancer, HIV/AIDS, pneumonia, and homicide) exceed those for whites.121,124 These findings exist even though black females are generally less likely than white females to report risk behaviors such as smoking cigarettes, consuming alcohol, or using other substances.120,125-127 Explanations for racial differences in health outcomes have been sought by experts, and many contributing factors have been identified. Although the interactive mechanisms have not been clearly specified, links have been demonstrated between race and blood pressure, mental health, and general physical health status.123 Three factors--genetics, poverty, and racism--generally are believed to have the greatest influence on the health of black Americans.119 These factors are discussed below. The murkiness of race as a concept to define black Americans, who range from fair-skinned and blueeyed with straight hair to dark-skinned with dark eyes and coarse hair, makes purely genetic explanations of the health differences between blacks and whites questionable.128 The small proportion of excess deaths among blacks--that is, deaths that would not have occurred if blacks had the same age- and sex-related death rates as whites--that are due to hereditary conditions suggests that biology explains very little of the differences in health between African Americans and whites. Less than 0.5 percent of black deaths have been attributed to hereditary conditions such as sickle cell anemia.129,130 On the other hand, researchers studying the prevalence of hypertension among blacks have found that it varies with skin color. That is, lighter-pigmented blacks often have a lower prevalence of hypertension than darker-skinned blacks, and pigment is related to the degree of admixture with whites, whose overall prevalence of hypertension is lower than that of African Americans.131 One study found that darker-skinned individuals who identified with higher social class status were the most likely to have elevated blood pressures. Individuals with both light skin and high social status and with both dark skin and low social status reported lower blood pressure.130 Also, research on the presence of cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine, in the bloodstreams of African Americans, white Americans, and Mexican Americans  suggests that (after controlling for the number of cigarettes smoked daily) African Americans retain more cotinine than either of the other groups.132 Instead of looking at population-related genetic differences, others link the racial differences in health to black subpopulations that are exposed to multiple risks--such as intravenous drug users, those living and working in hazardous environments, and the like. Environmental stressors that may increase obesity, for example, have been noted as contributors to the high prevalence of hypertension among black Americans.119 Those health conditions common among blacks that are considered to be genetic in origin are likely to receive more public attention and resources, however, than conditions that arise from behavior or lifestyle choices. For example, conditions such as sickle cell anemia receive more research attention and public support than health conditions attributable to accidents, substance abuse, and environmentally caused illnesses.131 Nearly a fourth (24 percent) of all black Americans lived in poverty in 1999.26 In addition, a third of blacks under 18 years of age (33 percent) and nearly a fourth of blacks 65 years of age and older (23 percent) reported incomes below the poverty level.26 Nearly a third (32 percent) of all black women lived in poverty in 1995. In addition, single-parent, femaleheaded households--44 percent of all black-family households in 1999--were mired in poverty to a greater degree than the entire black population.3 Almost two-fifths (more than 39 percent) of all people in black female-headed families, but only 7 percent of all people in black married-couple families, had incomes below the poverty level in 1999. In addition, 79 percent of the almost 2 million black families in poverty were maintained by women with no husbands present.26 Median income for all black households in 1999 was $29,404, with median household income for married-couple black families at $50,758.3 For black female-headed family households, 1999 median income was $19,133.133 More than half of the black work force (52 percent) is female, with many of these workers earning poverty- level wages. Although more than 9 million black women (out of the total of more than 18 million black women) worked in 1999, nearly one-sixth (16 percent) of them earned incomes below the federal poverty level. Nearly a third (a little more than 30 percent) of all young black female workers ages 18 to 24 earned incomes below the poverty level.26 The largest shares of employed black women have administrative support (including clerical) or transportation and material moving occupations (both   FACTORS  AFFECTING  THE  HEALTH  OF  WOMEN  OF  COLOR  24 percent).134 Many of the black women in the work force--19 percent in 1993--held lower-level, low-wage jobs in the health care sector. Black women held 20 percent of all jobs in nursing homes and 26 percent of all positions as nursing home aides.135 Black women also held about a fifth of all food service jobs (21 percent) and cleaning, building service, and laundry jobs (18 percent) in the health care sector. In 1999, blacks comprised nearly a third (almost 32 percent) of persons working in health service occupations.3 Inadequate income carries over into other aspects of daily life that impinge upon health. These include inadequate housing (which may quicken the spread of communicable diseases), malnutrition, the stress of constantly struggling to make ends meet, dangerous jobs, and little or no preventive medical care.130 Malnutrition in young black girls may later result in low-birthweight babies and high infant mortality rates when these girls become mothers. The high black infant mortality rate also has been related to the intergenerational effects of socioeconomic conditions on the growth and development of a mother from her prebirth to childhood, which may in turn influence the intrauterine growth of her child.136,137 Since many middle-class blacks are the first generation in their families to achieve that status, a black middle-class mother may be giving birth to an infant whose health is markedly determined by maternal childhood poverty.129 An ongoing cohort study of middle-class black women that suggests an improvement in the incidence of low birthweights among infants born to subsequent generations of these women supports this explanation.138 The stresses of constantly struggling to make ends meet also may translate directly into the finding that blacks living below the poverty level, many of whom work, have the highest rate of depression for any racial/ethnic group.116,139,140 Symptoms of depression have been found with greater frequency among black women ages 18 to 24 years than among white women.141 In addition, studies of the effect of employment on women have found that working outside the home can have harmful effects on both mental and physical health if associated with occupational hazards, heavy job demands, or poor social relations at work.142 Snapp (1992) has found that black professional/managerial workers report significantly lower levels of co-worker support than white professional/ managerial workers, a finding that could place this group of women at risk of health problems.140,143 Dangerous jobs may expose blacks to certain cancers to a much greater extent than whites.124,144  Black women are more likely than white women to work in hazardous jobs. Nearly 75 percent of the poultry plants in this nation--similar to the one that caught fire and killed 25 people in Hamlet, N.C., in 1991--are located in the South, in predominantly poor and black neighborhoods. The fire was fatal because locked safety doors prevented people from escaping. Two-thirds of the workforce at this plant (both males and females) was black.72 Hazards in their living environments also detract from the health of black Americans. One of the first major studies to link race with environmental hazards was a 1983 study by the U.S. General Accounting Office that found that three of the four hazardous waste landfills in the Southeast were located in predominantly poor or black areas.74 A 1992 report by the Environmental Equity Workgroup at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) found that blacks suffer higher rates of lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and that blacks have greater exposure to poor air quality in the environments in which they live and work. This report, however, did not make a causal connection between these findings. The share of black Americans living in EPA-designated air quality non-attainment areas exceeds that of whites for the following air pollutants--particulate matter, carbon monoxide, ozone, sulfur dioxide, and lead.145 More than three-fifths of blacks (62 percent) lived in non-attainment areas for ozone, while nearly half (46 percent) lived in non-attainment areas for carbon monoxide. Exposure to environmental lead (via air, water, soil/dust, and food) and the prevalence of high lead levels in the blood (greater than 15 g/dl) also are most common among black Americans (relative to other racial/ethnic groups), but especially so among black children.145 While poor children of all races are more than twice as likely as children of higher socioeconomic status to have blood lead levels greater than 10 g/dl, this difference is especially pronounced among poor black children. Among children living in households below the poverty line, black non-Hispanic children were almost three times as likely as non-Hispanic white children and more than three times as likely as Hispanic children to have high levels of lead in their blood.146 Exposure to hazards in the work and living environments suggests that black Americans might have a greater need than other groups for preventive health care. In reality, many blacks get little or no preventive care for a variety of reasons, including: s parental ignorance of disease symptoms and when to seek medical care;  19   WOMEN  OF  COLOR  HEALTH  DATA  BOOK  s  s  s  s  lack of health insurance to enable access to health care; lack of neighborhood facilities in which to seek health care; persistent use of emergency rooms to treat chronic conditions, which are better managed in other settings; and racial discrimination encountered when seeking care.129,147  20  Older black women are especially likely to report underusing both the Pap smear and mammography, the main screening technologies for cervical cancer and breast cancer, respectively.148 Lifetime risk for cervical cancer among black women is two per 100, more than double that for white women, and ageadjusted death rates for black women are almost 2.5 times that for whites.124,149-151 Estimated lifetime risk of developing breast cancer was ten per 100 white women born in 1980 and seven per 100 black women born that same year.149 However, significantly fewer black than white women survive 5 years after diagnosis with breast cancer (71 versus 86 percent, respectively).89 A possible explanation for this disparity in mortality is African American women are more likely that white women to be diagnosed with breast cancer at a later stage; the reason for this delayed diagnosis is unknown.152 Racial discrimination and racism have remained significant operative factors in the health and health care of blacks over time. From as early as 1867, black spokespersons concluded that racism was a major contributor to the poor health of black Americans in two significant ways. First, ""structural racism"" creates barriers to getting access to adequate care, and second, dealing with both structural barriers and racial insults may contribute to stress-related health problems such as pregnancy-induced hypertension among black women153,154 Stress related to racism also may underlie the overeating and resultant obesity common in black women and may be associated with the more than a twofold prevalence of hypertension and the more than fourfold prevalence of diabetes among black women relative to white women 18 to 30 years of age.155 High blood pressure in blacks is a response to the incongruity between the social position one's work would typically merit and the position one actually occupies.156 ""John Henryism,"" defined as the behavioral predisposition to work hard and strive determinedly against the constraints of one's environment, has been advanced as one explanation for the blackwhite differences in hypertension rates.157 Other research suggests that blood pressure becomes elevated  among blacks in connection with racial discrimination at work, in reaction to movie scenes depicting angry and racist confrontations, and as an internalized response to racial discrimination and unfair treatment.158 A recent analysis of the relationship between self-reported experiences of racial discrimination and blood pressure among working class black men and women indicates that blood pressure is lower among those who reported they challenged unfair treatment than among those who accepted racial discrimination as an unalterable part of the fabric of U.S. society.158 Another response to racism that affects the health of black women is the internalized rage of black men against their mistreatment, which too often is manifest in anger and violent behavior against black women.159,160 This violence has resulted in the highest reported spousal homicide rates among black women-- slightly more than three per 100,000. Deaths among black women due to boyfriend violence are even higher, with a rate of nearly four per 100,000.161 Racism even influences the response of black women to domestic violence. They often are unwilling to call police for fear that the police will brutalize the men who have battered them.85 Racial discrimination has limited the access of blacks to higher incomes, improved health care, adequate housing, and better education--all of which are necessary to achieve modern levels of health and mortality.162 Racial discrimination probably ""...exacerbates the mental health-damaging effects of poverty status among blacks.""144 Being black impinges upon health, even at higher income levels. A study of stress found its severity highest in lower-class blacks and lowest in middle-class whites. Even more notable is the fact that middle-class blacks and lower-class whites were found to have similar levels of stress.144 Another example of what may be a psychophysiological response to racism is pregnancy outcome. Although there is a significant gap in mortality rates between the infants of all white and black mothers, there is an even greater gap between the infant mortality rates of white and black mothers of higher socioeconomic status.130 Mortality rates for infants born to college-educated black parents (from 1983 to 1985) were 90 percent higher than the rates among infants born to college-educated white parents. This excess mortality was due primarily to higher rates of death associated with premature delivery and low birthweights of black babies.137 An additional difference between pregnancy outcomes for black and white women is the fact that black women in their 20s and 30s are more likely than black adolescent   FACTORS  AFFECTING  THE  HEALTH  OF  WOMEN  OF  COLOR  females to give birth to infants with either low birth weight or very low birthweight. This ""weathering"" effect is not noted in white women and may be evidence of the physiological response by black women to cumulative stressors such as racism, discrimination, and socioeconomic disadvantage.163 Although the relationship with the father of a baby has been found to be critical to the early timing of prenatal care, and black women often do not live with the fathers of their unborn children while they are pregnant, differences in the use of prenatal care do not fully account for disparities between black and white women in the incidence of births of infants with low and verylow weights.86,136 Other factors such as the frequency of intervals of less than nine months between pregnancies (which is greater among black than white women) also have been associated with the greater incidence of low-weight infants born to black women. A complete explanation for this disparity is yet to be provided, however.164 Immigrant black couples, when compared to native black couples, have a lower incidence of lowbirthweight babies. The incidence of low-birthweight babies among immigrant blacks is similar to that among white couples. Black babies born in more segregated cities have higher rates of infant mortality than their counterparts born in less segregated cities, another suggestive finding that does not fully explain the differential incidence.154 Significant disparities between black and white mothers also exist in regards to maternal mortality. Black women face a higher risk of maternal mortality, regardless of the level of prenatal care received during their pregnancy.165 In 1998, black mothers were four times as likely to die from pregnancy complications as white mothers; the mortality rate due to pregnancy complications for black mothers was also more than three times the rate for Hispanic mothers.89 The impact on health of responses to racism can be seen by the high mortality rates for blacks from diseases such as cancer and HIV infection and AIDS. Black breast cancer patients have a worse prognosis overall, have a worse prognosis at each stage, and are diagnosed at a more advanced stage than either Hispanic or white breast cancer patients.152 A greater incidence of more aggressive tumors could result in a later stage at diagnosis and the poorer survival rates that make breast cancer a disease with lower incidence but higher mortality among black than white women. Baquet, et al. (1991) found a significant inverse relationship between socioeconomic status and the incidence of both cervical cancer and lung cancer, and  attribute part of the elevated incidence of these cancers to the disproportionately low socioeconomic status of blacks.166 Blacks generally are less educated about the danger signs and more pessimistic about treatment for cancer than are whites. Both of these facts also contribute to making cancer the terminal disease many blacks conceive it to be.167 It has been suggested that the experience of fighting HIV/AIDS is different for most whites than for people of color and the poor. For whites with HIV/AIDS, the fact that many have education and employment contributes to their sense of outrage about the disease and motivates them to fight for what is being lost. Blacks and members of other racial/ethnic subpopulations, who may never have had these advantages, do not have this sense of loss or the associated drive and the educational tools with which to fight against the loss. Delays in seeking medical care, differences in preexisting health, and differences in drugs administered as treatment generate a mean survival time of six months for blacks after diagnosis with HIV/AIDS, while whites have a mean survival time of 18 to 24 months.168 A recent study found that after controlling for differences in diagnosed health and drug therapy, blacks are 20 percent more likely to die from HIV/AIDS than whites.169 Women represent a small but growing share of the cases of AIDS reported in the United States, and African American women account for the majority of these. During 2000, one-fourth (25 percent) of all AIDS cases reported were among women, a somewhat larger share than the nearly 17 percent of all AIDS cases reported between 1985 and December 2000 for which women accounted. Black women reported the greatest number of cases of AIDS among women, both cumulatively since 1985 (74,997 cases) and during 2000 (6,545 cases). (Over these same periods, 28,151 cases and 1,895 cases, respectively, were reported among white women.) Sixty-three percent of all cases of AIDS reported among women during 2000 and 58 percent of all cases of AIDS reported among women between 1985 and December 2000 were among black women.170 Consistent with their high incidence of the disease, African American women are more likely than other women to die from AIDS. In 1999, AIDS was the third leading cause of death for black women ages 25 to 44.171 Although heterosexual contact (37 percent of cases) was the major source of infection of HIV that causes AIDS reported by black women during 2000, 39 percent of black women infected with HIV during this period could not or did not identify the source of  21   WOMEN  OF  COLOR  HEALTH  DATA  BOOK  22  and gender role norms to engage in ""safer"" sexual their infection. On the other hand, intravenous drug intercourse. Behaviors such as these also may be an use was indicated as the cause of AIDS for more than example of the ""slow-motion suicide"" noted among two-fifths (41 percent) of all cases ever reported (i.e., African Americans by some psychiatrists and attributed 1985 to December 2000) among black women. This to the persistence of racism, poverty, discrimination, dual pattern among causes of transmission is the same and lack of quality health care services in their lives.174 for white women, although among both Hispanic and Asian and Pacific Islander women, heterosexual contact Resentment by others at the unfair advantages preis reported as the major cause of AIDS both during sumably accorded blacks under affirmative action pro2000 and since 1985. Among American Indian or grams contributes to the sense of exclusion from and Alaska Native women, intravenous drug use has been inequality in mainstream America felt by blacks, a the major reported cause of AIDS since 1985. For HIV sense that bears on them economically, socially, and infections reported during 2000, however, heterosexual physically. Even if poverty in America is reduced, as contact was their main source of infection.170 long as economic, social, and political inequalities persist, the health of black Americans is likely to In light of these facts, it is surprising that less remain impaired.144 than half (47 percent) of African American women surveyed in 1998 were concerned about becoming Asian Americans infected with HIV. This lack of concern coexisted with the findings that 55 percent of African American Although health issues for Asian Americans and Pacific women thought HIV/AIDS was a ""very serious probIslander Americans often are analyzed jointly, in this lem"" in their community, and half personally knew fact book, whenever possible, the groups are separated. someone who had AIDS, had died of AIDS, or who In accordance with OMB Directive 15, factors related tested positive for HIV infection.

An effort has been made throughout to disaggregate data about Research in both Los Angeles and in south Florida Asians from data about Pacific Islanders and to present suggests that black women continue to engage in findings for the groups separately.

More than half (53 percent) of the black women in the FIGURE 2 Florida survey reported that they had Asian American Population by Subgroup, 2000 unprotected sex with their main partner, and one-fifth (20 percent) indicated they would not use a condom if their sexual Vietnamese Other Asian partner was HIV positive.173 Nearly a third of the black women in the Los Angeles 11.0 Korean 12.5 survey reported having sex with multiple 108 10.5 partners.

They come from places such as China, India, Japan, the Philippines, Korea, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Thailand and represent more than 60 different ethnicities.42,175 In the 2000 Census, of those who indicated that they belonged to only one racial group and that group was Asian, the largest subpopulations (in descending order) were persons of Chinese, Filipino, Asian Indian, Korean, Vietnamese, and Japanese ancestry.40 In 1970, when Asians and Pacific Islanders (both males and females) were totaled together, this population was 1.5 million with Asians the overwhelming majority of this total. In 1990, a total of 7.2 million Asians and Pacific Islanders were counted in the Census, with Asians totaling more than 6.9 million (96 percent). While more than 10 million Americans selected an Asian race as their only designation in the 2000 Census, an additional 1.6 million people indicated that their race was Asian along with another racial background.1 Asians currently are more than 3 percent of the total U.S. population and about 15 percent of all people of color (who designated a single race category in 2000).1 Asian women are 12.6 percent of all women of color and 52 percent of all Asian Americans.4 The majority of Asian Americans--more than 90 percent--reside in metropolitan centers. Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Honolulu, and Washington, D.C., were the five cities with the largest Asian and Pacific Islander populations in 1998. Sixty-five percent of the population of the metropolitan area of Honolulu is Asian or Pacific Islander.3 The states with the largest estimated shares of Asians and Pacific Islanders in 1999 were California, New York, and Hawaii. Over half of all Asians and Pacific Islanders live in these three states, with the remainder living in Texas, Illinois, New Jersey, and Washington. Among all the states, Asians and Pacific Islanders are the largest proportion of the population of Hawaii-- nearly 64 percent.176 However, in 1990, California was home to half of the Filipinos and Southeast Asians in the United States, two-fifths of the Chinese and Japanese, almost a third of the Koreans, and one-fifth of the Asian Indians in the United States.71 When growth of the Asian and Pacific Islander populations by state is examined between 1980 and 1990, however, the five states with the largest increases--Rhode Island (246 percent), New Hampshire (219 percent), Georgia (210 percent), Wisconsin (195 percent), and Minnesota (194 percent)--were neither West Coast states nor states traditionally considered  as homes for large numbers of Asians and Pacific Islanders.177 Additionally, it was estimated that between 1990 and 1999, Nevada (124 percent), Georgia (109 percent), North Carolina (99 percent), Florida (80 percent), and Arizona (nearly 76 percent) were the states that saw the largest increases in their Asian and Pacific Islander populations.176 Regardless, the fact remains that slightly over half (53 percent) of the Asian and Pacific Islander populations reside in the western region of the United States.178 A large share of the growth in the Asian population can be attributed to immigration.179 In 1990, two of every three Asians in California were foreign born.71 Asians comprised 27 percent of the United States' foreign-born population in 1997 and 24 percent in 1999.3,180 These immigrants came mainly from the Philippines, China, Vietnam, India, and Korea. More than three of every four Asian Indians, Koreans, and Southeast Asians in the United States are foreign born.71 Among the foreign born, Asians are second only to Europeans in the number of naturalized U.S. citizens.180 Also, among the foreign born in the United States, Asians report the highest median household incomes.181  23  Major Subpopulations The varied histories of the many Asian subpopulations who have immigrated to the United States contribute to the wide, bipolar distribution in their socioeconomic positions and health. Most Asian immigrants have come to the United States since 1965, when the Supreme Court struck down immigration quotas based on national origin and when only about 1 million Asians were in the United States. Chinese immigration to this country, however, dates back to the mid-1800s. With the decline of the African slave trade and the discovery of gold, waves of mostly male Chinese were brought to the United States as cheap, docile laborers to work in the mines and on the railroads in the Western states. This new servant class became the new ""negro"" for the white majority and was even referred to as ""nagurs"" by some.182 Later labeled the ""yellow peril,"" or disease-ridden and heathen, the Chinese were barred from entering the United States on the basis of race alone by the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.175 In addition, Chinese wives of laborers were barred from entering the United States in 1884.183 These bans remained in effect until 1943, and it was 1952 before immigrant Chinese were able to become U.S. citizens.43,184 In the 19601985 period, the Chinese population of the United States quadrupled, and immigrants from   WOMEN  OF  COLOR  HEALTH  DATA  BOOK  24  more diverse ethnic and social strata came to the United States.43,184 Between 1980 and 1990, the Chinese American population doubled, mostly due to immigration. Sixty-three percent of all Chinese Americans are foreign-born.43 Only slightly less than 10 percent of Chinese mothers who gave birth in 1999 where born in the 50 U.S. states or the District of Columbia.57 In 1990, more than 1.6 million persons of Chinese descent resided in the United States and constituted 23 percent of the Asian American population.185 In 2000, this number had risen to 2.4 million who identified themselves as only Chinese, comprising nearly a quarter (about 24 percent) of the Asian American population.40 Although Chinese Americans live throughout the United States, the largest concentrations are found in California (more than 700,000) and in New York state (more than 284,000).186 Because Chinese Americans are diverse in class, occupation, and regional and linguistic background, in many Chinese American communities unity is an elusive goal.187 Differences between foreign-born and Americanborn, urban residents and suburbanites, old timers and newcomers, northerners and southerners, Catholics and Protestants, Christians and Buddhists, professionals and laborers, and rich and poor frequently override a common ethnic identity.188 The second largest Asian American subpopulation in the United States is Filipino Americans.40 Some Filipinos define themselves by the ""braiding of cultures"" they represent--Asian, Spanish, American, African, and Pacific Island.175 Beginning with U.S. intervention in the Philippine Islands, Filipinos have migrated to both Hawaii and the mainland United States in several waves.43 Between 1903 and 1910, a first wave of Filipinos came to the United States to attend educational institutions. The 1920s was a decade of dramatic increase in the number of Filipino migrants to the United States, with some 45,000 migrating to the Pacific Coast, mainly as agricultural workers. They filled labor shortages on farms and in canneries on the West Coast that had resulted because of the exclusion of Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, and other Asians by the 1921 and 1924 Immigration Acts.175 Yet another wave migrated after World War II to work in agriculture in Hawaii and on the mainland United States. The current wave, consisting of fewer single men, more family groups, and more highly educated people, began after 1965 and continues today.187 More than 64 percent of Filipino Americans are foreign born.43 Evidence of this wave is the 81 percent increase in the Filipino population of the United States between 1980 and 1990. In 1990, Filipino  Americans numbered 1.4 million and were 19 percent of the Asian American population.185 According to Census 2000 results, more than 1.8 million people-- 18 percent of the Asian American population--were of solely Filipino ancestry.40 Asian Indians are now the third largest Asian American group. Their population doubled over the last decade, growing from more than 800,000 in 1990 (11 percent of all Asian Americans then) to more than 1.6 million in 2000 (more than 16 percent of all Asian Americans).40 Asian Indians live primarily in the Eastern United States, although nearly 160,000 live in California.41,185,187 New York state is home to the second largest number (nearly 141,000) of Asian Indians. In 1992, the majority of births to Asian women in the states of Illinois (home to more than 64,000 Asian Indians) and New Jersey (home to more than 79,000 Asian Indians) were to Asian Indian women.65 Most Asian Indians have migrated to the United States since 1965, though some had come to the Western United States in the early 1900s, after initially migrating to British Columbia. They are of differing ethnic groups and backgrounds, but most share a common tradition of non-western medical practice (Ayurvedic), and many are highly educated professionals.41,187 Korean Americans, one of the most homogeneous Asian populations in terms of language, ethnicity, and culture, also are one of the fastest growing Asian subpopulations in the United States.41 Their population increased more than tenfold between 1970 (70,000 people) and 1990 (800,000), and by a quarter between 1990 and 2000 (more than 1 million) to make Korean Americans almost 11 percent of the total U.S. Asian population.40,185,189 Korean Americans first migrated to the United States in response to unstable conditions such as drought, famine, and epidemics in their homeland in the late 1800s and early 1900s, which sent them to Hawaii and the United States mainland primarily as contract laborers.190 By 1920, almost 5,000 Koreans lived in Hawaii, and more than 1,200 had settled on the mainland United States. Most of these were men.183 Others have migrated as a result of United States-Korean interaction during the Korean War (e.g., wives of servicemen; orphans adopted by Americans).43 The Korean population of the United States more than doubled between 1980 and 1990, with most of the growth due to immigration; in 1990, more than 80 percent of all Korean Americans were foreign born. Post-1965 Korean immigrants tend to come to the United States as families, and most tend to be well educated.   FACTORS  AFFECTING  THE  HEALTH  OF  WOMEN  OF  COLOR  Immigration from Japan to both Hawaii and the mainland United States began in large numbers around 1885 and peaked between 1900 and 1910. Between 1900 and 1919, Japanese women--most as picture brides--emigrated to the United States.183 Japanese Americans, however, are the only Asian population with primarily one immigration period (18801924) and with little subsequent immigration.183 The National Origins Act barred Japanese and other Asians from entering the United States after 1924 and contributed to the marked distinctions between the first-generation Japanese Americans (Issei) and second (Nisei) and subsequent generations.43,187 Because first-generation Japanese Americans, many of whom were relocated and interned in prison camps in the United States during World War II, migrated to the United States when Japan had a single language without significant dialects, they have a stronger sense of nationalism than the immigrants constituting later generations.43 This sense of national identity among the Issei has been posited as the explanation for the strong identity among this particular group of immigrants. In 1990, the 847,562 Japanese Americans resided primarily in California and Hawaii. More than 70 percent of all Japanese Americans were born in the United States, making them one of the most acculturated Asian subpopulations with a stable middle class composed largely of white collar workers and professionals.183 In 2000, the Japanese American population numbered 796,700 (nearly 7 percent of all Asian Americans).40 Southeast Asians began to migrate to the United States primarily after 1975, as the conflicts in that region in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam were winding down. The majority of refugees of these conflicts to come to the United States were Vietnamese (66 percent), with Cambodians and Laotians each constituting roughly 20 percent of Southeast Asian immigrants.43 The earlier waves of refugees during the post-1975 period generally were better educated and wealthier than later arrivals, many of whom--especially Hmong (a Chinese-origin population that migrated to Laos and later to Thailand and the United States) and Laotians-- were poor, illiterate, and not at all used to western culture at the time of their resettlement. The trauma of dislocation and resettlement is related to many of the health problems of these Asian subpopulations. About 615,000 Vietnamese, 149,000 Laotians, 147,000 Cambodians, and more than 90,000 Hmong resided in the United States in 1990.43 Although it was estimated that in 2000 Cambodians, Laotians, and Vietnamese combined would number more than 1 million, according to Census 2000, the Vietnamese population alone  numbered more than 1.1 million.40,191 Most Southeast Asians live in Western states, led by the 46 percent of Vietnamese and the 48 percent of Cambodians living in California.192,193  Factors Affecting Health The ""model minority"" image replaced the negative stereotypes applied to Chinese and other Asian Americans in 1966. Coming shortly after the 1965 Watts riots in Los Angeles, this labeling is viewed by some as an attempt to provide proof that the U.S. social system does work for people of color.175,177,182 However, Asians often are pitted against other racial/ethnic groups and are made scapegoats by low-income whites and other racial/ethnic subpopulations who indirectly blame Asians for their failure to succeed and claim that Asians take away their educational and job opportunities. The ""model minority"" epithet has direct implications for the health and economic status of Asian Americans. It tends to trivialize the health problems of Asians, suggesting that they can take care of these problems on their own, and overlooks the diversity among Asians and the problems faced by some of the newest refugees.194 The health problems of Asian Americans are worsened by a complex set of cultural, linguistic, structural, and financial barriers to care. In 1980, a language other than English was spoken at home by nine out of ten Asian Americans who were 5 years of age or older.195 In 1992, 42 percent of the Vietnamese American population 5 years of age and older lived in a linguistically isolated household--that is, a household in which no person age 14 years and older speaks only English, and no person age 14 years and older, who speaks a language other than English, also speaks English ""very well.""65 Nearly three-fifths of Asian Americans are foreign-born, and, in 1999, only 17 percent of all Asian and Pacific Islander mothers who gave birth in the United States had themselves been born in the United States.3,57 If residing illegally in the United States, Asian Americans may not seek out medical care for fear that this will expose their illegal status and result in deportation. Since many Asians are unable to communicate in English, they are not readily employable. When employed, it is often in small businesses or sweatshop-type factories with unsafe and unhealthy working conditions and no fringe benefits such as health insurance.196 Nearly 60 percent of all Asian and Pacific Islander women were in the labor force in 2000, with 20 percent in professional specialty occupations. Nineteen percent of Asian and Pacific Islander females  25   WOMEN  OF  COLOR  HEALTH  DATA  BOOK  26  had executive, administrative, or managerial occupations, while an additional 16 percent had service occupations.197 Only 15 percent of all Asians and Pacific Islanders and only 29 percent of all households headed by Asian and Pacific Islander females reported incomes below the federal poverty level in 1995.26 In 1999, 11 percent of all Asians and Pacific Islanders and only 23 percent of households headed by Asian and Pacific Islander females (with no husband present) were living below poverty.26 These averages, however, mask considerable variation among subpopulations.198 For example, the percentage of the population below the poverty level ranged from a low of 6 percent among Japanese Americans to a high of 66 percent among Laotians in 1990 (compared to about 13 percent for the entire U.S. population).67 The proportion of Vietnamese families reporting incomes below the poverty level in 1990 (24 percent) was more than three times as great as that for Asian Indian families (7 percent).65 Hmong and Cambodian Americans reported poverty levels above 45 percent.43 Both household and individual incomes for Asian Americans support the finding of disparate poverty rates among the subpopulations. In 1980, Asian Americans had average household income of $6,900, less than the U.S. average of $7,400. At that time, only Indonesian, Chinese, and Japanese Americans had average per capita incomes above the U.S. average.43 In 1990, the median family income for Asians and Pacific Islanders was $35,900 (higher than the $35,000 median family income for non-Hispanic white Americans), and 37 percent of all Asian and Pacific Islander American households had annual incomes of at least $50,000. At the same time, more than 5 percent of Asian and Pacific Islander households had incomes of less than $5,000, and nearly 12 percent had incomes of less than $10,000.199 In 1998, the median family income for Asians and Pacific Islanders was $52,826, considerably higher than $49,023, the median family income for whites that same year.3 Three-fifths (61 percent) of Asian and Pacific Islander families had incomes of at least $50,000 in 1999.197 The resettlement of more than 1 million Indochinese refugees in the 1970s and 1980s made the bimodal distribution of economic outcomes even more pronounced because refugees arriving after 1979 have experienced higher rates of unemployment, underemployment, and poverty than other Asian Americans, and other racial/ethnic subpopulations.67 For example, in 1980, unemployment among the Hmong (20 percent), Laotians (15 percent), and Cambodians (11 percent) all exceeded the U.S. average.43  Health insurance coverage varies among Asian American women, as do employment and income levels. Among the Asian and the Pacific Islander populations combined, almost 21 percent were without health insurance in 1999.88 When examining the lack of health insurance coverage by ethnic subgroup, however, the proportions uninsured range from a low of 8 percent among third generation and higher Asian and Pacific Islander Americans, to a high of 34 percent among Koreans, and 27 percent among Southeast Asians. Koreans and Southeast Asians are also the least likely to have health insurance coverage through their employers (48 and 49 percent, respectively). However, Koreans also were the subpopulation most likely to have privately purchased insurance coverage (14 percent). Southeast Asians were the group most likely to have Medicaid coverage (18 percent) during 1997, a marked decline from the more than two-fifths (41 percent) reporting this coverage in 1994. Although all Asian subgroups witnessed a decline in Medicaid coverage between 1994 and 1997, Southeast Asians experienced the most precipitous decline.15 Eighty-one percent of all Asian and Pacific Islander women and 91 percent of Asian and Pacific Islander women ages 65 years and older reported having either private or public health insurance coverage in 1995.198 Fourteen percent of Asian and Pacific Islander women reported Medicaid coverage and nearly 7 percent reported Medicare coverage. Nearly two-thirds (66 percent) of Asian and Pacific Islander women had private health insurance. Despite high rates of coverage in general, selected subpopulations lack health insurance, and this lack of health insurance causes some Asian American women to become frequent users of hospital emergency rooms. One study of Korean American residents in Los Angeles County found that 50 percent of those under 65 years of age and 45 percent of those 65 years of age and older had no health insurance.200 In California, 37 percent of Asian and Pacific Islander non-citizen women are uninsured, compared to 23 percent of Asian and Pacific Islander women who are naturalized citizens, and 18 percent of American-born Asian and Pacific Islander women. Among Asian ethnic groups, a higher percent of Koreans than Hispanics or Latinos were uninsured (40 versus 36 percent, respectively) (Hispanics are the ethnic group most likely to be uninsured in California).201 Although Asian American women overall exhibit healthful lifestyle behaviors, such as a lower smoking prevalence (10 percent) than other American women   FACTORS  AFFECTING  THE  HEALTH  OF  WOMEN  OF  COLOR  (25 percent), there is variation by subpopulation in both healthful behaviors and the prevalence of illness.177 For example, this 10 percent overall smoking prevalence aggregates higher rates among Japanese American women (19 percent of whom reported smoking in one California study) and Filipino American women (11 percent of whom reported smoking in the same study) with the lower rates of Chinese American women (7 percent of whom reported smoking in the California study).202 Even though Asian women smoke less than their female counterparts of other races, Asian men of some subgroups, for example Koreans and Filipinos, have a high smoking prevalence, exposing the females in their home to increased levels of second-hand smoke.59 A 1998 survey of Asian households (the vast majority of whose members were foreign born) found that 31 percent of Vietnamese American women and 27 percent of Korean American women were exposed to second-hand smoke every day in their homes.203 The risk of hypertension also varies by subpopulation. In another study of the California population, hypertension was found to be more of a problem for Filipino Americans (25 percent) than for either Chinese (16 percent) or Japanese (13 percent) Americans.192 Only 9 percent of Vietnamese females in California reported hypertension compared to 16 percent of all females in the state population. The lowest hypertension rate was reported among Korean American females in California, only 3 percent of whom reported the condition.192 Other conditions, such as tuberculosis, are more common among Asian populations than among other racial/ethnic groups. The prevalence of tuberculosis among Asian and Pacific Islander Americans, the highest among all groups, was almost 15 times that for white Americans in 1996. Foreign-born Asians in particular report higher rates of tuberculosis than other foreign-born populations. Although their risk of developing tuberculosis ranges from 30 percent to 45 percent in the year following immigration, this risk falls to less than 5 percent after 10 years of residency in the United States.204 Hepatitis B and certain genetic abnormalities also are more common among Asian subpopulations. The lack of knowledge of risk factors or preventive behaviors for various diseases also is a problem for Asian Americans. One study among Southeast Asian populations in central Ohio revealed that 94 percent of those surveyed did not know what blood pressure is, and 85 percent did not know what could be done to prevent heart disease.192 The lack of knowledge  about cancer risk factors, for example, results in the failure to conduct breast self-examinations or to get screening such as mammography or Pap smears to lessen the incidence of breast or cervical cancer.177 A study conducted in Philadelphia found that 71 percent of Cambodian American and Vietnamese American women did not know what cancer was.205 The failure of Asian women to get regular screenings relates not only to a lack of knowledge of risk factors but also to the belief that cancer is inevitably fatal. One survey of Vietnamese women in San Francisco found that more than half (52 percent) believed ""there is little one can do to prevent cancer.""206 Although virtually all of the women surveyed (97 percent) had heard of cancer, many did not know common signs, symptoms, and risk factors for either breast or cervical cancer. In particular, cervical cancer, which is associated with infection by the human papillomavirus (HPV) disproportionately affects certain Asian women. Vietnamese women have the highest incidence of invasive cervical cancer in the United States (43 per 100,000), and the incidence among Korean American women exceeds 15 per 100,000.207 Cervical cancer is the most frequently occurring type of cancer among Laotian women in California, and it is the second most common cancer among Cambodian women in California.205 These high incidence rates are generally attributed to the lack of prior screening with a Pap smear, which can detect cervical cancer at an early treatable stage. Vietnamese women who have migrated to the United States since 1981 were more likely (76 percent) to have never had the Papanicolaou test for cervical cancer than women who had migrated before 1981 (33 percent).206 In a survey of Vietnamese women in western Massachusetts, a little more than 50 percent of respondents reported having had the Pap test, less than the 57 percent of all U.S. women 18 years and older who reported having had this test in 1991.208,209 Utilization rates of Pap tests among women belonging to other Asian subgroups are even lower. In Los Angeles, 48 percent of Filipino American women reported receiving a Pap test in the 2 years preceding the survey. Similarly, less than half (47 percent) of Cambodian American women in Seattle reported recently receiving a Pap test.205 The failure to get mammograms is of particular concern because of the gradual increase in breast cancer rates among Asian women (especially Chinese, Japanese, and Filipino) through the generations after their migration to the United States, when compared to these same groups of women in Asia. Overall, Asian  27   WOMEN  OF  COLOR  HEALTH  DATA  BOOK  28  American women born in the United States have a breast cancer risk 60 percent higher than Asian American women born in Asia.210 Breast cancer is the most common cancer among Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, and Korean women, and the second most common cancer for Vietnamese women.59,211 Prenatal care is another form of preventive care that many Asian American women do not receive. Nearly half of Cambodian and Laotian American women do not begin prenatal care during their first trimester and have higher risk births because of this.212,213 Samoan and Laotian women are the least likely to receive prenatal care among the Asian and Pacific Islander populations.214 Of the five major Indochinese groups in Oregon (Khmer, Hmong, Mien, other Lao, and Vietnamese), Hmong American women had the least favorable birth risk profile.213 Mean birthweight among Hmong infants born in California between 1985 and 1988 was significantly lower than mean birthweight among white infants.215 The preterm and low-weight infants born to Hmong, Cambodian, and Laotian mothers in 1992 are reflected in the aggregate rates of 12 percent (preterm) and 7 percent (low birthweight) for births to all women in the category ""Remaining Asian or Pacific Islander Total."" These rates are higher than for Vietnamese mothers (10 percent preterm and 6 percent low birthweight), and also higher than for white nonHispanic mothers (8 percent preterm and 5 percent low birthweight).65 Even with health insurance, culturally accepted medical models such as acupuncture and herbal medicines often are not covered services, a fact that further limits access to health care.66 Asian American women are more likely to report using traditional health practices and medicines than Asian men-- 69 percent versus 39 percent. By ethnic group, nearly all Cambodian women (96 percent), nearly a fifth (18 percent) of Laotian women, and nearly two-thirds of Chinese women (64 percent) report using traditional health practices.216 High non-compliance with western prescription medications among these populations clearly becomes a concern. Non-Englishspeaking Chinese hypertensives, for example, exhibit such non-compliance, perhaps in deference to traditional treatments.177 Fear of difficulties in communicating--compounded by shame, guilt, anger, depression, and other responses to certain stigmatized conditions such as mental retardation, mental illnesses, substance abuse, and HIV/AIDS--also may deter Asian Americans from seeking care promptly.67 Asian Americans,  especially Chinese Americans, have been documented to underuse mental health services.217,218 Although there generally is a stigma attached to Asian Americans seeking treatment for mental health problems outside their families, how this is expressed varies with the educational level and length of time in the United States. Chinese Americans often interpret mental illness as punishment for a wrongdoing by themselves, other family members, or their ancestors and are ashamed to seek treatment because of this.218 Some Cambodians perceive mental health problems as the result of evil spirits that must be warded off. Because of their religiosity, Korean Americans are likely to confuse hallucinations with spiritual voices and not seek care. They also are likely to self-medicate for conditions that may not respond to medication. Japanese Americans, however, are most concerned about who knows that they are in treatment and have canceled appointments for fear of running into someone who knows them when leaving a mental health care facility. The traumas due to war (e.g., torture, starvation, rape, forced labor, and witnessing murder), leaving one's homeland, and resettling in another land often result in unique medical conditions, such as the psychosomatic or non-organic blindness reported among Cambodian women 40 years of age and older. Even if Asian American patients seek care, language barriers make conditions such as this difficult to diagnose and treat.193 Cambodians are thought to be the group most traumatized by the turmoil of their home country and immigration to the United States, and as a result have the highest levels of psychological stress of all Southeast Asian groups.191 However, Hmong immigrants to the United States have been found to be particularly susceptible to developing substance abuse problems in the wake of their resettlement. Some use alcohol to alleviate insomnia, pain, and emotional stress. Opium use to cure physiological and psychological problems also has been reported. The use of alcohol and opium among the Hmong to cure medical problems may stem from their distrust of Western medicine. However, it also may be a result of cultural factors; it is apparently common for some Southeast Asian populations to attempt to cure medical problems through drug and alcohol use.191 Although most of the Hmong treated for substance abuse are male, these problems of Hmong males affect the households in which the men live with their wives and other family members. To compound their stresses and trauma, many poor Southeast Asian immigrants resettle in violent,   FACTORS  AFFECTING  THE  HEALTH  OF  WOMEN  OF  COLOR  inner-city environments in the United States.219 Although psychological problems are often found among such resettled immigrants, depression is also found among Korean Americans, most of whom are recent immigrants but who migrated to the United States without war-related trauma. Depression, in fact, is more common among Korean Americans than it is among either Chinese, Japanese, or Filipino Americans.189 In addition, not all English medical/health terminology can be readily translated into the various Southeast Asian languages, nor can many Southeast Asian expressions describing physical and mental conditions be directly translated for U.S. health care providers. Cancer, for example, has a counterpart in Cantonese (the word nham, which loosely translates into English as ""growth"") but is not mentioned as a disease in texts on Chinese medicine. Thus, it may be difficult for Asian patients to accept their diagnoses as real or to accept western treatment regimens for them.186 Differences in cultural patterns, even among highly acculturated Asian Americans, suggest different interpretations of etiology, personal control, and responsibility with respect to health.183 For example, Chinese Americans view health skeptically and as problematic. Thus, even if one looks healthy and has good health habits and medical care, unexpected maladies, sudden death, or psychological problems remain a concern. Japanese Americans, on the other hand, see health as a matter of will, with a strong emphasis on the mind-body connection. They are likely to believe that thinking about getting sick can make one sick. Filipino Americans, however, are more likely to emphasize the relationship between body and soul for health maintenance and illness prevention. For them, health is a moral statement about the correct fulfillment of social (particularly kin) obligations. If Asian Americans get to health care providers and translators are available, communication still is not guaranteed and appropriate care still may not be received.220 For example, differences between the medical systems in the United States and China constitute a further deterrent to Chinese Americans born in China but in need of health care in the United States. In China, physicians generally prescribe and dispense medication, charging only a nominal fee for their services; the major cost for the visit is the medications.186 Because the idea of a visit to a medical professional for a checkup without getting prescriptions for medications does not live up to the expectations of many Chinese Americans, they are reluctant to make visits for routine or preventive care. In addition, 90 percent  of the obstetricians and gynecologists in China are female, a fact that makes it very difficult for foreignborn Chinese American women to be examined by or receive care from the predominantly male practitioners in these medical specialties in the United States.186 Some Korean American women, many of whom have extreme difficulty with English, report using han yak, a Korean medicine, and other over-thecounter Korean home remedies rather than going to physicians in the United States.212 They avoid going to physicians because of ""communication difficulties,"" ""impatient"" doctors and nurses, being ""treated disrespectfully"" because of their ethnicity, and other ""bad experiences.""212 Other cultural characteristics that influence the health of Asian Americans are familism, reverence for authority, and a sense of shame/pride. Asian cultures--like Hispanic cultures--often emphasize family decision making. The practice of family decision making may be heightened by necessity, or it may be rendered impotent within the socioeconomic context of U.S. society.200 The reverence for authority common in Asian societies with hierarchical structures, such as in Korea, for example, may result in a Korean American patient not questioning a physician's diagnosis and treatment and indicating understanding, agreement, and compliance when there is none.67 This reverence for authority also may combine with gender role differentiation to make Asian women reluctant to report domestic violence to either health providers or law enforcement authorities.219,221 The strong desire to ""keep up appearances"" within the community has resulted in low utilization of addiction treatment services for alcoholism and substance abuse by Asian Americans. Although little research has been done on either alcohol or substance abuse among Asian American women, available research suggests that Asians use and abuse alcohol and other substances less frequently than members of other racial/ethnic groups.222 Low drinking rates among all Asian American groups seem to be due to high percentages of abstainers among the foreignborn populations.222 One study of Asian Americans in Los Angeles found that among women, Japanese Americans were the most likely to report being drinkers (73 percent), followed by Chinese (49 percent), and Koreans (25 percent).223 A later study of Asian American men and women similarly found 45 percent of Japanese, 38 percent of Filipino, and 36 percent of both Chinese and Vietnamese reported lifetime use of drugs and alcohol.191 High rates of alcohol consumption also  29   WOMEN  OF  COLOR  HEALTH  DATA  BOOK  30  have been noted among persons with one Asian and one Caucasian parent.127 Filipino women are least likely to report the use of alcoholic beverages. Alcohol use among Asian American women tends to increase with acculturation. In addition, stressors such as divorce and widowhood are associated with both depression and substance abuse for these women.127 Although risk factors for and patterns of substance use and abuse have been identified among selected Asian youth populations, prevalence is generally lower than among youth of other racial/ethnic groups.222 The vast differences between Asian societies and the United States mean that the most basic economic and socioemotional needs of new immigrants may not be met by existing institutions. The painful process of acculturation produces high levels of stress and may produce a high prevalence of mental illness among Asian Americans.139 Some of this mental illness results from frustration at not reaping benefits in the form of high-paying, high-status jobs, commensurate with their expectations based on the level of education attained and the benefits reaped by white Americans with comparable education.224 In addition, when Southeast Asian women, in particular, achieve greater upward mobility (relative to Southeast Asian men) as a result of paid employment in the United States, marital tensions sometimes result that may lead to spousal abuse or divorce.183 Gender stereotyping of Asian women as docile and subservient also constitutes a stressor that may contribute to depression and mental illness.225 One of the major mental health problem for Asian Americans, though, is racism--which adversely affects their psychoeconomic status, as well as the status of other people of color.66  Adolescent Females of Color Although differing ages are used to define adolescence, if one considers the population between 10 and 19 years of age as adolescents, then 40.7 million people belonged to this group in 2000.226 Adolescents were 14.5 percent of the U.S. population, with their number and population share both expected to decline in the future.227 Adolescents often live in single-parent families (31 percent), and many live in poverty (nearly 17 percent).228,229 Forty percent of the adolescents in female-headed families live in poverty. This includes 54 percent of Hispanic, 50 percent of black non-Hispanic, and 27 percent of white non-Hispanic adolescents.229 According to the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), 65 percent of  adolescents in the lowest-income group ($10,000 or less) live in single-parent homes. In addition, pronounced income differentials exist by race/ethnicity-- teenagers of color comprised more than half of all adolescents whose families had incomes less than $20,000.228 Living in poverty plays a critical role in access to health care services and in shaping health outcomes for adolescents, as it also does for adults. At the same time that the total adolescent population is projected to decline in the near future, the representation of adolescents of color among this population is expected to increase. Adolescents were 18 percent of the 1990 populations of American Indians/Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, Hispanics, and blacks; they were 16 percent of the 1990 Asian American population.230,231 The adolescent population already is more racially diverse than the U.S. population of all ages. In 2000, black non-Hispanics were 12.3 percent and Hispanics 12.5 percent of the population of all ages; however, black non-Hispanics were 14 percent and Hispanics were 15 percent of people ages 10 to 19 at that time.4 In 2000, 35 percent of all adolescents belonged to a racial/ethnic group, with this share predicted to reach 40 percent by the year 2020.4,231 Female American Indian/Alaska Native adolescents were 18 percent of all female American Indians/Alaska Natives and 49 percent of all American Indians/Alaska Natives ages 10 to 19 in 2000.4 Half of all American Indian/Alaska Native adolescents live in poor or nearpoor families.231 Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander adolescent females were similarly about 18 percent of the females of these populations. In 2000, an estimated 36 percent of the Hispanic population was younger than 19 years of age, with female Hispanic adolescents 48 percent of all adolescents.70,230,231 Currently 35 percent of the black population is 19 years of age or younger, with adolescents constituting 16 percent of all black females.4 Forty-three percent of black adolescents live in poverty, with an even greater share (two-thirds) living in single-parent homes.231 In recent years, Asian Americans have constituted nearly half of all immigrants to the United States, with foreign-born adolescents more than half of this immigrant stream. Twenty-seven percent of Asian Americans are 19 years of age or younger.4 In the early 1990s, 15 percent of all Asian American females were adolescents; by 2000, their share had fallen slightly to 13 percent. Females comprised 49 percent of all Asian American adolescents in both the early 1990s and in 2000.   FACTORS  AFFECTING  THE  HEALTH  OF  WOMEN  OF  COLOR  Access to Services Adolescents have among the lowest rates of physician contact among all age groups in the United States, and many adolescents of color have even lower rates of contact.231,232 Although white youths ages 12 to 17 in 1988 reported 3.6 contacts with a physician during the past year, black, Hispanic, and Asian and Pacific Islander youth reported fewer (2.4, 2.4, and 1.0, respectively).232 American Indian/Alaska Native adolescents reported 7.0 physician contacts during the past year. Seventeen percent of females ages 10 to 19 did not make a health care visit at all during 1996.229 Data on the share of youth ages 12 to 17 who reported in 1988 that they had not received routine care in the past 2 years are consistent with the frequencies of physician contact. More than a fifth of white (22 percent) and black (21 percent) youth reported receiving no routine care in the past 2 years, while at least a quarter of Hispanic (25 percent) and American Indian/Alaska Native youth (27 percent) reported the same. Nearly a third of Asian and Pacific Islander youth (31 percent) indicated they had not received routine care in the past 2 years.232 In a 1989 survey of American Indian/Alaska Native adolescents, 54 percent of the males and females combined reported having a physical and a hearing examination within the last 2 years.233 The lack of a regular source for routine medical care and the lack of a particular provider for sick care also are problems for adolescents of color. While 13 percent of white, black, and American Indian/Alaska Native youth each reported having no regular source for routine medical care in 1988, 21 percent of Asian and Pacific Islander youth and 24 percent of Hispanic youth reported this.232 The shares of adolescents of color with no particular provider for sick care were even greater than the shares lacking a regular source for routine medical care. Eighteen percent of white youth ages 12 to 17, and 38 percent of Hispanic youth reported no particular provider for sick care. Around a third of the other adolescents of color (blacks, Asians and Pacific Islanders, and American Indians/Alaska Natives) reported this same lack of a provider.232 Health insurance and the coverage of adolescents under family policies are key to the use of services and access to care for teens and partially explain the findings noted above. Approximately 74 percent of all adolescents are covered by private health insurance. Some sources indicate that more than half of black and Hispanic adolescents and two-thirds of other adolescents of color have private health insurance.231 For many youth of color, however, public health insurance,  generally Medicaid, provides the pathway to health care services and may provide only limited access to the full range of needed services. Twenty-eight percent of black adolescents, 14 percent of Hispanic adolescents, and 13 percent of other youth of color are estimated to have Medicaid or other public health insurance.231 More than 14 percent of all adolescents ages 12 to 17 years are uninsured, however, with this incorporating the 12 percent of Asian and Pacific Islander adolescents to 41 percent of American Indian/Alaska Native youth.88,232 Thirteen percent of white adolescents report no health insurance, as well as 18 percent of black and 28 percent of Hispanic youth.229 White nonHispanic adolescents with health insurance coverage are twice as likely as their counterparts with no insurance to have made a health care visit in the preceding 12 months. However, insured Hispanic adolescents were more than twice as likely and insured black non-Hispanic adolescents were three times as likely as their uninsured counterparts to have made a health care visit in the past year.229 Although the lack of health insurance and family poverty often constitute insurmountable barriers to adolescents in need of health care services, nonfinancial barriers also interfere with the ability of adolescents to get care and contribute to limited frequency of contact and the lack of relationships with providers. Services often are fragmented and do not address the specific needs of adolescents.234 Depending on the location of facilities, getting there sometimes is problematic. Issues of client-provider confidentiality vis-vis parents also serve as barriers to adolescents who might otherwise seek care. Real or imagined fears about one's reputation or about disapproval by the provider, family, or peers may keep adolescents away from needed health services as well.231,235  31  Health The parents of black, American Indian/Alaska Native, and Hispanic youth ages 12 to 17 in 1988 were less likely than the parents of white and Asian and Pacific Islander youth the same ages to rate the health of their adolescents as excellent.232 Fifty-four percent of white adolescents and 63 percent of Asian and Pacific Islander adolescents were rated in excellent health with no limiting conditions. Only 25 percent of American Indian/Alaska Native youth but 39 percent of black and 43 percent of Hispanic youth were rated similarly. A minuscule proportion (0.8 percent) of the parents of Asian and Pacific Islander youth ages 12 to 17 rated their offspring in fair to poor health or with limiting conditions.232 The shares of white (9 percent),   WOMEN  OF  COLOR  HEALTH  DATA  BOOK  32  American Indian/Alaska Native (8 percent), and Hispanic (10 percent) youth rated fair to poor were considerably higher, as was the nearly 12 percent of black adolescents whose parents rated their health as fair or poor. A 1989 survey of American Indian/Alaska Native teens found them three times as likely as white teens to rate their health poor.233 Most of the data on the health of adolescents is on their high-risk behaviors, such as unprotected sexual intercourse, alcohol use, and substance abuse, which are discussed in the following section. The limited information on the mental health of adolescent females of color suggests, however, that their life circumstances and the low self-esteem that often emanates from these circumstances contribute to their reporting of depression and suicide attempts. Young Asian American women have the highest depression rates for any group in the United States, and the second highest suicide rate for females ages 15 to 24. One study of California college students found many young Asian American women suffered from low selfesteem and a limited sense of control over their lives. These women, many of whom came from Asian immigrant families, cited conflicting Asian and American cultural values, familial expectations, and an emphasis on internalizing mental problems to ""save face"" as contributing factors. Additionally, many Asian women noted a lack of culturally sensitive mental health and support services on college campuses.236 Although a slightly larger share of Hispanic (26 percent) than of white (23 percent) female high school students reported having thought seriously about attempting suicide during the 12 months preceding the survey, a smaller share of black females (19 percent) reported similar thoughts. Consistent with reported suicide ideation, 19 percent of adolescent Hispanic females attempted suicide at least once during the 12 months preceding the 1999 survey, while 9 percent and almost 8 percent of white and black adolescent females, respectively, reported attempts.237 Twenty-two percent of American Indian/ Alaska Native adolescent females reported in a 1989 survey that they had ever attempted suicide.233 In 1997, American Indians/Alaska Natives ages 15 to 19 (of both sexes) had the highest suicide mortality among all racial and ethnic groups, at 20.5 deaths per 100,000 population.227 Other studies have shown that black adolescent females tend to report depressive symptoms at higher rates than white adolescent females and that lower socioeconomic status accentuates this finding.231 Rates for completed suicide among black adolescent females  remain lower than rates for white adolescent females, although rates among these young black women have increased in recent years. Female Mexican American adolescents have been noted to indicate a greater number of depressive symptoms than either their black or white counterparts.231 In addition, in one study, Hispanic adolescent females were found to account for 25 percent of all adolescent patients admitted to the hospital for suicidal behavior, a far greater share than expected based on their population share.231 Although information is spotty for Asian American and for Pacific Islander adolescents, their age-adjusted rate of commitments to psychiatric hospitals is about half that for white youth.231 This at first seems surprising in light of the high depression scores reported for adolescent Asian refugees. However, when taken in the context of many Asian cultures, in which seeking mental health care violates norms about family interactions and may be viewed as a source of shame to a family, this finding seems believable. Perhaps partly as a result of this underutilization of mental health services, suicide accounts for a much larger proportion of deaths among Asian American youths than among white adolescents. The overall prevalence of mental health problems among American Indian/Alaska Native youth appears to be similar to that of white adolescents, although there has been a recent increase in problems in early adolescence among American Indian/Alaska Native youth.231 Eating and weight-related disorders are increasing among American Indian/Alaska Native youth, and, according to the Indian Adolescent Health Survey, 20 percent of females had attempted suicide, an attempt rate more than double that for white youth. Major risk factors identified for suicide attempts among American Indian/Alaska Native adolescents include: female gender; poor self-perception of health; knowledge of a suicide attempt by a friend or family member; a history of mental and behavioral problems requiring professional help; and extreme alienation from family and community.11,238 The completed suicide rate for American Indian/Alaska Native youth is more than twice the rate for white adolescents, and, in contrast to the national pattern, suicide is more likely to occur among younger adolescents than older ones.227  Health Risk Behaviors Most of the behaviors discussed below can place adolescents at risk of unhealthful outcomes. Unprotected sexual intercourse, substance use or abuse, and operating a motor vehicle in an unsafe manner all can result either in morbidity or death. Sound nutrition practices   FACTORS  AFFECTING  THE  HEALTH  OF  WOMEN  OF  COLOR  and regular physical activity, two health enhancing behaviors, also are discussed for adolescent females of color. Because most of the information both about health-risk and healthful behaviors is gathered in surveys administered to students in junior high and high schools, these figures may perhaps best be thought of as underestimates of high-risk and overestimates of healthful behaviors among youth, if one accepts the notion that high-risk behaviors are more prevalent among out-of-school youth than among youth who remain in school.239 Since dropout rates are higher among youth of color than among white adolescents, the figures discussed below may well underestimate the health-risk behaviors among the racial/ethnic subpopulations of youth. SEXUAL INTERCOURSE Sexual intercourse can place adolescent females of color at risk for sexually transmitted diseases, HIV infection/AIDS, and pregnancy during years when their bodies are still developing and are, therefore, exceptionally vulnerable to such assaults. Adolescent females of color too often have low self-esteem and use their fertility to seek approval from the males with whom they have intercourse. In the 1999 Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), among female high school students (grades 9 through 12), 45 percent of white, 46 percent of Hispanic, and 67 percent of black adolescent females reported having ever had sexual intercourse.237 By contrast, in a 1992 study of Asian and Pacific Islander high school students, 70 percent of the females reported they were virgins.240 In a 1989 survey of American Indian/Alaska Native teens, 57 percent of the females queried reported having had sexual intercourse by the time they were in the 12th grade, with the average age of first intercourse reported to be 14 years.233 More than 11 percent of all black adolescent females in YRBS reported that they first had sexual intercourse before age 13; an even larger share (21 percent) indicated that they had engaged in sex with four or more partners. Smaller shares of Hispanic and white adolescent females reported both having sexual intercourse before age 13 (more than 4 percent of Hispanics and almost 4 percent of whites) and having had four sexual partners (11 percent of Hispanics and 13 percent of whites).237 Significantly smaller shares of Asian and Pacific Islander students reported comparable sexual activity. Thirty percent of Asian and Pacific Islander female high school students reported having had vaginal intercourse, and less than 5 percent had sexual intercourse before age 13. Slightly more than 2 percent had more than 5 sexual partners.240  Black adolescent females were most likely to report currently being sexually active (50 percent), with slightly more than a third of white (35 percent) and Hispanic (34 percent) adolescent females also reporting current sexual activity. Among currently sexually active adolescent females, a larger percentage of blacks (65 percent) than either of whites (48 percent) or Hispanics (43 percent) reported condom use during last sexual intercourse, however.237 More than a third (36 percent) of Asian and Pacific Islander adolescents reported using condoms at all times.240 Birth control pill use before last sexual intercourse was more common among white adolescent females (26 percent) than among either blacks (12 percent) or Hispanics (11 percent).237 As a result of unprotected or inadequately protected sexual intercourse, adolescent females of color often become pregnant; many also become mothers. High rates of teen pregnancy are found among young Hispanic and black women. In 1999, the birth rate for Hispanic females ages 15 to 17 years was 61 per 1,000 women, more than three times the rate of 17 per 1,000 women for non-Hispanic white females the same age. Among 18- to 19-year-old Hispanic females, the birth rate of 139 per 1,000 women was more than double the rate of 59 per 1,000 non-Hispanic white females. Teen pregnancy rates among black adolescent females are comparable to rates among Hispanic adolescent females, with the rates for blacks at 54 per 1,000 females ages 15 to 17 and 127 per 1,000 females ages 18 to 19.57 Birth rates to Asian and Pacific Islander teens are the smallest reported in 1999. Only 12 per 1,000 Asian and Pacific Islander females ages 15 to 17 years and 38 per 1,000 Asian and Pacific Islander females ages 18 to 19 years reported live births in 1999.241 Although Asian and Pacific Islander teens as a group are less likely than other female teens to become pregnant and give birth, selected Southeast Asian populations report high teen pregnancy rates. In California, between 1989 and 1998, Laotian girls had the highest teen pregnancy rate (189 per 1,000 teens) in the state, well above the state average rate of 118 per 1,000 teen females. The second highest rate in the state (183.9 per 1,000) was among Other Asians--including Malaysians and Indonesians. Chinese, Indian, and Korean teen females in California had rates around 10 per 1,000. Different cultural norms (favoring marriage and pregnancy during the teen years) and the lack of materials targeted to preventing pregnancy among teens of these racial/ethnic groups are among the factors associated with these rates.242  33   WOMEN  OF  COLOR  HEALTH  DATA  BOOK  34  Birth rates also are high for other selected teen populations. Adolescent childbearing is twice as common among American Indian/Alaska Native females as it is among females of all races combined, with 42 percent of all American Indian/Alaska Native mothers being under age 20 when they had their first child.243 Birth rates for American Indian/Alaska Native adolescent females were 46 per 100,000 for 15 to 17 year olds, and 122 per 100,000 for 18 to 19 year olds in 1996.229 In addition, 21 percent of live births among the IHS service population between 1994 and 1996 were to American Indian/Alaska Native mothers under the age of 20.14 Native Hawaiian women also are likely to give birth when younger than 20 years of age; in 1999, 18 percent of births to Native Hawaiian mothers were to this subpopulation.57 Among Samoan and Guamanian women, sizable proportions of births in 1992 also were to females younger than age 20; 11 percent of births to Samoan mothers and 16 percent of births to Guamanian mothers were to women less than 20 years of age.65 The racial/ethnic group with the smallest share of births to females younger than 20 years of age is Asian Americans. Births to females younger than 20 years of age range from less than 1 percent among Chinese adolescents to 6 percent among Filipino adolescents.57 Sexual intercourse can result in HIV infection/AIDS, as well as in pregnancy or birth. Between 1985 and December 2000, although the total number of women of each racial/ethnic group who were diagnosed with HIV infection and AIDS varied greatly, comparable percentages of female teens of color (ages 13 to 19 years) were diagnosed with these conditions. Between 5 percent (Asians and Pacific Islanders) and 9 percent (black non-Hispanics and American Indians/Alaska Natives) of teen females of color were diagnosed with HIV infection through December 2000. However, these percentages correspond to 7 cases among Asian and Pacific Islander female teens, 21 cases among American Indian/Alaska Native teens, and 2,320 cases among black non-Hispanic teens. Six percent of 172 cases of HIV infection were diagnosed among Hispanic females ages 13 to 19 years.170 Because it takes time for AIDS to develop from HIV infection, only one percent of each group of females of color was diagnosed with AIDS while between the ages of 13 years and 19 years. However, this one percent also represents very different numbers of females--four American Indians/Alaska Natives, eight Asians and Pacific Islanders, 286 Hispanics, and 1,122 black non-Hispanics.  SUBSTANCE ABUSE The use by adolescent females of substances such as cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine or crack cocaine can negatively influence present and future health. Large majorities of both white and Hispanic (71 percent each), and black (69 percent) adolescent females reported in 1999 that they had tried cigarette smoking, even if only one or two puffs were taken.237 Smaller shares reported current cigarette use (defined as smoking on at least one occasion during the past 30 days) both in 19851989 and in 1995, although the proportions varied considerably by racial/ethnic group. American Indian/Alaska Native high school seniors in 19851989 were the most likely to report current smoking (44 percent), followed by white females (34 percent), and Puerto Rican and other Latin American females (25 percent).244 In a different 1989 survey of American Indian/Alaska Native teens, 18 percent of the adolescent females in high school reported daily cigarette smoking. Less than 20 percent of the following groups of female high school seniors also reported current cigarette smoking in 19851989: Mexican Americans (19 percent), Asian Americans (14 percent), and black Americans (13 percent). Data on current smoking from the 1995 YRBS, available only for white, black, and Hispanic females, revealed greater smoking among white (40 percent) and Hispanic adolescent females (33 percent) than among black adolescent females (12 percent). In 1999, white (39 percent) and Hispanic (nearly 32 percent) female teens remained equally likely to report smoking as in 1995, while black female adolescents (nearly 18 percent) were somewhat more likely to smoke than in 1995.237 Although smokeless tobacco is used more commonly by males than females, smokeless tobacco use among American Indian/Alaska Native and Hispanic females is of concern. Implicated in cancers of the mouth and throat, smokeless tobacco and smoking cigarettes produce comparable levels of nicotine in the body. A variety of regional studies conducted in the 1980s among American Indian/Alaska Native school-age youth found that less than 3 percent of adolescent females use smokeless tobacco, although between 3 percent and 26 percent of adolescent males reported such use.245 One 1989 survey of American Indian/Alaska Native teens reported daily use of smokeless tobacco by 8 percent of high school females. The 1999 YRBS reported that nearly 2 percent of both white and Hispanic adolescent females used smokeless tobacco, in contrast to only 0.2 percent of black adolescent females.237   FACTORS  AFFECTING  THE  HEALTH  OF  WOMEN  OF  COLOR  As with cigarettes, most female adolescents have tried alcohol. In 1999, large majorities of Hispanic (85 percent), white (82 percent), and black (76 percent) adolescent females reported having had at least one drink of alcohol.237 Also as with cigarette smoking, smaller shares of adolescent females reported current use (defined as having a drink on at least one of the preceding 30 days), with white adolescent females reporting greater current use in both 19851989 and 1999 than the other adolescents. In 19851989, 67 percent of white females who were high school seniors reported current alcohol use, followed by 60 percent of American Indian/Alaska Native females, 51 percent of Mexican American females, and 43 percent of Puerto Rican and other Latin American females.244 Asian American (34 percent) and black American (33 percent) adolescent female high school seniors were least likely to report current alcohol use. In 1989, more than 13 percent of American Indian/Alaska Native adolescent females reported weekly or more frequent alcohol use.233 A decade later, the 1999 YRBS found that alcohol use among white adolescent females (grades 9 to 12) had declined to 50 percent, with rates for Hispanic females at 49 percent and for black females at 41 percent (increases over the 19851989 figures).237 Marijuana had been tried by more than two-fifths of both white (42 percent) and black (43 percent) adolescent females and by nearly half (46 percent) of Hispanic adolescent females surveyed in the 1999 YRBS.237 Current marijuana use, however, was acknowledged by much smaller shares of adolescent females of color in both 19851989 and 1999. In 19851989, 24 percent of American Indian/Alaska Native female high school seniors reported current marijuana use (i.e., used at least one time during the preceding 30 days), as did 20 percent of white female and 14 percent of Mexican American female high school seniors.244 However, just 10 percent of both black and Puerto Rican and other Latin American female high school seniors reported current marijuana use in 19851989, along with 8 percent of Asian American female high school seniors. Ten years later (in 1999), current marijuana use was more common among black, white, and Hispanic female high school students (grades 9 to 12). More than a fifth of white (23 percent), black (22 percent), and Hispanic (22 percent) adolescent females reported current marijuana use.237 Although small shares of all female high school seniors in 19851989 reported current cocaine use (used at least once during the preceding 30 days), by 1999, the largest reported use of both cocaine and crack (or freebase cocaine use) was among Hispanic  females. In 19851989, 9 percent of American Indian or Alaska Native and 4 percent of white female high school seniors acknowledged cocaine use during the preceding 30 days. About 3 percent of Mexican American, Puerto Rican and other Latin American, and Asian American females, along with 1 percent of black females, also reported use.244 However, in the 1999 YRBS, Hispanic adolescent females were most likely to report ever having tried any form of cocaine (powder, crack, or freebase)--12 percent. Hispanic females in grades 9 through 12 are the group most likely (more than 5 percent) to acknowledge current use of cocaine as well. Nine percent of comparable white females and only 1.5 percent of comparable black females reported ever having tried cocaine or crack, or freebase use of cocaine, with smaller shares (3 percent of whites and 1 percent of blacks) admitting current cocaine use.237 UNSAFE MOTOR VEHICLE OPERATION Because motor vehicle accidents are a major cause of death for adolescents, high-risk behaviors when operating or riding in motor vehicles are noteworthy. In the 1999 YRBS, 17 percent of black adolescent females reported rarely or never using a seat belt when riding in a car or truck driven by someone else. Eleven percent and nearly 10 percent, respectively, of white and Hispanic adolescent females reported this same failure to use seat belts.237 In addition, 37 percent of Hispanic adolescent females reported that one or more times during the preceding 30 days they rode with a driver who had been drinking, and 8 percent reported that they themselves had driven after drinking alcohol. The shares of black (35 percent) and white (32 percent) adolescent females who reported riding one or more times during the preceding 30 days with a driver who had been drinking alcohol are comparable. A larger share of white females (10 percent) than black females (5 percent), however, indicated having driven after drinking alcohol.237  35  Healthful Behaviors Dietary practices and physical activity can be health affirming for adolescents, as for adults. Sizable proportions of adolescent females limit their fat intake, while lesser proportions eat multiple servings of fruits and vegetables and drink milk daily. Large majorities of three groups of adolescent females (76 percent of whites, 69 percent of Hispanics, and 56 percent of blacks) indicated that on the day preceding the YRBS, they had eaten no more than two servings of foods high in fat.246 In addition, nearly a third (30 percent)   WOMEN  OF  COLOR  HEALTH  DATA  BOOK  36  of adolescent black females, and more than a fifth of adolescent white and Hispanic females (22 percent and 21 percent, respectively) reported that they had eaten five or more servings of fruits or vegetables on the day preceding the 1999 YRBS. Smaller proportions of adolescent females report drinking more than three glasses of milk a day during the week preceding the survey, however. Nearly 14 percent of white female teens reported this behavior, while less than 11 percent of Hispanic, and less than 8 percent of black adolescent females reported the same. Adolescent females of all three racial/ethnic groups were significantly less likely to drink more than three glasses of milk a day than their male counterparts.237 A majority of white non-Hispanic adolescent females (60 percent) reported that they participated in vigorous physical activity (activity that caused sweating and hard breathing for at least 20 minutes) on at least three of the seven days preceding the administration of the 1999 YRBS. About half of black and Hispanic adolescent females--47 percent of blacks and 50 percent of Hispanics--also reported participating in vigorous physical activity. A smaller share of both Hispanic (17 percent) and white (18 percent) adolescent females than of black (26 percent) adolescent females reported participating in moderate physical activity (that is, walking or bicycling for at least 30 minutes) on 5 or more of the 7 days preceding the 1999 YRBS.237  Elderly Women of Color The elderly population generally is defined as persons 65 years of age and older, with persons ages 65 to 74 years referred to as the ""younger-old,"" persons ages 75 to 84 years as ""old,"" and persons ages 85 years and older as the ""older-old.""98 Despite this convention, persons may be recognized as elderly at widely divergent ages, as young as 40 years of age for many Southeast Asian subgroups and some American Indian/Alaska Native populations.98 This recognition reflects the fact that as early as ages 45 or 55, many American Indians, for example, have physical, emotional, and social impairments characteristic of the general U.S. population 65 years of age and older. In addition, three times as many American Indians/ Alaska Natives as persons in the general population die before reaching the age of 45.10 In one survey among American Indians in Los Angeles, the median age for men and women who were considered elders was 58 years.16 During the previous century, the elderly population of the United States increased more than tenfold, from 3.1 million in 1900 (about one in every 25 Americans)  to nearly 35 million in 2000 (about one of every eight Americans).40 Although the 65-year-old-and-older population historically has grown faster than the general population, this did not hold true between 1990 and 2000, reflecting the relatively small number of people who were born during the Depression in the late 1920s and 1930s.40 Although whites dominate the elderly population at present, their share is projected to decline over the next 50 years as the numbers of other racial/ethnic elderly increase.247 In 1980, members of racial/ethnic populations were more than 10 percent of the elderly population, with their share increasing to 13 percent in 1990;248 in 2000, racial/ethnic subpopulations were estimated to be more than 16 percent of the elderly.249 By 2050, members of racial/ethnic groups are projected to be a third of the elderly.247 Of the nearly 35 million elderly in 2000, an estimated 29 million, or 84 percent, were white nonHispanic. Non-Hispanic blacks (2.8 million) were 8 percent of the elderly population, with Hispanics (2.1 million), Asians and Pacific Islanders (700,000), and American Indians/Alaska Natives (140,000) accounting for 6 percent, 2 percent, and 0.4 percent shares, respectively.249 By the year 2020, the share of white non-Hispanics among the elderly is projected to fall to 77 percent, with the share of black non-Hispanics increasing to more than 9 percent, Hispanics also increasing to nearly 9 percent, Asians and Pacific Islanders increasing to 4 percent, and American Indians/Alaska Natives increasing to 0.5 percent of the population 65 years of age and older.250 In the year 2050, whites are projected to be more than 64 percent of the elderly, with Hispanics more than 16 percent, non-Hispanic blacks 12 percent, Asians and Pacific Islanders nearly 7 percent, and American Indians/Alaska Natives 0.6 percent of this population.247 The Hispanic elderly are expected to grow the most rapidly, from an estimated 2 million in 2000 to more than 13 million by 2050.249 There is considerable variation in the number and proportions of elderly in the states and regions of the United States. For example, more than 18 percent of Florida's population was older than the age of 65 in 1998. Although the more populous states of California and New York have a larger number of adults aged 65 years and older, the older adult populations in Pennsylvania and Rhode Island (both nearly 16 percent) are a greater proportion of those states' populations. More than 12 million elderly live in the South, comprising close to 13 percent of the population in that region, while the 7 million elderly residing in   FACTORS  AFFECTING  THE  HEALTH  OF  WOMEN  OF  COLOR  the Northeast make up slightly more than 14 percent of that region's population.251 Because of residence patterns noted earlier for the various racial/ethnic populations, elderly persons of color would be expected to reside primarily in the South and West. Into the middle of the 21st century, the population 80 years and older--those most likely to need health care and economic and physical support--is projected to be the fastest growing segment of the elderly population, increasing from about 7 million people in 1990 to more than 31 million in 2050.247 The share of whites among the elderly subpopulation 80 years of age and older also is expected to decrease--from 88 percent in 1990 to almost 69 percent in 2050--while the shares of racial/ethnic populations are expected to increase. The Hispanic population 80 years of age and older, as a share of all persons 80 years of age and older, is expected to quadruple over that period, from 3 percent to nearly 15 percent; the corresponding share among the Asian and Pacific Islander elderly is projected to grow from 1 percent in 1990 to nearly 6 percent in 2050. The black population 80 years and older is projected to comprise more than 10 percent of this elderly subpopulation, up from 7 percent in 1990. The proportion of the elderly population 80 years of age and older that is American Indian/Alaska Native is expected to change very little. Although projected to double, this increase is from only 0.3 percent in 1990 to 0.6 percent in 2050.247,248  Natives prefer to ""age in place"" as do many elderly, and a sizable elderly population is found among the majority of American Indians/Alaska Natives who live in urban areas.24 The American Indian/Alaska Native population 80 years of age and older is growing, with the projection that this age cohort will increase from 18 percent of all American Indian/Alaska Native elderly in 1990 to nearly 37 percent in 2050.247,248 This increase among the older-old would mean that greater numbers of younger American Indians/Alaska Natives in their 50s and 60s will have surviving elders. The Parent Support Ratio (number of persons aged 80 and older per 100 persons ages 50 to 64) for American Indians/Alaska Natives will more than triple, from 11 to 38.248 NATIVE HAWAIIANS OR  OTHER PACIFIC ISLANDERS  Demographics AMERICAN INDIANS OR  ALASKA NATIVES  The elderly (65 years of age and older) were a small share of the American Indian/Alaska Native population in both 1990 and 2000--only 6 percent, which was less than half the share of the elderly among non-Hispanic whites at that time.2,230 Among American Indian/Alaska Native women, the elderly were a similar share also in both 1990 and 2000--7 percent.2,230 Younger-old women (65 to 74 years) were 4 percent of all American Indian/Alaska Native females in 2000. In addition, among the total elderly population of American Indian/Alaska Natives, women were 57 percent.2 Most elderly American Indians/Alaska Natives live in the South and West, as does the majority of this population under age 65. Three in four American Indian elderly lived in Western and Southern states, with 40 percent in Oklahoma, California, and Arizona combined.248 Contrary to popular belief, most elderly American Indians/Alaska Natives do not return to their reservations as they age. American Indians/Alaska  In 1990, the elderly were 5 percent of the total Native Hawaiian population and 3 percent of the total Samoan population.230 Elderly Native Hawaiian women constituted 6 percent of all Native Hawaiian women, while the younger elderly Native Hawaiian women (ages 65 to 74) were 4 percent of this total female population.230 Among all elderly Native Hawaiians, however, 57 percent were women. Most elderly Native Hawaiians and Samoans live in the South and West. The distribution of the elderly Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander population counted in the 2000 Census was very similar to that of the Native Hawaiian population counted in 1990.2 The population 65 years and older was slightly greater than 5 percent of all Native Hawaiians or Other Pacific Islanders, with elderly women a slightly larger share (6 percent) of all Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander women. Younger elderly women (ages 65 to 74 years) were nearly 4 percent of all these women, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander women were a majority (55 percent) of this entire elderly population. HISPANICS OR  37  LATINOS  Elderly persons constituted 5 percent of the U.S. Hispanic population in both 1990 and 2000.2,248 As does the population younger than 65 years of age, the Hispanic elderly primarily live in the South and West; three of every four elderly Hispanics live in these regions. In 1990, nearly half of the Hispanic elderly (49 percent) were of Mexican origin, 15 percent Cuban, 12 percent Puerto Rican, and 25 percent of other Hispanic subgroups. Almost 40 percent of older Hispanics report speaking no English, although more than a quarter report good English skills.252   WOMEN  OF  COLOR  HEALTH  DATA  BOOK  Part of this limited English proficiency relates to age at immigration, with a sizable proportion of Hispanics, particularly Cubans, having immigrated to the United States at age 55 years and older. The population of elders 80 years and older is projected to grow from 19 percent of all Hispanic elderly in 1990 to 34 percent in the year 2050.247,248 Because of this growth, the Parent Support Ratio is projected to more than triple for Hispanics over this period, from 11 to 36. Nearly 6 percent of all Hispanic females were elderly, with about 4 percent considered younger-old (ages 65 to 74) in both 1990 and 2000.2,230 Women also are the majority of all elderly Hispanics. They constituted 59 percent of the population 65 years and older and 62 percent of the population ages 75 years and older in both years. BLACK OR  Looking at Asian Americans alone in 2000, 8 percent of this population was elderly, and nearly 9 percent of all Asian women were elderly.2,230 Women are 58 percent of all Asians 65 years of age and older and constitute roughly equivalent shares of the elderly subpopulations 65 to 74 years of age (57 percent) and 75 years of age and older (58 percent).  Access to Health Care Elderly women of color share several characteristics with all elderly women. First, elderly women of color outnumber elderly men of color. Among the general population of all ages the sex ratio (males per 100 females) was 96 men per 100 women.40 This ratio declines to 82 for persons ages 65 to 74 years, and to 69 for the 75- to 84-year-old cohort. The sex ratio for the population 85 years old and older is 49 males per 100 females, nearly half that of the general population.40 Although the sex ratios among the major racial/ethnic elderly subpopulations in 1990 are less than 100, they range from 62 elderly black men per 100 elderly black women to 82 elderly Asian men per 100 elderly Asian women.248 The sex ratio for African Americans ages 40 to 44 is similar to the sex ratio for white Americans ages 60 to 64.114 The higher sex ratio for elderly Asians reflects the historical gender imbalance among Asian immigrants to the United States, with Asian men often migrating alone initially.187 Second, elderly women of color are more likely to be widowed than are elderly men of color. These differences are striking among even the younger-old years (65 to 74), but become more pronounced for women of color in older age groups. For example, 48 percent of black women 65 to 74 years of age were widowed, compared to 19 percent of black males. Sixty-four percent of black women 75 to 84 years of age were widowed, versus 38 percent of black males.248 In 1998, more than 77 percent of women of all races ages 85 or older were widows.249 Widowed women often are impoverished because of the loss of the financial support of their husbands.253 Third and finally, the longer women of color live, the more likely they are to be affected by chronic illness, disability, and dependency, as is true among all elderly women. As one example, when compared with white elderly women, elderly black women are more likely to be widowed or separated and to have at least three medical problems, usually among this set--hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular events.114 In addition to the characteristics shared with all elderly women, the health of elderly women of color  AFRICAN AMERICANS  38  The elderly were 8 percent of the entire black population in both 1990 and 2000, with more than half of these persons living in Southern states.2,248 As with other racial/ethnic groups, the older-old population is the fastest growing segment of the black elderly. Two in ten elderly blacks were 80 years and older in 1990, and this proportion could increase to more than three in ten by the year 2050.247 This population growth could cause the Parent Support Ratio for blacks to increase from 16 (persons 80 years of age and older per every 100 persons 50 to 64 years of age) in 1990 to 27 by the middle of the next century. Elderly black women (65 years and older) were 10 percent of the black female population in both 1990 and 2000, slightly more than the 8 percent share that all the elderly were of the entire black population.2,230 In 2000, the majority of black elderly females (54 percent) were younger-old (65 to 74 years), and these younger-old black women were 59 percent of all blacks who were ages 65 to 74 years. Females were 62 percent of all elderly blacks but 66 percent of elderly blacks ages 75 years and older. ASIAN AMERICANS Among Asians and Pacific Islanders in 1990, 6 percent of the population was elderly, and 55 percent of these elderly lived in three states--California, Hawaii, and Washington.187,248 As with other elderly populations, persons ages 80 and older are the fastest growing segment, projected to increase from 16 percent of all elderly Asians and Pacific Islanders in 1990 to nearly 33 percent in 2050. Consistent with this growth, the ratio of persons ages 80 years and older per 100 persons ages 50 to 64 years (the Parent Support Ratio) is expected to more than triple, from nine to 34.248   FACTORS  AFFECTING  THE  HEALTH  OF  WOMEN  OF  COLOR  reflects the cumulative effects of living in a society in which they often faced disadvantages because of their color. These disadvantages are reflected in limited resources available throughout their lives to meet health care and other needs.254 Wray (1992) has found that socioeconomic status is indeed a notable factor in health differences between blacks and whites older than 55 years of age, in particular.98 The greater proportions of households headed by women of color (compared to white women) in all age groups, combined with the greater incidence of poverty among these female-headed households (relative to households headed by males) suggest that as women of color age and those with spouses become widows, the proportion of impoverished women of color would only increase. Recent data support this reasoning. Among unmarried women 65 years of age and older, black and Hispanic women are more likely than white women to be poor or near poor.255 More than a third of unmarried black (36 percent) and Hispanic (34 percent) elderly women were poor and about half of each group (46 percent of black women and 51 percent of Hispanic women) were either poor or near-poor. These figures contrast with nearly a third (31 percent) of unmarried elderly white women being either poor or near-poor. The lack of social and psychological coping resources is often accompanied by a physical lack of facilities, such as the limited availability of skilled and intermediate- to long-term care facilities on American Indian/Alaska Native reservations.24 Currently, few such facilities exist among the nearly 300 American Indian/Alaska Native reservations. This shortage means that most American Indian/ Alaska Native elderly must be cared for within the communities in which they live, regardless if they have the resources to use such facilities.11 Like elderly American Indians/Alaska Natives, elderly Hispanics are more likely to be cared for within Hispanic communities than in nursing homes. The strength and centrality of family values are noted to explain this.252 However, because more acculturated Hispanic families provide lower levels of informal support to the aged, this may change as the number of Hispanics in the United States and their length of exposure to and influence by American culture grow. Thus,a future need for increased access to nursing home and to home health care may exist for the Hispanic elderly.252 Similarly, black American patients and families currently are more likely to prefer formal services in the home to a post-hospital institutional placement.256  Since black elders have been found to enter posthospital home care with higher levels of physical and cognitive impairment and to have care givers with more limitations than white elders, the ability of this elderly population to avoid nursing home placement also may be limited in the future. The preference for in-home services is related to the perception among black elders and their families that services located outside of black communities are not culturally compatible with the needs of these elders. Reluctance to use out-of-home facilities often results in black elders not using services they need or are entitled to.254 The change of roles for elders vis--vis younger persons within Asian families that have migrated to the United States has implications both for the living arrangements of and access to care among elders. Although Asian elders may help with child care or perform household duties for their families, they no longer can offer financial support, land, or other material goods as they would have in their homelands. Thus, as the case of Chinese elders illustrates, few live with their children, who have left the central cities in which the families first settled. Instead most Chinese elderly remain in Chinatowns where their needs for social interaction and health care services are easily met.257 Greater future unmet need both for health insurance and for health care services thus might be anticipated among elderly women of color than among elderly white women. Currently, though, racial/ethnic elders report lower rates of utilization than whites, despite their greater per capita needs for health care services.98 Among elderly women enrolled in Medicare, access to health care services varies by race. Ten percent of African American elders with Medicare coverage reported delays in receipt of health care due to cost, along with 7 percent of Hispanics and 5 percent of whites.249 These findings may relate to the degree of poverty among women of color who are enrolled in Medicare. In 1999, while only 24 percent of the 14.7 million white women who were Medicare beneficiaries had incomes less than $10,000, more than double this share of the 1.8 million African American female beneficiaries (56 percent) and of the 1.2 million Latina beneficiaries (58 percent) reported incomes at this level.258 Lack of insurance, while not related to delays in receipt of care by these Medicare populations, is related to reduced access to services among elderly women of color who may be ineligible for federal health insurance. While 96 percent of all women ages 65 years and older reported having Medicare coverage, only 88 percent of Mexican Americans, 77 percent of Puerto Ricans, and 87 percent of Cuban Americans in  39   WOMEN  OF  COLOR  HEALTH  DATA  BOOK  40  this same age group reported this coverage.259 Similar lacks of coverage would be expected among other racial/ethnic groups with large immigrant populations. Because Medicare does not cover all the health expenses incurred by the elderly population, many choose to supplement Medicare with private insurance, Medicaid, or other types of insurance. Supplemental insurance coverage and type of coverage, however, differ by race. Seventy-four percent of the white elderly have a combination of Medicare and private insurance, more than twice the percent of blacks, Hispanics, and Asian Americans with this same combination (32 percent, 30 percent, and 30 percent, respectively). Elderly of color are substantially more likely to have Medicare coverage--either alone or in combination with Medicaid; about two-thirds of each of the groups mentioned has this coverage.87 Other barriers to care are sociocultural and political. For example, because they ascribe ill health and debility to the normal aging process, American Indians/Alaska Natives may be less likely than others to seek care for conditions that are treatable and curable.24 This ascription by itself may constitute a barrier to care. In addition, elderly American Indians/Alaska Natives often lack trust in medical care that is not indigenous. Urban American Indians are unwilling to endure lengthy waits at non-indigenous clinics to get care because of their cultural perceptions that ""many mainstream attitudes are intolerably rude.""16 Behaviors such as getting right down to business, addressing strangers in loud, confident tones, and frequently interrupting speakers increase social distance between elderly American Indians/Alaska Natives and non-American Indian/ Alaska Native professionals. The ""blatant racism"" and the ""pernicious effects of stereotyping"" that elderly American Indians/Alaska Natives have encountered in their years of seeking care also become barriers to seeking care in their later lives.16 They also may have had the lifelong experience of being turned away from public clinics whose staff incorrectly insist that the Indian Health Service is the sole agency responsible for their care.16 In one study, older American Indians reported that they ""fear non-Indian health professionals, do not expect to be treated fairly by them, and anticipate adverse contact experiences.""16 Attitudes and experiences such as these underlie the Survey of American Indians and Alaska Natives (SAIAN) findings that only 66 percent of American Indian/Alaska Native women ages 60 years and older had ever had a breast exam, compared to 86 percent among all U.S. women that age.260 Similarly, only 17 percent  of American Indian/Alaska Native women ages 60 and older reported ever having had a mammogram, while 38 percent of all U.S. women in this age group reported ever having had this test.260 Similar sociocultural and political barriers interfere with the access of elderly black women in the rural South to health care services. For example, elderly black women in rural North Carolina reported feeling ""distanced"" from the local health care system and often allowed this feeling to translate into delay or avoidance of breast cancer screening or other preventive services.261 This avoidance of breast cancer screening by elderly, rural black women contrasts with the national finding that elderly black women are the most likely to get mammograms. In 1994, 61 percent of non-Hispanic black women ages 65 and older reported having had a mammogram within the past two years. This exceeds the almost 55 percent of non-Hispanic white, and 48 percent of Hispanic elderly women who reported being screened during the same period.249 Although poverty also is a factor in this lack of access to preventive services, it is not the entire explanation. One legacy of the history of official as well as de facto discrimination within the rigidly segregated health care systems of the Old South is that older black women continue to perceive an unwelcoming attitude within predominantly white health care systems. Black elders often turn to kin and friends rather than to the local health care system for support and information.262 Even if elderly black women get into the health care system to see providers, diagnosing and treating their conditions become complicated by communication and scientific barriers. Communication styles developed by black elders as coping mechanisms for functioning in a racist society may interfere with the process of sharing information with providers to enable them to diagnose medical conditions. Black elders may be reluctant to offer information about themselves or their medical histories, and they may be difficult to engage in a medical encounter.254 They also may be hesitant to report that treatments are not satisfactory for fear of being ignored or receiving retaliation. In addition, conditions among the black elderly sometimes are misdiagnosed because most standard medical texts do not include discussions of the way skin color may affect the presentation or manifestation of disease.254 Because pressure sores or jaundice may manifest differently in patients with darker skin tones, potentially significant conditions may not be detected until they are in advanced stages or benign conditions may be diagnosed as being more serious than they really are.   FACTORS  AFFECTING  THE  HEALTH  OF  WOMEN  OF  COLOR  Although the inability to speak English constitutes a major barrier for elderly Asian women when seeking health care, it is not the only impediment. Elderly Asian women who speak limited English may only know how to describe their pains or distress in their native languages. To save face or prevent conflict, these women may answer ""yes"" when they really do not understand something and, thus, agree to a treatment plan but not comply with it.257 Many Asian elderly believe that the healer is supposed to be able to make a diagnosis without much discussion and with little or no physical contact. Physicians who ask too many questions, need too many tests, or suggest probabilities (rather than guarantees) of outcomes are likely to lose credibility among these elderly. This loss may result in premature discontinuation of therapies prescribed by western medicine and the failure to acknowledge the use of traditional medicines for fear the provider will be angry, refuse to treat them, or cause their medicinal plants to be taken away from them.257 The perception of illness by elderly Asian Americans, which focuses primarily on symptoms such as pain, weakness, dizziness, or nausea, also can serve as a barrier to seeking care.187 This perception of illness makes it difficult for Asian Americans to conceptualize--and thus seek treatment for--diseases such as cancer, hypertension, or diabetes mellitus. Symptoms are not viewed as possible indicators of a chronic or degenerative disease, but rather as a disruption in the balance of ""chi,"" or life energy. For example, a study in Boston's Chinatown revealed that no word for Alzheimer's disease exists in any Chinese language. This is because Alzheimer's is conceptualized differently by the Chinese.263 Another example is the difficulty older Asian American women experience in the conception of illness in the female reproductive organs.187 This may partially explain the low percentages of Asian American women who report getting mammograms and Pap smears. Cultural masking of the breasts and vagina after menopause often result in modesty and a deferment of examination of these organs.187 This failure to seek preventive care is reflected in the fact that in 1991, a somewhat lower share (two-thirds) of Asian women 65 years of age and older reported having had a checkup within the past year, compared to 68 percent of white and 74 percent of black elderly women.208 Hispanics were the only group of elderly women who reported a smaller share (60 percent) having had a checkup within the past year. Asian women ages 65 years and older (83 percent) also were less likely to report having their blood pressure  measured within the past year than other women (87 percent white, 85 percent Hispanic, and 90 percent black elderly women) and most likely to report (7 percent) never having their blood pressure checked or having had it checked three or more years ago.208  Health Assessment Elderly people of color, especially Hispanics and African Americans, are known to have a greater number of functional disabilities (as measured by restricted activity and bed-disability days) than are elderly whites of the same ages.98 In 1996, Hispanic and black elderly were nearly twice as likely as white and Asian American elderly to rate their health as fair or poor.87 Activity limitations due to arthritis increase with age for all women, but are especially severe for African American and American Indian/Alaska Native women among the 2.5 million women 65 years of age and older reporting this condition.264 In addition, although the age-specific incidence of hip fractures in black women is about half that of white women, the rates in black women are considerable and are associated with higher subsequent rates of disability and even mortality.265 Osteoporosis, often the cause of hip fractures among elderly women, is widely known to be more common in Asian women than in other racial/ethnic groups of elderly women.257 Although the decrease in calcium absorption with age is implicated in the incidence of osteoporosis among Asian women, the lack of exercise among this subpopulation also is a causal factor. American Indian/Alaska Native women ages 65 and older included in the SAIAN reported greater incidence than all United States women of gallbladder disease and of diabetes mellitus, two chronic conditions that may contribute to functional disability and impairment.266 As it was in earlier adult years, diabetes continues to be a problem among black and Hispanic women 65 years of age and older. Among black women, diabetes can be termed epidemic, with one in four black women older than 55 years of age with the disease, double the rate among white women.267 Mexican American (15 percent) and Puerto Rican (16 percent) women ages 45 to 74 years have a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus than both non-Hispanic white (6 percent) and black women (11 percent).259 Hypertension, especially among Filipino women, and high levels of cholesterol are two major causes of morbidity among Asian women.187 Racial/ethnic elders have been found to be somewhat more likely than other elderly persons to experience psychosocial distress.268 This is especially true for those elderly people of color who have experienced  41   WOMEN  OF  COLOR  HEALTH  DATA  BOOK  42  lives with low incomes, minimal education, substandard housing, and a general lack of opportunity, and thus have fewer social and psychological coping resources available to them. At the same time, the accuracy of reports of psychiatric illnesses among African Americans has been questioned.114 Diagnostic biases have been found to result in greater likelihood of a diagnosis of schizophrenia among blacks than is warranted upon re-examination of patients. Erroneous diagnoses are attributed to the social distance between the treating psychiatrists and the patients, the presence of racism, and unconscious fears related to working with patients different from themselves. These erroneous diagnoses often result in the increased use of restraints and higher doses of drugs being prescribed for black elderly patients (than for white elderly patients) with mental health problems.114 Effective responses to mental problems vary by racial/ethnic group. For example, in one study family help has been found to buffer psychological distress among elderly blacks, while higher levels of family interaction were associated with greater depression among elderly Mexican Americans.268 The major causes of death for racial/ethnic elderly subpopulations include diabetes and hypertension, which are prominent as causes of deaths among African American, Hispanic, and American Indian/ Alaska Native elders.98 The six leading causes of death in 1995 for elderly American Indians/Alaska Natives were heart disease, cancers, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular disorders, pneumonia and influenza, and accidents.24 Cancer survival rates among elderly American Indians/Alaska Natives are the lowest among all United States subpopulations. In one state survey, elderly Hispanics (both male and female) were found to have lower death rates  than elderly non-Hispanic whites (both male and female) for almost all causes, especially diseases of the heart, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and allied conditions, and cancers.252 Older Hispanics had higher death rates due to diabetes mellitus, motor vehicle accidents, kidney ailments (such as nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and nephrosis), and chronic liver disease and cirrhosis than did non-Hispanic whites. Although age-adjusted mortality rates generally are lower for Asian Americans than for whites, there is great variety in the rates reported by subgroups of Asians.187 Asian and Pacific Islander women 65 years of age and older have a death rate from suicide (more than eight per 100,000) that is four times that of elderly black women (two per 100,000) and 1.3 times that of elderly white women (more than six per 100,000). Suicide rates among elderly Chinese American and Japanese American women, in particular, are known to exceed suicide rates among non-Asian women of the same ages.187 Social isolation is posited as an explanation for this, although health problems are mentioned most often as the reason for suicide when suicide notes are left.269 Death rates among some racial/ethnic elderly populations differ from those among whites due in part to the ""mortality crossover effect"" observed among African Americans and American Indians/Alaska Natives. The mortality crossover effect is a pattern of selective survival in which the least robust African Americans and American Indians/Alaska Natives die at earlier ages and hardier ones survive to much older ages.98 This explains why life expectancy for whites exceeds that for African Americans at age 65, but the reverse becomes true around age 75--that is, life expectancy for African Americans exceeds that for whites.98   REFERENCES  1 Bureau of the Census.

Web Site (full text):    http://www.econ.ag.gov/epubs/pdf/aib744/aib744.PDF   NAL CALL NO:  1Ag84Abno.744    Abstract:    Educating low-income women about the advantages of breastfeeding their babies increases the number who breastfeed. This report summarizes the results of four projects that focused primarily on promoting breastfeeding, which is considere    d to be the most healthful and beneficial feeding method for most infants. Research has shown that breastfeeding improves the general health, growth, and development of infants and significantly reduces the risk of several health problems both during earl    y life and in later years. Lower income women have been less likely to breastfeed than higher income women. One step USDA has taken to promote breastfeeding is the ES/WIC Nutrition Education Initiative. This combines the strengths of two nutrition program    s for low-income families - the Cooperative Extension System's Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program and the Food and Nutrition Service's Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children. This report shows that breastfeeding     education before delivery increases the initiation of breastfeeding among  low-income women. The results also indicate that breastfeeding support soon after delivery increases the duration of breastfeeding.   Target Audience:  WIC Professionals    "" Counseling and Motivational Videotapes Increase Duration of Breast-feeding in African-American WIC Participants who Initiate Breast-feeding. "" Susan M Gross, et al. Journal of the American Dietetic Association,  Feb 1998. v. 98 (2) p. 143-148.   NAL CALL NO:  389.8 Am34   Abstract:  Objective: To evaluate the relative effects introducing motivational videotapes and/or peer counseling in Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) clinics serving African-American women have on breast-    feeding duration. Design: Experimental intervention study. Pregnant women were enrolled at or before 24 weeks gestation and were followed up until postpartum week 16. Women were interviewed at enrollment, 7 to 10 days, 8 weeks. and 16 weeks postpartum. Su    bjects/setting: One hundred fifteen African-American WIC participants who initiated breast-feeding and who had been enrolled in 1 of 4 clinics. Intervention: Two-by-two factorial design in which 4 clinics were randomly assigned to receive either no interv    ention, a motivational video package intervention, a peer-counseling intervention, or both interventions. Main outcome measures: Breast-feeding duration in weeks and relative risk ratios for breast-feeding cessation before 16 weeks postpartum. Statistical     analysis performed: Contingency table analysis, including chi 2 tests and log-rank tests; multivariate analysis using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Results: A higher proportion of women were breast-feeding at 8 and 16 weeks postpartum in     the intervention clinics than in the control clinic. The proportion of women reporting breast-feeding declined at 8 and 16 weeks postpartum, but the rate of decline was slower in the 3 intervention clinics than in the control clinic. Being younger than 19     years of age or older than 25 years of age, having a male infant and returning to work or school all negatively affected breast-feeding duration, whereas previous breast-feeding experience positively influenced breast-feeding duration. Applications/concl    usions: WIC-based peer counselor support and motivational videos can positively affect the duration of breast-feeding among African-American women. WIC nutritionists and other health professionals in contact with this population should expand their effort    s toward promoting increased duration of breast-feeding.

Journal of the American Dietetic Association,  Apr 1997. v. 97 (4) p. 379-385.   NAL CALL NO:  389.8Am34   Abstract:  Objectives: To determine whether breast-feeding of infants enrolled in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) is associated with a reduction in Medicaid expenditures during the first six months o    f life; if so, to determine whether the reduction represents a positive economic benefit to society when WIC costs for these infants and their mothers are considered. Design: Cohorts of exclusively breast-fed and formula-fed infants were tracked for 6 mon    ths to compare WIC costs and Medicaid expenditures. Subjects: The sample consisted of 406 healthy infants who were breast-fed exclusively for at least 3 months and 470 healthy infants who were formula-fed exclusively. The infants, born between August 1, 1    993, and December 31, 1993, were enrolled in WIC and Medicaid. Cost and benefit measures: WIC costs included redeemed WIC vouchers for formula and foods for infants and mothers, plus administrative expenses for 6 months, minus manufacturers' rebates for f    ormula. Benefit was determined from Medicaid expenditures for health care initiated in the first 180 days of each infant's life. Statistical and benefit-cost analyses: Economic benefit was calculated as net benefit and as benefit-cost ratios. Regression t    echniques were used to estimate Medicaid expenditures associated with breast-feeding, adjusted for demographic and prenatal care variables. Results: Compared with formula-feeding, breast-feeding each infant enrolled in WIC saved $478 in WIC costs and Medi    caid expenditures during the first 6 months of the infant's life, or $161 after consideration of the formula manufacturer's rebate. A Medicaid cost saving of $112 per infant was realized by the breast-feeding cohort, and Medicaid pharmacy reimbursement co    sts for breast-fed infants were significantly lower--half that of formula-fed infants. Applications: The promotion of breast-feeding among low-income populations through nutrition programs such as WIC is an effective cost-containment measure.

NAL CALL NO:  389.8Am34   Abstract:   Objective: To determine the potential cost savings for four social service programs if breast-feeding rates increased among women in California. Design: Cost-savings analysis. Subjects/setting: Among women in California. In this populati    on, breast-feeding is currently uncommon, and use on contraceptives is minimal. Main outcome measures: Savings were based on estimates of the resulting decrease in infant morbidity, maternal fertility, and formula purchases (Special Supplemental Nutrition     Program for Women, Infants, and Children) if women breast-fed each child for at least 6 months. Costs were projected over a 7.5-year period and future values were discounted with annual interest rates of 2% or 4%. Results: Substantial savings estimates w    ere associated with breast-feeding for all four programs. The total projected savings over the 7.5-year period ranges from $3,442 to $4,944(4% discount) to $4,475 to $6,060 (0% discount) per family enrolled in all four programs. This translates into an es    timated yearly savings of between $459 and $659 (4% discount) and $597 and $808 (0% discount) per family. Applications: Although health care providers generally accept that breast-feeding is the preferred method for feeding infants, many still view the ch    oice as a neutral one that is, they consider low breast-feeding rates in the United States a cultural choice with no cost to society. This analysis provides evidence that breast-feeding is economically advantageous for individuals and society.

Journal of Nutrition Education, Mar/Apr 1995. v. 27 (2) p. 69-74.   NAL CALL NO:  TX341.J6    Abstract:    The very low rate of breastfeeding among Hmong immigrants to the U.S. is of concern to the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). The objective of this intervention was to increase breastfeeding initia    tion by specifically targeting attitudes towards infant feeding among Hmong WIC participants. The intervention group (n = 63) was compared with a control group (n = 349) of women who had delivered infants within the previous 8 months. The intervention con    sisted of a prenatal class and individual meeting, immediate support within 3 days postpartum, and a final interview 3 to 6 weeks postpartum. In the intervention group, 24 women (38.1%) initiated breastfeeding and 11 (17.5%) were still breastfeeding at th    e final interview, whereas in the control group, 19 women (5.4%) reported breastfeeding at their first postpartum WIC interview at 3 to 6 weeks postpartum (17.5% vs. 5.4%; p = .002). Older mothers were more likely to breastfeed. Primary reasons for choosi    ng formula included the availability of WIC vouchers and the perception that formula feeding was more convenient. Barriers to breastfeeding initiation included delayed first breastfeed (mean = 20 hours postpartum), separation of infant and mother, provisi    on of supplements in the hospital, and gifts of formula at discharge. This study illustrates that a short-term, targeted intervention can have a positive effect on the initiation of breastfeeding.    Target Audience:  WIC Professionals       C.

FARMERS' MARKET/FRUITS AND VEGETABLE CONSUMPTION (in order by year)     "" Using Peer Educators in Nutrition Intervention Research: Lessons Learned from the Maryland WIC 5 A Day Promotion Program.""  Jean Anliker. Journal of Nutrition Education,  Dec 1999. v. 31 (6) p. 347-354.   NAL CALL NO:   TX341.J6   Abstract:  Peer educators have been used for many years in nutrition education interventions. With the increasing importance of documented impacts, the role of peers is expanding to include research activities. Twenty-seven peer educators were hired to deliver the Maryland WIC 5-A-Day Promotion Program in three pilot and 16 full-scale study WIC sites in Maryland. Their roles included recruiting and enrolling program participants, col    lecting pro- and postsurvey data and process evaluation forms, conducting a series of three 45-minute nutrition education sessions, providing social support, maintaining contact with participants through telephone and mail, and tracking participants throu    gh the course of the program. Peer educators can make valuable contributions to program design, deliver interventions effectively, and provide social support both to participants and to each other. However, peer educators need intensive training, support,     and monitoring for complete and accurate data collection, complete and consistent program delivery, and telephone contacts with participants. Because peer educators face life crises similar to those of their target audiences, special attention is often r    equired for them to remain effective. This paper presents strategies developed as part of the Maryland WIC 5 A Day Program for building the competencies of peer educators working in research.

NAL CALL NO:  389.8 Am34   Abstract:  Objective: The purpose of this analysis was to assess to what extent sociodemographic and psychosocial characteristics predict consumption of fruits and vegetables in women served by the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, I    nfants, and Children (WIC). Design: Baseline survey data were analyzed for women enrolled in the Maryland WIC 5 A Day Promotion Program, a study sponsored by the National Cancer Institute. Sociodemographic variables included age, race, education, marital     status, working status, pregnancy status, and smoking status. Psychosocial variables included self-efficacy, knowledge, attitudes, social support, and perceived barriers to consuming 5 or more servings daily of fruits and vegetables. Subjects/setting: Ana    lyses are based on 3,122 women enrolled at 15 WIC sites in Baltimore and 6 counties in Maryland. Statistical analyses performed: Because psychosocial characteristics were measured on different scales and varied in dispersion, we standardized scores for th    ese variables. Multiple regression analyses were then performed to assess contributions of the sociodemographic variables and the standardized psychosocial variable scores to the variance in consumption of fruits and vegetables. Results: Sociodemographic     variables were not powerful predictors of fruit and vegetable consumption. In contrast, an increase of 1 standard deviation in self-efficacy resulted in a mean increase of 0.76 servings, and an increase of 1 standard deviation in perceived barriers result    ed in a decrease of 0.50 servings. About 21% of the variance in consumption was explained by all of the variables examined. Applications: Dietitians and intervention programs should focus on increasing clients' self-efficacy, positive attitudes, and knowl    edge relating to fruits and vegetables while trying to reduce perceived barriers to consumption of fruits and vegetables.

NAL CALL NO:   TX341.J6   Abstract:     This article describes formative research conducted as part of a study aimed at increasing fruit and vegetable consumption among low-income women enrolled in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (W    IC). Focus group discussions and central location intercept interviews were conducted with WIC participants to answer questions such as (1) What are their food shopping, preparation, and eating habits? (2) What perceptions do they have about fruits and ve    getables? (3) What barriers do they face to increased consumption of fruits and vegetables? and (4) What motivations and messages might be effective in promoting increased consumption? Results indicated that these women, while generally responsible for fo    od shopping and preparation did not cook extensively. They reported many positive perceptions of fruits and vegetables, but also identified barriers to increasing consumption, including lack of availability, time and effort to prepare, and preference for     other foods. Several implications for nutrition interventions were suggested. First, a key motivation for these women was being a good role model for their children suggesting a persuasive appeal to use in interventions. Second, review of the women's curr    ent eating behaviors led to an identification of five specific behaviors that had the most potential for increasing overall consumption. Finally, the findings suggested ways in which nutrition interventions could address each of the barriers identified. <    br>  Target Audience:  WIC Professionals       IV.

Iron is one of the five nutrients targeted by the program, the others being protein, calcium, vitamin A, and vitamin C. Folate and vitamin B-6, along with zinc, were recommended by a 1991 USDA study as nutrients that the program should also target. The data set used, the 1994-96 Continuing Survey of Food Intake by Individuals, reflects the dramatic increase during the 1990's in the number of children in the program.

Objective: A population-based study was conducted to examine the association between early childhood anemia and mild or mod    erate metal retardation at 10 y of age. Design: The present study linked early childhood nutrition data collected by the Special Supplemental Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and school records. Hemoglobin values were used to determine the r    elation between anemia in early life and children's placement in special education classes for mild or moderate mental retardation. Subjects were all participants in the WIC program. A computer program was used to link data from birth, WIC, and school rec    ords. Results: Logistic regression showed an increased likelihood of mild or moderate mental retardation associated with anemia, independent of birth weight, maternal education, sex, race-ethnicity, the mother's age, or the child's age at entry into the W    IC program. Conclusion: These findings support the proposition that efforts to prevent mild and moderate mental retardation should include providing children with adequate nutrition during early childhood.

NAL CALL NO:  151.65 P96.   Abstract:  Objectives: To assess the prevalence of dental caries in a large group of preschool children, to determine the extent to which the children received dental treatment, to examine the association between demographic and socioeconomic factor    s and the prevalence of caries, and to compare these findings with those from previous studies of preschool populations in the United States. Methods: Dental caries exams were performed on 5171 children ages 5 months through 4 years, and a parent or other     caregiver was asked to complete a questionnaire giving information about the child and her or his household. The children were recruited from Head Start programs; Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) nutrition programs; health fairs; and day care centers i    n a representative sample of Arizona communities with populations of more than 1000 people. Results: Of the 994 one-year-old children examined, 6.4% had caries, with a mean dmft (decayed, missing [extracted due to caries], and filled teeth) score of 0.18.     Nearly 20% of the 2-year-olds had caries, with a mean dmft of 0.70. Thirty-five percent of the 3-year-olds had caries, with a mean dmft of 1.35, and 49% of the 4-year-olds had caries, with a mean dmft of 2.36. Children whose caregivers fell into the lowe    st education category had a mean dmft score three times higher than those with caregivers in the highest education category. Children with caregivers in the lowest income category had a mean dmft score four times higher than those with caregivers in the h    ighest category. Children younger than age 3 had little evidence of dental treatment, and most of the children with caries in each age group had no filled or extracted teeth.   Conclusions: The data show that dental caries is highly prevalent in this preschool population, with little of the disease being treated. Timing of diagnostic examinations and prevention strategies for preschool children need to be reconsidered, especiall    y for children identified as having a high risk of caries.

NAL CALL NO:  389.8 Am34   Abstract:   To assess two groups' knowledge of the role of diet in the etiology of dental caries: nutritionists in the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and public health dental hygienists. Design A self-admini    stered survey contained questions about the cause of dental canes, the importance of caries preventive measures, dietary factors linked to dental caries, dietary advice for patients with active dental caries, and diet related topics discussed with clients    . Surveys were sent to all WIC nutritionists and public health dental hygienists in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. Of the 235 surveys mailed, 188 completed surveys composed the final sample. Descriptive tests, means and frequencies, and the chi squared te    st were used to measure differences in nutritionists' and hygienists' responses. One half of the nutritionists and three fourths of the hygienists recognized that dental caries was caused by a bacterial infection. Most dental researchers consider fluoride     exposure and dental sealants to be highly effective caries preventive measures; in contrast, WIC nutritionists and dental hygienists identified oral hygiene as being most important in preventing canes. Frequency of snacking and retentiveness of food in t    he mouth were accurately rated important dietary factors in the development of dental caries by both groups. However, limiting intake of fermentable carbohydrates between meals was not considered the most important dietary advice for clients. Applications    : Results suggest that current research about the role of diet in the prevention of dental caries should be included in both nutrition and dental hygiene curriculums and continuing education courses for these professionals.

NAL CAL NO: TX341.J6   Abstract:  The Families in Transition program (FIT), in collaboration with the University of Maryland School of Medicine, designed and implemented a Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) homeless outreach proje    ct. Staff scheduled regular outreach visits to shelters and soup kitchens to ensure that eligible participants were certified for the WIC program and families were closely followed. Two hundred fourteen homeless clients were certified for the WIC program     during a 1-year period. A nutritional analysis of foods provided by shelters and soup kitchens revealed that participants' daily dietary intakes would be deficient in key nutrients for pregnant and breastfeeding women and children under age 5. This analys    is was based on the assumptions that participants at any given shelter or soup kitchen had access to no food other than that provided by the shelter or kitchen and that participants consumed all foods available at the shelter or soup kitchen. Providing in    tensive nutrition and health education played a key role in ensuring proper use of the WIC food packages. Outreach services are fundamental to effectively serving homeless families through the WIC program.    Target Audience:  WIC Professionals       E.

Design: Longitudinal follow-up of women and their infants who participated in a WIC-based breast-feeding promotion project. Women enrolled prenatally at or before 24 weeks of gestation were followed up until 16 weeks postpartum. Subjects/setting: Two hund    red seventeen African-American WIC participants in an urban area. Methods: Data related to infant feeding practices were collected by interviewers who used a structured questionnaire to determine when nonmilk liquids or solids were introduced to the infan    t. Reported practices were compared with current recommendations. Statistical analysis performed: Contingency table analysis, including x(2) tests, and multivariate analysis using logistic regression. Results: By 7 to 10 days postpartum, approximately a t    hird of infants were receiving some nonmilk liquids or solids; this escalated to 77% by 8 weeks and 93% by 16 weeks postpartum. Women breast-feeding exclusively (ie, not adding nonmilk liquids or solids) were least likely, and women providing mixed feedin    g (breast milk and formula) were more likely, than women feeding formula exclusively to introduce nonmilk liquids and solids at each data collection time period. Applications/conclusions: WIC participants who receive instruction about infant feeding nutri    tion are no more likely than mothers who do not participate in WIC to follow infant feeding guidelines recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics in regard to the time when solids should be introduced to  infants' diet. Our findings suggest the nee    d for WIC to implement more powerful and innovative educational and motivational strategies to help mothers delay the introduction of nonmilk liquids and solid foods until their infants are 4 to 6 months old, as recommended.

NAL CAL NO: TX341.J6   Abstract:   To identify motivational determinants of milk consumption, a major source of prenatal calcium intake, 180 pregnant women drawn from two prenatal clinics in South Carolina were surveyed. Most of them were enrolled in or eligible for the S    pecial Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC Program). The Theory of Planned Behavior was used to design an instrument assessing attitudinal, subjective normative, and perceived control beliefs toward consuming milk. Motivati    onal beliefs explaining milk consumption were first explored using univariate regression (p < .05), and a set of salient beliefs was identified using multiple regression with backward elimination (p < .1). Multiple regression models based upon these     factors explained more than 49% of the variability in motivation for milk consumption (p = .0001). Practical reasons for consuming milk including ""taste"" and ""quench thirst"" and perceived health consequences were among attitudinal beliefs included in the     models. ""Husband/boyfriend,"" ""doctor,"" and ""nurse/WIC/ staff/nutritionist"" were identified as social influences, and perceived confidence in ""keeping milk fresh,"" ""keeping milk at home for me,"" ""buying/getting milk whenever I wanted to,"" and ""being able     to drink two cups a day"" were among perceived control beliefs contributing to the models. These beliefs provide a basis for targeted prenatal educational interventions, which should include strategies addressing all three factors described in the Planned     Behavior model.

NAL CAL NO: 389.8 Am34   Abstract:  Objective: To determine the prevalence of pica during pregnancy, maternal hemoglobin levels at delivery, and the association of pica with 2 adverse pregnancy outcomes: low birth weight and preterm birth. Design: A retrospective cohort stu    dy was conducted using eligible subjects (n=281) from a cross-sectional survey (n=366). Subjects/setting: Mothers aged 16 to 30 years with infants younger than 1 year of age who participated in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants    , and Children (WIC) were interviewed at 4 WIC clinics in Houston and Prairie View, Tex. Medical records from 31 hospitals were abstracted. Main Outcome Measures: Maternal hemoglobin levels at delivery, mean birth weight, and mean gestational age were com    pared for women who reported pica and women who did not. Statistical analyses: chi2 Tests, orthogonal t tests, analysis of variance, and regression analysis were used to test the relationships among study variables. Results: Pica prevalence categorized by     substance was as follows: ice, 53.7%; ice and freezer frost, 14.6%; other substances such as baking soda, baking powder, cornstarch, laundry starch, baby powder, clay, or dirt, 8.2%; and no pica, 23.5%. Women in all 3 pica groups had lower hemoglobin lev    els (mean +/- standard deviation, 114 +/- 12 g/L, 110 +/- 13 g/L, and 113 +/- 12 g/L, respectively) at delivery than women who did not report pica (118 +/- 11 g/L) (P<.01 for all pica groups vs no pica). There were no differences in mean birth weight o    r mean gestational age of infants born to women from the 3 pica groups and the No Pica group. Applications: The findings suggest that pica practices are associated with significantly lower maternal hemoglobin levels at delivery but are not associated with     pregnancy outcomes. Dietitians should ask pregnant women with anemia about pica and should counsel women who report pica regarding the health risks associated with it.

This study was conducted to determine the nutritional status and nutrient intake of low-income pregnant women enrolle    d in the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). The 24-hour recall method, food frequency list, and nutrient analysis were used to determine the dietary intakes of 23 nutrients for 142 pregnant women aged 15 to 37 years.     The results indicate that the recommended allowances for some key essential nutrients such as iron, folacin, zinc, and calcium were not being met through the diet during the gestational period. Nutrition educators, therefore, must emphasize the inclusion     of these nutrients in the diets of this target population.

Summary: To identify recent studies that examine the effectiveness of each WIC nutrition service, we searched relevant databases, such as the National Technical Information Service, Sociological Abstracts, and Wilson Social Science Abstracts. We also cons    ulted with USDA WIC program staff and other program stakeholders including officials from the National Association of WIC Directors. Initially, we identified more than 200 published WIC studies dealing with various aspects of the WIC program. In order to     focus on recent research, we eliminated from consideration research published prior to 1995. We also eliminated any study that did not specifically address the effects of at least one of the three WIC nutrition services, whether nutrition education, breas    tfeeding promotion and support, or referral services. We included research that falls in two general categories: demonstration studies and impact studies. The demonstration studies typically attempt to assess whether special interventions, such as hospita    l visits to promote breastfeeding, more effectively achieve program objectives than the usual WIC services. In contrast, impact studies attempt to determine whether a WIC nutrition service, such as breastfeeding promotion and support, improves WIC partici    pants' outcomes compared to similar individuals who do not participate in the WIC program.

NAL CALL NO:  aTX326.A1U5   Web Site (full text):   http://www.usda.gov/cnpp/FENR.htm   Abstract:  We examine the contribution of the Food Stamp Program (FSP) and the Special Supplemental Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) to the nutrition security and diet quality of low-income participating households. This information ca    n improve future monitoring of the effects of welfare policy reforms. Welfare reform has emphasized moving people from welfare to work modifying or eliminating many former entitlement programs. However, after debate, Federal food assistance programs were     retained as a nutritional safety net, although in some cases access and benefits were restricted. Using historical consumption data (CSFII 1989-91), we examine the hypothesis that participation in the FSP and/or WIC is an important factor in maintaining a    nd improving the diet quality of low-income households. Using USDA's Healthy Eating Index (HEI), as an indicator of overall diet quality, and its 10 component indices, we estimate for the first time overall diet quality effects of changes in FSP and WIC p    articipation and benefit levels. (The HEI permits us to examine diet quality as nutritionists see   some foods consumed  too little and others too much.) Results suggest that both programs contribute significantly to maintaining and improving the nutrit    ional well-being of low-income households, considering both quantity and quality of diet components. We believe the implication is that these food assistance programs help low-income households achieve nutrition security-including improved diet quality-an    d that their support provides a critical safety net to accompany welfare reform.   Target Audience:  WIC Professionals     "" Household participation in the Food Stamp and WIC Programs Increases the Nutrient Intakes of Preschool Children. "" Donald Rose, Jean-Pierre Habicht, and Barbara Devaney.   Journal of Nutrition, Mar 1998. v. 128 (3) p. 548-555.   NAL CALL NO:  389.8 J82    Abstract:  We examined the effects of household participation in the Food Stamp and WIC Nutrition Programs on the nutrient intakes of preschoolers using data from the 1989-1991 Continuing Survey of Food Intake by Individuals. Nonbreastfeeding childr    en, 1-4 y of age, with 3 d of dietary data and whose households had incomes < 130% of the poverty level were included in the study sample (n = 499). Nutrient adequacy ratios for each of 15 nutrients were the dependent variables in multiple regression m    odels that controlled for the following: age, sex and ethnicity of the individual; income, size and location of the household; schooling of the household head; home ownership; school lunch and breakfast participation; and season in which the interview was     conducted. WIC benefits positively influenced (P < 0.05) the intakes of 10 nutrients. For iron and zinc, the average increase due to WIC represented 16.6 and 10.6%, respectively, of the preschooler recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for these nutrien    ts. The same analyses of the Food Stamp Program revealed increases in five nutrients. For iron and zinc, the average increase due to Food Stamps represented 12.3 and 9.2%, respectively, of the preschooler RDA. The effects of the WIC Program on the intakes     of iron and zinc were greater than that of cash income, and neither program affected the intakes of fat, saturated fat or cholesterol.  Note: The RDA have been updated since. For the latest version, refer to: http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/dga/rda.pdf .

American Journal of Agricultural Economics, Aug 1997. v. 79 (3) p. 902-917.   NAL CALL NO:  280.8 J822    Abstract:  A framework is developed to evaluate food assistance programs and is applied to the Farmers' Market Nutrition Program-a program intended to increase consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables (F&V) by providing coupons and information. Be    cause individuals differ, some coupons are unused, some replace existing consumption and simply enhance income, and some induce increased consumption. Results show that coupons alone reduce social welfare because recipients value F&V less than society. Ho    wever, when coupons are used as a lure to distribute information, demand increases. In a household production framework the program is shown to enhance social welfare by correcting a market failure.

Journal of the American Dietetic Association,  July 1997. v. 97 (7) p. 777-782.   NAL CALL NO:  389.8 Am34    Abstract:  The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) began in 1974 after a 2-year pilot program. WIC links food assistance and nutrition education to health care for at-risk persons. The program had approximat    ely 344,000 participants in l975 and has grown to provide services to nearly 6 million participants. Infants born to women who participate in WIC during pregnancy tend to have a slightly higher mean birth weight than those born to women who were eligible     but did not participate in WIC. Higher birth weight has been associated with a slightly higher mean gestational age. The prevalence of low birth weight and very low birth weight among infants and the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia among toddlers and     preschool children is lower for those participating in WIC than for those not participating in WIC.

NAL CALL NO:  389.8 Am34   Abstract:  Objective: To assess consumption of foods from food packages provided by the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIG) among 80 Chinese prenatal WIG recipients living in Oakland or San Francisco, Calif. Design: During a single interview, a food frequency questionnaire was used to assess WIG food consumption by the prenatal patients for the period before and after receipt of WIC vouchers. Setting: The study was conducted at Asian Health     Services, Oakland, and the Chinatown Public Health Center of the San Francisco Department of Public Health in California.  Subjects: Eighty low-income Chinese prenatal women with limited education and limited ability to speak English, aged 121 to 43 years, with gestational stages of 15 to 38 weeks.  Statistical Analyses Performed: Descriptive statistics (frequency and percent distribution) were used to report the findings of the study. Results: Subjects reported that before receiving WIC vouchers, milk, eggs, and juice were the only foods in their WI    C food package that had been consumed frequently (>5 times/week~ in their daily diet Other WIC foods, including cheese, peanut butter, dried beans, and hot and cold cereals, were consumed infrequently (0 to I time/month). Subjects reported that with the a    vailability of WIC vouchers, milk, eggs, and juice remained frequently consumed with 81% to 100% of monthly supply as the most prevalent reported consumption rate. Dried beans and hot and cold cereals were also consumed frequently. Cheese remained poorly     consumed (0% to 20% of the monthly supply). As many as 74 of 80 subjects stated that they had shared foods from their own WIC package, except milk, with their families. The use of any WIC foods provided to other children in the family was not assessed in     this study. Applications: Data from this study indicate that most WIC foods were well used by Chinese prenatal patients. The most notable exception was cheese, which was poorly consumed.    The ready consumption of milk by pregnant Chinese WIC recipients in this study suggests that milk may be readily consumed by these women, even though it is atypical of the Asian diet. The WIC food package for Chinese prenatal patients may be improved by o    mitting cheese and substituting more milk and/or foods such as tofu and dark green leafy vegetables.

Develop a set               of evaluation criteria by which the cultural                appropriateness and the effectiveness of the existing NAGCAT               guidelines when used with a cultural minority                group can be measured; and 2. Describe a process for the               adaptation of future guidelines that are tailored to the                needs of ethnic communities.                The five specific aims of the research project are to: 1.               Examine the extent and nature of child agricultural labor                in farm families of Hmong origin in the Upper Midwest; (the               Hmong, refugees to the United States from Laos in                the 1970s and 1980s, comprise the second largest ethnic               minority in Minnesota.) 2. Investigate                culture-specific health behavior patterns and               culturally-appropriate health promotion methods for farm families                of Hmong origin; 3. Evaluate the NAGCAT for applicability and               appropriateness for farm families of Hmong                origin; 4. Produce recommendations for adapting the Guidelines               to be more culturally appropriate to Hmong                farm families; and 5. Design a health education vehicle that               presents at least three of the NAGCAT guidelines                through messages and in media tailored specifically for Hmong               audiences.                The research design for this non-experimental evaluation study               combines quantitative and qualitative research                methods. The project will use a variety of methods, including               extensive literature review and analysis of                secondary data; semi-structured individual and group               interviews; focus groups; content analysis; and                assessments of childrens' physical and developmental               capabilities.                                Return       to NIOSH Childhood       Agricultural Injury Prevention Initiative Homepage

This report summarizes the results of four projects that focused primarily on promoting breastfeeding, which is considere        d to be the most healthful and beneficial feeding method for most infants. Research has shown that breastfeeding improves the general health, growth, and development of infants and significantly reduces the risk of several health problems both during earl        y life and in later years. Lower income women have been less likely to breastfeed than higher income women. One step USDA has taken to promote breastfeeding is the ES/WIC Nutrition Education Initiative. This combines the strengths of two nutrition program        s for low-income families - the Cooperative Extension System's Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program and the Food and Nutrition Service's Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children. This report shows that breastfeeding         education before delivery increases the initiation of breastfeeding among   low-income women. The results also indicate that breastfeeding support soon after delivery increases the duration of breastfeeding.

Design: Experimental intervention study. Pregnant women were enrolled at or before 24 weeks gestation and were followed up until postpartum week 16. Women were interviewed at enrollment, 7 to 10 days, 8 weeks. and 16 weeks postpartum. Su        bjects/setting: One hundred fifteen African-American WIC participants who initiated breast-feeding and who had been enrolled in 1 of 4 clinics. Intervention: Two-by-two factorial design in which 4 clinics were randomly assigned to receive either no interv        ention, a motivational video package intervention, a peer-counseling intervention, or both interventions. Main outcome measures: Breast-feeding duration in weeks and relative risk ratios for breast-feeding cessation before 16 weeks postpartum. Statistical         analysis performed: Contingency table analysis, including chi 2 tests and log-rank tests; multivariate analysis using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Results: A higher proportion of women were breast-feeding at 8 and 16 weeks postpartum in         the intervention clinics than in the control clinic. The proportion of women reporting breast-feeding declined at 8 and 16 weeks postpartum, but the rate of decline was slower in the 3 intervention clinics than in the control clinic. Being younger than 19         years of age or older than 25 years of age, having a male infant and returning to work or school all negatively affected breast-feeding duration, whereas previous breast-feeding experience positively influenced breast-feeding duration. Applications/concl        usions: WIC-based peer counselor support and motivational videos can positively affect the duration of breast-feeding among African-American women. WIC nutritionists and other health professionals in contact with this population should expand their effort        s toward promoting increased duration of breast-feeding.     Target Audience:  WIC Professionals       "" Economic Benefit of Breast-feeding Infants Enrolled in WIC. "" Debbie L. Montgomery and Patricia L. Splett.  Journal of the American Dietetic Association,  Apr 1997. v. 97 (4) p. 379-385.    NAL CALL NO:  389.8Am34    Abstract:  Objectives: To determine whether breast-feeding of infants enrolled in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) is associated with a reduction in Medicaid expenditures during the first six months o        f life; if so, to determine whether the reduction represents a positive economic benefit to society when WIC costs for these infants and their mothers are considered. Design: Cohorts of exclusively breast-fed and formula-fed infants were tracked for 6 mon        ths to compare WIC costs and Medicaid expenditures. Subjects: The sample consisted of 406 healthy infants who were breast-fed exclusively for at least 3 months and 470 healthy infants who were formula-fed exclusively. The infants, born between August 1, 1        993, and December 31, 1993, were enrolled in WIC and Medicaid. Cost and benefit measures: WIC costs included redeemed WIC vouchers for formula and foods for infants and mothers, plus administrative expenses for 6 months, minus manufacturers' rebates for f        ormula. Benefit was determined from Medicaid expenditures for health care initiated in the first 180 days of each infant's life. Statistical and benefit-cost analyses: Economic benefit was calculated as net benefit and as benefit-cost ratios. Regression t        echniques were used to estimate Medicaid expenditures associated with breast-feeding, adjusted for demographic and prenatal care variables. Results: Compared with formula-feeding, breast-feeding each infant enrolled in WIC saved $478 in WIC costs and Medi        caid expenditures during the first 6 months of the infant's life, or $161 after consideration of the formula manufacturer's rebate. A Medicaid cost saving of $112 per infant was realized by the breast-feeding cohort, and Medicaid pharmacy reimbursement co        sts for breast-fed infants were significantly lower--half that of formula-fed infants. Applications: The promotion of breast-feeding among low-income populations through nutrition programs such as WIC is an effective cost-containment measure.

NAL CALL NO:  389.8Am34    Abstract:   Objective: To determine the potential cost savings for four social service programs if breast-feeding rates increased among women in California. Design: Cost-savings analysis. Subjects/setting: Among women in California. In this populati        on, breast-feeding is currently uncommon, and use on contraceptives is minimal. Main outcome measures: Savings were based on estimates of the resulting decrease in infant morbidity, maternal fertility, and formula purchases (Special Supplemental Nutrition         Program for Women, Infants, and Children) if women breast-fed each child for at least 6 months. Costs were projected over a 7.5-year period and future values were discounted with annual interest rates of 2% or 4%. Results: Substantial savings estimates w        ere associated with breast-feeding for all four programs. The total projected savings over the 7.5-year period ranges from $3,442 to $4,944(4% discount) to $4,475 to $6,060 (0% discount) per family enrolled in all four programs. This translates into an es        timated yearly savings of between $459 and $659 (4% discount) and $597 and $808 (0% discount) per family. Applications: Although health care providers generally accept that breast-feeding is the preferred method for feeding infants, many still view the ch        oice as a neutral one that is, they consider low breast-feeding rates in the United States a cultural choice with no cost to society. This analysis provides evidence that breast-feeding is economically advantageous for individuals and society.

Journal of Nutrition Education, Mar/Apr 1995. v. 27 (2) p. 69-74.    NAL CALL NO:  TX341.J6     Abstract:    The very low rate of breastfeeding among Hmong immigrants to the U.S. is of concern to the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). The objective of this intervention was to increase breastfeeding initia        tion by specifically targeting attitudes towards infant feeding among Hmong WIC participants. The intervention group (n = 63) was compared with a control group (n = 349) of women who had delivered infants within the previous 8 months. The intervention con        sisted of a prenatal class and individual meeting, immediate support within 3 days postpartum, and a final interview 3 to 6 weeks postpartum. In the intervention group, 24 women (38.1%) initiated breastfeeding and 11 (17.5%) were still breastfeeding at th        e final interview, whereas in the control group, 19 women (5.4%) reported breastfeeding at their first postpartum WIC interview at 3 to 6 weeks postpartum (17.5% vs. 5.4%; p = .002). Older mothers were more likely to breastfeed. Primary reasons for choosi        ng formula included the availability of WIC vouchers and the perception that formula feeding was more convenient. Barriers to breastfeeding initiation included delayed first breastfeed (mean = 20 hours postpartum), separation of infant and mother, provisi        on of supplements in the hospital, and gifts of formula at discharge. This study illustrates that a short-term, targeted intervention can have a positive effect on the initiation of breastfeeding.     Target Audience:  WIC Professionals           C.

Jean Anliker. Journal of Nutrition Education,  Dec 1999. v. 31 (6) p. 347-354.    NAL CALL NO:   TX341.J6    Abstract:  Peer educators have been used for many years in nutrition education interventions. With the increasing importance of documented impacts, the role of peers is expanding to  include research activities. Twenty-seven peer educators were hired to deliver the Maryland WIC 5-A-Day Promotion Program in three pilot and 16 full-scale study WIC sites in Maryland. Their roles included recruiting and enrolling program participants, col        lecting pro- and postsurvey data and process evaluation forms, conducting a series of three 45-minute nutrition education sessions, providing social support, maintaining contact with participants through telephone and mail, and tracking participants throu        gh the course of the program. Peer educators can make valuable contributions to program design, deliver interventions effectively, and provide social support both to participants and to each other. However, peer educators need intensive training, support,         and monitoring for complete and accurate data collection, complete and consistent program delivery, and telephone contacts with participants. Because peer educators face life crises similar to those of their target audiences, special attention is often r        equired for them to remain effective. This paper presents strategies developed as part of the Maryland WIC 5 A Day Program for building the competencies of peer educators working in research.

Design: Baseline survey data were analyzed for women enrolled in the Maryland WIC 5 A Day Promotion Program, a study sponsored by the National Cancer Institute. Sociodemographic variables included age, race, education, marital         status, working status, pregnancy status, and smoking status. Psychosocial variables included self-efficacy, knowledge, attitudes, social support, and perceived barriers to consuming 5 or more servings daily of fruits and vegetables. Subjects/setting: Ana        lyses are based on 3,122 women enrolled at 15 WIC sites in Baltimore and 6 counties in Maryland. Statistical analyses performed: Because psychosocial characteristics were measured on different scales and varied in dispersion, we standardized scores for th        ese variables. Multiple regression analyses were then performed to assess contributions of the sociodemographic variables and the standardized psychosocial variable scores to the variance in consumption of fruits and vegetables. Results: Sociodemographic         variables were not powerful predictors of fruit and vegetable consumption. In contrast, an increase of 1 standard deviation in self-efficacy resulted in a mean increase of 0.76 servings, and an increase of 1 standard deviation in perceived barriers result        ed in a decrease of 0.50 servings. About 21% of the variance in consumption was explained by all of the variables examined. Applications: Dietitians and intervention programs should focus on increasing clients' self-efficacy, positive attitudes, and knowl        edge relating to fruits and vegetables while trying to reduce perceived barriers to consumption of fruits and vegetables.

Focus group discussions and central location intercept interviews were conducted with WIC participants to answer questions such as (1) What are their food shopping, preparation, and eating habits? (2) What perceptions do they have about fruits and ve        getables? (3) What barriers do they face to increased consumption of fruits and vegetables? and (4) What motivations and messages might be effective in promoting increased consumption? Results indicated that these women, while generally responsible for fo        od shopping and preparation did not cook extensively. They reported many positive perceptions of fruits and vegetables, but also identified barriers to increasing consumption, including lack of availability, time and effort to prepare, and preference for         other foods. Several implications for nutrition interventions were suggested. First, a key motivation for these women was being a good role model for their children suggesting a persuasive appeal to use in interventions. Second, review of the women's curr        ent eating behaviors led to an identification of five specific behaviors that had the most potential for increasing overall consumption. Finally, the findings suggested ways in which nutrition interventions could address each of the barriers identified. <        br>   Target Audience:  WIC Professionals           IV.

Objective: A population-based study was conducted to examine the association between early childhood anemia and mild or mod        erate metal retardation at 10 y of age. Design: The present study linked early childhood nutrition data collected by the Special Supplemental Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and school records. Hemoglobin values were used to determine the r        elation between anemia in early life and children's placement in special education classes for mild or moderate mental retardation. Subjects were all participants in the WIC program. A computer program was used to link data from birth, WIC, and school rec        ords. Results: Logistic regression showed an increased likelihood of mild or moderate mental retardation associated with anemia, independent of birth weight, maternal education, sex, race-ethnicity, the mother's age, or the child's age at entry into the W        IC program.

Abstract:  Objectives: To assess the prevalence of dental caries in a large group of preschool children, to determine the extent to which the children received dental treatment, to examine the association between demographic and socioeconomic factor        s and the prevalence of caries, and to compare these findings with those from previous studies of preschool populations in the United States. Methods: Dental caries exams were performed on 5171 children ages 5 months through 4 years, and a parent or other         caregiver was asked to complete a questionnaire giving information about the child and her or his household. The children were recruited from Head Start programs; Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) nutrition programs; health fairs; and day care centers i        n a representative sample of Arizona communities with populations of more than 1000 people. Results: Of the 994 one-year-old children examined, 6.4% had caries, with a mean dmft (decayed, missing [extracted due to caries], and filled teeth) score of 0.18.         Nearly 20% of the 2-year-olds had caries, with a mean dmft of 0.70. Thirty-five percent of the 3-year-olds had caries, with a mean dmft of 1.35, and 49% of the 4-year-olds had caries, with a mean dmft of 2.36. Children whose caregivers fell into the lowe        st education category had a mean dmft score three times higher than those with caregivers in the highest education category. Children with caregivers in the lowest income category had a mean dmft score four times higher than those with caregivers in the h        ighest category. Children younger than age 3 had little evidence of dental treatment, and most of the children with caries in each age group had no filled or extracted teeth.    Conclusions: The data show that dental caries is highly prevalent in this preschool population, with little of the disease being treated. Timing of diagnostic examinations and prevention strategies for preschool children need to be reconsidered, especiall        y for children identified as having a high risk of caries.

NAL CALL NO:  389.8 Am34    Abstract:   To assess two groups' knowledge of the role of diet in the etiology of dental caries: nutritionists in the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and public health dental hygienists. Design A self-admini        stered survey contained questions about the cause of dental canes, the importance of caries preventive measures, dietary factors linked to dental caries, dietary advice for patients with active dental caries, and diet related topics discussed with clients        . Surveys were sent to all WIC nutritionists and public health dental hygienists in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. Of the 235 surveys mailed, 188 completed surveys composed the final sample. Descriptive tests, means and frequencies, and the chi squared te        st were used to measure differences in nutritionists' and hygienists' responses. One half of the nutritionists and three fourths of the hygienists recognized that dental caries was caused by a bacterial infection. Most dental researchers consider fluoride         exposure and dental sealants to be highly effective caries preventive measures; in contrast, WIC nutritionists and dental hygienists identified oral hygiene as being most important in preventing canes. Frequency of snacking and retentiveness of food in t        he mouth were accurately rated important dietary factors in the development of dental caries by both groups. However, limiting intake of fermentable carbohydrates between meals was not considered the most important dietary advice for clients. Applications        : Results suggest that current research about the role of diet in the prevention of dental caries should be included in both nutrition and dental hygiene curriculums and continuing education courses for these professionals.

NAL CAL NO: TX341.J6    Abstract:  The Families in Transition program (FIT), in collaboration with the University of Maryland School of Medicine, designed and implemented a Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) homeless outreach proje        ct. Staff scheduled regular outreach visits to shelters and soup kitchens to ensure that eligible participants were certified for the WIC program and families were closely followed. Two hundred fourteen homeless clients were certified for the WIC program         during a 1-year period. A nutritional analysis of foods provided by shelters and soup kitchens revealed that participants' daily dietary intakes would be deficient in key nutrients for pregnant and breastfeeding women and children under age 5. This analys        is was based on the assumptions that participants at any given shelter or soup kitchen had access to no food other than that provided by the shelter or kitchen and that participants consumed all foods available at the shelter or soup kitchen. Providing in        tensive nutrition and health education played a key role in ensuring proper use of the WIC food packages. Outreach services are fundamental to effectively serving homeless families through the WIC program.     Target Audience:  WIC Professionals           E.

Design: Longitudinal follow-up of women and their infants who participated in a WIC-based breast-feeding promotion project. Women enrolled prenatally at or before 24 weeks of gestation were followed up until 16 weeks postpartum. Subjects/setting: Two hund        red seventeen African-American WIC participants in an urban area. Methods: Data related to infant feeding practices were collected by interviewers who used a structured questionnaire to determine when nonmilk liquids or solids were introduced to the infan        t. Reported practices were compared with current recommendations. Statistical analysis performed: Contingency table analysis, including x(2) tests, and multivariate analysis using logistic regression. Results: By 7 to 10 days postpartum, approximately a t        hird of infants were receiving some nonmilk liquids or solids; this escalated to 77% by 8 weeks and 93% by 16 weeks postpartum. Women breast-feeding exclusively (ie, not adding nonmilk liquids or solids) were least likely, and women providing mixed feedin        g (breast milk and formula) were more likely, than women feeding formula exclusively to introduce nonmilk liquids and solids at each data collection time period. Applications/conclusions: WIC participants who receive instruction about infant feeding nutri        tion are no more likely than mothers who do not participate in WIC to follow infant feeding guidelines recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics in regard to the time when solids should be introduced to  infants' diet. Our findings suggest the nee        d for WIC to implement more powerful and innovative educational and motivational strategies to help mothers delay the introduction of nonmilk liquids and solid foods until their infants are 4 to 6 months old, as recommended.

"" Kyungwon Park and John R. Ureda. Journal of Nutrition Education, Mar/Apr 1999. v. 31 (2) p. 76-85.   NAL CAL NO: TX341.J6    Abstract:   To identify motivational determinants of milk consumption, a major source of prenatal calcium intake, 180 pregnant women drawn from two prenatal clinics in South Carolina were surveyed. Most of them were enrolled in or eligible for the S        pecial Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC Program). The Theory of Planned Behavior was used to design an instrument assessing attitudinal, subjective normative, and perceived control beliefs toward consuming milk. Motivati        onal beliefs explaining milk consumption were first explored using univariate regression (p < .05), and a set of salient beliefs was identified using multiple regression with backward elimination (p < .1). Multiple regression models based upon these         factors explained more than 49% of the variability in motivation for milk consumption (p = .0001). Practical reasons for consuming milk including ""taste"" and ""quench thirst"" and perceived health consequences were among attitudinal beliefs included in the         models. ""Husband/boyfriend,"" ""doctor,"" and ""nurse/WIC/ staff/nutritionist"" were identified as social influences, and perceived confidence in ""keeping milk fresh,"" ""keeping milk at home for me,"" ""buying/getting milk whenever I wanted to,"" and ""being able         to drink two cups a day"" were among perceived control beliefs contributing to the models. These beliefs provide a basis for targeted prenatal educational interventions, which should include strategies addressing all three factors described in the Planned         Behavior model.

NAL CAL NO: 389.8 Am34    Abstract:  Objective: To determine the prevalence of pica during pregnancy, maternal hemoglobin levels at delivery, and the association of pica with 2 adverse pregnancy outcomes: low birth weight and preterm birth. Design: A retrospective cohort stu        dy was conducted using eligible subjects (n=281) from a cross-sectional survey (n=366). Subjects/setting: Mothers aged 16 to 30 years with infants younger than 1 year of age who participated in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants        , and Children (WIC) were interviewed at 4 WIC clinics in Houston and Prairie View, Tex. Medical records from 31 hospitals were abstracted. Main Outcome Measures: Maternal hemoglobin levels at delivery, mean birth weight, and mean gestational age were com        pared for women who reported pica and women who did not. Statistical analyses: chi2 Tests, orthogonal t tests, analysis of variance, and regression analysis were used to test the relationships among study variables. Results: Pica prevalence categorized by         substance was as follows: ice, 53.7%; ice and freezer frost, 14.6%; other substances such as baking soda, baking powder, cornstarch, laundry starch, baby powder, clay, or dirt, 8.2%; and no pica, 23.5%. Women in all 3 pica groups had lower hemoglobin lev        els (mean +/- standard deviation, 114 +/- 12 g/L, 110 +/- 13 g/L, and 113 +/- 12 g/L, respectively) at delivery than women who did not report pica (118 +/- 11 g/L) (P<.01 for all pica groups vs no pica). There were no differences in mean birth weight o        r mean gestational age of infants born to women from the 3 pica groups and the No Pica group. Applications: The findings suggest that pica practices are associated with significantly lower maternal hemoglobin levels at delivery but are not associated with         pregnancy outcomes. Dietitians should ask pregnant women with anemia about pica and should counsel women who report pica regarding the health risks associated with it.

This study was conducted to determine the nutritional status and nutrient intake of low-income pregnant women enrolle        d in the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). The 24-hour recall method, food frequency list, and nutrient analysis were used to determine the dietary intakes of 23 nutrients for 142 pregnant women aged 15 to 37 years.         The results indicate that the recommended allowances for some key essential nutrients such as iron, folacin, zinc, and calcium were not being met through the diet during the gestational period. Nutrition educators, therefore, must emphasize the inclusion         of these nutrients in the diets of this target population.

NAL CALL NO:  TX341.J6    Abstract:  We conducted an evaluation of an interactive, multimedia nutrition education computer application. Changes in knowledge, attitude, and behavioral intentions were measured by pre- and postviewing surveys among a high-risk, low-income popul        ation receiving services from Maine's Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC). In addition, client acceptance of the application and the impact of the system on WIC clinics were explored through interviews and focus gr        oups. Responses to 44 of 66 survey questions improved from pre to postviewings. Client acceptance of kiosk use was favorable. Ninety-three percent of interviewed clients reported positive feelings about using the multimedia system to learn. Although many         nutritionists and aides reported that using this technology has a positive impact, some lack of staff acceptance appeared to limit its use. Guidance for future development of multimedia interactive software is offered.

Summary: To identify recent studies that examine the effectiveness of each WIC nutrition service, we searched relevant databases, such as the National Technical Information Service, Sociological Abstracts, and Wilson Social Science Abstracts. We also cons        ulted with USDA WIC program staff and other program stakeholders including officials from the National Association of WIC Directors. Initially, we identified more than 200 published WIC studies dealing with various aspects of the WIC program. In order to         focus on recent research, we eliminated from consideration research published prior to 1995. We also eliminated any study that did not specifically address the effects of at least one of the three WIC nutrition services, whether nutrition education, breas        tfeeding promotion and support, or referral services. We included research that falls in two general categories: demonstration studies and impact studies. The demonstration studies typically attempt to assess whether special interventions, such as hospita        l visits to promote breastfeeding, more effectively achieve program objectives than the usual WIC services. In contrast, impact studies attempt to determine whether a WIC nutrition service, such as breastfeeding promotion and support, improves WIC partici        pants' outcomes compared to similar individuals who do not participate in the WIC program.

NAL CALL NO:  aTX326.A1U5    Web Site (full text):   http://www.usda.gov/cnpp/FENR.htm    Abstract:  We examine the contribution of the Food Stamp Program (FSP) and the Special Supplemental Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) to the nutrition security and diet quality of low-income participating households. This information ca        n improve future monitoring of the effects of welfare policy reforms. Welfare reform has emphasized moving people from welfare to work modifying or eliminating many former entitlement programs. However, after debate, Federal food assistance programs were         retained as a nutritional safety net, although in some cases access and benefits were restricted. Using historical consumption data (CSFII 1989-91), we examine the hypothesis that participation in the FSP and/or WIC is an important factor in maintaining a        nd improving the diet quality of low-income households. Using USDA's Healthy Eating Index (HEI), as an indicator of overall diet quality, and its 10 component indices, we estimate for the first time overall diet quality effects of changes in FSP and WIC p        articipation and benefit levels. (The HEI permits us to examine diet quality as nutritionists see   some foods consumed  too little and others too much.) Results suggest that both programs contribute significantly to maintaining and improving the nutrit        ional well-being of low-income households, considering both quantity and quality of diet components. We believe the implication is that these food assistance programs help low-income households achieve nutrition security-including improved diet quality-an        d that their support provides a critical safety net to accompany welfare reform.

The program had approximat        ely 344,000 participants in l975 and has grown to provide services to nearly 6 million participants. Infants born to women who participate in WIC during pregnancy tend to have a slightly higher mean birth weight than those born to women who were eligible         but did not participate in WIC. Higher birth weight has been associated with a slightly higher mean gestational age. The prevalence of low birth weight and very low birth weight among infants and the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia among toddlers and         preschool children is lower for those participating in WIC than for those not participating in WIC.

Journal of the American Dietetic Association, Dec 1999. v. 99,  p. 1549-1553.    NAL CALL NO:  389.8 Am34    Abstract:  Objective: To assess consumption of foods from food packages provided by the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIG) among 80 Chinese prenatal WIG recipients living in Oakland or San  Francisco, Calif. Design: During a single interview, a food frequency questionnaire was used to assess WIG food consumption by the prenatal patients for the period before and after receipt of WIC vouchers. Setting: The study was conducted at Asian Health         Services, Oakland, and the Chinatown Public Health Center of the San Francisco Department of Public Health in California.   Subjects: Eighty low-income Chinese prenatal women with limited education and limited ability to speak English, aged 121 to 43 years, with gestational stages of 15 to 38 weeks.   Statistical Analyses Performed: Descriptive statistics (frequency and percent distribution) were used to report the findings of the study. Results: Subjects reported that before receiving WIC vouchers, milk, eggs, and juice were the only foods in their WI        C food package that had been consumed frequently (>5 times/week~ in their daily diet Other WIC foods, including cheese, peanut butter, dried beans, and hot and cold cereals, were consumed infrequently (0 to I time/month). Subjects reported that with the a        vailability of WIC vouchers, milk, eggs, and juice remained frequently consumed with 81% to 100% of monthly supply as the most prevalent reported consumption rate. Dried beans and hot and cold cereals were also consumed frequently. Cheese remained poorly         consumed (0% to 20% of the monthly supply). As many as 74 of 80 subjects stated that they had shared foods from their own WIC package, except milk, with their families. The use of any WIC foods provided to other children in the family was not assessed in         this study. Applications: Data from this study indicate that most WIC foods were well used by Chinese prenatal patients. The most notable exception was cheese, which was poorly consumed.       The ready consumption of milk by pregnant Chinese WIC recipients in this study suggests that milk may be readily consumed by these women, even though it is atypical of the Asian diet. The WIC food package for Chinese prenatal patients may be improved by o        mitting cheese and substituting more milk and/or foods such as tofu and dark green leafy vegetables.

In addition, 574,800 Michigan adults aged 4074 have prediabetes or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). In 2000, diabetes was the sixth leading cause of death for Michigan residents. Diabetes-related medical care in Michigan exceeded $2.9 billion, with 60% of these costs attributed to hospitalization.  Evidence That Prevention Works Multiple national and international studies have established the effectiveness of diabetes care improvement and patient self-management in reducing and delaying the onset of blindness, the need for foot or lower-extremity amputations, kidney disease, and many other diabetes outcomes. Recent diabetes prevention clinical trials have clearly demonstrated that among those with prediabetes, diabetes onset can be prevented or significantly delayed through modest improvements in nutrition, weight control, and exercise levels.  Program Example The Michigan Diabetes Outreach Network (MDON) is composed of six regional Diabetes Outreach Networks. As part of this program, the networks have a Diabetes Care Improvement Project and work with over 150 agencies in the state. The agencies include physician offices, community health centers, home care agencies, state certified diabetes self-management education programs, and a range of other health care providers. The networks collaborate with the agencies to ensure that people with diabetes receive care according to current American Diabetes Association (ADA) clinical practice recommendations. Data are collected during the initial patient visit and follow-up appointments to determine how to improve care. The data through 2001 for A1C monitoring, foot exams, and microalbuminuria (kidney disease) assessments (all done at least once annually) show a significant improvement in the number of people with diabetes who have these tests done. In 2001, A1C tests increased from 14% in 1996 to 78%, and foot exams increased from 58% in 1996 to 77%. Microalbuminuria tests were added to the data system in 2000 and increased from 22% to 28% in the number of people tested between 2000 and 2001. MDON clients also reported significantly improved physical activity levels and nutritional planning.  Implications Results from MDON demonstrate that working with health care agencies and providers through a statewide Diabetes Care Improvement Project can improve outcomes for people with diabetes. This program demonstrates that a regional network can play an effective role in helping to assure that all care provided to clients is based on ADA clinical practice recommendations. 37  Contact Information Michigan Department of Community Health  Division of Chronic Disease and Injury Control  3423 N.

Evidence That Prevention Works Studies demonstrate that intensive preventive care, controlling blood glucose levels, improved nutrition, and increased drug therapy compliance significantly reduce adverse diabetes outcomes such as premature death, blindness, kidney failure, or lower-extremity amputations.  Program Example Using CDC funding, the Minnesota Diabetes Prevention and Control Program partnered with two community-based coalitions in rural counties to develop and test a public-private collaboration called the Diabetes Community Collaboration Program (DCCP). The DCCP brought together potentially competing groups of diabetes stakeholders, including local public health agencies, private health care organizations, and community groups, to identify and address common goals for diabetes care and education. The coalitions planned, implemented, and evaluated a broad range of activities in their communities for people with diabetes, the general public, health care systems, and health care providers. One coalition developed a community diabetes registry that is used for monitoring diabetes care, providing ongoing diabetes education, and reminding registrants to obtain needed health care services. Both coalitions have expanded educational opportunities for people with diabetes by providing ongoing diabetes education through local media, community events, formal education, and support groups. Each coalition has created opportunities for health care providers to receive updates about the standards of diabetes care through professional education workshops. The coalitions' efforts resulted in diabetes care improvements in the local clinics between 1995 and 2000. Clinic patient chart audit data showed that A1C testing increased by 82% in Rice County and by 300% in northern Koochiching County. Kidney function testing rose by 80% and 400%, respectively; median A1C levels decreased by 9.4% and 17%, respectively. Lipid levels also shifted from higher to lower risk categories.  Implications The DCCP diabetes coalitions created community networks, improved diabetes care, increased education among diabetes patients to empower them to advocate for their own care, and improved diabetes education among health care professionals and providers. This program is an example of how the Diabetes Today community model can be implemented within a local health care system to increase coordination, collaboration, and resource sharing to reduce the burden of diabetes. 38  Contact Information Minnesota Department of Health  Minnesota Diabetes Program  P.O.

In 2001, an estimated 6.5% of adult Missourians (about 276,453 persons) reported physician-diagnosed diabetes.  Evidence That Prevention Works Studies have shown that by providing better access to preventive care, diabetes-related outcomes such as blindness, kidney failure, and lower-extremity amputation can be prevented or delayed.  Program Example The Missouri Diabetes Prevention and Control Program (MDPCP) collaborated with six federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) and one National Health Service site that participated in the Bureau of Primary Health Care's National Health Disparities Diabetes Collaborative. From June 2000 to June 2002, each center implemented the Chronic Care Model in one or more clinics, forming teams of diabetes-related health care specialists. Each center established an initial ""population of focus,"" a registry of patients with diabetes. Additional provider or site registries were added as the project period progressed. The Diabetes Electronic Measurement System (DEMS) was used to monitor indicators of health status, health behaviors, and services received. The MDPCP's second-year evaluation of aggregate data from the combined diabetes registries of the seven Missouri health centers participating in the Diabetes Collaborative found that the number of patients enrolled in the Diabetes Collaborative increased from 1,107 to 3,431, or by 210%. In the aggregate registries, there were significant improvements in the prevalence of 10 key measures: (1) average A1C value (-3%), (2) retinal eye exam (+197%), (3) dental exam or referral (+325%), (4) foot exam (+18%), (5) influenza vaccination or referral (+149%), (6) choleterol testing (+37%), (7) body mass index calculation (+15%), (8) diabetes education (+78%), (9) self-management goal setting (+24%), and (10) nutrition counseling (+92%).  Implications In Missouri, the health centers' participation in the Midwest Cluster of the National Diabetes Collaborative made and sustained substantial improvements in the quality of care for their patients with diabetes. Future efforts should focus on maintaining and improving these gains while extending their benefits to other Missourians with diabetes. This program demonstrates the importance of team delivery of comprehensive health care and increasing patients' participation in the management of their diabetes.  39  Contact Information Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services  Missouri Diabetes Control Program  920 Wildwood Drive  P.O.

Indian Health Service, urban, and tribal diabetes programs face many challenges in providing quality care to their diabetes patients as well as in implementing diabetes prevention activities because of the large number of American Indians with diagnosed diabetes and the geographic remoteness of the reservations in Montana.  Evidence That Prevention Works Recent primary delay the onset from secondary development of prevention studies have demonstrated that weight loss and regular physical activity can of diabetes among people at high risk of developing the disease. Similarly, the results prevention trials indicate that intensive management of diabetes can prevent the serious diabetes-related complications.  Program Example Beginning in 1997, the Montana Diabetes Prevention and Control Program (DPCP), the Billings Area Indian Health Service (IHS) diabetes program, the urban Indian program, and each of the tribal and IHS diabetes programs developed an effective collaborative partnership to identify and reduce the burden of diabetes among American Indians in Montana. Specifically, this partnership has addressed communitybased health systems, health communications strategies, and surveillance, including establishing a surveillance system to monitor trends in diabetes prevalence and the quality of care among American Indian youth. Through this partnership, epidemiologic support was provided to assist diabetes coordinators in summarizing information from their ongoing school screening programs to assess diabetes risk among youth and assess trends in preventive services and clinical outcomes. A software system also was developed to support a community-based project between the University of Montana and the Salish and Kootenai tribes to improve physical activity and nutrition among American Indians at risk for diabetes.  Implications These unique collaborative efforts combine the resources, expertise, and ""people-power"" of the tribal and IHS diabetes programs and the state DPCP to reduce the burden of diabetes in Montana. The surveillance, community-based health systems, and health communications strategies will enable the tribal and IHS diabetes programs to monitor trends in diabetes among their young people, evaluate the effectiveness of their diabetes prevention activities, and identify opportunities to improve care for their patients with diabetes.  40  Contact Information Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services  Cogswell Building, C-317  P.O.

An estimated 584,000 people have diabetes in North Carolina, and one third of these people probably do not know they have the disease. From 1995 to 2000, the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes in the adult population increased by 42% (from 4.5% to 6.4%); this percentage translates to about 389,000 people with diagnosed diabetes in North Carolina.  Evidence That Prevention Works Research, such as the National Institutes of Health's Diabetes Control and Complications Trial, confirms that people with diabetes can drastically reduce their risk for serious complications by controlling their blood glucose levels and following recommended screening guidelines so complications can be detected early. Up to 90% of diabetes-related blindness and over 50% of diabetes-related lower-extremity amputations and kidney failures are preventable.  Program Example A CDC-sponsored program, Project DIRECT (Diabetes Interventions Reaching and Educating Communities Together), focuses on the African American community in Southeast Raleigh. Project DIRECT offers a comprehensive approach to prevention and works to reduce the risk factors for diabetes (by promoting increased physical activity and improved dietary practices) and to increase overall awareness of diabetes and its risk factors and complications. Project DIRECT also works to increase the number of people at high risk who are screened for diabetes and to increase the number of people with diagnosed diabetes who receive regular diabetes care. In its first year, Project DIRECT increased the number of diabetes patients who received foot care counseling and foot exams from approximately 20% to 50%. Patient chart audits also have shown increased numbers of people with diabetes who monitor their blood glucose levels at home; participate in diabetes education; monitor their A1C levels; and get ophthalmology referrals, microalbuminuria (kidney disease) assessments, and vascular exams.  Implications Project DIRECT demonstrates that significant changes in the preventive care practices of health care providers can lead to overall improvements in care and can reduce the devastating complications of diabetes. Diabetes self-management education can provide special populations, such as the African American community that was reached through Project DIRECT, with some of the necessary tools to manage their diabetes more effectively.  41  Contact Information North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services Mailservice 1915  Raleigh, North Carolina 27699-1915 Phone: (919) 725-3131  Web site: www.ncdiabetes.org   Diabetes Basic Implementation  Utah Working With Health Care Providers to Implement Care Management Strategies to Ensure Appropriate Diabetes Testing Public Health Problem Utah residents with diabetes are not receiving health care services recommended by the American Diabetes Association (ADA), such as AlC tests and eye exams. Data collected from health plans in Utah showed that although 77% of the commercial health plan members with diabetes had received at least one A1C test in the preceding year, only 23% had levels below 7%, and only 42% had levels below 8%. In the Medicaid health plans, the percentages were 78% tested, 26% below 7%, and 44% below 8%.  Evidence That Prevention Works Results from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial and the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study have shown that maintaining near normal blood glucose levels (at or below 7%) could significantly reduce diabetes complications. Other studies have shown that regular eye exams and tests for kidney function can prevent or delay diabetic eye disease and kidney failure.  Program Example To help meet the recommended standards of care for people with diabetes, the CDC-funded Utah Diabetes Prevention and Control Program convened a group of nine health plans to develop, implement, and evaluate care management strategies. The health plans matched members with diabetes to their most likely primary care provider and determined whether the members had received the recommended screening tests by using HEDIS measurements. Members received a personal profile of their screening test history and information on the recommended tests and their frequency, their health plan's policy for reimbursement for each test, and an incentive for getting an eye exam (e.g., a 60-minute telephone calling card). After the program was implemented in March 2000, participating health plans collected HEDIS data on diabetes-related screening tests from 3,000 patient charts to evaluate the intervention. The results, although not exclusively attributed to the intervention, were significant. A1C testing for commercial and Medicaid plan members increased 12.5% to 86% and 1.5% to 79%, respectively. Commercial plans increased the percentage of patients with A1C levels below 7% to 33% (a 40% increase); the percentage below 8% increased to 53% (a 25% increase). For the Medicaid plans, there were also improvements in A1C levels among patients (by 19% for those below 7% and by 18% for those below 8%). The percentage of documented eye exams improved for both commercial (by 18% to a level of 47%) and Medicaid (by 5% to a level of 48%) plans.  Implications This program demonstrates that testing to detect eye and kidney disease early and monitoring A1C levels can be increased substantially by direct health plan involvement. Preventing severe vision loss and halting the progression of kidney disease alone could significantly improve the quality of life of many people with diabetes and save millions of dollars in medical costs. 42  Contact Information Utah Department of Health  Division of Community and Family Health Services 288 North 1460 West  P.O.

In 1999, diabetes was associated with 56,485 hospitalizations in Washington at a cost of $671 million. Many of these hospitalizations could have been prevented through early detection and appropriate diabetes management, including blood sugar control.  Evidence That Prevention Works Prevention of elevated blood sugar can dramatically prevent other health problems for people with diabetes and potentially reduce health care costs. A systematic and collaborative approach to shift the medical care delivery system to a chronic care focus can improve blood sugar levels and other diabetes indicators in patients who participate in primary care organizations.  Program Example The Washington State Department of Health Diabetes Prevention and Control Program and Qualis Health (a Medicare Quality Improvement Organization) sponsored the Washington State Diabetes Collaboratives (WSDC) I and II.WSDC I and II are quality improvement projects for primary care practices to improve health outcomes for people with diabetes. Seventeen practice teams and 10 health plans participated in WSDC I, and 30 practice teams and 7 health plans participated in WSDC II. Teams established a registry to track their patients with diabetes and test and implement changes in their practice using the Chronic Care Model as a framework. The Washington State Diabetes Prevention and Control Program developed the Diabetes Electronic Management System (DEMS) and provided this tracking system and technical assistance to participating clinics free of charge. After a 13-month intensive phase, the Diabetes Prevention and Control Program and Qualis Health continue to provide services and encouragement to support the clinical practice teams continuing their work. Some of these services include maintaining an active E-mail list for team members to consult their peers, providing aggregate quarterly reporting to give teams a statewide benchmark, providing ongoing DEMS registry support, and training new staff. Among 981 patients, blood sugar levels decreased on average by approximately 10%, and the prevalence of patients who had extremely high blood sugar levels decreased from 24% to 17%.  Implications The Washington State Diabetes Collaboratives are producing results and demonstrate that this state Diabetes Prevention and Control Program can play a critical role in improving diabetes care.  43  Contact Information Washington Department of Health  Diabetes Prevention and Control Program 7211 Cleanwater Lane, Building 13  P.O.

This estimate includes both diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes. In 2000, there were 78,790 diabetes-related hospitalizations in Wisconsin, costing more than $1.03 billion.  Evidence That Prevention Works National and international studies have shown that improved diabetes care and patient self-management can delay blindness, lower-extremity amputations, kidney disease, and other adverse outcomes in people with diabetes. Recent diabetes prevention clinical trials clearly have demonstrated that, among those with prediabetes, the onset of diabetes can be prevented or delayed significantly through modest improvements in nutrition, weight control, and exercise levels.  Program Example In 1998, the Wisconsin Diabetes Advisory Group (DAG) developed and published Essential Diabetes Mellitus Care Guidelines as a way of improving diabetes care through health care providers and health systems. Over 70% of Wisconsin's licensed health maintenance organizations (HMOs) adopted or adapted these guidelines. The Wisconsin Diabetes Prevention and Control Program, in partnership with the University of Wisconsin Department of Population Health Sciences, members of DAG, and state HMOs developed the Wisconsin Collaborative Diabetes Quality Improvement Project. Broadly, the Collaborative Project's strategic goals include evaluating the implementation of the Essential Diabetes Mellitus Care Guidelines; sharing resources, population-based strategies, and best practices among collaborators; and improving diabetes care through collaborative quality improvement initiatives. Aggregate data from the project's third-year evaluation show that the Wisconsin collaborators performed at a level that exceeded the National Committee on Quality Assurance (NCQA) regional and national averages on each of the six diabetes measures (A1C monitoring, A1C control, LDL-cholesterol screening, LDL-cholesterol control, eye exams, and kidney disease screening). Additionally, the majority of Wisconsin's HMOs currently participate in the project. The collaborators also initiated a statewide quality improvement intervention to increase eye exams and improve reporting of exam results and recommendations.  Implications This program demonstrates the importance of promoting collaboration to share best practices and effective strategies that lead to quality interventions to improve diabetes prevention and control measures.  44  Contact Information Wisconsin Department of Health and Family Services  Division of Public Health 1 W.

Written to help caregivers, parents, and the children themselves, the booklet addresses the eruption of primary or baby teeth and permanent teeth, dental emergencies, and preventive measures including good nutrition and the use of fluoride and sealants.

This illustrated booklet, written in nontechnical language, uses a question and answer format to provide people who have diabetes with information on preventing tooth and gum problems caused by diabetes. High blood sugar helps bacteria grow, which can lead to a condition called periodontitis. Symptoms of tooth and gum damage include red, sore, swollen gums; bleeding gums; gums pulling away from teeth; loose or sensitive teeth; bad breath; a bite that feels different; and poor fitting dentures. The booklet explains how a person and his or her dentist can keep teeth and gums healthy. The booklet also provides general tips for staying healthy. In addition, the booklet includes sources of information about diabetes and describes the activities of the National Diabetes Information Clearinghouse. This article addresses the issue of oral health for people who have diabetes. People who have diabetes face special challenges for keeping their teeth and gums healthy. Research has shown a relationship between healthy gums and teeth, blood glucose levels in the normal range, and overall good health in people who have diabetes. Few people know much about the connection between periodontal health and diabetes. Periodontal diseases are infections in the mouth that affect the soft gum tissue and the supporting bone. A high blood glucose level increases the risk for periodontal disease because it makes a person susceptible to infections, inhibits the healing of infections, promotes the growth of bacteria that feed on sugar, and reduces blood supply to the oral tissues. The article includes sources of additional information about dental products and good oral health. 1 figure.

This brief newsletter reminds readers of the oral health problems associated with smoking. The author comments on the newly chic messages from the tobacco industry, particularly on the phenomenal rise in cigar popularity. The author notes that people are appeased by the argument that cigar smoke isn't inhaled but held in the mouth. However, the risks of lung, larynx, and oral cancer are still increased greatly by cigar smoking. The author concludes by outlining what readers can expect when they quit smoking, overcoming both the physical addiction and the social habit. The author encourages readers to quit smoking, even if failing the first time or several times.

Many immigrants, including the Hmong, are unaware of the importance of dental care. As early as infancy, many Hmong develop poor dental health. Culture-specific education is the key. To help teach the Hmong about healthy teeth and gums, the University of Minnesota has developed two new educational videotapes: Your baby's teeth are important! Preventing baby-bottle tooth decay in Hmong children and Keeping your teeth for life: Dental care for Hmong in America. These tapes can greatly assist health and dental care providers in their treatment of Hmong adults and children. Each tape is about 10 minutes long. The tapes are narrated in Hmong and show Hmong people as examples. Target  Stop Guide: The Smokeless Tobacco Outreach And Prevention Guide.

The brochure briefly discusses six common causes of bad breath, including bacteria and food particles, gum disease, dry mouth (xerostomia), certain foods, tobacco use, and other causes, including certain diseases. The brochure then explains how the dental care provider can help find a cause for bad breath and help the patient treat the problem,.The patient may be referred to another dental or medical specialist for evaluation and treatment. The brochure then lists and briefly describes strategies that readers can employ to help avoid bad breath: brush the tongue, keep a moist mouth, make dietary changes, stop smoking or chewing tobacco, and ask the dentist about prescription mouth rinses. The brochure is illustrated with simple line drawings. 13 figures. This brochure from the American Dental Association guides readers in strategies to fight bad breath (halitosis). The brochure reminds readers that dentists can help identify the cause of bad breath and, if it is due to an oral condition, develop a treatment plan to help eliminate it. Food that collects between teeth, around the gums, and on the tongue can leave an unpleasant odor, or attract bacteria that cause bad breath. Therefore, adequate toothbrushing and flossing can prevent bad breath. The brochure also discusses the role of certain foods, the problem of bad breath in people who are dieting, bad breath as a warning sign of periodontal (gum) disease, dry mouth (xerostomia) and related bad breath, the use of tobacco products, and systemic disease or medical disorders that can contribute to bad breath. The back cover of the brochure offers five tips for preventing bad breath. In 1997, Americans spent over $54 billion on soft drinks. The industry produced 14 billion gallons of soft drinks, twice as much as in 1974. Soda pop is America's single biggest source of refined sugars, providing the average person with 1/3 of that sugar. Boys and girls consume twice as much soda pop as milk. Obesity rates have risen in tandem with soda consumption. This pamphlet explains what dental sealants are, why to get them, what causes tooth decay, why back teeth decay so easily, who should get sealants, should sealants be put on baby teeth, how much sealants costs, does insurance pay for them, how long do they last, what if a small cavity is covered by a sealant, are sealants new, how sealants are put on, and other ways to prevent tooth decay. The importance of fluoride is also presented. This illustrated brochure shows the proper methods for brushing and flossing teeth.

The data for 1999 are placed in a temporal context by comparison with the data for the preceding 10 years.  Data on the number and characteristics of firearm-related fatalities among Arizona residents were obtained from the death certificates filed with the Arizona Department of Health Services. Population denominators for Arizona residents, used to calculate rates, are projections from the Population Statistics Unit in the Arizona Department of Economic Security (DES; data for 1989 and 1993 to 1999) and the U.S. Census Bureau (data for 1990 and data by ethnic group for 1999). Detailed population data by gender, age and county were unavailable for 1991 to 1992. In order to obtain the population denominators for these two years, the 1990 percentages of population breakdowns (or census shares) by age group and gender were applied to 1991 and 1992 total state or county population estimates published by the DES.  M  ETHODS AND  SOU  RCES  In this report, firearm-related fatalities are defined according to the ICD-9* as an underlying cause of death coded as: E922.0 - E922.9 (unintentional or accidental injury caused by firearms), E955.0 - E955.4 (suicide by firearms), E965.0 - E965.4 (homicide by firearms), E970 (fatal injury due to legal intervention by firearms) and E985.0 - E985.4 (firearm-related fatalities which are undetermined whether they were purposely or accidentally inflicted). _____________________________ * International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries and Causes of Death, ICD-9 Ninth Revision.

It is not intended to be an exhaustive analysis of the tabulated data. When possible, United States data are given in order to provide a comparative context for the Arizona firearm-related mortality statistics.   F  IREARM  -R  ELATED  F  ATALITIES,  2  A  RIZONA,  1989-1999  Firearms rank second, surpassed only by motor vehicles, as the leading cause of injury mortality both nationwide and in Arizona. Firearm-related injuries and motor vehicle collisions accounted for more than 5 out of every 10 (53 percent) injury deaths in Arizona in 1999. Relative to Arizonans were from firearm in from 1989 to Table 1). people nationally, more likely to die juries in each year 1999 (Figure 1, firearm-related in Arizona by 933 in 1998 to 2).  were classified as unintentionally inflicted firearm injuries, 495 (59.4 percent) as suicides, 303 (36.4 percent) as homicides, 21 (2.5 percent) were fatal injuries inflicted by the police or other lawenforcement agents, and 7 (0.8 percent) were undetermined whether the injury was accidentally or purposely inflicted (Figure 2). The firearm-related death rate among Blacks (29.0/100,000) was the highest among ethnic groups in Arizona in 1999. It exceeded the corresponding rates for Asian, American Indian, White nonHispanic, and Hispanic residents of Arizona by 339, 120, 97 and 26 percent respectively (Figure 3). Among White non-Hispanics, firearm-related fatalities predominantly were a result of suicide (79.7 percent, Figure 4). In contrast, the majority of deaths from firearms were incurred in acts of homicide among Blacks (76.5 percent) and Hispanics (63.7 percent). Among American Indians, firearm-related fatalities were more likely to be incurred in acts of homicide (48.6 percent) than suicide (40 percent). Firearm-related fatalities among ethnic minorities occurred at younger ages compared to firearmrelated deaths among White nonHispanics. Eight out of ten (83.5 percent) of 1999 firearm-related deaths for all ethnic minority groups combined were less than 45 years old, while only 46 percent of firearm-related deaths among white non-Hispanics were this young (percentages based on data in Table 6).  The number of fatalities decreased 10.7 percent, from 833 in 1999 (Table  The Arizona age-adjusted firearm-related mortality rate decreased by 16.5 percent from 20 firearm-related deaths per 100,000 persons in 1998 to 16.7/100,000 in 1999 (Table 1). The latter was the lowest firearm-related mortality rate in the eleven-year period from 1989 to 1999. The 1999 Arizona firearm-related mortality rate was 19.3 percent higher than the Arizona 2000 health objective of 14 weaponrelated deaths per 100,000 population. While fourth digit ICD codes are available to identify the type of firearm that was used, the vast majority of weapon types are coded on death certificates as ""other and unspecified"" (Table 3). All but a small fraction of firearmrelated fatalities are intentionally inflicted. Among 833 firearm-related deaths in 1999, 7 (or 0.8 percent)   F  IREARM  -R  ELATED  F  ATALITIES,  3  A  RIZONA,  1989-1999  The 1999 mortality rate from firearms among males 28.4/100,000) was 4.6 times greater than the rate of 6.2/100,000 among females (Figure 5, Table 8). Particularly high gender ratios in firearm mortality were evident in 1999 for Hispanics (male rate of 40.3 was 6.8 times the rate of 5.9 for females (Figure 9). Annual firearm-related homicide death rates among Arizona residents were at least 33 percent lower than the firearm-related suicide death rates from 1989 to 1999 (Figure 6). In each year from 1991 to 1997, annual firearm-related death rates among teenagers 15-19 years of age were the highest among the age groups. In 1999, as in 1998, the highest firearm-related death rates were among Arizonans 20-44 years old (Table 1). Between 1997 and 1999, the total firearm death rate among teenagers 15-19 years old decreased by 39.4 percent from 37.3 to 22.6 fatalities per 100,000 persons in this age group in 1999 (Table 1). The firearm-homicide rate decreased for the fourth consecutive year from 27.7/100,000 in 1995 to 12.9/100,000 in 1999 (Figure 7, Table 15). At the same time, the rate for firearm-suicide decreased by 54.5 percent from a rate of 18.0/100,000 in 1997 to 8.2/100,000 in 1999.  In any given year between 1989 and 1999, the annual firearm death rates for Arizona teenagers have been higher than their death rates associated with natural causes of death (such as chronic or infectious diseases) combined (Figure 8). One of every three deaths among teenagers 15-19 years in 1999 was by firearm (77 out of 277). Sixty-four deaths in Ar sixty-six of (Table 13) 1999. of every 100 suicide izona (Table 12) and every 100 murders involved firearms in  In Arizona, the age-adjusted rate of death by firearms in the 1999 period varied from 3.3/100,000 among La Paz County residents to a rate of 24.6 firearm deaths per 100,000 residents of Mohave County (Figure 13). Nationally, among the 50 states and the District of Columbia mortality rates for firearm-suicide ranged from a zero (no fatalities) in Delaware to 18.4 per 100,000 adolescents 15-19 years old in Alaska. Arizona ranked sixth highest in the nation (Figure 14). Mortality rates for firearmhomicide ranged from a zero (no fatalities) in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont to 100.9 per 100,000 persons 15-19 years old in the District of Columbia. Arizona ranked eight highest (Figure 15) among the 50 states and the District of Columbia.    F  IREARM  -R  ELATED  F  ATALITIES,  5  A  RIZONA,  1989-1999  FIGURES    F  IREARM  -R  ELATED  F  ATALITIES,  7  A  RIZONA,  1989-1999  Figure 1 Age Adjusted Firearm-Related Death Rates* by Year, Arizona and United States, 1989-1999 United States 25.0 21.0 24.0 24.4  Arizona  20.1  20.0  17.1  18.3 17.9  18.7  19.5  20.0 16.7  15.0 13.7  14.6  15.2 14.9  15.7 15.4 13.9 13.0 11.9 10.9  10.0  5.0  0.0  NA 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999  *Number of firearm-related deaths per 100,000 population (age-adjusted to 1940 standard).

GX240-52-0593385	"NEWS RELEASE  For Immediate Release May 7, 2003 For more information, contact: Brenda Bodily Utah Diabetes Prevention and Control Program Office: 801-538-6896 Cell: 801-710-4675  Small Steps to Prevent Diabetes Give Big Rewards (Salt Lake City, UT)  New studies show that treating pre-diabetes through physical activity and a nutritious meal plan, can cut a person's risk of developing type 2 diabetes by more than half. The Utah Department of Health (UDOH) has received funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to address prevention in its statewide diabetes efforts.  The UDOH's newly named Diabetes Prevention and Control Program (DPCP), formerly known as the Diabetes Control Program, will begin its first prevention campaign, ""Small Steps. Big Rewards."" to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes.  ""The new campaign will inform Utahns with pre-diabetes that small lifestyle changes in physical activity and nutrition can dramatically reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes,"" said Brenda Bodily, DPCP information specialist. ""Thirty minutes of moderate physical activity a day, five times a week, combined with a five to seven percent weight loss is typically all a person needs to treat pre-diabetes and effectively reduce his or her risk of developing type 2 diabetes."" DPCP will air public service announcements on radio and television and distribute educational materials stressing that anyone can make these small changes to delay or prevent type 2 diabetes.  - MORE -   Page 2 of 2 - Small Steps to Prevent Diabetes Give Big Rewards  Pre-diabetes is not a new diagnosis  it was previously known as impaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glucose. Nearly always a precursor to type 2 diabetes, pre-diabetes occurs in people who have blood sugar levels higher than normal, but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 16 million adults ages 40 to 74 years have pre-diabetes. Adults with pre-diabetes have a 50 percent higher risk of heart attack or stroke. Unfortunately, similar to type 2 diabetes, many people with pre-diabetes don't know they have it. Diagnosing pre-diabetes is critical because of the potential to delay or prevent type 2 diabetes.  Pre-diabetes symptoms are similar to those for type 2 diabetes. Blurry vision, constant thirst, fatigue, tingling and numbness in the hands and feet are a few of the more common symptoms. Because many of these symptoms are easy to ignore getting screened for pre-diabetes can be the most important step to prevent type 2 diabetes. Risk factors for type 2 diabetes include being over the age of 45, overweight, of a minority ethnic or racial group, having a family history of diabetes, inactivity or having had a baby weighing more than nine-pounds at birth.  DPCP estimates that approximately 120,000 Utahns have diabetes. Of those diagnosed with diabetes, 9095 percent have type 2 diabetes. Diabetes is the sixth leading cause of death in Utah. The cost of hospitalizations related to diabetes is nearly $240 million per year. The complications associated with undiagnosed or uncontrolled diabetes can include blindness, amputation, kidney disease, heart attack or stroke.

digested food for growth and energy. Most of the food we eat is broken down by the digestive juices into a simple sugar called glucose. Glucose is the main source of fuel for the body. When we eat, the pancreas is supposed to automatically produce the right amount of insulin to move the glucose from our blood into our cells. In people with diabetes, however, the pancreas either produces little or no insulin, or the body cells do not respond to the insulin that is produced. As a result, glucose builds up in the blood, overflows into the urine, and passes out of the body. Thus, the body loses its main source of fuel even though the blood contains large amounts of glucose.           Diabetes can cause serious health complications including heart disease, blindness, kidney failure, and lower-extremity amputations.    Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States.     An estimated 16 million people in the United States have diabetes mellitus--a serious, lifelong condition. About half of these people do not know they have diabetes and are not under care for the disorder. Each year, about 798,000 people are diagnosed with diabetes.                HHS  Issues National Plan To Reduce Impact Of Diabetes On Women    March 25, 2003 -  HHS Secretary Tommy G. Thompson today  introduced a national plan to address the growing health epidemic of diabetes in  women.  Diabetes is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and is  a major contributor to heart disease, the number one killer of women.                                                                 Two          Websites Devoted To Diabetes            May 6, 2002  -           The FDA has launched a pair of Websites with information for consumers          on diabetes, a disease that affects more than 17 million Americans.  One          site gives general background on the disease and FDA's role; the other          site is part of the agencys Take Time to Care campaign, targeted at          early detection and treatment of diabetes in women.                                                           FDA Diabetes Information  and                                                 Take Time to Care  .                                 The National Diabetes Information Clearinghouse, Diabetes  Dictionary  defines the different types of diabetes as:        Type I diabetes :        A chronic condition in which the pancreas makes little or no insulin because the beta cells have been destroyed. The body is then not able to use the glucose (blood sugar) for energy. Type I diabetes usually comes on abruptly, although the damage to the beta cells may begin much earlier. The signs of Type I diabetes are a great thirst, hunger, a need to urinate often, and loss of weight. To treat the disease, the person must inject insulin, follow a diet plan, exercise daily, and test blood glucose several times a day. Type I diabetes usually occurs in children and adults who are under age 30. This type of diabetes used to be known as juvenile diabetes, juvenile-onset diabetes, and ketosis-prone diabetes, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM).        New      Resources To Treat Type 1 Diabetes  In October 2001, the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR), a part of the National      Institutes of Health (NIH), announced the award of grants in the      amount of $10.4 million to establish 10 Islet Cell Resource (ICR) centers.     Type II diabetes         The most common form of diabetes mellitus; about 90 to 95 percent of people who have diabetes have type II diabetes. Unlike Type I diabetes, in which the pancreas makes no insulin, people with Type II diabetes produce some insulin, sometimes even large amounts. However, either their bodies do not produce enough insulin or their body cells are resistant to the action of insulin. People with Type II diabetes can often control their condition by losing weight through diet and exercise. If not, they may need to combine insulin or a pill with diet and exercise. Generally, Type II diabetes occurs in people who are over age 40. Most of the people who have this type of diabetes are overweight. Type II diabetes used to be called adult-onset diabetes, maturity-onset diabetes, ketosis-resistant diabetes, and stable diabetes and noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).                   Diet          and Exercise Dramatically Delay Type-2 Diabetes           At least 10 million Americans at high risk for Type-2 diabetes can          sharply lower their chances of getting the disease with diet and          exercise, according to the findings of a major clinical trial. The          diabetes medication Metformin is also effective .

It usually provides a written contract between the resident                  and the community, which offers a continuum of housing, services                  and health care services, commonly all on one campus. CCRC residents                  enjoy an independent lifestyle with the knowledge that if they                  become sick or frail, their needs will continue to be met. In                  general, residents are expected to move into the community while                  they are still independent and able to take care of themselves.

First, their population in the United States is increasing rapidly,          primarily due to the recent large influx of immigrants. Second, they are          diverse, with some subgroups experiencing higher rates of social, health,          and mental health problems than others. For example, poverty rates are          higher among Southeast Asians and Pacific Islanders than among AA/PIs          as a whole. Third, AA/PIs may collectively exhibit a wide range of strengths          (e.g., family cohesion, educational achievements, motivation for upward          mobility, and willingness to work hard) and risk factors (e.g., premigration          traumas, English language difficulties, minority group status, and culture          conflict), which again point to the diversity within the population. Fourth,          very little national data are available that describe the prevalence of          mental disorders using standardized DSM criteria. In terms of what is          known about mental health issues among AA/PIs, several conclusions are          warranted:          1.   Our knowledge of the mental health needs of Asian Americans is very limited. Two of the most prominent psychiatric epidemiological studies, the ECA          and the NCS, included extremely small samples of AA/PIs and were not conducted          in any of the Asian languages. The only contemporary study of AA/PIs using          DSM criteria is CAPES, but it is limited to one Asian ethnic group and          focuses primarily on mood disorders. No study has addressed the          rates of mental disorders for Pacific Islander American ethnic groups.          When symptom scales are used, Asian Americans do show an elevated level          of depressive symptoms compared to white Americans. Although these          studies have been informative, most of them have focused on Chinese Americans,          Japanese Americans, and Southeast Asians. Few studies exist on the mental          health needs of other large ethnic groups such as Filipino Americans,          Hmong Americans, and Pacific Islanders.          2.   Available mental health studies suggest that the overall prevalence of          mental health problems and disorders does not significantly differ from          the prevalence rates for other Americans, although the distribution of          disorders may be different. This means that AA/PIs are not “mentally          healthier” than other populations. For example, they may have          lower rates of some disorders but higher rates of others, such as          neurasthenia. Types of mental health problems appear to depend on level          of acculturation. Those who are less Westernized appear to exhibit culture-          bound syndromes more frequently than those who are more acculturated.          The acculturated population shows more Western types of disorders. Furthermore,          the rates of disorders vary according to within-group differences.          Rates tend to be higher among Southeast Asian refugees, for instance.                 3.   Without greater knowledge of the rate and distribution of particular          disorders and the factors associated with mental health, care providers          have a difficult time devising optimal intervention to treat mental          disorders and promote well-being.          4.   AA/PIs have the lowest rates of utilization of mental health services          among ethnic populations. This underrepresentation is characteristic of          most AA/PI groups, regardless of gender, age, and geographic location.          Among those who use services, severity of disturbance is high. The explanation          for this seems to be that individuals delay using services until problems          are very serious. The unmet need for services among AA/PIs is unfortunate,          because mental health treatment can be very beneficial.          5.   The low utilization of mental health services is attributable to stigma and shame over using services, lack of financial resources, conceptions          of health and treatment that differ from those under-lying Western mental          health services, cultural inappropriateness of services (e.g., lack of          providers who speak the same languages as limited english proficiency          clients), and the use of alternative resources within the AA/PI communities.                 6.   Attention to ethnic or culture-specific forms of intervention and to racial          or ethnic differences in treatment response is warranted to effect greater          service utilization and more positive mental health outcomes. The ethnic          matching of therapists with clients and the services of ethnic-specific          programs have been found to be associated with increased use of services          and favorable treatment outcomes. The development of culturally          and linguistically competent services should be of the highest priority          in providing mental health care for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.          Attention must also be paid to differences in responses to medication          because effective dosage levels of psychotropic medication may vary          considerably among Asian Americans, with many people requiring lower than          average doses to achieve therapeutic effects.          7.   It is imperative that more research be conducted on the AA/PI population. Priority should be given to investigations that focus on particular AA/PI          groups, the rate and distribution of mental health problems (including          culture-bound syndromes), culturally competent forms of intervention,          and preventive strategies that can promote mental health.

GX028-86-14173389	"WOMEN OF COLOR HEALTH DATA BOOK     FACTORS AFFECTING THE HEALTH OF WOMEN   OF COLOR     Asian Americans     Although health issues for Asian Americans and Pacific Islander   Americans often are analyzed jointly, in this fact book the groups are separated. Native   Pacific Islanders are considered Native Americans and are discussed with American   Indians/Alaska Natives. (See discussion of Pacific Islanders in section on Native   Americans.) Asian populations are discussed together. This change is made because native   Pacific Islanders are only 5 percent of the Asian and Pacific Islander total and often   have health outcomes more akin to those of American Indians/Alaska Natives than to Asian   subpopulations. In addition, native Pacific Islanders are not immigrants to the United   States as are Asian populations. Thus, an effort has been made throughout to disaggregate   Asians from Pacific Islanders whenever possible, and to display data for the groups   separately. Aggregate statistics for Asians and Pacific Islanders are used, however, when   they are the best available.      Asian Americans are immigrants to the United States (and their   descendants) from more than 20 countries who speak more than 100 different languages. They   come from places such as China, India, Japan, the Philippines, Korea, Laos, Cambodia,   Vietnam, and Thailand and represent more than 60 different ethnicities (22). In 1990, the   largest subpopulations (in descending order) were persons of Chinese, Filipino, Japanese,   Asian Indian, Korean, and Southeast Asian ancestry. By the year 2000, Filipinos are   projected to be the largest Asian subpopulation, followed by Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean,   and Japanese Americans, in that order (120).     The numbers of Asians and Pacific Islanders in the United States   (both males and females) have grown from 1.5 million in 1970 to more than 7.2 million in   1990, and more than 9 million in 1996, making them the fastest growing minority group in   the United States. The 1990 Census counted 6.9 million persons of Asian ancestry and more   than 365,000 Pacific Islanders among the 7.2 million population (21). Asian and Pacific   Islanders are currently more than 3 percent of the total U.S. population and nearly 13   percent of all people of color (1). Asian and Pacific Islander women represent 13 percent   of all women of color and 52 percent of all Asian and Pacific Islander Americans (1).      The majority of Asian Americans—more than 90   percent—reside in metropolitan centers. The states with the largest shares of Asian   and Pacific Islander Americans are California, Hawaii, and Washington. More than 55   percent of all Asians and Pacific Islanders live in these three states, with the remainder   living in New York, New Jersey, Illinois, and Texas (25). Among all the states, Asians and   Pacific Islanders are the largest proportion of the population of Hawaii—62 percent   (2). When growth of the Asian and Pacific Islander population by state is examined between   1980 and 1990, however, the five states with the largest increases—Rhode Island (246   percent), New Hampshire (219 percent), Georgia (210 percent), Wisconsin (195 percent), and   Minnesota (194 percent)—are neither West Coast states nor states traditionally   considered as homes for large numbers of Asians and Pacific Islanders (24).     Major Subpopulations     The varied histories of the many Asian subpopulations who have   immigrated to the United States contribute to the wide, bipolar distribution in their   socioeconomic positions and health. Most Asian immigrants have come to the United States   since 1965, when the Supreme Court struck down immigration quotas based on national origin   and when only about 1 million Asians were in the United States. Chinese immigration to   this country, however, dates back to the mid-1800s. With the decline of the African slave   trade and the discovery of gold, waves of mostly male Chinese were brought to the United   States as cheap, docile laborers to work in the mines and on the railroads in the Western   states. This new servant class became the new ""negro"" for the white majority and   was even referred to as ""nagurs"" by some (121). Later labeled the ""yellow   peril,"" or disease-ridden and heathen, the Chinese were barred from entering the   United States on the basis of race alone by the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. This ban   remained in effect until 1943, and it was 1952 before immigrant Chinese were able to   become U.S. citizens (23,122).     In the 1960-1985 period, the Chinese population of the United States   quadrupled, and immigrants from more diverse ethnic and social strata came to the United   States (23,122). Between 1980 and 1990, the Chinese American population doubled, mostly   due to immigration; 63 percent of all Chinese Americans are foreign born (23). In 1990,   more than 1.6 million persons of Chinese descent resided in the United States and   constituted 23 percent of the Asian American population (123). Although Chinese Americans   live throughout the United States, the largest concentrations are found in California   (more than 700,000) and in New York state (more than 284,000) (124). Because Chinese   Americans are diverse in class, occupation, and regional and linguistic background, in   many Chinese American communities, unity is an elusive goal (25). Differences between   foreign-born and American-born, urban residents and suburbanites, old timers and   newcomers, northerners and southerners, Catholics and Protestants, Christians and   Buddhists, professionals and laborers, and rich and poor frequently override a common   ethnic identity (125).     The second largest Asian American subpopulation in the United States   is Filipino Americans. Beginning with U.S. intervention in the Philippine Islands,   Filipinos have migrated to both Hawaii and the mainland United States in three major waves   (23). Between 1903 and 1910, a first wave of Filipinos came to the United States to attend   educational institutions; a second wave migrated after World War II to work in agriculture   in Hawaii and on the mainland United States. The third wave, consisting of fewer single   men, more family groups, and more highly educated people, began after 1965 and continues   today (25). Evidence of this third wave is the 81 percent increase in the Filipino   population of the United States between 1980 and 1990. In 1990, Filipino Americans   numbered 1.4 million and were 19 percent of the Asian American population (123). More than   64 percent of Filipino Americans are foreign born (23).     Immigration from Japan to both Hawaii and the mainland United States   began in large numbers around 1885 and peaked between 1900 and 1910. The National Origins   Act barred Japanese and other Asians from entering the United States after 1924 and   contributed to the marked distinctions between the first-generation Japanese Americans   (Issei) and second (Nisei) and subsequent generations (23,25). Because first-generation   Japanese Americans, many of whom were relocated and interned in prison camps in the United   States during World War II, migrated to the United States when Japan had a single language   without significant dialects, they have a stronger sense of nationalism than the   immigrants constituting later generations (23). This sense of national identity among the   Issei has been posited as the explanation for the strong identity among this particular   group of immigrants. Today’s Japanese American population of 847,562 (11 percent of   all Asian Americans) resides primarily in California and Hawaii. More than 70 percent of   all Japanese Americans were born in the United States.     The more than 800,000 Asian Indian Americans (11 percent of all   Asian Americans) live primarily in the Eastern United States, although nearly 160,000   Asian Indians live in California (21,25,123). New York state is home to the second largest   number (nearly 141,000) of Asian Indians. In 1992, the majority of births to Asian women   in the states of Illinois (home to more than 64,000 Asian Indians) and New Jersey (home to   more than 79,000 Asian Indians) were to Asian Indian women (35). Asian Indians have   migrated to the United States in largest numbers since 1965, though some had come to the   Western United States in the early 1900s, after initially migrating to British Columbia.   Although they are of differing ethnic groups and backgrounds, most share a common   tradition of non-western medical practice (Ayurvedic), and many are highly educated   professionals (21,25).     Korean Americans, one of the most homogeneous Asian populations in   terms of language, ethnicity, and culture, also are one of the fastest growing Asian   subpopulations in the United States (21). Their population increased more than tenfold   between 1970 (70,000 population) and 1990 (800,000 population) to make Korean Americans 11   percent of the current total U.S. Asian population (123,126). Korean Americans first   migrated to the United States in response to unstable conditions such as drought, famine,   and epidemics in their homeland in the late 1800s and early 1900s, which sent them to   Hawaii and the United States mainland primarily as contract laborers (127). Others have   migrated as a result of United States-Korean interaction during the Korean War (e.g.,   wives of servicemen; orphans adopted by Americans) (23). The Korean population of the   United States more than doubled between 1980 and 1990, with most of the growth due to   immigration; in 1990, more than 80 percent of all Korean Americans were foreign born.   Post-1965 Korean immigrants tend to come to the United States as families, and most tend   to be well educated.     Southeast Asians began to migrate to the United States primarily   after 1975, as the conflicts in that region in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam were winding   down. The majority of refugees of these conflicts to come to the United States were   Vietnamese (66 percent), with Cambodians and Laotians each constituting roughly 20 percent   of Southeast Asian immigrants (23). The earlier waves of refugees during the post-1975   period generally were better educated and wealthier than later arrivals, many of   whom—especially Hmong (a Chinese-origin population that migrated to Laos and later to   Thailand and the United States) and Laotians—were poor, illiterate, and not at all   used to western culture at the time of their resettlement. The trauma of dislocation and   resettlement is related to many of the health problems of these Asian subpopulations.   About 615,000 Vietnamese, 149,000 Laotians, 147,000 Cambodians, and more than 90,000 Hmong   resided in the United States in 1990 (23). Most Southeast Asians live in Western states,   led by the 46 percent of Vietnamese and the 48 percent of Cambodians living in California   (128,129).     Factors Affecting   Health     The ""model minority"" image replaced the negative   stereotypes applied to Chinese and other Asian Americans in 1966. Coming shortly after the   1965 Watts riots in Los Angeles, the identification of a model minority is viewed by some   as an attempt to provide proof that the U.S. social system does work for minorities   (24,121). However, Asians often are pitted against other minority groups and are made   scapegoats by low-income whites and other minorities who indirectly blame Asians for their   failure to succeed and claim that Asians take away their educational and job   opportunities. The ""model minority"" epithet has direct implications for the   health and economic status of Asian Americans. It tends to trivialize the health problems   of Asians, suggesting that they can take care of these problems on their own and overlooks   the diversity among Asians and the problems faced by some of the newest refugees (130).     The health problems of Asian Americans are worsened by a complex set   of cultural, linguistic, structural, and financial barriers to care. In 1980, a language   other than English was spoken at home by nine out of 10 Asian Americans who were 5 years   of age or older (131). In 1992, 42 percent of the Vietnamese American population 5 years   of age and older lived in a linguistically isolated household—that is, a household in   which no person age 14 years and older speaks only English, and no person age 14 years and   older, who speaks a language other than English, also speaks English ""very well""   (35). Nearly three-fifths of Asian Americans are foreign-born, and, in 1992, only 17   percent of all Asian mothers who gave birth in the United States had been born in the   United States (35). If residing illegally in the United States, Asian Americans may not   seek out medical care for fear that this will expose their illegal status and result in   deportation.      Since many Asians are unable to communicate in English, they are not   readily employable. When employed, it is often in small businesses or sweat-shop-type   factories with unsafe and unhealthy working conditions and no fringe benefits such as   health insurance. Three-fifths of all Asian and Pacific Islander women were in the labor   force in 1990, with more than a fifth (22 percent) employed in administrative occupations.   One-sixth (17 percent) of Asian and Pacific Islander females had professional specialty   occupations, while an additional 16 percent had service occupations (132).     Although only 15 percent of all Asians and Pacific Islanders and   only 29 percent of all households headed by Asian and Pacific Islander females reported   incomes below the federal poverty level in 1995, these averages mask considerable   variation among subpopulations (133). For example, the percentage of the population below   the poverty level ranged from a low of 6 percent among Japanese Americans to a high of 66   percent among Laotians in 1990 (compared to about 13 percent for the entire U.S.   population) (37). The proportion of Vietnamese families reporting incomes below the   poverty level in 1990 (24 percent) was more than three times as great as that for Asian   Indian families (7 percent) (35). Hmong and Cambodian Americans reported poverty levels   above 45 percent (23).     Both household and individual incomes for Asian Americans support   the finding of disparate poverty rates among the subpopulations. In 1980, Asian Americans   had average household income of $6,900, less than the United States average of $7,400. At   that time, only Indonesian, Chinese, and Japanese Americans had average per capita incomes   above the U.S. average (23). In 1990, the median family income for Asian and Pacific   Islanders was $35,900 (higher than the $35,000 median family income for non-Hispanic white   Americans), and 37 percent of all Asian and Pacific Islander American households had   annual incomes of at least $50,000. At the same time, more than 5 percent of Asian and   Pacific Islander households had incomes of less than $5,000, and nearly 12 percent had   incomes of less than $10,000 (134). The resettlement of more than 1million Indochinese   refugees in the 1970s and 1980s made the bimodal distribution even more pronounced because   refugees arriving after 1979 have experienced higher rates of unemployment,   underemployment, and poverty than other Asian Americans, and other minorities (37). For   example, in 1980, unemployment among the Hmong (20 percent), Laotians (15 percent), and   Cambodians (11 percent) all exceeded the U.S. average (23).     Health insurance coverage varies among Asian American women, as do   employment and income levels. Eighty-one percent of all Asian and Pacific Islander women   and 91 percent of Asian and Pacific Islander women ages 65 years and older reported having   either private or public health insurance coverage in 1995 (133). Fourteen percent of   Asian and Pacific Islander women reported Medicaid coverage and nearly 7 percent reported   Medicare coverage. Nearly two-thirds (66 percent) of Asian and Pacific Islander women had   private health insurance. Despite high rates of coverage in general, selected   subpopulations of Asians lack health insurance, and this lack of health insurance causes   some Asian American women to become frequent users of hospital emergency rooms. One study   of Korean American residents in Los Angeles County found that 50 percent of those under 65   years of age and 45 percent of those 65 year of age and older had no health insurance   (135).     Although Asian American women overall exhibit healthful lifestyle   behaviors, such as a lower smoking prevalence (10 percent) than among other American women   (25 percent), there is variation by subpopulation in both healthful behaviors and the   prevalence of illness (24). For example, this 10 percent overall smoking prevalence   aggregates higher rates among Japanese American (19 percent of whom reported smoking in   one California study) and Filipino Ameri-can (11 percent of whom reported smoking in the   same study) with the lower rates of Chinese women (7 percent of whom reported smoking in   the California study) (136).      The risk of hypertension also varies by subpopulation. In another   study of the California population, hypertension was found to be more of a problem for   Filipino Americans (25 percent) than for either Chinese (16 percent) or Japanese (13   percent) Americans (128). Only 9 percent of Vietnamese females in California reported   hypertension compared to 16 percent of all females in the state population. The lowest   hypertension rate was reported among Korean American females in California, only 3 percent   of whom reported the condition (128).     Other conditions, such as tuberculosis, are more common among Asian   populations than among other racial/ethnic groups. The prevalence of tuberculosis among   Asian Americans, the highest among all groups, is nearly 4 times that among the general   population (24,137). Hepatitis B and certain genetic abnormalities also are more common   among Asian subpopulations.     The lack of knowledge of risk factors or preventive behaviors for   various diseases also is a problem for Asian Americans. One study among Southeast Asian   populations in central Ohio revealed that 94 percent of those surveyed did not know what   blood pressure is, and 85 percent did not know what could be done to prevent heart disease   (128). The lack of knowledge about cancer risk factors, for example, results in the   failure to conduct breast self-examinations or to get screening such as mammography or Pap   smears to lessen the incidence of breast or cervical cancer (24).     The failure of Asian women to get regular screenings relates not   only to a lack of knowledge of risk factors but also to the belief that cancer is   inevitably fatal. One survey of Vietnamese women in San Francisco found that more than   half (52 percent) believed ""there is little one can do to prevent cancer"" (138).   Although virtually all of the women surveyed (97 percent) had heard of cancer, many did   not know common signs, symptoms, and risk factors for either breast or cervical cancer.   Vietnamese women who have migrated to the United States more recently (post 1981) were   more likely (76 percent) to have never had the Papanicolaou test for cervical cancer than   women who had migrated before 1981 (33 percent) (138). In a survey of Vietnamese women in   western Massachusetts, just over 50 percent of respondents reported having had the Pap   test, less than the 57 percent of all U.S. women 18 years and older who reported having   had this test in 1991 (139,140).     The failure to get mammograms is of particular concern because of   the gradual increase in breast cancer rates among Asian women (especially Chinese,   Japanese, and Filipino) over the generations after their migration to the United States,   when compared to these same groups of women in Asia. Overall, Asian American women born in   the United States have a breast cancer risk 60 percent higher than Asian American women   born in Asia (141).     Prenatal care is another form of preventive care that many Asian   American women do not receive. Nearly half of Cambodian and Laotian American women do not   begin prenatal care during their first trimester and have higher risk births because of   this (137,142). Of the five major Indochinese groups in Oregon (Khmer, Hmong, Mien, other   Lao, and Vietnamese), Hmong American women had the least favorable birth risk profile   (142). Mean birth weight among Hmong infants born in California between 1985 and 1988 was   significantly lower than mean birth weight among white infants (143). The preterm and   low-weight infants born to Hmong, Cambodian, and Laotian mothers in 1992 are reflected in   the aggregate rates of 12 percent (preterm) and 7 percent (low birth weight) for births to   all women in the category ""Remaining Asian or Pacific Islander Total."" These   rates are higher than for Vietnamese mothers (10 percent preterm and 6 percent low birth   weight), and also higher than for white non-Hispanic mothers (8 percent preterm and 5   percent low birth weight) (35).     Even with health insurance, culturally accepted medical models such   as acupuncture and herbal medicines often are not covered services, a fact that further   limits access to health care (36). Asian American women are more likely to report using   traditional health practices and medicines than Asian men—69 percent versus 39   percent. By ethnic group, nearly all Cambodian women (96 percent), nearly a fifth (18   percent) of Laotian women, and nearly two-thirds of Chinese women (64 percent) report   using traditional health practices (144). High non-compliance with western prescription   medications among these populations clearly becomes a concern. Non-English-speaking   Chinese hypertensives, for example, exhibit such non-compliance, perhaps in deference to   traditional treatments (24).     Fear of difficulties in communicating—compounded by shame,   guilt, anger, depression, and other responses to certain stigmatized conditions such as   mental retardation, substance abuse, and HIV/AIDS—also may deter Asian Americans from   seeking care promptly (37). Chinese Americans in particular have been documented to   underuse mental health services (145). The traumas due to war (e.g., torture, starvation,   rape, forced labor, and witnessing murder), leaving one’s homeland, and resettling in   another land often result in unique medical conditions, such as the psychosomatic or   non-organic blindness reported among Cambodian women 40 years of age and older. Even if   Asian American patients seek care, language barriers make conditions such as this   difficult to diagnose and treat (129). To compound their stresses and trauma, many poor   Southeast Asian immigrants resettle in violent, inner-city environments in the United   States (146). Depression is also found among Korean Americans, most of whom are recent   immigrants but who migrated to the United States without war-related trauma; this mental   health problem is more common among Korean Americans than it is among either Chinese,   Japanese, or Filipino Americans (126).     In addition, not all English medical/health terminology can be   readily translated into the various Southeast Asian languages, nor can many Southeast   Asian expressions describing physical and mental conditions be directly translated for   U.S. health care providers. Cancer, for example, has a counterpart in Cantonese (the word   nham, which loosely translates into English as ""growth"") but is not mentioned as   a disease in texts on Chinese medicine. Thus, it may be difficult for Asian patients to   accept their diagnoses as real or to accept western treatment regimens for them (124).      If Asian Americans get to health care providers and translators are   available, communication still is not guaranteed and appropriate care still may not be   received (147). For example, differences between the medical systems in the United States   and China constitute a further deterrent to Chinese Americans born in China but in need of   health care in the United States. In China, physicians generally prescribe and dispense   medication, charging only a nominal fee for their services; the major cost for the visit   is the medications (124). Because the idea of a visit to a medical professional for a   checkup without getting prescriptions for medications does not live up to the expectations   of many Chinese Americans, they are reluctant to make visits for routine or preventive   care. In addition, 90 percent of the obstetricians and gynecologists in China are female,   a fact that makes it very difficult for foreign-born Chinese American women to be examined   by or receive care from the predominantly male practitioners in these medical specialties   in the United States (124).     Some Korean American women, many of whom have extreme difficulty   with English, report using han yak, a Korean medicine, and other over-the-counter Korean   home remedies rather than going to physicians in the United States (137). They avoid going   to physicians because of ""communication difficulties,"" ""impatient""   doctors and nurses, being ""treated disrespectfully"" because of their ethnicity,   and other ""bad experiences"" (137).      Other cultural characteristics that influence the health of Asian   Americans are familism, reverence for authority, and a sense of shame/pride. Asian   cultures—like Hispanic cultures—often emphasize family decisionmaking. The   practice of family decisionmaking may be heightened by necessity, or it may be rendered   impotent within the socioeconomic context of U.S. society (135). The reverence for   authority common in Asian societies with hierarchical structures, such as in Korea, for   example, may result in a Korean American patient not questioning a physician’s   diagnosis and treatment and indicating understanding, agreement, and compliance when there   is none (37). This reverence for authority also may combine with gender role   differentiation to make Asian women reluctant to report domestic violence to either health   providers or law enforcement authorities (146,148).     The strong desire to ""keep up appearances"" within the   community has resulted in low utilization of addiction treatment services for alcoholism   and substance abuse by Asian Americans. Although little research has been done on either   alcohol or substance abuse among Asian American women, available research suggests that   Asians use and abuse alcohol and other substances less frequently than members of other   racial/ethnic groups (120). Low drinking rates among all Asian American groups seem to be   due to high percentages of abstainers among the foreign-born populations (120).      One study of Asian Americans in Los Angeles found that among women,   Japanese Americans were the most likely to report being drinkers (73 percent), followed by   Chinese (49 percent), and Koreans (25 percent) (149). High rates of alcohol consumption   also have been noted among persons with one Asian and one Caucasian parent (85). Filipino   women are least likely to report the use of alcoholic beverages. Alcohol use among Asian   American women tends to increase with acculturation. In addition, stressors such as   divorce and widowhood are associated with both depression and substance abuse for these   women (85). Although risk factors for and patterns of substance use and abuse have been   identified among selected Asian youth populations, prevalence is generally lower than   among youth of other racial/ethnic groups (120).     The vast differences between Asian societies and the United States   mean that the most basic economic and socio-emotional needs of new immigrants may not be   met by existing institutions. The painful process of acculturation produces high levels of   stress and may produce a high prevalence of mental illness among Asian Americans (94).   Some of this mental illness results from frustration at not reaping benefits in the form   of high-paying, high-status jobs, commensurate with their expectations based on the level   of education attained and the benefits reaped by white Americans with comparable education   (150). Gender stereotyping of Asian women as docile and subservient also constitutes a   stressor that may contribute to depression and mental illness (151). The major mental   health problem for Asian Americans, though, is racism—which adversely affects their   psycho-economic status, as well as the status of other peoples of color (36).

Unless these dangerous trends are halted, the impact on our nation's health and medical care costs will be overwhelming."" Jeffrey P. Koplan, MD, MPH Director, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 19982002  Revised March 2003  DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION SAFER  HEALTHIER  PEOPLETM   Diabetes Is a Growing Public Health Problem More than 17 million Americans have diabetes, and over 200,000 people die each year of related complications. Diabetes can cause heart disease, stroke, blindness, kidney failure, pregnancy complications, amputations of the leg, foot, and toe, as well as deaths related to flu and pneumonia. Particularly at risk are the 5.9 million Americans who are unaware that they have the disease. The number of U.S. adults with diagnosed diabetes (including women with gestational diabetes) has increased 61% since 1991 and is projected to more than double by 2050. People with diabetes have a shortage of insulin or a decreased ability to use insulin, a hormone that allows glucose (sugar) to enter cells and be converted to energy. When diabetes is not controlled, glucose and fats remain in the blood and, over time, damage vital organs. Now the sixth leading cause of death in America, diabetes has its greatest effects on the elderly, women, and certain racial and ethnic groups. One in five adults over age 65 has diabetes. African American, Hispanic, American Indian, and Alaska Native adults are about 23 times more likely than white adults to have diabetes. There are two main types of diabetes. Type 1 most often appears during childhood or adolescence. Type 2 affects 90%95% of people with diabetes and most often appears after age 40. However, it is no longer considered an adult-only disease. It is now being found at younger ages and is even being diagnosed among children and teens. Type 2 diabetes is linked to obesity and physical inactivity, both of which can be modified to improve health. Some women develop diabetes during pregnancy. Known as gestational diabetes, this condition affects 2%5% of all pregnancies. Other, less common forms of diabetes result from genetic syndromes, surgery, drugs, malnutrition, infections, and other illnesses. In addition, millions of Americans are at high risk for developing diabetes. These people have prediabetes-- that is, their blood sugar level is elevated but is not high enough to be classified as diabetes. An estimated 16 million U.S. adults aged 4074 have prediabetes. Diabetes costs the nation nearly $132 billion a year. The average yearly health care cost for a person with diabetes was $13,243 in 2002, compared with $2,560 for a person without diabetes. Diabetes costs represented 11% of national health care expenditures during 2002. These estimates are low, however, because they do not take into account the cost of undiagnosed diabetes, care provided by nonpaid caregivers, or expenditures for dental, optometry, and dietitian services, which probably are used at higher rates by people with diabetes than by others.  Many Complications of Diabetes Can Be Prevented Eye disease and blindness. Each year, 12,00024,000 people in this country become blind because of diabetic eye disease. Regular eye exams and timely treatment could prevent up to 90% of diabetes-related blindness. However, only 60% of people with diabetes receive annual dilated eye exams. Kidney disease. About 38,000 people with diabetes develop kidney failure each year, and over 100,000 are treated for this condition. Treatment to better control blood pressure and blood glucose levels could reduce diabetes-related kidney failure by about 50%. Amputations. About 82,000 people have diabetesrelated leg, foot, or toe amputations each year. Foot care programs that include regular examinations and patient education could prevent up to 85% of these amputations. Cardiovascular disease. Heart disease and stroke cause about 65% of deaths among people with diabetes. These deaths could be reduced by 30% with 2  improved care to control blood pressure and blood glucose and lipid levels. Pregnancy complications. About 18,000 women with preexisting diabetes deliver babies each year, and an estimated 135,000 expectant mothers learn they have gestational diabetes. These women and their babies have an increased risk for serious complications such as stillbirths, congenital malformations, and the need for cesarean sections. Women with gestational diabetes and their babies also have a greater likelihood of becoming obese and developing diabetes later in life. These complications and risks can be reduced with screenings and diabetes care before, during, and after pregnancy. Flu- and pneumonia-related deaths. Each year, 10,00030,000 people with diabetes die of complications from flu or pneumonia. They are roughly three times more likely to die of these complications than people without diabetes. However, only 55% of people with diabetes get an annual flu shot.   CDC Provides National Leadership and Builds Partnerships CDC provides leadership and funding to diabetes prevention and control programs nationwide. CDC also works with many partners to provide data for sound public health decisions, inform the public about diabetes, and ensure good care and education for Americans with diabetes. helping primary care practices to improve the health outcomes of people with diabetes. Practice teams and health plans collaborated to improve patients' blood sugar control. Results were encouraging for the 981 patients followed from 1999 through 2001: their blood sugar decreased on average by about 10%, and the percentage of patients who had poor blood sugar control declined from 24% to 17%. The projected cost savings from improved blood sugar control is about $419,000 a year.  Promote Effective State Programs With fiscal year 2003 funding of about $63 million, CDC provides limited support to 26 states, 8 territories, and the District of Columbia for capacity-building diabetes prevention and control programs and more substantial support to 24 states for basic implementation programs. In addition, CDC has worked with its partners to develop national public health performance standards for diabetes care. Partners include the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, National Association of County and City Health Officials, National Association of Local Boards of Health, American Public Health Association, and the Public Health Foundation. The CDC National Diabetes Program has adopted the concept of conducting assessments based on the 10 essential public health services (www.cdc.gov/diabetes). Results of the assessments will help to identify specific areas of strength and areas for improvement needed to develop the best public health programs for diabetes prevention and control.  Monitor the Burden and Translate Science Timely data and public health research are essential to better understand how diabetes affects different populations and how quality of care can be improved. CDC analyzes information from several national data sources, including the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, and explores ways to collect better diabetes data on groups most at risk. To translate scientific data into higher quality care, CDC works with many research partners, managed care organizations, and community health centers to assess how accepted standards of diabetes care are applied by health care providers and in clinical care settings. CDC and its partners also explore variations in the quality of diabetes care provided and develop and test strategies to move existing care practices closer to optimal standards.  Support Prevention Research Studies suggest that the progression of prediabetes to diabetes can be prevented or delayed. In 2001, results were announced from two landmark clinical trials-- the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study and the U.S. Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). Both studies demonstrated that sustained lifestyle changes, with modest weight loss and physical activity, resulted in substantial reductions in diabetes among older adults who were at very high risk for diabetes. Results from the DPP were so compelling that the trial was ended a year early. The lifestyle intervention worked equally well for men and women and all racial/ethnic groups, and it was most effective among people 60 or older.

The goal is to help people with diabetes to better manage the disease and promote policies that improve the quality of care provided and access to such care. NDEP partners also develop community interventions and tools to improve diabetes care and prevention, especially for communities with a high burden of diabetes and its complications. NDEP products are available on the Internet (www.ndep.nih.gov) and are produced in many different languages. CDC also develops other resources for health professionals, people with diabetes, and communities. For example, Diabetes Today is a train-the-trainer program that allows health professionals and community leaders to develop a community plan for preventing the complications of diabetes. A Spanish version of Diabetes Today is available, and a regional training site serves Hawaii and the Pacific Basin.  American, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian, and Asian American/Pacific Islander people.  National Agenda for Public Health Action for diabetes and women's health. This national agenda offers recommendations to help professionals, women and their families, health care systems, work sites, communities, and schools address the burden of diabetes among women. CDC, the American Diabetes Association, the American Public Health Association, and the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials are working with many partners to carry out the plan.  SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth. Rising rates of diabetes among youth are a growing public health concern. CDC and the National Institutes of Health are funding this 5-year, multicenter study to examine the current status of diabetes among U.S. children and adolescents. More than 5 million children, or 6% of all U.S. children 19 or younger, will be involved.  National Diabetes Collaborative. CDC, the Health Resources and Services Administration, and other federal partners have established this collaborative to improve diabetes care by fostering excellence in federally funded health center systems. Since 1999, over 270 health centers have adopted strategies to improve quality of care. In the first year alone, over 60% of diabetes patients at these centers had the A1C blood glucose test twice a year, as recommended. The A1C test detects problems early so that action can be taken to prevent disabling, costly complications.  Target Populations at Risk  Primary prevention for people most at risk. A healthy diet and modest physical activity can help people cut their risk for developing type 2 diabetes. CDC is developing methods to identify people at high risk for diabetes, policies to help these people reduce their risk, and public health programs that will slow the diabetes epidemic.  National Diabetes Prevention Center. CDC funds a center in Gallup, New Mexico, that is working with American Indian and Alaska Native communities to develop culturally relevant and scientifically sound interventions to prevent complications from diabetes.  National minority organizations. Through the NDEP, CDC collaborates with six national minority organizations to develop and deliver culturally and linguistically appropriate diabetes prevention and control messages to African  Future Directions CDC will continue to work with its partners to strengthen diabetes surveillance, prevention research, interventions, and communications. In support of Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson's Steps to a HealthierUS prevention initiative, CDC plans to increase the number of diabetes prevention and control programs that receive basic implementation funding, expand research and surveillance activities to address the unique needs of women and children with diabetes, develop and carry out a national public health strategy to address type 2 diabetes among children, and expand the activities of the National Diabetes Education Program.

Yet knowledge can go a long way in helping to prevent such outcomes. People who monitor their blood sugar regularly and maintain it within recommended levels can add years to their lives and greatly improve its quality. Thats why the National Diabetes Education Program, or NDEP, is aggressively taking its first public message, Control Your Diabetes. For Life, to minority communities. Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States. Of the almost 16 million people who have diabetes, one-third go undiagnosed because diabetes is generally asymptomatic until complications develop. Diabetes is also one of the most expensive health problems in the U.S., costing $98 billion a year or 13 percent of the total spent for U.S. health care, according to the November 1998 National Diabetes Fact Sheet from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It is the leading cause of adult blindness and endstage renal disease in the U.S. People with diabetes are five times more likely to have heart disease. It can also lead to many other health problems. Started in 1997 as a public-private partnership, NDEP aims to improve the treatment and outcomes for people with diabetes. It is also designed to promote early diagnosis, and ultimately, to prevent the onset of diabetes.

Since public awareness about diabetes was very low, the first goal of the NDEP was to inform patients with diabetes about the diseases complications. The message to the patient and general public was kept simple and stressed that diabetes is a serious, common, and costly disease, yet controllable. Last June, NDEP launched its first awareness campaign, Control Your Diabetes. For Life. The event and campaign messages received major coverage in national and local media outlets across the country. The goal of this ongoing awareness campaign is to encourage people with diabetes to manage their disease. People with diabetes benefit from getting consistent messages from multiple sources everywhere they go, Wong said. Numerous partners are involved at every level of the NDEP and are delivering the NDEP messages locally, in communities, where people live and work, she added. Wong also pointed out that minority organizations have been full partners of the NDEP from the very beginning of planning the program. We heard early on that many national programs are not successful because the people who know the minority populations the best were not actively engaged in identifying the needs, developing the messages, materials or strategies, or delivering the program, she said. The NDEP has four minority work groups: Hispanic/Latino, African American, American Indian/Alaska Native, and Asian American/Pacific Islander. These work groups have been deeply engaged in directing and developing the component of the NDEP unique for their respective populations. The Hispanic/Latino component of the Control Your Diabetes. For Life. campaign began in June 1998 and emphasizedin Spanish languagethat diabetes is serious, yet controllable. By the end of September 1998, print and broadcast news  stories had reached audiences of almost 12.5 million Hispanics and Latinos in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. The African American component began with a press briefing during the Congressional Black Caucus annual meeting last September in Washington, D.C. At that briefing, Surgeon General David Satcher called diabetes an epidemic within the African American community. The number of African Americans diagnosed with diabetes has tripled over the past 30 years, Dr. Satcher said. The NDEP is a key strategy of the Presidential Initiative on Race, which is designed to improve the health status of Americas racial and ethnic populations, including African Americans he added. During his remarks, Dr. Satcher called on all African Americans with diabetes to work with their health care providers to manage their disease. African Americans experience higher and more devastating rates of diabetes complications including eye disease, kidney failure, amputations, and premature deaths than Caucasians, according to Marcus Wilson, MD, national medical director of the Mutual of Omaha Company. It is crucial that we treat this disease as an epidemic and inform everyone about the long-term benefits of controlling diabetes, Dr. Wilson said during the press briefing. NDEP Steering Committee CoDirector Joanne Gallivan, MS, RD, director of NIDDKs Diabetes Outreach and Education Programs, said plans are underway for additional components of Control Your Diabetes. For Life. These campaigns, to be launched this year, will target American Indians/Alaska Natives and Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders. Our priority this year is to complete and introduce the targeted minority awareness campaigns and community intervention kit, and to continue expansion of the NDEP Partnerships Network nationally, Gallivan said. ...continued on page 3  Closing the Gap  2  February/March 1999   NDEP...from page 2  Surgeon General David Satcher calls on African Americans to control their diabetes during the campaign's kick off event held at the Congressional Black Caucus' annual meeting in Washington, DC, Sept. 1998.  These minority awareness campaigns will include products for TV, radio and print public service announcements, posters, brochures, and media kits. In our view, anyone and everyone in a community can get involved and make a contribution, Wong said. Community intervention kits have been put together that contain numerous ideas, how-to guidelines and tools for partners to use in planning and implementing simple diabetes awareness activities and programs to support people with diabetes. Many of NDEPs materials developed for the Control Your Diabetes. For Life campaign are now available on the campaigns Web site, http://ndep.nih.gov. As NDEP develops, additional  efforts will focus on:  people with undiagnosed diabetes and their families;  health care providers;  health care payers, purchasers and policymakers. NDEP continues to build partnerships for support of diabetes awareness and education to the targeted audiences. By identifying voluntary organizations and private companies as potential partners, NDEP brokers the collaboration of collective efforts in diabetes education, prevention and treatment. According to Wong, it is through these partnerships that NDEP constantly strives to develop a sense of future diabetes and health education program plans, exploring new ways to continually establish and exploit  mutually beneficial partnerships to help eliminate diabetes. Our role is to bring together diverse partners nationally to develop the vision, goals, objectives, priorities, messages, strategies, guidelines, tools and national partnerships for the program, Wong said. As for the future of the NDEP, Wong feels that strong partnership ties will make the difference. The full engagement of our minority partners has resulted in a strong band of mutual trust, respect, commitment and friendship that will help NDEP make a difference in the lives of people with diabetes, she said.

February/March 1999  3  Closing the Gap   Minority Health Perspective  Controlling Our Diabetes...and Our Lives By Nathan Stinson, Jr., PhD, MD, MPH, Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Minority Health  t is with pleasure and enthusiasm that I have accepted the post of Acting Director of the Office of Minority Health (OMH). Raising awareness of and controlling diabetes in minority communities is one of the many commitments my predecessor, Dr. Clay E. Simpson, and I share. Having served as Director of the Division of Programs for Special Populations at the Bureau of Primary Health Care, I witnessed first hand the devastating affect diabetes can have. Its a disease that is controllable, but it poses a special challenge for those hard to reach populations like minorities and the poor. Diabetes is a disease that, for many, requires medication and treatment, and significant diet and lifestyle changes. Without proper knowledge of the risk factors and symptoms of diabetes, many Americansan estimated 5.4 milliongo undiagnosed. For those who know they have diabetes, education on controlling it is the most important tool to maintaining a quality life. OMH has made a firm commitment to support and participate in the National Diabetes Education Programs (NDEP) first awareness campaign, Control Your Diabetes. For Life. In doing so, we are actively assisting this important public health program in its efforts to raise awareness of the importance of controlling diabetes and the benefits of proper treatment. The NDEP program is designing ways to promote early diagnosis of diabetes, improve the treatment and outcomes for people with diabetes, and ultimately, to prevent the onset of diabetes. It is teaching people with diabetes the importance of diet, physical activity and new medicines to achieve lower blood sugar levels. It is showing people how to get access to these treatment methods to ensure healthier lives. NDEPs awareness campaign is a milestone for public heath education, something that OMH has, and continues to place at the top of its list of goals. This is the first federal government program to work with public-private partners committed to raising awareness about diabetes. Together with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, OMH was able to use our cooperative agreements with the Association of American Acting OMH Director Named Indian Physicians, Association of Asian/Pacific Community Health Organizations, and the National Nathan Stinson, Jr., PhD, MD, MPH, was Council of LaRaza, to strengthen minority participaappointed Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for tion and help improve outcomes for people with Minority Health, effective February 1, 1999. diabetes.

Closing the Gap 4 February/March 1999  I   Diabetes Facts and Figures  Who Has Diabetes? By Jean Oxendine  O  f the 16 million Americans suffering from diabetes, about 5.4 million of these people do not know they have the disease. Each year, an additional 798,000 people are diagnosed with diabetes, and the number of people with diagnosed diabetes has risen from 1.5 million in 1958 to 10.6 million in 1998a sixfold increase. The majority of people who suffer from diabetes have type 2 diabetes, which accounts for 90 to 95 percent of all diagnosed cases of the disease. Diabetes affects men and women at equal rates, with 7.5 million men (8.2 percent of all men), and 8.1 million women (8.2 percent of all women) having the disease. Diabetes strikes all age groupsit is most prevalent in older Americans, with 6.3 million age 65 and older having diabetes (18.4 percent of this age group), and 15.6 million Americans age 20 and older having diabetes (8.2 percent of this age group). Minorities have particular reason to become aware and involved in NDEP and other diabetes education and treatment programs. Among  Your Comments, Please! The Office of Management and Budget is requesting your comments on its draft provisional guidance on the implementation of the revised federal standards for racial and ethnic data. This draft guidance--to be used for consistency and comparability--will help federal agencies determine how to present data collected using the revised standards for racial and ethnic data. Browse OMH-RC's Web site for details: http://www.omhrc.gov, or call toll free at 1-800-444-6472.  African Americans, 2.3 million people age 20 and older (10.8 percent) have diabetes. African Americans are 1.7 times as likely to have diabetes as Caucasians of similar age. Hispanic Americans are almost twice as likely to have diabetes as non-Hispanic whites of similar age. Both Mexican Americans and Puerto Ricans have higher rates of diabetes than nonHispanic whites. American Indians have the highest rates of diabetes in the world, ranging from 5 to 50 percent. Among the Pima Indians of Arizona, half of all the adults have type 2 diabetes. The data for diabetes among Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are limited, but we do know that some groups within this population are at increased risk for diabetes. Data collected from 1988 to 1995 show Native Hawaiians are twice as likely to have diagnosed diabetes as Caucasian residents of Hawaii. In 1995, diabetes contributed to 187,800 deaths, and was the seventh leading cause of death listed on U.S. death certificates (sixth leading cause of death by disease). Diabetes death rates vary considerably across racial and ethnic groups. Compared to nonHispanic whites, diabetes death rates were 2.5 times higher among African Americans, 2.4 times higher among American Indian/Alaska Natives (AI/ AN), and 1.7 times higher among persons of Hispanic origin. The complications from diabetes are numerous, affecting minorities at greater rates than non-minorities. According to NIDDK, African Americans experience higher rates of diabetes complications such as eye disease, kidney failure, and amputations, as compared to whites. The frequency of diabetic retinopathy is 40 percent to 50 percent higher in African Americans than in whites, 5  according to the National Center for Health Statistics. African Americans with diabetes experience end-stage renal disease about four times more often than whites with diabetes. And they are more likely to undergo lowerextremity amputations than whites with diabetes. According to the American Diabetes Association, in 1995, the rate of diabetic end stage renal disease among AI/ANs was six times higher than the general population with diabetes. More than half of lower limb amputations in the U.S. occurred among people with diabetes, and amputation rates among AI/ANs were significantly higher than the general population. Although studies dont universally agree, there is some evidence that suggests Mexican Americans have a higher incidence of microalbuminuriaan early indicator of diabetic nephropathythan nonHispanic whites. Other research shows Mexican Americans have higher rates of diabetic retinopathy than white Americans. Diabetes costs the United States about $98.2 billion annually, for total health care and related costs for treatment. Of this total, direct medical costs (e.g. hospitalization, medial care, treatment supplies) account for about $44.1 billion. The other $54.1 billion covers indirect costs such as disability payments, time lost from work, and premature death. As evidenced by these statistics, diabetes is a disease that affects everyone, regardless of age, race, or gender. The good news is that the NDEP campaign is making efforts to turn these numbers around.

Most of the individuals on the African American working group have been involved with the CDC and NIH, and all members either have diabetes or have a family member with diabetes, or are health care professionals. The African American working group is implementing media interventions in companion with community-based interventions, said Clark. The pilot sites will share their community intervention efforts through the mediaparticularly the African American media. We will look primarily at encouraging and promoting healthy eating, nutrition, and physical activity, said Clark. The efforts will focus on senior housing, community health centers, and churches, to start. We are using a variety of outlets to get the message across, said Clark. By using community and media interventions at the same time, this will keep the press informed and will help promote the message. Instead of starting something completely new, we are trying to see what happens in pilot sites when you incorporate the message into current programs, Clark said. American Indians/Alaska Natives According to Kelly Moore, MD, acting chief medical officer and area diabetes consultant for the Billings, Montana, area Indian Health Service, and American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) working group member, I was asked to become a member of the group by the chair of the group, Yvette Roubideux, MD, because I work with clients who have diabetes and I work with IHS, tribal, and urban diabetes programs based in Montana and Wyoming. The Association of American Indian Physicians (AAIP)of which Dr. Roubideaux is the president-elect began working with the National Diabetes Education Program in 1997 through the formation of a diabetes February/March 1999  committee. Several members of that committee now serve on the NDEP AI/AN work group. The AAIP Diabetes Committee conducted a series of focus groups to gather input from tribal leaders, Indian health professionals, and American Indian community members to guide the development of culturally appropriate diabetes education materials for NDEP. Currently, the AI/AN working group is developing a national PSA, and plan to release a message that will appeal to most AI/ANs. It is difficult to do this because we need to appeal to all Indians and there are many different tribes. The PSA must represent diversity, said Dr. Moore. The script, Dancers, and another television PSA, were focus group tested in the Dakotas. The Dancers was favored by the majority of the focus groups. It was felt to be culturally appropriate and motivating. Now the group is searching for a production company that is culturally sensitive and has experience with AI/ AN projects. The work group hopes to use an AI/AN production company, if possible. The recurrent theme in the PSA focus group testing and in the AAIP Diabetes Committee focus groups has been a return to traditional values. According to Dr. Moore, We want our audience to understand at least two underlying messages: that diabetes is threatening the future of our people but that there is hope. Dr. Moore said the AI/AN culture and traditions will only be preserved if the older generation assumes control of their diabetes. And, she said AI/AN people must learn that they do have a choice about their health. If they eat healthy, exercise and play an active role in other self care practices related to diabetes, they can make a difference. One difficulty with the AI/AN group is the number of different tribes that the PSA will attempt to reach. We wanted to show traditional 7  foods, but with so many different tribes, this was difficult, as food for each group might be different, said Dr. Moore. The PSAs will show corn, beans, and squashfoods that are traditional Indian foods for most of the groups. The scenes from the PSAs depict traditional weavers, drum players and storytelling to the children by elders, said Dr. Moore. There are also images of different people with diabetes practicing healthy behaviors while discussing how to control their diabetes. Hispanics/Latinos NDEP has developed Hispanic PSAs for television which are being aired in primetime on UNIVISIN. The campaign, Rayos y Truenos, has won an award of excellence from the Health Improvement Institute. Eliana Loveluck, chair of the NDEP Hispanic working group, got involved with NDEP when the National Coalition of Hispanic Health and Human Services Organizations (COSSMHO) was invited to the initial NDEP planning meeting. COSSMHO took special interest in becoming involved in NDEP due to the need for education about diabetes in Hispanic communities, and because of the work COSSMHO has conducted in the past on this particular disease, said Loveluck, project director for AIDS and Chronic Diseases at COSSMHO. Loveluck said the working group is involved in several projects to benefit Hispanics. Our role has been to advise NDEP with respect to Hispanic participation in NDEP, the development of the media and educational materials and campaign, and overall guidance for tailoring NDEPs work so that it is relevant to the needs of Hispanics in the United States, she added. Loveluck noted that NDEP has relied on representatives of minority ...continued on page 15 Closing the Gap   Controlling Your Diabetes  Easy Foot Test Just a LEAP Away By John West  e fish with it.

These states have high incidences of diabetes that result in lower extremity amputations, she said. Congress also funded pilot programs in conjunction with the Louisiana State University School of Medicine, the University of South Alabama, and the Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute for Rehabilitation, she added. Rolfsen said that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) statistics show that minorities are more at risk of diabetes and the complications that go with it such as blindness, kidney problems and hypertension. We need to stress an increase in the level of awareness about diabetes and its complications and make sure that people are aware of the existence of federal health centers, where anyone can be seen regardless of their ability-to-pay or status of citizenship, he said. The LEAP Program, the National Diabetes Education Program and its partners are charged with the responsibility of developing a national awareness coalition. The American Pharmaceutical Association has joined forces with the group and is spearheading a project to place a LEAP Filament into every diabetes medication prescription filled by every pharmacist in the country during the month of November 1999. We need to get people in leadership positions or provider roles to take advantage of every opportunity to get filaments and instructions on how to use them into the hands of individuals, Rolfsen said.

T  Closing the Gap  10  February/March 1999   Changes in Medicare  HCFA Keeps Public Informed on Medicare By John West  eople suffering from diabetes and eligible for Medicare coverage got a boost last year from the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA). Beginning July 1, 1998, Medicare expanded coverage to an estimated 4 million medicare beneficiaries with diabetes. The new benefits will now provide the skills and resources that most people need to control their diabetes. Many experts agree that early detection and management of the disease can lead to substantial reductions in life-threatening and serious illness. According to Ann Albright, MD, director of the California Diabetes Control Program and a member of the National Diabetes Education Program (NDEP) Steering Committee, the new regulation has made a significant difference for diabetes patients. Prior to Fiscal Year 1998, people with type 2 diabetes did not have Medicare coverage for a blood glucose meter and testing strips, Dr. Albright said. Now patients are able to get a blood glucose meter, lancets and, every three months, testing strips, provided particular steps are followed, she added. Testing strips, glucose meters and lancets are all available at most local drug stores. In order for Medicare to cover these benefits, a doctor must prescribe blood glucose testing supplies to the patient and document how often the patient needs to test on the prescription. Some Medicare policies may define how many test strips and lancets a patient is entitled to each month, Dr. Albright said. As always, physicians and diabetes educators can recommend the right supplies to buy, she added. Dr. Albright also pointed out that the new regulation change, covering  P  type 2 monitoring, is in its very early stages. No data has been collected yet on whether the availability of meters and strips has made a difference, Dr. Albright said. It is extremely likely that as more providers and beneficiaries learn about the benefits and patients begin to test their blood sugar, it should assist in improving the burden of diabetes, she added. HCFA officials agree that those patients who keep their blood glucose levels within the normal range reduce the risk of complications, such as blindness and amputations, that are often associated with uncontrolled diabetes. In the past, Medicare covered blood glucose monitors and testing strips only for type 1 patients. The new benefits will apply to people with either Medicare Part B or Medicare managed care coverage. Deductibles and co-pays for some Medicare policies may apply to these benefits officials said. Testing alone is not going to make significant changes, Dr. Albright said. The results of blood glucose tests need to be augmented with education to help patients learn to make lifestyle changes and cause the medical care system to intervene if blood glucose monitoring results are not improving, she added. For those who need help in learning how to monitor themselves, Medicare now covers a wider range of education and training programs to help teach patients to control their blood glucose levels. A physician must certify that a patient requires the training under a comprehensive plan of care. In the past, Medicare covered only education and training furnished by hospitalbased programs. Now, physicians and certain other physician practitioners, such as physician assistants, nurse  practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, nurse midwives, clinical psychologists and clinical social workers, can provide diabetes self-management and training services to their patients if their programs are recognized by the National Diabetes Advisory Board of the American Diabetes Association. The HCFA regulation covering diabetes education was recently published in the February 11, 1999, edition of the Federal Register as a Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM). Comments are due back to HCFA on or before April 12, 1999. NDEP and its partners are continually working with HCFA to inform beneficiaries on Medicare coverage and making it more accessible. HCFA also continues to define standards and implement programs to improve diabetes care. There are currently 23 quality improvement projects underway in the managed care plans with which HCFA is working to improve care for high risk patients. In an effort to understand and improve the quality of care for patients with diabetes, HCFA has conducted an eight-state pilot project in fee-for-service and managed care settings. The project has given HCFA an opportunity to identify and evaluate multiple strategies for improving care to people with diabetes. As for the future, Dr. Albright stressed the need for beneficiaries to stay informed. I urge individuals to learn as much as they can about the new benefits and take advantage of them, she said. More information on recent developments in Medicare, as well as a link to the Federal Register, can be obtained at HCFAs Web site: http:// www.hcfa.gov.

Titled the Diabetes Collaborative, the program involves 100 health centers and addresses the needs of nearly 65,000 underserved people diagnosed with diabetes. Partners in the effort include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI), NIH-supported diabetes research and training centers, and other public and private organizations, clinical networks and health centers. The Diabetes Collaborative is devoted to improving functional and clinical outcomes for those with diabetes. It aims to:  generate and document improving health outcomes regarding underserved populations;  convey knowledge on how to promote positive breakthrough changes; and  develop infrastructure, expertise, and leadership that will support improved health, access and cost outcomes. Learning by Doing Guided by a steering committee, the Collaborative is comprised of five lead cluster centers that act as mentors to the 100 participating sites. Each site strives to achieve four to five goals that specifically address the needs of its community. Collectively, all sites work to achieve at least 90 percent patient participation in treatment, which includes two HbA1c tests each year, at least three months apart. During the first phase of the collaborative, these sites work on implementing strategies for improving diabetes treatment as developed by the steering committee. Each month, health center teams report their progress toward their goals, and offer support through regular conference calls with cluster coordinators and faculty. Twice a year, the centers and sponsors attend learning sessions to address the latest findings among the clusters, and to share different strategies and breakthrough changes that will improve diabetes outcomes. Participants in these learning sessions include IHI, BPHC, CDC, Community Migrant Health, and HRSA regional cluster coordinators.

A study by the University of Miami Diabetes Research Institute found a new way to treat diabetes. The 23 study participants, who have type 1 diabetes, made medical history by being the first to be successfully infused with clusters of insulinproducing cells called islets. Previously, the islets were only available to patients who also required a lifesaving organ transplant.  Successful Weight Loss Treatment. The American Diabetes Association announced that in a clinical trial involving humans and the drug, leptin, weight loss was achieved. Findings also suggest that leptin, also called anti-obesity hormone, may also lower blood sugar levels. The trial showed obese diabetes patients lost an average of 16 pounds over six months.  Type 2 Diabetes Clinical Trials. These programs support large, multi-center clinical trials conducted under cooperative agreements or contracts with the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. One primary prevention trial is underway. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) is focused on testing lifestyle and pharmacological intervention strategies in people with impaired glucose tolerance who are at risk for developing type 2 diabetes. DPP is also focusing on how to prevent or delay the onset of this disease. The study, which takes place at 26 different sites, is looking at two lifestyle interventions, and metformina drug approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. DPP will complete recruitment in May, with a total of 3,000 participants in the study44.5 percent of which are minorities. More information about the study is available at: http:// www.niddk.nih.gov/patient/ dppbroch/dppbroch.htm. Roz Bullock Closing the Gap  O  f the approximately 16 million Americans who suffer from either type 1 or type 2 diabetes, all are at risk of developing sight-threatening eye diseases commonly associated with diabetes, according to the National Eye Institute (NEI). Though early detection and timely treatment can substantially reduce the risk of severe visual loss or blindness from diabetic eye disease, many people at risk are not having their eyes examined regularly to detect these problems before they impair vision. Increased awareness of the sightsaving benefits of annual eye examinations through dilated pupils is essential to reduce the significant social and personal costs of diabetic eye disease. There are three sight-threatening eye problems that people with diabetes may develop as a complication of the disease.  Diabetic retinopathywhich damages blood vessels in the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye that translates light into electrical impulses that the brain interprets as vision.  Cataractan opacity of the eyes crystalline lens that results in blurring of normal vision. People with diabetes are twice as likely to develop a cataract as someone who does not have the disease. In addition, cataracts tend to develop at an earlier age in people with diabetes.  Glaucomaoccurs when increased fluid pressure in the eye leads to progressive optic nerve damage. People with diabetes are nearly twice as likely to develop glaucoma as other adults. Diabetic retinopathy is the most common diabetic eye disease. About eight million peoplehalf of the nations estimated 16 million people  with diabeteshave at least early signs of diabetic retinopathy. Of this group, about 700,000 have serious retinal disease, with approximately 65,000 Americans progressing each year to proliferative retinopathythe diseases most sightthreatening stage. Annually, as many as 25,000 people go blind from the disorder, making it a leading cause of blindness among working Americans. For many people with diabetic retinopathy, there are no early symptoms. There is no pain, no blurred vision, and no ocular inflammation. In fact, many people do not develop any visual impairment until the disease has advanced well into its proliferative stage. At this point, vision cannot be restored. However, some people in the early and advanced stages of diabetic retinopathy may notice a change in their central and/or color vision. The loss of central vision results from macular edema, which can often be effectively treated. Because diabetic eye disease often has no early symptoms, it is detected during a comprehensive eye examination through dilated pupils. As part of its mission to address diabetic eye disease through biomedical research, disease prevention, and health promotion, NEI has established the National Eye Health Education Program (NEHEP). Coordinated by NEI and in partnership with various public and private organizations, NEHEP is focusing on public education programs that encourage early detection and timely treatment of diabetic eye disease and glaucomathe leading cause of blindness in African Americans over age 40.

Minority Outreach...from page 7  populations by involving them from the beginning and at every step of the process. There has been a genuine desire to incorporate diverse communities from the outset and this has worked very well, said Loveluck. However, all of the minority organizations that participate in this endeavor are asked to do so for other campaigns and health promotion efforts, she added. She also stressed that, although clearly invested in this effort, it has meant providing staff and resources that a majority of these organizations dont have. This in turn has placed an increased burden on these organizations to serve as technical advisors on cultural and linguistic competence for others. Loveluck said follow-up is an essential aspect of what needs to be stressed for the Hispanic component of NDEP. Because Hispanics have the lowest rates of health insurance and face numerous other obstacles in accessing health care services, NDEP must work in partnership with organizations that have the capacity to educate Hispanic communities and ensure follow-up on the information provided, said Loveluck. According to Loveluck, it is important to provide support and technologies to maintain behavior change, and to provide health care services in a culturally and linguistically competent manner. She said its not enough to simply educate someone about a particular disease or its risk factors, or steps to prevent the disease, if that individual cannot be referred to community mechanisms and organizations that can help. When planning and implementing the NDEP, Loveluck said, It is essential for NIH and CDC to know that the needs faced by our communities are vast, and the resources are not being adequately allocated for those very communities to take control of meeting their health and human services needs, said Loveluck.

TennCare Inpatient Admissions Due To Diabetes:   A Report of Regional and Managed Care Organization Variation Introduction Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder that has an adverse affect on the human body's insulin mechanism, resulting in the inability to properly digest and utilize carbohydrates in food. There are approximately eight million Americans who have been diagnosed as having diabetes and it is projected that there are another eight million who have the disease but are undiagnosed. Type I diabetes is known as juvenile onset diabetes and usually is diagnosed during the first two decades of life. It is estimated that 800,000 Americans suffer from Type I diabetes. Persons who have Type I diabetes must take insulin daily to live. Type II diabetes, sometimes known as adult onset diabetes, develops in adults over 40 years of age. Approximately 40 % of people with Type II diabetes also require insulin in varying amounts to control the disease. Over seven million Americans are diagnosed Type II diabetics. Based on 1990 - 1992 statistics, approximately 625,000 people are diagnosed with diabetes (Type I and II) each year. Diabetes is a very serious disease which can lead to many other medical complications, especially if left untreated. Diabetics are two to four times more likely to develop cardiovascular disease than people without diabetes. The risk of stroke is 2.5 times higher in diabetics. Diabetes is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease and of new cases of blindness among people 20 to 74 years of age. Sixty to seventy percent of diabetics have moderate to severe nerve damage. Diabetes is also the leading cause of new cases of blindness of adults 20 to 74 years of age. The average life expectancy of people with diabetes is 20 years less than people without diabetes. The U.S. government estimates that one out of every seven healthcare dollars is spent on diabetes or a complication of the disease.1 The primary treatment of diabetes is the control of blood glucose levels by way of glucose monitoring, exercise, and control of diet. Many patients require oral medications and/or insulin injections to maintain control of blood glucose levels. The treatment of diabetes is a continual process whereby the patient, the patient's family, and the patient's physician all play an important part in obtaining a positive outcome. Study Purpose This study of diabetes was conducted to help examine the quality of treatment being provided to the TennCare population suffering from diabetes. The study is based on the premise that a diabetic who is visiting and working together with his/her medical provider on a regular basis will have better control over the disease, resulting in fewer inpatient hospital admissions due to diabetes and complications resulting from this disease. 1  Facts provided by American Association of Diabetes Educators, American Diabetes Association, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International, and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the National Institutes of Health.  1    Method Data All data presented in this study were derived from TennCare eligibility and encounter data. Each managed care organization is required to provide the state with information concerning every service delivered to a TennCare recipient. This information is collected and stored in the form of encounter records. Comparisons of encounter data with corroborative sources demonstrate a high degree of validity and significant improvement over time in the quality of the encounter data reported by the MCOs to TennCare. This report measured hospitalizations for diabetic conditions which met the definition of ambulatory care sensitive (ACS). Ambulatory care sensitive conditions are conditions sensitive to management in the ambulatory care setting, given timely and appropriate primary care. Without such care, hospitalization may result. Data Definitions ACS diabetes is defined as being paid admissions to a hospital where the International Classification of Diseases - Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis code was 250.0 through 250.09, 250.1 through 250.19, 250.2 through 250.29, 250.3 through 250.39, 250.8 through 250.89, or 250.9 - 250.99. Calculation of Rates Population counts are not as meaningful for calculating rates when reporting on a Medicaid or Medicaid type population because members tend to move in and out of eligibility. A rate using member years has proven to be more appropriate when analyzing this type of data and, therefore, was used in calculating rates in this report. Member years were calculated by dividing the total number of eligible days for all members of the defined population by 365 (366 for the year of 1996 which was a leap year). The crude rate was then computed by dividing the number of admissions for the respective population by the number of member years to yield the number of admissions per member year. Rates presented in this report are admissions per 1000 member years (calculated crude rate multiplied by 1000). Crude rates were adjusted for the demographic variation in age and sex between reported populations. Analysis Yearly age and sex adjusted rates of inpatient admissions due to diabetes per 1000 member years were calculated and compared. Overall rates for the 1995 and 1996 TennCare population are presented along with the 1993 Tennessee Medicaid population rate as a pre-TennCare reference. TennCare results were also broken down to show rates by MCO and community service area (CSA). Calculated rates are displayed in the following table and charts. Rates for 1995 and 1996 are based on all TennCare members  2    age 35 to 64. The 1993 Tennessee Medicaid rate was based on the Medicaid population age 36 to 64. The Medicaid program data used slightly different age groupings than those of TennCare, accounting for the slight difference in age. This difference should not cause any problems in using the 1993 value as a reference point in making comparisons. Data represented in the charts are also presented in table format in Appendix A. Results Table 1 shows that inpatient admissions due to diabetes per 1000 member years have dropped in each successive year displayed.  Table 1  Inpatient Admissions Due to Diabetes Per 1000 Member Years   1993 Medicaid  1995 TennCare  1996 TennCare  Diabetes Inpatient Admissions Per 1000 Member Years  4.96  2.83  2.63  Chart 1 shows inpatient admission rates by MCO. Nine of the twelve MCOs show a decrease in the rate of inpatient admissions due to diabetes. Only Omni, PHP, and Tennsource displayed an increase when comparing 1996 to 1995. TLC had the second highest rate in 1995 (4.56 admissions per 1000 member years) and the highest rate in 1996 (3.96 admissions per 1000 member years). THP had the highest rate in 1995 (4.65 admissions per 1000 member years) and the second lowest rate in 1996 (1.55 admissions per 1000 member years). Phoenix, at 1.44 admissions per 1000 member years, had the lowest rate in 1996. All 1995 and 1996 MCO yearly results were below the 1993 Medicaid rate of 4.96 admissions per 1000 member years. Chart 2 shows inpatient admission rates by CSA. Ten of Tennessee's twelve CSAs showed a decrease in 1996 from 1995 results. The South Central and Shelby CSAs displayed an increase in admission rate in 1996 from 1995 values. The Upper Cumberland CSA showed the highest rate for 1995 (4.30 admissions per 1000 member Chart 1  Diabetes Inpatient Admissions Per 1000 Member Years  by Managed Care Organization   3    Admissions / 1000 Member Yrs  5 4 3 2 1 JDeere TSource Phoenix Prudent Access TCare BCBS HNet TLC Omni PHP THP VHP Shelby  0  MCO  1995  1996  1993 TN Medicaid  Chart 2  Diabetes Inpatient Admissions Per 1000 Member Years  by Community Service Area   Admissions / 1000 Member Yrs  5 4 3 2 1 TCare UCum SCent David MCum Hamil Knox East NW SW NE SE  0  Community Service Area  1995  1996  1993 TN Medicaid  years) and the 1000 member 1996.

The Knox CSA had the lowest admission rate for both 1995 and all yearly rates were below the 1993 Medicaid rate of 4.96 admissions per years.  4    Discussion This report reviewed trends in hospital admissions for diabetes under the TennCare program. This measure is felt to be an indicator of performance in the delivery of preventive services and effective outpatient care. Significant improvement was noted from 1993 under the traditional fee for service Medicaid program to 1995 under TennCare, a managed care delivery delivery system. Additional improvement was noted from 1995 to 1996. Age and sex have been taken into account in this comparison of rates. However, other demographic factors and characteristics unique to a specific population could be contributing to the differences in rates between MCOs and CSAs. Specifically, it is important to note that higher or lower rates for an individual MCO or CSA may be due to that MCO or CSA having a disproportionate number of adults with diabetes. The rates presented represent the admission rate with respect to the entire TennCare population ages 35 to 64, not just those with the diagnosis of diabetes. Further analysis will be required to determine this potential impact.

Diabetes                can be associated with serious complications and premature death, but people with                diabetes can take steps to control the disease and lower the risk of complications.                                           Definition                                           Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce or properly use insulin,                a hormone that is needed to convert sugar, starches and other food into energy                needed for daily life.  The cause of diabetes is a mystery, although both genetics                and environmental factors such as obesity and lack of exercise appear to play roles.                There are two major types of diabetes:                                                              Type 1.   An auto-immune disease in which the body does not                  produce any insulin, most often occurring in children and young adults.  Type                  1 diabetes was previously called insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) or                  juvenile-onset diabetes.  Type 1 diabetes develops when the body's immune system                  destroys pancreatic beta cells, the only cells in the body that make the hormone                  insulin that regulates blood glucose.  This form of diabetes usually strikes                  children and young adults, who need several insulin injections a day or an                  insulin pump to survive.  Type 1 diabetes may account for 5% to 10% of all                  diagnosed cases of diabetes.  Risk factors for type 1 diabetes include autoimmune,                  genetic, and environmental factors.                                     Who is at greater risk for type 1 diabetes?                                                                      Siblings of people with type 1 diabetes                                                       Children of parents with type 1 diabetes                                                                                                    Type 2.   A metabolic disorder resulting from the body's inability                  to make enough, or properly use, insulin.  It is the most common form of the disease.                   Type 2 diabetes is nearing epidemic proportions, due to an increased number of older                  Americans, and a greater prevalence of obesity and sedentary lifestyles. Type 2 diabetes                  was previously called non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) or adult-onset                  diabetes.  Type 2 diabetes may account for about 90% to 95% of all diagnosed cases of                  diabetes.  It usually begins as insulin resistance, a disorder in which the cells do                  not use insulin properly.  As the need for insulin rises, the pancreas gradually loses                  its ability to produce insulin.  Type 2 diabetes is associated with older age, obesity,                  family history of diabetes, prior history of gestational diabetes, impaired glucose                  tolerance, physical inactivity, and race/ethnicity.  African Americans, Hispanic/Latino                  Americans, Native Americans, and some Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are at                  particularly high risk for type 2 diabetes.  Type 2 diabetes is increasingly being                  diagnosed in children and adolescents.                                     Who is at greater risk for type 2 diabetes?                                                            People over age 45                                                             People with a family history of diabetes                                                             People who are overweight                                                             People who do not exercise regularly                                                             People with low HDL cholesterol or high triglycerides                                                             Certain racial and ethnic groups (e.g., African Americans, Latinos, Asian &                      Pacific Islanders, and Native Americans)                                                             Women who had gestational diabetes, a form of diabetes occurring in 2-5% of all                      pregnancies, or who have had a baby weighing 9 pounds or more at birth                                                                          Type 2 diabetes is more common among these ethnic groups:                                                             African Americans.   African Americans are 1.7 times as likely                      to have type 2 diabetes as the general population.  An estimated 2.3 million                      African Americans, or 10.8%, have diabetes.                                                              Latinos.   Latinos are almost twice as likely to have type 2                      diabetes. For example, diabetes affects 1.2 million or 10.6% of the Mexican                      American population.                                                              Native Americans.   Overall prevalence of type 2 diabetes in                      Native Americans is 12.2% vs. 5.2% of the general population. In some tribes,                      50% of the population has diabetes.                                                                                                          Gestational diabetes  develops in 2 -5% of all pregnancies but                  disappears when a pregnancy is over. Gestational diabetes is a form of glucose                  intolerance that is diagnosed in some women during pregnancy.  Gestational diabetes                  occurs more frequently among African Americans, Hispanic/Latino Americans, and                  Native Americans.  It is also more common among obese women and women with a family                  history of diabetes.  During pregnancy, gestational diabetes requires treatment to                  normalize maternal blood glucose levels to avoid complications in the infant.  After                  pregnancy, 5% to 10% of women with gestational diabetes are found to have type 2                  diabetes.  Women who have had gestational diabetes have a 20% to 50% chance of                  developing diabetes in the next 5-10 years.                                                  Other specific types  of diabetes result from specific genetic                  conditions (such as maturity onset diabetes of youth), surgery, drugs, malnutrition,                  infections, and other illnesses.  Such types of diabetes may account for 1% to 5% of                  all diagnosed cases of diabetes.

Treatment of diabetes                                                             In order to survive, people with type 1 diabetes must have insulin delivered by a pump or injections.                                                 Many people with type 2 diabetes can control their blood glucose by following                  a careful diet and exercise program, losing excess weight, and taking oral medication.                                                 Many people with diabetes also need to take medications to control their cholesterol and blood pressure.                                                 Among adults with diagnosed diabetes, about 11% take both insulin and oral medications,                  22% take insulin only, 49% take oral medications only, and 17% do not take either insulin or oral medications.                                                           Impaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glucose                                                             Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) are considered to                  be prediabetic conditions, and studies suggest that they may be reversible.                                                 IGT is a condition in which the blood sugar level is elevated (between 140 and 199                  milligrams per deciliter or mg/dL in a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test), but not high                  enough to be classified as diabetes.                                                  IFG is a condition in which the fasting blood sugar level is elevated (between 110 and 125                  mg/dL after an overnight fast) but is not high enough to be classified as diabetes.                                                 Among U.S. adults 40-74 years of age, 16.0 million (15.6%) have IGT and 10.0 million (9.7%) have IFG.

MAYS: I'd like to officially welcome everyone, and welcome those of you who are out there on the Internet listening. This is a hearing that is being held by the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics, by the Subcommittee on Populations.   Let me talk a little bit about the purpose of today's hearing, and then we will start with some introductions. The National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics, particularly its Subcommittee on Populations, has a charge. Part of its charge is to work in an advisory capacity to the Secretary of Health and Human Services on data.   One of the issues that we have been concerned with is, since the 1997 OMB directive, whether or not the collection of data on race and ethnicity is moving along as planned, and whether it is working sufficiently for all groups equally.   The other issues that we have been concerned with are those of disparities, in terms of whether or not we are collecting data for vulnerable populations such as racial and ethnic minority on health disparities, and what would be the data to collect beyond that of race and ethnicity. So we have often in our hearings taken testimony on what are the variables in the particular groups would be important for us to have data on.    Of course, what has emerged in many of our hearings has been things like social economic status, the capacity to be able to geo code data. For some groups, what we have heard is that there is such a paucity of data, the ability to be able to have data in sufficient numbers, so that we can actually look and determine if there are health disparities in some subpopulations, is also critical.   So this is a hearing in which we began in May in Los Angeles, hearing from the population of Asian, Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders. We took the opportunity, because we are here prior to the American Public Health Association meetings, to continue the hearing because of the diversity that exists in this particular population. This gives us an opportunity to be here in San Francisco, where there are a number of experts, where many people are involved in debating and analyzing the issues that surround the measurement of race and ethnicity, as well as some innovative programming in the San Francisco area in the collection of data for some of the small populations that exist within the Asian, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islanders.    So this seems like a -- as much as I am from L.A., I have to admit, this is a great place to be, here in San Francisco. Given what I left, it is wonderful to be here today and not in gloomy Los Angeles.   What I am going to do is start with introductions, and then after the introductions, I will share for the purposes of those of you on the Internet what the actual hearing questions are. We designed a set of questions that by the end of the hearing we hope that we have gathered testimony to help give us some insight into some of these issues.   So why don't we start with introductions? Eugene.   DR. LENGERICH: I'm Gene Lengerich from Penn State University, member of the subcommittee.   MR. HITCHCOCK: Good morning. I'm Dale Hitchcock, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation in HHS. I am staff to the subcommittee.     DR. STEINWACHS: I'm Don Steinwachs, Johns Hopkins University, member of the committee.   MR. LOCALIO: I'm Russell Localio, University of Pennsylvania, member of the committee.   DR. HUNGATE: Bob Hungate, Physician Patient Partnerships for Health and member of the committee.   DR. BREEN: Nancy Breen. I am an economist specializing in health disparities at the National Cancer Institute, and I am staff to the committee.   MS. BURWELL: Audrey Burwell, from the Office of Minority Health and co-lead staff for the subcommittee.   DR. YU: I'm Elena Yu, professor of epidemiology at San Diego State University and a dumb student at Johns Hopkins University.   MS. PEREZ: I'm Christina Perez, regional minority health consultant in Region 9, and also here for Dr. Ronald Banks, the regional health administrator.   DR. MURRAY: I'm Carol Murray. I'm here from the University of Hawaii Social Science Research Institute.   MS. SORENSEN: Catherine Sorensen, Hawaii State Department of Health. I'm with the informatics project and also representing the Office of Health Equity.    MS. SAGATELIAN: Margo Sagatelian with the Office for Civil Rights in Region 9, Health and Human Services.   MR. SOGOLARA: Randy Sogolara, Asian and Pacific Islander Bay Area Health Council. It is a new startup. It is one year in its inception, so I am here to basically get more information.   MS. LOW: My name is Debbie Low. I'm with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency here in San Francisco, and I am in the environmental justice program.     MS. WHITE: Gracie White, NCVHS, staff to the subcommittee.   MS. WILHIDE: Sheryl Wilhide, Magna Systems Incorporated.   Agenda Item: Overview of Subcommittee on Populations, Purpose of Hearing and Review of Agenda - Vicki Mays   DR. MAYS: For those of you on the Internet, one of the things that we have done is, we have a call-in number. So after the presentations, there is time for questions and answers, so there is a number that if you have a question for one of the presenters, you can feel free to call.   We have done this in particular to make sure, given the geographic diversity that exists in terms of covering this population, that people who are in other areas can feel free to participate. It may be a little bit early in some areas in terms of time, and it may be later in others, those of you in Hawaii are probably very decimated if you are calling in this morning, but we still wanted to make sure that there was the ability to be able to do that. So I'm going to try to remember a couple of times to repeat the numbers, so that you can feel free to repeat this option.   If you would like to call in with a question, the phone number is 877-939-8305. You will have to know the host number, which is 288088. So the host is 288088, and then you need a participant number. The participant number is 278561. So the participant number is 278561, and the call-in number is 877-939-8305.   This is a series of questions that by the end of our hearing we want to try and have some insight to. So we have shared these with some of our speakers. Each speaker will address these in different ways. No one speaker is expected to, and we know they can't answer all of these questions, so by the conclusion of this hearing we hope to have insight on these questions.   Part of our questions are for Pacific Islander populations. What techniques are used to collect data on race and ethnicity? How does language, population size or population geography impact the ability to gather data on the health status, health behaviors and health experiences of these populations? What recommendations could you make to DHHS for addressing these issues?   Next. Do you believe that there is a significant problem of misclassification of racial and ethnic categories in existing data sets? For which data sets? For which categories? What steps such as possible partnerships with advocacy groups are in place for studying the issues and for making corrections?   Is data collected on ethnicity, language spoken and national origin in ongoing surveillance data sets? On what data sets are these collected, and if you have examples, please share them. What barriers exist to data collection analysis and disease surveillance for eliminating health disparities in Asian, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander populations? Describe strategies that DHHS could use to remove those barriers.   Current data collection methods emphasize the protection of the privacy and confidentiality of survey respondents, which requires a certain number of responses in order to report the data. Given these considerations as applied to small population, what number of responses would you feel are too low to report?   What are some strategies that DHHS could use to increase the capacity for Asian, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islanders researchers and organizations to conduct health disparities research, demonstration projects and evaluation of data? Please describe strategies that DHHS could use to support relationships between and among universities, academic researchers, community, state and local health entities. Are there any accountability mechanisms you recommend that DHHS could institute to insure the development and maturation of these partnership relationships, and how could DHHS support partnerships with the Asian, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander communities to improve safety and quality in health care?   Finally, do the guidelines on race and ethnicity collection from OMH have adequate utility for the Asian, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander populations, or is there a need to collect information using other expanded categories.   So that kind of gives you a sense broadly of what will be discussed by some of the speakers, as well as the areas that the committee is currently interested in receiving testimony on.   So without further ado, we are actually going to get started with Christina Perez, who is the regional minority health coordinator for Region 9. She is also here on behalf of Ron Banks, to offer welcome. Ron Banks is the regional HHS health administrator for Region 9.   Christina, welcome, and thank you for being here.   Agenda Item: Overview of Pacific Island Health Data Issues - Christina Perez   MS. PEREZ: Thank you, Vickie. Good morning, everyone. On behalf of Dr. Banks, who unfortunately could not be here today because he is in Washington, D.C., we want to welcome you to Region 9, and especially to our listening audience and the audience here in the room, we appreciate the time and sacrifice that you have made to come to be at this important meeting.   Dr. Banks had asked me to share with the subcommittee some current and recent data projects that we have undertaken in Region 9. But before I do that, I want to give you a visual snapshot of some of the characteristics of Region 9.   For those of you in the listening audience, the first slide is a slide of the regional population in Region 9. Included in this slide is the population for California, Arizona, Nevada, Hawaii, Guam, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Republic of Palau. The most populated area in this region is California, with 34,501,130 people, and the least populated is the Republic of Palau, with 19,717.   This next slide is a slide that represents the Asian, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander populations in the states of Arizona, California, Hawaii and Nevada. According to the recent census, Nevada was the state in the whole country who increased in size overall. But if you look at the Asian, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander populations for Arizona, you see that the population for Asians is 1.8 percent, for Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islanders is 0.1 percent. In California the Asian population is close to 11 percent and the Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islanders populations is .03.    In Hawaii, the Asian population is about 41.6 percent of the population, and the Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islanders populations is 9.4. In Nevada, the Asian population is 4.5 percent and Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islanders population is 0.4.   This particular slide just demonstrates the major regional, racial and ethnic groups in Region 9. In American Samoa, there is Samoan and Tongan. In Arizona and California, Hawaii and Nevada we have the Asian, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islanders, black, Hispanic and Native American. In the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, there are Carolinians, Chamorro, Micronesians, Caucasians, Chinese, Japanese and Korean. In the Federated States of Micronesia, it is primarily Micronesian and Polynesian. In Guam it is Chamorro, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese and Korean, and in the Republic of the Marshall Islands and Republic of Palau, it is both Micronesian.   This particular slide, which is a little bit busy, is really a slide to demonstrate the number of different languages spoken, specifically in the Pacific Basin. This does not include also over 100 other languages that are spoken by Asian populations throughout this region, so I won't go through all of them. But just to mention that in Palau, for example, the languages are English and Palaun, the official language. In Sunsorolo the language are Sonosorole and English. In Tobi, the languages are Tobi and English, and Anwar, Japanese and English, depending on the state. But if you look at the Federated States of Micronesia, English is the official language, but we also have (foreign phrase).   If we look at the Department of Health and Human Services map which is typically depicted, we see that Region 9 usually just shows the states of California, Nevada, Hawaii and Arizona. But if we superimpose a map of Oceana and the Pacific Islands which has the remaining portion of Region 9, you see that the span and the breadth of the area that is Region 9 covers the area from about -- for those of you who cannot see this, Hawaiian Islands would be pictured up around Maine, and then you have American Samoa around Florida. You would have the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia cutting through the central middle states of the United States. The Northern Mariana Islands would sit somewhere in the neighborhood of Idaho, and then Guam would be around the border of Oregon and California. Then Yap and Palau would be sitting out in the Pacific Ocean. So you can see that this is a large, large area, which in and of itself creates a number of barriers.   Just for your point of information, the air miles from San Francisco, the least amount of travel for us in Region 9, that is, the shortest distance for us to travel would be to Sacramento, California, which is only 100 miles. Then the furthest would be to Republic of Palau, which is 8,627. The numbers are large or small in between, as you can see.   In terms of communication, I am going to start from the bottom of this slide to make the point. That is, if it is 12 noon on Monday in Washington, D.C., it is two a.m. on Tuesday in Palau, and three a.m. on Tuesday in CNMI, Guam, Chuuk and Yap, and it is four a.m. on Tuesday in Ponopay, and five a.m. on Tuesday in the Marshall Islands, six a.m. on Monday in American Samoa, seven a.m. on Monday in Hawaii, and nine a.m. on Monday in California, Arizona and Nevada.     Of all of the statistical information that I was wanting to put in this presentation, I think the most remarkable and stunning and incredible is that of the infant mortality rate specifically in the Pacific Islands. The Federated States of Micronesia, according to data that I got from the Central Intelligence Agency World Fact Book for 2003 is 32.9 deaths per 1,000 live births. In the Marshall Islands, the infant mortality rate is 31.58 deaths per 1,000 live births. In Palau, the infant mortality rate is 15.76 deaths per 1,000 live births. In American Samoa, the infant mortality rate is 9.82 deaths per 1,000 live births. In Guam, it is 6.64 deaths per 1,000 live births, which is below the national average, and also, in CNMI, 5.52 deaths per 1,000 live births.   If we look at some of the morbidity and mortality data for our Asian, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islanders, we see that Vietnamese women have a cervical cancer incidence rate five times higher than white women. Vietnamese men have the highest rates of liver cancer for all racial and ethnic groups. Native Hawaiians have the highest breast cancer mortality rate in the nation. Native Hawaiian males, mortality rates for all cancers has increased 62 percent between 1976 and 1990. Marshallese Island females have higher breast and cervical cancer rates compared to overall U.S. rates, and Asian, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander women are the least racial and ethnic group to get mammograms.   In addition, Asian Americans are disproportionately impacted by liver cancer, which is usually caused by exposure to hepatitis-B virus, and heart disease still is a leading cause of death.   In addition to the kinds of issues that we look at here in the continental U.S. that impact health disparities, what is different in the Pacific Island -- and I am focusing on the Pacific Island because of disparities, and the differences are so different compared to the continental U.S., that is, inadequate supplies of potable water, inadequate facilities of disposal of waste, threats to marine ecosystem, over fishing or illegal fishing practices, and then a high unemployment rate. In the Marshall Islands, there is a 30 percent unemployment rate. That is again from statistics from the CIA World Fact Book 2003. In Guam the unemployment rate is 15 percent, in FSM, 16. In the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, 33 percent of the workers there are foreign workers. Of the available work force, which is just a little over 6,000 people in CNMI, 2,000 are working. That gives you an idea of the impact of the immigrant population in the CNMI, and what they are dealing with in terms of also of the health care needs of that particular population. In American Samoa, the unemployment rate is 15 percent.   That completes that portion of the overview.   The next part is to share with yu some of the data projects that we are working on in Region 9. They have recently or currently been under way, so not all of them are -- some of them are in different phases of their work.   The projects have as an overall goal the promotion of increased participation of the Asian, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander populations in federal policy development, as well as increased participation in regionally funded activities within the related programmatic priorities of the regional health administrator, the Office of Women's Health, the Office of Population Affairs and the Office of Minority Health.   Lastly, the data activities promote closing the health data gap through fostering research and the collection of data for Asian, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islanders.   The first project I want to describe is a project that is a collaboration of the regional Office of Population Affairs and the regional health administrator. This project is a funded research study with the University of Hawaii School of Social Work, that assesses the perceived barriers to prenatal care access among Asian and Pacific Islander immigrant women in Hawaii, specifically Chinese, Vietnamese, Filipino and Samoan immigrants are the target populations for the study. The goal of the study is to identify barriers to care from the clients, the provider and the policy maker's perspectives.   A second project is the OMH state partnership initiative which is funded by the Office of Minority Health, Department of Health and Human Services, the central office. This initiative was established in federal fiscal year 1999 to assist state minority health entities to develop or expand their existing infrastructure, or to address the public health needs of racial and ethnic minorities in their states, or to undertake special projects to address emerging health related issues impacting minority communities.   One project was a California Department of Health services, Office of Multicultural Health, to assess the culture and linguistic capacity of the Department's work force to meet the diverse needs of the population.   The second phase of this project is developing and evaluating a train and trainer module for developing a cadre of public health, department staff, contractors and subcontractors on critical issues in cultural and linguistic competency in health care delivery, is in progress. The state department initiative contract was also awarded to the Hawaii State Department of Health Office of Health Equity to develop a document that would serve as an introduction to the availability of national and local data related to minority health. The name of the document is Minority Health Data Enhancement Project.     A separate and current contract with the Office of Health Equity is to assess the health promotion activities of faith based organizations. This project will conduct an evaluation of existing faith based programs in Hawaii to determine if they have contributed to changes in health behaviors of the participants, and to determine if successful projects can be adapted for broader use.   Lastly, the Arizona Department of Health Services Office of Local and Minority Health was contracted under the state partnership initiative to assess the health care needs of Asian American and Pacific Islander populations.   Another project funded by the divisional Office of Minority Health is currently contracting with the Association of Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations or APCHO, to develop a strategic plan and curriculum to implement a geographic information systems technical assistance and training module tailored to the data needs of Asian, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islanders. APCHO will pilot the training module with some of its affiliates on the continental U.S., and also the Pacific Basin.   In addition, the regional Office of Minority Health is contracting with the California Pan Ethnic Health Network to convene a statewide meeting for communities of color on the assessment, collection, analysis and dissemination of data. The convening will enable the participants to share information on how to collect and use available demographic data that can lead to demonstrating improved health outcomes and to identify areas of data collection that still need to be standardized.   In Portland, Oregon in March, 2002, Office of Minority Health regions eight, nine and ten held a tri-regional data workshop, collecting, using, disseminating health data on minority populations. This workshop was a collaborative effort of the U.S. Office of Public Health and Science, Office of Minority Health and regions eight, nine and ten, and the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality program.   The purpose of the workshop was intended to assist representatives of minority community-based organizations, researchers, state and local health officials understand the issues related to the collection, use and dissemination of health data on minority populations, and to develop strategies to address these issues. Asian, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islanders were active participants as workshop planners, panelists, researchers and community representatives from the three regions.   The last project I want to report on is that on October 2002, the Office of Women's Health, Department of Health and Human Services announced the development of a new database to provide state and local public health agencies, faith based and community-based organizations, and health advocates with reliable comparative data.    It is expected that with the database, these groups will be able to one, monitor health status changes, also develop grant proposals and perform other program and policy related tasks. The database relies on existing national data available at the state and county levels. The national database will be available on CD-ROM and the Office of Women's Health website, and a training schedule for Region 9 is currently being planned.   Lastly, I would be remiss if I did not mention the recent defeat of Proposition 54, formerly known as classification by race, ethnicity, color or national origin, and informally known as the racial privacy initiative. The initiative would have broadly affected many aspects of state and local government by restricting the collection of data or classification of individuals by race and ethnicity.   While the initiative language was brief and had several exemption categories, these were not defined in sufficient detail to determine if certain activities and data sources would be interpreted as exempt. So the outcome if implemented was unclear. Had the proposition passed, I think that we would have additional hearing questions to ponder at this meeting today.   I want to thank you very much for the opportunity to represent the region, and I'll be glad to answer any questions anyone might have.   DR. MAYS: Thank you for your presentation. It is exactly what we needed to start getting a very good sense of the diversity of the groups that exist in the region, as well as some sense of what their health issues are, and the impressive number of programs that you all currently have under way in this region. So I'm sure this will be a very beneficial presentation for us.   Let's open it up for questions. We will start with committee members, and then we will move to the audience.    DR. STEINWACHS: I found what you presented very interesting and useful. You educated me in one area, too. I hadn't realized the CIA put out a world data book, and now I'm going to try to get access to it.   MS. PEREZ: The library.   DR. STEINWACHS: Any library will do? But it did raise in my mind the question of the data sources that you have to rely on in the region in order to understand and describe the health of the populations that you have responsibility for. Could you say something about the issue of access to data for many of the smaller islands and territories?    It is very interesting that you needed to go to the CIA data book, which may be the best. I was wondering whether there were data issues particularly for the region.   MS. PEREZ: A tremendous number of data issues, as you can imagine. We go by what is available. The CIA fact book is actually really helpful, because it covers just about everything you want to know to a degree.    It does not cover health disparities information, and it does not go into too much information on subpopulations, which is for us, both on the continental U.S. and out in the Pacific Basin a big issue.   It is always a challenge for us to get information, to get accurate information. So we use actually a lot of information from our community partners. We hope that we can collectively develop some sort of way to really capture more of that data, but at the moment we really just pull together whatever is out there. It is much easier with all of the information that is available by states, the continental United States, but are much more difficult in the Pacific.   DR. STEINWACHS: Thank you.   MR. HITCHCOCK: Christina, that was great. That was just what we wanted, and yu did a very good job.   MS. PEREZ: Thank you.   MR. HITCHCOCK: An earlier version of this subcommittee did a report on the data needs of the Pacific ancillary areas. We relied in part on the CIA yearbook as well.   There was another document that we relied on a bit that I thought was quite interesting. I don't know if it is still around or not. That was the Department of the Interior's state of the Islands, annual report on the Islands. Are they still doing that?   MS. PEREZ: Yes. Actually we have the most recent document, which is 1999. It gives some of the details around the health issues, but again, the amount of detail is limited.    MR. HITCHCOCK: It has something of politics and industries and occupations and that sort of thing, as I remember.   MS. PEREZ: Well, actually, the best way to really get a realistic picture is to travel to the islands in the Pacific. That is the way to really begin to understand the degree of depravity of information that is available to them also, as well as to us.   MR. HITCHCOCK: Do you have the opportunity to travel much? Does your office actually go out to the Islands?   MS. PEREZ: It depends on funding.   MR. HITCHCOCK: For us in Washington, it is almost like international travel if we were go to go the Islands.   MS. PEREZ: Well, it is international travel actually. You cross the International Date Line.   DR. STEINWACHS: I wanted to support that there were committee members that wanted to hold these hearings in places that were out in the Pacific, but we had some funding problems.   MS. PEREZ: Well, if it were at all possible, I certainly would encourage that, because that really is the best way to get a true picture and to feel what it is like to live there or at least walk around there, talk to the people, talk to the folks working in the health departments, and to really understand what they are dealing with.   DR. MAYS: Russell.   MR. LOCALIO: Thank you for joining us. I am Russell Localio, committee member.   I have two lines of questions. I don't really know where they are going, because I don't know the answer.   MS. PEREZ: Just so long as they are not data wonk questions, because I'm not a data person.   DR. MAYS: He is a statistician.   MS. PEREZ: I just wanted to let you know ahead of time.   MR. LOCALIO: I want to give a couple of examples. You put up a slide, I believe, that talked about Vietnamese men. That was one of the examples.   MS. PEREZ: What?   MR. LOCALIO: Vietnamese men.   MS. PEREZ: Oh, yes.   MR. LOCALIO: It would be interesting to know, for example, what is the rate of liver cancer among Vietnamese men living in the continental United States for those men who were born in Vietnam, versus the rates of liver cancer of Vietnamese men who are Vietnamese born of Vietnamese parents in this country, and who has lived his entire life in this country. What types of data do you have available that could distinguish those two cases?   MS. PEREZ: Actually, I don't have at my fingertips any of that data, but I think I would probably first go to Stanford University, where they have a -- we actually worked with them, Dr. Low, I believe, is his last name, to work on their hepatitis-B prevention campaign. That might be a start for us. That is, I would go there first to see what he and his staff might have on that.   MR. LOCALIO: So in other words, you would have to rely on a private researcher's data to get information to answer a question, for example --   MS. PEREZ: Definitely.   MR. LOCALIO: -- as to whether the high rate of liver cancer is related to some genetic predisposition among Vietnamese for liver cancer, or whether it is environmental, based on some exposure that Vietnamese men had in Vietnam, for example, is that correct?   MS. PEREZ: That is correct. I also would like to add that having looked through the Healthy U.S. 2003 book to try to find that kind of data there, I haven't read it inch by inch, page by page, but it is not there, I couldn't find it. That is where I think that I might look for it.   MR. LOCALIO: I think you could expand that question to any subgroup that we are talking about here, in terms of where they are currently living, and whatever health statistic you are talking about, isn't that correct? You couldn't do that any better for Samoans who have lived in Samoa versus Samoans who live in San Francisco, isn't that correct?   MS. PEREZ: I think that is correct. I am trying to remember the California health information survey data questions to see if they would have that specific kind of information. But at the moment I think I would still have difficulty getting that information. I could be able to tell you that in California, for example, we probably have the largest community of Latinos from Sacadecas, and the largest community of Samoans in Southern California. I could tell you things like that, but I wouldn't necessarily be able to tell you about the health issues in the subpopulations.   MR. LOCALIO: I just wanted to mention that, because it is well known, for example, that there are more people of Polish descent living in the Toledo area, for example, than are living in big cities in Poland. I think we have to understand that that is a difference.   The other point you brought up that I need clarification on is, you mentioned some source of data where people could get access to information at the county level. I'm not sure, the slide went up a little fast for me and I wasn't able to -- you said something about giving people access to data at the county level?   MS. PEREZ: Yes, I think you are referring to the Office of Women's Health data project, where they use county and state data to make available to communities who want to better understand how to utilize that data. I think that might be what you are referring to, is that the one?   MR. LOCALIO: But that involves only women, is that correct?   MS. PEREZ: Yes.   MR. LOCALIO: So if you wanted to get a general picture of the health or health status of people at the county level in Region 9, what would you do?   MS. PEREZ: I would probably spend about a month trying to piece together as much information as I could.   MR. LOCALIO: A month. Okay, thank you.   MS. PEREZ: I mean, full time.   MR. LOCALIO: I'm not surprised at all. Thank you very much.   MS. PEREZ: But I think we could come up with some figures, but I think still they wouldn't be, I don't think, the most -- not necessarily the most accurate, but they would just give you a snapshot.   MR. LOCALIO: Thank you very much.   MS. PEREZ: You're welcome. I hope I answered those questions.   MR. LOCALIO: Yes, thank you.   DR. MAYS: Nancy, then Audrey.   DR. BREEN: Thank you very much for a very helpful presentation. I hope you will be able to share the slides with Vickie so she can distribute them to us. I think it is unusual for us to have all that information in one place like you presented it this morning. So thanks very much for that.   One of the things that you mentioned -- this is a followup to all of my colleagues' questions -- you mentioned that what you really need to do to see the health disparities issues revealed in these populations is to go there and to talk to people who work in health and to see the way people are living.   Our job here on this committee is to see that there are statistics and figures that can be put together in order to create that picture for people who can't go there, because 8,000 miles, we simply are not all going to be able to go there. Unless these issues are eliminated for the American public, for the Congress, they are just not going to be taken care of. So it is our job to try to figure out how to get the data that would present an accurate picture of what is going on.   You said you weren't a data person, but obviously you work with data, and you have been talking about gathering data. Could you give for us a sense of -- you have mentioned a number of data sources. I know that a number of the national data sources we have, in fact, all of them as far as I know, including the California health interview survey, have inadequate numbers of Pacific Islanders, Asian sometimes, but Pacific Islanders, to be able to analyze the data.   As we learned in the last hearing, there is quite -- they tend not to be concentrated in areas where we can focus our data collection efforts on that. So what do you think is missing? You mentioned a lot of things we do have, but what do you think is missing that we need in order to have a better picture of the health disparities and causes of health disparities in Pacific Islanders in particular?   MS. PEREZ: I think we need an investment in resources that actually enable us to work closely with these populations, so that we can really get the data. I think without those resources, it is really hard.    In the regional health administrator's office, for example, programmatic wise in his office, there is just four of us. We work with the Office of Population Affairs, Women's Health and Minority Health. We together work at sharing information. That is, sometimes I have information that one of the other staff people doesn't have.   One of the things that we always struggle with is that it is difficult for us, because there isn't a standard way of collecting the data for the populations, but also that we have to go to a number of different resources to get that information. There are few opportunities for really sharing the information and updating the information in a regular manner that at least for our population and our subpopulations in the region is usable.   So I think resources in terms of researchers and certainly being able to provide resources so that we can get the information that we need, for example, out in the Pacific Basin in these populations is I think just critical. We always say resources, but it really is very key, and a commitment to making sure that we have this information.    Understanding the populations that have migrated from the Pacific to the U.S. is a challenge and very exciting, and we are very proud to be probably the most diverse region in the whole country, but the challenges that are there exist. In order to really understand our populations that are here, we can get information from them certainly, but I think it is also important for committees such as this and other experts that you rely on for your information to make that trek to at least one of the countries to really feel the impact of what that is all about.   So I think resources will be the key, not just money, but resources in terms of experts and time and commitment.   DR. MAYS: Audrey, then Eugene.   MS. BURWELL: I just wanted to make a few supportive comments on what Christina has said about data. There are many non-governmental organizations that provide detailed data on the Pacific Islander populations. We have here in California the Northern California Cancer Center, that I think you will be interested in. Scarlet Gomez will speak tomorrow on some of those issues that you were talking about, the impact of acculturation on the health of Vietnamese, and the visuals. You also have a rich resource at the university here at UCSF, Dr. Marian Lee, who has done a lot of work in those areas.    So you're right, the national data sets just don't have enough detail. Even the whole Healthy People series, 2000 and 2010, you will see a number of the health indicators were developed using other data sources.    DR. MAYS: Eugene.   DR. LENGERICH: Thank you very much for the good orientation to the region.     As Vickie had stated early on, the role of the committee is to be -- at least, one of the roles of the committee is to be advisory to the Secretary of the Department. You work with a section of that Department, so I was wondering if you could help educate me a little bit about what you perceive as your region's role in the collection, analysis and utilization of such data. For example, is it to collect the data that would be necessary? Is it to bring individuals from the various groups or geographic locations together with the people in Washington who do the national surveys? Would it be some other specific role?   So I guess in terms of our recommendations going back, I need a little bit greater understanding what the role of the region should be in that scheme, and then what are the barriers to accomplishing that.   Then thirdly, as a specific item is, what role do you play in the GIS grant and community grant that you spoke briefly about? I have some interest in that, as well as an example of data collection. You have a data collection and utilization process that is intended to help facilitate the health improvement of various groups within your region.   MS. PEREZ: With respect to the role, I'd say all of the above that you mentioned, but also I would add that we see our role as enabling the advocates in the community to utilize data and also to develop new data so that they through the data can look at outcomes and hopefully improve the health outcomes of the populations.   Certainly it is important to build the capacity of the community to understand how to utilize data. One of our goals is to develop partnerships with our community-based organizations so they can build their technical capacity around data.   Also, some of the barriers that exist have to do with limited resources to be able to do that in a larger way, to do those things in a larger way. But certainly we have -- there are barriers. There are also a lot of enthusiastic advocates out in the community who have ideas on how to make some of these technical and capacity building interventions happen in the community.    The GIS project that I mentioned is in fact one of those projects. We were approached by APCHO, who was very excited when they saw a GIS presentation and said, this would be a wonderful tool to take out to our community and to tailor a curriculum module that would enable us to -- a curriculum module tailored to the Asian, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander population, and train our participants in how to use that kind of information, not only for being able to understand the community better, but also to be competitive in terms of grants, federal grants and other grants.   So we see our role as building the capacity of the community so that in their efforts to improve the health of the population, they are supported.   DR. LENGERICH: Thank you, that is very helpful.   DR. MAYS: Suzanne.   DR. HEURTIN-ROBERTS: Hi, I'm Suzanne Heurtin-Roberts of the National Cancer Institute. I apologize, I came in late.   One of the things that really struck me was the great linguistic diversity represented among the Pacific Islands. To what extent is this a problem for local communities using data sets or having access to data? And what kind of recommendations might you make to address that, if in fact it is a problem?     MS. PEREZ: I haven't thought about it actually in that way. What I have thought about it in is the way some of the cultural linguistic -- I won't call them barriers, I think I don't think they are barriers. I think it is a richness in the population when we were able to speak in a number of different languages. But I do know that just understanding how -- making that cultural leap and intellectual leap at some level about understanding the data may be more difficult for folks who are limited English proficient.   I think access -- I guess I don't think of it so much as the language being a barrier in terms of access. I'd have to think about that a little bit more. I think of it more the language being a barrier in terms of receiving services, and that providers and contractors who provide -- or private providers of health care don't always understand the particular needs of the population, and may incorrectly use existing data on minority populations to make assumptions that are incorrect.   So I don't think of it so much as a barrier in terms of the population using the data. I look at it more as a reverse, that is, the provider population interpreting that data and using that data in such a way that they make assumptions about a population because they have read something about Asian, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander populations from one document.   DR. MAYS: I'm going to piggyback on Suzanne's question, because I actually had a language question, so this may be a good time to do it.   One of the things that we struggle with particularly at the federal level is the ability to be able to have our surveys in languages other than English and Spanish. I know even as a researcher, quite often when we go out in the field and we think about the concept of translation, and you look at the number of languages for example that exist in the population.   If the federal government had the resources, would the region be able to provide both interviewers as well as individuals who could do the translation of some of the survey instruments? And would that be possible?   For example, if we wanted to ask a question on utilization of health insurance, and we wanted to talk about plans, and we had all these different terms that we wanted to use, what are some of the challenges that we would face in translating say the national health interview survey, the various MEPS -- well, not MEPS, but some of the various surveys that we do, would California be a region that could provide expertise to do that?   MS. PEREZ: I think California would be an excellent place to do a pilot or something like that. We have hundreds of languages spoken in this country. We have hundreds, actually thousands, of health professionals with advanced degrees, who are not able to practice in this country because of the licensing issues, but certainly are an incredible source of information and expertise and translation.    I can't say that all of those folks have been prepared to translate statistical information, but we have a population that could certainly try to meet that challenge. Certainly California does not have the resources to do that, money resources. We have the people resources that would probably be willing to work on something like that, and certainly we have a number of public and private entities who might be interested in doing that.   DR. MAYS: Suzanne, I don't know if you want to continue questioning?   DR. HEURTIN-ROBERTS: No, that's okay.   DR. MAYS: Edna?   DR. PAISANO: My questions relate to the previous questions. You had talked about the different time zones and the mileage difference. In those Pacific Islands, and with census and surveys, you either mail the questionnaire or you call the home. What kinds of communications are in place? Is there a mail system to each household? Are there telephones available?   Secondly, you talked about researchers' needs for going into those places. Along with that, -- of course, my work has been with the Alaska Native and Native American populations. Are outside researchers really welcomed in those communities to do that kind of work?   MS. PEREZ: The Pacific Island population I think -- I don't think that there is a barrier to approaching the state health representatives about doing research, in terms of the -- because having visited Culcheray over a year ago, they were actually very open to continuing -- I wasn't a researcher, I worked as a coordinator for minority health -- they were very interested in opportunities for doing research and working with some researchers or experts.     Not everyone has a phone. In fact, there are a very few people with cell phones on island only, but in order to use a phone, you would need to walk a block or two to use the phone. There are Internet stations where you can go and use the Internet for -- I think it is around ten hours during the day. It opens at a certain time and closes at a certain time. Sometimes some of them are open a little bit longer. But there are limitations there in terms of communication that you wouldn't find on the continental U.S., certainly.   But I think research is a very welcomed activity there, in partnership.   DR. BREEN: Is there mail delivery to eery house? That was another question.     MS. PEREZ: That I don't know. I wasn't there long enough, and no one wrote me while I was there, so I couldn't tell. But calling just San Francisco to touch base with my family, I would say up until 1 o'clock to be able to speak with them at 6 o'clock in the morning their time. So there are certain differences or different opportunities that you will need to work with.   DR. MAYS: Let's see if we have any questions from any of our audience participants? Would you please identify yourself?   MS. SORENSEN: Kathy Sorensen with the Hawaii Department   of Health. I wanted to say, I can appreciate what you say about going to visit the places. I had an opportunity about 15 years ago to work in several jurisdictions. It is not that they don't collect the data; that had collected lots of data.    That is part of my two-part question. Has there been any data training, how to collect data, ongoing by the staff? Also, is there any work towards developing of core data sets, and that would include standardizing, and helping in that sort of sense?   MS. PEREZ: I can answer the second question really quick. I don't know on that one. In terms of the data training, we are actually working very closely with the Pacific Islander Health Officers Association, which is a representative of the jurisdictions. Hopefully through that partnership we will be able to -- and data is definitely one of the priority areas for that association, that we will probably be doing some work with them on data.   MS. BURWELL: If I can just add, in terms of vital statistics, I think Guam and one or two others are getting technical assistance from the National Center for Health Statistics.   MR. LOCALIO: I have a followup question based on one of your responses. You mentioned the need to build a capacity in the community to use data, and enable -- given the technical capacity to use data that might be available, and you also talked about the need for resources in order to have this data generated.     The problem is, suppose we had resources made available to NCHS to do a targeted survey of any of these subpopulations, and suppose to enhance the usefulness of any of those data we had GIS information. Suppose we took off everybody's name and their address. Under current statutes and regulations, the only place you could use those data would be in the main office of NCHS in Maryland.   Now, that means that somebody would have to go there physically to be able to use that. Would that be responsive to those needs?   MS. PEREZ: Well, let me phrase it this way. It would be great if you could have satellite NCHS offices around the country, five.   MR. LOCALIO: Thank you very much.   DR. MAYS: We have no -- I just want to make sure; Sheryl, we have no Internet questions? Great, thank you.   We greatly appreciate this introduction. I think it was perfect, in the sense that it gave us a broader review of the issues, the challenges, and I think you did quite well at giving us a sense of what we might be able to recommend to think about how to deal with some of those challenges. So thank you very much, we are very appreciative of your time.   MS. PEREZ: Thank you very much. Welcome to San Francisco.   DR. MAYS: Thank you. We are going to move to our next presenters, because I can see that our colleagues are here. Can we take about a five-minute break, to give you some time to load up? Then I will introduce you when we return.   (Brief recess.)   DR. MAYS: I think we are back on. For those of you out there on the Internet, the phone number is 877-939-8305. The host is 288088. They don't need the host? Sorry, you only need -- once you dial 877-939-8305, is then the participant, which is 278561.   Let's turn to our next presentation. We are very grateful and quite excited to have our colleagues from the Asian Pacific Islander American Health Forum. We know them quite well from much of the work that they have been doing in this area, which not only does it benefit California, but it benefits us nationally.    For those of you who know who the chair of the committee is, that is John Lumpkin. He used to be in the Illinois Department of Public Health. Ho Tran, who is now the president of the Asian Pacific Islander Health Forum, was also there. So by way of Chicago, she also has come to California. So we are very happy to have here.   With her is Gem Daus. Many of us also know him. He is also going to be talking a little bit about some of the access issues in terms of Asian, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander population.    So, Ho Tran, thank you very much for being here. The California bridge is here or something else, in terms of how long it takes to travel, so we greatly appreciate the time investment that you put in, even though you live here, just the time to get here to be with us today. So thank you very much.   Agenda Item: The Need for Detailed ANHOPI for Health Policy - Ho Tran     DR. TRAN: Thank you so much for the invitation today to present, especially to Vickie.   The session that I am going to present, it is on health data needs for the elimination of health disparities for Asian, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander populations. This is a testimony to the Subcommittee on Populations, National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics, submitted by the Asian Pacific Islander American Health Forum.   The overview. We talk about who we are first, and introduce ourselves, and especially who we represent and the findings and our recommendations based on information that is very much based on the recommendations that the testimony will be talking about.   What is APIAHF? It stands for Asian Pacific Islander American Health Forum. It is a very long name, so whenever I introduce myself, usually I have to take two breaths. So it make it short, we call it the Health Forum. We are a national advocate for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.   The history. The organization was founded in 1986 by a group of Chinese physicians and especially activists in the community in San Francisco, in response to a report on minority health put out by the Reagan Administration. This report was only about black health in relation to white health, so we were even not in the picture. So now the organization exists to make sure that our needs are being heard, and to be at the table when decisions are being made.     Our mission is very much proactive. We started initially to be promoting to improve the health of Asian Americans, but just recently we changed to a more proactive way, which is to enable Asian Pacific Islanders to attain the highest possible level of health and well-being.   So what do we do? We are a national policy advocacy organization. Our main core value is on research. Based on the research we draft policy advocacy pieces. At the same time we do have programs within the organization. We do have a cancer survivor network, which is at a national level, understanding that cancer is not very much studied among API, and especially the support on survivorship.   We do have capacity building for its prevention, and we are providing for technical assistance as well as capacity building organizational management for CBOs in the community. We work very closely with five organizations in the community. One is the Maui Foundation in Maui.   We do have a census information center. Our policy director, Gem, will be talking to you afterward. The health information network is being funded by the Office of Minority Health at least for the last five years. It is information sharing on the Internet, very much informative, at the same time culturally but not yet linguistically appropriate.   We do have a national institute on domestic violence. We are not a direct service provider, but more on capacity building, technical assistance and research.    Finally, not least is the tobacco education network and the funding comes from the state of California, and we work as a coalition of networks statewide, as a consortium.   When we talk about our main core value, it is very much on the policy department. For the health forum policy platforms, it is to increase access to health care. It is a value of the organization as a vision when it was started by the group in 1986. With this increase in health care we want to have quality in health care as well.   In order to increase the access as well as the quality, we also want to assure a diverse and competent health care work force, and especially increase research and data collection. Last but not least, it is to increase community-based health promotion and disease prevention program.   Who do we represent? Before I go into who do we represent, I just want to stress again about the way we function at the organization. We are very much into coalition building, and everything we do, we do with partners. So the reason we are here is that we are working very much with all of you to make sure that API is being touched upon.   These will be our members, researchers, community-based organizations and health care providers in the API communities. But we also work with other racial and ethnic groups. As an example we work very closely with an organization called Alpha 21. It is in your packet. We will be holding the first conference for this organization. Alpha 21 came out of -- it is a multicultural, multiracial ethnic organization for the parity in health for all populations. So the conference is this coming Saturday from nine to four p.m.     This is very important, because numbers count, but more importantly we can and should work together to accomplish common goals. We do have the same problems. It might be diverse either from the culture, from the linguistic, but basically we do have the same problems.   Who are we representing at the organization? The name speaks for itself. It is the Asian Pacific Islander population. I am not going to touch much about the very specific demographics data, but to show you how the Asian population has grown over the last decade. Based on this transparency, we are 13.2 percent -- I'm sorry, we are missing one word here, the growth rate. The U.S. population growth rate, it is 13.2 percent. Asian alone population is based on the census data, the Census 2000. The Asian population alone will see a growth of 48 percent, but if you count Asian alone or in combination, it is now almost a 72 percent increase. That is from 1990 to the year 2000. The minimum-maximum range for the increase in the past -- when we talk about Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander population, that the 1990 census counted 365,000 Pacific Islanders. Using the Pacific Islander alone population in the year 2000, this population increased by 34,000, or 9.5 percent between 1990 and the year 2000.     In the Pacific Islander alone or in combination, population is used, an increase of 509,000, or 140 percent results, this from ten-year range. The minimum-maximum range for the increase in the Pacific Islander population was 9 percent to 140 percent increase. You can see the wide range of the percent, of the rate, and it is also gives an impact on how from the researcher standpoint we used the data either alone or in combination altogether for all denominators.   In terms of the percent distribution of selected detailed Native American and other Pacific Islander groups by alone or in combination population in year 2000, the graph shows that for Native American alone, you have only 35.1 percent. But once you combine together in combination with one or more other race and/or Pacific Islander detailed group, you can see almost double the number. For Samoan, it is the reverse, so we have 68.3 percent alone, and in combination it is 31.7. Tongan is 75.2, and combination is 24.8. Guamian, 62.9 percent and Fujian, 72 percent.   Of all respondents who report Native American, either alone or in combination, 65 percent reported one or more other races of Pacific Islander groups.    What are the findings, what we have found to be the state of API data as of now. The Census is perhaps the best example of how data collection can work for APIs. We can detail the description by forming Asian and ANHOPI subgroups. But all the data gathering efforts are not so informative.   The findings, it is two examples. The first is the implementation of the 1997 OMB standard, and the second one is the Healthy People 2010. From the implementation of the OMB standards, as you know the 1997 standards mandated the use of the minimum five race categories when collecting race data. These included Asian as well as a separate category for ANHOPI. So everything the report found as of this year. The Health and Human Services implemented the revised standards for 85 percent, which is 149 of the 175 forms. 128 over 175 forms were used, used multiple race reporting. So we do commend HHS for the broad implementation of these standards.   I believe that we all know about Healthy People 2010, and you do have a copy in your package as well. The second key finding is in Healthy People 2010. Healthy People 2010 is a comprehensive nationwide health promotion and disease prevention agenda for improving the health of all people in the nation by the year 2010. It serves as the plan of action and resource allocation for the HHS.    Our stated goal for Healthy People 2010 is to eliminate health disparities. However, there is very little data on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. This paucity of data in this and other federal government data sets will make it difficult to measure programs toward eliminating health disparities.    We knew that this could be the case, so in order to assess the situation, we recommended at the time that the document use the following notations: Asian or Pacific Islander data. They took this suggestion, and the suggestion was that when there is no Asian or Pacific Islander data, to specify whether Asian or Pacific Islander data has not been collected at all as a DNC, Asian or Pacific Islander data has been collected but has not yet been analyzed as DNA, and Asian or Pacific Islander has been analyzed but is not reported due to small sample size, DSU.   We commend the HHS for taking our recommendation. You can see that it is being shown, the data is being shown from Healthy People 2010. This clarification is very useful for prioritizing future efforts in data collection and analysis for API.   Of the 22 objectives in the Healthy People 2010, only three currently comply with OMB. Six only have aggregate data of API data. Five have both aggregated for Asians but not for ANHOPI, and eight do not even have statistically reliable aggregated data for API.   What are the consequence? The consequence that the under representation of API and inadequate sample sizes in many national, state and local surveys render many databases useless for examining demographic and policy related trends affecting API. I have to say that when I belonged to the national cancer PRT just held in Chicago, and I looked into the data for API, most of the data is either DNC, DNA or DSU, very little information about API on cancer information.   Another consequence is that the under representation of API, example are previous attempts to create a health clinic failed when API population numbers were linked together as one group. The Asian population numbers rendered the API statistics insignificant. Therefore, indicating PIS not having health problems and not needing a health clinic, so that is what is happening in San Diego, California, found by the Pacific American Foundation.   The recommendations from the organization which we also feel we are representing the API population, to collect more disaggregated data. As an example, it is more into some other data for API. When I invited to talk, representing to speak on behalf of API on health issues, it is sometimes very difficult for me to make a case, because most of the time we felt much better as numbers in comparison with other populations. Example like, we have better infant mortality rate, we have lesser rate of cancer, but when you disaggregate the data, that shows a loss of diversity within the API population.   For smoking cessation example, even that we have a lower rate of smoking in comparison to the white population, 18 percent for API in general, but once you disaggregate the data, 87 percent of Vietnamese smoke -- no, 67 percent of Vietnamese smoke, 87 percent of Cambodian and Laotian people smoke. So just to give you the diversity, not to say that for ANHOPI we don't have enough data to show that picture.   What we recommend to this committee is to follow the Census example in order to collect enough data, not only for the minimum five, but for subgroups as well. I can share with you taking from the policy brief from the UCLA. I will talk a little bit more about that.   This is now the form on the Census form. As you can see, we have the person's race, white, black, African American or Negro, American Indian or Alaska Native, and from that we have to print name of principal tribe. For the ANHOPI we have at least three diverse racial ethnic groups: Asia Indians, Chinese, Filipino, Other Asians, and then to print their race, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Native Hawaiian, Guamanian, Samoan and other Pacific Islander.   Another recommendation is for API population. It is to convene experts to determine solutions to the methodological problems posed by small populations. What are the valid and reliable methods for characterizing the health of small populations. Just to give you an example from the policy brief from UCLA that was extrapolated from the data, and we do have some information about the study of health of Asian and ANHOPI. I can say that they are much less than other population.   Example for cancer screening test by race and ethnicity in California year 2001. For Asian, for Pap test it is 71.5 percent, but for ANHOPI it is 69.1 percent. So all the numbers for ANHOPI is very, very negative. Mammogram, 63.4 percent, RC screening, 39.1 and PSA test isn't even statistically reliable.   We always blame the low socioeconomic impacts on the negative findings at the same time, but from the findings from NCHS even that are below the 200 percent of federal poverty level are above for ANHOPI, that are very much less. For the Pap test, they are 57.3 percent below poverty level, and for above 78.2 percent, in comparison to other population it is much, much less than the other population. To say that for the percent of recent cancer screening test by race and for covered by Medi-Cal, it is the same, so I don't want to take much of your time.   Another recommendation, it is to conduct more small targeted surveys, assess populations of which we don't know what we have in any sizeable numbers in the large national surveys. I can say that Vickie was talking about, when I was back in Chicago working for the Department of Public Health, that it is very difficult even to make a case at the state level for small populations, because it is always that you are not even existing. But we would like very much to see, if we don't have the percentage, to see the trend of other population, so it is a challenge for researchers, not to go only by race, but also by trends, to analyze existing data as indicated in Healthy People 2010.    Another recommendation is talking about language issue, that language does impact data on researchers. It impacts because if people do not understand the questions, the answer will be very much different, or even because of the language there will not even be an effort to reach out to the population. An example is the BRFSS. In my state at the time -- now my state is California, but Illinois, the two languages were only English and Spanish, so how can we say that BRFSS represents the population, because there is no language in the Asian population, so how we can be represented. So to collect primary language data more opportunely, to conduct surveys in languages besides Spanish on a regular basis, and if it is difficult to understanding that the cost of resources -- I heard about the resources, but maybe at least as a start to translate the information in the questionnaire in other languages. But it is just a suggestion, but it is just a glimpse of the issue, because also the questionnaires might need also to be culturally competent at the same time, at least as a start. So do the validated translations of survey questions and instruments.   Another recommendation is to increase the capacity for ANHOPI researchers and organizations to conduct health disparities research, to insure that ANHOPI are included in programs that target under represented minorities, particularly at NIH. The last is the third one, AAPI survey institutions, H.R. 333, and I think you have the information here.   To require the Social Security Administration to collect race and ethnicity data, because it is very important for Medicare population, and to fund the American Community Survey. Evaluate programs on previous recommendations. You have it in your packet, that is the health data needs of the Pacific insular areas, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, so we need to do some evaluation of this report.   Thank you for your attention.   DR. MAYS: Thank you very much. Gem, would you like to follow?   Agenda Item: Assessing ANHOPI Data: Gem Daus   MR. DAUS: Good morning. My name is Gem. I work in the Washington, D.C. office of the Health Forum. What I am going to present is some information on the census information centers, of which we are one.   I'll give you some basic information on the CIC program, some actual data that is in the green packet that we passed around. Then also, I wanted to highlight a few issues that were presented by the Census 2000 and ways that you can support the community.   The Census Information Centers or CICs is run out of the Bureau of the Census Customer Liaison Office. The reason for this program is really to disseminate census information particularly to under served communities. There are 50-plus designated CICs, and we are a diverse set of organizations, ranging from direct service community-based organizations, some universities, some national advocacy organizations, as well as some tribal nations like the Navaho Nation is one.   What the Census provides us is free data, training, special products and also special access to some databases and other in-kind support. I also wanted to mention that part of the special access is actually access to an advanced query system, so that we don't have to go to Suitland to run those queries. They know when it is our computer logging in, and we can run those kinds of queries.   This is from a survey that we did last year to see what the Census Information Centers were doing. You can see that mostly, they are doing a lot of racial and ethnic data research. The diversity of the CIC is that all of the quote-unquote minimum five are represented. The other activities, writing grants and proposals, research and data analysts, advocacy, program planning, also business and economic research, grant making and measuring policy impact.     This is information and dissemination that we do, both for ourselves in our program as well as for customers. There are several that serve particularly Asian, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander populations. The ones that I put in yellow are the ones that have done work relating to health. For example, the Asian American Federation of New York did some studies on Chinatown in New York and how they were affected by 9/11, particularly how they fared in terms of mental health. So that is a real great example of an organization using the census data to do some work for their local community.   The National Asian and Pacific Center for Aging in Seattle is doing a lot of work trying to characterize the elderly Asian population. The Social Security Administration has very limited data on the race and ethnicity of its enrollees, and therefore Medicare has bad data, because Medicare gets its data from SSA. So they are trying to wrestle with that to figure out what the needs are for these populations.   (Foreign phrase) is the Native Hawaiian health system, and you have some testimony in your packet from them. Then the Urban Coalition in Minneapolis works very much with the Hmong population there, in particular using census data to advocate for public programs like TANF, welfare.   We have a website that isn't quite live yet, cicinfo.org, but it should be live in a few weeks. Then of course, you can always go to the census.gov site, which is very big.   For us at the Health Forum, we respond to data requests. We get calls. Most of the time they are pretty easy to handle on the phone. We have done needs assessments. We did one for Alameda County to help them justify an after-school program. We have work in census data in our fact sheets, and of course we are doing advocacy.   We have also done training and technical assistance. If you have ever used the American Fact Finder, which is the query system on Census, for most people it is not natural. It is counterintuitive. So what we have found is that we have to train people how to use it and how to think like Census. So we have done these trainings in five cities. They include a day to go over just the census information, as well as another half day to go over health databases. We take them basically on a tour of both national health databases as well as ones that are available from their state or from their state data centers and other sources.   Then finally, one of the other things that we try and do is coordinate with the other API CICs, particularly in how to present data consistently. Because of the multi-race issue and because of the number of categories and different ways that you can cut things, it is easy for people to get mixed up and wonder what it is they are presenting and what it is they are reading. So we do try and be consistent in our presentation of the data.   In your packet there is an Excel spreadsheet that looks like this. I just wanted to give you an example of some of the data that is available.   The first two pages is the top ten states for each of the Asian ethnicities. So for example under Asian Indian, the top ten states listed in order, the population, and then the percent. Then there is also a running cumulative percentage. So you see that 75 percent of the Asian Indian population is in ten states. For the most part, number one is California, except for Bangladeshi and Pakistani in New York is number one.   The last two pages is a similar analysis, but for the Asian, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander; 80 percent of this population is in ten states, and California, Hawaii, Utah, Washington, Texas, New York, Florida and Nevada, Oregon and Arizona.   This is the low numbers, both of them represented the low numbers, not the multiracial numbers. Then the last page is -- I wanted to give you a sense of some of the Pacific Islanders. When you see U.S. totals, that does not include American Samoa, CNMI or Guam. When you see a population total for U.S., it does not include those Pacific Islanders. It includes Washington, D.C., it includes Hawaii, it includes Puerto Rico sometimes, but it does not include the Pacific Islanders. That is why I broke out in this case the numbers of Pacific Islanders in these places.   We are hoping to do these kinds of data for other characteristics such as poverty, disability and other things that are available from the long form data.   Now, because we have this great mass of data, there are some issues, particularly in health because of the number of categories now. The question becomes, can we characterize the health of these different categories, in particular the multi-racial categories.    Then the other issue is, can we measure change in health status. The Census is one degree away from most data sets, so if the Census changes, it ripples throughout anything that any other survey does. Then the last issue is looking forward to Census 2010.    On the first two issues, the answer is yes-but. I think you know probably in some cases better than I that all of these categories and all of these changes bring up a lot of issues because of comparability, what is the actual changes in population from 1990 to 2000. In the examples that Dr. Tran showed, you saw that it was a range; which of those numbers would you use as your denominator.     There are methods for bridging, so that you can get a standard denominator and create a rate, create an incidence. But still, you have to think about all of the machinations you have to go through to get good data. The base really does ripple through the whole system.   So comparing 1990 to 2000, you have to be very careful how you make those comparisons. The other thing is, because Census was one of the first surveys to use the new OMB standards, a lot of the data that we are seeing now, because they were collected before 2003, are not yet presenting data in the same way. So it is sometimes difficult to match those one set to another.   The American Community Survey I wanted to mention, even though it is not a part of DHHS. This is the survey that will replace the long form in Census 2010. The plan is that in Census 2010 there will only be a short form, and that the data that we normally get from the long form will be gotten from the American Community Survey, which hopefully will be done more often, I think yearly or maybe every other year.   The problem is that it is currently being tested, and Census funding typically dips between the big censuses. One of the things that we advocate for is to keep their funding up so that they can do the testing that will allow them to do a good American Community Survey.   One of the things that we are concerned about is that outreach and translation will not be as extensive as it was for Census 2000. So once again, people who don't speak English will not be represented, people from small populations may not be represented, and the sampling frame for Census 2000 was one in six. We don't know what it is going to be for the American Community Survey, but we hope that it can be -- it would be great if it could be as good as or better than Census 2000. But of course, they need some funding to do that.   These are the -- this is information on the long form. Then these are the kinds of information that we were able to get. So a lot of beyond populations. These are the indicators that we really look at to see how a population is doing.    We have started an analysis for California of language isolation and languages spoken at home by county, and we are hoping to do that for ten other states.   The last thing I wanted to say is that the Census does not have grantmaking authority. So all of us at Census Information Centers, we get free data, we get training and all of that, but we don't get any money from the Census. So what we have to do is recover our costs, so sometimes we may charge for what we do, especially if it is a pretty intensive search. We do also get grants and form partnerships. We are currently working as a group among the 50 to see if we can actually get some funds that will help all of us.   Just so you know, Census Information Centers are like a lot of other organizations, in that we have our staffing issues and our funding issues, but we have really powerful tools that can help our communities.   So that's it.   DR. MAYS: Thank you. Let's open it up for questions. We will start here with the members first. Virginia, and then Russell.   DR. CAIN: Thank you very much. Both presentations were very helpful and we appreciate them.   I wanted to -- this could go to either one of you, but reflecting back to some of the comments that Dr. Tran mentioned, I want to go back to some of the language issues that you talked about, particularly with regard to data collection.   By collecting data mainly in English or Spanish, do you have any estimates of what percentage of the population we are missing, and is that particularly concentrated in some subgroups rather than others?   MR. DAUS: I'll start. That is one of the reasons we started analyzing the language data, both language isolation and who doesn't speak English very well, so that we can see where those pockets are.   The Asian population and the Pacific Islander population are pocketed. You can see from the list of ten states, we are concentrated pretty much in metropolitan areas. So hopefully what we will be able to see is what the language isolation is for Hmong versus Vietnamese versus Japanese. Japanese for the most part speak English, Japanese Americans. Hmong, you probably have a higher language isolation rate there. Then where the Hmong are, Minneapolis, Fresno, Sacramento. So you will see those kinds of concentrations.   DR. TRAN: I don't have the exact percentage, but I can say that it would be a large percentage, because they don't possess the skills as to respond to a questionnaire, but they feel more comfortable to speak in their own language. So even for the Vietnamese population, they came in different waves. The first wave came in 1975, but if you ask a question in English or in Vietnamese, they would prefer to do it in the Vietnamese language.   DR. BREEN: I believe that 60 percent of Asians in California, according to the CHIS, were immigrants.   DR. MAYS: Russell.   MR. LOCALIO: Thank you very much, you have been most helpful. I have a question. I want to give you an example as to the extent and detail of data that you have access to through a CIC.   For example, if someone asked how many males ages 40 to 45 living north of Lake and south of 15th and Minneapolis are there, is that the type of detail that you have?   MR. DAUS: You can get that data down to the census tract level. There are confidentiality filters, though. I forget what the three criteria are, but there is a level at which you may not get any data.   MR. LOCALIO: I see, because if you have age and you have location and you have disability, therefore they will prevent that.   MR. DAUS: And remember, the long form data is a sample, so you are not starting from the census, which is 100 percent.   MR. LOCALIO: This is a Title 13 census restriction that they put on you?   MR. DAUS: Yes.   MR. LOCALIO: These are census data?   MR. DAUS: Yes, these are census data, right.   MR. LOCALIO: Thank you.   DR. LENGERICH: Just to follow up a little bit, do you see any differences between health data, confidentiality, identifiability of health data versus census data, in the way the restrictions that are placed upon the various data sets?   MR. DAUS: Do I see any confidentiality issues?   DR. LENGERICH: Any differences in confidentiality issues between health data and census data that is not specific to health.    Russell's question was very specific about individuals living in that area. Health people may ask the same question, but interested in incidence or prevalence of a particular disease. So my question is, do you see differences in the way confidentiality, identifiability is handled within those two different types of data?   MR. DAUS: I don't know. I know that in addition to Census Information Centers, there are state data centers, and they have the same level of access. They can run their own data queries, and in a sense supply the numbers to whoever needs them. So if they can't get it, no one else will be able to get it, either, because we are using a different system to get those numbers.   I'm not sure if I am answering your question, but they can supply the data, and no one else has to know the search mechanisms or the filters or anything like that.    MS. TRAN: I can say that there is a difference in confidentiality between the two sets. The health data is more issues that is confidential, that is more personal. It affects the health issues and things like that. So for the census data it is not very into the health related issues per se, so that is the difference in confidentiality.   DR. STEINWACHS: Gem, you were making the point that Census doesn't have money resources to help users. It would help me to hear you expand a little bit about what you think is the best way for Census, and it could also apply to DHHS, to try and make it such that groups that want to be able to use the data for purposes of planning, targeting services, identifying problems, can do that.   I guess what Census does do is, it helps with the access, with training. I know that you said you were able to seek out some grants to support what you are doing. Are there some specific gaps that if it were possible to fill in existing groups, including your own, that we ought to try and endeavor to do so?   MR. DAUS: One of the things that we are trying to do, we are funded from the OMH, and as part of our health information network, trying to work in our census analysis as part of that.   One of the things that that I think HHS can do is really help people understand how the two are connected. You have got census data on the one hand, but then you've got all of these health surveys. The census can't really provide that kind of information. But the Data Council or some sort of outreach program can help people understand how the two are connected, how a change in the census causes a change into health data. Then particularly working with communities, in the sense that we try to help our different constituents understand both, I think we only did five; there are so many more we could do.     DR. BREEN: Thank you both for very illuminating presentations. You were talking about the American Community Survey and saying that that is going to replace the long form in 2010. It is going to be a smaller sample size. I did some calculations, and I think it is about 15 percent instead of 20 percent of the U.S. population that will be surveyed more intensively as part of the census effort.   Right now, the role the Census plays in collection of health data is really to adjust the sample sizes from pretty small relative to the Census, pretty small samples of the population to estimate the population. I'm wondering, have you thought about whether ACS could play a role in collecting health data? It is related to this issue of the confidentiality. I think ACS right now, they have a moratorium, but they are a little more open in principle to collecting additional data on ACS than they have been on the long form, but I think they would be very concerned if it were to affect their very, very high response rates.   As you know, the response rates are legislated; you need to respond to the Census if you are asked. So we would be essentially legislating people to answer questions about their health. Have you given this thought, or could you talk about that a little bit, please?   MR. DAUS: It would be nice if they could add a few questions. But I can tell you that --   DR. BREEN: Excuse me, just let me say one more thing. I think it is really the only way an existing survey is going to get the sample we need to gather data on these small populations.   MR. DAUS: Right. I can tell you that with the long form, they went through this process where a lot of people particularly in Congress, who were concerned that the long form was too long. So they did an analysis of every question to see what was supposed by statute, reg and so on and so forth. So anything that was not supported by statute and maybe reg level was taken out.   So to add a question to American Community Survey, I don't know if they are going to do the same kind of thing. I kind of expect that they would, but they have got questions on disability already. So if they are able to add other kinds of questions, I think that definitely would be useful for what you said, the sample size issue.   DR. MAYS: Bob.   DR. HUNGATE: I had two questions that may stand more for my own ignorance than anything else, but I am going to steer into them anyway.   In the Census data, the granularity of data collected for Asian is much greater than that for black. For instance, I don't see Ghanan, and I don't know what has caused that distinction, and is there a change under way there to get more granularity in the black data. That is question one.   MR. DAUS: There is another set of data called ancestry data. That is on the long form, not on the short form. That is where you get African ancestry, European ancestry. You don't get Asian ancestry because that is on the short form.   DR. HUNGATE: So it is somewhere. I noticed that a lot of immigrants in New England from Ghana and different places, and they are recent. It is not so much ancestry; it is current culture.   The second question relates to the suggestion that Dr. Tran made on translation of questionnaires. I find that very interesting and an intriguing way to approach the problem of under sampling of populations.   On the plane on the way out, I was reading the newspaper, and I see where Lightening Flic Wilson, who is the last fluent speaker of Wampanog language, died. He was a direct descendent of the Massasoid. That is a really small population, and there is no way that sampling is going to get at it. Their language is very unique.   Two questions. Is there a definitive listing of languages that are recognized?    MR. DAUS: Yes, the Census does collect language data as well. So it does have a list of I don't know how many, hundreds. And interestingly enough, Native Hawaiian is not one of them.   DR. HUNGATE: But there is a language; it is not there.   MR. DAUS: Right.   DR. HUNGATE: So the list is not complete.   MR. DAUS: That's right.   DR. HUNGATE: So there is not a complete list. That troubles me a little bit, because then you are working from -- you know you are making more approximations someplace along the line.   The other part of this is that you collect data so someone can act on the data. The most likely people to act are those that are in the center of the population that you are involved with, in the geography itself. So the idea of making an effective translation available supporting that to augment the data collection within the community in ways that would be comparable seems to me to be a very attractive system design approach to get at it.   One of the questions that might be answered in connection with that is, we have argued for over sampling, but we haven't I think looked at how many populations would you have to over sample, and what would be the total increase in the number of questionnaires that would have to be -- what would be the cost of doing over sampling.   I guess I am just raising a subject for discussion and am interested in your thoughts, because I'm sure you have thought about it.   MR. DAUS: Yes. I would ask those questions to the people who did CHIS. You may have had that presentation already, but they did translate into six languages, and they had surveyors who spoke language -- that were trained to do surveys in their language. In this first iteration, they got a pretty good sample size for everything except Cambodian, I think.   So I think that would be really illustrative, what were the lessons they learned in terms of whether the translations were even useful, did they like being called on the phone versus visited, things like that.    I know that there are some other localities trying to do similar kinds of outreach. So the reason we made the suggestion about disseminating valid translations is that it is hard enough to do a survey in English; to actually have to translate that and interpret that for another language takes a lot of work. To the extent that it can be used for another purpose, I think that would be useful.    DR. HUNGATE: It seemed to me in thinking about that that if you had an exhaustive list of languages, then you could pursue to see if there is a partnership interest in the translation of a particular language, so that you knew you had the right -- and then a way to make it work. The way in which you go about it is deciding whether it is going to be effective.   DR. MAYS: Edna.   DR. PAISANO: I had two questions, but Nancy Breen asked my first one about health questions on the American Community Survey.    The other question I have in relation to the American Community Survey, is it being conducted in the Pacific Islands as well? I know it will be in Hawaii, but is it being conducted in American Samoa and Guam?   MR. DAUS: I don't know. That's a good question. I'll find out.   MR. HITCHCOCK: You mentioned the HHS Data Council at one point. We had tried to schedule a presentation on the American Community Survey for yesterday's Data Council meeting back in D.C., and we couldn't get representatives to come. But we are scheduling it for December, Edna. You sit on the Council, so you will be able to hear a lot of the answers to these questions.    DR. MAYS: Do we have any questions from members in the audience?    I want to ask a couple that have to do specifically with the recommendations. Let's start with the one that says, convene experts to determine the solutions to the methodological problems posed by small populations. I have two questions. Do you have specific methodological issues that you would like to see covered? And two, what is your suggestion of how we find those experts?   MR. DAUS: I'm not a researcher. I did take a methods class, and I understand sampling and how large numbers make your day. But I also know that there are people who have worked on -- I forget what they are called, but basically statistical methods for rare populations.    So what we want to do is put together the brain power to figure out what that might be.   DR. MAYS: I guess I'm asking if there is a possibility for that. If you have specifics, it would be useful. If you don't have them today, if you have specifics it would be useful if you actually got them to us, because there is a possibility that this might go forth. So while we have you thinking about it, it would be great to find out if as users you see very specific methodological problems that you think should be pursued, and two, who individuals are that have the expertise to talk about this.   MR. DAUS: Elena is right here, you have one there. But I think we have access to -- we work with some researchers, and we are actually convening some HIV/AIDS researchers on Sunday. So I think that we can pose the question to people that we know, to see number one, what kinds of issues they would be interested in, in specific, to answer your question, and also if they know others who might be interested in that kind of committee.   DR. MAYS: We would be interested in receiving that. Do you want to say something?   MS. TRAN: Yes. I just want to reiterate the information from Gem, to invite you to come to -- it is held this coming Sunday, Sunday from nine to 11. It is a group of researchers on HIV, but to think about research in small minority populations, small populations. The address is 450 Sutter, and on the sixth floor.   DR. MAYS: Let me pursue another one of your recommendations, that is, conduct more small targeted surveys that would assess populations which we don't normally have in any sizable numbers. Can you tell us specifically which populations you are suggesting?   MR. DAUS: In most cases it will be the newer populations, the Southeast Asians and the Pacific Islanders. They are not new, but those are usually where we don't have anything. So I would recommend that.   The other connection that has to be made there is, Healthy People 2010 only uses national data sets. So what we would like to see is, is there some sort of addendum or other way that we can say that for this particular objective we don't have national data, but there is some local data or some other data that obviously is only -- it has its limitations, but it might shed some light on the progress for this objective, for this population.   DR. MAYS: Your recommendation on evaluating the previous recommendations on a report that this committee did, again, do you have any specific things that you want us to look at, or anything that is particularly bothersome? Is it determining whether or not those recommendations have been implemented?   MR. DAUS: Yes, in particular -- and I think Christina mentioned this -- to what extent have they gotten the technical assistance, the personnel, the training, to do that kind of data gathering.   I know for example that Guam recently had a visit from CDC to help them set up their surveillance systems for HIV. I think also as well for one of the Marshalls had a similar visit recently. So we would be interested to see how have they grown, so that it is not always a negative picture. I do think there has been some progress made, but we'd like to be able to see that.   DR. MAYS: Anything else? I want to thank you for spending time with us today. It has been very useful. I can say that in particular, your recommendations are well welcomed. You hit very good points, some of which the committee itself has made recommendations.   I will ask Gracie White to share with you for example the letter that we did send to the Secretary about the targeted surveys, so it is something that we are thinking about, and even trying to follow up on. So that was why I was asking you some of those questions.    So this has been very useful, and we greatly appreciate your time, so thank you both for being here.   MR. DAUS: Thank you.   DR. MAYS: We should take five minutes, just so the next speaker can gets set up also. So we'll take a five-minute break to let her switch and get set up, and then we'll get started again, and we will break for lunch at 12:30.   (Brief recess.)   DR. MAYS: We are fortunate to have Elena Yu with us. Some of you may know that she has a background of being with NCHS at one point in time, so I think she is now on both sides of this. So I think that she can be very helpful, in the sense of, as we ask for everything we can ask for, she can also understand the other side, what really happens. So it is very nice to have her with us.     Elena has been -- I saw her do a presentation on the issue of looking at some of the measurement and classification issues, and is exactly the right person to be here with us for this. I really do appreciate your taking the time and pulling this presentation together, so thank you very much. So why don't we start?   Should I say for the sake of Dawn that while she is a professor at San Diego State University, she is also a student at Johns Hopkins.   DR. STEINWACHS: And I should say for Johns Hopkins that we are lucky to have her.   Agenda Item: ANHOPI Measurement and Classification Issues: Elena Yu     DR. YU: Thank you. I hope you all had a very large breakfast, because this session is scheduled for an hour, and we are not supposed to break until 12:30.    I had three versions of my presentation, long, longer and longest. Originally I was prepared to give a 30-minute talk, but this morning I got a message that I should make it longer. So you are going to hear my medium-length presentation on this subject.   I received the hearing questions last Friday, and I did not know how strictly I was to follow those until a confirmation set of hearing questions came to me on Monday from Vickie Mays. I know that this is serious stuff, stuff that I should stick to the theme of these hearings, so I have.   First let me give you an overview of my entire presentation, and we can swing through some of the information that has already been provided by Gem Daus and by Christina Perez and Ho Tran. I would like to just very quickly show the demographic growth rate, population characteristics, and identify the classification and identification issues and what is the relevance in terms of health for wanting to classify and measure ANHOPIs.   Then I would like to quickly move to the meat of my presentation, which is data and data needs, and finally probably drop a few bombshells in terms of recommendations, because my recommendations will call for major paradigm shifts. Unless we really undertake these paradigm shifts, we will never get out of the hole that we have been in since 1960s when NCHS was created.   Asian Americans, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islanders are the second fastest growing minority in the United States. The population increased by my calculation by 76 percent from 1990 to the year 2000. They surpassed the growth rate of Latinos, which is 58 percent, and their number is estimated at close to 30 million, if you include multiracial ANHOPIs.   Fourteen percent of the Asian Americans and 54 percent of ANHOPIs are multiracial, by their own self reports. Immigration contributed about 86 percent of that growth. This has significant implications in terms of surveys you want to conduct, in terms of risk factors and risk markers for health, and in terms of access to care.   The Census data showed that the count of ANHOPIs are 23 percent Chinese, 17 percent Filipinos, 16 percent Indians, 11 percent Vietnamese, 10 percent Koreans, seven percent Japanese and about four percent Hawaiians, and the remaining are others.    Census terminology has changed over time. First we were referred to as Asians, which implied that we were aliens, that we were foreigners, and that we were outsiders. It negates the fact that many of us are U.S. born and some of us are U.S. citizens. Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders, ANHOPI, carries a different connotation and this identification was important for Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders, because the concept of territorial preemption is implied in the identification of the population. They were here before the explorers came, they were, they are, the original inhabitants, and they come from a mixture of Polynesian, Micronesian and Melanesian cultures.   Throughout my presentation, we need to distinguish between ANHOPI and ANHOPI, that is, whether we are showing data including Asians or excluding Asians.    Population characteristics; I'm just going to go over some important points with regards to health that I think are also important to take account of and to consider and to remember when we play health surveys.   One, this population has very large household size, compared to the general U.S. population. 36 percent of them live in households with four or more persons, 19 percent of them live in households with three or more persons. Two-thirds of them speak a non-English language. ANHOPIs 25 years and older are two times more likely than non-Hispanic whites to have at least a college education, but at the other extreme of the spectrum, two times more likely to have had ninth grade education or less. So you are dealing with a population that is extremely diverse at both ends o the educational continuum.   There are a bimodal income and a bimodal employment distribution as well. Many of them are professionals. Many of them are also service workers or laborers, or just simply unskilled workers. They are two times more likely than non-Hispanic whites to be renters, and in the metro areas they pay 20 percent higher rent than non-Hispanic whites. In the suburbs they pay 30 percent more. This is a sign of whatever you call it, but it means that the same income level of $50,000 a year buys you different goods and different houses, and you don't have the same purchasing power. So therefore, any statistical analysis that controls for income does not really control for the population differences and other correlates of that income.   Classification methods. There are many papers written on classification methods. One of them by Vickie Mays compared four different methods of classifying ANHOPIs, whether it is the group that they most identify with, whether you pick the rarest group and give priority in the identification, or whether you use the California Department of Finance, which gives precedence to Latino ethnicity and inflates the Latino numbers, because many Filipinos could be classified as Latinos, or you use a combination of the second and the third method.   Now, having gone through the paper however, I would like to stress the following, that the classification methods really did not significantly impact the health estimates for Asian Americans in CHIS 2001. It did not impact the percent non-elderly adults reporting no insurance, it did not impact the percent of adults with no usual source of health care, the percent of adults reporting asthma diagnosis, percent of women reporting a Pap test in the past year, percent of men older than 50 years old who reported a PSA test. In other words, whatever method you use to classify them, Asian Americans are low by all health indicators.   So what is the big difference for Asian Americans? That is a strange question for me to ask, given that I am an epidemiologist, and that I pay attention to methods. However, they do make a significant difference for the Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islanders.   The variability in estimates range from two percent to ten percent of the estimates. That is how big a difference they make. If I were to pick the rarest group and give that the priority, I would beef up my estimates by ten percent. If I don't, I would deflate it by two percent. So that is the range of variability.   If confidence intervals were included and calculated or could be calculated, then these confidence intervals in my opinion would probably be overlapping, so what is the big deal? Differences for ANHOPIs. The method of classifying ANHOPIs does affect health estimates, and only certain health estimates. In small populations like ANHOPIs, a tiny numerical change will result in a big percentage change, and that is the bottom line message I would like the group to have. But for Asian Americans, they are going to be pretty much the same.     So regardless of the classification method, for example, the percentage of ANHOPIs 18 years and older reporting a Pap test in the past year is lowest in the CHIS 2001 for Asians, followed by Native Hawaiian, compared with Latino, whites and other. I think that we should not lose the substance of the message in our strive to measure API or ANHOPIs accurately.   The critical question is, have we lost sight of what is important by focusing too much time and effort on the classification and measurement of ANHOPIs, such that we neglect the substance of these issues. The Chinese have an expression, (foreign phrase), meaning, it is the tip of the horn of a buffalo. What scholars have been doing has been to crawl into that little space and argue about how big that space is, instead of looking how big the buffalo is. That is a little bit of culture here.   Imprecision exists with every method of classification and measurement, and we have to accept that. ANHOPI classification can be improved however by applying a consistent set of questions. Ask about place of birth to determine nativity, U.S. born or foreign born. That liver cancer data, for example, somebody asked a very good question, and I have an answer for that later on which I shall talk about.   You should also ask about language spoken as a child, because that really determines your mind set, and essentially is correlated with many other factors that are related to health. English language proficiency is very important, because it in some ways influences your access and ability to absorb health information that are out there for the public to consume. Levels of education carries place of birth, because that helps to determine what generation are you in the United States, and urban-rural origin.   So race and ethnicity are social constructions that go beyond biology and genetics. They change with time and place. That is something we need to accept. It is not just unique to only ANHOPIs; it occurs with all groups.   We need transparency in the classification and measurement That is, every publication that studies AAPIs or ANHOPIs should specify how they classify and how they identify these populations. That should be explicitly stated.    The best method of classification depends on the research question. There is no one best method, anymore than there is any one best strategy to study a population. It depends on your research question. Data obtained using different classification methods should not be compared, or should be compared with caution. You should always stress where the differences could lie.   So a critical issue for me is health disparities; do ANHOPIs experience any health disparities compared with other racial and ethnic groups? What barriers exist that deprive them of equal access to the U.S. health care system? Do they receive different or inferior treatment, given the same diagnosis, and why? Do they have different and less desirable outcomes, given the same treatment and why?   Some would argue that lack of agreed-upon method of classification may harm comparability of findings across settings, and therefore we should spend more resources on identifying them and measuring them. Yes, that is important, but my question is, what can we compare if we do not even have population focused surveys to produce the most fundamental baseline or descriptive data for Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders?   The next question people raise is, what about multiple race? Isn't that a confusion? You couldn't tell anymore just how many of them are out there? Well, is it not informative if I tell you that my review of the literature shows me that ANHOPI adolescents who identify themselves as belonging to a multiple race compared to those who identify themselves as belonging to a single race are consistently reported to have a higher rate of depression, greater rate of substance abuse, more school dropouts and out of wedlock pregnancies and pregnancy complications. Are the information not useful and not enough for you to plan for certain kinds of services? I say it is enough, and you can go further. Yes, we can go further if we have resources, but given the limited resources and the $87 billion deficit that we are in, I think that is good enough as a start, and we should get going.   If differences exist, is there inequity in the differences observed between ANHOPI and white American population? Do differences within the ANHOPI population reflect disparities? To what do we attribute these disparities, and what are the social significance of these disparities? I think these are the substantive issues that we should be focusing on.   We should remember always that race and ethnicity is merely a marker. We always hear in epidemiology that all diseases and health have a genetic basis. I sit in the audience and I wonder, don't all diseases have a behavioral basis as well? Would we be better off to devote as much resources to behavioral health research as we do to genetic research, because at least -- we cannot change our genes, but we can change our behavior and lifestyles.   What are the important identifiers of health risk in ANHOPIs? Your nativity? Are you born inside the Pacific Islands or outside the Pacific Islands? We need to know where the parents are born, so we can determine their immigrant status. For example, my view of the literature shows that the Filipinos living in Guam are not much different than the Samoans living in California in terms of access to care. That means there is something about being new in a territory that makes you less knowledgeable about where to go for health care, and that that is an important factor to take account.   Generation; first generation, second generation, third, fourth, fifth for the Japanese, sixth generation. That is important, because it tells you how much of that language they know, how much of the traditions they have kept, and whether they are more Americanized in their diet, in their physical activity level than they are compared to the first generation.   And language. Command of the English language is important, because that almost tells you whether they are going to be included in the health surveys or excluded. Rural/urban area, where did they live the longest before they were age 21? That is almost a very good indicator of adaptability. It is a proxy measure when studies do not have an acculturation measure, and also how well integrated they are into the U.S. society.   There are other relevant identifiers of health risk. Frequent or infrequent use of traditional healers and medicine before age 21, and health literacy, continued use of traditional healers or medicine after age 21, dietary preferences and physical activity, socioeconomic status.   So to sum up, there are many non-genetic confounders that we must collect when we study ANHOPIs. We should ask about nativity, generation in the United States, culture, English proficiency, health literacy, socioeconomic status, dietary preferences, region of origin, whether it is urban or rural, and use of traditional medicine.   The importance of culture. Many researchers on minority health have pointed out repeatedly that if we could just control for SES, health disparities would disappear. Such an attitude in my opinion negates the relevance and ubiquity of language and cultural influences on health. The problem is how to control for SES when the playing field is not level. Minorities have different purchasing power than non-minorities, so controlling for income does not make the two groups comparable, really. There is residual confounding.   Let me illustrate that with this data on health insurance from the CPS-2001, that showed poor people without health insurance for the entire year 2000 by ethnicity. Everybody here now in this chart is equally poor. So that is controlled for SES, controlled for income. So when you control for income, blacks and non-Hispanic whites have the same level of uninsured, but Asian Pacific Islanders and Latinos have higher rates of uninsured. That shows you that controlling for income will not eliminate the disparities that you are seeing. This is primary access to care. Who has access to care? A large percentage of Asians and Pacific Islanders and Latinos do not have the first access to care.   The whole issue of cultural competence is ignored when you just say that all you have to do when you analyze ethnic data is to control for SES, because cultural competence on the part of the health care system is an important contributor to health disparities that we must measure, that we must document, and we must quantify. Where is the data for ANHOPIs?   National surveys of the U.S. population would never in my opinion include sufficient number of ANHOPIs to allow for proper analysis. Routine government surveys sample mostly English-speaking Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. Among the Filipinos who speak Spanish, I can tell you what their age would be; they would be older than I am. I went to schools in the Philippines, I finished college in the Philippines. I was the last cohort of graduates required to take four years of Spanish in college, one year of Spanish in high school, in order to graduate, the last cohort. That means anybody younger than me cannot speak Spanish, but my generation and older, yes, they could speak a smattering of Spanish. So they would not be included in most NCHS surveys so far.   Geographic coverage of many government surveys is the entire United States. But ANHOPIs are not distributed throughout the entire United States, so it is not loaded -- the cards are not stacked up to the favor of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. The kind of sample used by NCHS, which is, sample the population in proportion to the representation in the population, will always result in too few ANHOPIs, and it will always show unreliable estimates for ANHOPIs. It will always show very wide confidence intervals for this group, no matter how you massage that data.   What are some of the barriers to care for ANHOPIs? Who enters the health care system? Available CPS surveys show that non-U.S. citizens are two times more likely to be uninsured than citizens. One-third of the ANHOPIs who live within 100 percent below the federal poverty level were uninsured. The association between education and insurance in this population is actually U-shaped.   What do I mean by that? The largest percentage of uninsured is found among those with lower level of education, and those with the highest level of education. Why? People with a high level of education end up being entrepreneurs, when they cannot find jobs that they qualify for in the U.S. job markets. They send up their own companies. They are high education, they are immigrants, they are healthy. Why should they pay thousands of dollars for health insurance? What would they get out of it?   At one time when I was funded for six years on soft money, every year I never know where my salary for next year was going to come from, I did not pay for health insurance. Why should I? I'm healthy. I want to go see a doctor when it is due, schedule you for an appointment two months from now, when I am sick right now, and I speak English well. So I cannot cope with that bureaucracy; I'd rather fly home. An airline ticket costs me $600. That is cheaper than a health insurance premium I have to pay every month. I fly home, I get my traditional health care. I was raised in traditional Chinese medicine until age 21 when I came to this country. I do not need American doctors, who do not have a prevention orientation to health.    I am trying to share with you the AAPI perspective. I am considered an educated AAPI. What more of the others who are less educated and less exposed to Western cultures?    Children's insurance. One out of every four AAPI children are uninsured, compared to one out of every six for non-Hispanic whites in the United States. This is the latest data. CHIP health insurance extends to only 7.2 percent of AAPI children, compared to one-third of black Americans and one-fourth of Latino children. So that is the extent of uninsurance you are seeing among children of ANHOPI descent.   Barriers to secondary access. There is a study published in 2000 showing that among patients who received managed care in the past year, from 48 physician groups in California and five other states, five measures of secondary access was the worst for AAPIs. These are preventive services, time related access for routine care or general need, telephone access, specialty services, and general access.   The Asian race is significantly associated with less counselling, and medical encounter that requires verbal communication and longer physician-patient contacts, as well as a good grasp of the patient's culture and values. This is a study conducted in 2000.   Let's take smoking cessation, which is a big thing in this country, and which has been very successful in the general U.S. population. Among smokers, smoking cessation is fundamental to maintaining good health. The percentage of smokers in a health maintenance plan is therefore, in my opinion, a very good proxy of the success of mainstream health professionals in lowering smoking prevalence and improving the health of participants.   Let's look at data for Asian Americans. In a Northern California health plan, I shall not name which one, everybody knows it, smoking prevalence of AAPI subgroups is 20.1 percent for Japanese, 18.7 percent for Filipinos, 13.9 percent for South Asians, and 23.1 percent for Asians, in a health plan; these are people who were all insured. Compare that to the Healthy People objective of 12 percent. AAPI females are becoming smokers, 18.6 percent in Japanese-Americans, 34 among Native Hawaiians.    So let's take a very quick look at the initiative to eliminate racial and ethnic health disparities. Let me cover just the six areas, and very quickly fly through some of the data, just to give you a flavor of what do we know and what don't we know, and what do we need to know.   The leading causes of death for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders is cancer, 27 percent, heart disease, 26 percent, stroke, nine percent, accidents, five percent, chronic lower respiratory disease, three percent, pneumonia and influenza, three percent, diabetes, three percent. So while in the general U.S. population, the leading cause of death is heart disease, in this population it is cancer competing with heart disease.   Myth. Asian Americans have a low infant mortality rate. They are therefore a healthy population, and do not experience health disparities. This is the most common data presented by everyone, including NCHS researchers, about how healthy Asians are.   What did I find? Mortality data suffered from misclassification problems that do affect estimates of racial infant mortality. Under reporting errors are reproducible when collection measures are not taken over the years. Asian Pacific Islanders differ in infant mortality rates, and that variability is not reflected when you lump them all together as one group, because the groups that have the worst infant mortalities are smaller in numbers. So when you take an average, that average is inflated, or looks good. So high infant mortality rates and adverse maternal risk factors are found in a group that today is classified by NCHS as other AAPI, so we will never know who they are; we just know that they are the residuals of what they do not classify.   One out of every five AAPI infants born in the normal weight range died in the post neonatal period. Every physician in practice will tell you a post neonatal death is less likely to be due to genetic factors and more likely to be due to environmental factors.    The infant mortality rate due to birth defects is the second highest for AAPIs after Native Americans. In the 35 to 39 year age group, AAPI mothers have two times pregnancy related mortality per 1,000 live births, compared to non-Hispanic whites. More Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders give birth in the age range of 35 to 39; there are more older mothers giving birth among Asian Pacific Islanders. That may explain the higher birth defect rates, and that may explain greater complications as well. But we really do not have systematic studies. We just know from the body of medical literature that these factors are associated, and we know these disparate facts from statistics, but no one has put them together. It is difficult to go beyond these numbers to do any studies with the vital statistics data.   Single gene disorder. Thalassemia is a single gene disorder that disproportionately affects all Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. The reported prevalence overseas for Asians ranges from three percent and 40 percent of the populations studied, depending on how they are sampled.   Sickle cell disease, let me show you as a contrast. We all hear about sickle cell disease among African Americans. It occurs in one out of 390 births to African Americans in California, but thalassemia occurs in one out of 160 Laotian births. How much do we know about it? I have thalassemia. It was misdiagnosed for 27 years of my life as anemia, and I was given iron pills, iron injections, all kinds of treatment. Everybody missed the diagnosis. When I finally was diagnosed with thalassemia by a Canadian physician in Canada, and they have a very good health care system, my brother, who is a physician practicing in the United States in Ohio, said it is impossible, because his medical training told him that thalassemia is a Mediterranean disease. So he said, where is our Mediterranean ancestry? I said, maybe we have some Arab blood, because after all, I was born in a village where in the 13th century, an Arab was mayor, during the silk trade, by the sea route.   So anyway, it was an education for him, an eye-opener for him. He is a U.S. trained physician, he is not foreign trained.   Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have low death rates for cancer, CVD and stroke. That is another myth that we get all the time from many presentations at meetings. Let me show you what my studies found. These are from NCHS reports on deaths, knowing that they are under reporting, and there are some problems there, but nevertheless they are very informative.   I'd like you to concentrate on the group 45 to 54. These are the baby boomer generation. Look at that yellow bar. It is 53 percent of women, AAPI females, died of cancer. That is their leading cause of death, is cancer, of those who died of cancer. You go upwards, 45 percent, 36 percent, 23 percent, so cancer is a major killer, is the major killer for women in this population, and the question is why.   The top two leading causes of death for AAPIs are CVD and cancer, and the distributions change by age. So if you lump them all together just for the age group from 25 and above, it is heart disease, but then if you break it down, you see heart disease really starts to take over cancer as a leading cause of death, is at 65 and above. But Asians don't live long enough to die of heart disease; they die first of cancer.   What about stroke? We heard so much about how good the Japanese diet is, and how low their cardiovascular disease rate is. But few people know that the stroke rate is very high in Japan, as well as among Japanese in California and Japanese in Hawaii.    If you look at the death rate due to stroke, proportion of the population within the Asian community compared to the white community who die of stroke, for every age group from 25 onwards, you see that the Asians have very high proportions dying of stroke. This is for females, and the next chart I didn't show is for males.   Now, what does the clinical preventive services task force recommend? This is the most authoritative source about how to maintain your health. The only preventions proven to reduce coronary events in asymptomatic persons are modifications of risk factors such as smoking, high cholesterol, elevated blood pressure, poor diet and nutrition, overweight and obesity and physical inactivity. Smoking cessation, cholesterol and blood pressure reduction for all with risk factors are highly recommended by the clinical preventive services task force.   Well, there is another myth, that Asian Americans do not have body weight problems, and therefore diabetes is not a major health problem for them. If you look at the death due to diabetes, you see that proportion is not small for Asian Americans. It exceeded the rate for the proportion of whites dying of diabetes. So diabetes is a serious problem for Asian Americans, despite the fact that many of them are thin.   On the other extreme, Pacific Islanders are heavy. So the Asian population may be small and thin, many of them have diabetes, and you have the other extreme, where obesity is associated with diabetes.   How do we prevent diabetes? Adoption of a healthy lifestyle, which includes early detection of glucose intolerance, identification of insulin resistance syndrome, proper diet, regular exercise program, weight reduction, periodic monitoring of blood glucose levels, and adherence to all medications. These are standard recommendations, and the government has been pushing for this. The HHS has been pushing for this.    We know from studies that for persons at risk for diabetes, the effect of lifestyle change, at least seven percent reduction in weight and 150 minutes of physical activity per week, is as good as, if not slightly better than, medication, Metformin, in controlling blood glucose. This came from a big study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. I should have cited it, I forgot.   For persons diagnosed with diabetes, the effect of exercise was better than Metformin when they compared, when they ran clinical trials comparing exercise with Metformin, the leading diabetes medication.    My meta analysis showed -- and I looked at only clinical trials of diagnosed diabetes and physical exercise for the whole world. I found only seven studies. This was a class project I did at Hopkins, with three other students. We read the same papers, but we each do our own analysis and paper writing, and so this is my analysis, which may not be the same as that of my friends, classmates.     We found altogether only seven studies of clinical trials on diagnosed diabetes and exercise. Many of them were poorly done. They were not done long enough, because HBA-1C, which is the outcome measure that measures your blood glucose levels in the past two or three months, many of these studies on exercise were conducted for so short a period, two weeks, three weeks, four weeks, not long enough to show an effect. Yet, it showed an effect when you do a pulled analysis and you take account of variance and the small sample size in there. In fact, it showed a reduction of .7 percent. If you know diabetes and if you know your HBA-1C, you know that the number looks small, but it is a very significant change.   So there is in fact, based on the studies in England and studies that are now coming out from other countries, there is no threshold for glucose control. A one percent reduction in HBA-1C is associated with a 37 percent reduction in the risk for microvascular complications, and a 21 percent decrease in the risk for any end point or death related to diabetes. So the association between HBA-1C and mortality are stronger than any documented association for cholesterol, for BMI, for blood pressure and mortality. If you really want to live long, control your glucose level.   What about HIV/AIDS in the Asian population? It is the sixth leading cause of death for men 25 to 34 years old. It is the eighth leading cause of death for men 35 to 44 years old. Fifty-three percent of the AIDS cases occur in just five SMAs, Los Angeles, Long Beach, San Francisco, Honolulu, New York City and San Diego.   Facts about AAPI HIV/AIDS. The actual numbers are numerically small, but four times as many AAPIs diagnosed with AIDS also have TB, compared to white Americans. Men having sex with men followed by intravenous drug users is the predominant form of exposure category for Asians. Asian Pacific Islanders are two times as likely as whites to report having acquired the disease through heterosexual contacts, because many of the Asian at risk populations are bisexual.   We have extremely limited data on AAPI HIV and AIDS. Access to care issues in this population have not been the focus of research activities in the past two decades. Citizenship and legal immigration status may have restricted eligibility to publicly funded programs which supply the data for routine tabulations that we see.   The other question that is related to issues of health disparities among this population is the question of whose disparities are we talking about. After all, President Clinton only mentioned six major areas of disparities, and there are more areas of disparities for Asian Americans.   Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have disproportionately higher rates of avoidable mortality and preventable diseases due to cervical cancer, liver cancer, because of their exposure to the hepatitis-B virus, tuberculosis, hepatitis-B virus infection, pneumonia and influenza and substance abuse.   To illustrate for tuberculosis, the AAPI TB case rates are about 18 times higher than those of non-Hispanic whites. Foreign born AAPIs are six times more likely to have TB compared to U.S. born AAPIs. More than a third of the AAPI TB cases come from just five countries: Philippines, Vietnam, India, China and Korea.   This graphically illustrates the TB case rates for Asian Americans. The blue bars are Asians, and look how low it is for whites. That is a health disparity issue that was never in Clinton's initiative to eliminate racial and ethnic disparities for Asian Americans.   This is another one for females. It shows a similar pattern. For influenza, I am looking at 65 and over, because we should all be getting the flu vaccines to help prevent complications from influenza. This would indicate to me that this is a population that is not getting flu vaccines in the same frequency as the general U.S. population. It pinpoints an area of health education, and maybe public health practice that we should be doing, because more AAPIs are proportionately dying off from pneumonia and influenza than white Americans after the age of 55.   Recommendations. What are my recommendations to NCHS? It is about time we start thinking about doing special large scale population focused surveys on ANHOPIs, instead of just continually including them in large U.S. populations. We have done so since the 1960s. NCHS was established in 1959. We have done so since the 1960s.   I worked at NCHS from 1981 to '83. I looked at this issue. The questions I raised then are still here today, and that surprises me, that no one has thought of special legislation to do large scale population focused surveys. We have to stop thinking about being included in the major community surveys being conducted in the United States, because we are never going to grow in such large numbers as to be statistically significant in their analysis. So therefore, our health problems will never show up with the same stunning message that it is showing up for black Americans, for Latinos and other groups.   We need special legislation. We need to be working with Asian American lawyers and white American lawyers and black American lawyers to get laws passed, to authorize Congressional funding to NCHS, to the Census, to CDC, to conduct special surveys on ANHOPIs.   Self identification of ANHOPIs is important, instead of observer identification. No one would know looking at me that I have a Filipino cultural background. No one would know that I was raised in a Filipino family. Yet, I am. So these are issues we need to be aware of.    Use of multiple access of classification and health risk identifiers should be included in all health surveys in order to improve racial and ethnic classification and also for service delivery and followup later on of their health problems. Those health identifiers I mentioned earlier, nativity and all those non-generic confounders.    Where do we find the Asians to do our surveys? It is actually both difficult and easy. If you stop thinking about the whole United States and you concentrate on where are they densely populated, then you know where they are. If you look at the ten places with the highest percentage of Asians, nine out of ten is in California. The tenth one is in Hawaii. If you look at the top ten places with the highest percentage of Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders, you will see Hawaii, you see Utah, you see California, Utah again, and California. So you know where to go. It is very easy. You don't need 50 states. The top ten places with the largest number of Asians: New York, Los Angeles, San Jose, San Francisco, Honolulu, San Diego, Chicago, Houston, Seattle, Fremont, California. Top ten places with the largest Pacific Islanders: Honolulu, New York, Los Angeles, San Diego, Long Beach, San Jose, Sacramento, San Francisco, Seattle, Heyward, California.   Of the ten largest places, San Diego has the largest proportion of Pacific Islanders. So if you only have money to do one study, you should know where to go. Los Angeles, Phoenix, that is the order in which you find the ANHOPIs.   So whether they are classified alone or in combination, there is such a fuss about, how many multiracial, how confusing it is to have multiracial compared to single. However you look at it, you are looking at 73 percent or 76 percent living in the West. It is three-quarters of the population.   Over half of the Pacific Islanders live in just two states. Eighty percent of the ANHOPIs live in just ten states. So if you have the money to go for ten states, go for ten states, but if you don't, go for two states.   What are the other methodological issues that I would like to raise? One is, framing the research questions is very important. Who frames the question, and why is that question being framed the way it is? Because that affects what kinds of answers we get.   Sample size and sampling, research design, rationale for inclusion, eligibility for participation and analysis of data. Framing the question. I will use one study as an example. Scientific naivete, blind compliance with NIH rules about the inclusion of minorities in clinical trials. Difficulty in finding study subjects or a desire to extend equity and access to care, that led to the encouragement of ANHOPI participation in HRT trials in the women's health initiative.   My question, where are the necessary descriptive and symptom prevalence data to justify ANHOPI participation? Do we have any data to show that a large proportion of the baby boomers are suffering from the same kind of menopausal symptoms that white and black women are suffering from, like flushing and I don't know what else, because I did not experience them.   Are clinical trials without supporting data from prevalence and case control studies scientifically defensible and ethically justifiable? Is drugs the only treatment approach for menopausal symptoms, and to many conditions that contribute to ANHOPI health disparities? Is this what we call public health? Is this what public health is all about? Drugs and clinical trials, and drugs and giving drugs to people to control their health conditions.   I'm not putting down drugs. I think under certain conditions, drugs are important. But I think there are preventive measures that we could take that we have largely ignored because many behavioral scientists who enter public health do not have sufficient credentials to question existing practices, or do not have the guts, as I do, and are not afraid of the consequences of losing their jobs when they raise those questions.   Why do ANHOPIs who exercise and maintain a slim body weight in my observation not experience the kinds of menopausal symptoms that are often reported by white and black Americans? Could there be an association?    I'll tell you how this question came through. My doctor told me when I was in my 40s that I had to report to him the moment I felt flushing, and I said, what is flushing? He described to me, you feel someone opened up the oven in front of you and closed it right away. I waited ten years, 11 years, nothing happened. So I went and talked to many older Asian women. I said, have you experienced this? They were living overseas and they said, is this what you learn in American universities? Is that what epidemiology is about? I really want to know, how did you experience menopause? They said, one day I woke up, I found out that I missed it for two months, and that was it. That sentence is repeated over and over again.   Then I talked to American women, and they talked to me about sweating, about flushing, about not being able to sleep, about I don't know what else. I forgot now, I can't remember anymore. I said, are Americans making this up, or what is going on?    So the big discovery came about when I went on a cruise. This was a Yangtze River cruise in China, where half of the passengers happened to be Americans, and half were Chinese from different parts of the world. They were Chinese from Mainland China, Chinese from Hong Kong, Chinese from Taiwan, Chinese from Canada and Chinese from the United States.   On one of those boring days, one of the admirals came up to me and said, we would like you to give a talk, because we found out you are an epidemiologist, and we never know what that is, so can you give us a talk on any topic you want. So I said, what is the topic that American women want to hear about? They said, hormone replacement therapy.   This was May of last year. So I went up and I gave a talk. In the middle of my talk, a Chinese lady asked, what is hormone replacement therapy? She came from Taiwan. The Americans looked so surprised, that this woman never heard of it. So I explained. The next question came from the Chinese, why do American women take it? So I threw that question on the American audience, and they explained they have symptoms. I said, could you please explain the symptoms, and they said, flushing. I translated this, and everybody looked -- then the Americans say, don't they have it? The Chinese said no.   I said, wait, how many Chinese women have it? I asked them to raise their hand. Only one woman raised her hand. That woman was obese. All the other women were slim. So then one Chinese woman said, how many of the American women exercised before they went into menopause? None. Then she said to me in Chinese, don't translate this into English, but don't you think it has to do with their fatness? I said, I wish the researchers were as smart as the lay people in asking these kinds of questions.   I then asked that question when the women's health initiative investigators came to Hopkins to give a talk. The only measure they had was BMI. BMI does not measure percent body fat. I think the critical factor is percent body fat. Estrogen works well when you have body fat, according to the literature that I read. Maybe I am not good enough as an epidemiologist, haven't read enough, but that is what the literature suggests; there is an association between body fat and the beneficial effects of estrogen. So could it be that this is the missing link? Yet, the women's health initiative, according to that talk that I heard, did not collect data on percent body fat. How many million dollars was that study? I don't remember, but it was humongous.   So how a research question is framed determines the direction of research and whether or not we will find answers to the questions.   We need large sample sizes to study Asian American health disparities, sample sizes that will take account of their cultural and linguistic diversities. The CHIS has always been mentioned as something that has fulfilled that dream, because they have a very large sample size.    My issue with the CHIS, and it is not personal, it is scientific, is that because that sample size was achieved by over sampling, you end up getting more of the same people. So the data are correlated, so you are not getting the full range of variability you should be getting from the full range of variability you should be getting from the population.   We need core health surveys in ANHOPI languages, through special Congressional appropriations, in the same way that the NHANES in Hispanic was funded, in the same way that the NHIS is funded, CPS is funded, women's health initiative is funded. We need those studies. We cannot work around that issue. We have to really take the bull by the horn and face it and work towards that goal.   We should also consider alternative study designs in the meantime. Surveys in selected health plans like Kaiser Permanente in the West Coast, Oxford Health Plans in the East Coast. There are some new health plans emerging because of the mergers of several health plans now. We should really focus on those settings to collect data, because there, primary access to care has been controlled. Everybody has insurance, or they wouldn't be there. So now, given that everybody has their health insurance, how well are they being treated, given they have the same coverage now?   We need to ask that question. There are not enough studies on that.   We need case control study designs. Since we can find all the cases, what we need now is to find our controls. We need case cohort study designs. We have large scale surveys that supply you with a cohort of small numbers of Asian Americans, but nevertheless a cohort. Now how about considering case cohort study designs?   We need coordinated multi-site population focused surveys. Because Asian Americans are concentrated in only selected areas, how about picking investigators from those areas and make them all meet together regularly, consider standardizing survey questionnaires, consider training them to do research and collect data. And to follow-back mortality surveys. We have done that at NCHS. We have so many follow-back surveys on white and black infants; how about on Asian Pacific Islanders in selected areas? We need to encourage collaborations between researchers beyond one's own institution, because that is the only way we are going to get large enough numbers of Asian American subjects.   Another important methodologic issue is the question of inclusion. Do the inclusion criteria that currently limit participation to English-speaking persons, for example, in the national health interview survey and the national health and nutrition surveys conducted by NCHS, do these surveys restrict the participation of Asian Americans, by the simple fact that they only have English language instruments available.   Does the Fourteenth Amendment not require that routine health surveys be conducted in a language that would allow equal participation of ANHOPIs? I talked to some lawyers. I took a course on public health and law at Hopkins, and it was an eye-opener when the law professor says, yes, under the Fourteenth Amendment you can push for health surveys for Asian Americans. That is one of the best courses I took at Hopkins. I told that professor, I wish you would offer one more: how to develop health policies, because I would be there. They said, you have to be a lawyer. I said, there more years and $90,000; I don't have it.   What are my recommendations for research? Minimum recommendation, two super funded multi-site surveys in AAPI languages through Congressional appropriations, one focused on chronic diseases, cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, substance abuse and depression. Why? Because they have common risk factors.   Two, infectious diseases, vaccine preventable diseases. There is no excuse for Asian Americans not to get the vaccines they need when these vaccines are available. It is simply that we did not reach out to them, that the mainstream society's medical care system did not get to them, and the question is, why the dickens they did not get to them.   Current state of data collection. Government surveys are the only source of large scale national data on ANHOPIs. NCHS is a major player here. California is a major potential source. The problem is that trained ANHOPI epidemiologists are not involved from conception to writeup. They are invited sometimes as consultants. They are spoken to before the proposal was submitted. Their name might even appear. But when the grant comes in, they were not told, they were not invited in the planning, they were not included.   Then when data analysis comes, they might be invited to the later planning meeting, but really, how the authorship will be divided was never discussed. So would you get involved, if you don't know how much time you should be putting in, and you are being held accountable by your employer about your travel time?    Hawaii is another major source, but again, it is too far away, and the question is, how do we gain access to those data?   Some data exists from routine government sponsored surveys and investigator funded studies, but the numbers are small and the confidence intervals are very wide. Most epidemiologists, and I would say all schools of public health are not trained to analyze data that are not normally distributed. All your statistics classes talk about normal distribution. You have to be a biostat major to take non-parametric statistics. We are not trained to analyze highly correlated data and data that are difficult to bridge with other data sets. We all know we need SUDAN, but when you go to RTI, SUDAN gives you lessons for two days. After that, you're on your own, and you have many questions and you can't answer them, and you don't know where to go.   Now, here is the bombshell. I am a full professor, tenured, and I say that universities are archaic. For minority health, for ANHOPI minority health, universities are archaic, and I'll explain why.   Many of the intellectual resources at universities are unfamiliar with minority health research issues. You would be lucky if you can find three persons outside of California, and I don't know about California, I even question California, let's just say outside California to be on the safe side from attacks, that outside of California, you would be lucky if you can find three professors who know anything about ANHOPI minority health issues to form a dissertation committee. If you cannot have that committee, how can students write their dissertations on that topic? Very few of those professors would even know how to approach the issue of minority health, especially for ANHOPIs. They know about blacks, they don't know about Latinos, they don't know about ANHOPIs.   Very few of those universities, no matter how much money they have, will be able to employ a critical mass of minority researchers as faculty members without suffering repercussions.   I sat on recruitment committees where the first sentence uttered by the chairman is, here is the ground rules. If we have two candidates of equal qualifications, one is white and one is Asian, we will vote for the white. This is the recruitment committee. I am on that committee. It is five to one. Should I vote against or for it? Do I squeal? Do you think I will get anywhere if I squeal?   This is the reality of universities. They do not truly educate or train minority health researchers to become leaders and decision makers. They train them to become very good computer data analysts. They are pigeonholed into those positions. They are considered not good enough if they don't know their SAS. If you spend your whole life doing SAS, you miss the big picture. You miss the policy issues.   On the other hand, people say, aren't there ANHOPI professors in the academic setting? Yes, there are. They are burdened with non-minority committee work. They are burdened with teaching courses that are not minority health courses, because there are not enough students interested in minority health. They are mentoring students that have language problems.   Any student that has a language problem is inevitably assigned to me, as if I speak so many languages. I do, but not that many. They have a heavy teaching load. Their courses are changed more frequently than for other groups of professors, and they have a hard time getting release time.    They have low wages. What is the average salary for a professor at many universities. This was about five years ago when I looked at the data. $60,000 a year. I think a truck driver makes more money than that.    Community involvement and public health practices are seldom regarded as productive work. These are the problems with minorities working in the setting of universities, and that is why I say, if you are serious about minority health research, especially for ANHOPIs, universities would be the last place to give you the infrastructure you need to do that kind of work.   My suggestion is the creation of an ANHOPI policy research institute, which would transcend university walls, transcend community organizations that now exist, and transcend the ANHOPI clinics that now exist, but working with all of them. It would provide a permanent setting for internships to students that are scattered at the top universities, that want to do ANHOPI research, but cannot find mentors. Fellowships to health professionals, and promote collaboration among researchers and students, and address cutting edge research and policy issues, where Ph.D levels and doctorate levels of researchers are needed, not just master's level. Develop and maintain the ANHOPI data banks jointly with government agencies like NCHS, Census and CDC.   What are the components of the institute? It needs an advocacy arm, which means that this institute should maintain some kind of relationship with the forum. It needs clinics, which means that it should have a working relationship with APCHO. It needs research, which means that it should link with many of the ANHOPI faculties, and oftentimes there is only one of them in every department, not every department, but one of them in some of the departments of epidemiology throughout the 30-some schools of public health in the United States.   We should do demonstration, by linking researchers in the community through public health lectures, continuing education and practices. Therefore, it should get the media involved. There are more than a thousand alternative media in the United States; they should be involved here.   Legislative arm should develop policies. It should work with lawyers. There is an Asian American network of lawyers, and it should have ties to the U.S. Congress, the Senate, the Justice Department and the White House.   What are the requisites for such a policy research institute? It should be fiscally independent from universities. It should have its own grants and contracts management office, its own IRB, its own permanent grounds or campus, it should have research facilities, and it should hold weekly seminars on ANHOPI policy issues. It should have permanent and visiting researchers.   I was quite surprised some years ago when my leave for absence was approved without pay. I approached the forum and I said, may I spend a year doing research with your data sets, and the answer I got was, no, we don't have such a mechanism to absorb you. Yet, the forum said they have the data and they have no researchers.   So basically, the issue is a bread and butter issue for many of the community organizations. They are concerned that if they absorb these Ph.D researchers, they will be the ones to get all the grants, and that the forum would end up with no grants. What they don't realize is that these researchers run only after certain grants. For our promotion and tenure, only certain grants would help us in our career. Some other grants would not help us in our career. It is like two persons with left shoes to sell cannot have a business, but if one person has a left shoe and one person has a right shoe, then the Chinese say, yu can have a business. One or the other can buy the other out, and then you can walk with two pairs of shoes.   That is really what the forum is and what researchers are. One has the left shoe, the other has the right shoe, but somehow they haven't been put together, they haven't even communicated. Yet, I was one of the persons that contributed to the creation of the forum at a San Francisco meeting many years ago. We voted for it, we were very much in favor for it. Many researchers were very much in favor for it. But after it was established, many researchers were alienated by not being included, and the question is, why? We are not fighting for the same pot of money. Why not? Work together.   ANHOPI policy research will require prior agreement with independent investigators about data ownership and procedures for data analysis and co-authorships. That system has to be developed. It will fill a gap in the training of minority scientists at all major U.S. educational institutions. I get calls from students at leading universities saying, they want to do a thesis on Asian Americans. They cannot find a single professor who even understood what they were talking about.   It will insure a cohort of researchers whose interest in ANHOPI health research will not be trivialized by the institution that employed them. I get questions like, so you did a report for CMS on Asian American health disparities. What good is it to us? What good is it to our colleagues or all white Americans? I don't know how to answer that question. That was the question posed to me. You've got a 600-page report; what benefit do we the university get out it? You tell me how I should answer that, because I don't know, and that is being posed to me.   Efficient use of resources. We have all the data, and we can collect better and more data, but where do we put them? To try to hope that one single investigator can be your big P.I. and collect all that data, I can tell you, Hopkins is full of professors who have storages with data, boxes and boxes of data. I hear this from all the Hopkins master's students. They have a fear of entering those storage because they say, we can't find them, and you are supposed to sort them out to get your dissertation or thesis done. I have storage of data. I am paying $150 a month for data that are sitting in storage. It is too much of a burden to put on a single individual to hold all those data, because you will get moved. Your office gets moved, your residence gets moved, your employer changes over time. You move those data with you, but you don't really know what to do with them. We need to really seriously address that issue.    We need to be able to make timely response to policy health research. We now have a cohort of ANHOPI scientists who are retiring or who have just recently retired. Many of them are very talented and mentally alert and technically very competent. It is a non-diminishing intellectual resource, because there will be many more coming up. How about recruiting them as potential mentors and researchers for this health policy research institute that I am dreaming about?    Many of them have talked to me, and we have talked about this idea. We just did not know how to get it funded, how to get it off the ground.   A question of accountability of the institute. You have a board of directors, you have management teams. You have a process of selection. You develop your transfer of power. Systems of management have to be developed, and the system will manage the people. Your board of directors will comprise of scientists, of community people and of management personnel. You have joint publications with funding agencies. That would hold accountability, that would make sure that the data are published, and the funding agency would have a copy of the data set, so you don't have a fought issue here.   Many of the data that are now being released by NCHS, and I have seen some publications coming out of famous ANHOPI professors, and I shall not mention their name, where they show the data, the paper is published. The numbers showed that the confidence intervals overlap. The sentence said significant difference, and I wrote to the author and I said, how could you say there is a significant difference when in fact there is not? Clearly that is community pressure to establish a significant difference when the data does not bear it out.   So accountability has to come from two sources. You have to be accountable to the community, but you also have to be accountable to the scientific community, or else you lose your credibility.   What has happened in the past is that those in the academic setting who are working with a community have great credibility in the community, but lack credibility in the scientific community, because their publications constantly show data that contradict the words that they say in the paper.   Then you have those who are overly cautious, who say only what the data allow you to say, and then the community attack them because they did not say enough to favor the community in their grantsmanship. But really, we have two audience here, and we have two accountability to make here one, one to the scientific community, one to the lay community. They have to be consistent, because data are data and they don't lie.   Health advocacy. We need to fund public-private collaboration with ANHOPI specific networks of social service agencies, including voluntary organizations, alternative media, legal or journalistic associations to promote health, to publicize ANHOPI health risks, to encourage participation in intervention programs and use of screening tests.   Education. This is another bombshell that I am dropping. We need a paradigm shift in how we educate public health students. The Policy Research Institute should work with public health students to prepare ANHOPI specific health communication materials in a language that they can understand as part of the culminating experience for graduation for MPH programs. This ought to be part of the culminating health experience.   What we have done as American educational institutions is, we take all these minority students that come in, but we really did not use the language and cultural resources that they have to benefit the community. Instead, we educate them, we taught them about how to study white populations. They come out, they know nothing about how to study minority populations.   The Policy Research Institute should offer courses on indigenous diet and nutrition, because that could never be offered in a university setting. It is so difficult to get courses approved or changed in a university setting. And promote culturally enriching physical health as part of the core public health education and practice in addition to applied behavioral science, medical epidemiology and biostatistics expertise.   So what is needed? A major donor to donate large tracts of land, like NIH started out with a donor who donated tracks of land over a period of years. We need federal funding initially for seed money to create the institute for five to seven years, and then in preparation for self sufficiency at the end of that period, and we need commitment from both the scientific and the lay communities.   That is all.   DR. MAYS: Great, thank you. Here is what we are going to do, because we are running behind in terms of lunch. We are supposed to do health, so I don't want the committee falling out.   DR. YU: Sorry to go on so long.   DR. MAYS: That's okay. Here is what we are going to do, because I know Elena can also be with us this afternoon. Why don't we take a few questions now, and then we are going to adjourn. Then we can continue the questions both from the members as well as the audience after lunch.   So let's start with Eugene.   DR. LENGERICH: This may be a straightforward question, but I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your ideas around the urban-rural origins and growing up and how you measure that; is that a self report, what sort of ways to you assess that information.   DR. YU: There have been questions. In one of the health surveys that I did for some service agencies in Chicago, we did develop a good set of questions on that.   What we did was ask them, before you were age 21, in what kind of community did you spend most of your life, whether it is a small village, a town. Then we had some predefined number of the population, and is it the capital of your country, because the capital of many developing countries is the prime city.     If you go to Beijing, China, yu go to Taipei, it is like living in New York. But if you are outside of that prime city, all the other areas is a very far cry from that city in terms of lifestyle, in terms of exposure to Western values, exposure to Western science and medicine.    So I do believe they affect your ability to deal with bureaucracy and public health. The medical care system in this country is a bureaucracy, and it affects whether or not you are able to be aggressive and assertive, whether you seek a very personalized relationship.   Latinos have a concept called personalismo, meaning to say, you relate to people on a personal basis and you take things very personally. If you come from rural areas, you are more likely to be that type of person, which then says something about difficulties that you might have when you get treated by a nurse today that is not there when you go next time, and then you have to repeat your story to this nurse again. You don't quite know how to talk on the phone about your health problems to people.   So that to me is a very relevant issue. There are ways to develop those questions. Fortunately for that health survey that we did, for the community, the questions were excellent. The community forced me to limit the sample size to 150, because they thought 100 was good enough, and so 150 is already very good. What they did not realize is that I could do very little with 150. I argued with them about increasing it to 300, so that you have a five percent error. It is very difficult.   So this is the problem with working with the communities when it comes down to sample size and resources. You don't have the resources. You may have excellent questions; you can't do anything with that data afterwards.   DR. MAYS: Nancy.   DR. BREEN: I wanted to first off thank you very much for a very marvelous, provocative presentation to this committee. I think it was very, very helpful in terms of helping us think through this issue. We have been grappling with this. This is our second hearing on this topic, so we are really looking for new ways to think about it. So thank you very much for giving us some new ways to start to think about it.   One thing I wanted to follow up on now is, you mentioned the California health interview survey. California is very rich in Asians; we have seen that all morning. Currently what is being done is, the sample is based on the different counties, and then there is a list sample in order to get over sampling among certain Asian groups that aren't going to naturally occur in order to get an adequate sample size.   Did you have some alternative ways of going about getting adequate sample sizes without perhaps using the list, or have yu thought about how you would approach that?   DR. YU: Yes.   DR. BREEN: Could you share with us a bit how you might approach that?   DR. YU: Yes. Some years ago I did work with Paul Levy at Illinois. I was there at the same time Ho Tran was there at the University of Illinois. As you know, Paul Levy is a very famous sampling statistician. He wrote the book, Survey Sampling, that most public health students are exposed to.   We actually developed a sampling design that we were going to write up, but never did, because I was too busy and he was too busy, then I went to Hopkins, and that further delayed me. I'm blaming someone now for my own negligence in writing it up.   DR. BREEN: It may not be too late.   DR. YU: The concept is this, very quickly. Pick your census tracts with say 20 percent or more Asian Americans. Go down, pick your blocks with 20 percent or more Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and then do the hard legwork of canvassing door to door.   Once you get canvassing door to door, you would be able to establish which household has how many Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, which household does not. You can supplement this approach with a reverse directory that gives you all the addresses at that location, so you know you are not missing the households. With the reverse directory, you have the address and the name of the householder. Some Asians who married white would not have an Asian last name. You can do a sensitivity/specificity analysis, based on surnames; how many would you have missed and how many would you have really identified as truly Asian.   So once you define the geographic boundary against which to do these studies, it is doable. Actually, Paul and I were going to write it up, but we never did. The reason in part was because most of the grants mechanism do not allow you sufficient space to write such a detailed sampling plan. It is extremely difficult to get such a paper published just solely on sampling, on how to sample it.   So we ended up talking about it but never writing it. But I felt that is probably the closest and best method we have of using the census data to do sampling of Asian Americans.   DR. BREEN: Can I ask a followup to that? One of the reasons I have heard that the list sampling is used is, it is relatively cheap and considered adequate. Do you have a sense of the cost of this? It sounds like it is a fairly expensive procedure.   DR. YU: Yes, it is. In fact, when I presented this concept at a meeting, it was a Gerontological Society of America meeting. At that time I was thinking of just studying elderly Asian Americans, but this sampling method could be applied to any group or any topic you want.   Westat was there. When Westat asked me the question, how much do you think it will cost -- and Paul and I worked out the numbers, and we figured at that time for a sample size of 2,000 that we could do it -- this was in the mid '90s -- that we could do it for a million, and Westat said, I wouldn't do it for two millions.   Yes, cost is a problem, but did cost bother us when we did the women's health initiative? Why is it that cost is always a stumbling block when we are doing studies of Asian Americans? We always say it costs too much. What costs too much is relative to what we think that data is worth.   I think that good data on ANHOPIs is worth billions right now, because they can open up keys to many questions, research questions, critical substantive research questions about majority Americans that we have never entertained. The example is menopausal symptoms. Had we studied Asian Americans in a much earlier era and gathered enough descriptive data, we would probably have been guided into a different direction of research to supplement the kind of research that emphasizes only drugs. We would probably have gone into physical exercise and looked at physical exercise and menopausal symptoms instead of looking only at drugs.   How do you explain otherwise, that of the seven studies in this whole world on diagnosed diabetes and exercise, only two were conducted in the United States? Given all the resources of NIH, given all the talented people coming to the United States to study, and all the high powered clinical trials that you have? No one thought of doing a good clinical trial on diagnosed diabetes and exercise.   These two U.S. studies were very poorly done. One was in San Diego, the other one was in Pittsburgh. They were not long enough, and they were conducted 12 to 15 years ago. How do you explain that? How do you explain that, with all the money we got? That is a mind boggler to me. I just can't understand it.   DR. BREEN: One more followup and then I'll stop. It sounds like you might have figured out how to answer your colleagues' question about what good was that CMS study that you did on Asians.    DR. YU: I don't know how to answer. I'm supposed to write on it.   DR. BREEN: I think you just did. But also, you mentioned a number of steps that you developed in your data sampling strategy. We might want to start with a little scaled down version. It strikes me that there were some steps that would still provide better data than a list sample, while not being maybe quite the Cadillac that you just described, we could do a Honda Accord or something, that that might be possible.   DR. YU: Yes. In fact, actually I had a graduate student work with me on that. We looked at San Diego County's census tracts, and then we identified the blocks with 20 percent or more Filipinos. At that time we were developing a Filipino cancer screening study. Then we got down to every level, just picked 20 percent of every level, and finally we got down to the boundaries, the streets that defined the census blocks, and then we used the reverse directory to identify the streets and the households within those blocks. Then we went down into houses and did a canvassing of houses.   They did this 30 years ago with studies of whites and blacks in this country. Why is it they are refusing to do it for Asian Americans in this country at this time? Given all the computer technologies that we have? This is something I cannot understand.   DR. BREEN: I think that is a very feasible way to go about it though, don't you?   DR. YU: Yes, definitely   DR. MAYS: I think there are some other sampling questions, there are a couple I want to ask, but I think we are going to hold those and continue some questions before we proceed into some other deliberations.   I want to thank you for the time and effort that you put into your presentation to bring us some of the most up to date information. Even though I just heard you present in September, again you have done even more work, so I want to say on behalf of the committee I really appreciate, particularly given the short time line you had, the information that you pulled together and the thoughtfulness that you presented in order to give us an overview, and also as well a set of recommendations to consider. So thank you very much.   What I would suggest is that we adjourn for lunch before I have to scoop people out of these chairs here. Let's come back at about 2:15.   (The meeting recessed for lunch at 1:05 p.m., to reconvene at 2:20 p.m.)   A F T E R N O O N S E S S I O N (2:20 p.m.)   DR. MAYS: We are returning back from our lunch break, and we are going to be continuing with questions and answers to our previous presenter, Dr. Elena Yu.     Again, I'll repeat, if you want to call in, the phone number is 877-939-8305. Then you need to know the participant code, which is 278561.   Let me take questions first from the members, and then we will open it up more broadly. These are questions for Dr. Yu. Nancy is claiming her time.   DR. BREEN: I had another one. Dr. Yu, you mentioned that -- I hope you remember the context, because I'm not sure I can reproduce it. But you talked about multiple axes of classification. Does that ring a bell?   DR. YU: Yes.   DR. BREEN: Could you talk about what you were thinking of, talk a little more about that?   DR. YU: We are so accustomed to think of classifying ANHOPIs the way the OMB has told us to do so, that is, the population is white Americans, black Americans and then ANHOPIs, and to also divide it along quote-unquote ethnicity, which means Latino or non-Latino.   As a result, many of the standard health surveys that the government routinely collects would get this information. What I am saying is that this information may not be sufficient to do many of the health analyses that we need to do, and to also target special groups for services. We need to supplement these questions with additional questions about where they were born, nativity, generation in the U.S., where the parents were born, because once you ask where the parents were born, if they tell you that the parents were born in the United States, you know that this person that you are talking to is a second generation.    We need to ask questions about level of education, and we also should ask questions about rural/urban origin. I do believe that that really affects your ability to adapt to modern bureaucracies, as I mentioned earlier.    So this list of non-genetic confounders that I showed on my slides are the additional questions that should go into every survey. If we could do that, then the imprecision in the measurement of race and ethnicity is in some ways actually already improved. It would help us target certain groups better for services. It would help us to identify the high-risk groups. That may be a solution to this problem of how do we measure and classify the different minority groups to meet the objectives of Healthy People 2010.   DR. BREEN: Thank you.   DR. MAYS: Suzanne.   DR. HEURTIN-ROBERTS: Dr. Yu, you and the speakers before you mentioned a little bit about translating surveys into various languages. Could you also comment on -- or just give me your thoughts on the issue of cultural equivalency of survey items, because I think it is more than a language issue.     DR. YU: I am glad you asked that question. My presentation does not -- the time allotted to me does not give me enough time to really address the issue of language. I myself speak about seven languages, just by accident of being born in a certain setting, in a certain educational situation. I could understand the complexity of the issues.   Let me describe to you how I dealt with it in a study I did, which was a pilot project funded by NCI on cancer control among Asian Americans. At that time, we were working on only two groups, the Chinese and the Koreans in Chicago. What we did was, for the Chinese part -- because when you say Chinese, the main language groups in the U.S. are Mandarin speakers, Cantonese speakers and Taiwanese speakers, and then you have a fourth group, Shonghanese speakers.    When you say Koreans however, it is more or less, compared to the Chinese, a uniform group. There might be slight changes in accent, intonation, but it is really one language, so it is a lot easier to work with.    So what we did was, I had a Korean co-P.I. We entered into an agreement that all the Korean studies, she would be the lead author and I would contribute in terms of substance, but I would not know the language or the culture as well as she did, because she was raised as a Korean. For all the Chinese part, I am in charge. She would contribute what she knows about the Koreans and ask questions whether it would apply to the Chinese part.   For the Chinese translation part, what we did was, we had translators in the U.S. who are from these different groups work on a translation from the NCHS version of a cancer control questionnaire. But I also contacted professional translators in Hong Kong to get me the Cantonese version. There is going to be a slight difference in the way the language is used in Hong Kong versus the Cantonese speakers in this country. We compared those differences, we discussed them.   So it is doable. In other words, we worry so much in this country, since it is so monolingual, about all the different language versions and all that, but people outside of the United States live with multiple languages, grew up with multiple languages. It is no problem. It is a question of, are you willing to invest the resources, and are you willing to go through the rigorous process of translation, back translation, and hours of meetings to iron out all the nuances of the different words and different meanings.   Clearly, people who speak multiple languages know that a literal translation is a very poor way of establishing equivalence. What you really need to get out is the meaning behind the words. They know how to do it. We had four different versions of a translation of an instrument, and then we would compare all four f them and say, why are we seeing these differences and what is the meaning.     Then we would pilot test it. We did the pilot test on it. We interview people with it and say, why did you give me the answer that you gave me? This is probing. You do what is known as a think-aloud method; how did you get at this answer, what was your understanding of the word we just used. That way, you know exactly where the problem is. But it is labor intensive.   But we have done this. NCHS did this kind of study, applying cognitive psychology strategies to serve the questions. They have done this on white populations, why are we so unwilling to do it on ANHOPIs? When you say it costs so much, it really reflects a value judgment that you don't think it is worth doing, it is worth the cost. But I think we need to change that prejudice in our mind set about the worthiness of studying these populations, because they might contribute something substantive to science.   DR. HUERTIN-ROBERTS: Thank you.   DR. MAYS: Other questions? Russell.   MR. LOCALIO: I have one question you may be able to help us with. One of your slides had the estimated population of certain groups by city, and some of the cities that had the largest number of people in various groups.   Now, in your opinion, if one were to try to find these various subgroups, is the issue of differences among the subgroups more important than differences among the cities within one subgroup? Depending on your answer, how do you deal with that problem?   DR. YU: That is a very, very good question. I think it all depends on what you want to study, what is the research question. If you are talking about factors behind uninsurance, I think the group differences are not so critical, as to the reasons why they are not insured. There are reasons why a lot of AAPIs are not insured. They are associated with factors associated with non-insurance. That is to say, they are employed in small firms with less than 500 employees. They cannot afford to provide the insurance to these people.     There are certain factors, and it depends on what yu are looking at. If I am looking at the percentage of ANHOPIs who have not used cancer screening tests, I think that AAPI as a group are low users of cancer screening tests. AAPI as a group are highly vulnerable and have a very high prevalence of hepatitis-B virus. So group differences are not so great if you compare the AAPI groups versus white.   But there are certain other kinds of health issues where inter-group differences might be very important. In that case, within the AAPI groups, some groups -- if you look at obesity, I would say that that problem is much more dominant among the Native Hawaiians, among the Samoans. If you are talking about oversized babies, babies born that are weighing too heavy, that problem does occur more prevalently among Native Hawaiians and Samoans than say among Japanese or Chinese.    So it depends on what you are looking at. We need to target our sample and sampling strategy to the problem, instead of trying to come up with one sampling strategy for all types of research questions. We don't do that in our studies of white Americans, why do we want to do that in our studies of AAPIs?     DR. MAYS: We asked a question about methodological issues. I want to come back to that. I think part of what happens is that it is very easy for us to recommend those surveys. Then what happens is, it isn't until somebody is in the middle of it and they say, oh my gosh, we have to do this, we have to -- so part of what I think would be useful as we struggle with what some of the issues are is to try beforehand and highlight what is different and why it is necessary to do that.   Can you talk about -- you can do it either as specific or general, as the knowledge base is there to do it. What is different that causes us to have to use a different set of methods?   For example, if there are within ANHOPI populations households that have three generations of family in that, what does that mean relative to for example our ability to be able to do enumerations? What are some of the issues that are different, that if we sit down and try and come up with strategies that we should be paying attention to for ANHOPI populations to be specific, methodological differences, and there are differences that occur as a result of something about the population?   DR. YU: That is a very good question, and it is extremely broad. I could group my answers into different segments.   First of all, the implication for a large household size for AAPIs compared to non-whites, in terms of applications. Then I'll come back and talk about the methodology issues.    It means that if we miss that one household of three generations, we are missing a sizeable segment of the population, because you are missing a lot of people in that one household. It is not like the white American population, that the average size is 1.2 persons, for example. If you miss that, no big deal, there is another 1.2 person household. But with the AAPI, if you miss that household, you are missing four to nine people right there. That means that if you have a vaccination program, you are missing all these people that you should have been vaccinating.   It also has some opportunities here, because that means that if you are successful in reaching out to them, to the AAPI households, you are hitting all nine of them, from the youngest to the oldest all at once. So there is an advantage to knowing that AAPIs have a very large household size, because they have implications for public health education, they have implications for prevention measures.   Now, in terms of sampling, it means that we need to go back and think. I don't know how many of you know James Jackson. I was a graduate student and I admired him terribly at the time, because he was in my mind the first black American scientist trained as a behavior scientist, who was funded to do the black American family study. This was in the 1980s.   We were just in awe. I said, God, it would be great if one day we could have such a study of the Asian Americans. So we tried to -- I read many of James Jackson's work, I attended many of his seminars, and I was just very much wanting to have such a study done on Americans.   What did he do? He canvassed door to door in Detroit. Why is it that we can accept that when it comes to a study of black Americans, but we cannot accept the idea of canvassing door to door when we are doing studies of ANHOPIs? This is something I cannot understand.    We do need to do that, because we need to have that primary enumeration process in order to know how many people are there, in order to be able to apply the sampling methods of using a table of random numbers that we are taught in our biostatistics classes to do.   So I think it is very important methodologically to have to go through that process, to pay for the cost of doing it, as we have done 40 years ago, 50 years ago, for studies of white Americans, 20 years ago for studies of black Americans. We should be able to do that for ANHOPIs. The technology is there, the knowledge is there. The question is, are we willing to put our money where our mouth is.   I hope I answered the question.   DR. MAYS: Yes, and I have one followup. It is funny, because it actually comes from my experience. I was a postdoc at the program for research on black Americans at ISR at Michigan with James, and you're right, they were among the first to actually do such a survey.   One of the things that they did is, they called it the three-gen study; they had a three-generational study. The problem is that despite having this wonderful three-gen data, it is like the statistical techniques to do these three-generational data haven't progressed quite as quickly. I think now we are a little bit better off, because I think the developmental life span people have worked on it.   But that becomes another issue, whether or not there are differences in terms of -- a different need in terms of statistical techniques, in terms of working in a population, when you have some of the complexity of issues that you have.   For example, going into the household, and you have three generations in the household. You collect data on those three generations in the household, and yu don't analyze it -- you shouldn't be analyzing it the same way.    So I am wondering if you have given some thought about what even some of the other statistical needs might be, given the complexity of some of the issues in this population.   DR. YU: I am not a statistician, I need to qualify my answers to that, but I do as an epidemiologist look at substantive issues. I think that there are ways to slice the data.   For example, in a three-generation family, if I were to analyze the data, I would like to see the cultural shifts, or the extent to which different degrees of cultural integration in the United States affect health care and access to health.   With the Asian American families compared to other families, I would suspect that having younger generations in the family who speak English would help and would be of benefit to older generations, because they are the ones that would broker the contact of the seniors with the health care system. They are the ones that actually act as translators. This is what some ANHOPIs call an ethnic tax. That is to say, hospitals and physicians do not provide translators, and put the burden of translation on the youngest family member of the AAPI families, who then have to take the elderly to the doctor and take the translation, and they are not always the best translators.   You have two issues here. You have the confidentiality issue involved, and then you have the problem of proficiency. Just because the guy looked Asian and is born in an Asian family doesn't mean that he speaks the Asian language fluently as a translator would have. So this is what in the minority community they call an ethnic tax, that no other ethnic groups are ever burdened with that responsibility, to act as translator, but the ANHOPI families are burdened with that problem.   So I think there are ways to look at the data. You can use the household as your unit of analysis and look at the data differently. You can cut the data and look at just the oldest generation, the third generation, the second generation and the first generation, and you can compare between groups, and I'm sure that if you have the funding for it, that there will be biostatisticians who would come up with new methods of analyzing the data. The question is, are you willing to put the money up for it.   DR. MAYS: Thank you. Any other questions among the committee? Edna and then Virginia.   DR. PAISANO: To follow up with that question, I don't know whether you or one of the previous speakers talked about intermarriage, either among other Asian groups or the Pacific Islanders with whites.   I guess part of my question is, if you are looking at a sample and you are trying to classify a household as one of the Asians or one of the Pacific Islanders. Either the husband or the wife or the spouse or the householder, one is non-Asian, do you still consider that an Asian household or a Pacific Islander household?   DR. YU: That is a very good question. I think that the answer to that question should depend on the research topic and the purpose of research. You could define them as being included or as being excluded.   The multiracial households, the households that became multiracial because of marriage, can be classified either way. What we should do, we should always include a methodological piece of research into every survey we are doing with ANHOPIs in order to measure the sensitivity and specificity of your classification method in actually locating the AAPIs.   Unfortunately, we do not have a blackboard here, or I could illustrate it with you. If you think of a two by two table, you could define for example your ANHOPI household as any household that contains at least one person who is an ANHOPI, or you could define it as any household that contains at least two persons that are ANHOPI.   Now, you could vary that number. Whatever your classification method is, that is your classification method. On the other side of the dimension, you could say, when you knocked on a household, what did you find, and limit your sampling to cell A or cell A and B or cell A, B and C or A, B, C, D, whatever, and then calculate your sensitivity and specificity from there. That would tell you how good you are at classifying your populations.   I know that if you were studying the Japanese, interracial marriage rates are very high. If you are studying the Native Hawaiians, interracial marriage is very high. If you are studying the Cambodians, if you are studying Koreans, inter-marriage rate is relatively low, compared to other ANHOPI groups. So it really depends on which subgroup you are studying, what is the critical issue here, and what is your research question.   Even if you look at my family alone, I have relatives who are African Americans, who marry African Americans. I have a distant nephew who is half black and half Chinese. I have relatives who are half Jewish and half Chinese and half Portuguese. So if you look far enough at any of the Asian American families, you will find that many of them are multiracial. The question is, what are you looking at, what questions are you asking.   It depends. It depends on your research problem, and we should stop thinking of a one size fits all approach to the study of ANHOPIs. We should be explicit about how we are classifying them, but that allows us to take the findings into account, take the methodology of collecting the data into account as we interpret the findings.   I hope I have answered your question?   DR. PAISANO: Yes.   DR. MAYS: Virginia?   DR. CAIN: In your presentation, you had suggested that there are a lot of data sets out there of the ANHOPI population, but that they are not accessible to people, they are stored in basements or something.    DR. STEINWACHS: They are in the Hopkins basement.   DR. CAIN: They are all in the Hopkins basement. Is there any reason that they aren't archived at places like ICPSR or someplace else, and are there things that could be done to make them accessible to other researchers?   DR. YU: Let me clarify myself. There are some AAPI data, not a lot compared to other groups. The data that we have were collected before the computer technology overpowered our whole society. So many of those data were collected on -- they were saved on CD's, but we have a compactability issue. They were saved during the days when the Wang was still existing.   DR. CAIN: Oh, wow.   DR. YU: Remember the Wang has the word processor?   DR. STEINWACHS: I'm not that old.   DR. YU: Remember Wordstar? Did anybody ever hear of Wordstar?   DR. MAYS: Yes, I remember that.   DR. YU: And the code book was written in Wordstar. The problem with those data is that we have no way to convert them, or it would take so much effort to convert them into Word Perfect or Word, it would take so much effort to find the code book. There are those datas. They are in the hands of individual investigators in the days before we even knew about data banks.   ISR is a very good institution, and has really developed a standard method of cleaning up data, making them publicly accessible. Unfortunately, many of these data that are in the hands of individual investigators are in self storage. Right now, if you were to ask these investigators to bring them out, documenting them would be very difficult, unless you are willing to pay for their time. There is no way to salvage those data anymore. If they were not published, they are gone forever.   However, there are a minimum amount of data coming out of NCHS surveys. The vital statistics record for example is an excellent source. That is where I got most of my data on mortality. Those data have not been thoroughly written up. I think I am probably one of the few in the country that started to write this up because of CMS asking me to write a report on Medicaid and Medicare for ANHOPIs, so I had to review the data. I wrote it up. I haven't published them even, and I should be, but how could I when I have my dissertation to worry about? This is the demand on my time.   DR. STEINWACHS: One must have priorities.   DR. YU: I don't have two heads, I can't ride two horses. So when I say there is plenty of data, plenty in a very relative sense. There is not absolutely no data, there is some data. The question is, how do we get them written up, how do we get them analyzed.   NCHS has NHIS data, but the problem with those data sets is that the Asians are classified as one big group. Even if you pull data for different years, you don't get a large enough sample to do analysis by different stratified groups. So there is that problem.    I am saying that we cannot continue the same practice year after year. We have to start thinking outside of the box, and the solution is really population focused surveys.   Did I answer your question?   DR. CAIN: Yes, to a certain extent. One of the things that I am wondering though is, is it worthwhile to try and retrieve some of those data sets that you are talking about, even if it requires an investment of money in standardizing them or bringing them up to current standards?   DR. YU: It depends on the investigator. Again, if you were to fund them, would they be able to bring them up, would they be able to supply the documentation for it. That we don't know, unless we have a master list of all the investigators who are funded to do AAPI studies we wouldn't know.   But for example, Kaiser Permanente has collected data on Asian Americans. You can identify Chinese, Filipinos and Native Hawaiians from their data set. The question is, as an individual investigator, if you ask me today, you say Elena, I'm going to fund you to analyze Kaiser Permanente data, I don't know who in Kaiser Permanente I would contact to get that data set. Not that I haven't tried.   We talk about Northern California Cancer Center. I have called them. Do you know what the answer I got was when I called them and said I wanted to analyze their cancer data? They said, somebody is already doing it. Two years later I met that somebody. I shall not mention the name. The person said, I didn't do it because I didn't get funded.   This is the kind of treatment we get. So it makes it very ineffective for us to analyze the data. We don't know -- I come from a small city, rural background, it makes a difference. I don't know how to access the bureaucracy to analyze the data. That is why my suggestion is, we need a policy research institute that administratively will go after these data, pull them together and make them available to public health students for their thesis, for their dissertations, make them available to Congress. I think we need that. I don't see a solution out of this, any other solution out of this. For us to rely on individual investigators from big-time universities to do this, I don't think so.   DR. MAYS: I want to follow up. I don't want to let this question go yet, because I think there is something there.   I know that for example NIA put money into finding and archiving data sets. I know NIMH has done it. They have put them at the Murray Center. Of course, we know that IPCSR does this as part of what they do.    Let me come at this question a different way, which is, with the help of people like you and others, would someone be able to find the PIs that have collected data on ANHOPIs, and then allow whoever, in a contract or whatever, for them to look at the data and assess whether or not it might be feasible and that it might be of a nature that it would be important enough to put resources in it and to put it into some archival place where it would be accessible to a larger group of people.   I'm saying this because it is not just some of the data that we are thinking about, but if we broaden this, there may be data over in some of the islands, some of the other places. We might say the CIA needs to -- they have got some data, maybe we need to go to the CIA and find what they have.   But I think I want to push this. I do think that there are short term and long term strategies. I think this is a short term strategy that I have seen, places like the Murray Center in Cambridge, and they have tons of students who go in and use a lot of that data. They have contacted lots of us. They are asking for data sets of mine that are really old. At first I thought it was crazy, and I started looking at the extent to which that has facilitated work, and probably made the careers of some people, and made them believe -- the very things that you are asking for made them believe that they could do this and have an academic job.    So I'm going to do it differently. Could we find those investigators? Would there be a body of people, either at the forum or other places, who could help us find these individuals and then let there be an assessment about the feasibility of taking that data?   DR. YU: Let me answer that question. Definitely, yes, we can find those individuals who have been funded to collect data. I have approached them with this idea.   Let me give you the answer, and then we can jointly think about how we should solve this problem. The answer that they gave me, I approached one investigator about this. It was a data set that he hadn't analyzed for about five years, by the time I talked to him. His answer was, yes, I'll give you the data, I'll let you analyze it, but I must be the first author. I said, then fine. I was never even thinking of excluding you as an author, but first author, I don't know about that. Where would I be in this lineup if there are already two investigators? That means I would be the third author, for going after the data and analyzing it.   If you are a faculty member trying to get tenure, if you don't have first co-authorship paper, you know you are not going to go far with it. So if you have two projects, one in which you could be a first author of a paper and one in which you could be a third author of a paper, where would I put my effort in as a faculty member who wanted to move up in the academic career? I went after the paper where I would be first author. I put low priority on a paper where I would be third author. So I ended up never analyzing that data set.    I think my situation is very typical of what most authors go through. Most investigators wouldn't mind sharing the data, but when it comes to writeup, they would prefer that somehow they have a role in the writeup, or that somehow you give them a copy of what you are writing up, because yu could possibly misinterpret and contradict what they have already published, and they have no chance to respond.    If you could solve that problem, one of authorship, two of how they could give feedback to that answer, I think that we could solve the problem of lack of data in the short term. The question is, I never knew how ICPSR worked that out. I think my understanding of the way ICPSR worked out those data sets is that once you give those up, you give them up forever. You give up your right to authorship, you give up the right to mentor the people who are analyzing that data completely. I don't know Asians who would be willing to do that, the ones that I know who has the data.   MR. HITCHCOCK: Elena, these are publicly funded data sets that you can't get access to?   DR. YU: They were funded, yes. They were publicly funded now, but this was before.   DR. MAYS: I was going to say, anything that is an R0-1, if it is investigator initiated, you maintain control. But now there are some data sharing policies.   I think it is worth the committee thinking about this to some extent.   DR. YU: Yes, definitely.   DR. MAYS: I do think some -- I understand exactly what you are saying, having had people approach me quite often, I understand. Also from having been at Michigan, I know a little bit about the ICPSR setup.    One of the things that I was taught is, before our data sets are finished, we have what is known as a data use policy, because we know people will want to use it. So we actually have those things. So I think it is something.   Did you have another question? Let's move on. Don.   DR. STEINWACHS: Just a quick one. You said something, and I just wanted to make sure I understood it correctly. It was enticing to me. I think it was something in reference to individuals who have multiple racial and ethnic identities being at increased risk for adverse health.   It seems to me that is something that hasn't gotten a lot of focus. It does talk to what I think is a social and behavioral -- it has rubbed off from Virginia -- issue. You don't fit into society quite the same way once you see yourself or others see you as having multiple identities, and that culture and so on.   It seems to me it might be worth also in some ways to talk about what our priorities are in public health, trying to address that group, as different from what we do now, which is to try and label you generally into a specific category. You talked about the different definitions and others have, but it might be some value in a focus for research and public health investigation on that group.   DR. YU: Definitely. In fact, I was quite shocked when I started reviewing the data for CMS, to look at multiracial adolescents, because that is really the group where -- if you are going to have life problems, that is when it emerges. If you don't resolve those identity crises at adolescence, they carry on through life, and one thing leads to another. Smoking leads to drugs leads to sexual experimentation, leads to others. The association is there epidemiologically. If you want to target prevention efforts, this is the group worth spending resources on, definitely.   DR. MAYS: Are there any questions or comments from individuals in the audience?    MR. HITCHCOCK: I'm not in the audience. When you were talking about your family, and you were saying that there are some people who are Portuguese, black, whatever, you mentioned Jewish in there as well. I guess we still have trouble collecting data on religion, but I would think it would be an important variable, given that we could collect it. Maybe some investigators can if they are grantees. The federal government has a hard time doing it. We could ask about religiosity, but we can't ask about specific religious beliefs or practices, which could be very important, I would think.   DR. YU: Yes. I think that religion is a very important variable for certain AAPI groups. It is not as critical for Chinese Americans, for example, even though there are many who are Catholics, there are many who are Protestants, and there are many who are Buddhist. But for other groups, like for Koreans, for example, religion is an important factor, and for some other groups it is.     It definitely is a variable we should collect. Its importance within the ANHOPI groups vary by subgroups.   DR. MAYS: I want to thank you, both for your presentation and also for coming back and answering questions. As you can tell, your presentation sparked a lot of thought in us, so I appreciate again your time in pulling it together. Thank you very much.   DR. YU: Thank you.   DR. MAYS: We are going to take a five-minute break, and then we are going to reconvene. This is a time for the committee to deliberate. Part of what I would like to do is review what is going on in the hearing today. I'm trying to make our report writing a little bit easier.   I want to review what we think some of the recommendations are that have come up, and have some sense -- before we lose that, have some sense of where we want to go with recommendations. I have been trying to keep a list of some things, and I'm sure other people have other things. And of course this is open, it is not a closed session, so other people can also comment on that. Then we will turn our attention to a couple of other pieces of subcommittee business, and then we will adjourn.   So let's take a break.   (Brief recess.)   Agenda Item: Subcommittee Deliberation of Issues   DR. MAYS: What I would like to do is take some time to talk about and discuss as a committee what we heard, what the recommendations as you have heard them that you think this committee should seriously focus on.    I guess if you can discuss those things that seem to be particularly compelling to you, let's make sure we give them some priority, things that may have been -- I don't want to say shocking, but things that you just didn't realize, and that it may be very important for us to highlight those.   Who wants to start?   DR. CAIN: I'll go. One of the things that I heard from all speakers, maybe I am reading into the subtext, was that --   DR. MAYS: I'm just going to make sure that either Dale or Audrey are taking notes on this.   DR. CAIN: -- was a willingness, the need for a willingness to tackle and address and deal with the incredible diversity we have, rather than glossing it over. We do have the ability to do things scientifically, we have the research tools, and I think it might be a matter of just public will to address this.     So I think that everyone in different ways gave that message, that there really needs to be a willingness to really work with the diversity and not try to keep categorizing things and lumping. It is okay to split.   DR. STEINWACHS: Just to add a piece of that, it struck me that some of the conversation, why there might be biases, why we don't invest as much money in looking at Asian populations, invest more in African American. I think part of that message may be perceptions, it was argued, misperceptions, about who is healthy and who is worse off.   There is a tendency I think in society to say, those that are worse off are the ones who may merit more of that investment, but you wouldn't do the same thing if you were better off. One of the arguments Dr. Yu was making, which I thought resonated, was that we need to lay out an agenda that recognizes that we can learn something for the rest of us, possibly from those who are actually doing better in some circumstances, and vice versa, so a balanced agenda.    It does raise what is a gut-level assessment, and maybe this is the scientific way of doing it, saying what is a big enough group for which one would view that there is public health significance. So if you are down to five people, is that a public health problem or just a medical care problem? If you are at 25 people -- so I think there has to be some way for us to talk to that. You can be a small population, but how small? I think the danger currently is that you have to be pretty big in order to have a sense of public health significance. So maybe we need to think about some ways to talk about what that size issue is, even though there is not a precision in doing that.   MR. HITCHCOCK: I think you are right on that. It needs to be a big group, but it helps to be a noisy group. Elena mentioned needs for funding and maybe even legislative language requiring some improvements to be made in these data. That is something that I heard. We really haven't discussed it, having advocates that could somehow get something like this written into law. It doesn't always take all that much to get an amendment onto something. That would be very helpful.   MS. BURWELL: I'd like to follow up on Dale. It is one thing to get something authorized, but to actually say appropriated, where you said many times it translates perhaps into some action.   DR. STEINWACHS: There is a lot of latitude if there is the will, so certainly within NIH as within other parts of HHS, there are offices of minority health, and minority has a political definition of who those minorities are. But that is what we are talking about here, so it is a question of to what extent do you prevail upon and encourage.   Certainly NIH has done some things to encourage R0-1 investigators to pay attention to the composition and not exclude. That doesn't mean they have a sense of why they ought to over sample.   The other is again the kind of flexibility that you have of putting out RFAs, putting out initiatives to try and build more information. So there are some things that if you can do it through Congress, it may be better, because you get more money, more recognition.   The other is, there are ways that both this committee as well as people who sit on this committee are in positions to help discuss what needs to be done when you think about future priorities for investing and developing information, either at the research level or in public health statistics.   MR. LOCALIO: I had a thought. I'm not sure it is the right kind of thought, but it seems like --    DR. STEINWACHS: Do you want us to vote on it?   MR. LOCALIO: No. The existing paradigm has been to design and conduct a survey that focuses on obtaining information about the health of the country. In the process, it hopes that there are subgroups, however defined, that are sufficiently numerous that as a byproduct, one might be able to obtain information about various subgroups.   An analog in a clinical trial is, you have a clinical trial that is large enough so that you expect to obtain information about the differences between the people on drug and the people on placebo, but you hope to be able to obtain information on the effect of drug versus placebo among women, among children, et cetera.   The other way one could approach it would be to say, maybe the paradigm should be that there are surveys that are very focused and targeted on well defined subgroups, and then as a byproduct of that, you are able to combine the results of those surveys and then get results on the population as a whole. The analog in clinical trials would be, you do a lot of clinical trials on various different subgroups, and then you do a meta analysis to try to combine those results into some overall estimate.   Now, this is being very simplistic, because there are a lot of cost issues involved and efficiencies in designing surveys one way or the other. I am sure that the powers that be are never going to drop the idea of having the large heavily stratified and clustered surveys that get at the health or various status of the entire population.    But one way to improve the acceptability of the targeted surveys would be to make sure that all the targeted surveys are not simply targeted surveys that generate data only on the targeted populations, but their results can be combined and then used to create information about larger groups.    I suppose it is possible to take every ethnic, racial and religious group if you wanted to in this country, and divide them into a lot of little cells, and do separate targeted surveys on each one of these cells, and then combine them, and you could reconstitute the entire country.   That is my paradigm. However, I have to say there are a lot of problems there.   DR. STEINWACHS: That is the medical disease paradigm, right?   MR. LOCALIO: Sure. It is also the NIH paradigm. That wasn't for the record.     DR. STEINWACHS: I wouldn't say that for the record.   MR. LOCALIO: I just wanted to throw that out, because one of the things I see is that it is very much easier to convince people of the need and the benefit or the favorable benefit-cost ratio of a particular endeavor if you can say that there is one cost and more than one benefit. It is as simple as that.     DR. MAYS: I do think that kind of paradigm shift that you raised -- I was wondering whether or not that can be discussed with -- who is the report that Diane -- Health U.S., to see if there is any way that in Health U.S., in terms of enhancing it, the idea of offering data in that way might actually be not only instructive, but useful to people, to pull it out.   It is interesting, because the lesson you would learn with the ANHOPI population is that when I did this separately, this is what I have, but then when I put them all together, I lost a lot of this. So that is a very subtle lesson, but it might be useful.    I think the bigger problem may be, depending upon what they use -- no, it is internal. NCHS has the ability to sit in the little Maryland suite and analyze the data.    DR. STEINWACHS: Let me build in one way on Russell's point, which I think is excellent. Health U.S. has as I understand it more of a monitoring perspective, and monitoring doesn't necessarily help lead you to intervention. Certainly monitoring raises issues and say things are looking better or things are looking worse, but it doesn't necessarily help you define what the action is.     I should have read the statistics thing that this committee has done on statistics for the 21st century, then I would have the answer to this, so I may be saying something you have already said. But if you were to transform this to say, what is the information we need to help define an intervention and action agenda, then it seems to me this idea of identifying clusters around which you need information, and those clusters can deal both with what we are talking about here, race and ethnicity, and they may deal with geography, they could deal with groups defined because of higher risk of certain kinds of health disorders that are part of the agenda for objectives for 2010.    I think it would be a different way of thinking about it, and it would reduce maybe some utility in monitoring in some ways, possibly, but you would be beefing up your capacity say, where do we need to intervene, and how do we intervene, I guess, let me put it that way, how do we intervene.   DR. MAYS: Anyone else?   MS. BURWELL: I just wanted to follow Don. Health U.S. is the annual report that NCHS has to submit to Congress, and it is focused heavily on monitoring. A lot of people at NCHS have talked about trying to quote-unquote jazz it up to reflect the flavor of what is going on with racial and ethnic populations. At best, you get maybe a limited chart book, because of that particular report's mission.   It goes back to the fundamental question where we are talking about, what the missions are, and what they are mandated to do. I think the 21st century report was one attempt to try to think beyond what they -- they being NCHS -- ordinarily does.   Since 1990, and before that, but it was really documented in 1990 with the disadvantaged minority health improvement act, that there is substantial need to have special studies for racial and ethnic populations, new methodological approaches, mentoring, training, making sure that people of the populations could do the research. But there again, resources got in the way.   So I'm thinking that the 21st century report is one way that NCHS and others are hoping to build some momentum to be able to address some of the paradigm shifts that we have heard from our speakers, and also what the committee has heard previously.   DR. STEINWACHS: I would think it would be fun to explore, if you did a fundamental redesign from a nationally representative cluster sampling approach, which we do now, to a sampling approach built around some key strata, and then the idea that you could still come up with national estimates, but you would be targeting in a way that we have not been targeting around what you saw as the issues for this decade or this five years or whatever.   MR. LOCALIO: Let me just clarify that. I've got to go back and review the current sampling designs, but it seems to me the stratification is done by geography these days.    I think what you are saying is, you would change that, and have the stratification done by some population group. Then within that, you would do the sampling. Then you would combine the strata and get the whole, and you would then be certain that each of those strata would contain a population subgroup of interest that would be adequate. I think that is what you're saying. I'm trying to translate that into sampling-ese.   DR. STEINWACHS: Well, you're good. They didn't teach me enough sampling-ese, so I like that.   The other, which is not very radical either, is you could be asking a different set of questions to people in different strata. So you could have the common core, but when you got to the ANHOPI, you might have a set of questions that were different than when you got to another stratum. So this idea that all strata have all questions wouldn't have to be there.   So a different way to think about supplements to the surveys, they would be stratum specific possibly, as you thought about those things that were key factors in understanding health and health behaviors.   DR. MAYS: It is a little bit in terms of what happens now in terms of NHANES. NHANES has a core set of questions that NCHS pays for, no matter what. If nobody is ever interested in them, that is still their core set of questions.    Then beyond that, they have interested parties within NIH that then add on questions. Part of what we need to think about is that there is now another center, the National Center for Minority Health and Health Disparities. Probably it might be useful to think about that particular center also rising to the occasion of the consideration for these population-specific groups, that there is funding to answer some of these questions.   The route of just the R0-1s or even the route of the centers, which is what I think they are funding these days, will not get what could happen in terms of that additional funding to be given to NCHS or whoever is conducting some of these large surveys. So we probably shouldn't let it slip from our radar, that that might be a useful request for the Secretary to consider in that office, since part of that office's mandate is to actually be responsible to all these populations.   DR. BREEN: Another thing came out of my personal experience. NCI funds a cancer control module as I said before for NHIS. In 2001, we also funded a cancer control module on the California health interview survey. I had thought maybe we could somehow pool those data.   In fact, as we have learned today, Asians -- or have been learning over the course of our hearings -- Asians are concentrated on the West Coast, and a very large proportion live in California. So why not?    Well, the why-not is because when you have a sample size of 55,000 in California but you have a national health interview survey with a sample size of 40,000, then the effective sample size of your California population becomes dinky. So all of these Asians are not counting for much when you try to incorporate them back into the national data set.   It strikes me that it might be useful for us to have some methodological -- or recommend some methodological work be done in order to be able to incorporate small populations that are concentrated in small portions of the United States to be able to be better represented in some way, rather than just folded into the national data set, which is pretty small, and therefore is not going to give them much more power than they had to start with in that national data set.   I don't have a solution to that problem. I don't know if this is -- you said you are not a survey statistician, so I will presume this is not your area of expertise, either. It is not mine. But it seems like an area that might be worth pursuing, because it would -- it seems like a terrible waste of data.     DR. MAYS: Let me just follow up, and then Eugene has his hand up. One of the issues might be that if we continue to focus on trying to get the national estimates -- I think we should fund some methodological work to do this, but it may be that if we continue to try and do national estimates, that it is kind of like chasing your tail to some extent, as opposed to even taking CHIS and something else in Illinois and something else somewhere else and actually doing a meta analysis.   A meta analysis takes a lot of time and energy, and you can debate it. Some people swear by it, other people swear at it.   DR. BREEN: We do have those techniques, and it would be a way to not waste the data, which really is the issue.   DR. MAYS: That may be something to think about relative to what are some of the kinds of RFAs, RFPs, PAs or whatever you want to think about, that would actually lead both to the development of some methodological papers, but also to somebody analyzing data in ways in which it then gives us some useful information.    So it isn't just the California study, but somebody can then do California, New York and Illinois.   Eugene and then Don.   DR. LENGERICH: I raised my hand a couple of comments ago, so it will be interesting to see how this comment actually plays out. I think Nancy and Vickie, your comments --   DR. STEINWACHS: Don't you want to modify your comment and bring it up to date?   DR. LENGERICH: This may be a summary, how's that? I'll do a meta analysis here. But I like the way the last couple of comments are going, steering towards methodologic issues or studies. What I had raised my hand earlier about was reflecting upon the sampling. I guess I was just going to point out that I think when we talk about sampling frames, we need to be very specific about the particular surveys and particularly those coming out of NCHS.   There is NHANES, which truly is meant to represent the country, I believe, and it makes no attempt to present regional geographic estimates, to my knowledge. It is very broad. Then there is HIS, which does take into geographical consideration and attempts to make regional estimates, and that is clearly part of what it is intended to do. Then there are things like SLATES, which is a state and local survey, which has that as its primary target.   So I get a little concerned -- and this is back a couple of comments ago, when we think about the sampling frame, we need to be very specific about which of those national surveys we are referring to. That leads me to be a lot more in favor of the final, where Vickie and Nancy were going with the methodologic targeted surveys, with our existing surveys, and support that kind of recommendation.   DR. MAYS: It was up to date.   DR. LENGERICH: Thank you. You just filled it in before I knew it needed to be filled in. You did a great job.   DR. MAYS: Russell, you're on.   MR. LOCALIO: Two followup comments on methodology. One we touched on, and that is how might one combine various surveys into something that is larger, and what would be the methodology around that.   Now, I know there is some ongoing work on the question of how do you take a survey that may be too small and come up with somewhat better estimates by using outside data, whether it is additional surveys or national surveys.   I have to say that what I hear from the street is that one of the difficulties in some of this methodological work is one of the issues that I have brought up repeatedly, and that is the restrictions on access to the data whereby you could do this research. In other words, if you have to go to Hyattsville to do this research, it is very hard to do it.   So I think one of the things that we have to always come up with, and this came up again this morning, are there restrictions that are currently placed on access to the data worth the cost, whether it is methodology, or in terms of individual subpopulations getting access to the resulting data? So I think a lot of this is tied in.   DR. STEINWACHS: I reflect on the fact, every time I think of the academic institutions as archaic, that the universities are about a thousand years old now, and we still wear those black robes, which I think we can thank the monks for, who were the keepers of the knowledge for a thousand years before that or so. So we have survived, and a lot of things have disappeared over that period of time, so maybe we shouldn't become too modern. Maybe being archaic has something to do with survival, even though it has nothing to do with immediate relevance.   DR. MAYS: I'm going to follow up on Russell's comment. I'm going to leave the black robes along, because I have to wear those every year. I have to do graduations, so I'll leave that one alone.   But anyway, when we met with -- when Sondig met with the committee at the full committee meeting, this issue was raised with him about sharing with the Census Bureau as a possibility of increasing. You can see the value of what the Census Bureau has done.    Maybe it would be worthwhile for us to actually put that in writing, to make that a specific request. The subcommittee has translated that request to Jennifer, and now we translated it at the full committee meeting to Sondig. But it might be useful to us. We keep coming back to it, we just keep coming back to it.   So I think it would be useful, rather than looking like, when you get a chance could you let us know, to, this is critical as we are moving along, trying to make recommendations to have a sense of whether this is doable or not doable.    So I guess I am going to suggest that that is something we may do, is just draft a letter to Sondig, following up on having raised this, and ask for a response in a specific amount of time.   MR. LOCALIO: Just to follow up on that, I did speak to him very briefly after his presentation. I said I thought this was an issue that needed clarification. If as I anticipated a problem came up, in having subpopulations getting access to subpopulation data, it would be a problem if they had to go to Hyattsville,   He was very open to it. He said, maybe we should have a meeting devoted to that only issue. We talked about the beginning of the year. I said yes, I would hope so. So maybe -- I'm not talking about a big meeting, I'm just talking about a meeting devoted solely to that issue and to what the options are.    Maybe what we ought to think about in preparation for that is, what have we heard today and on other days as to the needs that various people have that would have to be addressed in whatever an NCHS policy might be.    I don't think we can do much about Census. I think Census probably has a longer history and I think it has a more restrictive statute. But I do have to say that the e-gov statute, Dale, that you gave me has a very different outlook, in terms of sharing and especially sharing for what is called statistical purposes.   Almost everything that we have heard today in terms of peoples' needs fall within the ambit of statistical purposes as it is defined in that very recent legislation. It talks about analysis and complex analysis. So given that we have that new piece of legislation that says share, and given that we have expressed today a series of desires that people would like, for example, more of these data centers or something like that, given that we talked about the difficulty in getting access to data sets that have already been collected and are in file drawers, boxes --   by the way, I do know what Wordstar is, having used it -- in various forms that make access difficult, we ought to say, if we revisit this problem, what are all of the needs and then what are the possible solutions.   It should be very global. It should be not just one need and one solution, but all the needs and a variety of solutions.   DR. MAYS: I'm going to suggest then that the Subcommittee on Populations try and pull such a meeting together, and that we also ask for representatives to be from NHII in the privacy and confidentiality group, to join us for that. This really does overlap into some of their issues as well as ours.   MR. LOCALIO: What about having somebody from OMB as well, given that OMB -- Dale, correct me, is OMB e-gov? I think that was entirely an OMB initiative, and I believe OMB drafted it. So if possible, have somebody in from OMB and say what are the implications if the e-gov legislation -- how are they thinking about it, and should other agencies conform to that, even if the statute does not mandate that.   I don't know about Census, because as I said, Census is a much older and more difficult problem.   DR. MAYS: I think we should invite them.   MR. LOCALIO: Although if Census goes to the American Community Survey, that becomes less like -- an American Community Survey is not a census.   DR. STEINWACHS: It is like an NHIS.   MR. LOCALIO: Census is, you count every body. An American Community Survey is a sample.   DR. BREEN: The long form of the Census was a sample, too.   MR. LOCALIO: I know.   DR. MAYS: We are going to put that as one of our action items.   DR. BREEN: What is the e-gov legislation?   MR. HITCHCOCK: There are about 24 e-government initiatives. One of them is statistical sharing data for statistical purposes. Another one is doing a one-stop for access to government geospatial data.   DR. BREEN: Maybe we should distribute the e-mail or the website or whatever?    MR. HITCHCOCK: Yes, we can do that.   MR. LOCALIO: The thing you sent me was about 60 pages long. There are only three pages in that that are relevant.   DR. MAYS: We can ask you if you will send it, and then we will send that around to the committee.   MR. LOCALIO: Let me see if I can send that back to you, the three pages that I think are relevant, and if you could then take a look at that, verify that that is what you mean, or that it covers everything, and then you can send it around.   MR. HITCHCOCK: I can do that, and I can also send around just a page that lists all 24 of them, and links to each individual topic.   DR. BREEN: I think we should also have Census. The other problem besides the access to data that is confidential, not personal identifiers, but things that might reveal individual identities, is this commingling business, where you can't have the Census and any other data set that the government collects on the same computer. That is a giant barrier, too, which I think we need to try to think of some solutions to address. So I would encourage Census coming to this meeting.   DR. HUNGATE: I'm going to move a little bit from where we are, but I think it is building on the same base. I was impressed by the national children's study and its length of plan. I was saying to myself, that is going to yield a lot of data. Is it going to be responsive to the kinds of inputs that we heard here today?    So I've asked myself, what have I got to do now to try to get that to do that, to be sure that that happens? I ended up on this kind of an approach, and I'd appreciate feedback as to whether I'm crazy or not.    The lineup the national children's study has is 100,000 surveys, 100,000 participants. I know going in that is going to be inadequate for populations at some size, because it is not going to sample enough people to have anything representative at some size of the population.   Now, that is a mathematically determinate number, I think. It is going to have to be an awful lot bigger to get to some of the small populations that you really want to look at. So you have to accept that if you are going to do a good job, you are going to have to argument what you are doing. You ought to do it in a rational way.    So I say, I want to go look at the Census data and see what the population sizes are for the populations of interest. If those are the population sizes, and they are not going to be all the same size, they are going to be variable, there are probably groups that are very small, some that are bigger. So there is going to have to be a stratification decision of those group sizes, based on group size, for what you have to do to get at it.   I think that it is going to be that you also think about not only what is going to be the outcome of the survey, but who is going to use it when we are done with it. I think if I were doing it, the smaller the population is, the more I want to have a partnership within the population that does the work, so that I can specify within the national study what the study is.   DR. MAYS: That is an excellent idea. Actually we are going to put this on the agenda for tomorrow. I'm very glad you brought tit up now because I don't want to lose this.   One of the things that they talked about is that they are planning to do a similar -- they are in love with the women's health initiative, and they were talking about doing this similar to the women's health initiative, where what you would have would be different groups, academic institutions or someone out there who would actually then be the people helping to collect this data.   If that is the case, then if we work with them earlier on to specify this, then you would have to meet this requirement. You are responding because you can get certain groups. In SWAN, for example, part of why UCLA did that is because we are in a site where we can bring in the Asian population.   DR. HUNGATE: This makes sense.   DR. MAYS: So then what you have is, in the RFP, it clearly says what they are looking for in terms of expertise. That would help enormously, because at least you would be putting it with investigators who have to reach some of those populations. That is a requirement.   DR. HUNGATE: I guess what I am thinking is that our recommendation along this line would be broadly speaking to make this survey do that, the stratification. But it seems to me that we ought to also think about how do you define the population sizes and maybe put some recommendations in differences of approach that relate to the population size. I think it is not a one size fits all.   MR. HITCHCOCK: I think that is an excellent idea. One of the things that we have been hearing all along is how difficult it is sometimes for smaller community surveys to go in through the back door, something like NHANES or NHIS. If we are planning a new survey, why don't we plan it in such a way that there is a front door that groups can use to get into the survey, link up with the survey and possibly run smaller parallel studies that may be smaller or not so comprehensive in scale, but yet comparable on some items, at least.   Why not plan it with something in the design that would allow for outside groups to build onto the survey, participate in it?   DR. HUNGATE: I got a chance to speak with our presenter on the subject. We ended up on the Metro together, so we had five stops in which to talk about it.    DR. MAYS: You did good in those five stops.   DR. HUNGATE: I did all right. I asked what is their plan for argumentation, and he said, we have one, and they are actively going on direction.    So I think that this is not at all inconsistent with what they are doing, and that it just might be a way to tie in what we are doing in that augmented way.   DR. MAYS: I think it was good that we were able to get him at this meeting. I think to some it looks like there is not a lot going on, but in the background as I understand it, there is a lot going on, and that once it all gets pulled together, it will look like all of a sudden everything came together, when there has actually been work going on to help justify the direction that the study is going to go in.   So when I asked about sending in a letter, whether or not March would be a good time, he was like, no, sooner rather than later. So what we are going to try and do, which is why I asked Leslie to be on the phone with us tomorrow when we have some deliberation time, is that given that we may have a full committee meeting in January, the end of January, we should try and have a letter ready to go for that meeting.    Again, we don't want to have to, after the study is out, to then chase after it and say, can you do this, can you do that. I think now is really the time to try and move ahead.   DR. HUNGATE: I think there is a chance to get it right here, that there really is the leverage of doing one of them in a way that is truly responsive to the need. I think it would be huge in terms of other kinds of impacts. The pilot that works people understand after that.   DR. MAYS: Definitely, that is after lunch on our agenda, so let's revisit it, because I want to do some planning about getting a letter written about what we want to say.    As I pointed out to him, I said we might be recommending some additional workshops that you need to do. It might be we are recommending some different conceptualizations. So he really did say we should do it sooner rather than later, so let's discuss this some more. But I think that is an excellent suggestion. It clearly builds upon what we have heard in the hearings, so I think that will be very helpful.   I'm just going to go down some of the recommendations that I have heard, because I don't want to lose these recommendations, and see where we can go with them. Some of our presenters have given us recommendations, like the one from Ho Tran actually has specific recommendations. Now we have also heard those. So these are some of the things that I have jotted down, and maybe my interpretation, and then I'd like to get other things out and say let's get rid of that or keep that or something like that.   First of all, there is one about translation in terms of the language, in terms of the survey questions. I'm not going to flesh all this out, but definitely this issue about translating the surveys, particularly if we can translate the NCHS surveys, whether NCHS is collecting the data or not, the question of, can some of the NCHS surveys be translated up and available, so that if other people wanted to repeat that, they would be able to repeat that.     I think I have heard a lot of stuff about language. I think we were asking questions about language. Suzanne?   DR. HEURTIN-ROBERTS: In terms of language and actual cultural equivalency, I think there is a tension that we have to acknowledge. On one side we are calling for cultural appropriateness specific to a group of a survey instrument. On the other hand, we have Don with his population quilt of the U.S., and talking about meta analyses. There is a tension between comparability across surveys, and the idea of making something truly appropriate and useful for a culture, a specific population, let's say.   Now, I think you can't get around having something appropriate for a specific population, because otherwise you end up with data that is not very meaningful. On the other hand, if you want to compare, we have to devise some method to get around that, especially if we are talking about doing something on a national scale.   DR. MAYS: What would be really great if is in some way, either NCHS or NIH had this website, that the questionnaires are up there, and if I in California translated something and then had a equivalency, then I just put it up, and then it is there for other researchers to use it. If anything, then you end up with your variables in a whole lot of other data sets, which most of us are fine with that, even if we don't get access to it. But to have the questions up and available to some extent would -- if there was some way to be able to do that in terms of the use of technology, it would make all the difference in the world.   It costs quite a bit to translate an instrument. If it is done and you are very specific about how you did it so that you know which subgroup, and then it was up and available, it would really make a difference, I think.   DR. BREEN: There is a precedent for that. One of my colleagues at NCI is putting together a similar kind of thing for smoking questions. She is developing the tobacco control supplement to the CPS. So it is translated into Spanish routinely. She is translating it routinely or having it translated into some Asian languages.   The whole idea is to get it up on the web so that researchers who want to use questions or that whole instrument could do so. So it sounds to me that this is on a very small scale, and it is not informal, but I don't know that she is going to be developing the technology that would be needed to have an accessible data set with a large number of questions, which I think is kind of what we are thinking of. But this is a beginning, anyway.    So it is not unprecedented, what you are suggesting. I think it is very doable.   DR. CAIN: I think that the National Library of Medicine is doing this on a larger scale as well, not necessarily translated questionnaires, I don't know if they have branched out into that, but we could get some more information about what NLM is doing.   DR. MAYS: Can we ask NLM to maybe come to even the next subcommittee and find out if it is just a matter of, we need to ask and it happens? It doesn't sound like we need to write the Secretary over this unless it is a money thing, but I think that they may have resources actually to do that. So I think I would like to follow up on that.   Eugene?   DR. LENGERICH: This is a question that is mostly out of ignorance, but is there some sort of quality or a process that these translations should have processed through before they get put on that accessible website? So should that be part of the recommendation as well, that they meet a certain standard or process before they are available?   DR. BREEN: Definitely, yes. Just to say what translation method you used, and to provide full information would be better than having standards that somebody set.   DR. YU: I'd like to make two comments. One is that we should definitely encourage those investigators who have already translated certain instruments and who have already published papers from the studies to share those instruments at a website that is accessible to everybody.   For example, we had the Asian American cancer control questionnaires in Mandarin, Cantonese and Korean. I wanted to share them with a lot of people. I don't have the resources to put them up on the website. I tried spending $3,000 to put my niece into learning how to write websites. Unfortunately, she got stuck on graphics. She doesn't know how to put up the graphics. She knows how to write a program to put it up, but then the question is, how do I maintain it. I don't have the personal resources to do that.   There are already Asian investigators with data sets, with translated versions of instruments, especially on cancer screening tests and use of cancer screening tests. There must be at least about 20 studies already in 20 AAPI languages. We should somehow go to those investigators and ask them to put it up on the website, so people who are going to do research will hire native speakers who can read those languages, and make a judgment as to how two or three different versions differ and what is applicable to their situation.   The second comment I have concerning a question raised by somebody earlier about the issue of equivalence versus the standardized translations. I think that can be resolved by having core versus supplement questions.   Let me give you as an example the smoking questions that we added to our cancer control studies. When we did the interviews in Chinese, we added a question that I know as a member of that ethnic group that the Koreans do not have. Among Chinese from Taiwan, a very common addictive substance used is betelnut, chewing betelnut. That is associated with lesions in your mouth. That is also highly suspected to be a carcinogenic agent for oral cancer.   In the Chinese questionnaire, we copied and translated and tested the equivalency between the cancer control questions, smoking questions that NHIS used with our Chinese version, but in the Chines version we added a question, have you used betelnut. Then we asked how often did you use it.   In the Korean version that question is missing, because Koreans don't use that. So this would be how you would address the equivalency versus translation question. It is one approach. Just like the NHIS, they have a core question and then they have supplement questions. We should think that way in terms of studying the different ethnic groups. Then we would be able to capture something that is culture specific and yet be able to come up with estimates that are comparable at a population level across different populations.    So those would be my two comments.   DR. MAYS: I think that fits into what Don was recommending in terms of when you think about how you set it up. Once you knew the person's race and ethnicity, there are certain skip patterns that are engaged for those people. So it could be that it is still core, but it is core for a particular group. Again, I think that is something to think about.   So we are getting all these recommendations down, and I think what we should do -- I'll actually ask the staff to do it because I'm not as good at it -- is the distinction between what has to go up at the level of Thompson. Some of these can go directly to NLM, some can go to NCHS. NCHS now has a Board of Scientific Counselors, and it might be very useful in the January meeting for them to receive this as a set of issues that have evolved, because they give us some insight into possible ways that they think NCHS might be able to do this. So that may be part of the liaison role.   I think as we come up with these recommendations, you ought to be thinking about where they need to go. That would probably help us.   Training. There was a lot of discussion about training at all these different levels that I think we should think about. There is training of how to use the Census data, in terms of specifically at the community level. There was NIH training fellowships for data analysis, for example, in ANHOPI populations. There was training to insure that there is technical assistance. There was training in terms of the development of investigators from these populations.    We often don't talk about that as much, but that seems to me today has really emerged as the necessity for either technical assistance or going back to -- I know at some point i time when there were the training grants, some of the training grants that come from NIH, certain categories of people qualify and others don't, so it may be the time to examine that.   I think that -- Audrey, what was the program called that you ran at NCHS?     MS. BURWELL: Minority health statistics grants program.   DR. MAYS: Minority health statistics grants program has disappeared. That was another source of nurturing and developing individuals. I think that Dr. Sondig did raise that it would be nice if such programs could come back, but that may be a resource issue. But it may be important for us to identify these things. This does sound like this is probably at the level of Secretary in terms of commenting about the need for training.   DR. BREEN: Maybe, but the National Center for Minority Health and Health Disparities does an enormous amount of training.   DR. MAYS: You're right.   DR. BREEN: So I would consider them as substitutes. They actually have more money than the program that was --   DR. MAYS: And they can put out very specific programs to do that. There are a variety of ways to do that. In their center grant they require that. So there is a lot of different ways to try to contribute to that. So I think this may be something to bring to their attention in terms of this particular population.     MS. BURWELL: I would only like to caution that even though the National Center for Minority Health and Health Disparities has a larger pot, I think we should encourage development wherever it is appropriate, because you have a much better rate of success if you have more activities going on.   DR. MAYS: Suzanne.   DR. HEURTIN-ROBERTS: One of the things that we can't forget is the Pacific Islanders, the incredible diversity. We need to go beyond just training -- which is not unimportant, training regular scientific investigators, but we also need to train the local populations to be able to use data, access data, ask the questions of the data that they would like answered.   She said the word development; I'm thinking of foreign development that occurs economically and so on. I think there needs to be some sort of development in these areas, in terms of local access and -- what is the word? It is not research literacy, but some equivalent of that.   DR. MAYS: I think it is like a census model, almost as if it could get taken other places. You think about census data, this is incredible, to have the community groups accessing the Census data and having a query system.    It is basically what CHIS does. You take this mass of data and you pull it down to a query system. It is the same thing that we have seen Suzanne Haynes doing with the women's health data. They are able to get this so that you can do all kinds of cross tabs and find out various things. But again, there just hasn't been the focus on Pacific Islanders.   DR. HUNGATE: That is part of what I was thinking about, that group particularly and the approach to the national children's. It seems to me that one of the best ways to develop that strength is to have a contract within the island for the development of the information, and do it on a specific -- not on an abstract. I don't know whether it would work or not, whether anybody would apply for the contract.   DR. HEURTIN-ROBERTS: The issue is who could apply and would they be equipped to even apply. I don't know.   DR. HUNGATE: And I don't know.   DR. MAYS: Something you said reminded me of a suggestion you made. That was about generating a complete list of languages. I think you all over there were talking about that. That may be important. So as you are putting up these questionnaires or whatever, you have a sense of, oops, we don't have these ten, and if nobody is doing it, that is where we need to put some funds to do it. There are no researchers that have those.   So I think being able to -- and I have no idea how to do that. Suzanne, you are an anthropologist, so maybe you can help here. Aren't there languages that aren't recorded languages, that are just oral? So I'm not sure how we would tackle it.   DR. HEURTIN-ROBERTS: We are talking about those languages right now. There are languages like that.   DR. MAYS: Yes, so I think we need as a recommendation to find a way -- again, I don't know whose back yard that falls in, but to generate a complete list of languages. Then your comment was also, pursue a partnership for translation and use. Again, I think if it is available, what you will see is that the agencies, institutes and centers will thi

Morgan Athletics Center   325 Westwood Plaza   Los Angeles, California   Proceedings by:   CASET Associates, Ltd.   10201 Lee Highway, Suite 160   Fairfax, Virginia 22030   (703)352-0091     TABLE OF CONTENTS     Welcome and Introductions - Dr. Vickie Mays    Status Report on the Brown Paper by the South Asian       Public Health Association   Report of South Asian Network - Perdita Upadhyah    Presentation by Dr. Kagawa-Singer   Presentation by Ignatius Bau   Remarks by Mae Cruz Guenther and June Cruz Milligan     Remarks by Salla Mataalii    Remarks by Jane Pang and Vincent Pang        Wrap Up Session        P R O C E E D I N G S (8:55 a.m.)     Agenda Item: Welcome and Introduction.      MS. MAYS: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the second day of our hearings. I think I will do just a quick intro again, in terms of like what our process will be.    On behalf of UCLA, I welcome you here, and on behalf of the Subcommittee on Populations for the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics, it is my honor to welcome you to the meeting and to thank all of you who are here, for being here.    I realize it is a holiday weekend. So, I bet you had some choices. That is what they say on the airlines. We are happy you came to be with us.    Anyway, as all of you know, the hearing today is dedicated to look at issues of the collection of data on race and ethnicity in Asian, Native Hawaiian, and other Pacific Islander populations.    In terms of why we are doing this, the goal has been, as part of the Subcommittee on Populations, the goal has been to really try to determine whether or not we are collecting the data that we need to determine if there are health disparities, to look at some of the methodological issues, to try and understand, for example, issues of misclassification, the role that language plays, geography, particular issues with small populations, to ensure that we have information on health status, health behaviors, and access to care, in order to ensure that the health of this population is the best that it can be, to use some of the government lingo here.    So, we have had a series of hearings. This is one of those, in which what we try and do is be in places where the population that we are interested in talking to is more likely to be able to attend the hearing and talk with us. That is part of the reason we are in Los Angeles.     On Saturday, Dr. Kagawa-Singer, who will be here a bit later, has a conference that she is sponsoring on the health of Asian and Pacific Islanders. Part of what we tried to do was to tag onto that meeting.    The process that we will follow throughout the hearing is that typically we will have advisors and experts who will be talking with us.    The committee will then ask a set of questions and then we open it up to he audience. We welcome participation by everyone. So, please do not hesitate at all to come to the mike if you have a question or comment.    What we also usually do when we start our hearings is, in addition to the committee introducing themselves, we will ask those of you who are here with us also to introduce yourselves. So, I will start.    I am Vickie Mays. I am the chair of the Subcommittee on Populations, and I am also a professor here at UCLA.    MR. HITCHCOCK: Good morning. My name is Dale Hitchcock. I am with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and I am a staff person for the subcommittee.     MR. LENGERICH: Gene Lengerich. I am a member of the subcommittee, and I am from Penn State University.     MS. JACKSON: Debbie Jackson, the National Center on Health Statistics, and staff to the national committee.    MS. BREEN: Good morning. I am Nancy Breen. I am an economist at the National Cancer Institute. I work in the division of cancer control on population science. I have a special interest in cancer screening and healthy populations, and have always been upset that we don't have data on Asians and Pacific Islanders to analyze, outside of that other category, until CHIS.    MS. LI: My name is Susan Li(?). I am a program specialist at the Orange County Asian and Pacific Islander Community Alliance in Garden Grove.    MS. TRAN: Good morning. I am Jacqueline Tran(?). I am a program manager at the Orange County Asian Pacific Islander Community Alliance in Garden Grove.      MR. DO: Good morning, Julian Do, co-director of New California Media in Los Angeles. We actually assisted UCLA with the CHIS survey, a couple of years ago.     MS. TOSTA: Hi, I am Elan Tosta(?). I am with the South Asian Public Health Association.    MS. WHITE: I am Gracie White with NCVHS Subcommittee on Populations.    MR. CHHAY: Chanda Chhay. I am the transcriptionist for this committee.    GREG: My name is Greg, and I work for AVS.    MS. WILHEIT: Cheryl Wilheit(?), Magna Systems, contractor to NCVHS.    MR. CHANOSA: My name is Danny Chanosa(?). I am with the Asian Pacific American Legal Center. I direct our demographic research unit.    MR. MAYS: Good morning, and welcome. We were introducing ourselves. So, you just walked in at a perfect time.    Dr. Kagawa Singer is on her way. She actually has computer problems. So, we are going to actually get started, and then she will join us.    I am very happy to have you here today. One of the things that I had heard quite a bit about was what is being called the brown paper. I think that is a great idea that, instead of all these white papers, that we start talking about brown papers.    I had heard quite a bit about the brown paper. I think part of what we ought to know about this is that it was all done with volunteer labor. So, this is actually a labor of love.    For those of you -- she only had a few. What I told her we would do is, also make sure that, when things go up on the web site, we will put some information on the web site about it, because we can't put the whole report of.     It is called The Health of South Asians in the United States. Again, the theme for today really has been for us to look at those populations where we really do have information.    So, I really do want to say welcome to you and to say thank you to your group for all the efforts that they engaged in, to put the brown paper together. Thank you. Welcome.     Agenda Item: Status report on Brown Paper of the South Asian Public Health Association.    MS. GUPTA: Thank you so much. I want to say, on behalf of the South Asian Public Health Association and all our hard working volunteers, that we really appreciate the opportunity to share the information about this exciting report and our work.    So, just to give you an overview of the presentation, I just want to give you a little bit of background about SAPHA, and overview about the brown paper.     I will then talk a little bit more about the South Asian community, define who South Asians are and also present some of the data that is in this report about South Asians, classification issues, I will talk a little bit about the immigration history, overall numbers -- a lot of the data is from the census -- the geographic distribution and some other key demographic facts.    Then, to close out, I will talk about some of the recommendations that we were able to glean from putting together the brown paper.    SAPHA was actually established in spring of 1999. It began with about 10 committed individuals, actually on the east coast, a combination of students and professionals around the Baltimore area.    Since then, the list serv has really grown. That is what it primarily was. Thanks to e mail communication and this technology, we have been able to, just by word of mouth, at American Public Health Association meetings and other such venues, really spread the word about the existence of this list serv. Today, we have nearly 400 participants on the list serv.    SAPHA is actually in the process of becoming incorporated, as we have taken on this brown paper project, and are really trying to establish where we want to go in the future.    The mission of SAPHA is to promote the health and well being of South Asian communities, and the advancement of public health professionals.     We have a couple of goals, to provide a forum for mentorship, dialogue and resource sharing among public health professionals working with South Asian communities, advance the leadership, networking and professional development of South Asian public health professionals, to raise the awareness of health risks and encourage healthy behaviors among South Asians, increase the awareness of the value of culturally appropriate services for South Asians in the United States, and encourage and support research and academic communities interested in South Asian health issues.    I think one of the reasons that we were able to be so successful with the brown paper is because the list serv has such a variety of people, from researchers and academics to professionals, people who work in government settings, community advocates. So, it is really quite a range of people.    So, this is a little picture of our brown paper report, which we are really proud of and really excited about. It was published in the fall.    The purpose of it was to review the research and literature on South Asian health in the United States. Continually, we are running into the problem that there are no data about our communities.     So, we decided that it would be a useful exercise to try and actually put together a compendium which really summarized the state of South Asian health.      There is some data. There is some literature to be able to summarize that, in order to show where we are doing well, identify gaps in services and health disparities.    The project was initiated in July of 2000 and, as I mentioned, the paper was published in October of last year.    The methodology that we used in putting it together, through the list serv, we asked if people were interested in writing a chapter on a topic in which they had expertise.    As a result, we were able to include 13 different chapters in the paper on various health topics. In addition, as we were compiling all this great information, we also decided to put together a resource directory, so that people could have more information about various organizations that serve the South Asian community throughout the country, and that is the last section here in the brown paper.    We are hoping also to put that on line as a format that would be very easy to update and that would also be easy for people to access.    The methodology that I mentioned was the list serv participants came forward to review the current literature. Also, in addition, sometimes when literature and data wasn't available, key informant interviews were sometimes conducted with community-based organizations and other key leaders.    For example, on topics like substance abuse and mental health, there is a scarcity of data about Asian Americans in general, including South Asians.    So, that is how the information was gathered, and the 13 topics that are included in the brown paper are a sociodemographic profile, just to sort of give a context for the rest of the chapters, youth health, women's health, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender health, elderly health, cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, intimate partner violence, mental health, nutrition and substance abuse.    It doesn't mean that these are the only health issues in our community. There are some other ones that we would have loved to have chapters on but, again, this was a volunteer effort and people sort of came forward to do this. So, it was really exciting to have this all come together.    Just to tell you a little bit about who South Asians are, they are a diverse set of communities and cultures with family origins in seven countries.     The countries of origin include Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Broader definitions of the South Asia region sometimes include Afghanistan, Tibet, as well as Myanmar, which was formerly Burma.    It is also important to note that not everybody who is here in the United States came directly from these countries.    The influences of colonialism, as well as people pursuing economic opportunities meant that the diaspora includes communities that lived in other countries, perhaps, for one or several generations.    There are large South Asian communities in Trinidad and other parts of the Caribbean, as well as in Guyana and other parts of South America, in certain parts of Africa such as Kenya and Uganda.    There are also very large South Asian communities that have lived there for several generations, as well as Fiji and other parts of the Pacific Islands, as well as Canada and the United Kingdom.    To give you a little bit of information about South Asians here in the United States, South Asians actually have a very rich history here in the United States.    People think of this community as an emerging community. Even though the bulk of migration has happened in the last approximately 40 years, South Asians have been in the United States since the 1790s.     The first report of a South Asian man was in the 1790s, an unidentified man from Madras. From that time period to the early 1900s, South Asians came to the United States in small numbers, primarily Punjabis, Sikhs and Muslims. Punjab is a state in the northern part of India.    They primarily came and settled in the western and south western United States and worked in the agriculture and lumber industries.    Then, there was some legislation that took place that prevented Asian Americans from certain countries from coming here to the United States, which closed off further South Asian immigration.    The immigration act of 1917 established a barred zone of countries, including the South Asian region. Then secondly, the immigration law of 1924 prohibited recent immigrants from bringing family members, such as wives and children, over.    Then, it wasn't until 1946 the Loos-Seller(?) bill was enacted, which created citizenship for Indians and Filipinos, that the ban on South Asian immigration was lifted and allowed an annual quote of 100 immigrants.     Really, the second wave of immigration of South Asians was in 1965 through the immigration and naturalization act.    This is really what people think about when they think about South Asian Americans. It enabled large numbers of professionals, such as doctors, engineers and lawyers, to come into the United States, and it is also known as sort of a brain drain on the countries of origin.    Then, things started to shift a little bit in the 1980s to the present. A third wave of immigration started, and there are really two parts to that third wave.    The first is also what has received a lot of publicity. The growth of the high tech sector here in the United States brought in a large number of professionals, primarily on work visas, as contract laborers, engineers who worked in the computer industry in Silicon Valley or in other parts of the country.    Again, that has been seen a lot in the press. What I think is not as well known is the second part. The family reunification provisions of the 1965 immigration and naturalization act allowed people to bring over members of their family that were lower skill level, blue collar workers.    So, you see in certain areas of the country, such as New York, there are large populations of taxi drivers, people who work in convenience stores. So, this was a markedly different population compared to the previous wave, and also the other high tech sector workers.    MS. MAYS: Can I ask a question? Can you go back to this slide? What would be useful also is if you could tell me just a couple of things in terms of these three groups.    In terms of group two and three, where did they settle in the United States? Part of what we are also trying to learn is where clusters might be, and whether that would then facilitate our ability to do geographic kind of sampling.    The other is particularly, I guess, for three, if there are language issues at all, and then maybe you can tell us what those languages are.     MS. GUPTA: I will actually be getting into that information a little bit later, when I get into some of the data. So, if there are specific questions you have then that I don't cover, please feel free and let me know.    MS. BREEN: One more thing before you leave that slide. Were there particular reasons that people left their country of origin to come, that might have an effect on health or welfare that would help us understand this, too?      MS. GUPTA: Sure. In general, people tend to come for sort of the same reasons, for economic prosperity, also there might have been political instability in the countries that they were coming from. So, those would be important considerations as well.    MS. BREEN: But you don't have anything more specific than those general reasons, but those would be the reasons?    MS. GUPTA: Yes. I think especially the second part of the third wave, there were people coming especially related to political instability in their countries of origin.    I will just talk a little bit about identification of South Asians. The classification of South Asians is extremely complicated due to the diversity of this community.    I mean, it is a pretty significant geographic region. This subcontinent of South Asia probably parallels in diversity to that of Europe.    A very large number of languages. The country of India has 26 official languages, but unofficial languages are much higher, you know, in the hundreds.     Here in the United States, the most common languages are Bengali, Hindi, Punjabi, Gujarati and Urdu. Also, these are the languages in which there tends to also be the highest rates of limited English proficiency.    So, the community-based organizations that have been doing health advocacy and health education work have tended to try and translate materials into these languages.    Incredible diversity in terms of religion as well. The major religions are Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Sikhism, Zoroastrian and Jainism.    For example, even though India is a country that is 80 percent Hindu, it has a very significant Muslin population. There are more Muslims in India, actually, than in the country of Pakistan or the country of Bangladesh, because the population is so large in India.    Then, in terms of culture, too, there is incredible variation in culture, depending on the region you are from.    So, people may identify according to the region they are from. They may identify as Punjabi, they may identify according to language or according to religion. So, this makes classification and self identification very complicated.    I think the term South Asian is something that has sort of come out of community activism, and seeing the commonalities of these groups and trying to collect data not only for the individual subgroups, but looking at South Asians as a whole, I don't think all community members would necessarily identify as South Asian.    They may identify more strongly as Muslim rather than Indian. There is a lot of complexity when you ask people to self identify.    I think also people may not be that educated. For example, with Indians, they may interpret if you are Indian, that might be American Indian.    I actually know somebody that works for the Children's Defense Fund in New York and they were doing a health survey, and they were finding a large number of American Indian responses, which they found very unusual. It turned out it was a lot of Asian Indian respondents. The people who are administering the survey just weren't knowledgeable about that group.    The other thing I would like to say about South Asian data, because Asian Indians are the largest subgroup, often data about Asian Indians is applied to South Asians as a whole.    You know, I am sure, as you have heard in testimony yesterday, and this is true for Asian Americans in general, this may mask important differences among the South Asian subgroups.    These are actually the objectives, I think, of the brown paper, which I am not going to go into right now. I am going to actually present now a couple of tables that have data that you were asking about, about the geographic distribution of South Asians.    They are taken from the 2000 census. I will just give you a brief summary of some of the data that is going to be presented in those tables.    There are almost two million South Asians in the United States. South Asians are actually the fastest growing API group, with a growth rate of 106 percent.    They also are the third largest API group, with Asian Indians comprising 16.4 percent of all Asian Pacific Islanders.    Eighty-six percent of South Asians reside in 15 states which, again, I will show you in an upcoming table, and 80 percent of South Asians reside in 30 metropolitan areas, with the largest concentrations in urban areas in the northeast, in California and in Chicago.    The 2000 census also shows that there are growing numbers in other parts of the country, such as the southern and midwestern United States.    So, this table line shows the detailed South Asian subgroups for which there is data available from the 1990 and 2000 census.    The 2000 census, this is the race alone data, because it is most comparable to the 1990 census data.    As you can see, Asian Indians had a pretty significant growth rate, and the same growth rate as South Asians as a whole have 106 percent, with almost 1.7 million in 2000.    For Bangladeshis, you can see they had a very, very marked growth rate of 249 percent. That would be a difference that would be masked if we didn't have the disaggregated data.    For Pakistanis, also, significant growth rate, a little bit lower, of 89 percent. For people from Sri Lanka, about 20,000 total throughout the United States, and about an 84 percent growth rate. Again, almost two million South Asians.    This next table shows the 15 states with the largest number of South Asians. California is the state with the largest, followed then by New York and New Jersey. Texas is next followed by Illinois, Florida, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Virginia, Maryland, Georgia, Massachusetts, Ohio, North Carolina and Washington.    You can see there are also some variations among where the subgroups live. For example, almost two thirds of the Bangladeshi population lives in the New York state. So, you know that a lot of the growth that occurred is most likely in that area.    As well as, then, for Pakistanis, a large majority of the community lives in California, New York, New Jersey, Texas and Illinois.    So, this gives you a little bit of sense of the distribution of South Asians throughout these 15 states and, again, 86 percent of all South Asians live in these 15 states.    Also, then, to give you a sense of how South Asians are distributed in metropolitan areas, the highest concentration is in the New York, northern New Jersey, Long Island, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania area, with a little less than 500,000 South Asians living in that area.    That is followed, then, by the San Francisco are has about 150,000, Los Angeles also figures to have a large number, and about 120,000 total, and then Chicago, as well, has a significant population.    You can also see there are significant populations in other areas. I apologize, this is sort of a large table, so it is broken up into two slides.      Atlanta also has a pretty large population, Florida, the Miami Ft. Lauderdale area. Seattle also has a pretty large population, parts of the midwest like Minneapolis.    I won't read them all, but it gives you, again, a sense of the geographic distribution of South Asians, both according to state and according to place.      I am also going to then present a couple of figures that have additional key demographic information. Unfortunately, some of this data is from the 1990 census, and it is only for Asian Indians. Again, it is being applied to South Asians as a whole, and may mask some important differences.    The median age of Asian Indians, according to the 1990 census, is 29.4 years. There is a slightly higher male proportion, 54 percent men and 46 percent women.    The majority are foreign born, according to the 1990 census, but with a large growth rate, it could be a larger proportion of foreign born in 2000.    Even though it is an emerging, recently, group, it is important to keep in mind that there is a sizeable second generation population.    Asian Indians are also known for having the highest median family income, of $49,309, but as often happens for communities, it doesn't show what the distribution is of income.    Even though there is a group that is doing very well, it may sort of again mask a significant proportion that isn't doing very well.    Twenty-five percent of Asian Indians live in households with incomes less than $25,000. There is also, I think, a sense that Asian Indians are all English speaking, but a significant proportion is limited English proficient, at 25 percent.    Also, another important statistic is that 21 percent of South Asians lack health insurance. So, this table shows you the age distribution and, as you can see, it is a relatively younger population.     As well, this also shows you the family income distribution. You know, some of the lower income families may not have been captured in the census. I am sure there is a lot of debate and discussion about who gets captured in the census.    Definitely, there is a segment of Asian Indians who are doing very well, because of the 1965 act, which brought in a lot of professionals.    Also, this is the household income distribution of Asian Indians. As I mentioned, 25 percent are in households of $25,000 or less.    The brown paper actually has recommendations at the end of each of the chapters that are specific to the health topic that is presented.    We found, as we put all the chapters together in this one report, that there were four sort of cross cutting recommendations that kept appearing.    The first is really the need for reliable data. As I mentioned, some of this data was collected through innovative means, through key informant interviews.    It is needed for South Asians as a whole, as well as it is needed in a disaggregated manner, to understand what differences exist between the subgroups, so that programming and services may be rendered.    More funded research on the health status, needs and concerns of South Asians are needed. Even though this is an extensive report, it was difficult to find data, especially in certain areas.    Then, a focus on culturally appropriate outreach and education, working with existing community-based organizations, which again, I am sure, is something that is common for other Asian American and Pacific Islander communities.    Then, also, this does apply to other Asian Pacific Islander communities but, given changing immigration profiles, not all South Asians are well to do, healthy, wealthy and wise.    People also are coming from countries that do not have concepts of prevention. So, even though the income levels may be high, people may not be accessing important preventive care, such as pap smears, such as routine screenings.    Really, all of this information needs to be considered, and South Asians as a model minority, you know, we have to see where they are doing well, but we also have to look and see where they are not doing well, and see what are the groups in needs. So, thank you so much for this opportunity.    MS. MAYS: Thank you. That was exactly the kind of presentation that the committee has been wanting, because it helps us to get the information about a lot of the different issues that we will be struggling with. I am going to start with questions here.    MS. BREEN: I have two questions, please. Thank you very much for a nice presentation. It was very helpful. Just a couple of things.    You showed us, one of your slides had some data about low income and lack of English proficiency, and those were about 25 percent. I wondered if you had cross tabbed that to see if there was overlap between those groups.    MS. GUPTA: No, we haven't.    MS. BREEN: That might be helpful. That would certainly be useful for the committee to use. Even though this is a population that a lot of it is quite well off and may not be in need of a whole lot of intervention or attention, there is the possibility for rather intense problems of health disparities, I think as you pointed out so nicely in your talk.    Then, could you comment on the point you just made, where people may be coming from countries where prevention isn't a priority, or there isn't a lot of emphasis on prevention?    Are you in a position to talk about campaigns that are or aren't going on, or sort of give us a sense? Prevention is talked about very much in this culture, and just to give us a sense of some of those large countries that you mentioned, maybe India, Bangladesh, you don't have to go through every one, but some sense of that?    MS. GUPTA: Unfortunately, I can't say as much -- do you mean in India, specifically, what kind of prevention or health promotion campaigns are going on?    MS. BREEN: It may depend, by state, there is a possibility for a lot of variation in such a large country as India.    MS. GUPTA: Sure. I think some of it is done nationally and some of it is done on a state and local level.     I mean, like most countries, so many people in India and some of the other South Asian countries live in rural areas, and literacy rates are low in the country in general.    A lot of the education that is done is sort of tailored to the communities, is done more through outreach workers using people who are familiar with those communities.    Unfortunately, I am not an expert on what is going on, sort of, back there. So, unfortunately, I can't speak a lot about that.    MS. BREEN: And you wouldn't happen to know about the medical training, or in the course of medical training, is there an emphasis on prevention?    MS. GUPTA: Not as far as I know, but again, I am not that knowledgeable about that.    MR. LENGERICH: Just two questions to follow up a little bit on that, could you say anything about the communities' perspectives on prevention and their eagerness to adopt that, and not so much the medical system or the system in South Asia, but more about the communities, the individuals here, perspective?      MS. GUPTA: There are a lot of South Asians who work in the health sector. There are a lot of South Asian physicians. As you can see also from this report, there are a lot of South Asians who work in public health.    So, I think there is growing awareness, and I think the community-based organizations have increasingly been trying to develop health education materials, trying to develop culturally appropriate messages about prevention. Using also a lot of peer education as well, I think, is really important.    MR. LENGERICH: A second question is, could you talk a little bit about your organization here, and I guess particularly I am interested in its relationship to things like APHA, the American Public Health Association or the Society for Public Health Education, I think it is. How does your group interact with those, and could you make any recommendations in that area?    MS. GUPTA: Well, we try to have our annual meetings in conjunction with APHA, because the people who are part of our list serv and part of our organization are also members of APHA and will tend to go to that meeting.    We sort of, South Asians, since we are a subgroup of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, we try to feed in our information to the Asian Pacific Islander caucus. So, we did a very broad dissemination of the information, a lot of press releases went out. I know the APHA, Nations Health, carried an announcement about our brown paper.     I am not sure as much about the education society, though. I don't think we have made many connections with that, but we have really tried to use the networks that we have to get the information out and try to link with existing organizations.    MR. LENGERICH: Thank you. This is a nice report, very good.    MS. GUPTA: Thank you so much.    MS. MAYS: Let me ask a couple of other questions, some of which, as we think about recommendations, I think understanding a little bit about the questions I am going to raise would be helpful.    Do you have a sense of, if people call the homes of different groups that you have talked about, there is a willingness to participate in research, particularly if it is research that is being conducted by the government?    Do you have a sense of whether or not there are the resources out there, for example, to do the translations, if suddenly I was about to convince them to do all this? Help me understand whether or not I could find people and get interviewers and all of that.    MS. GUPTA: I know a lot of people participated in the census effort. I know SAPHA actually, I think within the Baltimore/DC area, sent out volunteers.    Our resource directory lists a lot of community-based organizations throughout the country, you know, that have developed health materials. So, there is definitely a capacity for doing translations.    I know also with a lot of the post-9-11 hate crimes backlash, the South Asian community was very affected. Some of the public interest legal networks also produced a lot of materials about knowing your rights and what to do in this new environment in different South Asian languages. That capacity definitely exists in terms of translation.    I know here also in Los Angeles the AMCART network is working with the South Asian community. So, we also are hoping on our web site to put up more information about existing research efforts, so that gets widely disseminated.      MS. MAYS: What I would like to do is turn to the audience, and if there is anyone who either wants to ask a question or make comments, please come to the mike and feel free to do that. If you will introduce yourself?    MR. DO: My name is Julian Do, with New California Media. Could you comment on some of these commons, health cares, issues in the South Asian communities?      For example, in the Asian communities, diabetes is one of the main health concerns. What are some of the characteristics in the South Asian communities?      MS. GUPTA: Sure. Actually, in the executive summary of the report, because it is a pretty extensive report, we talk about some of the data highlights.      One of the things that is mentioned in terms of the leading chronic health concerns, are high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity.    The primary cause of mortality in Asian Indians is cardiovascular disease. There is definitely a higher prevalence of this compared to other Asian groups, as well as non-Hispanic whites.    With relation to youth health, Asian American children are two to three times more likely to lack a usual source of health care, and continuity of care, as compared to white children. There is a lot of this information and data within the report.    MS. MAYS: I think we have one copy in the back. Maybe what might be useful is, let's pass it around and let people look at it as we move along.    Gracie, do we have one in the back, an extra report? Why don't you pass it around. Do you have any other questions, comments?    I want to thank you very much. This has been very useful for the committee and we really appreciate your sharing these with us.    Again, I think they have -- you will be going into publication again?    MS. GUPTA: Yes, we are doing a reprint. We had a very enthusiastic response, so we are just in the process of doing that.    MS. MAYS: Okay, thank you. Let me take about a one-minute break, because I want to consult with Dr. Kagawa Singer, and then we will start again.    [Brief recess.]    MS. MAYS: Okay, folks, I think we are going to get started again.    MS. THEA: Hi, My name is Jo Thea(?). I am actually from the South Asian Network. I am a program assistant for the anti-violence project.    MR. KURAMOTO: I am Jack Kuramoto. I am with Magna Systems, and I am the NCVHS web master.    MS. PARIK: Hi, I am Puna Parik(?). I am from the South Asian Network. I am an intern and I just finished my MPH.     Agenda Item: Report of South Asian Network.    MS. UPADHYAH: Good morning, everybody. My name is Perdita Upadhyah, and I am the director of programs with the South Asian Network.    The South Asian Network is a non-profit organization which is based in Cerritos Artesia, and we are working with the South Asian community in Southern California.    As I proceed with my presentation, I will just kind of run everybody through the different programs that we have.    We do a lot of work in working with the uninsured South Asian community and the undocumented South Asian population, helping them access health care services.    We do a lot of work around domestic violence within the South Asian community. We are working on anti-discrimination and hate crime issues, especially after September 11.    It is the only non-profit organization right now in Southern California that is working with the South Asian community.    So, basically we are addressing the needs of the community, which is very fluid. It is, at times, very challenging, because there are no other organizations right now, and we try to work with the community and try to solve, I would say, as many problems as we can.    It is a very fast, emerging population and I am sure when Lelam had her presentation, she must have kind of given the census data that we saw.     It is right now the third largest growing population in America. I would just kind of talk about -- I will be focusing my presentation on experiences that we have had in working with this community, especially in accessing health care services, and when we are designing programs for funding, the problems that we run through because of the lack of data, to substantiate the problems that we see.    We face a huge problem when we try to substantiate the issues we want to kind of express in the proposals and grants, because we don't have enough data to support the problems that we actually see that are happening in the community.    I think I just want to introduce the South Asian countries, and what are the countries that we are looking at when we say South Asia.    We look at seven countries, and they consist of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.    So, these are the seven countries that make up South Asia. At the South Asian network, the board has eight on the board of directors. They come from all these different countries.    They are all first generation immigrants. The staff has people from all these countries except Sri Lanka. The community organizers that we have, who we use to do outreach and who help us to organize the community, come from all seven countries.    So, that is basically how the South Asian Network has expressed its diversity as far as the seven South Asian countries are concerned.    MS. BREEN: Excuse me, when you say countries of origin, are they all immigrants?    MS. UPADHYAH: Yes, they are all immigrants. So, even on the board level, the board members are all first generation immigrants from all these different countries. The staff as well, we are all immigrants, and we are working with the South Asian immigrant community.    Amongst the many health programs that we have for the South Asian population, we do a lot of work around trying to help the uninsured and the undocumented community get access to health care services.    We try to get them enrolled into the MediCal program, the healthy families program. We do a lot of work around education and prevention of breast cancer for the South Asian women.    Again, for the uninsured women who are not able to have mammograms and cannot do it because either they have problems in accessing services, or just basically because they are not insured.    We do some amount of work around HIV/AIDS for South Asian youth, and Judy is organizing that program. We have presentations and workshops at different schools and different South Asian associations for the South Asian community.      We do a lot of work also around domestic violence, which we do look upon as a health issue, and we try to get children that do not have insurance and come from low income homes enrolled into the healthy family program.    Some of the problems we have seen in our scope of work, and working with the community is barriers to accessing health care services.    We find ourselves sometimes in a situation where we say, how can we help the community that has so many issues in accessing health care services.     The prominent points that I think we kind of keep discussing all the time would be language barriers, because there is this myth that the South Asian communities is made up of doctors, lawyers, engineers and computer technicians and computer masters, which I think is a very wrong myth.     The group that we are working with, we don't see them coming from any of these classifications. They are all new immigrants. A very large population doesn't speak English. They just speak only their native language.     So, we see that language is a huge barrier for these groups to be accessing health care services. The other problem that we have seen is that not many hospitals and not many clinics seem to be having services of language interpretation.    So, we get calls from a lot of hospitals and clinics asking us to be interpreters for the clients. You know, many times when we tell the clients to kind of seek services, their response is, but we don't speak English and we don't find people in hospitals and clinics that could help us.    The other problem we have seen is transportation.    MS. MAYS: Can I ask you a language question before you move on? You showed us all the different -- I think it was like 10 different areas -- Nepal, Pakistan -- now when you have to translate, I don't know how similar or different the languages are for all those groups. Can you try to give us an idea of, can a person who is from Pakistan, then, translate for somebody who is from Nepal or Bangladesh? How difficult is this? Tell us about translation needs.    MS. UPADHYAH: If you look at all of South Asia, it is only in India, we are looking at almost, I think, about 100 to 150 dialects, just in India.    So, in the office, the way we have done it is, we have selected seven major South Asian languages. So, when we say seven major South Asian languages, we are looking at each language from the seven countries.    If we do get calls inside the office for assistance, for interpretation, in any one of those seven languages, we have staff that speak all the languages.      If we happen to get services for any of the languages that are not available in house, we try to get volunteers or board members who speak that language.    So, we look at seven major languages and, amongst the South Asian community, Hindi cuts across the borders. Everybody understands Hindi.    So, that is a common language, Hindi and Urdu. Urdu is spoken more by people from Pakistan, and Hindi, of course, is the dialect in India. So, Hindi cuts across all South Asian countries, and that is a very common language which people can understand.    The other major problem that we have seen is transportation, because not all women drive. They are very intimidated in taking the bus services. They are new immigrants who don't know their way out in the city, especially in a city like Los Angeles, which is so huge. They are just scared to take any kind of public transport, go for medical check ups.    The husbands are working two to three jobs a day. They can't afford to take time off to take their wives to the hospital. So, transportation, again, is a major problem.    Lack of regular health care providers, fear of results. This is a very interesting thing that we have seen. People are generally scared to go in for a medical check up.    It might, again, go back, when we look at the cultural nuances in South Asia. Normally, you really don't go for physical check ups unless you are really sick. So, there is a lack of preventive orientation, which the immigrant community seems to be carrying over here as well, especially for the woman, who is considered the care taker of the family.    She often is so busy taking care of the house and her family and children that she doesn't realize that she needs to have a medical check up, and that is where we are trying to orient the women, trying to make them understand that they should be careful about their own health, if they want a healthy family, or if they want their children and the whole family's well being to be take care of, it is very, very crucial that women start taking care of their own health.    Problems of navigating the health care system, it is just way too difficult for them to comprehend. How do they navigate the health system?    If they get sick, even worse, if they don't have insurance or, even still worse, if they are undocumented, what happens? Where do they go? How do they navigate the health care system? Who provides services that they require?    Lack of language information. Sometimes it does really kind of shock us because we are told that all hospitals and clinics should be having interpreters to help clients with different interpretation services.    In reality, that doesn't seem to be the case. We have had families where children have helped as interpreters, trying to interpret what is happening with the mother or with the father to the medical care providers.    If it happens to be a situation where they don't have children that are grown, who speak English, these people have nobody to interpret for them.    This is, again, another issue that I think is a serious problem and I hope we can do something about it.    MS. BREEN: Could I ask you a question about that? You said you were told that there would be interpreters. Is there a state law in California? Is there an understanding that hospitals should provide those services? What did you mean by that?     MS. UPADHYAH: Well, what we have been told, and also when we have had discussions with other non-profit organizations that are working around health issues, it seems that there is a law, that you need to have interpreters that can help you get services in different languages.     We have seen this not only in the hospitals, but we have seen it also in the court system, when we have had victims of domestic violence go to court.      They haven't been able to receive services in the languages that they are looking for. So, we in the office find ourselves driving clients to court, helping them with the interpretation with the judges and everybody, trying to interpret languages for the clients with hospitals and with clinics, and it is a project by itself, you know. So, that is one problem that we have seen.    Very few culturally competent providers. There have been cases where clients have been sick and have been hospitalized, but we are always trying to figure out if there are South Asian doctors or South Asian nurses that are present in the hospitals that could kind of explain the situation of the clients in a more culturally appropriate way. That is, again, where we see problems, when clients actually go to seek health care services.    MS. MAYS: Before you leave that point, can you tell us, give us some examples of what you mean by that? Does it mean that -- I don't know, if it was a woman, if her husband should be there?    Kind of frame it so that we understand in the sense of, if we were to make recommendations, what some of those culturally competent needs are either in the client physician health care provider interaction, or in a hospitalization setting?    MS. UPADHYAH: When we say culturally competent, I think first and foremost we are talking about the language, of course.     The second thing, what we are looking at is, you know, just trying to explain to the client what is actually happening with him or her in a way whereby he or she can understand it.    What we have is seen is, because we do get calls from hospitals where we have doctors on a three-way call, or sometimes even social workers and even nurses with staff in the South Asian network and the client on a three-way call, trying to explain the client situation and make her understand better that this is what is happening and this is what she has to do, and the process of her medication and everything. So, just a way of, I think, trying to figure out how best you can work with the client.    Another thing we have started doing very recently is having cultural competency training, especially in the field of domestic violence.    We saw a big problem even when women were being beaten up and they were calling 911, and they were getting assistance from the law enforcement. There were issues that were coming out.     I mean, we are talking about a whole new culture that is very different. So, I think it is important to start having some cultural trainings around cultural nuances which will help the client as well as the providers, be it the health or be it the law enforcement, just any services, keeping in mind the growth of the South Asian population.    Of course, a really big problem, which I did mention in the very beginning, that we see is, looking at all these issues that we face on a daily basis, the feedback that keeps coming from the community, we do a lot of extensive outreach into the South Asian community.    We have a group of about eight community organizers. The outreach is focused basically in places of worship. We do a lot of outreach in mosques, temples, community and religious events.    So, when we look at the feedback that we get about the problems that the community is having around health issues, the lack of awareness around issues related to cardiovascular issues, diabetes -- which is killing a lot of South Asians right now -- just all kinds of health issues and accessing health care services.    The basic line, what we feel we are lacking, is data. We just don't seem to be having enough research done on this population that can actually substantiate the work that needs to be done for the well being of the South Asian community.    Even in the office, many times when I am sitting down to write grants, I have a problem, because it is all statistics, and we have nothing to claim.    I think the only thing we have to claim right now is the brown paper, that Lelam was involved in. That is the first research of any kind that has been done on the South Asian community.    It is still very limited. If you look at the population of the South Asians right now in America, the brown paper, I think, is just the first step.    There are still many issues that need to be considered, and we always find ourselves struggling, when you are trying to convince funding agencies, or even when you are trying to convince health care providers, of what the community is actually experiencing.    For example, when the budgets were kind of cut and the county decided to close down 12 of the PPP clinics, we are at a loss right now, because we have all this uninsured population that we were referring to all these county clinics.    Now that these 12 clinics have closed, we don't know where to send them. The picture that we see again is, you know, South Asians are very well educated, they don't need these services, they are doing very well. They are all doctors and lawyers and engineers. That is not the case.    I think we need more data and more research into these populations that we are talking about, which are definitely underserved, have no access to health care services.    Even if they do have access, they could be insured. A certain population does have insurance from their companies or they got insurance on their own, but then they have these other problems of language. They have problems of transportation. They have problems of trying to get the issues explained to them in a more culturally and linguistically appropriate way.    So, it is not only the underserved that need these kinds of services. It is just everybody across the spectrum that requires these services.    Going back to the work of the South Asian Network, on the small scale that we are able to work and help the community, some successful factors that we have seen over the last couple of years, through the health programs that we have conducted is, we have seen a really interesting change in the community when we have been able to provide interpreters. Those cases have really been kind of taken care of very well.    Also, involving community and South Asian health experts in planning initiatives, if anybody is planning an initiative for the South Asian community, we have seen that it has worked very well when certain community or health experts have been involved.    Here, again, we are bringing some issues that are related to the community which the planning people may not know.    So, what are those nuances that we have to take care of? What are those issues that need to be addressed to make that particular program successful?      It calls for the involvement of more South Asian people, experts and planners, when developing any program.    Use research data to inform program development. I would again go back to the lack of data and the necessity to have more research conducted on the South Asian community which would, again eventually lead to informing the policy planners and developing people about the kinds of programs that would be important and the kinds of programs that would be a success, because then we are backing it up with a lot of research information.    In short, providers are culturally competent. We have seen this as a success because we are doing it through the office right now, in all areas related to hate crimes.    I just want to kind of back track a little bit here, because we were working on hate crimes prior to September 11, but after September 11, when the backlash was particularly on the South Asian community, we scaled up our activities against hate crimes.    It was interesting to see the effects of hate crimes and what it did to the community in affecting their health.    One area that we saw, it was amazing to see that the outreach that we were doing so well for the community, which was such a success, suffered a huge set back.    The community was very hesitant to talk to the outreach community organizers. They were not willing to divulge too much information.    They were very concerned about giving their home numbers or even their addresses, and we were even asked with questions like, with all that the INS is doing, why do you need all this information. We would rather not give you the information at all.    So, we saw ourselves, September, October, November, December, our outreach was absolutely zero. The community just wanted to have nothing where you would have to give some kind of information.    It took us a long time to kind of go back to them and make them understand that, even though there is the situation of being traumatized, there is the scare that is taking place right now, they still need to exercise their rights and look for health care access.    If you are a victim of domestic violence, don't hesitate in calling the law enforcement people. Nothing is going to happen to you. You need to seek services that are out there.     We built it up pretty well. Then, again, we had the situation where certain countries were made to register. Amongst those countries, two were countries from South Asia, Pakistan and Bangladesh.    So, all Pakistani and Bangladeshi males above the age of 16 had to be at the INS to register. If they didn't, they were detained or deported.    Again, we saw the backlash on the community and what was taking the back seat was, again, the health. They were not going to be accessing health care services, because it was just a situation where they were way too traumatized to be seeking any services, even though a lot of them happened to be green card holders, permanent residents. Even they were afraid to seek services.    The other area where we saw people really scared were the senior citizens. We have senior citizens who are American citizens who were afraid to say, we need these services, because they said, you know, what is going to happen. Who do we give our information to. Will this information used against us.    It has been pretty difficult. The last six or seven months in the office have been really tough, but I presume there will come a time when we see a better situation.    The other thing that I think we wanted to recommend was provide extensive support services. So, what the South Asian Network has done is, because we have our capacity -- you know, we work with very limited staff, only nine of us right now, we don't have the resources for a big office or to be hiring more staff. A lot of work that we do is also voluntary.    So, what we have done is, we have teamed up with other mainstream organizations, API organizations, so that we can build up our network in providing services, because we don't have the kind of capacity that we need, looking at the growth of the South Asian population.    So, we do a lot of work with OCAPICA(?), we do a lot of work with the Asian Pacific American Legal Center, if they need lawyers, if they need attorneys for their cases.    We don't have any attorneys or doctors on board or on staff. We are all just community activists. So, the way we build up the office is, we do a lot of referrals with other mainstream organizations and assure that the clients get services, even though we don't have the capacity in house.    So, when I see extensive support services, I think it would be important for everybody who is interested in working with the South Asian group to be providing those support services. That is just one of my recommendations.    If we go back to this issue of, what is happening to the community right now, as far as health is concerned, definitely the budget cuts have been a huge disaster, especially with the closure of the clinics.    We are still seeing difficulty in conducting outreach, as a backlash of 911, and then again with the new rules that have come up as far as the registration issues are concerned.    We have seen limited access for information regarding health care services to the community being kind of hit again.    We knew that there was very little information for the community, especially when we talked about even education materials. We see nothing in South Asian languages.    What we are doing right now is, we are picking up materials from other organizations and translating it in house, so that the community gets more access to information.    We have developed brochures on breast cancer education and awareness in I think about seven South Asian languages. We have developed brochures and information materials on domestic violence in all seven languages.    We have materials in relation to hate crimes, basically all the programs and whatever we feel is important to get out to the community, looking at the language barrier that exists. We translate all those materials into South Asian languages.    It does kind of take a lot from us because we don't have resources. We do it with the budget that we have or on a limited basis, but I think when putting a program in place, and especially for organizations like universities and funding agencies, when they are looking at the whole spectrum of the community that we are working with, it does seem important to develop materials in different South Asian languages, too, to ensure access to information, because of the language barriers that we are talking about.    Right now, we do see a lot of fear and suspicion in seeking any kind of services, where personal information is required.    This could be a problem if we do decide to have research at any given point in time, because it might call for getting the community together, getting more information out of them, having to spend time with them and talking to them about their personal issues, especially in relation to health.    So, we might also have to try building bridges to the community, if we do decide to have some kind of a survey or research or a need assessment done.    How do we build the confidence that that information is going to be used for their betterment, and the objective, of course, is definitely to develop programs that could be helpful to the South Asian community.    In the given climate right now, this could be a problem, and I think we need to find ways of working around it.    I did mention earlier there is hesitancy and unwillingness to divulge any kind of personal information. There is also lack of information regarding registration affecting even documented South Asians.    I would again go back to this climate of fear and suspicion, where it is not only the undocumented group that is feeling insecure right now. Even documented people are feeling insecure.    So, how do we bridge this gap and kind of convince them that we are here to make a difference in their lives and to help them, rather than have them look upon us as people they do not trust.    I think when we talk about the whole gamut of having surveys and conducting research, we need to kind of take this into consideration.     It might change if we see the political climate change, but if it turns out to be even more difficult than we are seeing right now, that would be a major challenge to conduct any kind of research within the community.     I think basically I just kind of summed up the problems that we see, and some of the successes. If there are any questions?     MS. MAYS: Thank you very much. What we will do is, we will start with questions from the panel here, and then we will move to the audience. Any of my colleagues?    MR. LENGERICH: Thank you, a very nice presentation and very informative. You had mentioned specifically a breast screening program, and I guess I thought of the CDC program that is available to low income women.    I guess I would like to just broaden that and ask you a question about that and that is, what is your interaction, then, or what recommendations would you make in terms of your interaction with the national programs that are there and available to provide health services, such as a breast cancer program for the women of South Asian descent.    MS. UPADHYAH: What we are doing right now with the breast education program is, we are working very closely with BCDP, the Breast Cancer Early Detection Program.    We have referral services for the South Asian women who do show an interest to have a mammogram done, especially uninsured women 40 and above. That is the group that we are working with.     We call up the BCDP office and try to get them free mammogram screening if they come from really low income families.    Otherwise, the situation is it will have to be a very nominal amount to get the mammograms done, and the follow up is done in house by the office. We keep calling them up to ask what is happening, do they need any kind of services.      What we have seen in the area of beast cancer is there is a complete lack of awareness. Also, we need to look at it from the cultural issues in South Asia. In South Asia, having a mammogram every year is not considered important. They don't do it. They just don't do it.    So, when they move here and we are trying to make them understand the reason to do it, it is already a challenge for them to understand why do they need to have a mammogram once a year.    The other thing we have seen, it is again cultural issues where there is fear of the report, and there is also a lot of shyness, because they don't want to be exposing themselves, especially to male doctors.    This has become an issue where we have kind of insisted with the women that they need to go for a mammogram and the first question is, is it going to be a woman who is going to do it. If it is going to be a man, no, they will not go.      So, these are the cultural issues that I am talking about. So, I think it is just the awareness, and we might not be able to have women providers all the time, but just the basic importance of making them aware that they need to have a mammogram. They have to go back once a year, especially if they are above 40.     It is something we need to start with and, what I can see is, there is a lack of education materials. There are no materials for us to put out for them and say, read this, or call up these numbers, or these are agencies that can help you, these are organizations that can help you whether you are uninsured or you are undocumented.    Right now, what has happened is we have been able to kind of, you know, build up relations with a lot of organizations that are willing to take even undocumented people, which I think is extremely important for us.    I think it is just basically trying to educate the South Asian community from the very beginning about the importance, and this, I feel, can be done only when we have appropriate materials that are translated for them to see.      You know, even though there are ads on the television and there are ads on the radio, we are talking about families that might not even be having a TV, to be frank with everybody in the room. That is the group that we are working with.    They don't have time and they might not even be owning a television. Even if they do, they don't understand the language.    If we are looking at interpretation being provided by children of family members, that could not be convincing enough for them. They need education that is coming to them from more convincing groups or more convincing people.    I would suggest just going back and trying to get more materials and some programs to educate the women.    MR. LENGERICH: Thank you. I would like to ask a second question, if I could, and that relates to the data part that you had mentioned, and actually, this has two parts.    One is, you mentioned that you need more data. Can you give us a sense of what sort of data would be most useful, and I guess two broad categories would be the national data, census data, that the national government would collect, which probably wouldn't be very specific about your local communities, or is it local community data that you would be in most need of.    Then this follow up question is, so if you have that data, do you have people who are trained and could use it, or is part of what would be beneficial also be training programs for the use of health data?    MS. UPADHYAH: I think I would look at it both ways. Definitely, the data will help us plan better programs, and also help to know the need of the community.    I think right now the work that we are doing, I wouldn't say we are assuming the programs that we are developing. It is information that is coming from the community and our work with them on a daily basis, and our interaction with the groups that we are working with, which is making us understand that these particular programs are important.    If you have a community event of about 100 women and you throw in a question about mammogram, and you have about 70 hands that go up saying that we don't know what a mammogram is, or the importance of why we need to have one, but then you don't have data to substantiate that when you kind of put it in front of policy planners, or even in front of funding agencies that are looking for statistics all the time, how do you get your word across to them and make them understand that it is a problem?    That is where I think I see that the communities needs would be better addressed if we had some mechanisms to get the research in place, and it would definitely help a lot of agencies, South Asian agencies as well as funding agencies, as well as program planners and developers, to develop programs actually addressing the needs of the community, rather than just assume and say this could be a problem.    MR. LENGERICH: The second part of that question had to do with the users of the data. So, do you have people that are trained and experts at using the data, or is it also the training programs that you are using?    MS. UPADHYAH: I think we need a lot of training. Going back again, I would say the only data we have seen right now, which is very specific, is the brown paper that has come out by a group of South Asian individuals who thought it was time that we did something about it.    We do need training programs. I think this would be across the board for all South Asian organizations, as well as other organizations that are hoping to work with this community. It calls for a lot of training programs on how to use the data.    MS. MAYS: Questions from the audience? Julian, can I ask you just to comment quickly on the project that New California is involved in, that is attempting to bring this information about the right to translators? Maybe you can share just a little bit about it.    MR. DO: A pleasure. New California Media is just a network of ethnic medias in the state, and we are actually going national this year.    We were fortunate to have a generous grant from the California Endowment to do a campaign on language access. This is a two-year campaign.    On top of that, we also do a survey in 12 different languages of the health care status of the different communities, and the South Asian community is one of the focuses.    One of the things in this campaign that we are doing is to raise the awareness that there is actually a federal and also state laws that would allow patients rights, that you can visit any medical institutions and you can actually ask for an interpreter, because it is your right.    Whether that service or services are available yet or not, it is sort of a chicken and egg situation. If you don't ask for it, then people won't know about it and the state policy makers will not take that into consideration to allocate resources for this.    So, we are launching this campaign in June, and we will have a survey done and, once that is done, we would like to make that available to everyone.    Actually, I have one question, if I may. You have a breakdown of different communities in the South Asian group, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and so on. Could you comment on if there is a breakdown as to the severity of health care disparities in these groups?     MS. UPADHYAH: I think when we look at the South Asian community, one group that we have seen the disparity, I would say, because of the language, also because of socioeconomic reasons, would be the Bangladeshi community.    There are communities that don't speak any other language but Bangla. We don't have the exact figures, but we are told that there are something like about 10,000 Bangladeshis that live in Koreatown, a very large population in Koreatown.    There is a significant population, again, toward the Hawthorne Inglewood area, but the larger population is in Koreatown.    This is one group within the South Asian communities that we see, economically as well, and with language barriers, truly need.    If we talk about the disparity, I think we would want to see much more with the Bangladesh community also, as opposed to the other communities.     MS. MAYS: Great. On behalf of the committee, I really want to thank you.      MS. FOONG: Good morning. My name is Hiang Foong(?). I work with a program known as Pals for Health(?). We have been, for the past 10 years, actually working to improve language access issues in the Los Angeles and Orange County area. Good morning, Perdita. I have several questions for you, if I may.    When you were referring to health care providers as well as health care facilities that were required by particular laws to offer interpreters to limited English proficient South Asians, or anyone else, for that matter, that are LEP, were you referring to Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, that requires that providers that receive federal funding offer meaningful access to patients who do not speak English very well? Is that what you were referring to?    MS. UPADHYAH: I was just kind of referring to the issues that we have had these discussions before. I mean, when a hospital like Cedars Sinai calls us and says, we want your services for interpretation, then we are wondering, don't they have interpreters?    Those clients that have gone and asked for interpreters are calling back and saying, there is nobody that speaks the language.    I am not very aware of the rights that you are talking about, but is it clear?    MS. FOONG: Yes, I guess that probably would apply in terms of the civil rights act, that providers or researchers, or anyone that receives federal funds are required to offer meaningful access to health care services, and that has been deciphered by the office for civil rights to mean the provision of health care interpreters, and also materials that are translated for individuals that are in the service area of the health care system.    Now, the two other questions I have for Perdita, if I may are, do you think that limited English proficient South Asians are aware that there are federal as well as state guidelines, in the state of California, that actually allow them to ask for interpreters from their health care providers?    MS. UPADHYAH: They are aware about that. In fact, we keep telling them this, too. We don't only get calls from hospitals but even from social workers because they say, we can't understand what the client is trying to say and what do we do.    So, the community is aware that it is their right, but they don't get the services when they ask for it.    MS. FOONG: I guess my last question to you is, what do you recommend could and should be done to increase the awareness of health care providers about federal as well as state guidelines around the provision of health care interpreters?    MS. UPADHYAH: I think we just need to be having more advocacy programs, trying to make them understand that this is a client's right, and there have to be provisions made in hospitals and clinics and all social service providing agencies that, if it is a right of a client, they need to make provisions to meet those rights, and how they make the provisions would be for them to kind of come up with, strategies.    I think it calls for a lot of advocacy campaign, because we are not seeing it only in the health sector. We are seeing it even in the court system.    I mentioned previously, victims of domestic violence have been told to appear in court, but they have nobody to help them with the interpretation.    We have very limited court interpreters in the South Asian language. They are driving from one court to the other and you can't get them when this particular client has been called.    So, staff from the office are providing interpretation in court for the domestic victim clients. So, I think we are seeing it more and more.    We may be also seeing it because, again, I would see the population as increasing. It is growing really fast, and maybe the service providing agencies are not able to comprehend what strategies they need to come up with such a fast emerging population to ensure those services are met.    MS. FOONG: I guess to sum it up, you are recommending that more advocacy and training for health care providers and administrators?    MS. UPADHYAH: Yes.    MS. MAYS: Any other questions before we move on? In terms of the Civil Rights Act, can you say specifically which one it is?    MS. FOONG: It is the Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Also, I think back in I believe the year 2000, the Executive Order was issued by then-President Clinton, EO13166, that also requested that federal agencies provide a plan of how they are approaching the needs of residents in this country in a culturally and linguistically appropriate manner.    The Civil Rights Act, 1964, Title IV of the Civil Rights Act, deciphered by the Office of Civil Rights, to mean that, under the clause of national origin, individuals who are limited English proficient are allowed to ask for interpreters to be able to have meaningful communication with their health care providers.    MS. MAYS: Great, thank you very much. Could I just ask one more question in regards to that? Is mental health included under health?    MS. FOONG: Actually, it covers any -- when they refer to federal fund recipient, either you are a researcher, if you are conducting a clinical trial, if you are a lab that is doing blood, if you receive any kind of federal funding from MediCal, Medicare on down, it covers.    So, it follows the trail of money. So, if you get a dollar from the feds, you are required to offer meaningful access to all individuals to the services that you offer funded by the federal government. So, that includes mental health if they do receive funds from the federal government.    MS. MAYS: Perfect. Okay, any others? Okay, we thank you because your presentation has not only provided us with information, but I think provided us with food for thought about what the recommendations need to be.    So, we are very appreciative of both what you presented and the discussion that it sparked. So, it has been very helpful.    MS. UPADHYAH: Thank you so much for giving the South Asian Network this opportunity, and we would be only happy to help you in the future.    MS. MAYS: Great, thank you. Our next presenter is going to be Dr. Kagawa Singer. We kind of changed things around a little bit, but we know she is here and I think has a power point presentation there, and we will get a little help.    Before she begins, one of the things I would like to do is, on behalf of the committee, to officially in the record make sure that we thank her.     Part of the organizing of -- if you haven't noticed, she is hugging everybody out here. That should tell you something about the connections that she has, and she has been very generous, working back and forth on this.    Both in terms of our ability to be able to distribute information as well as our ability to be able to reach out to some of the communities that we reached out to, it has only happened because of my colleague.    So, we really do want to thank you, because the quality of our hearing has been tremendous. What individuals have brought to us, I mean, we are honored to have received.    I feel as if we didn't get just a fact, but what we have gotten is their experience. I think what that is going to do is to help us to translate that into recommendations that we hope then will be translated into something that can make a difference.    So, I want to thank you very much for the time out of your life of work to help us to pull this hearing together. So, thank you very much.    Let me introduce you. While we are having a love fest, let me make sure everybody else does know officially who you are, and that it is also in the record.    Dr. Kagawa-Singer is an associate professor here in the school of public health, in the community health sciences department.    In addition, she is the principal investigator for the Southern California region of the Minority Training -- I am trying to get all the letters --    MS. KAGAWA-SINGER: Minority Cancer Control Research and Training Program.      MS. MAYS: Thank you. For those of you who don't know about that, I suggest that you catch her and talk with her about it.    Part of it is really dedicated to training young professionals to work in this area. She is also a member of AMCART, which you have heard referred to before. I could go on with all the different things that she is involved in.      I think she doesn't get sleep because of these involvements, but we are very happy to have her here, because part of what she is going to help us do is talk about some of the populations who, either because of size or geography, experience this lack of data. Thank you.     Agenda Item: Presentation by Dr. Kagawa-Singer.      MS. KAGAWA-SINGER: Thank you, and good morning, Madam Chair and members of the committee. It really is a very exciting opportunity for all of us to be here, and yes, I do know I think everybody here.    That is part of the issue, is because we don't have a very large body of researchers and community workers because of lack of funds, and the lack of funds have to do with the lack of data, so that we can't advocate as strongly as our needs warrant.    I apologize for being late this morning for multiple reasons, one of which was a technical difficulty. So, I have given you what is supposed to be one of the slides, and it has the Asian and Pacific Islander classification.    To the right of Asian you can write 32, which is what is listed there, and for Pacific Islanders, 22 groups. The ones that are supposed to be in red, but you will see it in a more faded type there, are Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese and Cambodian.    Asian Indians, as you have heard, are one of the largest API groups. However, I don't have it shaded because of the sampling issues and the lack of data that occurs in that community.    So, the six shaded ones on Asian -- Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Cambodian, and then Pacific Islanders, Hawaiian and Samoan -- are about the only ones that we have any data on.    So, what I will be reporting on primarily today are the about 28 other groups.    MS. BREEN: Now, what is the difference between the red and the green?    MS. KAGAWA-SINGER: Oh, you have the red and the green? Well, the red are the ones that we usually have data on. The greens are sometimes, and beginning to emerge.    MS. BREEN: Does that correspond to the size of the population?    MS. KAGAWA-SINGER: Not always, but usually. Like Samoans aren't really large, but because they have been able to advocate and they have some mechanisms to get some data, and there have been two funded studies on them, we have some data.    So, amongst those -- there are 54 in this group, and this came from the Census when people write in what their ethnicity is.    There are more than these, as we go into the subgroups within. For example, within the Laotian, there will be Hmong, Myan, there are about 12 different groups within Laotian, each with a different language.    So, within these groups, we have over 100 languages. This creates multiple problems, as you have heard over the last day and a half.    Probably the one blow that the API population took was the 1985 Heckler report on black and minority health. In there it states, the Asian Pacific Islander minority, in aggregate -- and this is the critical statement, in aggregate -- is healthier than all racial ethnic groups in the United States, including whites.    That was our death knell for any research in data collection, because the feeling was at that point, when the ethnic identifiers came out, it was to track disparities, either in health, social welfare, any of the areas.     Because what was seen in aggregate for Asian Pacific Islanders, they felt there was no problem, and therefore, we didn't need any attention and, therefore, we won't collect any data on us, which is what happened.    You can also see this was 1985. Now, they were using data from the 1970s, in which the only data that they collected at that time were Chinese, Japanese and I think Korean, maybe.    In the intervening time -- this also came up in a recent publication from the National Cancer Institute, in which they were talking about using Census data to try to calculate rates, and Nancy, perhaps you might be able to shed some light on this, but they were using for everyone, because of the problems with the 2000 census data and multiple races and all of that, that could be checked off, and the comparability, they were going to use 1975 census data.      Considering the Asian Pacific Islander population, as everyone sitting here is well aware, we have grown over about 400 percent since then.    So, anything that could have been calculated on populations at that point in time are useless to us at this point in time.    The other was that, well, there weren't enough numbers in 1975, population-wise, to figure out rates. . Therefore, we get left out of tables all the time. There is insufficient data. This becomes the mantra, unfortunately, for all of us who do research in API, or try to advocate for services.    This is a word that I have come up with in this class that I teach on API health, and it is my own language. What it stands for is the opening sentence in every article that you will read on API health.     So, we start out with, there is a lack of data but we are going to do the best we can. This is from the 2000 census web site of where APIs live, and this, then, addresses the sampling issues.    When we do population-based sampling on any of the national data bases, you can see that, unless you concentrate on particular geographic areas, you are going to get cell sizes of one, two, and they are going to then drop out of any data analyses, or Asians overall, because nationwide, then, the cells become too small to do anything with.    Then, the phrase at the bottom of most is, data insufficient for analyses, over and over and over again. I will go into that in just a moment for recommendations.    So, at this point in time, I am sure you heard yesterday, we have almost 12 million individuals. What I have broken down, the two or more Asian groups, or two or more API groups, is where we are getting mixed populations because of the intermarriages that are occurring.    That is creating a lot of havoc as well. I am on one study now in which we are looking at ethnic minority populations, and if a person is of mixed heritage -- for instance, Japanese and white, Japanese and black -- they will say, which one do you most identify with.    Some people say, I refuse to declare only one because I am both. They get dropped. They are not eligible for the sample. If they then say white, they are dropped from the sample because we are trying to get Japanese. So, this creates problems as well.    I will start out with my recommendations, and then I will try to back them up. So, the data collection of the small populations -- I will take for example the SEER data base as an example of one that has the possibility of a model for collecting small samples in sufficient numbers that we might be able to utilize them.    The other is in language. Over two thirds of our population, if you look at that list of 54 that you have in front of you, over two thirds of them are non-English speaking, and over a third of them are what are called linguistically isolated. So, there is no one over the age of 14 who speaks English.    We also run into the problem of children, as has been indicated, translating. How many of us who aren't health practitioners can translate medicalese when it is in English?    Then you ask a child to be translating words for medical treatments, or even anatomic sites, in which they don't even know the word for. So, literally, they make it up to try to help their parent out, and it has had some quite disastrous results.    Potentially, using community-based clinic utilization and outcome information for monolingual, low income populations, this is who they serve. They do extremely well with very little funds, and they could be a model of what could be done or how to access those populations. There are networks of them around the country addressing API groups specifically.    Use of community groups with language capacity for more sophisticated sampling procedures in high concentration areas.    There are a couple of surveys going on now in which they are trying to do, in language, nationally representative sampled groups. This might be a way in which those who are skilled and trained, from our community-based organizations, to be hired on as interviewers, to be able to administer these.      Then, addition of questions to assess acculturation and economic status which we know, especially on the health data bases, the economic aspect is missing, and we lose a lot in being able to look at problems and potential interventions.    As I mentioned, the increase of the API population since 1990, and then if we go back to 1975, as I indicated, the problems there, the growth has been, we are the largest in rate -- not the largest in size, that is the Hispanic Latino population -- but in rate, the API group is still the fastest growing.    In California, besides Hawaii, we were the first state to become a minority majority, so that only 45 percent of our population is now white in California. In Los Angeles, it is even more stark. It is predicted that we will have a 50 percent Latino population here in California by 2050.    So, how we count our minority groups and disaggregating them becomes extremely important for services and health status.    Now, a project that I am involved with -- and Susan Li and Jackie Tran are here, who are the project directors from that project, and we are looking at seven populations here in Los Angeles and Orange County that, except for two of them, have never been in any study or data base.    So, we have had to try to look at how to sample these groups in a way that will have some representativeness of the populations here in California.    I think Paul Ong may have mentioned yesterday how the API populations in California aren't representative of the national API groups, just because we have longer residents here, that we have an older population than the rest of the country.    So, some of those changes will be there, as well as the newer immigrants. Because we are Pacific Rim, we get many more new immigrants.    I purposely put down the single race versus the inclusive, because you can see, even with these very new groups, that there is a significant proportion of them now who are out-marrying, and that we are going to need to be able to capture the differences that are occurring in these populations.    In addition, if you will look at the Thai on the right, the star there, it is because the census data say that there are about 20,000 Thai in Los Angeles Orange, but the community folks say there are closer to 90,000.     So, we know that this occurs in all the populations because of undocumented individuals. In addition, there is still the suspicion, as Perdita indicated, on government folks.    These are primarily refugee countries, in which their relationship with their government is not a positive one. So, if you come as a government official, they look very wary on you, and then welfare reform hit, and 9-11, and all of these, in which the climate for new immigrants to this country is not a friendly one.    So, we get people who then refuse to answer the census, and then don't get counted, even though there has been a lot of outreach to the communities, to educate them about the need for it. There is still that very high level of suspicion.    MS. MAYS: If I can ask you a question, do you know if, when Census was done, the extent to which they participated with community groups to try and get people to participate?    MS. KAGAWA-SINGER: There was extensive outreach, but I said, even in spite of that. The behavioral risk factor survey in California of 2002, we just got the information from the office here in California.    So, there were only 331 respondents who were APIs. Then, again, the proviso at the very end, the director said, but there are not enough observations to do much analysis, when you get for Indonesians a cell of one.    The most, Japanese and Chinese, 78 and 48, so we might be able to do a little bit with that, and those are the ones in red, where there are at least four groups in which we might be able to do something, as long as we don't make it gender specific.    MR. HITCHCOCK: Are those inclusive, the categories with principal race?    MS. KAGAWA-SINGER: These are phone interviews and they self identify. So, I guess it is up to the respondent.    MR. HITCHCOCK: Are these the only guidelines that are allowed?    MS. KAGAWA-SINGER: That I don't know, whether they can pick more than one.      MS. BREEN: It is a federally funded survey.     MS. KAGAWA-SINGER: What is also notable for the behavioral risk factor survey is that, when it is sent back to, is it Washington where it is aggregated -- Atlanta -- when it is sent to Atlanta, it is aggregated as API total.    The only way that I could get, when I have tried to get behavioral risk factor survey by state -- because some of the states do break it out, but CDC and behavioral risk factor survey are only reported as an aggregate number.    When I have asked how do I get a disaggregated number, I thought I could get it from their tapes when they aggregate them. They said, no, you have to call every single state.    So, if we could get data that is at least centralized there, they have it on their tapes. If they could please ask for it in its form like this, and then aggregate it at the central office, that would be of great help to us.    MS. BREEN: Do you want CDC to request the disaggregated data as it is collected from the states, and aggregate it at CDC?    MS. KAGAWA-SINGER: Correct. The other, within Pacific Islanders, Pacific Islanders make up less than five percent of the Asian American Pacific Islander group which is why, on the 2000 census, they are two separate groups now, to begin to look at the within-group variation within Pacific Islanders.    Native Hawaiians make up almost 60 percent of the total Pacific Islander group, but I am sure, as you heard from most every presenter here, we have a bimodal distribution, and this is where the aggregation becomes so detrimental.     We are over-represented at the high and the low end. So, when you aggregate them, these high risk populations become invisible.    We have, for example, within the U.S. total population, 12.5 percent poverty, within the API overall, it is 13 percent, for Japanese it is seven percent, for Laotian it is 51, for Hmong it is 64, and for Cambodians, it is 47 percent poverty rates. You don't see those when you average everyone together.      The leading causes of death are no different than the general population, although Asian American Pacific Islander females are the only ethnic group where breast cancer, or cancer, is the number one cause of death.    So, what do we know about APIs and the smaller groups in general? I am from Berkeley, and this was the view of San Francisco that I would often have, but we have no clue. It is under a fog because there is no data.    We do know, when we do find data that is disaggregated, if you look at the far right, well, white and blacks are on the left, with the black African American group the red, but if you look to the far right, we have Laotians, Guamanians, which are primarily Chamorro, Samoans, and other islanders as high or higher than African Americans.    So, the problems within these populations are really significant, but it is very hard to address these without the data to back up a proposal.     The smoking rates within the API group are also the highest in the country. There are efforts through APCHO and APITAN to try to target these populations, but these numbers are not population based, because we don't have any population based data on these groups.    So do know, from the small studies that have been done, that these are the rates that we are dealing with, and the lung cancer rates are increasing and cardiovascular as well.    I was told, because there are no statistics on APIs and STDs that are easily available, that APIs don't have problems because they don't have sex, but considering that we are probably four fifths of the world -- see, we can be a model.    The down side of that, the reality is that we are what, four fifths of the population of the world, so that might have some indication.    I had very mixed reactions when I saw this drug company ad for sexually transmitted diseases, that there were Asians in the picture. Wow, we made it. Well, maybe not, but at least there is the recognition.    Birth rates, again, look very low, in APIs in California. However, the within group variation, these are the aggregated numbers again, note that. The same with STD rates.    They look very low compared to the other ethnic populations, but we have such variation. For example, going back to the family sizes, for Chinese and Japanese, it tends to be a little over two. For Hmong, it tends to be around 12. So, those kinds of variations aren't visible.    Eating disorders, we really don't know because of the lack of information. Hiang Foong is our resident ex-community expert on translation issues, and it is more than language. It is more than translation. It is the interpretation that we are most in need of for non-English speaking or limited English speaking populations.    Concepts don't translate. Very often I will see in the literature that Asians aren't prevention oriented. It is prevention with the technology that we offer in our medical care system, not prevention for protection of health.    If you think about Asian Pacific Islander health, indigenous health belief structures, it is the yin and the yang, or other types of balance issues, and that you live your life to be in harmony so that you maintain your health.    So, the food you eat, the activities you do, your entire life style is built around prevention illness. So, it is not prevention. So, the linguistic aspect, it is not prevention that they are against, it is unfamiliarity and ignorance at this point in time about the technology.    In Vietnam, about five years ago, perhaps -- Julian Do can correct me -- but I think the expenditure for the health of each individual in Vietnam about 10 years ago was one dollar per person per year.    Prevention doesn't fit into that kind of a framework. All you can do is treat the most emergent illness. I think very similar in India.    I know they are using the acidic acid as one of the tests they are trying throughout the country for cervical cancer screening. So, it is the technology that is the barrier at this point, or knowledge about it.    I had mentioned on my recommendations about acculturation. This slide, I think, is just an example of what we do know that acculturation does.    If you will look at the Japanese on the left, the major portion of the cancer load in Japan is stomach cancer. It is only nine percent in the United States. Colon cancer is much larger. Prostate cancer is the number one for U.S. Japanese males. It doesn't even show up in Japan.    So, the genetic basis doesn't change in that short a time. What does change is acculturation and life style issues. So, we know that five percent of diseases are genetically based, 95 percent is life style.    So, we know that with the new immigrant Asian Pacific Islanders in this country, the disease burden is going to increase dramatically, unless we begin intervening now on education and outreach for prevention services, but that requires we have numbers, and at this point, we don't have any.    MS. MAYS: I am trying to understand why there is not prostate cancer in Japan.    MS. KAGAWA-SINGER: As far as the top five. There will be cancer, but what emerges is that this change in patterns of cancer changed dramatically after one generation in this country.    MS. MAYS: After one generation?    MS. KAGAWA-SINGER: One generation.    MS. MAYS: And it is all like acculturation life style?    MS. KAGAWA-SINGER: Japanese Americans, in Japan, the breast cancer rates are one fourth the rates they are for the United States, for total ethnic. Japanese Americans, in a 2002 report by Deepan(?) and colleagues from USC --      MS. MAYS: And they are first generation; is that what you are saying?    MS. KAGAWA-SINGER: No, I am saying in Japan the rates are one fourth the rates here.    MS. MAYS: No, I meant the ones here.    MS. KAGAWA-SINGER: No, just say the Japanese population overall, which tends to be second and third generation overall, have now -- they predicted in 2000, with 1998 data, that by the year 2000, if the rates continued, that Japanese Americans would have rates higher than white American females, who have the highest rates in the world.    So, in two generations, genetically nothing has changed, but this is what we are predicting, this huge epidemic within the API population for many of these diseases within a short period of time, unless we begin intervening now. Since we don't have numbers, we can't get the money to do the programs to do the outreach.    Similarly, in China, Hong Kong and the United States Chinese, you will notice, again, differences, where colon cancer doesn't show up in China and the relationship, the numbers, change significantly. So, looking at the impact of life style.    The same for Filipinos. What you can't see down there is prostate as well and non-Hodgkins lymphoma is what is up on top, and it doesn't show up in the Philippines.    When we look at outcomes, what is interesting is looking at differences by ethnic group and what impact it may have on treatment outcomes. I just use cancer. That is my particular area, but this happens as well for cardiovascular and diabetes treatment.    For lumpectomy, which is considered breast conserving therapy, the choice of treatment, if the woman is eligible for this choice, for Anglo women, 80 percent choose reconstruction and about the same for lumpectomy, whereas, for the Japanese and Chinese, it is much, much lower. So, does a mastectomy have better outcomes perhaps than lumpectomy, and some of the recent data is kind of controversial on that, but it is showing that there might be a slight advantage to have a mastectomy.    So, could this be one of the reasons? There appear to be cultural reasons for the choices in treatment, and primarily it sort of echoes that Perdito was saying, that these women know that, if they were to have a lumpectomy, then they have to have radiation therapy with it.    Radiation therapy is every day for six weeks, which means that somebody is going to have to drive them in, if they can't drive themselves, or they are going to be, with radiation or with adjuvant chemotherapy, they are just not going to feel as well and they won't be up to par and fulfill their role responsibilities.    So, they say, just do the mastectomy, get it over with and I don't have to go through anything else. I don't have to bother anyone else.    Then we have the issue here in Los Angeles of, when you ask about ethnic group -- and this will be my plug for acculturation -- it is what are they acculturating to.    Then we have the blending that occurs when you have mixed ethnicities, and how does that affect life style choices, and do the categories mean everything that we think they mean if we take all Japanese or all Chinese or all Chamorro.     So, again, my recommendations, then, are for data collection on small populations, the use of community-based clinics, the use of those with language capacity for more sophisticated sampling.    One of the recommendations we had made here in California was for outreach messages and perhaps to contract with the CBOs who specialize in those communities and have 800 numbers that could be directed toward those communities to do information outreach.    They felt that was too expensive. They weren't going to do that. So, instead, I will just put my plug in and my opinion that then the communities are once again without services.    Some examples, this is again from the PATH(?) program and perhaps Susan or Jackie can answer any questions about this, but what we did was to try to figure out how in the world we were going to do outreach to these groups -- this was a CDC Reach(?) 2010 funded grant -- and how we were going to sample on the baseline and follow up surveys.    So, we worked with Paul Ong's center in getting GIS mapping done for each of the communities, so they only represent those over five percent of that particular ethnic population.    As you can see, there are two centers for the Thai community, and those are the seven that I mentioned we were working with.    So, they are in different, somewhat overlapping, areas for the Laotian, Cambodian and Samoan populations, but unique unto themselves as well.     What I would recommend -- let me just go back. On the sampling frame, what we then did was to work with the groups in health and asking them to identify for us where the would most likely get as representative a sample of their populations as possible.    So, for example, the Cambodian group, we asked them to sample by socioeconomic status, by language ability, and by outreach sites for all the groups, and then by age categories.    So, they were to do quota sampling within each of the cells for us, with high, medium and low incomes, monolingual, bilingual, English only, and then outreach sites was up to each community group to identify, where they would most likely get women that represented these various groups.    So, within the Cambodian community, it was generally different temples and markets. For the Laotian community, again, it was temples and also home to home. This community does not have any media. Therefore, they said their outreach had to be done home to home and, due to the nature of the community, that they didn't trust people, that they wouldn't aggregate to do things as a community function. So, you had to go to them individually, and this would only be by people who already were trusted community workers.    For the Tongan, it was, again, in churches, but they also had to look at different ones. For example, the Cambodian, they were primarily Buddhist temples, and for the Tongan, it was Church of Tonga, Methodist, Mormon and Seventh Day Adventists, because they have different populations within the Tongan community, depending on which church you belong to.    So, those were the kinds of within-group variation that we wanted to capture on our sampling plan within each of these areas, and then ask them to map out the area and also select disparate groups, so we could get a mapping of the entire community.    This was another project that I was working on. What I often get from people, when I am working on survey development, is give me two questions on ethnicity.    I would just argue, no, you can't do that, and kind of drop it at that. They will say, give me one acculturation question and I say, well, I can't do that either.    I felt, well, if I keep saying I can't, then they will do what they think is needed, and then it won't get done, one, either at all, or it won't be done in a way that I think is usable.    So, what I came up with are some questions that I think might be able to capture that. This was working with a cancer data set.    So, what I recommend is that you use your usual demographics but then ask, how do you identify your ethnic background or heritage by the OMB categories, plus the cancer tumor registry categories are slightly different. Then, ask them, other than that, to specify.    For place of birth, if not the United States, your age at immigration. For a lot of the health status indicators, your length of time in the United States is a major factor.    Degree of value, pride or identification of your ethnic heritage, specify, and then I put as many as needed, from not at all to completely, and then how much do you identify with the dominant U.S. modern culture, again, on a one to ten, not at all, to completely.    Then it becomes health question specific. Do you know where you can get health care. Do you have a regular doctor for regular check ups, which is one question which is often on, for example, the National Health Interview Survey.      The other question is, when you are sick -- or do you have regular care? They may say no, but when you are sick they may say yes, because they have a care taker that they could go to, or it is the emergency room.    So, how confident do you feel using the health care system, which is often the major barrier. We don't have a logical system. They have to go to multiple places. We separate mental health and physical health which, in Asian and Pacific Islander cultures, doesn't make any sense. You know, you are one person. Why do you have to go to two different practitioners.    How confident do you feel finding the appropriate health care people to talk to. Then, if you don't understand what the provider is recommending, do you feel you can ask questions. Lastly, are you satisfied with the answers.    Many times they will nod that they heard, not that they understood, but that they heard, and then they walk away and they go, I have no clue what he just told me, and then they give me pamphlets to read and it is in English and I can't read it, so they just toss them.    So, if we can address some of those things, maybe we can clear the fog away a little bit and have more opportunities to serve the populations in need. Thank you.    MS. MAYS: Thank you very much. Let me start with the panel. Any questions?      MR. LENGERICH: Thank you very much. First of all, a request. Could we get a copy of your slides? I think that would be very helpful, because they have a lot of good information in there that I wasn't able to capture all that I wanted to in notes. So, if we could get a copy of those, that would be very helpful.    Then, another question had to do with the issue of those changing cancer incidence rates, I assume, after immigration.    I guess I am wondering if we have additional data to show the utilization of health care services after immigration, or the variety of experiences in the health care system after immigration.    I guess I was struck by the prostate cancer as well, and given that prostate cancer occurs late in life, and is present in a large percentage, if not a majority of men, over 70, 75 years of age, I am just wondering how much of this is detection that is coming up on our data now, because it is being detected here, whereas it wasn't being detected in their home country.     I would also like to have some information on the utilization of services, particularly the screening services. Do we have any of that kind of information?    MS. KAGAWA-SINGER: Very little. As I said, it will usually be on only four or five of the multiple groups. The prostate cancer is Japanese, or at least the major shift that has occurred, and that was the largest percentage for Japanese American men.    You will also note that comparable data in Japan does not show prostate cancer. So, we know there is something else going on.     For the other groups, we don't have the information yet, but we definitely know, just like other groups, men underutilize health care.     What we have done with the PATH program and another one I did with the Hmong was to include the men on the breast and cervical cancer screening education, so that they understood why.    What the focus groups we had on that initially said over and over again, when we had the men's focus groups, they said, what about us, what about diabetes, what about hypertension. So, they want to know, but we just don't have the people power to be able to go out and do that kind of education.    You also have a flyer for a conference tomorrow that we are having on API health, and they will go into more detail, if any of you are able to stay for that, on each of the disease categories.    Now, one thing that Perdito, and I think Lelam might have mentioned with the brown paper, that the South Asian population, even though they do have a segment, like Japanese Americans or some of the Asian groups are over-represented at the higher education, the South Asians, as yet, inexplicably, have the highest rates of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, I think equal to African Americans.    Such a large percentage of them are vegetarian. It just doesn't kind of compute. Those of us in the API population are interested in studying that, but there is nothing yet in the literature to explain why. It is documented that it exists, but as to why, it hasn't been addressed yet.    MR. LENGERICH: Just finally, a comment, I share your concern about the BRFSS data. I am involved with a project that is attempting to look at the BRFSS data on a county specific basis.     Those data, I am not sure, but to get county specific data, they have to be requested from each of the individual states. So, we are about to go to each of the states.    I understand the other side of that, that this is a federally supported, but a state-based survey. So, when we get to the issue of small numbers, there is also the proprietariness of that data and how it might get used. So, we are forced to go to each of the states to get their data, so that we can get that county specific data as well.     MS. KAGAWA-SINGER: I guess one more addition on the data is that another major barrier is at NIH, it is institute specific, whether Asian Pacific Islanders are included in minority populations.    Except for ANCART, which was the first Asian American one, and then there is also one in Philadelphia with Grace Maa, but those were the first ones funded.    Within NIH, within NCI, Asian Americans are not eligible for any of the minority training or supplement grants, because we are not a minority. I talked to Dr.Von Eschenbach who told me to write to him about that, which I will do.      There was also another federal project that had asked for definitions of health by ethnic populations. I called up the project officer on it and she said, oh, great, we wanted anthropologists to answer this call, and I am an anthropologist.    I said, but you have African American and Hispanic listed here and I work with the Asian American population, Pacific Islanders.    She said, oh, I am sorry, according to the federal government, you are not a minority. I said, oh, thank you, my whole life I thought I was. You just cleared that up for me.    That was just another door that was closed to us because of that 1985 report, I think. At least, that is where I trace it back to, to the inability.      MS. MAYS: Can I ask you to go back a couple of slides? Yes, right there. I want to make sure I understand for number three, where it says degree of value, pride or identification as.    Walk me through what you are trying to accomplish with this one, just so I can understand. You then say, your ethnicity and heritage and then the person says what they are, and then after that it is -- what is the one to ten, so I understand?    MS. KAGAWA-SINGER: For example, how much is it a part of your personal identity. So, if you are -- well, say, my husband is Viennese and German. The Viennese he doesn't identify with, the Austrian he doesn't, the German he does. If a person is Japanese and Chinese, they may be equally with both.    The dominant U.S. modern culture could also be very high. This goes back to some of the acculturation scales that are bidimensional. So, you can be truly bicultural, where you have high identification -- for example, with me.    I would be highly identified and able to function, I hope, in the dominant society as well as the Japanese American community, and I have very strong identities there.    So, it is not that I have given up my Japanese identity and taken on that, which is called assimilation, but it is being able to be bicultural or multicultural, depending on a person's background.    In Hawaii, my rule is, in Hawaii, it is a minimum of four and then you sort of go from there. So, which one is their identity, of those four. It depends on which day it is and which family member they are with.    How, then, does that -- using that as a proxy, then, of how does that affect perhaps the foods they eat. That goes like here, what I often ask is, how many times have you, in the last seven days, eaten food from the same ethnic group for the last seven days.    If you are from Los Angeles, nobody will raise their hand. You eat Mexican one day, Thai another, Chinese, French. So, those are the kinds of indicators that seem to affect health outcomes.    We know from mental health, the more you have a strong positive identity if you are non-white, then the better your mental health is, depending upon a lot of other indicators, but just as one strong element, that that may be significant.    MS. BREEN: Can I follow up on that? Do you know how this is administered, or are you going to do that? Let me ask about administration first.    So, if somebody had three different ethnic backgrounds in number one, then is that the basis for specifying one through 10? You would go through and do that for four different times, or how does this question get administered?    MS. KAGAWA-SINGER: Yes.    MR. LENGERICH: Then administration, before we get to analysis, then, what about 3B, then? How do you use 3B, then, in the example that you just gave here, that people in Los Angeles wouldn't eat the same food more than once a week, so how would they answer that kind of question?    MS. KAGAWA-SINGER: I wouldn't use food. To me, food is not a good indicator. How much do I identify as an individual with the dominant -- you know, am I able to function comfortably. I would put myself fairly high.    So, your question, then, is how does food affect it or what indicator would that be?    MR. LENGERICH: I guess I was just thinking it seems like there are a lot of local perception of the culture -- the perception of the culture is going to be fairly localized, I think.    So, I am wondering how a person, for instance, who is multi-cultural is going to perceive the U.S. modern culture, particularly in a place like Los Angeles, for example.    MS. BREEN: Isn't that the question? Are you asking people their degree of value, pride and identification in the dominant U.S. modern culture?    MS. KAGAWA-SINGER: Yes.    MS. BREEN: So, as a member of?    MR. LENGERICH: So, what is your interpretation.    MS. BREEN: What do you think the dominant is.     MR. LENGERICH: Yes, what is your interpretation of the dominant U.S. culture.    MS. KAGAWA-SINGER: It is interesting. I have this other acculturation scale, and we had to change it, because there are six minority ethnic groups of color, and then the seven sites also address -- all of them address white American women or European -- Euro American -- women.    All the groups of color had no problem filling out the questionnaire, because one of the first questions was like this one, your ethnic background.      Then the questionnaire went on. The only group that had problems with it were the Euro American women because they said, well, i don't have an ethnicity. So, we had to change that.     That just brought me up to the Hawaiian health survey. They have six groups that they aggregate their data into, but they ask the questions in 31 different ethnic groups, including European, German, Irish, Italian, English as six of the groups.    This is what they are doing in Canada as well. They require people to state their ethnicity. If they are Irish, if they are Scottish, if they are Welsh, they want that put down.    So, we made a similar kind of explanation for that questionnaire, and then people had no problem filling it out.    What they would say in that instance, for 3-A, they would say Irish and Scottish. Then they might put not at all with either of those and 10 on the dominant. You were going to ask a question on analysis?    MR. HITCHCOCK: I was just wondering if there was a scale or if you developed an index, or if you just used these questions.     MS. KAGAWA-SINGER: Not yet, because I have not actually administered it, other than kind of piloting it with people to see if it makes sense.    What I think would be more -- my own personal take on it, which is what I would like to do some work on, as far as research is, for the health acculturation is, how well can you navigate the system.    I think what you have heard in the testimony thus far, that is where the breakdown is. It is not their ethnicity, it is not their language per se, but it is their ability -- our system is so confusing.     In Taiwan, which is a developed country, they don't have appointments. You just go. So, the idea that you make an appointment becomes a barrier, because it is an unfamiliar step in their health care.    So, those kinds of differences, I think, make a difference in ability to utilize our system, or lack thereof.    MS. BREEN: I had a different question. First, I wanted to thank you very much for clarifying the prevention model.    I thought that was very important for us to understand, that it is built into the Asian life style, it is not a high tech thing that comes and you get your screening. It is a very different concept. So, thanks for clarifying that.     I won't say much about it, but just to let you know, the National Cancer Institute is currently struggling with how to measure cancer incidence and mortality using the new 2000 census data and all the bridging issues.     I have been working on a background paper for health disparities, and we have changed that table several times as new data have come in and new techniques have been developed.    I think there are people you could talk to, if you would like to pursue this a little bit more at NCI, because it is not a done deal yet, by any means. They are still working on --    MS. KAGAWA-SINGER: Yes, I talked with Brenda and until we get the 2000 census straightened out -- maybe that would be another recommendation, is in the meantime, always put that caveat in when presenting anything on Asian Pacific Islander data.    MS. BREEN: That would probably make sense. As you know, and probably everyone in this room knows, the populations that are affected most by these movements around with the census data are Asian, Pacific Islanders, Native Americans, Alaska Natives. It is the smaller groups that it creates the biggest apparent change in rates.    So, it is extremely important. I know Brenda is very aware of that and very concerned about it.    MS. BREEN: She has been very supportive.    MS. KAGAWA-SINGER: I am simply delighted that you are talking with her about it.    MS. BREEN: I was interested, and I know you have got two of your data managers, your project managers, here from the new program, the PATH Study, in Los Angeles and Orange County.    I was wondering, it came up yesterday as well, the idea of using administrative data more, which I think is what you meant by the community based clinic, the utilization and outcome information.    I know NCI has had the experience of merging the SEER data with Medicare data, which is a very large administrative data source.    Typically, administrative data bases are not constructed for analysts, and don't necessarily ask the questions that analysts want answered.    I just wanted to know more about your experience with that, and how well it worked out, and sort of how you shaped the data as you needed to, or how you dealt with the costs of merging the data, using the data, a little bit more about your experience, because that might be helpful as a model for thinking about how to use this rich source of data.    It is not population based. I mean, it has a number of random statistical problems down the line, but nevertheless, it may be useful, because we certainly need at least some beginning data on these populations.    MS. KAGAWA-SINGER: On that, I would refer you to, I think, a paper that Jeff Caballero forwarded to the committee.    He is the executive director for APCHO in Oakland, and they have an actually funded project to try and have a common data base amongst their 15 clinics across the country.    Hawaii also has a common data base, but it is more, as you said, administrative and doesn't ask the health questions.    So, they are struggling also with how to incorporate some of their clinical information with the administrative data base. As far as answers, there aren't any yet. Those projects are actually currently going on.    As far as costs and things, we don't have administrative data. It is the populations that we are working with, the communities per se, at this point, and Jackie or Susan, do you want to add anything on that?    MS. BREEN: How about cost?    MS. TRAN: The cost is expensive for a variety of different reasons, from the labor intensiveness of the actual gathering of the data from the community members to the actual data analysis, as well as the cost of creating everything. It can be very simple.     Actually, a lot of the rich data that we have is very qualitative, and it comes in the stories that our community health workers tell us about, and isn't necessarily a survey based information questionnaire.    In taking that data and doing focus groups, and in doing other types of surveys, we are able to get the rich data that we get, but it is also very time intensive because of the translation process, for all of the communities that we work with, and then back translating.    So, it is a whole entire process, in developing the materials and creating the appropriate ways to ask the questions, and then taking that finally into English, to analyze that and to see what impact it has.    A lot of times, it is such small numbers that, like Dr. Kagawa-Singer mentioned, it isn't statistically significant, and then what to do with that data to find more data to support that kind of resource. It is possible. It is just quite an intensive process and it is very costly.    MS. BREEN: Can I just understand your process a little more? It kind of sounded like maybe you worked with the community workers to get some qualitative sense of what was going on in the community, and then did you develop a survey which you consequently or subsequently administered in the community?    MS. TRAN: Yes, we did focus groups and we spoke specifically with the community health workers and then, from that, developed a nice, short survey of 92 questions that was translated, which makes it even longer, to apply within the communities.    Most of our sample sizes are, a majority of them is 180 surveys, which is rather small, but suits the communities, and then the largest is the Hmong, the Vietnamese and Thai, which is 360 surveys.    So, that information then was taken and was inputted into SPSS in access data base form, to be analyzed by the evaluation team.    MS. KAGAWA-SINGER: It is actually double that with our seven groups, because we have a comparison community in Northern California of four of the groups.    MS. BREEN: Would it be possible for us to see a copy of that questionnaire?     MS. TRAN: Most definitely, I can have that sent via e mail. If you are interested in the language ones, we would have to send hard copies, but that is available.    MS. BREEN: I think we don't necessarily want copies of all the different languages now, but I think that if we were to do this in a cost effective way and in an efficient way, it really makes sense to start sharing these questionnaires and make people aware throughout the country that these questionnaires are available, they are available in various languages.    You, for example, might be interested in -- I don't know if these communities overlap with the communities in Orange County that you were talking about or any of the health clinics that you were talking about, but that kind of sharing and interchange would seem like it would be very rich and important and might help solve some of the data paucity problems that we have been hearing about so consistently in these populations.    MS. TRAN: We would be more than happy to share and we are actually working with the South Asian Network, and they have developed a survey as well, in five of the languages that they have referred to, to gather data in their communities.    So, collaboration amongst the small groups, you know, builds the number doing the good work that is going on in the communities.    MS. BREEN: I am glad to hear you are way ahead of the game.    MS. KAGAWA-SINGER: One of the things, just to add, so it is part of the record on the translation issue, it would be very easy just to sit down with bilingual folks and translate it.    What we also have is the interpretation, to make sure it is appropriate, to make sure it is worded in a way that is respectful.    The other is, then, we had to make sure that we had comparability amongst the seven different groups.    For example, some of the words didn't exist in a particular language. So, then they would translate it into something that was close but, since that word doesn't exist, then it would have to do.    Then they have to check with the other six to make sure that their translation, when it is back translated, actually has a similar enough meaning that the question is going to be equivalent.    MS. BREEN: Actually, that leads right into my next question, which was the process that you had for translating the same survey, or a comparable survey, into all these different languages.    You had recommended use of community groups with language capacity for more sophisticated sampling procedures in high concentration areas.    I think you also referred to translation as well, as part of that. Anyway, could we hear more about how you did the translation? Ninez has talked about the translation process with the CHIS, for example.    MS. KAGAWA-SINGER: Probably quite similar to Ninez' because I worked on that committee as well, but the process often doesn't get into the cost and the time line for most studies. So, they end up truncated considerably.    When it is done correctly, just to do it in one language, the Seattle ANCART group did it in Cambodian, and it took them eight months, with a team of six, working full time.    MS. BREEN: Is it more cost effective to do it simultaneously, to do multiple languages simultaneously?    MS. KAGAWA-SINGER: More cost effective? Well, in a way, because you want to make sure that everybody is talking to each other, and there are two other individuals here from the Chamorro group, who participated in that as well.    I think it helps to hear everybody else's reactions to the questions. Whether it is cost effective, that I can't answer. I know it is effective. I don't know about the cost part.    MS. BREEN: I was just thinking that otherwise you would have to do it again and start at the beginning again, and start at the beginning again. This way, there would be an interchange right up front.    MS. KAGAWA-SINGER: I think the interchange is extremely helpful. Just like a focus group, it produces different interactions than a one-to-one interview will, the same in the translation process.    We know, for example, in doing it in Spanish as well, even though there is only one language, there are so many different dialects, and some words in one would be the appropriate one, and it turns out to be quite insulting in another one, the same word.    That is the process I think we have to do in any of the languages, to make sure that the interpretation is correct.    MS. MAYS: Let me just check and see if there are questions -- if there are questions in the audience, please come to the mike, because we have one more presenter that we want to make sure that we have in.    MS. THEA: My name is Jo Thea(?), again, and I am from the South Asia Network. I was wondering if the scale that you have to measure acculturation assesses for socioeconomic status, gender as well as sexual orientation?    MS. KAGAWA-SINGER: Yes, that is where I was saying that what would precede this is the usual demographic questions that we would ask.    MS. THEA: And you do also assess for sexual orientation?    MS. KAGAWA-SINGER: Yes, and you mentioned income on there. One of the things that we have tried to institute on ours is not income.    These are new immigrant populations and many of them, the income is going to be very misleading, because they send so much home, so much money home, that you need to ask more like, do you have enough money to pay for health care at the end of the month, or something like that, something that has more to do with a wealth indicator than income.    For many of these people, it is a downward mobility in coming to the United States. There is one gentleman that I met who works with the health department in San Jose.    He was a French literature professor in Vietnam, and actually now he is working on an assembly line in Silicon Valley. So, those are the kinds of disjointed information you get on a survey, unless you knew the community well enough to understand why that would be a correct answer.    MS. MAYS: Other questions in the audience? Okay. I will let you do the last one. You have something you wanted to say.    MS. BREEN: Well, I did. If this is off the wall, you can just tell me. I was reading something from the UCLA Center for Health Policy on food insecurity.    I was wondering if those questions are useful in these populations? I think you might be familiar with them. There is a battery of questions that USDA has come up with which are on the California health interview survey and are increasingly used, to see whether people go hungry.    It is just asked of people who are maybe within 250 percent of poverty, similar to the population that you are talking about, who are eligible for screening under the CDC program. Are those questions of use here in terms of getting at SES status?    MS. KAGAWA-SINGER: I will ask the community folks. They are much closer to it.    MS. GUENTHER: Ny name is Mae and I am with the Guam(?) Communication Network, just recently came on. So, I have been getting quite an education lately. In regard to your question as to food insecurities --    MS. BREEN: Yes, measurement of food insecurities with these questions.    MS. GUENTHER: In our community, and I have found since I have come to work with Guam Communication and we have other partners, in our community, our people won't necessarily answer that question, because they feel it is an invasion of their privacy. They don't necessarily -- pride has a lot to do with it.    I went to a seminar yesterday and somebody brought up something about Samoans and homeless. This was a person who works apparently with this community thing, but there was a Samoan next to her, who didn't cut her off. She gave her a chance to have her say, but she came on and made the point that in the Samoan community, in the Tongan and in the Chamorro community, and in a lot of the other communities, we don't have homeless people.    If someone needs a place to stay, we take them in. So, in regard to -- that is like I was saying with food. We also try to make sure we feed -- our community is our family.     So, depending on the kind of question you were asking, a lot of people feel that that is not something that they want to disclose because, again, if I was asking the question, sure, they would let me know because they know me, but if someone like you just came over and asked that, they would not answer that.    MS. BREEN: That confirms other things we have heard.    MS. KAGAWA-SINGER: One of the other items, I think especially for the Pacific Islander groups, is that there are often, for several of the populations, there are more of that population here on the mainland than there are back on the islands, and there is a lot of back and forth going as well.      That is one of the things I don't know if they have spoken about mortality data and some of the problems that we have, the salmon effect. Has that come up?    MR. HITCHCOCK: Yes, I know what you mean. I don't think it came up.    MR. LENGERICH: I wasn't here yesterday. I would be delighted to hear.    MS. KAGAWA-SINGER: It is just that our mortality data, for two reasons, may look low. One is that there are those elders who, when they get old enough or sick enough, they will go home to die. So, they don't show up in our mortality statistics here.    The other is one thing that I do want to say, is the error rate. Robert Han at CDC has done some studies looking at the accuracy of ethnic indicators.    For Asian American Pacific Islanders, there is like a 37 percent error rate between what the person says and what gets recorded.    In California, we know, for Native Americans, it is more like 80 percent, at least in the cancer registry, an error rate. So, that is one of the other issues that we have to deal with on the recordings.    Obviously, for mortality, it is often the funeral home director, and they don't really ask that carefully.    MS. BREEN: Thank you. Thank you very much.    MS. MAYS: Okay, let me thank you. Obviously, your presentation not only gave us information but, again, like the previous one, sparked a lot of discussion that is very useful.     Thank you for your patience with the committee in the sense that we are wanting to get it right in terms of our recommendations. That is why there are a lot of questions.    Okay, one thing that is also important for us to consider is the issue of policy. Our policy colleagues are quite often involved in advocating and pushing policies that surround issues of data collection on race and ethnicity.     We are very fortunate today to have Ignatius Bau with us. Some of you will know him from his work at the Forum before, and if you have been on the Forum's list serv, part of what you know is that he is on top of a lot of issues.    He is now with the California Endowment, which we are very happy to have him there, but I am happy to have him at the hearing. It is a real special treat in terms of, again, for us to be able to talk about the policy issues.      A lot of times, as soon as we talk about data collection, everybody is like, well the researchers are the only ones at the table.    I am a big believer that, you know, it is like we can do articles until we are blue in the face. We are not the ones that then go out and try to make a difference with them, except at conferences.    I wanted to make sure that we have people who have real strong policy backgrounds here. I appreciate, because I know you were in D.C. I appreciate that you were able to, before you have to go home, to actually come and spend some time with us. So, thank you very much and welcome.     Agenda Item: Presentation by Ignatius Bau.    MR. BAU: Thank you for the invitation. I am now a program officer at the California Endowment, and I just want to briefly say a few words.    The endowment is a private statewide foundation that is committed to expanding access to affordable quality health care for underserved individuals and communities, and to promote fundamental improvements in the health status of Californians.    The approach that we take is that of a multi-cultural approach that wants to make sure that individuals are served and communities are served, regardless of financial status, racial origin, cultural beliefs, gender, age, sexual orientation, geographic location, immigration status and physical and mental abilities.    Obviously, the kinds of issues that this subcommittee and committee is addressing in terms of Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander populations are ones that are very, very critical and important in the work that we do.    As Dr. Mays mentioned, prior to my being at the endowment, I worked at the Asian and Pacific Islander American Health Forum.    At the health forum, we were part of successful community advocacy to create a White House initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in 1999.    I was honored to be asked by the President's Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, which was created by that initiative, to be the lead author of their first report, which was released in January 2001, and I will talk a little bit about some of the findings from that report in my testimony.    Just to give you a little more background about myself as well, I have also served on the President's Advisory Council on HIV and AIDS, and on numerous advisory bodies for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. So, I am very familiar with some of the issues that I will be trying to highlight in my testimony.    Closer to home here in California, I have also had the privilege of serving on the Department of Health Services' task force on multicultural health, as well as on several technical advisory committees for the California Health Interview Survey.    So, let me return to the President's Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. One of the things that they found was, they looked at the compliance with the 1997 Office of Management and Budget standards for the classification of race and ethnicity in federal data.    What they found was that, as of fall of the year 2000, only 12 of 32 federal departments and agencies actually collected aggregated or disaggregated data on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.    So, only 12 of 32 federal departments or agencies routinely collected data on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. Obviously, the Department of Health and Human Services is one of those departments.     Perhaps more disturbing is that, as of fall 2000, only 18 of the 32 departments and agencies -- this is across the federal government -- had actually implemented those 1997 standards and had a process in place.     While I don't have more updated information on that, the current White House initiative staff has actually collected more recent inventories and information from the 32 departments and agencies, but has not released that information yet to the public.    I would hazard to guess that those departments or agencies have not all come into compliance at this point. I think, as I will highlight later on in my testimony, I think even parts of the department of health and human services are having challenges reaching compliance as well.    However, even if we reached full compliance with the 1997 OMB standards, I believe that it would still be inadequate to meet the needs, and the health data needs in particular, of Asian American and Pacific Islander populations.      The President's Advisory Commission concluded that the specific needs of particular Asian American and Pacific Islander subgroups are even obscured with aggregation, and that the 1997 OMB standards should be strengthened to require additional disaggregation.    Right now, there are no uniform or comprehensive federal laws, regulations or policies that require that kind of disaggregation of Asian and Pacific Islander data.    However, I would suggest that one starting point that we could look to is the Healthy People 2010 initiative. What Healthy People 2010 did was, for the first time, followed the 1997 OMB standards, and disaggregates the available data for each of its 467 objectives by a separate Asian category that is distinct from a Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander category.    Moreover, what Healthy People 2010 does is, for each of those objectives, when data is not available, it specifies whether the data is either not collected, number one, or, number two, has been collected but has simply not been analyzed or, number three, has been collected and analyzed, but is not statistically reliable because it hasn't reached statistical significance or statistical power.    I believe that this actually presents a great template to look at the data needs and, obviously, to focus on where we might close some of the data gaps most easily.    Obviously, the places where data simply needs to be analyzed, where it is already collected, would be a good starting point, and certainly where data has been collected and has been analyzed, but is not statistically significant or reliable, may be good points to look at some of the sampling issues of aggregating multiple years of data, or using other sampling and analytical techniques to try to reach statistical significance.    I also think we have some examples in existing federal data sets that can also be good templates in how we can close some of these data gaps.     For example, the National Center for Health Statistics has routinely collected disaggregated data on Chinese, Filipino, Asian Indian, Japanese and Vietnamese populations.    However, the last time that they actually looked at that data by those disaggregated populations was in 1998, looking at 1992 to 1994 data.    Since that time, they have not had any systematic analysis of the disaggregated data that they already have in their current data sets.     Similarly, if you look at birth and death data, in 1984, there was the first study looking at Asian births, looking at disaggregated data among Chinese, Japanese, Hawaiian, Filipino and then a general other Asian and Pacific Islander category.    That was followed up by a more recent study in 1995, which looked at 1992 data, on those groups, plus additional other groups of Koreans, Samoans, Guamanians.    Again, since those two reports which were published in Monthly Vital Statistics, there has been no further analysis of the birth data that is available currently.    Similarly, in terms of death certificate data and mortality data, there was a report and analysis looking at 1992 mortality data, but there has been no effort since then to look at that data set.    Again, I think the fact that these prior studies and analyses have been done would obviously reinforce what you have heard throughout these days of testimony, that when you look at those disaggregated populations that oftentimes it is the Southeast Asian populations and Pacific Islander populations that have much more serious and worse health status that is often masked when you aggregate them with other populations like Japanese or Chinese populations.    Again, those would be good starting points, to use existing data sets. Oftentimes, the issue obviously resource allocation and prioritization of what kind of analysis gets done with those existing data sets.    Here in California we have similar challenges. The last time the California Department of Health Services published any major report or did any analysis of disaggregated data for Asian and Pacific Islander populations was in 1994 using 1990 vital statistics and census data.    Once again, here in California, what that report showed was that, for Southeast Asian and Pacific Islander groups, the first time they were sort of pulled out from the broader aggregated groups, they had much higher death rates and much more serious health issues than what might have been masked, again, by simply looking at the data in an aggregated manner.    Again, that hasn't been repeated with existing data that is available readily here in California since 1994 and, again, using 1990 data.    Fortunately, parts of the California Department of Health Services has been more responsive, and I wanted to highlight some of the work that the Office of AIDS here in California has done to consistently make disaggregated data by Asian and Pacific Islander populations available. It is collected routinely from local jurisdictions and then aggregated at the state level and reported out.    Unfortunately, though, what happens here is a disconnect between the state and the Centers for Disease Control. When that data is transmitted, usually electronically, to the Centers for Disease Control, CDC collapses all the data and loses all the subpopulation characteristics.     It is only now, I think, with an instruction that came out from the CDC in December of last year, in their rush to comply with the January 1, 2003 deadline for compliance with the OMB standards, that they are finally looking at ways in which they are going to change the Centers for Disease Control surveillance software to actually capture more detail and population specific data that has already routinely been collected here in the state of California and in other states like Hawaii, that had always been lost when they were transmitted to the federal government.    I also wanted to talk beyond morbidity and mortality data. You may or may not heard prior testimony about the importance of disaggregated data for other kinds of health policy planning and health services planning, specifically, when we are looking at participation, for example, in public health insurance programs.    A lot of the work that has been done down the street here by the UCLA center for research on health policy, has highlighted that when you disaggregate health insurance numbers, for example, for Asian and Pacific Islander populations, you can suddenly discover, for example, that Korean Americans have one of the highest rates of uninsurance among all racial and ethnic populations.    That, again, is masked if you only look at the aggregated insurance coverage rates for Asians and Pacific Islanders together.    Similarly, when you look at statistics -- again, we are going to be getting more and more of this kind of data from the California Health Interview Survey, of who has usual sources of care, who has not had regular doctor visits, who has had delays in treatment.    Again, when you look at the aggregated numbers, they don't look so bad, but when you disaggregate, again, Korean populations, other populations of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, you begin to see those differences emerge.    In the area of health work force, which is another use of, I think, this kind of data, we often look at, for example, physician population ratios.    Repeatedly, we are told that Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, as a whole, are over-represented and shouldn't be considered minorities.    Certainly, the American Association of Medical Colleges does not consider Asian Americans or Pacific Islanders to be under-represented minorities and not included in their outreach programs to minority populations. Native Hawaiians are considered under-represented minorities.    Some analysis that my former colleagues at the Asian American and Pacific Islander health forum did of 1990 data in California and in certain other selected states, again, showed what we might intuit, which is, while there were significant proportions of Japanese, Chinese, Filipino and Asian Indians serving their populations, there really was a dearth of Southeast Asian physicians, Pacific Islander physicians here in this state and nationally.    Again, I think that kind of analysis needs to be repeated, given census 2000 data that will be coming out later on this summer, and really demonstrating not what the figures in terms of physician to population or nurse to population or any other health profession to population ratio might be for Pacific Islanders as a whole, but for those particular populations.    Finally, I know I was asked to address the upcoming initiative here in California, right now slated for the March 2004 ballot.    The initiative would prohibit the collection and use of any data regarding race, ethnicity, color or national origin by any state or local government agency, including public universities and colleges, like UCLA.    There are exemptions in the initiative for law enforcement purposes, as well as to comply with any federal laws, or to establish or maintain eligibility for federal programs or funding, as well as an exemption for medical research subjects and patients.    A field poll that was just released last month of likely voters here in California showed that voters favored the initiative 48 percent to 33 percent, with 19 percent undecided.    Those numbers were essentially unchanged from an earlier field poll conducted a year earlier in April 2000. The one interesting and important variable, though, is that only 11 percent of likely voters in April 2003 actually knew about the initiative, or were familiar with the initiative, prior to being polled about what their position might be.    Many health and other organizations have taken positions against the initiative, including the California Medical Association, the American Public Health Association, and the California Conference of Local Health Officers.    Most recently, the University of California Board of Regents also took a public position opposing the initiative.    In its resolution opposing the initiative, the California Medical Association had this to say. Data on race, ethnicity and national origin is necessary for tracking and preventing disease, planning for necessary services, and distribution of scarce resources.    Data on race help health officials tailor immunization screening, prenatal and other prevention services for areas in greatest need.    Without necessary data, research on the distribution and cause of disease will be negatively impacted. Without critical information on race and national origin, health planners and researchers will not be able to understand and eliminate differences in health among racial groups.    Having less information will result in health and prevention programs which are more costly and less effective.    Again, this is from the California Medical Association resolution opposing the initiative.    I believe that we need to continue to do some very careful both legal analysis and programmatic analysis, especially around the exemptions for this committee, and for all the federal programs and funding streams that might be impacted if the initiative passes.    Obviously, the implications for health research, health programs, health planning and health services are enormous if the initiative passes here in this state.    Let me say one final note, and I know that you have probably had other individuals talk about this issue. As we look at where we need to go in the future in terms of the Office of Management and Budget standards, not only the need for further disaggregation by specific populations, but also the difficult challenges posed by the multi-race response, as has probably been highlighted, especially for Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders here in this state, the number of persons who identified themselves as Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders are only 35 percent of those who identified themselves as either single race or multiple race Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander.    Put another way, if you only looked at the single race responses in any particular data, you would be missing potentially 65 percent of folks who might identify as Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander.    As difficult as the bridging issues are going to be, and as difficult as the methodology issues are going to be, and the analytical issues, I would certainly urge that we look at tackling those issues with the best of our thinking and our analytical and statistical power that we have, because there is very complex and rich data to be mined by those multiple responses.     Again, I believe it is not accurate to only look at the single race data. We need to be clear, whenever we are looking at data from here on out, from the census in 2000, whether or not people are giving us the single race responses, or whether they are giving us the multiple race responses, and even to give us the range between the single race and the upper bounds of the multiple race responses.    If health analysis, health data analysis and any resulting health planning and policies are to be truly responsive to the heterogeneity of the health status and the health needs of Asian American and Pacific Islander populations, then I believe some of the laws, regulations and policies that I have touched upon could be further changed and adapted and strengthened, could ensure the collection, analysis and reporting of disaggregated health data that benefits and truly meets the needs of these diverse populations. Thank you.    MS. MAYS: Thank you very much for a very good presentation. I will start with my colleagues. Questions?    MR. LENGERICH: Just a clarification. Back at the beginning you said that 18 out of the 32 departments or agencies were not collecting data on Asian Pacific Islanders; is that correct?    MR. BAU: It was that 18 of the 32 had not, as of fall of 2000, had not implemented the 1997 OMB guidance. Twelve of the 32, so whatever the math is, 20 departments actually did not collect any programmatic data on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.    MS. MAYS: I had a follow up to that. Did you indicate that some of those are in HHS?    MR. BAU: No, obviously HHS is one of the 32 departments and agencies that does routinely collect lots and lots of data on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. These included other departments. I don't specifically have a list of which they are.    MS. MAYS: Then let me ask it a different way. In terms of looking at HHS, is it your sense, from the work that was done in that report, that HHS is in compliance?    MR. BAU: Again, I think given the example that I gave regarding HIV and AIDS surveillance data, I think HHS is trying to come into compliance, but it is going through every single surveillance system, every single data collection system, every single survey, and I think -- I don't have the most recent information. Hopefully some of that information is contained in the inventory that is from HHS sitting at the White House initiative.    I think that there are going to be significant challenges in trying to reach compliance on every single data set.    MR. HITCHCOCK: January 2003, I guess, was the compliance date. I think most surveys that have gone out of the field and went back in compliant. I think we have probably some multi-year studies that may still be out there that may need to be brought into compliance when they go into the field again.    MR. BAU: Yes, and then I think the confluence of the fact that the census 2000 happened, that the kind of bridging challenges actually made it a lot more complicated for a lot of agencies to come into compliance because then they realize that they can have a stable denominator to be working with as well.    MS. MAYS: Let me follow up on something. Dr.Kagawa-Singer kind of brought it up a little bit, and you really have, I think, also now put it on our radar screen, and that is about the work force, and this whole issue of who is qualifying and not qualifying, I guess, for some of the programs.    Can you tell me if there are any -- that you know of, any further activities going on to explore this any further?    Can you tell me if there is any recommendation? I thought it was different than what I am hearing today. I am realizing that the ones that I am somewhat aware of must be sometimes the exception to the rules.    I know in psychology there was a big fight that took place to make sure that, in the training of psychologists -- they actually had to go and present data and all this other stuff.    I think in that tiny instance, that grew to be my universe, but obviously this must not be the case. I think it is important for the committee to have a sense of this and to get a sense of what kind of recommendations to make.    That is where we need to disaggregate, that it doesn't just say Asian Americans, but that we try to get in these training programs groups that don't have numbers in the work force. Could you discuss that a bit more?    MR. BAU: Sure. Let me start with a lot of minority, either training programs, educational programs, fellowship programs that then branch out and move on into minority research stipends and supplements, all the way to minority faculty, fellowship programs and other support for junior faculty all the way through senior faculty.    In all of those programs, sometimes the definition of who is a minority who is eligible is in the statute. Sometimes it is in practice. Sometimes nobody knows where the definition came from.    So, there is no single statute, definition, across the federal government or across the Department of Health and Human Services, for that matter, or across the National Institute of Health, for example, that is consistently applied.    So, part of, I think, unraveling this question is, should there be a uniform definition. The approach that the American Association of Medical Colleges is now considering is revising their definition of who an underrepresented minority is rather than just saying underrepresented minorities, which I think has both strengths and weaknesses.    One, it opens it up to groups to make the case with data, assuming that the data is available. So, you are, somewhat, in a catch 22 that, if the data were available, then it would be much easier to make the case to the AAMC that Pacific Islanders and Southeast Asians, for example, are under-represented, whereas we might not be able to make the case that Asian Indian physicians or Chinese American physicians are under-represented.     The down side of that is, that you then have to make the case in every instance. Are you going to have to make the case with every single medical school? Are you going to have to make the case with every single association that considers that question?    I think somewhere between imposing a single uniform definition across the board, as well as having the flexibility, again, to make the case because, again, given the change in demographics, certainly not a static issues.     Populations will become much more prevalent here in the United States and, as they emerge and as their needs emerge, we need to have that kind of flexibility as well, as well as recognizing the historically under-represented populations, especially the African American populations, as well.    I think there are difficult policy questions, but certainly starting from good data of where the sources of authority and definitions for a variety of programs and whether or not some of them at least should come into greater alignment, I think, would be a good starting point.    Then, to follow this discussion that currently AAMC is particularly having around medical school enrollment, which is obviously focused on physicians, and where that discussion goes, I think, is a fruitful conversation.    Obviously, the other political overlay on all of this is what happens with the Supreme Court decision in the University of Michigan affirmative action case, in which case race and ethnicity may or may not be more explicit of a factor in terms of admission policies, as well as the administration of many of these kinds of programs, even by HHS.    MS. MAYS: Do you know if this is on the agenda, for example, of the President's group?    MR. BAU: It is very much on the agenda. I am glad to say one of the meetings I was in, in Washington, D.C. last week, was a meeting of the Federation of the Associations of the Schools of the Health Professions, which is not only the AAMC, but the nursing schools, the pharmacy schools, the physician assistant schools.    They are very much interested in watching what happens with the Supreme Court case, as well as continuing their collective commitment to a diverse work force, and strategies of potentially collaborating more with each other on how to support a diverse work force.    MS. MAYS: Okay, thank you very much. Now we ask the audience. We open this up. Everybody is a participant. Other questions, comments from those i the audience?    MS. KAGAWA-SINGER: I wondered if you had any further information on other organizations that are discussing the initiative coming up, and what the ramifications would be?    That may be data on housing, on bank loans, on many other kinds of data bases that we, in health, are interested in, in looking at contextual issues for particular populations. So, how might that be addressed?    MR. BAU: As of now, I think there are beginning to be, for example, local governments that are looking at what their public position is going to be on the initiative, and I think certainly in each of the sectors, whether it is school districts and education institutions, or those interested in education or, as you mentioned, in housing, and community and economic development, those sectors are all looking at the initiative and its implications.    I think sometimes the connection, especially regarding the exemptions, are less clear because of the mix of federal and state funding for a lot of those programs, whereas a lot of the health programs are driven by HHS priorities and HHS programs.    Even though they come through the state, they are often, if you look behind them, are coming from the federal government.    So, I think other sectors are engaging in the issue and obviously March 2004 still seems a long time away for a lot of folks.    MS. MAYS: Any other questions or comments? Please, come to the mike.    MR. CHOW: Danny Chow(?) with the Asian Pacific American Legal Center. I have a related question about the medical exemption.    It is not really defined in the initiative, and I was wondering if there was any kind of assessment as to what exactly that means.    Some people are taking it to mean we are talking about the more formal medical research with experimental designs. Proponents of the initiative would say, this is something that applies across the board.    I am just wondering what the status is in terms of interpretation of that particular exemption.    MR. BAU: I think different people will have different interpretations and will continue to do so, and that that is not going to be resolved, unless the initiative actually passes, and then it will be subject to legal challenge, to try to test what the extent of the scope of those kinds of exceptions might be.     MS. MAYS: Do we have any other questions or comments? Okay, thank you very much. Your presentation has been very insightful.    I think that it has put something on our agenda that we have not actually thought about. So, we are very appreciative of that.    I want to say thank you very much for taking the time. We want applause for everybody. So, let us thank all of our speakers this morning for a wonderful morning that we have had.     Okay, let me just make a comment,how to tell you to get to lunch. Unfortunately, because we are really having a committee meeting, we can't feed you because, as you know, as a person of color, I would not have people coming and not feeding you.    So, we all know how to act right in terms of our culture, but this is one of those federal things where I can't feed you and we can't feed you.    I can tell you, on behalf of UCLA, where you can get food, which is right across the way in what is known as Kirkoff. It is our eating facility. Ackerman Union is kind of the name. [Luncheon discussed.] We will reconvene at 1:30.    [Whereupon, at 12:26 p.m., the meeting was recessed, to reconvene at 1:30 p.m., that same day.]     A F T E R N O O N S E S S I O N  (1:37 p.m.)    MS. MAYS: We are going to reconvene again this afternoon. I want to welcome those of you who are just joining us. What I would like to do is to be able to introduce those who are just joining us.    MS. POUESI: Jane Pouesi.    MS. MAYS: Could you say where you are from, just so everybody knows?    MS. POUESI: I am with the Office of Solomon Affairs.    MS. LUCE: Pat Luce. I am with the Pacific Island Council of Leaders.    MR. KERMOTO: I am Ford Kermoto(?) and I wear several hats. One of the hats is the National Asian and Pacific American Families Against Substance Abuse, and another hat is with Magna System.    MS. KERMOTO: Frances Kermoto with Magna Systems.    MR. DAVIS: Good afternoon, everybody. I am Brad Davis, your audio visual tech for UCLA.    MS. MAYS: Okay, today has been a day in which, for those of you who are just joining us and those of you who have been here earlier, as you know, today has been a day when we have tried to spend some time looking at those populations in particular that don't have data.     I mean, for some populations, we sit and try to talk about, in terms of the huge samples, sampling and what the issues are.    Today, part of what we have heard is more about the fact of not having data, and what not having data leads to in terms of difficulties with ensuring a healthy population.    So, it is within that context that we welcome our next group of individuals who are going to be speaking with us.    Some of them you have heard from this morning. I feel like we have kind of started already, which is good. Mae Cruz Guenther is a nurse, and she has recently begun working with the Guam Communications Network. She is going to talk a bit about experiences for the Chamorro.    June Cruz Milligan, who is also with Mae, is going to also be talking about some of these issues.    We are also expecting a couple of other people. So, as they come in, don't be surprised if they just join you at the table.     So, first, on behalf of -- I get to do this because we are here -- on behalf of UCLA, I welcome you and then secondly, on behalf of the Subcommittee on Populations of the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics, we are very pleased that you have taken your time to be with us today. So, welcome, and whoever wants to start.     Agenda Item: Remarks by Mae Cruz Guenther.        MS. GUENTHER: I will give you a little history on Guam and the people from Guam. It will kind of help you understand a little bit more why we are at the point of where we are, and why there is little or no data in regard to our specific needs, in regard to health and insurance.    Guam is located in the Pacific Islands. It is part of Micronesia -- no, wait a minute, Marinas Islands.    Guam is the largest island. It is a U.S. trust territory. The other three islands are Saipan, Tinian and Rhoda, which are commonwealths.    MS. MAYS: Can we ask you, because I think it would actually be helpful for us, can you tell us what it means to be a commonwealth and to be a U.S. trust island?    MS. GUENTHER: I have no idea.    MS. MAYS: We will ask that also of everyone.     MS. GUENTHER: I just know that, because Guam was a strategic military installation during the war, that is how we came about to become a U.S. trust territory. The people after the war were naturalized citizens, to that point.      Anyway, the original Chamorros were known as Totomonas. Then the Spanish came and took over and intermarried, and the Spanish and the local island language was combined.    Then the Americans came and took over Guam. Then we had Spanish, Chamorro, and then we learned English. Then we had the advent of World War II, where we were overtaken by the Japanese and Japanese was added to our language skills, and Chamorro was submersed and English wasn't spoken. It was Japanese.    Then the Americans came back and took us over again and, once again, English became the language. There was a law passed that we were not allowed to speak Chamorro, and that law is still on the books, as far as I know. It has never been taken off, but we speak Chamorro. We don't teach it in the school system.    The majority of the Chamorros, at that time, joined the service. At that time, they were not citizens. So, the Filipinos and the Chamorros that joined the service were only allowed to become either bosun's mates or stewards.    After the war, then they became naturalized citizens. So, the concentration of Chamorros in California is the largest all over.    After the last 2000 census, it was noted that there was a Chamorro in every state in the union. I think there was one in New Hampshire, but we had a Chamorro in every state of the union.    Considering our population, we had the highest concentration in California, and in San Diego County, there are over 10,000 Chamorros.     Now, you wonder how come there has never been any data? Well, we have been assimilated. Our people, even though they maintain their traditions, we have assimilated into the American culture, almost too well.    I guess the thing -- I can use my history. We will go for that. That is a lot easier for me. Being raised -- both my parents are Chamorro, so I am Chamorro. Because my dad was in the service, and his station was in the United States, they did not want it to be a barrier for us.     They felt at that time, if we were to try to learn Chamorro and English, that it would slow us down and cause problems for us, to fit into the system.      So, we were raised speaking English, even though our parents, we still did a lot of Chamorro traditions. Up until I got older, until I got married, I never really questioned that I was on my own little Chamorro way, because I had no problems going to school. I fit in with everybody and I didn't think there were any problems.    When, however, the census came about, when I became aware of the census, it struck me as funny because I always had to put down other.    For years I was other, until the last few years, they added Pacific Islander, and I thought, oh, okay, they are getting close.    Then the last couple of years they actually put in Guamanian or Chamorro. I thought, dang, I finally made it.    My husband, who is Hali(?), he is the one who, when the census was coming out, he said, honey -- because we have three children -- he said, honey, you put down the kids as Chamorro.    He said, there are lots of us white guys around. He says, but you Chamorros aren't going to be counted if you don't put it down and the only way you guys are going to get noticed is if you put down on the census that you are chamorro.    At that time, they didn't give you choices to put down whether you were half and half. So, my family, under Guenther, was Chamorro.    Still, I didn't really think there was a problem until I went to nursing school. I was the only Chamorro student, of Chamorro descent.    My dad, who had been diabetic for years, but I never really questioned any problem with his diabetes -- because, in the navy, when he came in, he was a chief steward. He was a cook.    He knew about food. So, he could take his knowledge of the food and convert it. Even though he was able to eat his own foods, he knew how to portion, he knew what he needed to do.    When I was diagnosed with diabetes, I went to the diabetes class and I thought, this is really neat and this is really interesting, but they don't have my food down here.    They are not addressing -- they weren't addressing my needs. I had to try to kind of figure it out and I later realized that I went the way that most Chamorros do, yeah, yeah, yeah, that is fine, and did whatever it is that I thought I was going to do anyway.    So, I had a really hard time. Then, working as an RN, I worked at night. There is nothing written for diabetics who work nights, much less a diabetic who is a Chamorro who works nights.    Diabetics are supposed to sleep during the night and work during the day. Again, I thought, wow, isn't this interesting.     Again, I went on my merry little way, not really thinking of the impact until my data became really ill, and then I became really ill.    I think one of the reasons I became really ill was I had a hard time with my life style. I was living the American dream and still trying to be Chamorro, and it didn't work.    I was trying to be super mom. There is no such thing as super mom. You have systems break down.    Anyway, eventually for my diabetes, I developed heart problems. My dad, who has been going to his doctor, his doctor mentioned, you have bad genes. I thought, why does everybody tell us we have bad genes. They don't really know our genetic make up. We are Chamorros, but the genes don't really have anything to do with it. It is our life style.    We are just told, you need to make all these changes, and it is hard to tell someone to make changes and expect them to do it, when they don't really understand what changes they have to make.    Most of our people in the Chamorro culture, they all have insurance. They go to the doctors, but they don't let the doctors know that they have problems with anything.    They agree with the doctors. They take any medications the doctors give them, and then they go home and do whatever it is they figure is best for them.     We have never really had data. Nobody has ever come up and asked me, well, Mae, you are Chamorro. What do you think about how it impacts.    This is the first time that I have ever heard about data being collected for a population of minorities. The only time I was never considered a minority -- that was according to my father -- was when he was working at Cal State Long Beach.    My husband went to get a job and my husband couldn't get in because my dad said he was not a minority. He made the point that at Cal State Long Beach at that time, which is over 20-some years ago, my husband was a minority, because Cal State Long Beach mostly employed, in the custodial and all that, Chamorros. That was the one time weren't a minority.    Any other time we were invisible. We have assimilated into the American culture and we have just kind of tried to survive.    One of the scary things that I have noticed is diabetes and cardiovascular is rampant in our race. It wasn't that before, years before, but our life styles have caused all these problems that we have, and we have never -- there have never really been any programs to help us correct those.    There has never been any education or awareness made that we, as Chamorros, as Pacific Islanders, we need to take our life styles and change them.    It has never been explained in a way that we can understand, especially our older people, and it is carried down to our younger generations, in that they have been so well assimilated the problems that they have they have never really questioned.    I think you need to ask me some questions, because I am not sure I said everything I was supposed to.    MS. MAYS: There is one more thing you can talk about, the food pyramid, but we will let you and then I want to have you comment about the food pyramid again.    MS. MILLIGAN: I think getting back, and backing up what -- we are sisters, we both have the same middle name, Cruz -- you know, going back and following the issues that we have been, I guess, an invisible race.    We are just now, both of us have just -- we have been active within our community as far as our social, and coming together and trying to maintain, and it is just recently she has taken on an RN profession.    She noticed a lot more of the medical urgencies that our community needs. I was more on the social and I was helping in other ways, and it wasn't until I joined the Guam Communication Network and getting involved with the Reach 2010, and the PATH project, which deals with breast and cervical cancer, that I took a step up, in trying to bring more awareness to my community, to my fellow Chamorro people.    It was interesting because we are educated, we have got a lot of western influence with us. At the same time, there is a lot of culture, our Chamorro culture, that we do maintain.    We know where we are from and we know how to prepare different foods, and the social activity that we have together is very strong, but the health issues are not addressed, and we are not quite sure how to address it.     I have been working with trying to get the knowledge and working with the BCRP with the northern and southern parts of California, and trying to collect that data hasn't been done, I should say.    So, trying to do it within our community has been very difficult, because what is it for. Why do we need this stuff.     Yes, they do us the same way as the western medical thing, and it was very difficult to break up the social atmosphere that we have and then trying to become the educators or just bringing more awareness and outreach within our community.    Through the help of Reach 2010 and PATH, we have been trying to develop, and it is a slow process, but there is so much other areas that we need to address.    One of the parts that we would need to address is, we have a lot of Guam referral patients coming from Guam, and they are citizens.    The problem that we are having with them is that they are being air vacced from Guam because, first of all, they do not have the medical facility or the capability to help the people on the island.    Then they come over here to the States and their referred to, depending on the area and the illness, to Good Samaritan out here in Los Angeles, Anaheim Memorial out in Orange County, and Loma Linda. Those are just three of them. If you happen to be in the military, you can go down to Balboa, down toward your San Diego area.    The problem that we are having is that they are coming out here. These people have been, again, assimilated with the western, but trying to maintain their culture and blending in with the western, and we are colliding. Our culture, our eating habits, are colliding drastically.    We are having a lot of health issues and we don't know how to address them. No one knows about our community. Nobody knows about our group because there is no data.    Why is there no data? We have been either -- like my sister has been saying, it is either Asian or Pacific Islander, depending upon which one you feel like.    Well, let me see here, well, I think I will go Asian this time and then, the next time I will fill it out, I will put it down in Pacific Islander. If there is an other, then I can write it in, but who takes the time to read what that other is?    I don't think so. I don't think, unless it is printed out and everything is computer, you shove it in -- they don't take that time. It is like the Florida thing, that little thing. Nobody pays attention to it.    Nobody has paid attention to us, and we are here because we feel the importance. We are active within a lot of our communities, that we do have little pockets where there is community. There is social activity, and that is how we stay together with figuring out what is going on.    Back east, Hawaii, California, all over, wherever there are a little bit of Chamorros, we seek each other out. That is how we keep together, you know.    We try to -- if somebody is sick, then there is this hot line that goes out and we try to help each other. Sometimes we are not able to. Sometimes we don't have the facilities that we can.    For example, like our referral patients that are coming out here that have a lot of needs and they aren't able to be addressed.    We have people who are stranded out here, it seems like. They are medical referral patients. Just the breakdown between the medical referral doctors back in Guam and out here in the States has been so broken down that they are coming out here for -- being diagnosed back in Guam for one illness.    They are coming out here to the States and they have a second opinion and they don't have that problem. They have got a worse problem.    A prime example was a woman who came out here for, what was it -- the one we were talking about -- she was not diagnosed. She said that they didn't have cancer back in Guam.    She came here to the States, and she has cancer. . She has had cancer for a while and nobody realized it. Nobody noticed it. It did not show up back on Guam.    It is not like we are -- we are not -- we are part of the system. We just have no idea what part of the system we are.    I think a lot of trying to educate our people and trying to get the myths broken down, again, this is dealing with the cancer.    One of our Chamorro community members passed away and she had breast cancer. She had a lump. She was semi-aware of self breast exam, going through, but what she chose to do -- and this woman was semi-educated, but what happened was, she has insurance, but instead of going through the western medical doctors, she chose to go to our Sarana(?), which is our medicine doctors that treat with herbs and other ways of healings.    She kept going back and forth from Guam to visit her medicine doctors. Unfortunately, when it was diagnosed, she passed away two weeks later, because she chose to ignore the systems.    It is like that, and it was a coming together as a community and us outreaching and just saying, this is a sign. Something is wrong. Yes, some of our herbs work, but where is that fine line? We need more education. We need more awareness.    MS. MAYS: I am going to ask you to just give me the example about the food pyramid but, as we do that, I am going to ask Salla if she will actually come up and join us. So, as she gets your name tag and you join us at the table, she is going to tell us, there was a story about the food pyramid that I wanted her to share with people.    MS. GUENTHER: Yes, part of Guam Communications, they are a multi-service organization and it is all through grant funding.     They are actually the first organization that is Chamorro based that is actually trying to outreach to the people.    One of their programs is called HOPIS and the other one is called Cares. In HOPIS, the director is Dr.Eileen Moon, who is out of UCLA, and HOPIS is a program that is lasting -- we have got funding from the CDC and is lasting until 2007.    The first part of HOPIS is immunization and the second part is coming up, it is going to be diabetes, and the third cardiovascular.    In the diabetes phase, what our biggest problem was, was that, again, we have the food pyramid as presented by the American Diabetes Association, but we needed to modify it to fit each of the communities that is in HOPIS.    The Samoan Nurses Association has this food pyramid. They took this food pyramid and they converted it for the Samoan people. It is really neat, but they are the only ones that have it. The Filipinos don't have one, the Tongans don't have one, the Cambodians and Laotians, they don't have one.    Part of HOPIS is also they are doing surveys. This is the first time where I feel that they were actually trying to reach out and find out how many Chamorros, how many Tongans, how many Samoans are we reaching out in regard to awareness and education, in regard to immunization, diabetes and cardiovascular.    This is the first program that I have heard of where we are actually trying to get counted for something, but that is one of the barriers that we have, besides the fact that our people -- you have to be accepted by your people before you can conduct any of these things.    Because of my parents and the involvement I have had in my Chamorro community, and because I am a nurse, that goes a long way in acceptance for the people for me.    The fact that I don't speak the language is a barrier in my case, but I make sure that I take somebody with me who speaks the language. Then, again, we have that interpretation, the problem with interpretation.    Margie made some outstanding points, and a lot of our people, even though they speak the language, they don't necessarily read it and, in reading it, it is a matter of interpreting, what is that that is written, and what are we saying and how are they interpreting it.    In our immunization survey, in fact, we have one in language, in Chamorro, and we have one in English. I, of course, because I don't speak the language, I am using the one in English.    Well, I thought, oh, we have got somebody to help me who speaks Chamorro, Joe. Joe is reading the Chamorro version and he is going, this isn't right. This doesn't match the English.    So, now what he is doing in the survey is, he is taking the English version and reading it in Chamorro and people are going, oh, that is what you mean, but they have a lot of complaints, in that they feel, why are you asking all these questions. Why do you need to know this. What difference is it going to make to us, to me or to my family.    We really need more data in regard to not just Pacific Islanders, but each little specific group under there.    MS. MAYS: I thought that would be a nice welcome. I knew when she told the food pyramid story, that she was actually going to talk about it relative to the Samoan Nurses Association. So, I thought that would be a nice welcome to you, to the table.    Salla Mataalii is with the Samoan Nurses Associations. So, welcome, and please share with us your comments.     Agenda Item: Remarks by Salla Mataalii.      MS. MATAALII: I would like to ask June Pouesi if she can join us here, because she is very -- she has been a part of our community, and they have supported our community for quite some time. She is here, and I didn't think I was going to make it here, but I tried my best to be here. So, I ask June if she can join with us.    My name is Salla Mataalii. I am the chairman and the president of Samoan National Nurses Association. I just want to share a minute or two about our organization.    We have been around since 1996. We actually established the organization in 1996. We didn't really do anything until 1998, and from 1998 until now, we have been outreaching our community.    If I may share this story with you, how I started out, I have been here in California, lived in Southern California, for 29 years.    I have been educated here. I graduated from UCLA. I have been a nurse for 28, 29 years. It was very difficult to put together an organization.    As you know, in our Samoan community, we have very few organizations that are serving our community. One example is the Office of Samoan Affairs. They have been around for quite some time. So, we had some more federation. The only other is the Samoan Nurses Association.    When we started out, it was very difficult. My introduction to this whole thing was through one of the very good friends of mine who is from the Chamorro community, Lola Saplan Santos(?).    I remember when I first met her. She was telling me what she was doing for her community. I asked her, you know, I have been trying to do something for our community. I have helped a lot of our Samoan community through the hospitals, coming in as an interpreter, as someone who is helping them medically.    So, I started hanging around with her. I attended a conference with her. She helped pay some of my fares to go with her, and from there, I learned. I picked up a lot from her, from just attending conferences.    I started to organize this nurses association. I remember the first amount of money that we had was given to us as a subcontractor, through the Chamorro, the Guam Community Network, was $600.    We went to the community. I get very emotional when I share this story, because the $600 went a long way for me and my nurses.     We went to four different churches. We helped them show how to do breast self examination. We educated them about breast cancer. We are trying to get free mammography programs for them.    Through that, the $600, we found four women total with abnormal mammograms, and we were able to help them. Three of them survive today. One passed away. From then on, I started networking with other organizations.    Right now, we are a 501(c)(3) organization. It is a non-profit. We have worked with Margie Kagawa-Singer for the last three or four years.    We have outreached our community. We have gone out. We had a health fair that we provided free mammograms. We have had some programs to work together with the Office of Samoan Affairs, to outreach our community on cervical and breast cancers.    It has been a long way for us. I think what they have shared with you are very similar problems to the ones that we have in our community.    We have no data. Of course, our communities are very small in numbers. Therefore, it is very difficult for us to get funding.    For my organization alone, we have tried. For so many years, funding was given out as Asian Pacific Islanders. We finally have our own category, as Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders.    It is mandated by law that we must be recognized. I really feel that data should be collected on Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, so that something can be done for our community.    We share the same problems. The Chamorro, the Tongan, the Samoans, the Hawaiians. We have the same problem. We have no data to base anything.    The small data that we have, it is either very limited, the number of people who have this data. I just completed two years with the Little Company of Mary Hospital.    We were funded for a diabetes project. I was the RN manager. I worked with the only Samoan doctor in Southern California, and he is on the staff at Little Company of Mary.    We have outreached 33 churches from Orange County to the Valley to the South Bay area. We have collected data. They are working on those data. They should be coming out. Little Company of Mary and some of the people that worked with putting the data together with Dr. Mao(?).    It was very difficult to outreach the community. There is lack of awareness of diabetes in the community, and it is one of the predominant diseases affecting our community.    Nutrition, obesity, to weight problem to diabetes, to high blood pressure, high cholesterol, stroke, heart diseases, these are all diseases that, when I grew up in Samoa, even coming here for the first time, you hardly heard of these things affecting our community. Now, it is like one member of every family that I know is affected by high blood pressure or diabetes.    Through this program, we outreach our community. We have gone out to our community with health education classes.    I have taught with Dr. Mao the nutrition part of the program, the education about diabetes, how to maintain your blood pressure, how to maintain your blood sugar level. I mean, we have gone out to the communities and done this.    We have seen the tremendous changes in our community. Some of them never knew anything about diabetes, or were afraid to go to the doctor because they had no insurance.    This program was able to help us, to provide care, to provide treatment for some of them who have no insurance, and that is one of the biggest problems that we have, an uninsured population.    So many of them, they are afraid to see the doctor. They don't know what to say. They don't understand the language. They depend on their grandchildren and the children to take them to the hospital.    We don't have any materials that are translated in the Samoan language, let alone a lot of Pacific Islanders languages, to help our community.     These are the things that we are trying to help our community. Earlier I mentioned that we have been working with Dr. Margie Kagawa-Singer, and we have done -- I mean, I am so grateful.    I am very grateful for Dr. Solon Park(?) and Margie for their help with us in our fight to help our community of women on breast cancer and cervical cancer. June, let me ask you to step up here.    MS. POUESI: June Pouesi, American Samoan, and with the Office of Samoan Affairs. It just makes me very proud to see my Chamorro sisters here and Salla.     It was from the Chamorro group that we found out about this hearing. It was from Lola, and I want to thank Lola for that.    Again, I am going to reiterate what Salla has stated. There is a federal mandated category called NHOPI, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islanders.      Continuously, I am seeing AAPI. There is no such group at this point in time. We will be moving at the national level.     I would hope that this hearing here would allow for that message to come from below going up, where we will be coming from the top going down.     It is critical for us to have our own category for data, and the history of that is that, in 1995, when OMB opened up hearings to deal with the race categories, Pacific Islanders had gotten together from the national level and including also Hawaii.    I mean, including Salla Mataalii, Segundo Bingo(?) from the Chamorro group and some of the Hawaiian groups -- Page Barber, there were several of us had been involved in it.    The whole purpose that we have heard from our community is, we are invisible. We were invisible in the Asian Pacific Islander category.    We had moved to separate us, to allow us, basically for what you are doing here, data collection. Data collection.    Please do not go backwards on this. There is no issue about this AAPI. The federal government has made the decision. The question is, as of January 2003, the federal government was mandated to put that into place.    We have found that that has not taken place, and we are appalled by that. Even the fact that we are coming here, you have combined the group together, but it would have been nice if you had Asian one day, Pacific Islander one day, get the community out here and talk.    If that is what you want to know about us, let us talk. Let us tell you what is happening in the grass roots, and then teach us.    We work with our counterparts on the Asian side to learn about stats and so forth, if that is necessary. Like the group that Salla is talking about, they are beginning to learn. They are working, along with GMC, with SSG, that has provided good training for them.    You know, we can't do everything, but I am saying to you, give us the decency of being who we are, because I will tell you one thing. If you combined two of the other categories together, if it was the African American and the Asian together, no way we are going to allow this type of thing to go.     We have worked hard for this category. We want our own data and we want our own stats, and that is the message that I bring from the Pacific Islander community. Thank you.    MS. MAYS: What I would like to do at this point is, first of all, to say, for this committee, we are honored to have you here in terms of in order to receive your stories.    Our responsibility will be to try to be honorable in receiving those stories, to see what we can do with that. I do think we have an honorable committee. So, we will move ahead with that.    I would like to now open it up for questions from the panel, and then open it up to the audience. Questions here in terms of my colleagues?    MR. LENGERICH: Sure. I also want to express my thanks to you all for coming here to enlighten us, really. It is very enlightening for me. It is really helpful.    I want to pick up a little bit on the issue of Guam, and also a comment we heard earlier this morning and that is about the movement back and forth between California, the mainland, and Guam, then. How frequently does that happen for individuals?    You were talking about being diagnosed there and then coming over here for care.    MS. GUENTHER: That is just basically in reference to the Guam referrals. We have a large community who live here, who retired here, and the one thing -- June and I are representing actually Lola, and we are a very poor substitute for this woman who has done so much.    She is the reason I am here. She is amazing and she has been more like a one woman show who has really tried to get the Chamorro people together. I am just not as articulate.    MS. MAYS: I think everyone up here will tell you, you are doing fine, and we all acknowledge how much we are learning from you.    MS. GUENTHER: There is so much that is in my head that I can't get out. The Guam referrals that have been coming over, that is because in Guam the health system is almost nonexistent, and most of the -- from my understanding, there are over 100,000 people on the Island of Guam.    It is only 42 by 12 miles long but, of that 100,000 people, there is barely a third who are Chamorro. The majority of them have left, have gone off island.     Like I said, the highest concentration is here in California. My dad was transferred here in 1960. So, my family has been here since October of 1960, we have lived in California.    Salla was talking about how every family has at least one person that is diabetic. In our family of five, including my mom and dad, June and my mother are the only ones who don't have diabetes.    At this point in time, my other sister, my two brothers and my dad, who died eight years ago, we have diabetes.    Both of my parents had heart problem and had bypass surgery. I had a bypass surgery three years ago. I am diabetic. My two younger brothers have diabetes really bad.    The youngest boy, he had his first open heart surgery when he was 40. He had a five or six bypass. Diabetes, just within the community, within Los Angeles, Long Beach, San Diego area, it is like asking somebody if you have somebody in the service, diabetes and heart.    There is no data saying that. It is just that, by going out and just being in the community that this has all come up.    When I used to ask questions, you know, how come we are not -- how come nobody is taking care of this, why isn't this being addressed, am I the only one that sees that it is a problem, it is not so much that I am the only one but unfortunately, because of our assimilation into the American culture, most of our young people, when they become the doctor, the nurses, they are no longer Chamorro. So, they don't come back to the community to help with the awareness and the education.    Since meeting Lola, she has given me that passion, that I need to get out there and bring awareness to my people about my people's plight, about the Samoans, the Tongans.    When I first came to GCN, I was just supposed to be working with HOPIS. I love that group of people so much that, when they switched me to CARES -- well, they found out I was a nurse, so I also am resident nurse for GCN -- I went, okay, whatever -- but I just admire like the Samoan Nurses Association.    There are a lot of Chamorro nurses but can we make an association? No, not at this point in time.    MS. MATAALII: Believe me, it is not easy. It took me a year and a half, almost two years, just to call the nurses around.    Even when I put this organization together, there was a lot of saying, you are not getting nowhere. Like she said, to share the same problem, people have been here for long, there is very little that is done -- I am talking about medically, in the health field. Nothing has been done.    So, when they heard we were putting this together, it was very difficult just to make the people aware that we had an organization that we are coming out to help the community.    Back to when she is talking about diabetes, like I said earlier, it is the most predominant illness that is affecting our people.    It affects the heart, cholesterol, nutrition. You are not just tackling diabetes alone. You are going and teaching them about nutrition.    The young ones who are growing here in the United States, they love the fast food, but that is where we see a lot of our people are getting in trouble.     A lot of them are coming from back home which they didn't have the disease, and they are affected by diabetes over here.    With Dr. Mao, with the number of patients he has treated, this is the number one cause of death in his patient, are either stroke, heart disease or diabetes, so many of them are on dialysis.    They know so little about this is one of the causes of dialysis. You have diabetes, and they know so little about it.    So, you get people to try to put together and go out into the community, but making our community understand our concern and we are going out to help them, it is very, very difficult.    You know, we have so many other community organizations that are coming in, influx our community and say, we are here to serve your community.     It is very, very difficult for a non-Samoan to serve the community of Samoans. I am speaking for Samoans only.    Our people are very sensitive. If you don't trust them, they will not listen to you, they will not. It is very difficult to get them around.    So, if you have your own people to serve your own community, it is much easier, because people can understand the language, and they are comfortable with you.    MS. MAYS: Let me ask a question based on exactly what you are saying. One of the ways that some of the data is gotten is that somebody in another place will call a household.    When they call the household, they will talk to somebody in the household and they might ask you a few questions. Then, if you qualify, then they want to ask you a lot more questions.    So, the question I have is, for example, in your communities, if I called and I said, I am with the American Community Survey, and this is a survey designed to -- I have to make it up, I don't know all the words -- designed to find out a little bit about you and your family, would you participate?    MS. GUENTHER: No.    MS. MAYS: I have a follow up question, because I really wanted to ask you this. If I handed your kids a survey, what would your kids say they were?    Remember, you say your husband told you to count the kids, but this is just an issue of identify, to some extent, because you are talking about even in your own community, individuals who try to get them to work with you.     For some people, it is the assimilation. So, the other question is, we may be getting data -- I don't know this but I have to think about all the efforts that are going on, and I am really trying to figure it out.    If someone called some of the households that you know, what would people say they were?    MS. MATAALII: Our people get very suspicious, because there are so many surveys, there are so many -- different things are coming into the community and we are doing this, we are doing.    People are so afraid, there is so much suspicion, well, what is this for. When you call, you don't care who you talk to.     If you talk to somebody, a grandson or a granddaughter who understands English, yes, they may understand what you are saying, but telling it to the parents, to the uncles and aunts who hardly speak any English or don't understand English, they say, what are you talking about.    It takes trust for people to even, given all the information, like I said, they are so suspicious about giving our information.    With the census, we found this out with the census, because I know there are a lot of families that aren't counted for, a lot of them.    Sometimes they say, there are 13, 14, 15 people in one household. I know during the census time, we had the hardest time and I know they were helping with the census, too, going out to Samoan families.    Like I say, they always say, what is this, again, what is this for. It is making them understand the importance of what you are doing.    It is important for everybody to be accounted for, because this is the only way that they know how many Samoans are living here.    Again, we go back to going back and forth, the families, back and forth here. There is a lot of moving around in our community, staying with the uncles here, staying with the aunts here.    So, a lot of time they are either miscounting them at the census time. I know for a fact that a lot of families were not accounted for.    MS. GUENTHER: There is a big fear that even though it is supposedly anonymous and it is just a census, there is still the fear that, well, if I put this down, they are going to come back and get me, there is something going to happen.    MS. MAYS: What do they think will happen?    MS. GUENTHER: Chamorros are citizens, but for some reason they still have this fear that, if I put this information down, it is going to come back to bite me.    MS. MILLIGAN: I know, when we were trying to inform our community about the census coming up, after it was done, we worked really hard, okay, fill this out, make sure you fill out the census when the 2000 came out.    After the fact, we came back and we found out, just through casual conversation, that they filled out what they wanted to fill out on certain parts of it, and on certain parts of it -- like the income portion, why was that important?    Well, I didn't fill it out. Well, they were asking me this. I didn't fill that part out either. So, part of the data was collected, but it was incomplete. So, how much was that worth?    If the data is incomplete in one portion, does it hold weight for other portions as well?    MS. MATAALII: For their community, at least a lot of them are citizens. In our community, we have two Samoans. We have western Samoans and we have American Samoans.    American Samoans, we are nationals, U.S. nationals, and we have the freedom of going back and forth. We don't require visas and all.    Western Samoa, which makes up the biggest population of us Samoans out here, a lot of them are here no on visa. They came in a group and some of them stayed over. Some of them are here just like other aliens or non-residents. These make up the biggest part of our population here.    So, when we counted the census, we found it very difficult to account for because they are so afraid -- like they said, I am so afraid to put my name down because they are going to go to the immigration office. They are going to report me.    These are people we are finding that are so underserved. We have so much problem with them with the diabetes that we have just finished, the two years that we have done these diabetes studies, we have gone out to the communities, do blood culture, find out who is diabetic.    We find out from Dr. Mao that you are diabetic and you are not diabetic and controlled by diet or something like that.    We found out that a lot of them are diabetic, about half the people I work with, I go around and ask them, make them feel comfortable. Tell them we are not reporting anything to anybody. This is confidential. Then they start to come out, are you sure.    Every Sunday we have gone to different churches to tell them about the diabetes project, tell them what we are doing, what we are helping them, giving them treatment, and they say, are you sure.    This is the question, are you sure you are not going to report anybody. I say, we are not here to report anybody. We are not. We have nothing to do with immigration.    We do not care if you are here legally or illegally. What we care about is your health. We are concerned about you. And these are the people that we are having problems to reach out, the biggest population of Samoans.    MS. MAYS: Nancy, I know you have a question.     MS. BREEN: Yes, I don't know if you will be able to answer this question, Salla, but you mentioned that you had actually collected some data, it sounded like, through the church population that you and Dr. Mao had outreached into.      I wondered -- you said it is under analysis now. Is that something that --      MS. MATAALII: It should be really coming out. It is under Little Company of Mary Hospital. The funding was under them, and we have collected. We have gone out and screened over 1,000 people and break it down into diabetes and diabetic patients, and provided the care for them, free medications, four times the doctor would visit, get them medications.    At the same time, we have done the big studies. We had a big questionnaire survey and those are data that they are collecting and, from that diabetes project alone, we have collected a lot of data, and those are being analyzed right now. I was told it should be coming out soon.    MS. BREEN: Is that something you could make available to the committee, to at least provide some preliminary information on Samoans?    MS. MATAALII: That should be made available, because that will be very, very helpful.    MS. BREEN: Did we see data on the proportion of Samoans living in California? Do most Samoans who are not in Samoa live in California; do you know?    MS. MATAALII: The biggest population of Samoans outside Samoa is here in California, right here in California, besides Hawaii.    MS. BREEN: So, that would be a helpful sample, I think.    MS. MAYS: Thank you. What we are going to do is introduce two other speakers. The traffic today -- first of all, what I have to say is, their stories I know but I have to let people tell their own stories. I am learning about that.    Many of the people who are sitting here today with us really went out of their way to be here, so I really want to acknowledge that.    I mean, when I joked and teased about traffic, it is beyond just traffic. I think Dr. Kagawa-Singer was talking earlier about the fact that, you know, the community, people are very active.    What they try to do is make sure that when things happen that they are able to be there. and people have done that at personal sacrifice relative to things in their lives and things they have to take care of.    Some have even felt like, well, you know, they are not the speaker to be here, but I think from all of us sitting here, the people sitting here were the speakers, because it is very clear, in terms of the committee, that we are learning a tremendous amount.    I am just hoping that our ability will be to translate this into something that will be very useful. So, I also welcome you.    Again, you were here yesterday and I welcome you back today, and I really appreciate your also coming back to take the time to speak with us.    I don't know who wants to start first or how you want to do it.      Agenda Item: Remarks by Jane Pang.    MS. J. PANG: My name is Jane Carla Pang. I am a retired nurse from L.A. County with 37 years experience in what we call continuity of care, discharge planner.    I am also a retired case manager. So, I will speak for one entity regarding health disparities, and specific to the major categories of chronic disease, they are cancers, all sites, including breast cancer, cervical cancer, diabetes, heart disease, strokes, horrible strokes. I just got news last night that one of our members had a severe massive stroke.    I guess we are here to really -- we are the invisible community, the cell that is too small to be counted, the cell that needs to be over-sampled.    All of my sisters here, and cousins, are facing the same dilemma. We get our community out and those who participate in the census, we get our numbers in, but we sort of feel that it is sort of futile because, when you start adding up and analyzing it, we don't make the threshold.    Especially Native Hawaiians. We are so well disseminated throughout L.A. County and the nation, in every state including Alaska, but I am sure if you looked at one county or one city or maybe even one target zone area, that we still are below, because we are so disseminated.    We have a particular concern -- and you probably brought forth the issue of multi-race identification. I am Hawaii born. I am Chinese Japanese extraction, and this is my husband.    MR. V. PANG: I am a Native Hawaiian, and I also have Chinese extraction, but I am real proud of being a Native Hawaiian.    For the past almost 20 years I have bene working with other Pacific Islanders who have the same health disparities.    Some of them are even more so because they only understand one language, and that is their native language. So, a lot of times they depend on their children to tell them about the documents they are reading in English.    So, the child is describing it in childlike nouns and verbs, constructing the sentences. If you have a government document to read, it is very hard for even people with a college education to really read and comprehend and understanding.    Here you are having a child with maybe a fourth and sixth grade education to translate it. So, that was part of the dilemma when a lot of our enumerators, when they went out to the communities that only spoke mono-language, so their native language.    That was real hard and, like Salla was saying, the mistrust, because they may have 15 in the family, but yet, they remember signing a contract in the apartment code that says no more than three families, no more than two families, and here they have 15. So, they are very wary about that. So, they are always asking questions, what is this for.    I know the census people, they were real good in coming out, none of this information will be used against you and it is all confidential, but you know, they know this is the big government that has access to all the computers, and they are just wary about it.    Also, none of the data is shared back with the community. You may see all of the data appearing on the newspaper one day and you say, well, I thought the community was going to be first to get the data and chew on the data to see how it affects them.    We do not have any social services that advocate for Native Hawaiians or for other Pacific Islanders. If not, they are very few or nil.    In Hawaii, they are real good, in that they have one agency that takes care of all the Native Hawaiians, and that is good for them, but all the funding just goes to Hawaii.    For a lot of Pacific Islanders, like the Marshallese, all the funding goes back to the Marshall Islands. So, none of it gets here and they have a lot of needs up here in Arkansas.    During the census, they were approximately almost 10,000 of them in Springdale, Arkansas, and they wanted the census document translated.     So, we had to send some Marshallese that work on our council to go back there and to give them a workshop. They gladly went out, but it was on our nickel, and we couldn't find any funding so we said, well, we had to do this.      So, we sent them to Arkansas. We also sent them to the state of Washington. Otherwise, they would be completely invisible, but these are real small cells. You are talking about 10,000 here, 6,000 in another area.    Hawaiians, there may be 40,000 in one particular area that comprises three or four counties, and Samoans, they may be, on the paper, about 15,000 situated in three or four counties in the Southern California area.    So, you are talking about people who don't even make the threshold of what the census says, you know, we are going to sample in that area.    When you say, well, we would like to have over-sampling, they sort of say, well, that is not in the game plan right now, but we will take that under consideration.    MS. PANG: We would like to speak on behalf of the other communities. We speak on behalf of, as you well know, Polynesian, Micronesian, Melanesians.    Within the council, we were blessed with the initiation of the Office of Samoan Affairs and the 1980 census brought our community together. We knew not that we were even there.    We met each other and, as a result of that, we went on in 1991 and organized a formal group. It is just a volunteer coalition, absolutely not funded. It is all of us pulling together when we felt we needed to do something.    Until the government or other agencies realize we are there and can partner with us, we are missing the 32 year old who had multisite cancers, surgerized at L.A. County Medical Center, follow up care was given in Pasadena, California, which was about five to eight miles from L.A. County in Central L.A. The family resides in Costa Mesa, California, Orange County. I am a county employee, so I take some responsibility with that.    Two years later the father calls me, who is a deacon, the minister, for their church and says, my daughter is bleeding from a tumor on her neck. I said, well, she had an abdominal tumor. Now what is happening?    In the two years, she spouted two more tumors, was emergency admitted to Orange County, subsequently died two-and-a-half years later. It is cases like this ongoing.    They are Marshallese, they don't speak the native language. They must have an interpreter and, as of today, there is no health interpreter for them.    So, I am trying to organize, with the Marshallese community, and facilitate a language workshop in which they can be certified and trained through PALS, a Pacific Asian Language Services, to train them, so they can be certified in health.    Incidents go on and on. They are anecdotal. They don't have the funders with numbers, because we don't have the numbers, but I think there is a volume of individual calls we get.    Three generations of breast cancer in Native Hawaiians who, for some reason, despite our active campaign, get in too late and are devastated with metastasis and face a life term at 30 of five years or less. It goes on and on.     Vic is a cancer survivor, and this is why we took up the cause without any funding, because we felt that someone had to do it.    There are many grass roots organizations that we have networked who are doing it, because it has to be done. We can't wait.     I think the census came out this year saying that we were probably the youngest population in the United States. One has to wonder why. I know the reason why. We don't survive.    Until we address the small subpopulations, we are going to continue to be the youngest population in the United States.    So, I guess we are here in desperation saying, we are not the experts. You need to help us. You are the scholars, the scientists. How can you help us volunteers with our project, because our community is dying. There is no other answer.    As a health practitioner, like Salla and me, we are nurses. We know what services are there. We can't do it alone. We need some help.    MS. MAYS: Thank you. Let me also open it up, again, for my colleagues and then to the audience. Are there any questions here?    MR. HITCHCOCK: I have one question. It is a little bit off the topics we have discussed, but I think, Mae, you alluded to it, that the population of Guam on the island is not necessarily the population that it used to be.    I was just wondering about the effects of immigration from other areas in the Pacific, mostly, I guess, to Guam and to American Samoa and then, in turn, how those folks may be integrating further into the mainland United States, or looking for services as well.    MS. GUENTHER: Most of the Chamorrans, yes, do relocate here. The major reason is health issues, medical insurance. They can come over here, get a job and get some form of insurance.    If they can't get a job right away, they are still able to get some medical assistance.    MR. HITCHCOCK: What about non-Chimorrans. What about people from other Pacific groups?    MS. GUENTHER: There is a large Filipino, Vietnamese. The military left, but then they came back.    MS. BREEN: I was involved in a conversation at I think it was the ICC in a cultural cancer conference maybe last year, with Dr. Friedman, who runs the NCI Center for Cancer Health Disparities. I work at the National Cancer Institute, in the Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences. I am an economist there.    There has been some concern expressed to Dr.Friedman, and they thought maybe he could help, about I think it was the Marshall Islands in particular.      So, we found an expert, somebody who knew something about the health care in the Marshall Islands. I wonder if you could confirm this or provide a little bit more detail and light on that.    Basically -- and I think Guam and the Marshall Islands were in the same situation, the way that he described it.    Other than the traditional health care that is available to people who live outside the American bases, there is basically no health system there. There aren't hospitals, there aren't clinics. The only hospitals are on the base and the people who are not affiliated directly with the base can't use those facilities. So, in other words, there is no health care.    Is that true, and is that underlying what you are talking about people coming to the United States for health care?    MS. GUENTHER: With my understanding, there is one hospital in Guam. The other hospital is a military hospital. The belief of most of the Chamorro people on Guam is, if you end up going to the hospital, you are not going to leave.    MS. BREEN: That is what they believe?    MS. GUENTHER: That is what they believe. Because of the nursing shortage over here, there has been -- the incentives that are offered over here, a lot of nurses have left Guam to come over here to work. So, they are very short staffed.     MS. J. PANG: Could I just add a comment? I think it was interesting. Your question was the access to health care on islands.    I think we from California are impressed with the fact there is no access to health care in the United States for Marshallese.    I think if you look at the number of Marshallese, which is a very small community located in about four major states -- Hawaii, Arkansas and California and Washington -- if they speak the native language, have no interpretive services or no access to services, they are not going to access the services.      I am working on a weekly basis with 15 Marshallese women. The entire program is translated. I have learned a new skill, to pause, take a breath, so they can translate, taking them through a year's course on general health 101, talking about healthy diets.    The major problem -- this is a group of women. Two are employed, who are currently unemployed because our tracheostomy producers went to South America. So, these two women are unemployed. So, I thought, great, I will use them, and they are my interpreters.    Well, out of the 15 women -- and this is just the kind of numbers I work with -- 65 percent of the group are diabetics, and these are generational diseases.    I don't want to know any more, as much as we need those numbers, but that is what my women are telling me. None of them coming from the islands, exposed to nuclear exposure during World War II, none of them have had a mammography.      We are talking about breast cancer, and that was the condition that I would volunteer to work with them, that all women would have a full physical, cervical, mammography, the whole exam, including dental and vision screening during the 12-month period.    Two thirds of them need MediCal and right now, because of immigration restrictions, they are not sure whether they qualify or not, because no one can understand the pact.    So, we are facing, I am doing the best I can, but I keep getting these huge governmental barriers that I cannot even go there because I don't have the expertise or the resources to address them, but I am taking these 15 women shopping, learning to cook differently, learning about the health things related to diet management.    All of us are obese. So, we share something in common. So, we know our goal is to lose, if we can, during the year period. So, we are all working together as a group.     These Marshallese women feel at this point they have no access to current California resources for health care. So, as we talk about the islands, I just want to insert, don't forget, we have a group here and they really are having such difficulties.    MS. MATAALII: If I may add to what she was saying earlier, in the island, in Guam, it is a very similar situation with us in American Samoa.    We have one major hospital, just one main hospital on the island. We have a chronic shortage of nurses. The retired nurses, who have been retired for how many years, they are asking them to come back and work. There is a shortage of nurses, a shortage of doctors.    We don't have specialists back home. That is why there is a big influx of people coming from back home over here, looking for medical help. When they come here, it is even worse here, because a lot of them -- I shared with you earlier, the biggest populations are from Western Samoa, who are non-resident, who a lot of them are so scared, you know, they are looking for relatives to come here, and are looking for medical help.    So, a lot of them are not qualified for any kind of medical help. I mean, the immigration issue is a different story.    Even we have some ones who are U.S. nationals, they are coming here, they don't understand the whole process of how you can qualify for MediCal or Medicare. A lot of them are depending on their families here, their grandchildren, to help interpret for them.    The whole process, the system, how to go about getting Medicare and MediCal, it is very difficult for these people.    I have worked as part of HOPIS program with the Guam Communication Network, we have worked on translating these forms. We have held a focus group, how to help our community understand how to be qualified for MediCal so they can get some kind of medical help. It is very difficult.    You try to tackle one thing and something else -- it is unbelievable. With no funding, it is very difficult for us to do any kind of work.    The small funding we had, the subcontract, this is the only funding we used, and we used it for everything, to help pay for women to find a doctor.      You know, a mother has an abnormal mammogram, we have to find a doctor. We have to find a doctor who can provide free medical care, and then we have to pick them up, transportation wise, pick them up and interpret for them.    It is a component of so many problems medically, and us in the medical field, in 28 years, I have seen it all, in my own community.    Yes, I have met a lot of the Marshallese through Chang Pang(?). My heart goes out to them. I have met them at some of the conferences. They shared his story. They had a difficult time accessing any care.     MS. GUENTHER: If I can add to that, I recently met a woman. She was Chamorro. She was diagnosed with breast cancer. Because she was under 40, the insurance company said they wouldn't treat her, because you only get breast cancer if you are 40 or older. She was in her early 30s.    Her husband had to go and fight the insurance company. So, one of the things, who determines that if you are over 40 years old you get breast cancer but, if you are under 40, you can't. I mean, it was a struggle, because that was his biggest fight.    They said, well, she can't have breast cancer. She is under 40. Well, excuse me. It is not your breast.    MS. BREEN: I was just wondering, we on this committee don't have the option of helping to fill in the gaps that you have so eloquently told us about today.     Our mission is to try to document these issues. Clearly, there is a huge gap right there in the community, which that is the part that we would like to help to fill.    There was a group here yesterday, the Special Service for Groups. Are you involved in that? Have they been able to help with some of the data needs?    It strikes me that all of you who are health care providers are in a position to collect, maybe not a population-based survey, but to use the data that you have at your disposal to begin to document some of the very chronic health issues that you are aware of, just by observing it.    I wonder if an organization like this or some -- you could be linked to some other groups that could help you with that documentation process.     MS. J. PANG: Again, the reality is, if they did study our populations using the census data, when they go to their smallest threshold, many of our communities don't meet that threshold. So, we are not even in the mix. We don't even make it to the gate, because our numbers are so small.    Most of the SSG information that I have gotten, there was very little specifically Pacific Islanders, but our ambition is to have them do strictly Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander training.    Jerry Wong for the census did that, and he opened our eyes to a lot of numbers that we are still ruminating about, but the reality is, when we get into health care and health disparities, are there sufficient data, because I fear that our threshold is below that, so we will never have an opportunity.      MS. MATAALII: We have been involved with SSG for a couple of years now. They still have very limited data on our community. We are subcontractors with them, but we are just about going out and do this, and college the status.    MS. J. PANG: SSG is restricted.    MS. MATAALII: Very restricted, and they have been around for a long time and they don't provide the data for us. We are still trying to collect this data and submit it, whatever is required for the activities that we are sending in. So, ask them about the data they have? We are already subcontractors.    MS. GUENTHER: There is the privacy act, because all of our clients -- from my understanding, having just taken over care, we were informed, because I had several Guam referrals and I thought, how can I help these people, because they don't live here necessarily permanently.    Some of them are having to choose to live here permanently, but now they are having the problem of now they need to find a place to live.    So, recently, between David and Lola, David going back to AAA, he found out that, yes, we could help them out, but then, again, this is just new. So, any data that we have in numbers, again, we are just starting. That doesn't count for all the people that went through.    MS. MATAALII: And limited funding. The programs that -- our subcontract to them is just tobacco, and it has to do with tobacco and managed care, but all the other issues that we shared earlier, diabetes, cholesterol, I mean, heart disease, stroke, they haven't been able to collect anything.    Now I know why, because we don't have any programs under them on those conditions.    MS. MAYS: I want to make sure that we also allow people who are in the audience to come up. If you have a question or comment, please come up to the mike.    MS. LUCE: Pat Luce. In reference to data, this is one of the reasons why we have been so adamant that we have got to have Native Hawaiian and other Pacific in, across the board.    When we look at the cancer registry, the SEER information, when we look at the hospital when the clients go in, they begin to identify at that level who they are and where they are and so forth.    Even clinical trials, when you go there to try to abstract and identify how many patients reflect this group and that group, we don't exist.    We have, in the past, fallen in the larger category of Asian Pacific Islander, and when we try to extract Pacific Islanders from that, it is a very difficult process.    So, what you are finding here, we are, on a daily basis, addressing the needs in our community. Because of the smallness of numbers, or what is known as an insignificant number, this is what we are faced with.    We are also asking those who work with the smaller populations, see how you are addressing them, and look at how you can fold us into that same process.      I know that, with the SEER registry, that there is a special effort right now addressing American Indians. We are hoping that you take the same kind of approach in looking into our populations. Otherwise, we will continue on being left out.    It is very difficult for us to address treatment, and to know how to deal with intervention and prevention, if we don't know what we are dealing with. Thank you.    MS. MAYS: Any other comments? Anyone else in the audience that wants to make a comment? June, would you like to make any other comments?    MS. POUESI: Thank you very much, Madam Chair. All I wanted to add, also, is for information. If you are looking for information, specifically, the only Pacific Islander research that was done recently, we are using that to model for the other Pacific Islander, is the one that was done through the National Office of Samoan Affairs, known as the Native American Samoan Cancer Control research, which was done in collaboration with the University of California Irvine.    That is the so-called model that is going through the circles of those who are addressing it, and this is funded by NCI.    Presently, also, we have the Pacific Islander cancer control network, again, funded by NCI. It is 18 special population groups under, I believe. Dr. Jackson that has a focus on -- unfortunately, we don't have the Native Hawaiians in this component. It is the Tongan, the Chamorro and the Samoans, and it takes into consider two of each group, one in Utah, one in San Mateo, which are the Tongan component. The other is the U.S. Territory of Guam, and San Diego under the Sons and Daughters of Guam, and the Samoan component is the Native American Samoan Advisory Council, led by Paramount Chief Naliai(?) in American Samoa, and I am the other PI for the office of Samoan Affairs.     Those are the models that you can look at. Now, for the Native Hawaiian component, it is coming under Imihali(?). That is specifically a very interesting model which utilizes a CBO.    They themselves take it and they contract different universities, and that is the model that we are looking at for future for all of the other Pacific Islanders.    In that PICCN, there is an infrastructure set up. What that infrastructure set up is that we are taking the same model for the American Samoan research that ties the community people with what is available in their health resources in the region.    For instance, here for my region, we have the Harbor General, UCLA. The systems administrator sits on that advisory.    From the American Cancer Society we have Rosa Cosa(?) from the Long Beach area. From the YWCA Encore, which provides the mammogram and pap smear, we have Sylvia. I forget what the last name is. We also have Dr. Mao sitting on that, and from the nurses group, we have Salla Mataalii.    These are the things that we are trying to do, is to build it and then move it over to share. So, wherever in the United States that the Pacific Islanders are, the model can be taken and moved there, because it is culturally and linguistically sensitive to those populations, developed by the population itself.    Focus groups were done in the population and evaluated, based on that, through the NCI and through the universities. That is just a comment that you may want to look at.    MS. J. PANG: With such great models -- and I commend you for taking the step -- I am in Orange County and I have a small grant through Susan J. Coleman, and with that, one of our projects with the Wanda J. Cobb Cancer Survivors Network.    I think as we build these great networks, we need to build, as islanders, a safety net. A young native Samoan, who came to the United States in November to take care of her husband, who was under lung treatment with UCI, discovered inadvertently that she had breast cancer, had some major interventions.    She brought her young children to the United States where she then entered the therapeutic chemotherapy radiation period, came up to us in March and said, you know, I have bene here.    She is an American Samoan here in Orange County living in a motel, with her mother brought out with children, trying to manage without that link.    I was surprised, only because I knew that they were doing some partnerships with UCI. I said, haven't you networked with your community? Hasn't anyone at UCI connected you with the Samoan Affairs or SANA or any of the Pacific Islander groups?    So, as of November she existed in the community without any of the supports and, as soon as I found that out, I started making calls and, thanks to Salla's network, we got help to her.    Here, we build these great models and we forget, in their own institutions, why isn't there that network? Although we make good as a model, we have to be careful. The community still falls through the cracks and we have to prevent that, and we have to cover ourselves with some type of netting, because those young couples are falling through and families are being devastated as a result of it, but mahala for taking on her cause.    MS. POUESI: If I may respond to what you are stating, thank you for referring the gal, and we were able to address it and we were able to identify who her family was here.    I was just in American Samoa last week for one of the networks that was headed by Paramount Chief Naliai. The president of the community college was there, and I had presented that issue of that particular case they had.    What they are looking at is a network between American Samoa and here, to find out what resources we have here, tie it together, and I think we need to use that with the other Pacific Islander groups.    MS. BREEN: I am sorry, this shows my ignorance, but the Paramount Chief, is that the person who is like a mayor?    MS. POUESI: He is the district governor for the Manoa Islands. American Samoa is -- the two main islands are Tutuela, there is Ono and there is Manoa, and there is a Rose Island and Swain's Island.    He heads one of the main island groups, and his chief title is a very high title, meaning that he has a lot of say in terms of what happens there.    What Salla was stating, you really have to have a navigator. If you don't know anybody in the community, you are not going anywhere. The best thing to do is go to the chief or go to someone who is identified as a respected person in that particular community, and then that person serves as your navigator in your research that you need to do.    A lot of your research has to be done on a one-to-one person kind of situation. Don't use the phone. The phone is always disconnected. Don't use that.    It is better for you to go in on the one to one, sitting face to face. If a navigator takes you in, you have got your foot in the community.    If you go in by yourself, the door will always be closed to you. These are just things that, when I talk to other entities -- being education, social services and so forth -- those are the main things the keys have to be put in.      In reference to American Samoa, the migration, the main migration came out in 1952 with the USS Jackson. A thousand families came out under the movement from the Department of the Navy and it was moved over to the Department of Interior.    The people had to decide, who were in the navy, are they going to leave or are they going to stay. That gives you an idea why the people moved. There was also a famine at that time.     So, with 1,000 of the people going in, they met the same type of things the refugees met. These people are taking our jobs, they are taking all the housing. There are problems.    So, it was not indigenous to only us as American Samoans, but it was things you see as new emerging migrations coming in to the United States.    Some of the patterns I would recommend that you look at and you see some you can use. Others you have to adjust according to the culture, and the manner that it has evolved, just for your information.     MS. MATAALII: Just to add what to what June is saying, you need a navigator. This is exactly why we were so successful in outreaching the community through this diabetes program. The core of our community is churches here, for the Samoan community and I am sure with the other Pacific island community.     We don't have like villages, but here, the core of the community is churches. So, in order for us to be successful to outreach our community, you have to go through the ministers.    That is the only reason why we were successful in outreaching a lot of our Samoan community, is that we contacted the ministers.    I have often shared, at different conferences I attended, they often asked me to share why we were successful in some of the outreach we have done.    This is the reason why. You have to know the community. You outreach through the chiefs. Like Chief Laliai, he has got so much authority back home, that he has a lot of say so. He carries a lot of clout in the community.    So, here we go through our ministers and, through our ministers, we penetrate the churches, the members, and that is how we were successful, teaching them, holding different classes.    The education classes were in their halls, in their community. Make them part of our effort, of our programs. That is the most successful program I have ever worked with, but it was only supposed to be a year. It was funded by L.A. Care.    We were able to stretch the money to be able to do it for a year and eight months. Unfortunately, there is no more funding, and we stopped the program just like that, but we met our target.    We screened over 1,000 people. We held different education classes for them and completed a lot of our medical care.    If we provide the money for diabetes, to teach them how to do your own screening, how to monitor your blood sugar, what to watch for in terms of nutrition, it is important.    This is the biggest part of our community. They love to eat. Therefore, it was very difficult to even touch on nutrition.    You know, Dr Mao and I would be standing there and they are laughing. What are you talking about, you know. I mean, you are talking about how important the portion -- you know, eating a meal each day, if you are diabetic, to this day, it is very difficult for me to think about, how do we penetrate the community.    We have seen so many of them that have made a change in their lives, that changed their lives. They know about diabetes, what to watch for, the symptoms, the risk factors.    I mean, these are the things that we are hoping that we can take out to our community and teach them, increase their awareness of the illnesses and the diseases that are affecting our own people.    MS. MAYS: Thank you. Before we end this session, I just want to see if Dr. Kagawa-Singer has any comments she wants to make, because she has been kind of the navigator for us, to make sure that we got such great people here.    MS. KAGAWA-SINGER: [Comments off microphone].     MS. MAYS: I want to echo what she has just said, which is, for us, part of what is important is, we can only speak in the sense of understanding.    I mean, we can read a lot of facts. We can find all the facts that tell us you don't have data. So, that is why I kept telling you, that part we knew, but I think it is the passion that you brought and the experience that you have with you, that helps us to be able to translate this.    Part of what we often talk about, when we try and make the case is, well, we need to make a business case, we sometimes say, meaning that we need to convince them that you are going to spend more money if you don't do this, or there is a problem if you don't do this.    So, what you have done today is translated things for us in a way in which it makes it easier for us to sit and try and think about presenting things and making a compelling case.    For those of you who are worried today about what to say, you did wonderful, as far as I am concerned. I can tell from my colleagues, who have been sitting here paying great attention.    So, I really want to thank you for the time that we have spent today. Some of you we got at the last hour. So, I know that you have many other things in your life going on. So, I am honored on behalf of the committee that you made the time.    As I know from my colleague, Dr. Kagawa-Singer, your phone probably rings all the time. People are probably knocking on your door, finding you in all kinds of ways, because you have many pressures, you are needed in so many places.    So, on behalf of the committee, we appreciate that you recognize that we want to do the best that we can do, and the only way that we can do the best we can do is really to have had you here today.    So, I appreciate your taking the time, and I am honored to have had your story as the chair of this group, but I also know my colleagues. We will take the integrity that goes with that being honored, and try to do the best that we can do, and translate this into something where we will try and make a difference.    We can't guarantee that we are going to change the world, but we can guarantee you that we will make the best attempt that we can, given how much we have learned.    I will say personally that I have learned a lot, and I thought Marjorie had already taught me a lot, but I have learned even more today.    So, really, from the bottom of my heart, I want to welcome you here, but I want to thank you also for sharing with us.    MR. V. PANG: I would like to thank you very much for being so patient in accommodating us, and for listening to the style that we give. It is just talk story type, rather than having a big agenda and power point and everything. Thank you very much. We are not high tech. Maybe the next time.    MS. J. PANG: Or maybe never.    MS. MAYS: I was going to say, you don't need to come to us that way.    MS. J. PANG: At least, mahala you, for the respect and to the attention to this and to our story. Can I say, on behalf of my community, that we would like to reciprocate, and your next visit to California, can we hold it in Carson where our community it, and let us host you?    So, your next meeting, if you would like to convene, come meet the Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders in their back yard.    MS. MAYS: Wait a minute, Marjorie is laughing. You missed one thing. I live here, so I will come and visit you, and I am all about being fed, so don't even worry about it.    MR. V. PANG: I now yesterday they were saying, where is the taro?    MS. MAYS: I love taro burgers.    MS. MATAALII: Madam Chairman, I can't help but sitting here thinking, it was just two years ago, or a year and a half ago, we had almost the same panel.     I don't remember any of you sitting there, but we had it at the Guam Communications Network office. As I am sitting here, these are the same concerns, not the same people, but there were representatives from our Pacific Island community.    I know there were representatives from Secretary Thompson's office. I mean, we shared the same concerns, the same issues.    I can't help it but going back and thinking, a year and a half ago, two years ago, I am thinking, what ever happened to that? Where did it go?    I hope that something will come after that. You know, we have poured out our hearts before. I am sorry, I have to share this, but I can't help sitting here thinking, we talked the same thing, shared the same stories and the same issues, and nothing has been done. Nothing has been done. I just want to share that feeling with you, that thought with you.    I don't mean to put you on the spot, but with all these issues, they have been shared many times, and I remember speaking for my community. Some of the chiefs of the community were there, from Chamorro, from Tongan, from -- you know, they were there. I just wanted to echo that.    MS. BREEN: It sounds like Secretary Thompson could use a reminder.    MS. MAYS: I am willing to be held accountable. Now, what I can do for the federal government, that is very different, but one of the things I will say is, I actually live her

The AA/PI population is expected to double in the next 25 years.  About 54% of AA/PIs live in western States, especially California and Hawaii.  18% live in the Northeast, 17% in the South, and 11% in the Midwest.    The AA/PI category is extremely diverse, with about 43 different ethnic subgroups.  While the majority of AA/PIs were born outside of the U.S., a large proportion of Chinese and Japanese Americans are 4th and 5th generation Americans.  Since the mid-1960s, the AA/PI population has grown rapidly with high rates of immigration from China, India, the Philippines, Korea, Vietnam, and Southeast Asia.  Most Pacific Islanders are not immigrants, but are descendants of the original inhabitants of land taken over by the United States – Hawaii, Tonga, Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Marshall Islands, the Caroline Islands, and Palau.    AA/PIs speak over 100 languages and dialects, and about 35% live in households where there is limited English proficiency in those over age 13.  Some subgroups have more limited English proficiency than others:  61% of Hmong-, 56% of Cambodian-, 52% of Laotian-, 44% of Vietnamese-, 41% of Korean-, and 40% of Chinese-American households are linguistically isolated.    There is a range of educational attainment in the AA/PI population.  In 2000, 44% of Asian American adults had a college or professional degree compared to 28% of white Americans.  58% of South Asian Americans (from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka) fell into this group.  In contrast, in 1990 only 12% of Hawaiians and 10% of other Pacific Islanders had completed college, and 2 out of 3 Cambodian-, Hmong-, and Laotian-American adults had not completed high school.       The average family income for AA/PIs is higher than the national average.  However, AA/PIs still have a lower per capita income and higher rate of poverty than non-Hispanic white Americans.  In 1990, about 14% of the whole AA/PI group was living in poverty, compared to 13.5% of all Americans, and 9% of non-Hispanic whites.  Among subgroups, poverty rates ranged from a low of 6% for Filipino Americans to a high of 64% among Hmong Americans.     Need for Mental Health Care    Our knowledge of the mental health needs of AA/PIs is limited.  National epidemiological studies have included few AA/PIs or people whose English is limited.  The largest study to focus on AA/PIs (i.e., the CAPES study) examined the prevalence of mood disorders in a predominantly immigrant Chinese American sample.  This study found lifetime and one-year prevalence rates for depression of about 7% and 3%, respectively.  These rates are roughly equal to general rates found in the same urban area.      While overall prevalence rates of diagnosable mental illnesses among AA/PIs appear similar to those of the white population, when symptom scales are used, AA/PIs show higher levels of depressive symptoms than do white Americans.  Furthermore, Chinese Americans are more likely to exhibit somatic complaints of depression than are African Americans or non-Hispanic whites.  Small studies of symptoms of emotional distress have found few differences between AAPI youth and white youth.    AA/PIs may experience culture-bound syndromes such as neurasthenia and hwa-byung Neurasthenia is characterized by fatigue, weakness, poor concentration, memory loss, irritability, aches and pains, and sleep disturbances.  Hwa-byung, or ""suppressed anger syndrome,"" is characterized by symptoms such as constriction in the chest, palpitations, flushing, headache, dysphoria, anxiety, and poor concentration.    Compared to the suicide rate of white Americans (12.8 per 100,000 per year), the rates for Filipino (3.5), Chinese (8.3), and Japanese (9.1) Americans are substantially lower.  However, Native Hawaiian adolescents have a higher risk of suicide than other adolescents in Hawaii, and older Asian American women have the highest suicide rate of all women over age 65 in the United States.  There is also a growing concern about increasing suicide rates in the Pacific Basin.    High-Need Populations     AA/PIs are not overrepresented among high-need, vulnerable populations such as people who are homeless, incarcerated, or have substance abuse problems.  However, they are heavily represented among refugees.  Many Southeast Asian refugees are at risk for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) associated with trauma experienced before and after immigration to the U.S.  One study found that 70% of Southeast Asian refugees receiving mental health care met diagnostic criteria for PTSD.  In a study of Cambodian adolescents who survived Pol Pot's concentration camps, nearly half experienced PTSD and 41% suffered from depression 10 years after leaving Cambodia.    Availability of Mental Health Services    Nearly 1 out of 2 AA/PIs will have difficulty accessing mental health treatment because they do not speak English or cannot find services that meet their language needs.  Approximately 70 AAPI providers are available for every 100,000 AA/PIs in the U.S., compared to 173 per 100,000 whites. No reliable information is available regarding the Asian language capabilities of mental health providers in the U.S.    Access to Mental Health Services      Overall about 21% of AA/PIs lack health insurance, compared to 16% of all Americans.  The rate of Medicaid coverage for eligible AA/PI families is well below that of whites.  For example, among families with incomes below 200% of the Federal poverty level, whites are twice as likely as Chinese Americans to enroll in Medicaid.  It has been suggested that lower Medicaid participation rates are, in part, due to widespread but mistaken concerns among immigrants that enrolling in Medicaid jeopardizes applications for citizenship.    Use of Mental Health Services    AA/PIs appear to have the extremely low utilization of mental health services relative to other U.S. populations.  For example, in the CAPES study, only 17% of those experiencing problems sought care.  Among AA/PIs who use services, severity of disturbance tends to be high, perhaps because AA/PIs tend to delay seeking treatment until symptoms reach crisis proportions.  While more research is needed, shame and stigma are believed to figure prominently in the lower utilization rates of AA/PI communities.  AA/PIs tend to use complementary therapies at rates equal to or higher than white Americans.    Appropriateness and Outcomes of Mental Health Services      Few studies examine the response of minorities to mental health treatment.  One study found that AAPI clients had poorer short-term outcomes and less satisfaction with individual psychotherapy than did white Americans.  Another study found that older Chinese Americans with symptoms of depression responded to cognitive-behavior therapy as did other multiethnic populations. AA/PI clients matched with therapists of the same ethnicity are less likely to drop out of treatment than those without an ethnic match.  Preliminary studies suggest that AA/PIs respond clinically to psychotropic medicines in a manner similar to white Americans but at lower average dosages.   Research is needed to identify key components of culturally appropriate services for AA/PIs.

Section 1  presents findings from user                research, including ""cultural usability"" tests conducted between                January 2003 and April 2003 to better understand online seekers                of Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and other Pacific Islander health                information.                Section 2  describes the specific goals                of the study and the report:                               Goal 1:   To assess the                  range of health information-seeking behaviors of intermediaries                  and individuals of Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and other                  Pacific Islander communities.                       Goal 2:   To identify tasks                  that intermediaries of Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and other                  Pacific Islander communities want to accomplish on a health information                  Web site.                         Goal 3:   To understand                  how Federal agencies can best serve Asian American, Native Hawaiian,                  and other Pacific Islander communities in the area of health education                  materials.                         Goal 4:   To investigate                  the overall usability of healthfinder®.                       Goal 5:                   To understand how healthfinder® can best serve intermediaries                  of Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and other Pacific Islander                  communities.

Launched in 1997,  healthfinder®                 is a portal site, linking the general public to reliable health                information resources. Known for being user-friendly,        healthfinder®                 is regularly evaluated by its users through interviews, usability                tests, online comments, and expert reviews.                 From August 2002 to November 2002, ODPHP conducted interviews and                usability tests 2  with American Indian                and Alaska Native leaders, patients, and students in Anchorage,                the Navajo Nation, and Denver to identify their needs and preferences                for online health information. ODPHP identified user personas and                tasks that American Indian and Alaska Native populations wanted                to accomplish on a health Web site. Due to the success of this model                in involving the community, and developing user personas and the                user task matrix in the enhancement of  healthfinder® ,                ODPHP adapted a similar process for expanding resources for Asian                American, Native Hawaiian, and other Pacific Islander populations                in 2003.           Because of the diverse and multilingual needs of these populations,                ODPHP decided to test the concept of delivering a searchable database                of multilingual patient education materials, each paired with its                English equivalent to support its use by intermediaries. Our first                goal was to identify a collection of translated materials for the                top nine Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and other Pacific Islander                languages spoken at home, based on Census 2000 data, which are Chinese,                Hmong, Khmer, Korean, Laotian, Samoan, Thai, Tongan, and Vietnamese. 3                 Our second goal was to develop, with the community, a user-friendly                Web portal for delivering this collection of materials.           From January 2003 to April 2003, ODPHP conducted a series of interviews and usability              tests with Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and other Pacific Islander              intermediaries. We received e-mail comments and suggestions and collected              qualitative data on how people in these communities access health              information on the Internet and how Federal agencies can best serve              their communities. ODPHP collected quantitative data on what the intermediaries              want to accomplish on a health Web site. Because of its limited scope,              this study is not representative of all Asian American, Native Hawaiian,              and other Pacific Islander peoples.

Identify who their sources of authoritative information                  are.                 Discover when they would use health information                  and why.                 Find out when they would use the Internet, and why they would choose                  this option.                                           Goal 2:  To identify tasks that intermediaries                of Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and other Pacific Islander communities                want to accomplish on a health information Web site.               Goal 3:  To understand how Federal agencies                can best serve Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and other Pacific                Islander communities in the area of health education materials.

Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and other Pacific Islanders                have lived in the United States since the 1800s. Together, they                represent the fastest growing minority population in America. In                2000, Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and other Pacific Islanders                combined numbered nearly 4 percent of the total U.S. population;                by 2020, this number is expected to reach 6 percent. 5               It is important to understand the different Asian American, Native                Hawaiian, and other Pacific Islander communities in this country                because they are not a homogeneous population. What we present here                is very brief; a better understanding of the culture and history                of each of these populations can be gained from reading  The New                Face of Asian Pacific America: Numbers, Diversity, & Change                in the 21st Century  by Eric Lai and Dennis Arguelles. 5               Asian Americans              Nearly 12 million people identified themselves as                Asian 6  in 2000, compared to 6.9 million                in 1990. Compared to the total U.S. population, which experienced                a growth of 13 percent in this time period, the Asian American population                grew by 72 percent. Some 1.3 million Asian Americans live below                the poverty line. Sixty-nine percent of Asian Americans are born                outside of the United States. 5  The leading                causes of death for Asian Americans are cancer, heart disease, and                stroke 7  (see  table                1 ).                                                                     Table 1: Ten leading                    causes of death in the United States in 2000 for Asian Americans                                                    Cancer                                                    Heart disease                                                    Stroke                                                    Unintentional injuries                                                    Chronic lower respiratory disease                                                    Influenza and pneumonia                                                    Diabetes                                                    Suicide                                                    Nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and nephrosis                                                    Birth defects                                                  The six largest groups of Asian Americans include Chinese, Filipinos,                Asian Indians, Vietnamese, Koreans, and Japanese, and these groups                comprise numerous subgroups such as South Asians, Southeast Asians,                and Hapas.                South Asian Americans encompass nearly 2 million people whose origins                are from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Myanmar                (formerly Burma), Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Tibet. 8                 Among South Asian Americans, 21 percent have no health insurance,                25 percent are limited in English proficiency, and 25 percent live                in households with incomes below $25,000. South Asian languages                most commonly spoken in the United States include Bengali, Gujarati,                Hindi, Punjabi, and Urdu.               Southeast Asian Americans include people whose origins are from                Cambodia, Laos, Thai, and Vietnam. 5                 The main ethnic groups include Khmer, Hmong (from the northern mountains                of Laos), Laotian, Thai, and Vietnamese. They are the largest group                of refugees to come to the United States in the past 30 years and                number approximately 1.5 million. Because of their refugee status,                many Southeast Asian Americans face economic hardship, lack of higher                learning opportunities, and lack of parental supervision due to                long work hours. Many of them do not become U.S. citizens because                of language barriers. Poverty rates are high with Khmer (and Hmong                populations (47 percent and 67 percent, respectively).               Hapas are Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and other Pacific                Islanders of mixed heritage. Numbering 2.1 million people in the                United States, Hapas are the second-largest subgroup after Chinese.                The term ""Hapa"" originated in Hawaii to describe those of mixed                White and Hawaiian descent. 5               Native Hawaiians (Kanaka Maoli)               Nearly 874,000 people reported being Native Hawaiian or Pacific                Islander. Of this demographic group, 141,000 people identified themselves                as Native Hawaiian only; they are the largest Pacific Islander group.                In Hawaii, Native Hawaiians earn lower incomes, hold lower status                jobs, and have the highest rate of unemployment of all ethnic groups                living on the Hawaiian islands. 5                   Other Pacific Islanders               Of the 874,000 people who reported being Native Hawaiian or other                Pacific Islander, 398,000 people reported being Pacific Islanders                only. After Native Hawaiians, the largest Pacific Islander groups                are Samoan and Guamanian/Chamorro.                The majority of Pacific Islanders live in six island jurisdictions:                American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands,                the Federated States of Micronesia, Guam, the Republic of the Marshall                Islands, and the Republic of Palau. These populations are diverse                in language and culture.               Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders tend                to lag behind other races in income, median earnings, and educational                attainment, especially those age 25 and older. Native Hawaiians                and other Pacific Islanders also have higher rates of unemployment                (10.4 percent for men and 10.9 percent for women) than the general                U.S. population (5.7 percent). Sixty-five thousand Native Hawaiians                and other Pacific Islanders live below the poverty line. The leading                causes of death for Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders                are cancer, heart disease, and stroke 9                 (see  table 2 ).

However, 1.4 million                Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, or 13 percent of this population,                were living at or below the Federal poverty level in 1998. Two million                Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders do not have health insurance;                Korean Americans have the highest rate (40 percent) of noninsurance. 11                 Some 17.7 percent of Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders                (22.7 percent for Pacific Islander children) lived in poverty compared                to a national rate of 12.4 percent. Twenty-nine percent of Asian-language                households were linguistically isolated—that is, all the adults                in these households (high school age and older) had limitations                in communicating in English.

While some contemporary APA [Asian and Pacific American] communities                  have prospered, others face significant economic development challenges                  as APAs are amongst the richest and poorest, the best educated                  and least educated of all Americans.                 —Paul Ong and Doug Miller 12                             Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and other Pacific Islander communities                are more vulnerable to depression and other mental health disorders                due to stress related to immigration and acculturation, as well                as cultural values regarding health care, disease, and family honor. 13               Internet Use               The Pew Internet and American Life Project 14                 found that 75 percent of English-speaking Asian American adults                have gone online, compared to 58 percent of White adults, 50 percent                of English-speaking Hispanic American adults, and 43 percent of                African American adults.               With more than 5 million Asian Americans online, they are the Web's                most experienced ethnic group. Seventy percent of Asian American                Internet users are online on a typical day, compared to 58 percent                of White Internet users. Eighty percent of Asian Americans have                been using the Web for more than 2 years. In addition, Asian American                users stay online longer than anyone else. Forty percent of Asian                American Internet users stay online for 2 or more hours. About 15                percent spend 4 or more hours online at a time.               Lack of Internet access is a major issue for Native Hawaiians and                Pacific Islanders. Efforts are underway to connect all Hawaiians                who live on homestead lands.               Health Disparities               Significant health disparities exist among Asian American, Native                Hawaiian, and other Pacific Islander populations, especially in                cardiovascular disease, cancer (liver, lung, nasopharyngeal, cervical,                breast, stomach, and colorectal), diabetes, family violence, hepatitis                B and C, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, mental health, and substance abuse. 15                               Although Asian Americans represent 4 percent of the population,                  they account for more than half of the 1.3 million chronic hepatitis                  B cases in the United States. 5        Fifty-five percent of Tongan women, 74 percent of Samoan women, and 77 percent of men and women                  living in Nauru are obese. 16       Native Hawaiians have the highest mortality rates and the lowest life expectancy among the five                  major ethnic populations in Hawaii. 17       Asian American women over age 65 have the highest female suicide rate across all racial/ethnic                  groups. 18                      Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, and Korean immigrants consistently                  report higher numbers of depressive symptoms than do Whites. 19                    Analysis of data collected in Hawaii from 1996 to 2000 showed                  that Native Hawaiians were 2.5 times more likely than non-Hispanic                  White residents of similar age to have diabetes. 20                             Back to Table of Contents                                                                                  Section 4 - Study Overview                                                      Audience        Methods        Limitations of the Study                              This section identifies the research audiences and summarizes the                research process.               Audience                ODPHP interviewed 30 Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and other                Pacific Islander intermediaries and received online comments from                108 additional intermediaries ( appendix                A ) representing these target populations. Intermediaries were                asked about their own use of the Internet as well as use by the                communities they serve.                To synthesize the research findings into a useful tool for Web                development, we extracted similarities to build audience profiles                or user personas.  Appendix B  provides                brief personas of typical Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and other                Pacific Islander intermediaries, organized into the following eight                categories that reflect the context in which they might use the                Internet to find health information.                               Executive directors                 Health educators and social workers                 Legislative analysts                 Librarians                 Physicians and nurses                 Program administrators                 Researchers                 Traditional healing practitioners.                             Interviewed intermediaries were selected based on word-of-mouth recommendations from the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and the Office of Minority Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.     Other intermediaries who participated self-selected to provide comments via e-mail or an online form.  The White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and the American Public Health Association's Asian Pacific Islander Caucus sent out e-mails to their listservs requesting participation.                  Methods              ODPHP solicited feedback from intermediaries in three ways, as                described below.          Letter.  The White House Initiative on                Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders e-mailed a letter via e-mail                to their listservs to inform intermediaries about this project and                request their participation. The main goal was to identify tasks                that they might want to accomplish on a health information Web site.                Between January 27 and February 19, 2003, 42 intermediaries submitted                comments via e-mail to ODPHP.                           Interviews:  From March 17 to April                10, 2003, ODPHP conducted 30 one-hour interviews and usability tests                on a prototype version of healthfinder®'s Asian American, Native                Hawaiian, and other Pacific Islander section (see                 figure 1 ) with intermediary audiences. These interviews were                conducted at intermediaries' workplace environment, where they normally                access the Internet. For nonlocal intermediaries, ODPHP interviewed                the person over the telephone.                     Online form:  To validate and rank the tasks that 42 intermediaries suggested as things they might want to accomplish on a health information Web site, the American Public Health Association's Asian Pacific Islander Caucus sent a request to its listserv asking members to complete an online form.  Between March 17 and April 20, 2003, 66 intermediaries (including most of the 30 intermediaries interviewed directly) submitted comments online to ODPHP.  They also had the option of providing additional feedback about topics that were most important to the communities they served and identifying quality translated materials.                                                                                  Figure 1: Prototype version                  tested in March 2003                              Limitations of the Study     Due to limited resources,              ODPHP interviewed only 30 intermediaries for this project. We did              not get the opportunity to speak in person to the other respondents              who contributed comments via e-mail or the online form. The following              limitations were identified:      Tasks identified by intermediaries were mixed between what they want to perform on behalf of their clients and what they want to do for themselves.      Tape recorder documentation was incomplete for two participants.      Views represented in this report reflect the experiences of only the 30 intermediaries interviewed.                Interviews and usability tests were performed over the phone for              nonlocal interviewees.

Goal 1:  To assess the range of                health information-seeking behaviors of intermediaries and individuals                of Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and other Pacific Islander communities.                               Identify who their sources of authoritative information                  are.                 Discover when they would use health information                  and why.                 Find out when they would use the Internet, and                  why they would choose this option.                              Intermediaries              Most Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and other Pacific                Islander interviewees used the Internet to find health information                for themselves and others. All interviewees had completed a college                degree, 73 percent had advanced degrees. Sixty percent used the                Internet more than 2 hours per day. Those who used the Internet                fewer than 2 hours a day usually requested staff to access the Internet                on their behalf. Eighty percent accessed the Internet both at home                and at the office. Fifty percent of those who accessed the Internet                at home had broadband service. The intermediaries considered Government                Web sites to be authoritative sources of information. Many used                a search engine such as Google as a starting point.               Communities              Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and other Pacific                Islander communities are extremely diverse. According to the intermediaries,                access to the Internet directly correlated with a person's socioeconomic                status. Their clients usually did not have access to the Internet                because most were immigrants with low socioeconomic status. Intermediaries                described how children usually accessed the Internet at school,                looking up information for their parents when needed.               Intermediaries reported ongoing activities such as                providing technology centers where they train people how to use                the computer and the Internet. 21  They also donate refurbished computers                to people who finished the course so they could continue to practice                at home. In Hawaii, there is an ongoing effort to link all Hawaiian                homesteads by providing a computer for every Hawaiian family. 22  Also,                some community clinics such as the Wa'anae Coast Comprehensive Health                Center have Internet cafés for their patients.               Most of the time, intermediaries received phone calls                from community members asking them to locate health information                or services on their behalf. Although the Internet might be the                first source of information for intermediaries, most of the time                they were disappointed by the lack of quality translated materials.               Some intermediary organizations, especially those                that provide health care, developed their own health education materials,                translating Government or hospital materials into multiple Asian                American, Native Hawaiian, and other Pacific Islander languages.                When they received requests for health information materials in                these languages, they usually looked in-house and then to their                partner organizations before researching the Internet or library.               In partnership with Asian American, Native Hawaiian,                and other Pacific Islander organizations, libraries have experimented                with kiosks for print materials set up in grocery stores, temples,                and apartment complexes that are heavily populated by Asian communities.                One interviewee describes the problems they've experienced.                                We had one placed at a Vietnamese Buddhist temple,                  and when we went to do a site visit last year, the monks had placed                  the kiosk outside on the porch in the weather. We are supposed                  to have someone on staff there [where the kiosks are located]                  who will alert us if the paper kiosks are running low of materials.                  That's never happened. One person did mention that perhaps the                  Asian community is scared to take the brochures thinking they                  are going to be charged to pay for them.                 —Adela Calbillo, Texas Medical                  Center Library                             This library subsequently experienced greater success                with electronic kiosks in which an evaluation system recorded what                people were looking at, what language they were looking at, and                what they printed. Users were also given the opportunity to rate                the materials they find. To date, the results have been positive.               Despite these attempts to help the community access                the Internet, the intermediaries reported that the immigrant population                received health information primarily through word-of-mouth. 23                 Family members or friends read about a health issue in language                newspapers they receive either from overseas or from their local                community. They then talk about it over meals or during a haircut.               One intermediary discovered that language newspaper                reporters helped to perpetuate myths in their health news stories.                Reporters appeared to have interviewed community health center staff                members who were fluent in their native language and therefore usually                trained overseas. Unknowingly, these foreign-trained staff persons                tell reporters false health facts, which were then printed in the                very newspapers on which the community relied for health information.                             Perceptions of Health                The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, in partnership with                the Asian Pacific Islander American Health Forum, conducted focus                groups and key informant interviews with Cambodians, Filipinos,                Native Hawaiians, and Vietnamese Americans. 24  The Vietnamese community                believes that good health means living without pain and being emotionally                stable. Health is a blessing from God, and people often meditate,                practice yoga, or pray to maintain a healthy mind and body. The                Filipino community believes that good health is achieved through                balance among mental, emotional, and physical states of mind. 25                                They don't talk about health issues because these                  issues are personal and private. They believe if you have good                  karma then you have good health. If you are afflicted with cervical                  cancer, then that means you must have been a bad woman, not in                  this life but in previous lives.                 —Dr. Thang Nguyen, Boat People                  SOS                 I'll give one example in the treatment of high blood                  pressure. A health care provider must be aware that health is                  often perceived of as an absence of pain in the Asian culture.                  Therefore, from the perspective of an Asian patient who has high                  blood pressure, the patient may think that they were completely                  healthy, until they saw the doctor who made them sick by starting                  them on medicines and giving them a diagnosis.                 —Dr. Ming-Hui Chen, Former Medical                  Director,                  South Cove Community Health Center                             Most immigrants believe in myths they learned in their                home country. For example, people from China believe that children                inherit hepatitis B from their mothers and that the disease is transmitted                through food and water. Neither of these myths is true: children                have a 95 percent chance of developing immunity to hepatitis B through                vaccination at birth and the disease is transmitted through blood                and sexual fluids only. Focus groups and surveys conducted in several                hepatitis B outreach programs around the Nation have demonstrated                that these myths are widely believed in the Asian American, Native                Hawaiian, and other Pacific Islander community. 26               Native Hawaiians base their concepts of health and                wellness on relationships with natural elements, natural environments,                specific places, other living things, and people. These relationships                form the Hawaiian concept of  ola , built upon a strong spiritual                foundation. Traditional Hawaiian healing practices are a central                part of Native Hawaiian life. They include both physical and mental                health interventions. 27                                           Goal 2:  To identify tasks that                intermediaries of Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and other Pacific                Islander communities want to accomplish on a health information                Web site.               To achieve this goal, ODPHP collected 32 tasks identified                by 42 intermediaries who responded to the letter from the White                House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. Through                an online comment form, 66 intermediaries subsequently ranked these                32 tasks on a scale of 0 to 3, with 0 being that they would never                try to accomplish this task on a health information Web site and                3 being that they always will try to accomplish this task on a health                information Web site.                The top three tasks identified by 14 executive                directors were:                                                  1.

Among the most significant tasks, from the perspectives                of all Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and other Pacific Islander                intermediaries, were the following:                               Find information on disease or condition.                 Search for statistics.                 Find information on health specific to communities.                 Find journal articles.

Appendix C  provides specific                information on users and their tasks.                                 Goal 3:  To understand how Federal                agencies can best serve Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and other                Pacific Islander communities in the area of health education materials.                               Identify preferences for existing online translated                  materials.                 Identify preferences for creating translated materials.                 Identify preferences for visual displays of information.                             Preferences for Existing Online Language Materials                 Most intermediaries spoke with great passion                about the difficulties they encountered with language materials.                First, quality online translated materials are scarce. Second, even                quality online translated materials may not be accessible to many                potential users.                                  There is a quality issue and effectiveness issue.                  Federal agencies usually hire contractors who translate materials                  at a Ph.D. level and who are not familiar with the audience for                  consumer education materials. It would be more effective and might                  also cost less to hire a community based organization that has                  knowledge about effective messages, cultural beliefs and commonly                  used terminology. I have seen federal agencies spend resources                  to print and disseminate materials where the accents are printed                  alongside instead of above the characters. This is frustrating                  for both the federal agency who is attempting to do the right                  thing and it perpetuates the notion that federal agencies and                  programs are not culturally and linguistically competent. Many                  member community based organizations can't access PDF materials.                  We have to fax things to them.                 —Lisa Hasegawa, National Coalition                  for Asian Pacific                  American Community Development                             Intermediaries suggested providing several options                such as PDF files, graphics, or entire translated Web sites that                require browsers with the language plug-in. They also preferred                bilingual materials because the English version of the material                can become separated from the translated materials. Community health                centers especially experienced this problem as newly hired staff                may continue to distribute translated materials provided by their                predecessor, without knowing where the materials originally came                from or what they say.                                One of the things we do at AAPCHO is create health                  education materials that are bilingual—both in English and                  the client's language. One reason we do this is because let's                  say someone e-mailed me a link to this Vietnamese hepatitis B                  material—or even worse, someone printed it out and handed                  it to me or our patients. I can't read Vietnamese so I wouldn't                  know what the material says, how reliable it is, or where it came                  from. If the resource is bilingual, then we don't have to worry                  about the English and in-language text being separated.                 —Jeff Caballero, Association                  of Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations                             Preferences for Creating Translated                Materials                To address the lack of quality translated materials, many intermediaries                create their own translated materials. Usually, they try to locate                quality English content to translate into Asian American, Native                Hawaiian, and other Pacific Islander languages. The process is slow                because a number of problems surface during the translation process.                                There is no standard lexicon for health words. It                  is extremely difficult to translate, since everyone translates                  differently. A term like ""AIDS"" has no standard or comparable                  or competent translation in Vietnamese. They have no concept for                  ""hepatitis B."" Sometimes it is translated as ""swollen liver.""                 —Dr. Thang Nguyen, Boat People                  SOS                             In addition, standards and processes are lacking.                Organizations have developed their own guidelines or process for                translating materials. The strategies vary from beginning with an                original English-language document to beginning with an original                Asian American-, Native Hawaiian-, or other Pacific Islander-language                document or from conducting focus groups with community members                to establishing expert review teams with intermediaries.               Preferences for Visual Displays                of Information                One question asked in the White House Initiative letter was ""What                symbols or phrases suggest health and well-being to you?"" Out of                42 respondents, the top suggestions were nature, nutrition, exercise,                happiness, and balance.               During our one-on-one interviews, ODPHP tested two                brochure concepts developed based on the 42 comments we received                from the White House Initiative letter. One brochure contained nature                scenes, and the other featured photographs of Asian American, Native                Hawaiian, and other Pacific Islander faces. We showed these brochures                to the interviewees interviewed locally only. Most interviewees                preferred images of faces combined with images of scenes where interviewees                are working with community members, such as teaching them how to                use the computer or passing out fliers at health fairs. Interviewees                noted that too few stock photos of Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians,                and other Pacific Islanders are available on the market; therefore,                unfortunately, the respondents see the same stock photos all the                time. They also talked about how stock photos sometimes depict these                communities as ""too perfect"" or looking like ""movie stars.""                In addition to the print materials, ODPHP tested the                use of graphics on the Web site. On our prototype, the graphic on                the Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and other Pacific Islander                main page was an animated sequence of Asian artwork symbolizing                health and longevity, donated by the Smithsonian Institution (see                 figure 2 ). Most interviewees who were born outside of the United                States enjoyed the artwork, saying it was a nice touch and culturally                appropriate. The Hawaiians preferred seeing Native Hawaiian crafts.                                                           Figure 2: Images donated from                Freer and Sackler Art Gallery, Smithsonian Institution                               However, the images produced negative reactions from                many who could not relate to the artwork:                                I don't see the relevance. Are we feeding into stereotypes?                  Is this the way the American society views Asian Americans and                  Pacific Islanders?                 —Dr. Butch de Castro, American                  Public Health Association's                  Asian Pacific Islander Caucus                             Interviewees also took the opportunity to discuss                the importance of using photographs of everyday Asian American,                Native Hawaiian, and other Pacific Islander life in American society,                instead of photographs of community members in their native dress                or native countries.                                           Goal 4:  To investigate the overall                usability of healthfinder®.                During our interviews, ODPHP asked participants to                accomplish specific tasks. We noted the decisions and choices interviewees                made as they tried to perform efficiently. We were specifically                interested in ascertaining the following information:                               Identify differences between users' expressed preferences                  for seeking health information and their actual performance.                 Explore users' patterns for searching for and filtering                  information.                             Expressed Preferences Versus Actual                Performance              ODPHP asked users to begin on the ""Just For You"" main                page as this is the main entry point we are promoting to special                populations (see  figure 3 ). When users were                asked to perform a task on the ""Just For You"" page of healthfinder®,                52 percent used the search bar, whereas 41 percent of users selected                the Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and other Pacific Islander                link. The remainder selected another link on the page.                                                             Figure 3: Screen capture                of  http://www.healthfinder.gov/justforyou                                            A majority of interviewees were pleased to see a link                for ""Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders"" as                opposed to ""Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders."" However, Hawaiian                and other Pacific Islander interviewees suggested that it would                still be best to disaggregate Native Hawaiians from Pacific Islanders,                as well as from Asian Americans.                                 It would be no different if we were lumped with                  Native Americans or any other ethnic group. The problem would                  be that we still would have the difficulty as far as interpreting                  what in fact are the data that relate to our communities.                 —Robert Uhrle, Advocate Initiatives                  for Grassroots Access                 If people are really honed in to their ethnicity,                  then you need to be able to pop up their ethnic related stuff                  quickly. They shouldn't have to jump through hoops to get to it.                  For instance, if I want to know what material you have about Native                  Hawaiians, show me all health-related materials you have about                  Native Hawaiians. I don't want to know about Pacific Islanders.                  I don't want to know about Asian Americans. I don't want to jump                  through groups to get to Native Hawaiians.                 —Gerald Ohta, Hawaii Department                  of Health                             Despite the concern expressed around aggregating information                for the populations, none of the intermediaries had a problem completing                the task of locating translated materials on hepatitis B. The average                time to complete the task was less than a minute. Those who had                some difficulty locating the translated materials pointed out that                the ""Also available in"" link was not visible to their eye because                they were focused on scanning through the abstract information.                They usually saw the ""Also available in: Spanish"" link because the                link appeared much shorter and noticeable when only one language                was listed. They noted that ""Spanish"" should not be displayed in                the Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and other Pacific Islander                section. Others did not see the ""Traditional—Chinese"" or ""Simplified—Chinese""                link because they were scanning for the letter ""C"" for ""Chinese""                (see  figure 4 ).                                                                                         Figure 4: Screen capture of how translated                  materials display                                           The majority of interviewees did not notice the ""see                categories and related topics"" link (see  figure                4 ). Some suggested that the italics made the link less noticeable.                However, all the interviewees were very pleased with the choices                on the ""see categories and related topics"" page (see                 figure 5 ).                                                                          Figure 5: Screen capture                of ""categories and related topics"" page                             Interviewees were most interested in the list of languages,                the ""organizations"" link, and the ""statistics"" link. They would                prefer seeing these choices up front on the Asian Americans, Native                Hawaiians, and other Pacific Islanders main page. The ""general""                link caused some confusion as users were unsure what to expect if                they selected it. They also expressed a preference for the list                of choices to be in alphabetical order.               The title of ""show resources"" and the list of languages                created some confusion. Users expected the whole site to be in the                language they selected. Upon selecting a language, most users said,                ""Oh, I got the same result as before""?—meaning that they automatically                assumed they were seeing the page with all hepatitis B results for                Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and other Pacific Islanders ( figure                4 ) instead of just hepatitis B results that had translated materials                for the selected language.                                I do like the ability to click on a language. However,                  if someone speaks or reads only Chinese, they would not necessarily                  be able to read the English word ""Chinese."" [User selects Chinese                  link.] But I see now that what it does is actually provide you                  documents that are in the language you choose. I wish it came                  earlier because I would never have thought to click on ""see categories                  and related topics."" If I clicked on ""Asian American, Native Hawaiian,                  and other Pacific Islanders,"" I think it would have been useful                  to immediately have the top documents filtered by language.                  —Angelo Locsin, National Asian                  Pacific Center on Aging                             Another page that users had trouble with was the ""directory                of healthfinder® organizations"" (see  figure                6 ). Before seeing this page, users expressed preferences for                viewing Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and other Pacific Islander                organizations.                                                                          Figure 6: Screen capture                of  www.healthfinder.gov/organization                             After using the page, users were confused by the interface.                They expected the A-Z list to be the first letter of the names of                organizations—for example, ""A"" for ""Asian Pacific Islander                American Health Forum."" Interviewees were all surprised to find                that the A-Z list was actually a list of health topics. Some thought                they had arrived at the same list they saw earlier in other parts                of the site. They expressed a desire to see all organizations and                be able to browse through them alphabetically or find organizations                grouped by the communities they serve.               Explore User's Patterns for                Searching for and Filtering Information                None of the 30 interviewees independently used the advanced search.                When they were asked to view the advanced search page, some users                were confused by the two search boxes appearing on the page. Others                had trouble with the meaning of the titles and the drop-down menu                choices (see  figure 7 ). The choices available                for ""search within"" were especially confusing. Users wanted to know                why you could select ""documents"" and ""organizations"" together—""Documents                & Organizations""—but not all three—""news, documents, and                organizations."" Also, some were confused about the difference between                documents and organizations.                                Search within documents, within organizations .                  . . what organization here, I'm not very clear about this. What                  organization are you talking about? Is it U.S. Department of Health                  and Human Services? Sort results by title. Okay, but is it title                  of documents or title of organization? Minor category: dictionaries                  are very good I think, especially to have medical dictionary for                  Chinese to English or English to Chinese. What is Metasite?

For ""population group,""                some Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders expressed a preference                for being able to select ""Native Hawaiians"" or ""Pacific Islanders""                only.                              Following suggestions from our previous American Indian                and Alaska Native evaluation, we added a search within the Asian                American, Native Hawaiian, and other Pacific Islander section. None                of the interviewees used the search text box that was specifically                for searching within this section (see  figure                1 ). Some complained that they did not see it because it was                below the fold. Others thought that the search text box at the top                and the one for the Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and other Pacific                Islander section were identical. Part of the problem was that the                instructions for using the A-Z list were underneath the search text                box, so people were associating the instructions to the search text                box. However, once they knew about this feature, they were all glad                it was available.

Most respondents were very pleased that ODPHP was                conducting these interviews and consulting with community groups.                They were especially pleased to learn of a central location where                they can go for translated materials.                                This is fantastic. This is good.

We have an Internet                  café with three or four computers at our health center. So if                  we can get information out on where to access the information                  that you have, it would be really helpful because it [healthfinder®]                  does have really good information.                 —Kauila Clark, Wai'anae Coast                  Comprehensive Health Center                 Just try to get some more resources, some more sites.

They can just go right to a certain site for specific information                  and that's good. I like this site.

MultiLingual-Health-Education.net                (MLHEN), developed in Canada, identified the need for a coordinated                effort to address translation needs in 1995. The project gathered                all the health-related translated materials used by the 22 health                care agencies involved in the partnership. MLHEN's translated materials                are designed for the general public to use with the help of health                care professionals, particularly in multicultural settings where                translations of quick and reliable health-related information are                needed. (See  http://www.multilingual-health-education.net .)                             The Multicultural Health Communication Service, developed                in Australia, provides information and services to help health professionals                communicate with non-English-speaking communities throughout New                South Wales. This organization has more than 450 publications available                in a wide variety of languages. (See  http://mhcs.health.nsw.gov.au/health-public-affairs/mhcs/index.html .)               The main concern expressed by intermediaries is the                disaggregation of Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders from                Asian Americans. However, most agreed that we had to start somewhere.                It was better to include Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders                than not have any resources for them.                                You have to start somewhere, right? If I'm an intermediary                  and thinking what I need most is to find out where do I go for                  help or if I have a client that I'm trying to find information                  for, then I can come here.                 —Hardy Spoehr, Papa Ola Lakahi                             In terms of content, the top health topics requested                were traditional healing, diabetes, mental health, HIV/AIDS, cardiovascular                disease, cancer, access to care, hepatitis B and C, nutrition, and                tuberculosis. For Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, obesity                and hypertension were additional topics of importance. One intermediary                described how important it was in his work to find or provide information                on traditional healing.                                If you have a cold or a very low fever, especially                  with a cold and coughing, they rub your skin with a coin. They                  call it ""coining"" in English because they sometimes use a quarter                  and some special oil and they pretty much rub your skin. They                  leave big bruises on your skin and they believe it heals . . .                  and it does heal the cold. We have hundreds of calls from schools                  because children go back to school after having a cold with very                  large bruises on their neck or their back. It looks like they                  have been beaten up by their parents. I think for the past 10                  years, we have been slowly educating ourselves and the schools                  that this is a form of traditional healing among the Southeast                  Asian families.                 —Vaka Faletau, County of Los                  Angeles, Asian Pacific Project                             Back to Table of Contents                                                                                           Section 6 - Recommendations                                                                         Recommendations Regarding Translated                        Materials                     Recommendations Regarding the Use of Visuals                     Recommendations Concerning Usability                     Recommendations for AANHOPI Online Health Information                                          This section provides general recommendations based on                the research results. Recommendations specific to healthfinder®                are not included.               Recommendations Regarding Translated Materials              Intermediaries recommended that Federal agencies develop                a lexicon or glossary of terms for health words for each Asian American,                Native Hawaiian, and other Pacific Islander language. In addition,                Federal agencies should provide guidelines, standards, or a process                for creating quality online translated materials.                                 Think through what you are translating. Often times                  there are Web sites or phone numbers that are translated. If you                  are going to translate it, think through how people will respond.                  They will call this number or go to this Web site. But what if                  the Web site is only in English and the 1-800 number is only answered                  by an English-speaking person? If you have language capacity,                  say so. If you don't, you could add that callers will need an                  English speaker to call for them. I think there is often an assumption                  that you can just take the English piece and just automatically                  translate. But you actually need to go through and think about                  if you were in a non-English reader's shoes and looking at this.                  What would I end up experiencing?                 It is important to do focus group testing even before                  the messages are developed, preferably in the native language.                  Being able to get that input before you start is important because                  I think it's often difficult once you already have it set in English                  to expect the translated version is going to automatically work                  with the target community. If possible, focus group test the materials                  after they have been translated. So basically, get the folks that                  are supposed to be benefiting from these materials involved with                  the materials development. Find out if your messages make sense                  and if your information addresses the needs of the community you're                  trying to reach.                 If you are working with translators, you want to be                  able to develop your own lexicon or glossary. Otherwise, different                  translators will come up with their own translations for terms                  and concepts that don't have a standard translation. Different                  documents with different translations can end up defeating your                  purpose by confusing your readers.                 Then another practical thing is just to recognize that                  there is an expansion of text when it comes to translation. Folks                  need to think about expanding the format or cutting out some information                  instead of just making the font size smaller.                 —Linda Okahara, Asian Health Services                             The following three resources offer examples of guidelines,                standards, and translation services used by other organizations:                               NSW Multicultural Health Communication Service in Australia                  offers translation guidelines and checklists. (See  http://mhcs.health.nsw.gov.au/health-public-affairs/mhcs/index.html ).                 The Minnesota Department of Health developed the  Translation                  Protocol: A Guide to Translating Materials for Limited English-speaking                  Communities , 28  which covers checklists,                  examples of translations that have gone wrong, lists of qualified                  translation agencies, and how to find a qualified translator.                  (See  http://www.health.state.mn.us/communityeng/multicultural/translation.pdf ).                 The Interagency Working Group on Limited English Proficiency                  offers a clearinghouse of information, tools, and technical assistance                  for Federal agencies, recipients of Federal funds, and community-based                  organizations and individuals regarding meaningful language access                  to Federal and federally assisted programs and activities. (See                   www.lep.gov ).                             The following examples, taken from the Minnesota Department                of Health's  Translation Protocol , offer a humorous look at                translations gone awry, while underscoring the importance of accurate                translation.                               The name Coca-Cola in China was first rendered as Ke-kou-ke-la.                  Unfortunately, the Coke company did not discover until after thousands                  of signs had been printed that the phrase means ""bite the wax                  tadpole"" or ""female horse stuffed with wax"" depending on the dialect.                  Coke then researched 40,000 Chinese characters and found a close                  phonetic equivalent, ""ko-kou-ko-le,"" which can be loosely translated                  as ""Happiness in the mouth.""                  In Taiwan, the translation of the Pepsi slogan ""Come alive with                  the Pepsi Generation"" came out as ""Pepsi will bring your ancestors                  back from the dead.""                  Also in Chinese, the Kentucky Fried Chicken slogan ""finger-lickin'                  good"" came out as ""eat your fingers off.""                  The American slogan for Salem cigarettes, ""Salem?—Feeling                  Free,"" got translated in the Japanese market into ""When smoking                  Salem, you feel so refreshed that your mind seems to be free and                  empty.""                             For online translated materials, interviewees recommended                providing users several options, ranging from PDFs to graphical                displays to entire Web sites that require a language plug-in for                browsers. Intermediaries also suggested developing bilingual materials                to prevent English-language documents from being separated from                their translations.               Recommendations Regarding the Use of Visuals                For the Web site or printed materials, intermediaries recommended                using photographs of Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and other                Pacific Islanders living in America. Many confided that they would                rather throw away than distribute free materials that they felt                were inappropriate for their community. Interviewees suggested that                agencies either contract with Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and                other Pacific Islander intermediary organizations to produce their                materials or contact them for photographs or graphics. They were                very pleased that ODPHP asked for their opinion and review prior                to finalizing and printing materials. In addition, intermediaries                recommended translating quality audiovisual materials for their                communities.                                I'd like to see some collaborative effort to take quality patient                  education materials that are audiovisuals and translate them for                  nonreading or nonliterate people, especially for cultural groups                  that are immigrants. It's nice if we could have something that                  can be played back on a computer screen and even distributed on                  CD-ROMs as well so that they could be distributed. I've just heard                  over and over again that pictures are really important. The overall                  health literacy issue is such that the reading level and pictures                  of patient education materials needs to be brought down to what                  people can use.                 —Margaret Allen, Hmong Health Information Promotion Project                        Recommendations Concerning Usability               Some general usability issues that suggested a need for further testing, as demonstrated by the following concerns expressed by intermediaries:                               Some users were inexperienced or annoyed with PDF files.  Users need to be warned that a link will open a PDF file.                 Some users did not have a language plug-in installed                  for their browser. Users need to be warned that they need a plug-in                  to view the site properly.                 Many users desire more choices for sorting the information presented.                 Some labels or links were not descriptive enough to match user expectations.        Providing more instructional content on sites would help users determine where to go to get the specific information they are seeking.                        Recommendations for Asian American, Native                Hawaiian, and Other Pacific Islander Online Health Information                 Intermediaries recommended that the next phase                of the project address the following user preferences:    Disaggregate Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders from Asian Americans at the very least.  The best scenario would be to have a separate section for each of these three groups.   Review the quality of the translated materials that the site links to.  Many interviewees would like to know how the materials are rated or reviewed.   Provide access to local organizations.  Most intermediaries get calls from community members wanting to know how to access health services in their area.      I do get calls from around the country like, ""do you know of anything in St. Paul?""  And if I can't find it pretty easily on the Internet, then I'll just tell them to call the health department over there only if I know someone there.   —Gem Daus, Asian and Pacific Islander American Health Forum                  Local resources?—If that is possible, that would be superb.                  So if I lived in Chicago, I would know where to go in Chicago                  for culturally competent mental health treatment or services.                  It would be nice to know which organizations are service providers.   —Dr. DJ Ida, National Asian American Pacific Islander   Mental Health Association          Back to Table of Contents                                                                                                  Section 7 - Conclusion                                            For the purpose of designing cultural usability, we will keep the definition simple and operational.  We will view culture in terms of attributes belonging to a target audience that distinguish it from other target communities.  Therefore, we view culture as the collective of identifiable behaviors, practices, conventions, signs, symbols, artifacts, values, and beliefs that characterize a group.  The practice of cultural usability requires that the designer identify the target audience's relevant attributes and design accordingly for them.                 —Albert N. Badre 1                  ODPHP studied ""cultural usability"" as defined by Badre for 2 of                the 15 special population sections of  www.healthfinder.gov :                  American Indians and Alaska Natives    Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and other Pacific Islanders.                        In our investigation of Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and other Pacific Islander populations, ODPHP gathered significant information about various audiences, attributes of health information that are important to these audiences, and their reasons for visiting health-related Web sites.                   ODPHP validated the approach of an English searchable database for intermediaries of Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and other Pacific Islander populations.  They were interested to learn there is a central location where they can go for quality translated materials.  They shared with ODPHP their frustrations about the lack of such materials.  Intermediaries recommended that Federal agencies consider developing a health or medical lexicon or glossary as well as standards or procedures for translating materials.                     As more materials are collected for these audiences, intermediaries suggested that separating Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and other Pacific Islanders into three distinct categories ultimately provide the best service to each of these communities.          The tools presented in  appendix                B  and  appendix C  are designed to be                building blocks or foundations for better understanding what Asian                American, Native Hawaiian, and other Pacific Islander intermediaries                want to accomplish on healthfinder® and other health information                Web sites.

It was established in 1984 by the Department of Family Practice     and Community Health at the University of Minnesota Medical School. The UCare provider     network has grown to include 468 primary care clinics, 125 hospitals, and 10,000     providers. Ucare Minnesota is now the fourth-largest HMO in Minnesota.            Program Development and Implementation     Overview     The success of UCare Minnesota's Breastfeeding Promotion Program is based on the development of strong community partnerships with state and local public health agencies, as well as implementation of health plan policies to provide support for mothers who breastfeed. The health plan has demonstrated a strong commitment to community support for breastfeeding by funding new and existing breastfeeding promotion efforts. In addition, policy changes to increase access to breastfeeding education, lactation support, and breast pumps demonstrate the health plan's dedication to breastfeeding support and encouragement among its membership. Through this strategy, UCare Minnesota continues to increase awareness of the benefits of breastfeeding, support mothers who choose to breastfeed, and promote social support for breastfeeding in the community.     Background     In 1996, Ross Labs' National Mothers Survey indicated that only 67.4% of Minnesota mothers breastfed their infants in the hospital; the breastfeeding rate decreased to 23.5% at six months after birth. In response to these startling findings, the Minnesota Department of Health included two breastfeeding-related objectives in its Public Health Improvement Goals for 2004:         Increase the proportion of mothers who breastfeed     their babies in the early postpartum period to at least 75%; and          Increase the proportion of mothers who continue     breastfeeding until their babies are aged five to six months to at least 50%.           UCare Minnesota was already aware of the mounting evidence indicating the multiple health and economic benefits of breastfeeding for infants, mothers, and society. The health plan also realized that breastfeeding rates were lowest among low-income populations, younger mothers, recent immigrants, and some minority populations.     Beginning in July 1998, UCare took a proactive approach to encouraging breastfeeding within its membership and the community as a whole by initiating the ""Breastfeeding Promotion Program."" That same year, UCare partnered with the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) on its ""Loving Support Makes Breastfeeding Work"" campaign and met with representatives of other local public health organizations to discuss strategies for collaboration. UCare Minnesota's resulting initiative provided financial support to build on programs implemented by partner agencies, and also included health plan-specific interventions, including prenatal education and breastfeeding promotion; postpartum assessment and follow-up care; and improved access to breast pumps.     Target Population     It is UCare Minnesota's belief that community support for breastfeeding will increase initiation and maintenance rates overall. For this reason, the educational components of the health plan's Breastfeeding Promotion Program are targeted to all Minnesota residents, with particular emphasis on pregnant Medicaid enrollees and their families. UCare has also provided funding for a breastfeeding intervention targeted specifically to the Hmong population in Minnesota.     Goals     The goal of UCare Minnesota's Breastfeeding Promotion Program is to promote breastfeeding among members through increased awareness of the benefits of breastfeeding, improved access to breast pumps as needed, and promotion of social support for breastfeeding mothers.     Essential Program Elements     With the realization of the positive benefits of breastfeeding and the MDH's emphasis on breastfeeding promotion, UCare Minnesota sought ways to incorporate breastfeeding education and promotion into existing member services, as well as strategies to contribute to other public health agencies' efforts.     Member Services         Prenatal Breastfeeding Education. The health plan has     added breastfeeding information to the prenatal packets sent to all pregnant members.     These materials include a pamphlet describing the benefits of breastfeeding, as well as an     easy-to-understand guide to getting started. Both documents are written in simple     conversational language to ensure comprehension. Subsequently, all pregnant women receive     a call once a trimester and postpartum from a health information company contracted by     UCare to ensure that members have received the information sent and to identify any     potential problems. To encourage enrollee attendance at childbirth and pregnancy education     classes, including classes on breastfeeding, UCare designed an incentive program that     makes mothers eligible for gift certificates by attending all the classes.          Postpartum Support. After birth, UCare Minnesota     continues promoting breastfeeding within its membership by reimbursing universal home     visits for all mothers after delivery to address any concerns, including breastfeeding.     The health plan has established a full-time maternity case manager position to handle all     high-risk births and problem pregnancies. This case manager can arrange for referral to a     lactation consultant if necessary (a service reimbursed by UCare Minnesota). The health     plan also includes articles about breastfeeding in the member newsletter, distributes new     parent information packets that encourage breastfeeding, and refers parents to a 24-hour     medical resource telephone line for more breastfeeding information.          Breast Pumps. In 1997, UCare Minnesota contributed     several hundred dollars to the Ramsey County WIC program to increase their stock of foot     pedal breast pumps. In addition, effective July 1998, UCare expanded its policy on breast     pumps to allow full coverage of pumps less than $250 without prior authorization (only a     physician's order is required). When medically necessary, pump rental over $250 can be     authorized.           Community Partnerships         Social Support. UCare Minnesota prides itself on its     willingness and ability to collaborate with state and local agencies to provide needed     services for enrollees. An assessment by the Minnesota Institute of Public Health, for the     Minnesota WIC program in the 1990s showed that reasons for not breastfeeding included lack     of medical and familial support, inconvenience, and embarrassment. The WIC program decided     a strategy to promote community acceptance of, and support for, breastfeeding was an     important component in encouraging more women to breastfeed and developing a community     that would support both the initiation and continuation of this healthy feeding option.          The United States Department of Agriculture, Food and     Consumer Service also recognized the need for developing community support for     breastfeeding. This recognition lead to development of the WIC National Breastfeeding     Promotion Project via a cooperative agreement with Best Start Social Marketing. The     ""Loving Support"" campaign was unveiled and welcomed in 1997. While USDA     supported development of the campaign, individual states needed to fund program rollout.     The Minnesota WIC Program purchased pamphlets, posters, and Loving Support Kits for use in     WIC clinics, promoted the campaign to other organizations, and encouraged purchase and use     of the materials within their organizations. WIC also purchased Loving Support vinyl     banners, which were shared with other organizations via the Minnesota Department of Health     library. No funds were available to implement the media component of the campaign. MDH     obtained $10,000 from the MCH block grant and challenged other organizations to match this     amount. Ucare Minnesota stepped forward as the only health plan to contribute to the     initiative by donating $10,000 to the ""Loving Support Makes Breastfeeding Work""     campaign in 1998.           These funds, combined with matching funds by WIC and generous public service contributions, allowed the purchase of 25 billboards placed throughout Minnesota in 1999; four vinyl bulletins rotated throughout the Minneapolis/St. Paul area for the year 2000; the purchase of additional banners for display in public health arenas; purchase of posters for distribution to community members and providers; and purchase of television and radio spots which were made available to individual communities if they could obtain placement for the spots. Materials depict families of various ethnicity and proclaim, ""Give a breastfeeding mom your loving support."" The number 1-877-214- BABY is included on all materials for mass media. Callers to this line can obtain phone numbers for sources of breastfeeding support in their communities.         Hmong Intervention. In 1997-1998, UCare Minnesota financially     supported a breastfeeding promotion project for Hmong women with the St. Paul/Ramsey     County Department of Public Health. The project interviewed Hmong women at the     Refugee/Preventive Medicine Clinic to identify barriers to breastfeeding and implemented     interventions to encourage Hmong women to breastfeed. One-on-one interviews with refugees     demonstrated that barriers to breastfeeding, such as lack of information, language     barriers, lack of adequate time with hospital staff, easy access to formula through     hospitals and WIC programs, limited reimbursement for home visits, and social and     environmental barriers, existed within the female Hmong population. Hmong cultural beliefs     also presented a unique challenge.       With these barriers in mind, the clinic staff designed several key interventions to improve breastfeeding rates among the Hmong women. Strategies such as one-on-one counseling and education from a respected community member, inclusion of family members, and brief daily home visits from a public health nurse allowed staff to build trust with clients through shared dialogue and provided counseling for mothers and families. In addition, culturally-specific educational materials were distributed.     Evaluation and Outcomes     In 1999, UCare Minnesota reached out to over 1,700 pregnant enrollees by providing breastfeeding brochures in all prenatal packets. Through the health plan's expanded breast pump payment policy, 336 women received breast pumps free of charge in 1999. This number is nearly three times the number of pumps distributed in 1997, prior to the policy change in July 1998. As the project with Hmong women has continued, it has resulted in a breastfeeding rate increase from 42% in January 1998 to 60% in December 2000.     Cost     By collaborating with state and local public health agencies to financially support existing efforts, the health plan is able to monitor expenditures. There are minimal costs associated with communicating the revised breast pump reimbursement policy to providers and with mailing educational materials to enrollees.     Lessons Learned     According to health plan staff, many aspects of UCare Minnesota's Breastfeeding Promotion Program are highly replicable. Through development of partnerships and collaborations with state and local agencies such as WIC, the health plan has been able to effectively build on existing efforts and incorporate specific breastfeeding promotion strategies into its own benefits structure. Coordination of health plan efforts with such groups is essential to creating a synergistic improvement in overall community breastfeeding rates. In addition, UCare Minnesota's involvement with the Minnesota Department of Health demonstrates the importance for all levels of the community to consistently voice support and encouragement for women to breastfeed. Likewise, member education efforts can easily be replicated by other health plans, although resources for development and dissemination are necessary.     Directions for the Future     UCare Minnesota is committed to continuing its partnerships that support breastfeeding among members and to continually educating members and providers about the essential components to successful breastfeeding.

Nearly half are of Southeast Asian origin,             including Cambodians (Khmer) (20%), Laotians (14%), Hmong (5%) and             Vietnamese (4%).           About 93% of Asian Americans in Rhode Island             live in urban areas such as Cranston, Providence, and Woonsocket.           About 84% of Asians over age 5 speak a language             at home other than English, including Khmer (Cambodian), Vietnamese,             Hmong, and Laotian. Many elderly Khmer cannot read or write their             own language.           Asians are almost 4 times as likely to live in             poverty as the general population (26.5% vs. 6.8%). This also means             that almost three quarters of Asians in RI do  not  live in             poverty.           The median family income for Asians in RI is             about 71% that of all RI families.           Only 60% of Asians 25 and older in the state             have received a high school diploma, compared to 72% of the general             population.           From 1975-1979, well-educated professionals             escaped from Cambodia on their own, and after brief stays in Thai             refugee camps were resettled in the US and Canada.           From 1980-1985, well-educated Cambodians             continued to resettle, and larger numbers of rural agrarian families             arrived in the US. Many were widows and orphans due to brutal civil             war. A large percentage lacked the skills necessary to live in the             US. Since 1985, family members who are now American citizens have             sponsored most immigrants.           Some believe that there are hundreds of             Cambodians in Cranston who were not counted in the 1990 census.                   return to         top                                           Names                         Naming is an important undertaking. Elders,             temple monks, and other learned persons are consulted for a baby’s             name, especially if it is a boy.             In most Asian communities, the woman does not             change her name when she marries but is formally addressed with her             husband’s surname.             Within Hmong society, the estimated number of             clans varies from 18 to 25. Each clan is distinguished by its last             name – Yang, Vang, Xiong, Hang, Moua, etc.             Hmong are not allowed to marry someone with the             same last name in the same clan organization.                         Family Structures                         The family is generally valued over the             individual.             Family structures vary between different Asian             cultures. Many maintain the tradition of raising large families.             The spokesperson of the family is the father or             the eldest child. Traditional gender roles are strong, but men help             with domestic chores and child rearing. The mother, father, or both             may be the authority figures and decision-makers in the household,             but in most Asian cultures, it is the husband who assumes these             roles. Elders play a key role in decision-making, while wives             ""convince"" their husbands about decisions. When elders are             present, however, they assume positions of authority above both             parents.             Among Khmer, due to many losses in war,             non-biological relatives may be considered as kin. Three generations             frequently live in the same house.             Many Southeast Asians practice various forms of             Buddhism or a blend of Buddhism, Animism, and Christianity.             Language barriers and other differences             resulting from immigration can create family tension between elders             and their children.             Bringing honor to the family is highly valued.                   return to         top                                                 Communication and Social Interaction                         Informality in addressing people is considered             a form of disrespect.             Avoiding eye contact is generally deemed a sign             of respect.             Khmer people are shy but affectionate to one             another and have a small personal space. It is considered impolite             to disagree. Many may  say   yes, but not  do   as             expected.             Sensitive issues, such as sexuality, should             include a translator of the same gender.             A common Khmer greeting, called the  sompeah ,             is to bring the palms together with fingers pointing upward. The             height of the gesture indicates the status of the individual being             greeted. Khmer who are more acculturated to American culture may             greet with handshakes. A quiet tone of voice is used, and politeness             is important.             Touching a Khmer person’s head without             permission is considered disrespectful, because some believe the             soul resides in the head.             Silence is welcomed among the Khmer and is more             appropriate than meaningless chatter.             Public displays of affection and public contact             between members of the opposite sex are considered inappropriate,             whereas hand holding between members of the same sex is deemed a             sign of friendship.             Written consents for the older Khmer population             may cause discomfort, due to the fact that during the Khmer Rouge             war, signed life histories were required from those later executed.             Saving face is important, as is a respect for             authority figures. The Khmer are hesitant when discussing sexuality,             mental health symptoms, and alternative healing practices.             Sparing one’s feelings is considered more             important than factual truth. To avoid confrontation or disrespect,             many will not verbalize disagreement. Instead they may avoid             answering a question.             A smile should not be interpreted as happiness             or agreement among Southeast Asians. Individuals may laugh in a             situation that is, to Westerners, inappropriate. It is not             necessarily a sign of ridicule or berating, but perhaps nervousness.             Speaking in a loud tone with excessive gestures             is considered rude in many Southeast Asian cultures ,               especially when done by women.                   return to         top                                                 Time Orientation                         May tend to arrive early for appointments. But             the Khmer who have a flexible attitude toward time may be late.             There is an emphasis on the past and remembering ancestors, but also             on the present, because actions today will determine the future.             Since the Khmer are predominantly Buddhist, they believe in rebirth.                         Health Beliefs and Practices                         Among traditional Southeast Asians, treatment             is centered on a family approach that accounts for ancestors and             descendants, rather than the individual. The importance of             face-saving and limiting confrontation should be acknowledged.             Organizing groups by gender and cultural subgroups may be helpful.             Health education should be incorporated into ongoing activities like             work/vocational training.             Health beliefs revolve around the Yin-Yang             philosophy (balance). Yin illnesses are considered cold and should             be treated with Yang, hot foods (e.g., chicken). Yang illnesses are             deemed to be hot and should be treated with Yin, cold foods (e.g.,             vegetables). Cancer is considered  yin ; an ear infection is  yang .             Some may associate public health services with             welfare and avoid them due to shame, or confuse them with poverty             programs and not realize they can qualify even if they are employed.             For Khmer, health is seen as being in             equilibrium. Health needs to be individually maintained but is             influenced by family and community members. Illness is seen as             preventable. Nutrition is important to the Khmer, but not physical             activity. The Khmer are often accustomed to screening, but modesty             is an issue that needs to be taken into account.             For Vietnamese, health is also based on a             concept of harmony and balance. Obesity is not of great concern –             instead, it is viewed positively as a sign of good socioeconomic             status and contentment. Personal hygiene and the consumption of lots             of fresh vegetables, fruits, fish, and meat are viewed as promoting             good health. Maintaining a warm environment prevents suffering from             muscle or bone aches. Exercise is not a regular part of daily             activities. The Vietnamese will seek screening if it is emphasized             by a doctor or nurse.             Traditional healers, such as Buddhist monks,             acupuncturists, and herbalists, may be consulted. The Khmer  accha               (religious layperson) performs diagnostic activities and healing             ceremonies in an ill person’s home.  Krou  are healers             specialized in dealing with certain diseases.  Thump   are evil  Krous              who place spells on people.             Traditional remedies, including coining             (rubbing anterior and posterior chest wall with a coin in a vigorous             fashion to diagnose and treat illness by releasing heat) and             accupressure, may be used to supplement other sources of medical             care. Khmer may believe sins of a past life are the cause of             physical illness. Specific activities may also be the source of             physical illness (e.g. back problems due to Khmer Rouge labor             camps). Genetics are not considered. The Khmer are often             uncomfortable giving blood.             Khmer are very modest. Young women spend             considerable time in skin care. Young women have long hair, which is             cut after marriage or the birth of a first child.             Khmer are stoic when in pain. They often use             tiger balm, medicated tapes placed on the area, or cupping (Penny             with small candle is placed on forehead. Candle is lit with inverted             glass placed on top. When jar is removed, dark circle appears on             forehead. It is believed that this sucks out pain).             Khmer are uncomfortable discussing mental             health symptoms. Depression is explained as sadness. Western             medicine is considered too strong for their bodies.             Khmer often go to Western doctors and Cambodian             or Vietnamese physicians simultaneously.             Health care in Southeast Asia tends to be             reactive, based on symptom relief. Prevention is less of a priority.             Some may believe that illness is a punishment for faults.             Traditional healing and natural medicines play an important role in             health care.                   return to         top                                                 Health Status                         The five leading causes of death in Asian             Americans in RI from 1991-1993 were: cancer, heart disease, stroke,             arterial disease, and unintentional injuries. Recent immigrants may             seek employment in positions with a disproportionate number of             occupational hazards.             Cases of tuberculosis are 10 times higher for             Asian Americans in RI than for the general RI population.             There are almost no reported cases of AIDS             among Asians in RI.             Laotians in RI often don’t know enough about             tuberculosis and hepatitis, or how to prevent heart attacks. In             their home country, they may have just expected people to die from             being sick, or seek only spiritual assistance. Thalassemia (blood             disorder) is also widespread among Laotians in RI.                         Behavioral Health Risk Factors                         Less than 1/3 of Asians in RI report exercising             more than 20 minutes, 3 or more times per week, while 45% of all             Rhode Islanders report exercising that often.             More Asians smoke than in the general             population (29.3% vs. 22.4%).             There is less drinking and marijuana use among             Asian Americans in RI in the general RI population.                   return to         top                                                 Health Screening                         Almost 70% of Asian children in RI ages 0-18             months were screened for lead poisoning from 1994-1996 (59% for             state).                         Maternal and Child Health                         Close attention is paid to the diet during             pregnancy, especially if the mother or mother-in-law is present. The             pregnant woman’s diet consists of high-protein foods such as eggs,             meat, and bean curd.             Adolescent pregnancy is not considered a social             problem as long as it is the result of a legal or culturally             sanctioned marriage.             Cesarean deliveries are acceptable to most             Southeast Asians, with the exception of the Hmong. If a Cesarean             delivery is necessary it is important to identify the decision-maker             within the family.             Among the Khmer, prenatal care is not             emphasized. They are not comfortable with Western prenatal classes.             Pregnant women are active but may follow specific cultural             restrictions (e.g. don’t stand in doorway or baby will be stuck in             birth canal; don’t step over others). Herbal medicines are used in             the last trimester and post-partum. Post-partum women are not             encouraged to eat raw salad vegetables or to consume ice, but are             encouraged to eat pork and beef. Bottle-feeding is believed to imply             higher status. Cuddling is uncommon, and babies are sniffed to show             affection.                   return to         top                                                 Diet and Food Practices                         Rice is the main staple of the diet.             Some traditional foods are high in sodium,             including pickled vegetables, fermented soy bean curd, and soy             sauce.             Dairy products are rarely used. Traditional             sources of calcium include soy bean curd, sardines, and leafy green             vegetables.             Fat intake is generally low.             Khmer: Breakfast is often chicken soup or             noodle dish. Other Khmer meals include rice or noodles with fish             paste and vegetables. More elaborate meals include pancakes with             pork, bean sprouts, and fish sauce. Soup and white rice are the two             basic dishes. Fresh milk is not consumed frequently in Cambodia; it             is very expensive, and cows aren’t typically bred for milk. Some             Southeast Asians are also lactose-intolerant.             Many food preferences or customs are tied to             health remedies for various ailments (bamboo discouraged for back             pain; eggplant may affect women’s cycles; certain foods avoided             for skin disease). Younger Khmer like Western foods. Many Khmer are             lactose intolerant and enjoy soy drinks and specially brewed coffee.             Laotians eat a lot of pork and chicken skin;             one contact said 20% of Laotians in RI may have high cholesterol,             but do not eat dairy products.

GX010-74-15097553	"DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES     HHS Fact Sheet on Asian American and Pacific Islander Issues    The Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) population is one of great diversity. It includes a high proportion of immigrants and refugees, is extremely heterogeneous and bimodal in socioeconomic status and health indices.  Differences in languages and cultures among AAPIs reflect not only more than 30 different subgroups, but also generational subgroups. For generations, AAPIs have resided in the United States in significant numbers, and few Pacific Islanders are foreign born.  AAPI subpopulations are as different from each other as they are from other racial and ethnic groups.    Although AAPI populations are growing rapidly -- estimated to reach 10 percent of the total population by the year 2050 -- adequate data on health status are not available and no data system has been developed to systematically monitor their health status. AAPIs are often viewed inaccurately as a homogeneous ""model"" minority with few health or social issues, when in fact they are confronted by issues and barriers like other racial and ethnic minorities. For instance:       Forty percent of AAPIs have limited English proficiency. (Census, 1992).   High school graduate rates range from 31 percent for Hmongs to 88 percent for Japanese. While over half of South Asians earned at least a bachelor's degree, less than six percent of Tongans, Cambodians, Laotians, and Hmongs completed college. (Census, 1995).   In 1993, the poverty rate of AAPI families (14 percent) was higher than that of non-Hispanic White families (8 percent). (Census, 1995).     Emerging data on AAPI subgroups clearly show that there are important disparities in health status, as well as unresolved problems in accessing health and social services. Examples include:        More than 2 million AAPIs are uninsured (Census, 1998).   The age-adjusted death rate for Native Hawaiians is 901 per 100,000, compared to 350 per 100,000 for all AAPIs, and 524 per 100,000 for the total population. The disparity among Native Hawaiians becomes apparent when data is disaggregated by AAPI subgroups. (CDC, 1992).   In  the U.S.-associated Pacific Island jurisdictions, the infant mortality rate exceeded that of the U.S., in some cases by more than two times, ranging from 9.5 per 1,000 in Guam to an estimated high of 52 per 1,000 in the Federated States of Micronesia in 1994.    Chinese Americans have the highest rate of nasopharyngeal cancer of all groups. Liver cancer among Vietnamese Americans is 11.3 times higher than among White Americans. Cervical cancer incidence rates among Vietnamese women are nearly five times higher than that of White women (Miller et al, 1996).   The incidence of tuberculosis is highest among AAPIs, at 41.6 per 100,000, compared to 2.8 for White, non-Hispanics, 22.4 for Black, non-Hispanics, 16.0 for Hispanics, and 14.5 for American Indians/Alaska Natives.(NHIS, 1996)     For AAPIs, many health issues are further affected by recent changes in welfare laws.  Many new AAPI immigrants are not eligible for Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) and Medicaid benefits or perceive that applying for such benefits may jeopardize their ability to become U.S. citizens. Another concern to AAPI communities is the need for culturally and linguistically appropriate services (CLAS). HHS has requested public comment on a set of draft recommended standards for the provision of CLAS which was developed with advice from outside experts. There is a need for on-going work in this area.    HHS's Role in Meeting the Needs of AAPI Communities:  HHS protects the health of all Americans and provides essential human services, especially for those who are least able to help themselves.  In June 1997, HHS launched a department?wide Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Initiative to identify and address the disparities in health status and access to health, mental health, and human services for AAPI communities, and ultimately to ensure that HHS is responsive to those needs and improves AAPIs' quality of life.    The signing of Executive Order (EO)13125 in June 1999 to improve the quality of life of AAPIs established HHS's coordination role in implementing the government?wide EO.  HHS Secretary Donna Shalala advises the President on the progress of the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (WHIAAPI), based on reports from the President's Advisory Commission on AAPIs.  The Executive Director of the WHIAAPI is based at HHS's Health Resources and Services Administration.   Recognizing the challenges presented by the great diversity of AAPI communities, HHS is addressing key issues such as disproportionate rates of morbidity and mortality among some AAPI populations and lack of access to culturally and linguistically appropriate services.  A vital part of the development of the Action Agenda for the HHS AAPI Initiative is community participation.  HHS named Community Coordinators to facilitate consultations with AAPI communities to determine needs.    An overall framework, adopted in November 1997, guides the development of agency plans for the AAPI Action Agenda, and this agenda serves as a plan for carrying out activities and a yardstick for measuring progress. The framework articulated six main goals requiring HHS attention.  In support of the WHIAAPI, the framework goals were cross walked with the EO goals to come up with the following revised set of HHS goals for AAPIs:       Improve the quality of life, health, and well?being of AAPIs by increasing their access to and utilization of health and human services.    Increase and improve collection, analyses, and dissemination of research and data about AAPI populations and subpopulations.     Increase the number of programs and projects, including demonstration grants targeted toward AAPIs.     Increase outreach to and participation of AAPIs in HHS or HHS?sponsored training programs.    Ensure that issues affecting underserved AAPI populations are addressed through increased representation in the HHS work force and participation in HHS operations.                                                             |  Site Map  |  AAPI Home  |  Home  |  OPHS Home  |  HHS Home  |       |  OMHRC Home  |  Disclaimer  |  Privacy Policy  |  Email  |        (Last Modified: July 28, 2000)"

The data for 1998 are placed in a temporal context by comparison with the data for the preceding 10 years.  E985.0 - E985.4 (firearmrelated fatalities undetermined as to whether they were purposely or accidentally inflicted). Data on the number and characteristics of firearm-related fatalities among Arizona residents were obtained from death certificates filed with the Arizona Department of Health Services. Population denominators for Arizona residents, used to calculate rates, are projections from the Population Statistics Unit in the Arizona Department of Economic Security (data for 1988 to 1989 and 1993 to 1998) and the U.S. Census Bureau (data for 1990 and data by ethnic group for 1998). Detailed population data by gender, age and county were unavailable for 1991 to 1992. In order to obtain the population denominators for these two years, the 1990 percentages of population breakdowns (or census shares) by age group and gender were applied to 1991 and 1992 total state or county population estimates published by the DES.  METHODS AND SOURCES In this report, firearm-related fatalities are defined according to the ICD-9* as an underlying cause of death coded as: E922.0 - E922.9 (unintentional or accidental injury caused by firearms), E955.0 - E955.4 (suicide by firearms), E960.0 - E965.4 (homicide by firearms), E970 (fatal injury due to legal intervention by firearms) and  __________________________ *International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries and Causes of Death. Geneva: World Health Organization, 1977.   2  SELECTED FINDINGS This section presents some illustrative findings contained in the figures and tables of the report. It is not intended to be an exhaustive analysis of the tabulated data. When possible, United States data are given in order to provide a comparative context for the Arizona firearmrelated mortality statistics. ! Firearms rank second, surpassed only by motor vehicles, as the leading cause of injury mortality both nationwide and in Arizona. Firearm-related injuries and motor vehicle collisions accounted for more than 5 out of every ten (55.3 percent) injury deaths in Arizona in 1998 ! The number of firearm-related fatalities increased in Arizona by 3.8 percent, from 899 in 1997 to 933 in 1998 (Table 2). ! Compared to national rate Arizonans were more likely to die from firearm injuries in each year from 1988 to 1998 (Figure 1, Table 1). Each year in the nation, about 14 firearmrelated fatalities occur for every 100,000 individuals. In Arizona,  annual rates of death by firearms ranged from 17 to 24/100,000 for the years 1988 to 1998. ! The Arizona age-adjusted firerarm-related mortality rate increased by 2.6 percent from 19.5 firearm-related deaths per 100,000 persons in 1997 to 20.0/100,000 in 1998 (Table 1). ! The 1998 Arizona firearmrelated mortality rate was 83.5 percent higher than the national rate, and 43 percent higher than the Arizona 2000 health objective of 14 weapon-related deaths per 100,000 population. ! While fourth digit ICD codes are available to identify the type of firearm that was used, the vast majority of weapon types are coded on death certificates as ""other and unspecified"" (Table 3). ! All but a small fraction of firearm-related fatalities are intentionally inflicted. Among 933 firearm-related deaths in 1998, 16 (or 1.7 percent) were classified as unintentionally inflicted firearm injuries, 569 (61 percent) as suicides, 318 (34.1 percent) as homicides, 17 (1.8 percent) were fatal injuries inflicted by the police or other law-enforcement agents, and 13 (1.4 percent) were un-   3  determined whether the injury was accidentally or purposely inflicted (Figure 2). ! The firearm-related death rate among Blacks (33.4/100,000) was the highest among ethnic groups in Arizona in 1998. It exceeded the corresponding rates for Asian, American Indian, non-Hispanic white, and Hispanic residents of Arizona by 542, 89, 53 and 49 percent respectively (Figure 3). ! Among non-Hispanic whites, firearm-related fatalities predominantly were a result of suicide (76.6 percent, Figure 4). In contrast, the majority of deaths from firearms were incurred in acts of homicide among Blacks (80 percent) and Hispanics (61.5 percent). Among American Indians, firearmrelated fatalities were equally likely to be incurred in acts of homicide or suicide (44.4 percent). ! Firearm-related fatalities among ethnic minorities occurred at younger ages compared to firearm-related deaths among non-Hispanic whites (Table 6). Nine out of ten (89.9 percent) of 1998 firearmrelated deaths for all ethnic minority groups combined were less than 45 years old, while only  53 percent of firearm-related deaths among white nonHispanics were this young. ! The 1998 mortality rate from firearms among males 33.5/100,000) was 5.6 times greater than the rate of 6.0/100,000 among females (Figure 5, Table 8). Particularly high gender ratios in firearm mortality were evident in 1998 for Hispanics (male rate of 39.5 was 7.7 times the rate of 5.1 for females, Figure 9). ! Annual firearm-related homicide death rates among Arizona residents were at least 33 percent lower than the firearm-related suicide death rates from 1988 to 1998 (Figure 6). ! In each year from 1991 to 1997, annual firearm-related death rates among teenagers 15-19 years of age were the highest among the age groups. In 1998, the highest firearmrelated death rate was among Arizonans 20-44 years old (Table 1). ! Between 1997 and 1998, the total firearm death rate among teenagers 15-19 years old decreased by 29.8 percent from 37.3 to 26.2 fatalities per 100,000 persons (Table 1). The   4  firearm-homicide rate decreased by 16.8 percent from 16.1/100,000 in 1997 to 13.4/100,000 in 1998 (Figure 7, Table 15). At the same time, the rate for firearm-suicide decreased by 33.9 percent from a rate of 18.0/100,000 in 1997 to 11.9/100,000 in 1998. ! In any given year between 1988 and 1998, the annual firearm death rates for Arizona teenagers have been higher than their death rates associated with natural causes of death (such as heart disease or cancer) combined (Figure 8). One of every three deaths among teenagers 15-19 years in 1998 was by firearm (86 out of 298). ! Sixty-seven of every 100 suicide deaths in Arizona (Table 12) and sixty-eight of every 100 murders (Table 13) involved firearms in 1998. ! In 1997 (the latest year for which the firearm death rates are available by State), the ageadjusted firearm mortality rates ranged from 3.5/100,000 in Massachusetts to 56.4/100,000 in the District of Columbia. Arizona ranked sixth highest in the nation (Figure 14).  ! Among adolescents 15-19 years old in 1997, total firearmrelated mortality rates ranged from 2.4/100,000 in Vermont to 240.9/100,000 in the District of Columbia. Arizona adolescents in this age group ranked second highest (Figure 15) among all states. ! Mortality rates for firearmsuicide ranged from a zero (no fatalities) in New Hampshire and Vermont to 18.0 per 100,000 adolescents 15-19 years old in Arizona (Figure 16), the highest rate in the nation. ! Mortality rates for firearmhomicide ranged from a zero (no fatalities) in North and South Dakota and Vermont to 217.6 per 100,000 persons 15-19 years old in the District of Columbia. Arizona ranked seventh highest (Figure 17) among the 50 states and the District of Columbia.   FIREARM-RELATED FATALITIES, ARIZONA, 1988-1998  F  IGURES   Page intentionally left blank for double-sided printing...   7 Figure 1.

Understanding Clinical Trial Barriers    It is important to understand the reasons why so few adults with cancer participate in clinical trials. A few are listed here.    Many people with cancer, or those at high risk for developing cancer, are:      Unaware of the option of participating in clinical    trials. Research has consistently shown that most people are not    aware that clinical trials could be an option for cancer treatment    or prevention.          Unwilling to go against physician's advice or direction.    Research has shown if a person's doctor does not recommend a trial    as an option for cancer treatment or prevention, he or she is very    unlikely to participate in one.          Fearful, distrusting, or suspicious of research. For    many people, the idea of being ""randomized"" to one treatment makes    them feel they have less control over their care. Many are also    fearful of being ""experimented upon"" and not receiving treatment    for their cancer. Many people distrust those in the medical    community, based on past negative experiences or the historical    abuses of research participants.          Unaware of clinical trials. The    reality or the perception that there are no trials in their local    community is a barrier for many people.       Concerned about potential costs of trials. Some people who are insured fear that their insurance company won't cover participation in a clinical trial.  Those who do not have insurance may worry about costs that are not covered by the trial's sponsor.          Facing personal or practical obstacles. There are many    costs, financial and otherwise, to participating in a clinical    trial. Time and travel that are required to seek care at a distant    trial site may be a concern for many people. The indirect costs of    being away from work and family may also be a concern. Finally,    some people may not wish to temporarily leave the care of their    physician to participate in a trial.      Many doctors are:      Unaware of clinical trials. Physicians are not    always aware of available clinical trials. Some may not be aware of    the local resources or may assume that none would be appropriate    for the people they treat.          Unwilling to ""lose control"" of patient's care. Most    doctors feel that relationships with the people they care for are    very important. They want what is best for each person. Some    doctors fear that if a person must be referred elsewhere to    participate in a trial, they may lose control of the person's    care. They may not understand that every effort is made to    maintain the physician relationship, even when a person is on a    trial. In addition, many doctors may fear the loss of income if a    person is referred elsewhere for his or her cancer care.          Under the impression that standard therapy is best. Many    physicians may not adequately understand how clinical trials are    conducted or the importance of clinical research. Some physicians    believe that the treatment in clinical trials is not as good as    the standard treatment they might provide to people. They also may    be uncomfortable admitting that there is uncertainty about which    treatment is best in a phase 3 clinical trial.      Additional Clinical Trial Barriers for Ethnically Diverse Populations     There is long-standing fear, apprehension, and skepticism in minority populations about medical research due to real abuses that have happened in the past (e.g., the legacy of the Tuskegee syphilis study). Among these populations, there is often widespread fear and distrust of the medical care system as a result of discrimination, indifference, and disrespect. Some may feel that they do not want to give up their rights by participating in a trial, or lose their power by being ""experimented upon."" Others may be skeptical about the quality of care that would be provided in a clinical trial. Some may find that trial recruitment strategies are not sensitive to their needs.    Doctors may not mention clinical trials as an option for cancer care.  As noted above, many physicians do not refer their patients to clinical trials.  However, some physicians may avoid suggesting a clinical trial to their minority patients, out of concern that patients would see him/her as insensitive. Moreover, some physicians may unwittingly discriminate against older patients, or those who are from certain ethnic or cultural backgrounds.    Many people may face additional problems accessing clinical trials. Depending on where they live or their access to transportation, people may have difficulty getting back and forth from a clinical trial site. Those with low income may find it difficult to take time off work or find appropriate childcare. Other barriers, such as a lack of health insurance or lack of general health care, clearly present difficulties in accessing trials.    Cultural or ethnic backgrounds may include values and beliefs that are very different from Western Medicine. Many people have cultural beliefs that Western medicine cannot address their health concerns. Different ethnic and cultural views of health and disease (e.g., fatalism, family decisions about treatment, use of traditional healers, prayer, herbal medicines, or use of complementary/alternative health practices) may make clinical trials a less attractive treatment option. For prevention trials, many may feel that the risk of a potential disease and its consequences may be less important than meeting daily needs.    Language and/or literacy barriers may make it difficult for some people to understand and consider participating in clinical trials. The complexity of forms, including informed consent documents, may also be a barrier to those considering participation in a clinical trial. Translation can also be difficult if the person translating information has not had specialized training.      General Strategies for Educating Diverse Populations    One of the biggest hurdles for clinical trial education is overcoming suspicion of medical research.    It is important to note that strategies for clinical trial outreach and education will vary, based on the type of trial and its requirements for participation. Although some of the following strategies were designed for cancer prevention trials, many may also be used for other types of clinical trials.    Strategy 1    Educators should be familiar (and preferably a part of) the communities they are trying to reach. People who are known, trusted, and accountable will be more effective and more believable when discussing clinical trials with community members.    Suggested Steps      Use easy to understand language. In some cases    this may mean using a community's first language.       Involve people from the community, especially community    leaders. Find ways to develop collaboration and encourage    ownership in the outreach program.                              Tip                      If you are not from the population(s) you seek to work          with, it is critical that you or your organization develop          meaningful collaborative partnerships with organizations          within those communities.                     Strategy 2    Address important concerns and perceptions, benefits, and risks about clinical trials through one-on-one contact. One-on-one contact is one of the best ways to educate others.    Suggested Steps      Make sure you do not judge someone's values if    they are different from your own. Find ways to present information    that complement the values someone holds.          Address risks and costs in a frank, open, and honest    way.          Stress the importance of enrollment in trials to the    family and to future generations.          Stress the importance of equal access to the highest    quality care, including clinical trials. Each person has the right    to know and understand every option available with regard to his    or her health care.          Promote the balance of spirituality, faith, medicine,    and science.          See the next section for suggested messages for specific    ethnic/ racial groups.      Strategy 3    Discuss potential benefits of participating in a clinical trial; but do not overlook the risks.    Suggested Step    Discuss the fact that because people are monitored closely under clinical trial protocols, they often receive a higher quality of medical care and follow up than do those who are not enrolled in clinical trials.    Strategy 4      Avoid disrupting home and work schedules when conducting education or outreach activities.    Suggested Steps      Hold meetings after church or other social    activities.          Suggest incorporating evening and weekend hours into    required trial visits.                              Key Points for Outreach and Education                                   Clinical trial outreach strategies must          incorporate an understanding of a potential participant's          decision-making process, his or her culture, family and work          life, and economic concerns. Those conducting education and          outreach must find ways to present clinical trial          information that complement the values people in the          community hold.                      Education and outreach strategies should stress          the importance of equal access to the highest quality care,          including clinical trials. Each person has the right to know          and understand every health care option available.                      Clinical trials must be explained in a way that is          respectful and easy to understand, addresses someone's fears          and concerns, and addresses risks and benefits.                      The research team must ensure that the informed          consent process truly reflects a participant's understanding          of the risks and benefits of the clinical trial. Involving          family, members from the participant's community, and          culturally competent staff are some ways to help verify that          the participant has received the information in a way that          he or she can understand and made the decision to          participate voluntarily.                                                                                                                                              Specific Strategies for Educating Ethnically Diverse Populations    Research has shown that there are many differences in who gets cancer among people of different races, ethnicities, and socioeconomic backgrounds. Certain racial and ethnic groups, as noted on the pages that follow, are also more likely to die of cancer than other groups. These differences may be due to a variety of reasons, such as late stage of disease at diagnosis, barriers to health care access, history of other diseases, biologic and genetic differences in tumors, health behaviors, and the presence of other risk factors for cancer. In addition, some cancers that have a high rate of developing in one ethnic group are rare and may not be listed among the top 10 cancers in the U.S. population as a whole.* Because rare  cancers may not receive as much attention as those in the ""top 10,"" it is even more important for people of particular ethnic and cultural groups to be aware of  research so that they can work to find ways to decrease the burden of these unusual cancers in their populations.    Differences in cancer screening and treatment have also been documented for people of different ages, as well as those from different socioeconomic, educational, and racial/ethnic backgrounds.        *Based on the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program. SEER is the most authoritative source of information on cancer incidence and survival in the United States.     Information on data sources used in this section:   Cancer incidence data come from the NCI SEER program, covering 14 percent of the U.S. population.   Cancer mortality data come from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and covers the entire U.S. population.  Cancer incidence and death rates for some racial and ethnic  populations may be limited by problems in ascertaining race and by the misreporting of race and ethnicity on forms used to collect information on cancer incidence, deaths, and the populations at risk. For instance, while reporting race for African-American and White populations is generally considered reliable, biases are more serious for smaller populations, particularly American Indian/Alaskan Natives, as well as for groups living in smaller geographical  areas.  Additionally, it is important to note that Hispanics can be of any race and are not mutually exclusive from White, African Americans, Asian/Pacific Islanders, and American Indian/Alaskan Natives. These biases can affect trends and comparisons among groups.    Ethnically Diverse Populations-Some Definitions    Diverse populations include minority, ethnic, and racial groups designated by the U.S. Government, including:      American Indian or Alaska Native       Asian American       Black or African American    Hispanic or Latin American       Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander       Ethnically diverse populations are growing rapidly, and according to the 2000 Census, about 25 percent of the U.S. population reported their race as something other than White.    About 17 percent of the U.S. population over age 5 (more than 44 million people) do not speak English at home.  Of these,     Almost half speak English ""less than very well""   About 60 percent speak Spanish 1       NCI's working definition of diverse populations also includes medically-underserved populations, such as rural, low-income, and low-literacy level individuals of any racial or ethnic group. Medically underserved populations are those that lack easy access to, or do not make use of, high-quality cancer prevention, screening and early detection, treatment, or rehabilitation services. In general, these groups experience higher cancer death rates than the U.S. population as a whole.    Outreach Strategies    The strategies listed below are not meant to be a complete overview of barriers and strategies; nor should the information be generalized to all people in these groups. Attitudes within various populations vary greatly, depending on a person's age, socioeconomic status, community, and other factors. The broad outline here provides some background, context, and potential strategies for potential education and advocacy efforts.                            Participation of Different Groups in          NCI Treatment Clinical Trials 2                      The percentage of White patients enrolled in NCI clinical trials parallels that of the overall U.S. population. However, different patterns are seen for Black, Asian American, and Hispanic cancer patients.     Black children and young adults have accrual to clinical trials comparable to their White peers, as do Black women.   Asian American and Hispanic children and young adults have accrual to clinical trials comparable to their White peers.   The percentage of Black men who have cancer and are 30 to 59 years old who participate in clinical trials is markedly lower than the percentage of White men with cancer in this age group.   The percentage of Asian Americans and Hispanics aged 30 to 80 that accrue to clinical trials is less than that of Whites.   In terms of age, those 80 years of age or older are least likely to be enrolled, followed by those aged 30 to 39 years.                                       Patient accrual for NCI-sponsored cancer treatment trials by sex and race/ethnicity  2     Race/Ethnic Group   Males (%)   Females (%)   Percentage of U.S. Population      White   36   46   72     Black   4   5   12     Hispanic   4   3   12     Asian   1   1   4     American Indian   0.5   0.5   1     Hawaiian/Pacific Islander   0.5   0.5   0.5     Total   44   56   100          Percentage of estimated United States female population represented in NCI-sponsored  cancer treatment clinical trials: log scale (by age and race/ethnic group) 2            Percentage of estimated United States male population represented in NCI-sponsored  cancer treatment clinical trials: log scale (by age and race/ethnic group) 2             African Americans and Clinical Trials    Background    A person who is Black or African American has origins in any of the Black racial groups of Africa. This definition includes:      Native-born Black Americans          Africans          Haitians          Residents of non-Spanish-speaking Caribbean Islands of    African descent      Cancer in African Americans   (Unless otherwise noted, all data is age-adjusted incidence or mortality rates between 1992 and 1999.) 3    Overall, African Americans had the highest risk of any U.S.  racial/ethnic group of not only getting cancer, but also for dying from cancer.    African American Men:     Of all ethnic and gender groups, African American men have the highest overall rate of having cancer.   Of all ethnic and gender groups, African American men have the highest overall rate of dying from cancer.   Of all men, African Americans have the highest incidence and death rates from many cancers, including lung and bronchus, prostate, and colon and rectum cancer. In addition, in 2001, African American men were at least 50 percent more likely to get prostate cancer than were men of any other ethnic group. 4       Top five cancers: Prostate, lung and bronchus, colon and rectum, oral cavity and pharynx, and stomach    African American Women:     Of all women, African Americans have the highest incidence rates for colon and rectal cancer, lung and bronchial cancer, and pancreatic cancer.   Of all women, African Americans have the highest death rates from many cancer, including breast, colon and rectal, pancreatic, uterine, and cervical cancers.   While they have the second highest rates of all women of getting breast cancer, they have the highest rate of dying from the disease.      Top five cancers: Breast, colon and rectal, lung and bronchial, uterine, and pancreatic    Challenges    The legacy of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study (in which researchers studied but did not treat African American men with syphilis) has contributed to long-standing mistrust in African American communities concerning clinical research. Widespread skepticism about the medical care system exists as a result of a long history of discrimination, indifference, and disrespect. The oral history contributing to this mistrust is particularly important to recognize.    Some African Americans may believe that if they agree to participate in a trial, they will not be appropriately cared for, nor honestly informed of the risks or the benefits. They may fear that: 5      Placebos would be substituted for lifesaving    interventions          Treatments that work would be deliberately withheld          They would not receive a full course of treatment,    especially if funding sources for the clinical trial were no    longer available      Other cultural beliefs and attitudes that affect research participation include hopelessness, fatalism, and doubt about the usefulness of cancer prevention and control. Faith, folk remedies, and the role of the family are other important influences for African Americans. 6    Clinical trials may be a lower priority to African Americans and others who have a low income, less access to transportation and health care, less information about clinical trials, and low levels of literacy. Concerns about family and work responsibilities may also be a significant barrier. 7  African American men have noted concerns about researchers not giving back to the community, being uncomfortable talking about prostate cancer, and past negative experiences with the medical care system. 8    Potential Solutions    Cultural strategies:      Find people who are already active in    organizations to help spread the word about clinical trials.  People who are known, trusted, and accountable in the community will be better    messengers than will outsiders.          Explore partnerships with African American churches,    particularly for health issues central to the mission of the    church. Faith is a very important part of many African American    cultures and the most successful outreach efforts usually involve    churches that have two or more paid clergy, and medium or large    memberships.          Ensure that the informed consent process truly reflects    the participant's understanding of the risks and benefits of the    clinical trial. Involving family, members from the participant's    community, and culturally competent staff are some ways to help    verify that the participant has received the information in a way    that he or she can understand and made the decision to participate    voluntarily.      Program strategies:      Talk about trials using one-on-one    contact-preferably with another African American person-through    churches, schools, civic organizations, and African American    sororities and fraternities. Word of mouth can be an effective  way to reach others.          Conduct in person outreach to complement other education    efforts using videos, brochures, or advertisements.          Present real-life situations that exemplify statistics    or written messages. Effective dialogue can take place through a    church-sponsored forum or an educational session that allows for    open discussion and questioning.          Involve local celebrities, including DJs at African    American radio stations, by asking them to share messages about clinical    trials.          Ask newspapers and local media to join in education    efforts.          Provide personal, ""real world"" discussion of clinical trials and    follow up in any education program.      Key Messages    Distrust of medical research is a critical issue, but it is important that African Americans be presented with an opportunity to find answers to research questions. The prospect of learning information that will help all people access treatment and better manage disease can be a powerful motivator.    Some African Americans may be more interested in clinical trials if they understand that participation means they:         Contribute to their community and their families          Join a group of people like themselves nationally, and    in their local community      Clinical trial educational messages need to include information on the following topics:      Severity of the cancer problem nationwide          Underlying myth that African Americans don't need to be    concerned about cancer          Toll that cancer (especially breast and prostate) is    taking on African American women and men-and that we don't know    why          Prevention and treatment options for high-risk African    Americans-and the need for more research          Importance of clinical trials-and what it means for all    people if all groups are not represented in a trial          Laws on participant protection and rights          What risk means for the individual and others in his or    her community      Asian Americans and Clinical Trials    Background    A person who is Asian has origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, and Indian subcontinent. The term ""Asian"" refers to persons from the following and other Asian, Southeast Asian, and South Asian backgrounds:                                     Chinese            Vietnamese            Pakistani            Filipino            Cambodian            Thailandian            Japanese            Hmong            East Indian                                               Korean            Laotian            Bangladeshi            Indonesian            Sri Lankan            Nepalese            Bhutanese            Sikh            Burmese                                                     ""Asian Americans"" and ""Pacific Islanders"" are two discernibly distinctive groups, comprised of numerous heterogeneous ethnic subpopulations. These broad categories fail to show mortality rates that, in some instances, strongly differ among ethnic groups.  Whenever possible, this publication separates out these groups.                                  U.S. residents who reported they were Asian* make up 4.2 percent of the total population. Chinese is the leading Asian group (2.7 million) followed by Filipino (2.4 million) and East Indian (1.9 million). 1    *Self report, alone or in combination with one or more other races    The Asian population includes many groups who differ in language, culture, and length of residence in the United States. Some of the Asian groups, such as the Chinese and Japanese, have been in the United States for several generations and often have literacy, education, and socioeconomic characteristics that are above the national average. On the other hand, groups such as the Hmong, Vietnamese, Laotians, and Cambodians are comparatively recent immigrants, and tend to have limited acculturation and poverty rates below the national average.  It is important to note that 88 percent of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) are either foreign-born themselves or have at least one foreign-born parent. Of those who speak Asian and Pacific Island languages at home, more than 22 percent say they speak English ""not well"" or ""not at all."" 1    Cancer in Asians   (Unless otherwise noted, all data is age-adjusted incidence or mortality rates between 1992 and 1999).) 3    Some Asians are much more devoted to traditional medical practices than to Western medicine. For example, a study of breast and cervical cancer screening in Chinese women found that more than 2/3 had gone to traditional providers for preventive health care, went to temples to pray for their health, and looked to fortune-tellers for guidance. 9  Another study of cervical cancer screening in Cambodian women indicated beliefs that fate cannot be changed by detection, cancer is incurable, and cancer will not develop if traditional practices are used. 10    Like the Hispanic/Latino populations, Asian/Pacific Islanders experience lower incidence and mortality rates overall compared with other minority groups.  However, they do experience higher incidence and mortality rates for certain cancers. Based on three-year averages, more than 18 percent of Asian and Pacific Islanders lack health insurance.    Asian/Asian Pacific Islander men:     Of all men, AAPIs have the highest incidence rates of liver and stomach cancer.   Of all men, AAPIs have the highest death rates from liver cancer.      Asian/Asian Pacific Islander women:     Seventy percent of Asian Americans come from countries with the world's lowest overall rates of breast cancer, yet after living in the U.S. for as little as 10 years, Asian women have an 80 percent higher risk of getting the disease than recent immigrants.   In addition, third and fourth generation Asian American women have rates of developing breast cancer that are similar to their neighboring Caucasian women. 11   Asian American women in general have the lowest rates of Pap test, mammogram, and breast exam screening of any ethnic group. 6,11   Of all women, Asians have the highest rates of liver and stomach cancer.   Of all women, Asians have the highest death rates for liver and stomach cancer.                              Cancer in Specific Asian Groups            The NCI SEER cancer incidence rates noted in this publication are available for different levels of racial/ethnic detail in each of the time periods (1988-1992 and 1992-1999).             Although the SEER program routinely collects detailed racial/ethnic information on the cancer patients in its coverage areas, the lack of comparable detail in the racial/ethnic county-level population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau means that incidence rates for certain racial/ethnic groups can be calculated only for time periods centered on the decennial census. For example, county-level census information for Asian and Pacific Islanders by subgroups (Chinese, Filipinos, Hawaiians, etc.) is still only available from the 1990 Census.                  From 1988 to 1992, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese* groups all had higher rates of getting liver and intrahepatic bile duct (IHB) and stomach cancers than Whites, and Chinese and Japanese had higher mortality than Whites from these two cancers, as well. 12  In this same time period, Korean and Vietnamese women had higher incidence rates of cervical cancer than White women. 12    *Liver and IHB not calculated for Vietnamese women    From 1988 through 1992, the top five cancers for many Asian groups are as follows: 12    Women:       Men:       Challenges    Values in many Asian cultures may be different than the Euro-American system, with decisions reached by consensus, group welfare being of primary value, and individual life not as sacred. 6  In some Asian cultures, the family is responsible for treatment decisions and the patient is not told of his or her diagnosis.    Many in the Asian immigrant communities need a lot of support as they learn about clinical trials, and they need to feel safe asking questions. ""Saving face"" in public is important. In many cases, Asian immigrants may feel it is disrespectful to ask questions of doctors or health professionals.    Recent immigrants also may be dealing with a combination of educational, social, and health problems, along with emotional difficulties related to separation and isolation. Many are in low-wage jobs and need to get permission to take time off work to take care of health care needs.    The language barrier also is difficult to overcome. Many Asians do not speak English, and this may not be readily apparent. There are so many Asian languages that deciding on the language(s) in which information should be printed is difficult. This barrier is particularly important in issues surrounding informed consent. The informed consent process is intimidating for all people and is especially so for those with limited English skills.    Potential Solutions    Cultural strategies:      Assess how long the group you are trying to reach    has been in this country as well as the countries of origin represented. It is    important to fit the educational outreach to the culture and to    use people from the communities to reach community members.       Involve family members in learning about the risks and    benefits of clinical trials, but resist using them as translators of medical information. In particular, avoid having children-who may be more proficient in English than their parents-serve as translators. It is preferable to enlist someone who is trained for this work.       Ensure that the informed consent process truly reflects    the participant's understanding of the risks and benefits of the    clinical trial. Involving family, members from the participant's    community, and culturally competent staff are some ways to help    verify that the participant has received the information in a way    that he or she can understand and made the decision to participate    voluntarily.      Language strategies:      Find respectful ways to make sure that information    is being understood. Someone who does not understand English may    say ""yes"" or nod, even if they do not understand what is being    said. To ensure that the person you are talking with understands what you have said, staff may ask, ""Many people have a hard time understanding information like this. I want to make sure that I explain it clearly. Could you please tell me, in your words, what I have just said.""    When translating materials, at least two bilingual, bicultural translators should be used. In addition, materials should be pilot-tested with the target audience.      Program strategies:      Use health fairs, which have been successful when    organized by community members, and involve the leadership of    existing Asian groups in clinical trial outreach.        If possible, translate clinical trial information to be    used in ethnic newspapers. Many immigrant groups get their health    information from press that is printed in their own languages.        Invite a professional to deliver information about    clinical trials. Preferably, a doctor or nurse from that community    should be invited, who can encourage others to ask questions.    Often, laypeople do not have much credibility as an information    source.       Keep workshops or programs short (30 to 40 minutes) because many new immigrants    have more than one job, in addition to other responsibilities.    While recent immigrants may not have been concerned with breast cancer in their countries of origin, it is important to educate these women about their increased risk for this disease.      Key Messages      A family's receptivity to    cancer treatments and trials will depend on the experience that    relatives have had with the medical system. For example, if a relative did not    survive cancer, it may be taboo to talk about him or her.     Remember    to consider feminine modesty and traditional gender role values.          Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders and Clinical Trials 13                            Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders are often          aggregated nationally into the ""Other"" category or currently          the ""Asian American/Pacific Islander or AAPI"" category.          It is important to note that these are two discernibly distinctive groups, comprised of numerous          heterogeneous ethnic subpopulations.                      These groupings have obscured disparate mortality rates          that are prevalent in one group and not the other. Whenever possible, this publication separates out these groups.                     Background    Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders of Polynesian, Micronesian, and Melanesian ancestry* made up 0.3 percent of the total U.S. population. 1   This group comprises more than 25 diverse groups with variations in historical backgrounds, languages, and cultural traditions.    *Alone or in combination with one or more races.    Among Pacific Islanders in the United States, Native Hawaiians are the largest group, 58 percent (211,014). Three-fourths of Pacific Islanders live in the states of California and Hawaii and they are a relatively young population, with a median age of 25 years and an average family size of 4.1.    The term ""other Pacific Islanders,"" refers to the peoples of Polynesia, Micronesia, and Melanesia, and includes:                                      Chamorros            Samoans            Fijians            Tongans            Tahitians            Marshallese                                               Chuukese            Kosraen            Yapese            Pohnpeian            Palauan            Other Pacific Islanders                              Within this group are six U.S.-associated Pacific Island jurisdictions--the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Palau, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas-that have various political relationships with the U.S.    The population of the U.S.-associated Pacific Island jurisdictions is approximately 427,000. The health status varies within and among the jurisdictions, but is generally worse than for Americans. The jurisdictions must contend with health conditions found in both developing countries (e.g., malnutrition, dengue fever, cholera, and tuberculosis) and developed countries (e.g., diabetes, heart disease, and cancer).    Cancer in Native Hawaiians    Hawaiian Men:   (For the years 1988-1992) 12     Have the second highest cancer mortality, behind only African Americans   Of all men and of all ethnic groups,                Have the highest cancer mortality for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma         Have the second highest rates for cancers of the lung and bronchus and pancreas             Top five cancers: Lung and bronchus, prostate, colon and rectum, stomach, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma    Hawaiian Women:   (For the years 1988-1992) 12      Are tied with African Americans for the second highest cancer mortality (second only to Alaska Natives).   Of all women and all ethnic groups:                              Have the highest death rate for cancers of the stomach and uterus               Have the second highest incidence rates for cancers of the lung and bronchus                  Top five cancers: Breast, lung and bronchus, colon and rectum, uterine, and stomach    Cancer in Pacific Islanders    Cancer surveillance and databases are rudimentary or non-existent in most of these jurisdictions, rendering cancer rates unknown. What is known is that cancer is among the top three causes of death. The most commonly reported cancers for males were cancers of the lung and prostate, and for females, cancers of the breast, cervix, and lung.    Challenges      A history of oppression, higher prevalence of    behavioral risk factors, ineffective cancer prevention and control    efforts, and poor access to state-of-the-art services for cancer    prevention, early detection, and treatment (including low    representation in clinical trials) contribute to increased cancer    risk and mortality among Native Hawaiians and other Pacific    Islanders.       Many Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders are    socio-economically disadvantaged and underserved in terms of    access to health and social services.       In the U.S., many Pacific Islanders do not speak English    at home.       There is a general distrust of research among island    communities. This distrust can also have negative consequences for    those participating in a trial, such as poor compliance or    avoidance.       Geographic barriers are a problem for many Pacific    Islanders; clinical trials are unavailable for most Western    Pacific and Samoan communities and rural Hawaiian communities.       The conduct of many clinical trials lacks cultural sensitivity    and does not address language needs; it also does not interpret cultural    behaviors and preferences.      Potential Solutions    Cultural strategies:      Tailor the educational outreach to the culture and    use ""cultural brokers"" (members of the community) to reach other community    members.       Include the family unit, which for many Native Hawaiians    and Pacific Islanders includes extended family members and    friends, when educating about the risks and benefits of clinical    trials. The role of the woman is central to the family in many    Pacific Island cultures.       Ensure that the informed consent process truly    represents the participant's understanding of the risks and    benefits of the clinical trial. Involving family, members from the    participant's community, and culturally competent staff are some    ways to help verify that the participant has received the    information in a way that he or she can understand and made the    decision to participate voluntarily.      Program strategies:      Use personal contacts through a family member or a    friend to do education and outreach.       Explain the benefits of research to the community at    large.       Address issues of medical care that are not covered by    clinical trials, as these are an important concern for    participants who may not have insurance or are underinsured.      Native Americans and Clinical Trials 14,15    Background    A person who is considered Native American has origins in any of the original peoples of North or South America (including Central America) and maintains tribal affiliation or community attachment.    The term ""Native American"" refers to:      American Indians       Alaska Natives:                    Aleuts             Eskimos               Native Americans are made up of culturally distinct and diverse communities. The U.S. contains 511 federally recognized tribes, with Native American people living in every State. The largest tribes are Cherokee and Navajo. More than 9 percent of the U.S. population reported American Indian or Alaska Native status in the 2000 Census.    Indian Health Service    There are more than 300 hospitals and health clinics, located on or near Indian reservations, run by the Indian Health Service (IHS). In recent years, many tribes have assumed management of some of these health care facilities.    The Indian clinics and hospitals are unable to provide the high-tech medical care needed to diagnose and treat cancer. For this reason, the IHS Contract Health Services program pays for Indian health care provided by non-IHS providers. However, this program is chronically short of funds. Depending on the region/tribe, its local priorities, and funding remaining in the service contract, certain treatments may not be available. At present the Contract Health Services does not reimburse for many treatments that are deemed ""experimental,"" which keeps many Indian people out of clinical trials.    Although 54 percent of Native Americans live in urban areas, less than 2 percent of the IHS budget is spent in urban clinics. 6  These clinics are severely underfunded and must rely on other sources of support, including Medicaid revenue. Many urban Indians choose to return to their home reservations for care.    Based on 3-year averages, American Indians and Alaska Natives were the least likely of the major racial groups to have health insurance. 1A    Cancer in Native Americans   (Unless otherwise noted, all data is age-adjusted incidence or mortality rates between 1992 and 1999.) 3    While American Indian/Alaska Natives experience some of the lowest cancer rates among all ethnic groups, they do experience higher incidence and mortality for certain cancers. Cancer is the second leading cause of death among Native Americans and is the leading cause of death among Alaska Native women. 16,17      American Indian/Alaska Native Men:     Of all men and all ethnic groups, have the highest mortality rate for kidney and renal cancer      Top five cancers: Prostate, lung and bronchial, colon and rectal, kidney and renal pelvis, and stomach    American Indian/Alaska Native Women:     Have the highest incidence rate of  gallbladder cancer   Have the highest mortality rate for kidney and renal cancer         Top five cancers: Breast, colon and rectum, lung and    bronchial, uterine, and ovarian                            Alaska Natives            (For the years 1988-1992) 12             Alaska Native men had the highest rates of getting colon and rectal cancer among all ethnic groups.           In this same time period, Alaska Native women had the highest rates for getting and dying from colon, rectal, and lung cancer among ethnic groups, and their rates of getting cervical cancer were twice as high as those for White women.             The top cancers:                           Men: Lung and bronchus, colon and rectum, prostate, and stomach               Women: Breast, colon and rectum, lung and bronchus, and cervical                           American Indians (Living in New Mexico)              American Indian men had the highest rates of all ethnic groups of getting kidney cancer. In this same period, American Indian women had higher rates of cervical and ovarian cancers than the U.S. White female population.                          Top cancers in American Indians:                              Men: Prostate, colon and rectal, kidney and renal pelvis, and lung and bronchus                Women: Breast, ovarian, colon and rectal, gallbladder, and uterine                         Challenges      A history of disrespect, racism, and poverty has    contributed to a distrust of science and research by Native    American populations. To protect the interests of Native American people, many    tribes have their own Institutional Review Board (IRB), in    addition to those required by Indian Health Service (IHS) or    tribal facility. Successful clinical trial outreach requires that    the investigator work closely with the tribal IRB in addition to    those of the IHS.       Native Americans are a culturally distinct and diverse    community and their beliefs about cancer, and experiences with    diabetes, alcoholism, poverty, and traditional roles can    significantly affect the success of clinical trial educational    programs.       On average, Native Americans are younger, have a lower    rate of high school completion, and have higher rates of poverty    and unemployment than Whites. 6       Many Native people do not have access to quality health    care.       Many tribes do not have a word for cancer in their    languages and historically, the disease was thought of as    something that affected only the ""White man."" Some Native    Americans may hold a fatalistic attitude toward cancer, and fear    that if they talk about cancer or even think about it, they might    catch it.       It is unlikely that Native Americans would participate    in a cancer trial without hearing messages from other Native    Americans, yet there are few cancer survivors to serve as role    models.       Informed consent forms and procedures may serve as a    barrier to recruitment because the language used in such forms may    not be well understood.       Because of other pressing health issues, such as    diabetes, obesity, and substance abuse, in addition to extreme    poverty, cancer screening and treatment may not be as important to    some Native people.    There may be a tribal taboo on the loss of body parts    that needs to be discussed in relation to clinical trials.       Transportation is an important barrier for Native    Americans who live in rural areas.       Differences in communication styles are important to consider.    Many Native Americans are reserved, reluctant to ask questions, or    don't discuss their health problems. Body language also is    important, with respect for personal space and friendly gestures    such as smiling and eye contact being key.       Traditional roles are such    that women are usually caretakers and often place their needs    last. In addition, Native American women value modesty and    privacy, and many traditional Native American couples find a male    health care provider for the woman unacceptable.      Potential Solutions    Cultural strategies:      Use group activities such as sharing and caring    for others because they are universal concepts among Native    people, and should be a part of any clinical trial education    program.       Incorporate the use of traditional healing ceremonies as    well as spiritual connections, which can be very important for    people in these communities.       Family plays a central role in American Indian life. The    needs of the family may take precedence over the needs of the    individual. When appropriate, the patient's family should be    involved in the decision-making process.       Ensure that the informed consent process truly    represents the participant's understanding of the risks and    benefits of the clinical trial. Involving family, members from the    participant's community, and culturally competent staff are some    ways to help verify that the participant has received the    information in a way that he or she can understand and made the    decision to participate voluntarily.      Language strategies:      Use easy-to-understand language and a gentle    approach to education and outreach. Try to include materials that    portray Native Americans.        Make sure that patient consent forms are understood.    Reading out loud or encouraging consultation with others may be    important.      Program strategies:      Emphasize that participation in a trial can help    improve cancer care for the next generation.       Use stories and visual tools that focus on the    family.       Use one-on-one or small group education and outreach    techniques to respect privacy.       Work with community or tribal elders such as community    health representatives and public health nurses, to find out the    best ways to conduct outreach and education efforts.       Find out if transportation is needed to get to the site.       Use public service announcements on Native American    radio.      Key Messages      Messages should be culturally relevant and discuss    issues related to family and community.       Tribal beliefs are very diverse and programs should be    designed on a site-specific basis with the help of tribal    advisors.      Hispanics and Clinical Trials    Background    The terms ""Hispanic"" and ""Latino"" refer to people born in North, Central, and South America, and in the Caribbean whose language is Spanish. Someone who is Hispanic or Latino is a person of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race.    In the mainland United States today the largest groups within the Hispanic community are:      Mexican (58.5%)       Puerto Rican (9.6%)        Central American (4.8%) (Salvadorian, Guatemalan,    Honduran, Nicaraguan, Panamanian, and other people from countries    in Central America)          South American (3.8%) (Colombian, Ecuadorian, Peruvian,    Argentinean, Venezuelan, Chilean, and other people from countries    in South America)          Cuban (3.5%)      The Hispanic population is the fastest growing ethnic group in the U.S. In the 2000 Census, Hispanics eclipsed African Americans to become the second largest ethnic group, with 12.5 percent of the population reporting Hispanic or Latino status. Hispanics as a group comprise many different races and ethnicities. Within these subpopulations, other differences exist according to culture, beliefs, lifestyles, and experiences, but Hispanics agree that certain commonalities go beyond specific nationalities. In general, the U.S. Hispanic population is younger, with more people per household, and has lower rates of employment, less education, and lower economic status than do Whites. 6    There are 28 million U.S. residents aged 5 and older who speak Spanish at home-about 10 percent of the U.S. population. These percentages vary greatly throughout the United States; for example, states like California, Texas, and New Mexico, have approximately 30 percent of residents who speak languages other than English. 1  Among all those who speak Spanish at home, almost half speak English ""less than very well."" It is important to note that in 2000, 68 percent of the U.S. population is foreign-born or had at least one parent who was foreign-born. 1      Cancer in Hispanics*   (Unless otherwise noted, all data is age-adjusted incidence or mortality rates between 1992 and 1999.) 3   *""Hispanic"" is not mutually exclusive from Whites, African American, Asian/Pacific Islanders, and Native Americans.    Although Hispanics had the largest reduction in cancer mortality rates of any U.S. ethnic group (-1.6 percent) they also had the greatest number of uninsured people. Based on three-year averages, more than 33 percent of all Hispanics lack health insurance coverage. 1a  A recent study showed that uninsured Hispanic women are more than two times more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer at a later stage than other women, and uninsured Hispanic men are almost four times more likely to be diagnosed with a later stage of prostate cancer than non-Hispanics. 19    While Hispanics/Latinos have lower incidence and death rates overall compared with those of African Americans and Whites, they do experience higher rates for certain cancers.    Latino/Hispanic men:     Have the third highest incidence and death rates for prostate cancer      Top five cancers: Prostate, lung and bronchus, colon and rectal, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and stomach    Latina/Hispanic women:     Have the highest incidence rates for cervical cancer and the second highest death rate from the disease.      Top five cancers: Breast, colon and rectal, lung and bronchus, cervical, and uterine        Challenges 20      Many Hispanics have strong religious and cultural    beliefs. Some may believe strongly in ""fatalismo"" (fatalism) and    ""resignación"" (resignation)-that diseases or illness cannot    be controlled because they are inherited.       Many may use folk remedies [such as ""uña de    gato""(cat's nail)] to treat cancer or wait until they are in    serious pain to see a doctor.       In one study, barriers that were identified by Latinas    considering a cervical cancer trial included transportation, fear    of getting a placebo, care of children and family, and care from a    male provider. 7       Although Spanish is one language, regional dialects need    to be considered when translating materials.       The language barrier is particularly important in issues    surrounding informed consent. The informed consent process is    intimidating for all people and is especially so for those with    limited English skills.       Some Hispanics think that cancer treatment will only    prolong life but that no effective cure exists for the disease.    Even if people are treated, it is felt that the type of treatment    depends on the person's ability to pay.       Hispanics may not obtain health care until they are very    sick and cannot perform normal functions. This adds to the number    and severity of health problems that need to be evaluated.    However, women are more likely than men to seek medical care.       Many in the Hispanic community feel that doctors do not    communicate well with them and they do not feel well informed    about trials. Many hold the perception that doctors may have    financial interests in a trial, and there is a lack of trust    around participating in scientific research.       A sense of fatalism and resignation is usually strongest    in women and older men. This may make people feel that treatment    is useless.       Machismo is a barrier because men feel they are the    family protectors and should not show weakness.       Hispanics' biggest barriers to accessing health care are    money, time, and language. Other common problems include lack of    insurance, problems with transportation or childcare, and getting    off work to see a doctor.        Although face-to-face interaction is important,    Hispanics would not welcome unknown health educators or volunteers    into their homes. Men lack trust in a Federal Government source,    while most women tend to trust it.       Potential Solutions    Cultural strategies:      Collaborate with people who are from the    communities and speak Spanish. Community members can identify with    people who have a direct tie to their situation. Personal    interaction is very important. Testimonials from local pastors,    Hispanic celebrities, or doctors who have experienced cancer    themselves are beneficial.     Involve family members in learning about the risks and    benefits of clinical trials. Sometimes children have learned to    speak English more quickly than their parents, so they can be    helpful in translating forms and brochures. It is important to    note, however, that using children as translators has both pros    and cons. It is preferable to use someone who is trained for this    work.       Ensure that the informed consent process truly reflects    the participant's understanding of the risks and benefits of the    clinical trial. Involving family, members from the participant's    community and culturally competent staff are some ways to help    verify that the participant has received the information in a way    that he or she can understand and made the decision to participate    voluntarily.      Language strategies:      Find respectful ways to make sure that information    is understood. When people do not understand English, they may say    ""yes"" or nod, even if they do not understand what is being said.    To ensure that the person you are talking with understands what you have said, staff may ask, ""Many people have a hard time understanding information like this. I want to make sure that I explain it clearly. Could you please tell me, in your own words, what I have just said?""   When translating materials, at least two bilingual, bicultural translators should be used. In addition, materials should be pilot-tested with the target audience.       Program strategies:      Take the outreach program out to community and    neighborhood centers as well as to other sites that are already    familiar to Hispanics. Consider partnering with existing groups.       Use family-oriented, positive messages as much as    possible to offer hope.       Use radio and newspapers for outreach. Spanish-language    media-especially television and radio talk shows-are popular sources    of health-related information for many in these communities.    Printed materials with many pictures/illustrations and minimal text are preferred.                                                                                                                     Information on Other Underserved Groups    Older Adults    When considering older people and clinical trials, it is important to note that approximately 60 percent of all cancers occur in people aged 65 and older, and the number of people over age 65 is expected to double by the year 2033. The elderly are an important group to participate in clinical trials.    Because of mobility problems, transportation (including escort assistance) is one of the most important challenges specific to older people. Literacy issues (see below) are also a challenge that must be addressed when educating older adults.    Fostering positive doctor-patient interaction is another difficulty because often the older population is reluctant to question or challenge doctors and may be afraid to offend by changing doctors. This is compounded when doctors do not refer older adults to trials because of the assumption that they are too old or sick for a trial.    Older persons are more likely to be living on fixed incomes, so the financial aspects of clinical trial participation may be heightened.    The family, or other social support, is another important consideration because it is often involved in the older person's treatment and decision-making process.    It is important to inform older adults that Medicare reimburses for all routine care costs for its beneficiaries participating in clinical trials.    People with Low Literacy Skills 19    ""Many Americans face the serious problem of not being able to read or understand information. According to the 1992 National Adult Literacy Survey (NALS), some 40 to 44 million of the 191 million adults in the United States are functionally illiterate. Another 50 million are only marginally literate. Functional literacy represents more than just the ability to read. It involves reading comprehension as well as the ability to compute, communicate, write, and solve problems. These skills are especially important for patients in acquiring general information and applying it to their specific circumstances.""    ""When applied to the health system, low functional literacy translates into low health literacy. Health literacy is defined as the ability to obtain, interpret, and understand basic health information and services, as well as competence and motivation to use such information and services in ways that enhance one's health. Most health-related educational materials use simplified printed materials to convey information, assuming that people can read. Most adults do read, but many have difficulty understanding what they read and applying generalized information to their own specific situation.""    ""One common assumption is that certain populations have low levels of functional literacy. For example, traditionally ""underserved"" populations such as those with low incomes are labeled as having low levels of functional literacy simply because they are, on average, less educated. However, low functional literacy is not defined by race, class, or even educational attainment.""    Ways to Help People with Low Health Literacy Skills    ""One-on-one assistance  is the most effective technique for educating this group. In addition to helping people gain a better understanding of the clinical trial and their health needs, one-on-one assistance fosters trust between patients and the counselors or health care professionals who help them. Comprehension should be ascertained, but not by asking, ""Do you understand?"" Often the ""teach back"" method works well.""    "" Group assistance  offers an arena in which people can obtain information from educators and through the questions asked by others in the group. This technique often supplements one-on-one counseling.""    "" Visual tools  are designed to simplify concepts such as instructions for care that are too complicated to understand in written form or through verbal communication. Visual tools are particularly useful to those who cannot read at all. Videotapes may be useful tools, but follow up discussion is necessary in order to ascertain comprehension.""    Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Individuals    The lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) community is diverse in terms of cultural background, ethnic or racial identity, age, education, income, rejection or acceptance of societal stereotypes, and prejudice. As with other minority groups, discrimination and bias can play a role in inadequate medical assessment, treatment, and prevention of LGB health problems. In addition, lesbians may be at a greater risk of cancer because of issues associated with health care access, delayed or lack of childbearing, screening, and insurance.    Little information is available about specific clinical trial barriers for the LGB population. Significant barriers that must be addressed include:      Previous negative health care experiences       Fear of sexual orientation disclosure        Perceived or actual exclusion from health promotion    campaigns        Misinformation about risks and screening       Exclusion of significant others      References    1.

GX023-13-8608718	"Chapter 3               URBAN POPULATIONS:  NEEDS AND DIRECTIONS     Urban places...a melding of sights, sounds, and rhythms converging from different neighborhoods to a central core that defines the unity of this place or that. America's urbanness reflects this and more the coming together of immigrants from around the globe, some in the past and some more recently; the movement of rural residents to the city; the sharing of opportunity and work; and a vision of the future. Some of America's urban areas are small, others are large. Yet, the problems and challenges are similar, reflecting the hopes and concerns of people, wherever they congregate.     America's cities are great places of complexity and heterogeneity. Some individuals thrive here, while others despair, searching for promised opportunity. Many families enjoy full access to all that is offered, but other families do not. Health care is one resource that, too often, is not available or affordable for significant numbers of urban residents. These underserved populations thus become vulnerable to poor health as well as the poverty and disarray that already characterize their lives. In some cases, the health care that is offered to individuals is not desired because of prevailing world views or cultural beliefs. These persons, too, will not utilize the services provided and may ultimately suffer disease or illness that could have been prevented or limited.     America's urban and vulnerable populations, nevertheless, have much to offer to themselves, their communities, and society. Health care strategies that target these populations and involve them in their own health care will benefit not only individuals and families, but also whole communities. Comprehensive approaches that incorporate a community's family, work, and health values, as expressed by the individuals within the community, build on the strengths of these populations. When merged with the technical capabilities of current medicine, these strengths can bring about improved health and quality of life for all individuals and families within the community.     In this chapter, the panel presents for consideration a review of the state of the science of research on community-based health care strategies for vulnerable and underserved urban populations, identification of research needs and opportunities, and a list of specific recommendations for future research. For context, the panel first presents an overview of the health of urban America.     Overview: Health in Urban America    The Urban Environment     The terms urban or city frequently connote large metropolises, now found in all regions of the United States. While urban areas have always been sources of great complexity and diversity, the populations in these metropolises today are chal- lenged by new directions and a range and extent of problems not heretofore seen severe poverty, drug trafficking, substance abuse, high rates of homicide, violence, and homelessness.     Smaller cities are confronted by many of the same challenges and problems. In fact, as Wright (1993) suggests, these smaller cities may face greater problems because they lack a strong industrial base, have higher proportions of their popula- tions in poverty, and have a less developed welfare system.     Urban areas are usually distinguished from rural areas by the following characteristics: population size, population density, and geographic space. Compared with rural sections of the country, urban areas in general have larger and more dense populations, combining more and various social and cultural values and norms.     Populations At Risk    In urban environments, certain populations are vulnerable and underserved. It is these populations that the panel addresses in this chapter. Vulnerability implies a wide range of potential and actual health risks (Aday, 1993). Indeed, individuals and families who are most vulnerable (i.e., suffering the greatest morbidity and mortality from disease and/or the greatest discrepancy between projected needs and available services) are at risk for multiple physical and mental health problems.     Defining populations at multiple risk is often complicated by a failure to understand the interactions among factors such as poverty, class, race, ethnicity, geography, income, insurance status, education and other indicators of socioeconomic status, and social support systems in contributing to vulnerability or ameliorating against risk (Aday & Andersen, 1983). Cultural beliefs and practices also may influence risk through individuals' perceptions of health and disease as well as their utilization of health care services.     Populations facing these multiple risks include infants, children and youth, young and middle-aged adults, and elders. As members of vulnerable families and communities in closely bound urban settings, they share in the risks of the larger group. These individuals are challenged by low income and education levels and high rates of infant mortality and chronic disease. They confront infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, which is reemerging in American cities, and sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS. In some major metropolitan areas, poverty, drugs, and lifestyle contribute to making AIDS a significant killer of young adults.     In addition, although illegal drugs and alcohol have for decades been part of the urban scene, the emergence of crack cocaine as a marketable drug in poor urban neighborhoods during the 1980s has elevated drug abuse and trafficking as major health problems among vulnerable U.S. urban populations (Whitehead, Peterson, & Kaljee, 1994). The ready accessibility of crack cocaine, and now heroin, and the economic potential in selling drugs, combined with the decline in other employment opportunities for young men in these populations, have accentuated urban drug problems. A dramatic increase in violence and homicides has accompanied the increased presence of drugs and guns in urban settings.     These contemporary social problems (drugs, AIDS, violence, as well as unintended pregnancy) are proving particularly harmful to children growing up in the inner cities of America. Children are being recruited into drug trafficking as early as 9 and 10 years of age, and more inner-city children are involved in and are the victims of violence than ever before in American history.     More children are also having to cope with drug-addicted and/or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected parents. Hospital maternity wards are tending to babies born addicted to drugs or with HIV. The social, economic, and emotional burden to individuals and society of children addicted to drugs or with AIDS is difficult to estimate. Only now are the costs of special education programs for these children during their school years being realized. One can expect that these children will not become productive adult members of society, but continue to be an economic burden. Already, their care exceeds available community-based resources and they extract a heavy social and emotional toll on families and health care providers.     Community-Based Strategies in Urban Settings    Well-known community-based health care strategies used in urban settings include early public health approaches, public health departments, categorical programs targeted at particular populations or health problems, community health centers, community nursing centers, and case management services. These different strategies have evolved in response to particular social problems or to fill a gap in health care delivery. Their missions and objectives frequently include varied and differing components of community-based strategies, as conceptualized by the panel.     Public Health Departments.  Originating in the 1800s, public health departments represent a governmental response to environmental problems and infectious diseases. The infrastructure created typically provides preventive services and has been described as contributing significantly to community assessments, health screening and monitoring, and program planning. However, a recent Institute of Medicine study of public health (Institute of Medicine, 1988) calls into question whether clinical services and public health departments are viable and continuing to meet community health needs.     Categorical Programs.  As additional health and social problems were identified, governments and foundations provided funding for an increasing number of categorical programs added to the public health and medical agenda. The proliferation of Federal categorical programs is mirrored at state and local levels. These programs, not all of which are community oriented, include the Title V children's programs, the Ryan White AIDS Care bill, the McKinney Health Care for the Homeless Program, Healthy Start, Breast and Cervical Cancer Outreach and Prevention programs, and numerous mental health and substance abuse programs.     Programs such as family planning or detection and abatement of lead poisoning, which are supported by public Federal and state funds, and other categorical programs targeted at hypertension, sexually transmitted diseases, prenatal care, and immunization now dominate public health department and community-based intervention programs. Programs designed for, and limited to, specific age groups, such as infants, children, women of reproductive age, or elderly persons, are also often supported publicly. Thus, individuals, families, and communities at multiple risk are often served by a proliferation of categorical programs or by programs that have been pieced together from many categorical funding streams.     Community Health Centers.  One response to meeting the multiple health needs of individuals within small service areas, usually a single neighborhood, is the community health center. First funded in 1965, these centers provide comprehensive primary care (Sardell, 1988) for a geographically defined area. They have had some success in meeting the health needs of medically underserved populations, but have not spread to larger geographic areas for a number of reasons.     Community Nursing Centers.  Nurse-managed community centers provide nursing care that may be categorical or comprehensive. They have provided an institutional base for important nursing contributions to community-based health care (Connolly, 1991; Haas, 1992; Riesch, 1992b).     Case Management Services.  Developed in response to an increasing need to manage the quality and cost of care in the face of limited resources, case management services bridge the gaps in multiple services needed by multirisk individuals.     Challenges    Community-based strategies for underserved urban populations are faced with the same challenges as those for rural populations. Community members' involvement in these strategies and their utilization of the health care services offered will reflect the degree to which services are available, accessible, affordable, appropriate, adequate, and acceptable to the different groups in the community (Krout, 1986, 1994). For urban settings, comprised of dense populations and great diversity, these challenges are significant and their dimensions will vary for each client group.     Outcomes    Each strategy can be assessed in terms of outcomes (e.g., impact, efficacy, and effectiveness) based on the literature and experience accumulated thus far. The published literature provides direct and indirect evidence of the benefits of more recent community-based health care strategies.     Studies published in the early 1970s, for example, show a high quality of care in relationship to standards of care and clinical management protocols (Morehead & Donaldson, 1974; Morehead, Donaldson, & Seravalli, 1971); reduced use of emergency rooms among city children (Hochheiser, Woodward, & Charney, 1971); and reduced morbidity (Gordis, 1973). Compared with other providers, community health centers have been shown to reduce costs to Medicaid when these costs are controlled for patient characteristics and service mix (JRB Associates, 1981, 1982).     Because of the dearth of more recent studies of community health centers, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and Bureau of Primary Health Care adopted an ambitious evaluation strategy in 1992. Within this strategy, these organizations are sponsoring research and evaluation studies to measure case mix, processes and attributes of care, quality of care, patient satisfaction, outcomes of care, health status, and cost of care in community health centers and other federally funded comprehensive primary care systems.     A major evaluation effort pertaining to community nursing centers is under way. Mandated by the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1987, this study addresses community nursing organizations (CNOs) for Medicare members. The CNOs incorporate selected community and ambulatory services, including case management, home health, provision of durable medical equipment, and outpatient therapies, within a nurse-managed, capitated system of care (Lamb, 1995).     Four CNOs, in Arizona, Illinois, Minnesota, and New York, have enrolled approximately 10,000 participants in this study since early 1994. The evaluation design is longitudinal and experimental. Several quality and cost outcomes will be reported, including health status and health promotion activities of participants, satisfaction with health care, and use and costs of all health services. The four CNOs are using a uniform method for classifying nursing problems and will document frequency and changes in these problems.     Existing studies of the outcomes of community-based health care strategies in urban settings are deficient in several respects. They lack common conceptual and operational definitions (Bergen, 1992); they are mostly descriptive and offer only limited analysis of outcomes (Riesch, 1992a); and they have focused on small sample sizes and selected populations within noncomparable communities, thus limiting the generalizability of findings.     These limitations are further complicated by a complex design issue determining which factors influence outcomes. Comparison group, longitudinal designs, or other quasi-experimental designs are needed to clarify the relative importance of a community's context, the model of community health services used, and other factors. The separate or joint effects of community and model characteristics on outcomes have not yet been examined in the literature.     A Population Focus    In this chapter the panel addresses some of the most vulnerable and underserved populations in American cities, as defined by several key risk factors related to health and health care: income level, ethnicity and race, age, and occupation. The populations addressed are low-income individuals and families (specifically, low-income women and children), ethnic and racial minorities, the elderly, and urban workers. The panel selected these populations as examples of high-risk, vulnerable groups in urban settings; there are many other groups as well. The panel could not specifically address the community health care needs of all these groups, but aimed, through sample populations, to highlight the wide range of health needs and problems faced by all vulnerable urban populations.     Two populations on which the panel chose not to focus but which are clearly vulnerable urban populations are homeless persons and the mentally ill. Homeless persons are addressed in the literature on community health care and are the target of categorical health care interventions. However, little research has been focused on assessing the clinical services, programs, or health care strategies targeted to this population (Lukomnik, 1993).     Because of the dearth of documented information assessing health care for homeless persons, the panel was not able to review the community-based health care needs of this population in detail. It should be noted that homeless persons are not a homogeneous population, but include distinct subgroups such as Native Americans, mentally ill persons, and individuals and families marginalized from the larger society for social or economic reasons. For mentally ill persons, a vulnerable population in both urban and rural settings, major research programs are already under way and supported elsewhere.     The population focus in this chapter also reflects the orientation of studies and programs addressing the health of U.S. urban environments. The published literature largely focuses on categorically defined groups, such as homeless persons, HIV-infected individuals, and pregnant women. Intervention programs, similarly defined by diagnostic categories, focus on, for example, asthma prevention, prenatal care, and hypertension control. Outcomes are generally measured along a single dimension, such as birth outcome. And community-based interventions and programs are often initiated in response to selected health needs of a particular age group or population.     The characteristics of community-based health care strategies, described in chapter 1, are considered in assessing the state of the science and research needs and opportunities for vulnerable urban populations. Accessibility to available, affordable, appropriate, adequate, and acceptable primary health care across the full continuum of care, including primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention is as relevant to urban settings as to rural areas.                              State of the Science    Low-Income Individuals and Families    Low-income individuals and families represent a large proportion of the vulnerable and underserved populations in urban settings. Low income is a major contributing factor to poor health, affecting men, women, families, and children alike. Low income threatens the self-esteem and self-efficacy of all family members and, in association with violence, AIDS, drugs, incarceration, and low educational achievement, compromises the health of both families and individuals.     Low-income men and women of all racial and ethnic groups are vulnerable as part of this family unit. Women, especially, are vulnerable as single family providers who also are most often responsible for the care and nurturing of children and youth. In addition, some urban women are faced with an increased number of risk factors associated with low income, including violence, drug abuse, prostitution, and AIDS.     However families are defined, those with low income are less likely to use formal health care services appropriately or adequately than are families with higher incomes. Financial barriers (affordability) limit their accessibility to services, even when these services are available and acceptable. While Medicare and Medicaid are important programs for these populations, many low-income individuals and families are ineligible for Medicaid and yet do not enjoy employer-sponsored health insurance.     Without healthy families, one cannot have healthy communities and, if communities are not healthy, they do not survive as an integrating framework for socializing children to become satisfactorily functioning members of society. In this section, the panel specifically addresses low-income women and low-income children and youth as especially vulnerable and underserved urban populations. At the same time, the panel supports the need for community-based health care strategies focused on low-income families, including men as well as women, children, and youth. For this report, the panel considered related reports in family research, but did not conduct an overall, comprehensive review of this extensive body of literature.     In reviewing the state of the science specifically on low-income women and low-income children and youth, the panel notes that the needs of these two groups are often addressed by separate programs. These groups are therefore considered separately below. The panel also recognizes the need, however, for designing community-based programs that link women and their partners with their children.     Low-Income Women    Low-income women in urban settings face multiple health risks throughout the lifespan (Grisso & Watkins, 1992). Some of these risks are for diseases and conditions common in the U.S. population, which may be exacerbated by urban poverty, and some are for health problems germane to poverty, urban living, and ethnicity. Publicly funded programs have targeted certain problems (e.g., aging, AIDS, pregnancy and prenatal care), but there appear to be no well-designed, comprehensive, community-based strategies for addressing the health of low-income women across a continuum of care.     It is apparent that accessibility to health care services is a concern, as well as the affordability, appropriateness, adequacy, and acceptability of care. The behavioral and biological factors influencing these issues have yet to be delineated fully and understood. Some success has been shown with educational and focused interventions, involvement of community organizations and members, and use of lay workers. Indications are that low-income urban women would be receptive to, and would benefit from, comprehensive, appropriate, and affordable care.     Defining the Population.  The literature on low-income women focuses predominantly on women in ethnic and racial minority groups (Barbee, 1986; Benjamin & Stewart, 1989; Catchen, 1988; Nyamathi & Flaskerud, 1992) and older women (Arendell & Estes, 1991; Catchen, 1988; Dressel, 1988). Few authors have sought to clarify the bases for classifying women as low income (Gimenez, 1989) or the specific concepts for understanding low income as a designation depicting a vulnerable group (Stevens, Hall, & Meleis, 1992). In the literature, ""low income"" often is used in association with ethnicity, minority, and single heads of household.     Health Status . Most of the published studies on the health of low-income women in urban settings are descriptive. Studies of the health risks facing urban low-income women emphasize substance abuse and addiction (Ahijevych & Wewers, 1993; Barnes, Welte, & Dintcheff, 1991; Cotton, 1990; Nyamathi & Flaskerud, 1992; Reiskin & Lindenberg, 1992; Zambrana, Hernandez, Dunkel-Schetter, & Scrimshaw, 1991); sexually transmitted diseases (Abel & von Unwerth, 1988; Coker et al., 1993; Seidman, Mosher, & Aral, 1992); AIDS (Huddleston, 1995; Shayne & Kaplan, 1991; Suffet & Lifshitz, 1991); and battering or violence (Campbell & Parker, 1992).     Many of the women with these risks are minorities, pregnant, or of childbearing age, factors that further complicate the health problems they face. Isolated studies of diabetes in Mexican-American women (Luyas, 1991) and breast cancer treatment in older women (Drugay, 1992) are also available.     Factors complicating the health status of urban low-income women include the harsh environment of urban poverty and difficulty in understanding health problems and their treatment because of a low level of education (often less than high school). While some of the risks and complicating factors have been identified and studied, a comprehensive understanding of the health status and diseases or conditions of urban low-income women has not emerged a prerequisite for developing targeted health care strategies.     Use of Health Care Services.  Low-income women in urban settings are at risk for a variety of conditions (mental illness, diabetes, obesity, HIV/AIDS, and cardiovascular disease) but are less likely than women in other income groups to access health promotion and disease prevention services (e.g., prenatal, postpartum, and breast examinations, papanicolaou tests) (Berrier et al., 1991; Burks, 1992; Chavez, Cornelius, & Jones, 1986; Lacey et al., 1989; Makuc, Freid, & Kleinman, 1989; Mandelblatt, Traxler, Lakin, Kanetsky, & Kao, 1992; McCormick, Brooks, Holmes, Wallace, & Heagarty, 1992; Nickens, 1990; Whitman et al., 1991). Nonuse of screening tests is often related to lack of knowledge of the need for the tests or failure to include them in routine primary care. A few studies have examined health beliefs, including traditional beliefs, in relation to the use of these services and recommend incorporation of traditional practices with health education programs (Flaskerud & Rush, 1989; Flaskerud & Thompson, 1991; Frye, 1989-90).     Studies of the delivery of care to low-income women generally are based on small samples or local service activities and are primarily concerned with prenatal care. These studies show the following: a lower use of reproductive genetic services for women of color compared with Caucasians (Nsiah-Jefferson, 1993); delay in seeking care owing to a lack of understanding that they were pregnant and the absence of risk factors or symptoms associated with pregnancy (e.g., diabetes) (Burks, 1992); and greater use of family planning services offered by public health clinics and private physicians than those offered by voluntary organizations (Handler & Rosenberg, 1992; for rural women, Severy & McKillop, 1990). Other studies document barriers to use of prenatal services (e.g., cultural incongruence between low-income women and providers, inadequate funding for vigorous outreach, lack of community awareness of available services) (Miller, Margolis, Schwethelm, & Smith, 1989) and outreach to homeless women in shelters (Kline & Saperstein, 1992).     Regarding other concerns, such as use of mental health services in general or disease prevention services by older women, a variety of studies have examined whether physician contact results in screening (pap tests or breast exams) and whether low-income women prefer to access private or public services (Makuc et al., 1989). Findings indicate that Mexican-American women do not use public mental health centers as often as other groups (Palacios & Franco, 1986); Hispanic women use inpatient mental health services less often than do men (Russo, Amaro, & Winter, 1987); use of clinic care (vs. private private) is due most likely to the lack of a regular source of medical care and lack of insurance coverage (Radecki & Bernstein, 1989); and many Black women have coped with life-long adversity and maintain a problem-solving perspective in accessing care (Penn-Nolan, Levy, & Penn, 1986).     A few studies depict low-income women's management of health. One study shows that African American women successfully use an active psychosocial mastery process in obtaining and managing their care (Edwards, 1993). Another study shows that community low-income women who use public health department clinics for prenatal care are less likely to have preterm, low-birthweight infants than comparable women receiving private physician care (Handler & Rosenberg, 1992). With health care teams that convey acceptable attitudes and have a good multidisciplinary mix, low-income women are receptive, for example, to nurse-provided care in birthing centers (Lyons, Reinke, Sutherland, & Zelenkov, 1992).     Lia-Hoagberg et al. (1990) make an important point in urging comprehensive, coordinated, and multidisciplinary outreach and services that address psychosocial and structural barriers. In their study of 211 white, Black, and Native American low-income urban women who received adequate, inadequate, or intermediate quality prenatal care, they found that psychosocial, structural, and sociodemographic factors were barriers to care, whereas a mother's beliefs and support from others were motivators for seeking care. Overall, the authors affirm the complexity of achieving low-income women's participation in prenatal care.     Community-Based Strategies.  Community-based programs designed to serve the needs of women and their families are often supported by public funding and limit their services to targeted problems. Low-income women, who are at risk for multiple health problems, are often served by a proliferation of categorical programs or by programs pieced together from many categorical funding streams.     To facilitate describing community-based health care for low-income women, existing studies have been organized into seven broad topics: development across the life cycle; health promotion and maintenance; health care delivery; reproductive health; physical diseases and health problems; mental health and illness; and economics, ethics, policy, and legislation (McElmurry & Parker, 1993). The number and content of studies under each topic vary, indicating that research on low-income women is broad and unfocused. Few intervention studies, including nursing interventions, are reported. Some policy studies, often related to aging, offer guidance on the policies needed to enable low-income women to access health care.     Many health care practices are directed to the life cycle development of low-income women, yet low-income women are rarely a focus of research on community-based interventions for these concerns. Mothering, sexuality, families, and relationships are aspects of the life cycle addressed by health care practitioners but relatively unexamined by researchers. Practice and interventions on these and other issues across the life cycle are proceeding without benefit of an extensive base of research knowledge.     The few studies on community-based health care for low-income women across the life cycle address issues of aging such as menopause attitudes (Standing & Glazer, 1992) and aspects relevant to AIDS such as sexual behavior, sexual decision making and condom use (Fullilove, Fullilove, Haynes, & Gross, 1990; Nyamathi, Bennett, Leake, Lewis, & Flaskerud, 1993; Worth, 1989).     Positive results have been suggested for health promotion and maintenance interventions designed specifically for low-income women (Reis, Sherman, & Macon, 1989) and for interventions using lay health workers or educators as part of the health care team (McElmurry et al., 1987, 1990; McElmurry, Swider, & Norr, 1991; Sidel, 1991; Sung et al., 1992; Swider & McElmurry, 1990). Some success has been reported in using community organization or mobilization strategies to achieve health education (Braithwaite & Lythcott, 1989; Jefferson & Smith, 1985).     Some authors note that categorical programs have not been successful in inducing behavioral change (Fehrs, Hill, Kerndt, Rose, & Henneman, 1991) or providing adequate services (Whitman et al., 1991). Others report success with educational interventions (Reis et al., 1989) and expansion of services to achieve a ""one-stop-shopping"" health experience (Machala & Miner, 1991).     Much of the literature on reproductive health is concerned with family planning, including prevention of sexually transmitted diseases (McDonald & Johnson, 1995; Woods, 1995); enhancement of pregnancy outcomes for low-income women through prenatal care, outreach, and early identification of low-income pregnant women (Aved, Irwin, Cummings, & Findeisen, 1993; Brooks et al., 1989; Poland, Giblin, Waller, & Hankin, 1992); comparison of clinic, private physician, and nurse midwifery services (Handler & Rosenberg, 1992; Schimmel et al., 1992); stress reduction (Floyd, 1988); and provision of social support during pregnancy (St. Clair & Anderson, 1989). Other studies are focused on the postpartum period: counseling women to achieve success with breastfeeding (Grossman, Harter, Sachs, & Kay, 1990) and assessing women's concerns during this period (Nacion, 1988).     Most studies are focused on outcomes for infants rather than outcomes and reproductive issues for low-income women. Reproductive health studies of low-income women are limited in both breadth and depth.     The NINR currently supports a community-based nurse home visitation program to modify the health risks and lifestyle behavior of urban minority young women in relation to their pregnancy outcomes and the childhood development of their infants. This study is replicating a strategy found to be effective among young women in rural areas. Lay health workers have been shown to be effective in accomplishing prenatal outreach among rural women (Meister, Warrick, de Zapien, & Wood, 1992) and may be equally effective in urban settings.     Few studies of mental health and illness focus on urban low-income women. Areas addressed are depression, including the role of friendship (Poslusny, 1990) and psychosocial factors associated with depression (Tomes, Brown, Semenya, & Simpson, 1990), and relationships between married partners (Vega, Kolody, & Valle, 1986). Two strategies aimed at increasing one's sense of personal mastery were a prevention-oriented stress management training program (Tableman, 1989) and a counseling/vocational approach to improving one's self-concept (Texidor del Portillo, 1987). The environmental and social conditions experienced by low-income women in urban settings can be expected to increase their risk for mental illness. The literature offers a limited and unclear picture of these risks.     Studies of the economics, ethics, policy, and legislation of health care, which are not specific to urban women, have addressed the economics of women's health (unmet health needs in the areas of prenatal and preventive care), insufficiency of women's retirement pensions, need for essential mental health services, inclusion of women in clinical trials, and use of community-based inventories of homeless and addicted women to identify their health concerns (Golding, 1992; Hewitt, 1990; Hubbell, Waitzkin, Mishra, & Dombrink, 1989; Krauss, 1993; Mastroianni, Faden, & Federman, 1994; Nyamathi & Flaskerud, 1992; Thomas, 1990; Woods, 1988). These policy aspects are important to the health of low-income women in both urban and rural settings.     Low-Income Children and Youth    Increasing attention is being given to the health care needs of low-income children as the effects of poverty become clearer. Descriptive data are being accumulated and society's concern is stimulating policy discussions and action. Interventions, however, have been focused largely on selected health problems, and only limited attention has been given to determining the impact, efficacy, and cost effectiveness of these interventions. Comprehensive, community-based health care strategies have yet to be initiated or tested, and the combination of factors involved in children's accessibility to, and use of, health care services has not been fully explored.     As noted in the preceding section on low-income women, a clear definition of ""low income"" also is lacking. Although not a major impediment to the research needed, use of consistent definitions, and explanation of inconsistent definitions, would advance understanding of the relevance and impact of low income in community health care. A term frequently used is ""poverty rate,"" which is the percentage of people in any group with incomes below the poverty line.     Defining the Population.  The U.S. health care system is among the best in the world for many groups of individuals living in the United States. It is woefully inadequate, however, to meet the needs of many citizens who are children and adolescents who are poor and living in urban areas. The current health care delivery system functions best for individuals who are in middle or higher socioeconomic classes, have access to personal physicians and hospital clinics, have personal health insurance, initiate visits to health care providers, live in stable home environments with strong nurturing family support systems, and belong to the white majority population (Gelberg, Linn, Usatine, & Smith, 1990; Hu, Covell, Morgan, & Arcia, 1989). All or most of these factors do not apply to America's large population of disadvantaged urban children and adolescents.     Health Status.  Low-income children, especially in urban settings, are disproportionately represented among individuals with less-than-optimum health status (National Center for Children in Poverty, 1990). Poor children are more likely than nonpoor children to die young and to suffer from illnesses and handicapping conditions (Starfield, 1992). This excess morbidity and mortality among low-income urban children also imposes significant economic and social costs for society.     America's disadvantaged urban youth are at greater risk than the rest of the population for a range of health problems that include unintended pregnancy, AIDS and HIV infection, tuberculosis, drug abuse, and injuries associated with violence, as well as chronic illnesses, dental and dermatological problems, mental illness, and speech difficulties (Aday, 1993; Institute of Medicine, 1993; Murata, Patrick, Strehlow, & Shuler, 1992; Roth & Fox, 1990). Violence is a public health problem.     Children living in poverty are at risk of illness and dying from a wide range of causes. Infant mortality is high because of short gestation periods, low birthweight, and sudden infant death syndrome (National Center for Health Statistics, 1991). These problems are, in turn, related to maternal factors such as low maternal weight gain, obstetrical complications, infections, smoking, drugs, and lack of adequate prenatal care (Institute of Medicine, 1985).     Children from low-income households have relatively high rates of several health problems. First, infectious diseases such as influenza, meningitis, gastroenteritis, and parasitic diseases are much more prevalent among poor children than among nonpoor children (Egbuonu & Starfield, 1982). The occurrence of measles and other childhood diseases for which vaccines are available may also be high because of low levels of immunization. Second, chronic conditions, including high blood levels of lead (Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, 1988), also are prevalent among poor urban children, as are intentional and unintentional injuries.     All these health problems are related to the living conditions of poverty, particularly persistent poverty. Poor persons lack money to buy goods and services that would help them avoid infection, accidents, and injury. They often feel a loss of control over their lives and low levels of self-esteem. Many have unhealthy lifestyles that include smoking and alcohol and drug abuse, and many lack safety precautions such as smoke detectors and seat belts.     The health problems of poor children have long-range effects on their cognitive, social, and emotional development (Starfield et al., 1991). Low-birthweight children are at risk for developmental delays, particularly if they live in stressful environments. Common and easily treated problems of childhood can create important barriers to development if untreated. Otitis media, for instance, can lead to temporary or permanent hearing loss and delayed language development. Measles and other childhood diseases, for which immunizations are available, can produce permanent damage to sensory organs and neurological functioning.     Contemporary urban problems and poverty are potentially devastating for children. For example, children are being recruited into drug trafficking as early as 9 and 10 years of age (Whitehead et al., 1994). Inner-city children are both involved in and the victims of violence at higher levels than ever before in American history. In addition, more urban children are coping with parents who are addicted to drugs or infected with HIV. These problems also have far-reaching effects since they may not only dramatically reduce life expectancy rates for children, but also have long-term social effects that can affect every member of society.     Use of Health Care Services.  Poor persons sometimes underuse formal health services primarily because of cost, barriers to access, transportation difficulties, language problems, and inadequate hours of operation (Institute of Medicine, 1985). For many disadvantaged urban youth, the formal health care system and social support structures are simply not able to meet their multiple health and social needs. Comprehensive community-based interventions that involve community residents may be the only realistic solution to the health care crisis in the inner cities (Haas, 1992; Wright, 1993).     Community-Based Strategies.  Policy makers and child health researchers have argued strongly for designing effective interventions to combat the health problems of low-income urban children (Blendon, Aiken, Freeman, & Corey, 1989; Jones, 1992; Mistral, 1991). Yet, disparate funding sources continue to yield community-based interventions and programs initiated in response to selected problems or the health needs of a particular group. These programs are both focused and funded categorically through different agencies and programs.     Most recent health care initiatives emphasize the need for family-centered primary health care and an integrated approach to community health education and disease prevention programs (Farquhar et al., 1990; Graham, Johnson, Hansen, Flay, & Gee, 1990; Haas, 1992; Hancock, 1993). By expanding community-based interventions to include not only the participation of community members in the design and implementation of interventions, but also the full spectrum of care from primary prevention to secondary and tertiary prevention, strides can be made in improving the health status of high-risk children in urban areas. Given the limited resources available and the wide range of problems to be addressed, interventions must produce the desired outcomes and be cost effective (Becker et al., 1992).     One of the great advantages of community-based health care strategies is that they enable researchers and practitioners to address the entire context of health care problems. This context includes socioeconomic and cultural factors that may contribute to, or protect against, illness and disease, as well as the interplay among individuals, families, communities, and health care providers. The ability to address this broad context is especially important in treating the health care needs of disadvantaged urban youth which are usually inextricably connected with a host of other factors (Pivnick, Jacobson, Eric, Doll, & Drucker, 1994; Schorr, 1988).     For example, recent studies show close associations between family environments and health problems from violence and drug abuse and risk of AIDS (Berkowitz, Halfon, & Klee, 1992; Engelke & Engelke, 1992; Pivnick et al., 1994). Other studies related to contextual factors show that community attitudes toward health care professionals and the larger society play an important role in an individual's actions regarding health care (Erkel, 1985a, 1985b; Rowley & Tosteson, 1993).     Studies of community-based health care strategies for low-income children have focused on categorical programs (e.g., HIV, substance use, Title V, Healthy Start), governmental funding, and the need for restructuring health care delivery systems (Klerman, 1991; Koplin, 1993; Shea, Basch, Lantigua, & Wechsler, 1992; Sundwall & Tavani, 1991). Much of this literature has focused on health service needs, and only limited attention has been given to determining the impact and efficacy of programs (Engelke & Engelke, 1992; Marcenko & Smith, 1992).     Some of the most exciting recent work, which has applicability to interventions targeted at low-income children as well as other groups, has focused on defining a target community (Assaf, Banspach, Lasater, McKinlay, & Carleton, 1987; Becker et al., 1989; Farquhar et al., 1990; Fisher, Auslander, Sussman, Owens, & Jackson-Thompson, 1992). For example, some studies suggest that the family-centered strategy needs to be supplemented with a larger concept of community that includes extended family and nonfamily groups (Dubowitz, 1994; Fisher et al., 1992).     Other studies show that collaboration between health care providers and church groups has great promise as a community-based nursing intervention (Levine et al., 1992; McDermott & Burke, 1993; Stillman, Bone, Rand, Levine, & Becker, 1993), as does involvement of a variety of peer groups (Julnes, Konefal, Pindur, & Kim, 1994; Levine et al., 1992; Meister et al., 1992; Quirk, Godkin, & Schwenzfgeier, 1993). In several cases, use of nonprofessional community members has been shown to be effective (Meister et al., 1992; Mittelmark et al., 1986; Quirk et al., 1993; Stillman et al., 1993).     In addition, several culturally specific programs incorporating the attitudes and practices of ethnic populations seem to show promise in not only educating inner-city youth about health care problems, but also involving them in the solutions to these problems (Campinha-Bacote, 1991; Hong, Kappel, Whitlock, Parks-Thomas, & Freedman, 1994; Hu, Keller, & Fleming, 1989; Julnes et al., 1994; Thomas & Quinn, 1993). The culturally specific programs are addressing both specific health care needs and the contextual and social problems encompassing them.     The NINR currently supports several promising community-based interventions targeted to urban youth. Three studies are addressing health promotion among adolescents and the influence of violence. Another study is testing risk behavior interventions to prevent AIDS.     Ethnic and Racial Minorities    Ethnicity and race are additional risk factors that add complexity to the profile of urban underserved and vulnerable populations, a profile that includes low income, low education levels, and low economic opportunity. For ethnic and racial minorities, this profile is complicated by the strengths that these populations offer in their family, health, and work values which may be important, positive factors in their health care factors that, too often, are overlooked if one focuses only on socioeconomic factors (Hayes-Bautista, 1992).     Addressed below is the state of the science of community-based health care strategies for three vulnerable and underserved ethnic and racial minority groups: African Americans, Asian and Pacific Islander Americans, and Latinos. Within these broad population classifications are many diverse, heterogeneous subpopulations that continue to enrich the American landscape. As these minorities become an increasing part of the U.S. population, their health care needs and contributions deserve closer attention.     Minority groups in the United States experience many of the same diseases affecting all Americans and may have special needs or conditions related to particular sociocultural or environmental factors. Their risk for certain diseases is often disproportionately higher than the white population, reflecting socioeconomic and/or cultural factors that influence their use of health care services. Accessibility to health care services is a common problem, relating to geography and socio- economic status, and affordability (i.e., availability of insurance) is a problem for many.     Although culturally relevant health care seems imperative, few investigators have examined the appropriateness, adequacy, or acceptability of care among these populations. Similarly, the need for and use of a continuum of services, from preventive to restorative care, have received little attention.     In the sections below, the panel describes, for each of the three major groups, population data, major health problems, use of health care services, and community-based health care strategies. The information presented is not intended to be exhaustive, but to characterize the state of the science in each area.     African Americans    Defining the Population.  Although African Americans are often perceived as a homogeneous group, the population is very diverse. Notable differences are based on country of origin, religion, socioeconomic status (income and education levels and occupation), area of residence, and regional origin.     Most African Americans are native-born Americans of African ancestry. However, in recent years, there has been significant immigration from several Caribbean and African countries to major U.S. metropolitan areas. Some researchers suggest that, regardless of country of origin, both native and foreign-born African Americans tend to share common beliefs, attitudes, and values (Dixon, 1994; Randall-Davis, 1989; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1985) and that the experience of being black in America has produced sentiments that have evolved into a sense of ""peoplehood"" among most African Americans (Dixon, 1994; Hatch, Moss, Saran, Presley-Cantrell, & Mallory, 1993; Randall-Davis, 1989; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1985).     African Americans reside in all regions of the United States, with a majority living in the southernmost regions of the country (Dixon, 1994; Randall-Davis, 1989; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1985). About 23 percent live within small metropolitan areas, 19 percent live in rural settings, and nearly 59 percent live in central cities where they are often challenged by significant environmental hazards, including pollution, substandard and overcrowded housing, crime, violence, and generally high levels of stress (Dixon, 1994; Randall-Davis, 1989; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1985).     African Americans are represented in every socioeconomic group; however, they are more likely than the majority population to be unemployed and unskilled and to live within a household with an earned income below the Federal poverty line. National data show that one in three African Americans lives in a family whose income falls below the Federal poverty level, compared with one in every eight Americans overall (Mosbacher, 1991; U.S. Public Health Service, 1990). African Americans in the workforce are highly concentrated in blue collar and service-related occupations and are consistently underrepresented in management and professional occupations (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1985).     Health Status.  Despite the many strides made in the capacity to diagnose, cure, and control disease, the health condition of African Americans lags far behind that of the total population. African Americans have a higher risk of disease and premature death than any other group living in the United States (Abraham, 1993; Dixon, 1994; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1985; U.S. Public Health Service, 1990).     The disparities suffered by African Americans were described by the Secretary's Task Force on Black and Minority Health in the mid-1980s as persistent, distressing, and excessive (Bowles & Robinson, 1989; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1985). Data indicate that the leading causes of death among African Americans are the same as for the total population, but African Americans suffer disproportionately from cancer, cardiovascular disease and stroke, chemical dependency, diabetes, homicide and unintentional injuries, infant mortality and low birthweight, and HIV infection (Dixon, 1994; Hildreth & Saunders, 1991; National Center for Health Statistics, 1993; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1985; U.S. Public Health Service, 1990).     The life expectancy of African Americans also lags behind that of the overall population. For African Americans, their life expectancy is currently 69.4 years and falling, compared with 75 years for the overall population (Abraham, 1993; Dixon, 1994; National Center for Health Statistics, 1993; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1985; U.S. Public Health Service, 1990).     The disparities in health and longevity among African Americans are said to result from a number of factors, including lifestyle preferences, habits and behaviors, many social- and economically related risk factors, diagnostic limitations, and treatment limitations (Abraham, 1993; Dixon, 1994; Snow, 1993; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1985; U.S. Public Health Service, 1990). The combined effect of economic disadvantage, medical disadvantage, and indigenous cultural factors often impedes access to many health care services and resources (Abraham, 1993; Dixon, 1994; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1985; U.S. Public Health Service, 1990).    Use of Health Care Services.  Statistics demonstrate with sharp clarity that African Americans do not receive enough early, routine, and preventive health care. They often reside in areas not near formal medical services, are unable to pay for care in largely fee-for-service medical systems, are frustrated by recurring incidents of discrimination and abuse, and lack sufficient insurance to cover health care costs. In relation to these factors, African Americans are often described, in comparison with others, as having become more tolerant of illness and disease; less reliant on Western medicine; and less likely to utilize ambulatory, inpatient, and extended care facilities for emergent care or other health-related conditions (Abraham, 1993; Bailey, 1989; Dixon, 1994; Lewin-Epstein, 1991; Snow, 1993).     Health care services research data confirm that, compared with other populations, African Americans often have no usual source of medical care and reportedly make fewer annual visits to a physician. As a result, hospital emergency rooms or hospital clinics tend to be their most common source of medical care (Abraham, 1993; Bailey, 1989; Dixon, 1994; National Center for Health Statistics, 1993; U.S. Public Health Service, 1990).     Given current knowledge of disease prevention, health promotion, risk reduction, early detection, and treatment, the health status and longevity of Africans Americans could be significantly enhanced in spite of these disparities (U.S. Depart- ment of Health and Human Services, 1985; U.S. Public Health Service, 1990). If health care were made more available, affordable, acceptable, and accessible, many diseases could be prevented and many deaths could be avoided (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1985; U.S Public Health Service, 1990).     Community-Based Strategies.  National health care efforts have failed to reduce the health care burden of African Americans. However, an increasing body of research suggests that community-based health care strategies can be effective in promoting health and wellness among this population (National Center for Health Statistics, 1993; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1985; U.S Public Health Service, 1990).     Drawing on as many aspects of community life as possible, community-based health care strategies have proven to be successful in bridging gaps within the health care system. By carefully designing culturally sensitive programs that emphasize health promotion, risk reduction, early detection, and early treatment of disease primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention in a supportive community environment, the health, health behaviors, and health outcomes of African Americans can be positively influenced (Braithwaite, Murphy, Lythcott, & Blumenthal, 1989; Brooks, Smith, & Anderson, 1991; Kipke, Montgomery, & MacKenzie, 1993; Molbert, Boyer, & Shafer, 1993; U.S. Public Health Service, 1990).     The challenge faced by health care professions has been to design health care strategies that maximize effectively the potential for community participation in health-related initiatives (Kipke, Montgomery, et al., 1993; Schneider, Greenberg, & Choi, 1993; U.S. Public Health Service, 1990). The literature contains numerous reports by nurses and other professionals describing strategies of care developed to address many of the health care needs of African Americans and other underserved populations.     Most notable among these reports are strategies to reduce the health disparities of African Americans by implementing interventions focused specifically on reducing infant mortality and low birthweight; prevention and early detection of cancer; promotion of physical activities; AIDS education, prevention, and risk reduction; reducing substance abuse; prevention of coronary heart disease; and, coordination of health care services and resources (Baranowski et al., 1990; Eng, 1993; Holland, Foster, & Louria, 1993; Holman, Jenkins, Gayle, Duncan, & Lindsey, 1991; Kipke, Boyer, & Hein, 1993; Kipke, Montgomery, et al., 1993; Lacey, 1993; Lacey et al., 1989, 1993; Lacey, Tukes, Manfredi, & Warnecke, 1991; Mitchell & Daniels, 1989; Molbert et al., 1993; Nyamathi & Flaskerud, 1992; Pearson, Jenkins, & Thomas, 1991; Rubin & Black, 1992; Smith, 1989; Suarez, Nichols, & Brady, 1993; U.S. Public Health Service, 1990).     Many of these strategies targeted to the African American community have attempted to engage health-oriented institutions peripheral to the community in developing community-based health care systems (Bowles & Robinson, 1989; Fletcher & Himburg, 1991; Kang & Bloom, 1993; Mitchell & Daniels, 1989; Rudolph, Kahan, & Bordeu, 1993). Other community-based health care strategies utilize community settings that are more engaged in the community's social structure, such as religious institutions, housing units, community centers, and civic centers, as points of access to this population (Baranowski et al., 1990; Eng, 1993; Holman et al., 1991; Kipke, Boyer, et al., 1993; Kipke, Montgomery, et al., 1993; Lacey, 1993; Lacey et al., 1989, 1991, 1993; Mitchell & Daniels, 1989; Molbert et al., 1993; Nyamathi & Flaskerud, 1992; Pearson et al., 1991; Rubin & Black, 1992; Smith, 1989; Thomas, Quinn, Billingsley, & Caldwell, 1994).     Reports highlighting the impact of these two types of strategies demonstrate that involving institutions perceived as being outside the community often fails to achieve optimal involvement and that far greater participation is gained by involving settings that are frequented by large numbers of persons in the community and that play a strong role in community life (Bowles & Robinson, 1989; Fletcher & Himburg, 1991; Kang & Bloom, 1993; Lacey, 1993; Lacey et al., 1991, 1993; Mitchell & Daniels, 1989; Rudolph et al., 1993; Smith, 1989). However, little comparative research has been reported on the impact of these strategies across various points of access.     Also highlighted in the literature are community-based health care strategies that have addressed the health needs of African American communities through incorporation of natural helpers, peer role models, lay health educators, informants, and other persons indigenous to the community into the health care team (Dignan et al., 1990; Eng, 1993; Lacey et al., 1991; Rubin & Black, 1992; Suarez et al., 1993). The increased familiarity of these individuals with African American lifestyles, values, and beliefs has been suggested as making them uniquely qualified to serve in this capacity.     Research suggests that involvement of persons indigenous to the community in community outreach, health promotion, and health education facilitates the organization, motivation, and mobilization of clients within the African American community (Bowles & Robinson, 1989; Fletcher & Himburg, 1991; Kang & Bloom, 1993; Lacey, 1993; Lacey et al., 1991, 1993; Mitchell & Daniels, 1989; Rudolph et al., 1993; Smith, 1989). Their use of techniques and strategies that ""model"" behaviors familiar to persons within the community has been shown to be consoling for those struggling with serious life problems (Dignan et al., 1990; Eng, 1993; Lacey et al., 1991; Rubin & Black, 1992; Suarez et al., 1993).     However, the ability of these individuals to encourage sustained participation and to improve health, health care, and health outcomes substantially has yet to be demonstrated. Similarly, methods for measuring the effectiveness of community-based interventions are inadequate, and data on effectiveness, including cost effectiveness, are lacking.     Asian and Pacific Islander Americans     Defining the Population . Asian and Pacific Islander Americans (APIAs) are a diverse, heterogeneous group of individuals who speak different languages and have different cultures. Residents of the United States, they or their parents or grand- parents come from Asia and the Pacific Islands, which include countries in the Indian subcontinent (e.g., India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka), Southeast Asia (e.g., Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, Philippines, Indone- sia), East Asia (e.g., Japan, China, Korea), and the Pacific Islands (e.g., Fiji, Micronesia, Tonga, Samoa, Hawaii).     Although specific projections differ, APIAs are considered one of the fastest growing minority groups in the United States. The APIA population in the United States is projected to reach between 17.9 and 20.2 million by 2020 (Ong & Hee, 1993). The Bureau of the Census (1992) expects APIAs to reach 10.7 percent of the U.S. population by 2050.     Health Status.  The health issues confronting APIAs have not been defined adequately. Neither the Healthy People 2000 policy guidelines (U.S. Public Health Service, 1990) nor the Federal report on Health Status of Minorities and Low-Income Groups (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1991) provides satisfactory data on APIA health issues, particularly if one views health as a multidimensional concept in which physical, social, mental, environmental, and economic aspects are important. Errors and inconsistencies in identifying APIAs add to the problem (Yu & Liu, 1992). Despite the limited data available, some important findings have emerged.     Lin-Fu (1993) summarizes existing literature on APIA health problems. Two infectious diseases are of grave importance: hepatitis B and tuberculosis. Hepatitis B is of particular concern in new immigrants from Southeast Asia where the problem is widespread. Infants born to mothers infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) are at high risk of acquiring HBV infection and of remaining chronically infected (Arevalo & Washington, 1988; Centers for Disease Control, 1988; both cited by Lin-Fu, 1993). As noted by Lin-Fu (1993), chronic infection with HBV contributes to primary hepatoma and cirrhosis.     Tuberculosis also occurs with greater frequency among Southeast Asian refugees (Centers for Disease Control, 1991; Powell, Brown, & Farer, 1983; both cited by Lin-Fu, 1993). Unfortunately, many APIAs are infected with drug-resistant tuberculosis strains.     Important genetic problems are alpha- and beta-thalassemia and hemoglobin E (an abnormal hemoglobin). According to Choi and Necheles (1983, cited in Lin-Fu, 1993), about 5 percent of Chinese Americans in Boston are carriers of alpha- and beta-thalassemia. Hemoglobin E is found in 30 million people, mostly Southeast Asians, a large number of whom have immigrated to the United States, greatly increasing U.S. incidence (Ferguson & O'Reilly, 1985). Crocker (1985, cited in Lin-Fu, 1993) states that 28 percent of Laotians and 26 percent of Cambodians are carriers of hemoglobin E. Rowley, Loader, Sutera, and Walden (1987, cited in Lin-Fu, 1993) report that 14 percent of Southeast Asians in Rochester, New York, are carriers of hemoglobinopathy. Lactase deficiency also is common among APIAs (Lin-Fu, 1993).     Cancer is a serious problem among native Hawaiians, who have the highest incidence of cancer of the stomach, breast, corpus uteri, and ovaries and the second highest incidence of lung cancer in the United States. Stomach cancer also is high among Japanese Americans, whereas liver cancer is high among Chinese Americans (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1986, as cited by Lin-Fu, 1993). Other notable health problems include nocturnal death (sudden death) in seemingly healthy young people, particularly Hmong and Laotians (Lin-Fu, 1987); cardiovascular disease (Chen, 1993b); and smoking (Centers for Disease Control, 1992).     Use of Health Care Services.  Data on APIA use of health care services and the factors involved in their use of these services are very limited. Affordability is a major problem. Since 1990, more than 60 percent of the APIA population in the United States comprises foreign-born immigrants, many of whom are on welfare (Ong & Hee, 1993). More than 25 percent of APIAs have no health insurance (National Center for Health Statistics, 1991). These conditions pose barriers to health care services use. Information is lacking on the use of health care services by uninsured APIAs.     Accessibility is another problem. Hafner-Eaton (1993) reports that Asians have considerably less access to the American health care system than other groups, even when controlling for insurance and health and income status. In addition to lack of funds, other barriers to receiving timely care are language problems, location of services, and psychological barriers (True, 1985). Common psychological barriers among APIA groups are fear of hospitalization, fear of intrusive procedures, and preference for traditional medicine and healers (Lasky & Martz, 1993).     APIAs also commonly underutilize mental health services (Matsuoka, 1990), a finding that does not necessarily correlate with less severe conditions. As with general health care, proper utilization of mental health services is influenced by location, availability, and cultural and linguistic appropriateness of services (Sue, 1993).     The diversity among APIA cultures makes it difficult to generalize about primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention practices across APIA groups. Lasky and Martz (1993) explain that although traditional APIAs engage in health practices to prevent illness, they may do so in non-Western ways. In the case of traditional Pilipinos, for example, prevention practices may include maintaining a balance of spirit, morals, body elements, and diet (Baysa, Cabrera, Camilon, & Torres, 1980). That is, rapid shifts from hot to cold are avoided. Air imbalances, such as allowing wind to blow on the body, are avoided to prevent illnesses such as colds, fever, and pneumonia. Being a morally good person is desirable so that one deserves to have good things happen. Emotional stress can cause disequilibrium and, subsequently, greater susceptibility to illness.     Pilipinos, following their traditional prevention practices, also underutilize health care services (Baysa et al., 1980). They may suppress signs of suffering in front of strangers, are more expressive within the family, and may not seek treatment or accept hospitalization in a timely manner (Lasky & Martz, 1993).     Community-Based Strategies.  Not knowing the extent of the potential or real health problems of APIAs makes it difficult to design community-based health care strategies that address the physical and mental health care needs of APIAs (Guillermo, 1993; Sue, 1993). Also, many health care providers do not understand the important role of culture in the lifestyles and health behaviors of these groups (Andrews, 1992; Lin-Fu, 1993). In addition, health providers may not recognize disease or illness conditions in this population. For example, Pilipinos with mental illness may seek treatment for headaches, insomnia, dizziness, or fatigue (Lasky & Martz, 1993).     Few studies have assessed or tested health-related intervention programs for APIAs (Chen, 1993a) or community-based health care strategies for APIAs. Chen (1993a) explains that current data are insufficient to assess the extent to which objective 8.11 of the Healthy People 2000 document has been met for the APIA population (U.S. Public Health Service, 1990). This objective addresses the need for a 50 percent increase in the proportion of counties with culturally and linguistically appropriate health promotion programs for racial and ethnic minority populations (e.g., APIAs).     Recent national health surveys shed some light on the availability of community-based programs for APIAs. The Asian American Health Forum conducted a national survey of health promotion and disease prevention programs available through APIA community-based organizations or public entities (Guillermo, 1993). The survey revealed that 62 percent of the organizations had some health programs for APIAs. Most of these programs targeted HIV/AIDS; other programs focused on infectious diseases, mental health, nutrition, and substance abuse. Health education was the most frequent type of service delivered, followed by screening, counseling, research, and primary care (Guillermo, 1993).     A survey of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (1992) in the United States revealed that only 26 percent of respondents felt that linguistically appropriate service delivery is of high priority. The respondents also reported that bilingual/bicultural services were not offered uniformly across service programs. Those that were offered dealt with sexually transmitted diseases, HIV/AIDS, immunization, tuberculosis, and maternal and child health programs. In summary, national data indicate that current community-based programs for APIAs are inadequate for the health care needs of these groups (Guillermo, 1993).     The NINR is currently supporting several community-based interventions aimed at controlling the reemergence of tuberculosis, preventing transmission of the disease, and promoting adherence to treatment. These studies include intervention strategies for ethnic and racial minorities infected with tuberculosis.     Latinos     Defining the Population.  The Latino population is the fastest growing minority group in the United States. Between 1981 and 1991, the U.S. Latino population increased at a rate of 4.1 percent per year, reaching 23,350,000 in 1991. As a percentage of the national population, persons of Latino origin increased from 6.8 to 9.3 percent during the decade (Bureau of the Census, 1993). It is projected that, by 2010, Latinos are expected to total 39 million or 12.9 percent of the U.S. population (Exter, 1992) and will be one of the fastest growing minority groups. In the next 20 years, the number of Latinos between the ages of 45 and 54 will more than double and the number of women older than 75 will triple (Biafora & Longino, 1990; Exter, 1992).     The Latino population in the United States includes four main groups: Mexicans (63 percent of the U.S. Latino population), Puerto Ricans (12 percent), Cubans (5 percent), South and Central Americans (10 percent), and other Latinos (8 percent) (National Coalition of Hispanic Health and Human Services Organizations, 1988). Participation in the U.S. health care system differs among Latinos based on group of origin and/or identification, duration of residency in the United States, and income.     Health Status.  The prevalence of certain diseases varies among Latino groups (Mendoza et al., 1991). Compared with whites, Latinos are more likely to have diabetes, hypertension, AIDS, alcoholism, specific cancers, and violent deaths (Council on Scientific Affairs, 1991). In a nationally representative sample of Mexican, Cuban, and Puerto Rican Americans (National Center for Health Statistics, 1985), Latinos of Mexican descent were at highest risk for hypertension and cardiovascular disease (Pappas, Gergen, & Carroll, 1990).     Risk factors among Latinos include excessive alcohol intake, obesity, use of processed food, and stress (Bray & Edwards, 1991). Yet, despite the high incidence of cardiovascular disease, especially among Mexicans, mortality from this condition is reported to be low. Culture may serve as a buffer for individuals at risk for heart attacks (Chrisman & Kleinman, 1983).     Still, mortality from heart attacks is expected to increase among Latinos, especially for those with untreated hypertension. This expected increase is mostly due to the lack of cultural value Latinos have for Western preventive health care practices and certain treatment regimens for diseases such as hypertension and obesity (Chrisman, 1984). The fact is that clinical symptoms of hypertension can go undetected for a long period of time, and adherence to treatment is an issue among all patient populations.     For inner-city, underrepresented populations, these problems are compounded by poverty, low education, inability to read or speak English or functional illiteracy in English, inability to follow a prescribed regimen, and, for economic or cultural reasons, inability to seek health care (Francis, 1991). It also has been reported that Latinos are less likely to be willing to be hospitalized for their illnesses (Welch, Comer, & Steinman, 1973). If preventive health care behaviors and adherence to hypertension treatment regimens are not valued by Latinos as they are by the majority white population, the chances for severe cardiovascular complications are more likely to increase.     Among Latinos, Puerto Ricans have the highest incidence of diabetes and are twice as likely to have used cocaine (National Center for Health Statistics, 1985). Puerto Rican women also are more likely to smoke cigarettes, increasing their risk for pulmonary and other related diseases (National Center for Health Statistics, 1985).     Use of Health Care Services.  Latinos tend to delay seeking medical care. Reasons include underinsurance or no insurance (Lieu, Newacheck, & McManus, 1993) and social or cultural factors such as language barriers, health beliefs and practices, perceived health care needs, and use of home remedies and traditional healers (Andersen, Giachello, & Aday, 1986; Lukomnik, 1993).     Analysis of a study conducted by the National Access Survey between 1982 and 1986 revealed that twice as many Latinos as whites have no regular source of health care (Weisfeld, 1987). Of the three major Latino groups in the United States, Mexicans are least likely to have routine physical examinations or to see a physician regularly (Warner, 1991). Elderly Latinos rely on extended family members for support and care (Ailinger, Dear, & Holley-Wilcox, 1993).     Although lack of access to health care services is not a problem unique to Latinos, they are less likely in comparison with other minority groups, such as African Americans, to use these services (Trevi¤o & Moss, 1984). Lack of access and inability to qualify for health services are posing major problems for medical institutions, which are reporting increased use of hospital emergency rooms by Latinos as a way of receiving health care.     This phenomena can be attributed to several factors: (1) lack of resources available in the community to assist Latinos in becoming socialized with the culture of health and to assist providers in becoming socialized to Latinos' culture of health; (2) lack of value for preventive health care; (3) inability to pay for health services; and (4) lack of homogeneous sociocultural knowledge about this group.     A mutual understanding of concepts relating to the health values, beliefs, and culture of the majority and Latino populations is pivotal to the success of health services. Examination and testing of the adequacy and acceptability of health care practices delivered to Latinos also are imperative. For example, a group of Puerto Rican parents who had children with cancer reported feeling more comfortable talking to a nurse about their concerns and fears about childhood cancer than to a psychologist. Psychologists were believed to be necessary only when people were ""mentally ill"" by this group of parents (Munet-Vilar¢, 1984). Existing scientific data about health values and the utilization of these data in delivering services to Latinos are random, anecdotal, and limited.     Community-Based Strategies.  For Latinos, as for other populations, social constructs and cultural beliefs influence their health behaviors and health-seeking practices. These beliefs and practices, which may protect or impede health, must be considered when devising community-based health care strategies.     For example, differing from the majority white U.S. population, Latinos place extreme importance on ""la familia"" (the family), highly value ""respeto"" (respect) for authority figures, prefer to develop interpersonal relationships based on trust and ""personalismo"" (personalism), and believe that every individual has a life mission (fate) that cannot be altered (Perez-Stable, 1987; Sabogal, Marin, Otero-Sabogal, Marin, & Perez-Stable, 1987). Some of these characteristics may explain why Latinos tend to delay seeking formal medical care when needed.     The authors of one study comparing the beliefs and attitudes of Anglos and Latinos reported that Latinos believed that bruises from being hit, sugar substitutes, microwave ovens, breastfeeding, spicy foods, and antibiotics could cause cancer (Perez-Stable, Sabogal, Otero-Sabogal, Hiatt, & McPhee, 1992). The Latinos in this study were also more likely to believe that cancer is a death sentence and to prefer not to know that they have it.     In addition, use of traditional healers for specific illnesses, especially those caused by ""bad spirits"" are still part of the care-seeking health behaviors of some Latinos. Some Mexicans use ""curanderos"" and folk healers; some Puerto Ricans seek care from ""espiritistas"" (Giachello, 1985). While these services are sought primarily by new immigrants who believe that Western medicine is not effective, many Latinos use home remedies such as herbal teas and baths along with conventional Western medical treatment such as chemotherapy for cancer (Munet-Vilar¢, 1984). These practices may be conducted without the knowledge of nurses and doctors because the persons fear being ridiculed.     Data on the impact, efficacy, and cost effectiveness of established or innovative health care services for Latinos are limited. Community-based interventions have been shown to be successful among Latinos and may eventually decrease the cost of care when a partnership with the community to be served includes members of the community as well as culturally sensitive health professionals (Mahon, McFarlane, & Golden, 1991; Milburn, 1993).     For example, in an Arizona suburban community of Latino migrant workers, lay health workers were trained and used in a community-based prenatal intervention project (Meister et al., 1992). Incorporating sociocultural factors, the program included use of Spanish, community lay workers as ""promotoras"" (health promoters), the indigenous system for delivering health education, and a support network of health care professionals. The use of lay workers as a community resource proved to be one of the most successful strategies in this cost-effective program. Information from this study can be extrapolated to other Latino communities.     Community-based health care for Latinos can work if culturally appropriate strategies are used. A cancer detection and prevention program designed to reach underserved and poor Latino and black communities in Dade County, Florida, was successful due to the strategies used (Zavertnik, 1993). For example, Spanish newspapers and Latino radio stations were used to reach the public, informing them about cancer prevention services such as mammograms. Listeners also were able to call with questions during an interview program offered by the radio stations.     Other successful strategies in this program included informal talks and networking at elderly meal sites in senior citizen centers, presentations to church groups and organizations, and puppet presentations at Head Start Sites. A signifi- cant change in in situ and local stage of disease was observed among the group that was screened, in comparison with the un- screened group. Financial savings also were reported to be significant when compared with the costs of cancer treatment.                              Urban Elderly    Elderly persons offer a rich resource of experience and knowledge on which society can draw. Many continue to live with vigor well into their 80s or beyond, yet others suffer illness and disability. Constituting a growing segment of the American population, elders utilize a significant percentage of the country's health care resources. Comprehensive, community-based programs have much to offer elderly persons at risk, especially low-income frail elderly. Creative solutions that capitalize on existing resources in both rural and urban areas are sorely needed.     Ensuring that health care is available, accessible, affordable, appropriate, adequate, and acceptable to all elderly persons, including the frail elderly, requires community-based health care strategies that include codetermination of health care intervention strategies among consumers, nurses, physicians, and other health care professionals. Careful attention also must be given to including elders in decision making about their health care to ensure that their concerns about their quality of life are incorporated into the strategies adopted.     Defining the Population.  Persons aged 65 and older represent about 12 percent of the U.S. population (U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging, 1991). This proportion is expected to increase to between 18 and 20 percent by 2030 (Board of Trustees, 1994).     Health Status.  Aggregate data on the health status and costs associated with health care for elderly Americans are startling. Although elderly persons comprise about 12 percent of the U.S. population, they account for 31 percent of all hospital discharges, 42 percent of all short-stay hospital days, and more than 34 percent of the country's total health care expenditures (U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging, 1991). The projected increase in the proportion of elders over the next 40 years is likely to be accompanied by substantial increases in total health spending.     The average annual number of days of restricted activities due to acute and chronic conditions for persons aged 65 and older in 1990 was 31.4 (i.e., 1 month out of every year is lost to illness and frailty), of which 2 weeks, on average, are spent confined to bed (National Center for Health Statistics, 1992). Further, nearly 32 percent of persons aged 75 years and older report their health as ""fair"" or ""poor"" (National Center for Health Statistics, 1992).     The health needs and costs for elderly persons are influenced by a myriad of social issues, including housing, transportation, and fixed incomes. Older persons have substantially less cash income than those under 65, and the old-old (85 years of age and older) have significantly lower money incomes than the young-old (65 to 74 years of age) (U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging, 1988). Further, the median income of elderly women is slightly more than half (56 percent) the median income of elderly men (U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging, 1988).     Elderly persons living in urban areas face special challenges. Although urban areas have greater numbers and types of health care services and more rapid introduction of new technologies than rural areas, urban elderly face different access problems, including those related to transportation and sociodemographic factors (Prospective Payment Assessment Commission, 1993, 1994).     Use of Health Care Services.  Elderly Americans today consume a disproportionate share of the nation's health care resources in part due to the availability of Medicare and supplemental insurance and the acute and highly technical services required to care for exacerbations of multiple chronic conditions. Currently, 96 percent of adults 65 or older are enrolled in Medicare (Prospective Payment Assessment Commission, 1994). Per capita health care expenditures for people in this age group are almost double those for 45- to 64-year-olds and almost 4 times the average for individuals aged 18 to 44 (Prospective Payment Assessment Commission, 1994).     However, as a consequence of health insurance coverage lagging behind use patterns and the inflation of medical care prices, out-of-pocket health care expenses by elderly persons now comprise the same proportion of their incomes as prior to the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid (U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging, 1988). More than 26 percent of persons age 85 years and older have only Medicare for their health insurance coverage (National Center for Health Statistics, 1992).     Many elderly persons have special needs for social support associated with loss of spouse and friends, reduced physical capacity to engage in usual social activities, lower cognitive function, and clinical depression which is often a reaction to frailty, chronic disease, and other losses. These social support needs cannot be overlooked: Only about 5 percent of elderly persons live in nursing homes at any given time; relatives represent 84 percent of all caregivers and provide 89 percent of all days of care for disabled elderly men living in the community (U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging, 1988).     Community-Based Strategies.  A variety of community-based intervention strategies have been used to prevent disease, promote health, and provide supportive and restorative health care among elderly persons residing in urban settings. Examples of these interventions are given below to highlight the state of the science and to point to research needs and opportunities. Many of them may be applicable to rural areas and diverse population groups.     Primary and Secondary Prevention    Many diseases of older adults cancer, cardiovascular disease, pulmonary diseases, stroke/cerebrovascular disease, and unintentional injuries stem from long-term habits that undermine health inactivity, alcohol abuse, physical abuse, psychological abuse, high-fat/low-fiber diets, and poor compliance with recommended prevention and disease-screening protocols (Berg & Cassells, 1990; Sattin, 1992; Surgeon General, 1993; Tinetti, Speechley, & Ginter, 1988). These diseases and habits are common to both urban and rural older adults.     Primary and secondary prevention strategies, when placed within a comprehensive health care outreach and service delivery system, offer ways of reducing the risks and effects of these diseases through health promotion, disease prevention and screening, and early diagnosis and treatment. Through health promotion one aspect of primary prevention it is possible to modify elderly persons' high-risk behaviors such as smoking, excessive alcohol intake, and lack of physical activity. An increase in ""protective"" activities, such as exercise and making environmental changes for safety, is also possible. Immunizations another aspect of primary prevention can reduce elderly persons' risk for upper respiratory infections, such as influenza and pneumonia. Screening for cancer or other serious diseases secondary prevention can identify early signs of diseases that increase with age.     For these and other primary and secondary prevention services, community-based strategies offer an appropriate public health context that can have major benefit for elderly persons throughout the United States. Such strategies include health fairs that offer a wide range of screening programs; educational forums; public service announcements on television and radio; dissemination of prevention tip sheets and workbooks; ""one-stop-shopping"" centers for meals, health screening, and social support; technical assistance to public agencies and private organizations serving older persons; and neighborhood watch programs. Experience has been gained in using these and other community-appropriate intervention strategies to increase positive health outcomes for a growing segment of American society.     Exercise and Functional Dependence.  As an increasing number of persons survive well into their 70s and 80s, greater societal, public health, and clinical attention is being focused on the prevalence and etiology of functional dependence and associated deterioration in quality of life so that interventions can be developed to reverse or prevent this dependence (Boult, Kane, Louis, Boult, & McCaffrey, 1994; Kaplan, 1992; Kiel et al., 1989; Mor et al., 1989; Rowe & Kahn, 1987). Most of the research in this area has been conducted among urban elderly, largely because urban residents are more accessible to researchers. The studies do not distinguish between urban and rural elderly or different population groups.     In addition to demographic factors (age, gender, race, income, and education) and behaviors (smoking and excessive alcohol consumption), factors frequently identified as independent predictors of functional decline include arthritis (Guralnik & Kaplan, 1989; Mor et al., 1989); lack of regular exercise (Kiel et al., 1989; Mor et al., 1989; Wagner, LaCroix, Buchner, & Larson, 1992); falls within the past year, particularly injurious falls (Dunn, Rudberg, Furner, & Cassell, 1992; Kiel, O'Sullivan, Teno, & Mor, 1991; Mor et al., 1989); and obesity (Kiel et al., 1989). In a cognitively intact population, inactivity and other high-risk behaviors are amenable to prevention efforts.     Recent epidemiological research continues to confirm the benefit of physical activity for positive health outcomes in later life (Wagner et al., 1992). Older persons who engage in leisure-time physical activity have reduced risks of morbidity and mortality as well as improved functioning (Wagner et al., 1992). Moreover, changes in physical activity levels over time are associated with changes in health status even for persons 75 and older, supporting the value of exercise-based interventions (Kaplan, 1992).     Sustained, regular physical exercise has been hypothesized to improve health and well-being through mechanisms such as improved self-efficacy, expanded social networks, attention effects, and direct physiological responses. Sorock et al. (1988) found in one investigation that walking more than 1 mile at least 3 times per week was protective against suffering a fall injury even after controlling for important health-related confounders.     Until recently, however, prevention-oriented exercise interventions were not conducted in older populations, which are assumed to be uninterested in or unable to adopt new lifestyles (Gatz, Popkin, Pino, & VandenBos, 1985). These myths are now being challenged by recent studies showing that older persons can be successfully recruited and retained in community-based exercise programs (Stevens, Hornbrook, Wingfield, Hollis, & Greenlick, 1991).     A growing body of scientific evidence also indicates the feasibility of obtaining high levels of physical activity adherence among older persons (Blumenthal et al., 1989; Emery, Hauck, & Blumenthal, 1992) and of methods for achieving adequate long-term adherence (Dishman, 1988; Sallis & Hovell, 1990). Studies of physical activity in middle-aged and older-aged adults show that adherence rates of 70 percent or higher are feasible in group- or class-based programs (Wood et al., 1983, 1988) and in properly supervised home-based programs (King & Fredericksen, 1984; King, Haskell, Taylor, Kraemer, & DeBusk, 1991; King, Taylor, Haskell, & DeBusk, 1988; King, Young, Oka, & Haskell, 1992) using appropriate techniques such as regular telephone and mail contact supplemented with periodic face-to-face encounters.     These studies underscore the utility of a regularly delivered package of behavioral strategies for enhancing long-term adherence to exercise regimens among older adults. The strategies include behavioral contracts, ongoing monitoring, regular feedback, engaging of a person's support networks, and consistent staff support. Such efforts and strategies are natural components of a comprehensive community-based health promotion program targeted to elderly persons.     Smoking Cessation.  Smoking continues to be a major health risk for most populations, including lower income and older persons. Nearly 15 percent of males and 12 percent of females age 65 and older smoked cigarettes in 1990 (National Center for Health Statistics, 1992). Although this reflects a significant drop in smoking by elderly males, from about 29 percent in 1965, older women still smoke at higher rates than their 10 percent rate in 1965. These numbers do not reflect total lifetime exposure to cigarette smoke. Currently, nearly 30 percent of males age 45 to 64 years smoke (National Center for Health Statistics, 1992).     Smoking compounds other health risks among the elderly as well. Among Americans aged 65 to 74, 70 percent have hypertension, 34 percent have borderline high serum cholesterol, and 33 percent are overweight (National Center for Health Statistics, 1992). The six leading causes of death in the United States in 1989 were, in order: heart disease, malignant neoplasms, cerebrovascular diseases, accidents and adverse effects, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and pneumonia and influenza (National Center for Health Statistics, 1992). All of these diseases and injuries have some link to smoking.     Through research, increasingly sophisticated intervention techniques have been developed to promote smoking cessation, including intensive group behavioral programs, nicotine replacement therapy, brief cognitive interventions, public media campaigns, workplace smoking cessation policies, and restrictions on smoking in public facilities. Further, health care professionals can have a powerful impact on patients' smoking behaviors (Hollis et al., 1994; Hollis, Lichtenstein, Mount, Vogt, & Stevens, 1991; Hollis, Lichtenstein, Vogt, Stevens, & Biglan, 1993). These techniques and opportunities can be combined to effect positive change in smoking habits among elderly persons.     Research shows that intensive group-intervention efforts, coupled with medical and nursing support, can be highly effective in reducing high-risk behaviors, such as smoking, among persons amenable to change (Hollis et al., 1991, 1993, 1994). Low-intensity, brief, personalized interventions for smoking cessation, although not nearly as effective as group approaches, can also be highly cost effective (Hornbrook et al., 1995). Interventions that combine physician advice with nurse counseling in primary care settings, if widely disseminated, appear to offer substantial promise for reducing national prevalence rates for smoking, including prevalence rates among elderly persons.     Disease Prevention and Screening.  Adherence to physician recommendations and use of available preventive measures are two factors that positively influence health status and yet are often overlooked by elderly persons. The reasons for elderly persons' poor adherence to and underutilization of preventive measures are not documented, and techniques to improve adherence and utilization have not been rigorously tested.     Hypothesized reasons relate, for example, to the lack of transportation, poor health, reduced cognitive function, lack of education about efficacy of prevention, and financial barriers to access (low income and lack of Medicare coverage of preventive services). Older populations, for example, often demonstrate poor adherence to immunizations recommended by their physicians and health plans, even when insurance covers these services (Mullooly et al., 1994). For individuals without health insurance coverage for vaccinations, the cost (affordability) of this important prevention measure may be a barrier to its use.     However, even among persons with coverage (e.g., individuals subscribing to health maintenance organizations offering these services), adherence in terms of the recommendations of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force is low (Mullooly et al., 1993; U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, 1989). Techniques to influence elderly persons' approach to immunizations (e.g., ignorance of, resistance to, lack of belief in efficacy of) have not been thoroughly tested, although research has shown that influenza immunizations can be a cost-saving measure for community-based health care systems (Mullooly et al., 1994).     Underutilization is demonstrated by elderly persons' use of mammography. This procedure has been shown to be an effective, including cost-effective, screening service for elderly women (Shapiro, Venet, Strax, & Venet, 1988; Tab r, Faberberg, Day, & Holmberg, 1987) and, as a result, is now covered by Medicare. However, removal of financial barriers to this service has not produced desired screening levels among older women (Zapka, Stoddard, Costanza, & Greene, 1989). Other factors that may be involved have not been delineated.     Breast cancer rates continue to be highest among unscreened women of all ages, indicating that high priority should be placed on the screening of populations that lack access to screening services, particularly low-income, nonwhite, elderly women living alone (Sobel et al., 1989). That is, the risk factors for underservice in urban areas correlate strongly with underuse of cancer screening services.     Tertiary Prevention    Supportive and restorative services for older adults have been offered as part of comprehensive integrated health care programs or as separate and distinct intervention activities. Most commonly, these services (such as home health, case management, homemaker services, personal care, companion services, adult day care, transportation, home and centralized meal programs, and respite for caregivers) have been viewed as lower-cost alternatives to expensive hospital and nursing home stays.     Comprehensive, Integrated Strategies.  Over the past two decades, several comprehensive strategies of supportive and restorative services for older adults have been implemented and evaluated in projects funded under Medicare and Medicaid waivers and by private foundations. Many of these strategies have been implemented in urban settings and have targeted specific aspects of community-based care, most commonly, accessibility, appropriateness, and adequacy of services. There has been limited examination of differences in implementation and outcomes of these comprehensive strategies between urban and rural settings and limited attention given to the acceptability of comprehensive community services to urban elderly.     Community care demonstrations funded through Medicare and Medicaid waivers in the 1970s and 1980s offered case management and an expanded package of community services to reduce nursing home placement of community dwelling older adults (Kemper, 1988; Weissert, 1985). These demonstrations, in aggregate, showed that although caregiver satisfaction improved, the small savings gained in reduced nursing home days did not offset the increased cost of providing expanded community packages.     Analyses also indicated that, in several programs, participants were not screened adequately to identify those at highest risk of nursing home placement and, thus, the programs had expanded services to many individuals less likely to use expensive nursing home days (Kemper, 1988; Kemper, Applebaum, & Harrigan, 1987; Weissert, 1985). Programs that used specific nursing home screens as sampling criteria, such as the South Carolina Community Long-Term Care Program, were more likely to show a savings in cost (Kemper et al., 1987).     In 1985, the Social Health Maintenance Organizations (Social/HMO) demonstration, funded by the Health Care Financing Administration, was implemented to examine the impact of an integrated acute and chronic health care continuum on the quality and costs of care for Medicare beneficiaries (Greenlick, Nonnenkamp, Gruenberg, Leutz, & Lamb, 1988; Leutz, Greenlick, Ervin, Feldman, & Malone, 1991). Each of the four Social/HMO sites is located in an urban setting. In addition to traditional Medicare-covered services, the Social/HMO demonstration sites offer expanded community care and nursing home services (Leutz, Abrahams, & Capitman, 1993; Leutz, Abrahams, Greenlick, Kane, & Prottas, 1988).     As in the previously cited demonstrations, the Social/HMO demonstrations rely on case management to monitor and coordinate services for high-risk individuals and to address issues of appropriateness and adequacy of care (Abrahams, Macko, & Grais, 1992). However, the results of recent studies of decision making among case managers suggest that there may be considerable variation between case managers in decisions related to allocation of services, thus affecting older adults' access to adequate and appropriate services (Abrahams, Capitman, Leutz, & Macko, 1989). In addition, initial enrollment in the Social/HMO demonstrations was very slow, suggesting that clients had concerns relating to the acceptability and perceived affordability of the more comprehensive package of community services (Greenlick et al., 1988).     The Supportive Services Program for Older Persons, funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, more directly addressed the acceptability of a variety of community services to older adults. Eleven participating home health agencies used consumer-driven marketing research approaches to determine which community services would be acceptable and affordable for older adults and their caregivers (Hereford, 1989). The intent of this study was to build home health agencies' capacity to offer new services that would become self-supporting. Services in greatest demand by older adults and their caregivers were home maintenance, housekeeping, and yard and chore support. Case management was not in as high demand as anticipated. The results indicate a need for nontraditional community services and a willingness of older adults to pay for selected services even when their incomes are limited (Hereford, 1989).     These and other studies of comprehensive strategies for supportive and restorative community services demonstrate both a demand and unmet need for these community services. To date, federally subsidized strategies have not shown consistent quality or cost outcomes in either urban or rural settings. Most of the studies have emphasized issues and outcomes related to the potential cost savings of home-based and community care in comparison with institutional care. However, it is important to note that the interventions tested in these studies may have influenced directly and/or indirectly some or all of the components of community-based care, including the availability, accessibility, affordability, appropriateness, adequacy, and acceptability of services. The results of these studies should be examined for information about strategies that enhance or diminish the effectiveness of community-based care for older adults.     Nursing-Centered, Focused Interventions.  In contrast to comprehensive, integrated strategies of supportive and restorative services, some community programs have focused on specific needs or sets of needs of vulnerable older adults. These needs include transitional care between health care settings (Naylor, 1990), long-term monitoring of chronic illness (Lamb, 1992; Lundeen, 1993), assistance with personal care and activities of daily living (Jamieson, 1990), respite care (Jamieson, 1990), and support for caregivers (Archbold, Stewart, Greenlick, & Valanis, 1993).     An example of work currently supported by the NINR is a study to examine the effects of a short-term, standardized nursing intervention. In this study, the investigators are examining the quality of life and outcomes for postsurgery cancer patients 60 years and older and family caregivers' perceived burden.     In these strategies of care, nurses increasingly play pivotal roles as administrators, decision makers on resource use, and evaluators of the quality and cost effectiveness of care. These strategies typically also are based on comprehensive community assessments and active consumer participation (Jamieson, 1990; Lundeen, 1993).     Riesch (1992a) identifies three categories of nursing-centered models: (1) community health or outreach models, which may include hospital and university-affiliated clinics (Culbert-Hinthorn, Fiscella, & Shortridge, 1985; Lundeen, 1993), parish nurse programs (McDermott & Burke, 1993), or block nursing programs (Jamieson, Campbell, & Clarke, 1989); (2) wellness and health promotion models; and (3) independent practice models. Each of these nursing models contains numerous examples of supportive and restorative programs for elderly persons. Most have been implemented in urban settings.     Research examining these models is extremely limited. As noted by Riesch (1992a, p. 22):     We know the clients and patients are satisfied with the care. We know how many and [what] types of persons avail themselves of the services. However, we know very little about the scientific adequacy of practice in these centers, the cost of care, and the outcomes.     Available studies provide helpful information about the use and acceptability of services in nurse-centered community strategies. However, there is little information on: (1) the nonmedical factors that place elders at risk of departing from the community, (2) predictors of the type and amount of supportive and restorative services needed by frail urban elderly and their caregivers, or even (3) descriptors of skilled community nursing care (Lang, Kraegel, Rantz, & Krejci, 1990; Lundeen, 1993). Little is known about how nurse-centered community strategies influence access, adequacy, or appropriateness of services for older adults in urban areas.     Urban Workers    Workplaces can be viewed as communities of workers having a variety of health care needs. Occupational health services have been developed in response to these needs, meeting the demand for health promotion, disease and injury prevention, as well as case management to minimize the effects of disease and disability associated with occupational health problems. As the American workplace changes, so will these services.     Comprehensive, community-based approaches are as valid for workers as for other communities. Faced with a myriad of different and changing job hazards, workers can benefit greatly from integrated primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention services. In addition, the workplace offers an important arena for health promotion activities directed at modifying behaviors or risk factors associated with diseases and conditions common among the U.S. population and for addressing the health care needs of vulnerable and otherwise underserved populations.     Defining the Population.  Today's occupational health care is frequently characterized as uncoordinated, fragmented, and inadequate to meet the health needs of employees. The workplace has recently been described as ""America's forgotten environment"" (Department of Occupational Safety and Health, AFL-CIO, 1993). Workplace injuries, illnesses, and fatalities impose tremendous costs on workers, employers, and society.     Employers are placing greater concern on the health needs of elderly persons, ethnic minorities, women, adolescents, and the physically challenged. Ethnic minorities, particularly African Americans, Asians, and Latinos, will influence the composition of the workforce in coming decades. Between 1980 and 1987, the number of African Americans in the U.S. workforce increased by 13 percent and the number of Latinos by 34 percent, soaring above the 7 percent increase for whites (Aguirre-Molina & Molina, 1990). Substantial increases in the number of Asian Americans in the U.S. workforce also are projected. Johnson and Packer (1987) note, ""Only 15 percent of the new entrants to the labor force over the next 13 years will be native white males, compared to 47 percent entrants in that category today.""     These changes will influence the types of health services needed and the types of worksites in which they will be offered. For example, given current patterns, ethnic minorities are more likely to be employed in semiskilled or nonprofessional occupations, will more often hold jobs that do not offer access to health care programs, and will have larger families with a high rate of households headed by single females (Aguirre-Molina & Molina, 1990). Physically challenged workers also will require a different array and form of health services.     Health Status.  Changes in the workplace have increased the need for occupational health and safety services. Premature death, diseases, injuries, and other unhealthful conditions resulting from occupational exposures pose important national health problems (U.S. Public Health Service, 1990). During 1987, permanent impairments on the job increased from 60,000 to 70,000, and totally disabling injuries numbered 1.8 million (U.S. Public Health Service, 1990).     Nearly 10,000 workers are killed on the job each year by traumatic injuries, and almost two-thirds of these (6,900) are workers in urban settings such as construction, manufacturing, transportation, public utilities, service industries, and government (National Safety Council, 1992, p. 38). Six million individuals are injured, and more than 300,000 are made ill each year by workplace hazards (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1992). As many as 100,000 workers die each year from the long-term effects of occupational diseases (Department of Occupational Safety and Health, AFL-CIO, 1993).     As noted by Peck, Goldbeck, and Myers (1987), (a) new technologies, including computers, robotics, lasers, etc., that have the potential to displace workers can pose new health threats in the workplace, including stress from forced unemploy- ment or the fear of unemployment, which can be linked to health problems; (b) hazardous substances have potential for negative effects on both workers and communities; (c) certain types of worksettings (e.g., hospitals, construction sites) are more hazardous than others; (d) growth in small businesses and service industries has increased the number of employees without health benefits; (e) violence has increased in the workplace; and (f) worker demographics are changing, with more minorities, women, adolescents, and elderly in the workforce. Among low-income individuals working, for example, in construction and service jobs, injuries and illness may be associated with, or aggravated by, low literacy and/or poor English-communication skills.     Use of Health Care Services.  Corporations have limited control over the quality and increasing costs of health care. Yet they pay for this care for 150 million Americans; in 1990, companies spent more than $3,000 per employee for health care benefits (Health Insurance Association of America, 1990). Corporations will have increasing difficulty absorbing annual increases in health care costs of 20 to 30 percent, an amount representing more than one-half of American companies' pre-tax profits (Herzlinger & Schwartz, 1985).     The current debate over different strategies for health care reform leaves the future scope of occupational health services unclear. Some believe there will be an expansion of better coordinated primary health care services provided at or near worksites (Bryant, 1991; Burgel, 1992); others believe the future lies in health promotion services and reduced primary care services at worksites (Scofield, 1990). In the 1960s and 1970s, interest in occupational safety and health focused on work-related injury and illness and employers' responsibility for identifying and controlling workplace hazards. In contrast, the 1980s were characterized by a focus on work-related health problems for which primary responsibility was placed on individual workers with emphasis on behavioral change and self-management techniques. These two approaches coexist in most workplaces today independent of each other, resulting in a piecemeal, uncoordinated approach to managing workplace health issues (DeJoy & Southern, 1993).     Community-Based Strategies.  The literature indicates that the companies providing most of the health services at worksites have 50 or more employees and that the larger the company, the greater amount of services offered (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1993). To control direct and indirect health care costs, larger companies are providing onsite primary care for employees and their dependents. The workplace not only offers convenience and accessibility for primary health care delivery, but also provides an opportunity for monitoring outcomes of care (Burgel, 1992). Within these settings, occupational health nurses provide a wide array of comprehensive health and safety services for workers and their families (American Association of Occupational Health Nurses, 1993).     Current Worksite Strategies    In a study to document the current complex role of occupational health nurses, Lusk, Disch, and Barkauskas (1988) surveyed 173 Fortune 500 companies and found that most of them employed nurses 90 percent employed registered nurses, 61 percent employed safety engineers, 61 percent employed physicians, and 45 percent employed industrial hygienists. The survey described the four most common occupational health nursing activities as (1) supervising the provision of nursing care for job-related emergency and minor illness episodes (90 percent of companies); (2) counseling employees regarding health risks (88 percent); (3) providing case management for employees with workers' compensation claims (67 percent); and (4) performing periodic health assessments (63 percent).     In this same study, Lusk and colleagues assessed employers' desires regarding future roles of occupational health nurses. Employers' expectations placed greater emphasis on analysis of trends in health promotion and risk education, development of special health programs to meet the needs of corporations, and analysis of health and cost outcomes.     In a recent statement, the American Association of Occupational Health Nurses (1993) emphasizes that the primary focus of an occupational health nurse is on preventing illnesses and injuries. Worksite nurses are responsible for delivering primary care, ensuring compliance with health and safety regulations, assessing worksite hazards, developing surveillance programs, conducting health promotion and injury prevention programs, and managing workers' compensation claims.     These worksite-based services have been categorized in the literature as primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention activities (Burgel, 1992; Dalton & Harris, 1991; DeJoy & Southern, 1993; Hoffman, 1993). Using the same definitions for primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention adopted earlier in this report, Hoffman (1993) describes as follows the types of interventions conducted in the workplace.     Primary prevention interventions include worksite analysis to address potentially hazardous work conditions; health promotion and disease prevention and health education to reduce risk factors; assurance of compliance with local, state, and Federal health and safety regulations, including mandatory Occupational and Safety Health Administration (OSHA) programs for monitoring worksites and providing surveillance; and preplacement evaluations (job matching) designed to place workers in jobs based on physical capabilities.     Secondary prevention interventions include health surveillance or screening programs to identify real and potential health problems; direct care services or assessment, minor treatment, referral, and coordination of services to injured or ill employees (employer maintains control of care for work-related injuries or illnesses); and employee assistance programs such as crisis-oriented counseling to respond to changes in work performance or for conflict and stress management.     Tertiary prevention interventions include case management, early intervention, rehabilitation, facilitating return to work, and monitoring of quality and cost of care by the right provider in the right setting. The American Disabilities Act requires reasonable accommodations by the employer so that an otherwise qualified employee can perform the job.     Outcomes.  Efforts have been made to determine health and cost outcomes of occupational health care services. In the area of primary prevention, considerable evidence demonstrates that worksite health promotion programs yield positive changes in employee behavior and health status (Katz & Showstack, 1990). Improved health status is specifically cited in relation to hypertension control, cholesterol reduction, smoking cessation, and increased physical fitness (Fielding, 1984).     A recent comprehensive review assessing the impact of worksite health promotion programs concluded that such programs can reduce annual health care costs per employee by as much as $865 (Opatz, Chenoweth, & Kaman, 1990). It is therefore not surprising that 81 percent of private worksites with 50 or more employees now offer some form of health promotion. Nor is it surprising that self-insured worksites are more likely to offer onsite wellness programs than are worksites insured through an insurance company (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1993).     Other attempts have been made to determine the costs and cost effectiveness of worksite health promotion programs. However, in examining 289 articles addressing the economic implications of worksite health promotion programs, Warner, Wickizer, Wolfe, Schildroth, and Samuelson (1988) concluded that (a) much of the literature published through early 1986 provided only anecdotal evidence and (b) the results frequently are suspect due to flawed assumptions and methodology.     In another study of worksite health promotion programs, researchers found that white employees were 2.47 times more likely to participate in a program than nonwhites (Strange et al., 1991). One of the few minority studies available suggests that one factor contributing to the seemingly low participation of African Americans and Latinos in worksite health promotion programs is the absence of cultural relevance due to the monocultural approaches in many of the current programs (Aguirre-Molina & Molina, 1990).     In the area of secondary prevention, Conway, Simmons, and Terry (1993) established, through a nationwide survey of occupational health medical surveillance programs, that the likelihood of an industry's having a medical surveillance program increased directly with the size of the company (i.e., the larger the company, the more likely they were to have a surveillance program). The most common component of the medical surveillance programs was a general physical examination before employment and periodic surveillance of employees with existing conditions. Nevertheless, most of the firms surveyed had no systematic methods or procedures for assessing the costs or effectiveness of their medical surveillance programs.     Another widespread secondary prevention activity is employee assistance programs. The goal of these programs is to provide short-term counseling services to employees who encounter personal problems that might affect their work performance. In a national survey conducted in 1992, nearly all worksites had a formal policy concerning the use of alcohol and other drugs. Forty percent of the worksites surveyed offered an employee assistance program, either directly or indirectly through an outside contractor. One-fourth (26 percent) of the worksites had an employee drug testing program for all their employees, and 14 percent had one for some of their employees (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1993).     In the area of tertiary prevention, several studies document that an integrated approach to disability prevention, including accident prevention, case management, and return-to-work policies, is most effective in reducing medical claims and wage-loss claims for work-related illnesses and injuries (Dalton & Harris, 1991; DeJoy & Southern, 1993; Scofield & Martin, 1990).     Most of the research on primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention in the workplace is descriptive and focuses on individual programs rather than integrative or comprehensive approaches linking primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention services. A few examples of systems having demonstrated linkages across the care continuum have been documented (Dalton & Harris, 1991; Scofield & Martin, 1990). In most instances, however, health service programs are fragmented and uncoordinated organizationally, with responsibilities distributed among a company's health service and human resources and safety and hygiene units.     Given these fragmented individual programs, measuring long-term health care and cost outcomes is difficult if not impossible. Some authors (e.g., Katz & Showstack, 1990) suggest, however, that comprehensive, broad-based program efforts are more likely to be effective in reducing health care costs than single-issue programs in occupational health services.     Strategies for the Future    Significant changes are occurring in the American workforce. The principal shift is away from a manufacturing-based economy to an economy based on the provision of services. Hazards to exposures in heavy industry, such as those faced by coal workers, may be less important in the future, while hazards associated with office work, such as exposure to video display terminals, or with new synthetic materials and solvents, such as those used in the electronics industry, may become more important.     In urban areas, the increase in service jobs which often involve more part time and shift work conducted indoors present specific environmental problems, including indoor air pollution, inadequately designed workspaces, and high levels of stress. Specific service jobs which are often filled by ethnic minorities, women, adolescents, elders, and low-income individuals present additional hazards, including violence in the workplace. Some of the hazards associated with service jobs have been documented, but few specific data are available.     For example, homicide, often occurring among service workers, is the leading cause of occupational death from injury for women and the third leading cause of occupational death among all workers (American Association of Occupational Health Nurses, 1993). Other hazards associated with service jobs include back injuries and exposure to infectious diseases, bloodborne pathogens (e.g., HIV, hepatitis B and C), and needle sticks.     Most recent empirical work on occupational health care services focuses, first, on health promotion or disease and injury prevention activities; second, on health surveillance and direct care services; and, third, on case management and monitoring of work-related disability effects. An untested but promising approach is suggested by Burgel (1992) who proposes use of nurse-managed primary health care delivery models at or near worksites. She proposes five models to meet the needs of small and large employers in geographically dispersed communities:     Model #1, with a single nurse onsite, may be the best choice for employers with limited resources, a small workforce, or few workplace hazards. The nurse acts as the inhouse expert on health-related issues and develops a network of quality, community-based referrals for services not provided inhouse.     Model #2, a multiple-nurse unit onsite, is ideal for employers with a medium-to-large workforce. Essential services are offered onsite in a nurse-managed care center. The focus is on primary care as well as work-related illnesses and injuries.     Model #3, the consortium, enables groups of employers with a small number of workers to provide services in a centralized, nurse-managed, free-standing clinic. Essential services are provided onsite with expanded hours of service, and a local hospital provides services during off hours through a preferred provider arrangement.     Model #4, with onsite services (as in model #2) accommodates a large workforce and provides services to neighboring small businesses through contractual arrangement.     Model #5 offers the services of an occupational health nurse, acting as consultant, to small businesses in geographically scattered locations. This nurse consultant is onsite at each location periodically, providing some direct services and coordinating other services through a local hospital and nearby specialty providers.     Each model incorporates five criteria essential for providing quality in a cost-conscious environment: (1) quality-provider availability; (2) consumer involvement, with emphasis on prevention and prudent purchase of health care services; (3) use of practice guidelines to assure quality of care; (4) accountability assumed by the providers for the quality of care and costs; and (5) use of a case management system. The development of nurse-managed primary health care delivery strategies at or near the worksite is critical to meeting the health care needs of today's urban worker. These strategies could deliver accessible, quality care to employees and their dependents at a reasonable cost.     Research Needs and Opportunities     The agenda for nursing research on community-based health care strategies for urban populations must focus on developing, demonstrating, and assessing innovative nursing-based approaches to preventing disease and functional impairment and to delivering care to multirisk, vulnerable underserved populations. Community-based health care strategies in which nurses and nurse researchers play a leadership role hold promise for reorienting the health care system's traditional focus on acute and curative care to emphasis on the promotion of health and primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention of disease.     Presented below are research needs and opportunities for research on community-based interventions addressing the health care needs of all urban underserved populations. These populations include low-income individuals and families, ethnic and racial minorities, urban elderly, and urban workers.     Five general areas of research needs and opportunities are described: descriptive data collection; prevention activities; factors affecting care; comprehensive community-based strategies; and assessing effectiveness. Nurse researchers have an opportunity to play a leadership role in each area, working in tandem with other health care professionals in designing, implementing, and assessing community-based strategies for vulnerable and underserved urban populations.     Descriptive Data Collection    Defining Populations.  A critical issue in defining populations is the ability to identify all members of a defined group, including timely identification of changes in the membership of this group (e.g., births, death, adoptions, marriages, divorces, emigration, immigration, health insurance). Related to this is the need to identify characteristics of individuals in sufficient detail and specificity for determining disease risk, appropriate health care interventions, and care outcomes.     Representative sample surveys are conducted regularly by the Federal and state governments. However, the design and implementation of these surveys do not always enable researchers to identify basic health status information by appropriate ethnic, age, and other characteristics that can be important identifiers of potential risk.     Similarly, individual researchers may fail to use up-to-date, culturally sensitive categories in gathering information about these basic identifying characteristics. To make progress in understanding the relative contribution of individual and community or contextual factors to the success of various interventions in urban settings, basic descriptive data are needed on the identifying characteristics of individuals.     Determining Health Status.  The health status, problems, and needs of many urban underserved populations have not been clearly delineated. Descriptive data are needed for many populations before appropriate and effective health care inter- ventions can be designed. Related to this is the need to identify known and potential risk factors for poor health and dysfunction in specific populations, including disease-specific markers of illness severity and progression. These data should reflect the complexity and diversity of urban living for low-income individuals and families, ethnic and racial minorities, elderly persons, and workers. Information also is needed on the outcomes of illnesses and their treatment in order to assess the effectiveness of care.     In order to conduct appropriate and effective community-based strategies, the knowable risk profile of all members of a target population should be available on a timely basis to the primary health care team charged with designing, conducting, and assessing a primary, secondary, and/or tertiary prevention program for this population.     Refining Measurement Tools.  New measures of ethnic identity, socioeconomic status, and assimilation have been developed but need to be more widely and consistently applied in describing urban populations. In particular, measures of ethnic identity are available which allow researchers to discriminate individuals who identify with more than one group and/or are members of an ethnic subgroup not differentiated separately from a larger category. New measures of socioeconomic status incorporate the realization that, in some racial and ethnic groups, income may not be as important a determinant of status as other variables.     Prevention Activities    Primary Prevention.  Nurse researchers can play an especially important role in primary prevention in urban settings by fostering, guiding, and assessing health education efforts to reduce risk factors associated with disability and death (e.g., violence and substance abuse), health promotion activities (e.g., related to exercise and nutrition), and disease prevention (e.g., immunizations). In these efforts, they can participate in expanding existing programs or developing new intervention programs aimed at modifying health-compromising behaviors of urban underserved populations, including urban racial and ethnic groups and populations in relapse (e.g., drug abusers, smokers), as well as low-income women and children, elderly persons, and workers.     Cost-effective interventions are especially needed to modify lifelong habits undermining health, such as inactivity, alcohol abuse, physical and psychological abuse, and poor diet. Nurse researchers, in coordination with other health care professionals, can develop comprehensive counseling and education programs to inform clients about long-term health risks. While the medical care system has focused on treatment of advanced, complex disease processes facilitated by a payment system biased toward diagnosed conditions low priority has been placed on disease prevention and health promotion efforts. Nurse researchers can promote attention to these efforts long emphasized by the nursing profession.     Secondary Prevention.  Another promising area of research in urban settings is community-based strategies focused on secondary prevention (early detection of disease and intervention before symptoms appear). Existing programs need to be assessed in terms of their impact, efficacy, and cost effectiveness, and new programs need to be designed and tested. In particular, nurse researchers can bring their unique perspective to the design and evaluation of health surveillance and screening programs targeted to ethnic and racial minorities, low-income women and children, urban elderly, and urban workers.     Tertiary Prevention.  Community-based tertiary prevention strategies for urban populations have received little focus in comparison with primary or secondary prevention. Yet, the need for these strategies, particularly among elderly populations and disabled workers, suggests many opportunities for nursing research.     With the aim of minimizing the effects of disease or disability and reducing complications or premature deterioration, nurse researchers should seek active roles in designing comprehensive, community-based programs of transition care management, rehabilitation, and care management across the full range of health services. The needs, and the resources available for meeting these needs, will vary across settings and populations. Research is particularly needed to define and test nurse-managed, coordinated strategies for different underserved urban populations.     Factors Affecting Care    The emphasis in clinical services and research supporting these services has been on actual services delivered and/or the quality of services received. In developing and testing new community-based strategies, attention needs to be given to key factors affecting the care provided and received.     Availability/Accessibility/Affordability.  Three critical factors in the demand for and use of prevention services by urban underserved populations are the availability, accessibility, and costs of these services. Additional research is needed to clarify the dimensions of these factors for vulnerable urban populations, especially racial and ethnic minorities, low-income women and children, and urban elderly. Insurance coverage and awareness of available services are two dimensions noted thus far. New interventions should incorporate the knowledge gained from this research.     Appropriateness/Adequacy/Acceptability.  Use of health care services is also a reflection of whether the services offered are appropriate, adequate, and acceptable to the population(s) for which they are designed. The dimensions of these factors have not been explored sufficiently in specific urban underserved populations. Given nurses' access to these populations through school- and community-based clinics, nurse researchers have an opportunity to shed light on these particular dimensions and to involve community members in their explanation. Two related issues are contextual effects and cultural factors, noted below.     Contextual Effects.  Most interventions in urban settings have been developed to meet unmet needs under specific local conditions with specific vulnerable populations. As these interventions are studied more intensively and/or in different populations, measuring and analyzing relevant contextual effects will be important. The effects of family structure and function, community environment, and available resources are particularly important in both designing and assessing the effectiveness of community-based strategies.     Cultural Factors.  Language barriers, culture-specific beliefs and health practices, the cultural knowledge of professional and lay care providers, and other cultural aspects of community organization reflect the broad diversity of urban environments and influence the assumptions and actions that affect individuals' health status directly or indirectly. Cultural factors have been included in the design and/or analysis of numerous individual studies of urban populations, particularly innovative interventions tested within the U.S. health care system.     The challenge in expanding research on community-based nursing strategies is to identify and measure cultural factors at all research stages from assessing community needs to planning and designing an intervention, implementing the inter- vention, analyzing and interpreting data, and determining outcomes. Culture is far more than language, and the complexity of understanding culture's contribution to effective care is demonstrated by studies that show that data provided by respondents may differ based on the language of the interview and the cultural similarities of the interviewer and respondent.     Research is particularly needed on the factors involved in fostering and maintaining a community's ""ownership"" of the health care services offered. Identifying needs and services for particular populations is no longer sufficient, given the new paradigm of health care adopted by this panel. Increased research to understand communities' endorsement and participation in health-promoting interventions is now required.     Comprehensive Community-Based Strategies    Community-based studies are needed to further describe the health status, health behavior, and barriers to health care among vulnerable and underserved urban populations; to establish culturally specific health promotion, disease prevention, and treatment strategies in community settings; and to demonstrate new ways of recruiting and sustaining the involvement of underserved populations in community-based health promotion activities. Such studies will also be useful in identifying criteria for selecting organizations with which nurse researchers can collaborate on prevention activities.     Defining a Community.  As suggested in this chapter, an urban underserved community may consist of a particular ethnic or racial population or subgroup, a group or subset of low-income women and/or children, urban elderly residing in a given area or participating in a senior-citizen center or day-care facility, or workers in a company or at a worksite. The variables defining a community need to be explored and the findings applied in the design and evaluation of community-based strategies. As noted previously, for example, the target community for strategies for low-income children in some population groups may extend beyond the children's immediate family to include extended families or nonfamily members.     Involving the Community.  Special efforts are needed to uncover innovative ways to encourage community members' involvement and participation in assessing the health care needs of their community and in designing programs to address these needs. For urban settings, these efforts must necessarily take into account socioeconomic, cultural, and related contextual factors influencing members' involvement and participation. The extent to which this involvement actually occurs also needs to be evaluated.     Integrating Services.  Comprehensive community-based strategies offer potential for integrating primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention services and providing a continuum of care for urban underserved populations. This integration of services across a spectrum of care promises great benefit in improving the health awareness and health status of these populations. Strategies could include public-private partnerships among managed care organizations, state and local health departments, and public and private health programs focused on disease prevention, health promotion, and management of chronic illness. In constructing these strategies for urban populations, special attention must be given to the multiple health risks, including environmental risks, faced by urban underserved populations; the mix of behavioral and biological factors contributing to these health risks; and the need for an interdisciplinary approach incorporating the experience, skills, and techniques of all the health care professionals involved.     Assessing Effectiveness    Community-based systems bring health care out of the hospitals into the communities served by these hospitals. A variety of approaches are used in urban settings, including community health centers, nurse-managed clinics, home visitation, and educational and other outreach programs. The benefits to individual users suggest promising results (McElmurry et al., 1991; Olds, Henderson, Tatelbaum, & Chamberlin, 1988).     Equally important are the benefits to professional health care providers who can engage the participants in community-based programs as research partners for identifying the health care problems, and possible solutions to these problems, for urban underserved populations. In addition, the ensuing dialogue between urban communities and health care providers has been credited with fostering a sense of community empowerment (e.g., through collective decision making) that can be focused on numerous problems other than simply health care (McElmurry et al., 1990, 1991).     Reports highlighting the impact of community-based health care strategies demonstrate the benefit of working within community-based settings and within settings that play a strong role in the life of a community. However, health disparities and barriers to accessing health care continue to persist even for populations (e.g., African Americans) whose health status and health dilemmas have been well described and for which successful strategies of care have been documented (Brooks et al., 1991).     Few researchers have attempted to describe the characteristics of community-based health care settings deemed to be essential to developing successful community-based health care strategies (Hatch et al., 1993; Michielutte & Beal, 1990). Identification of these critical indicators, however, is important for the populations in need and for professionals attempting to identify and select organizations or settings for collaboration in delivering community-based health promotion, disease prevention, and treatment services.     In addition, few reports compare the impact of community-based health care strategies across various points of access, and few studies compare the effectiveness and efficiency of specific community-based strategies targeted to different popu- lations (Lewin-Epstein, 1991; McBride, 1993; Sullivan, 1992). Similarly, the degree to which community-based strategies help reduce society's health care burden and improve the health of different populations has not been determined.     Research is particularly needed to establish the impact, efficacy, and cost effectiveness of culturally specific health promotion, disease prevention, and treatment strategies in community settings. Systematic comparative studies are needed to assess existing community-based strategies, including both focused and comprehensive interventions, to define the characteristics of successful interventions.     Such studies should include measurement of the influence of community involvement on changes in the health status of community members. Methods need to be developed for monitoring the actual extent to which community members are fully invested and involved in defining health needs, developing interventions, and assessing their effectiveness. All these variables and methods then need to be incorporated into the design and evaluation of new interventions.     Recommendations    Based on the foregoing assessment of the state of the science and research needs and opportunities for community-based health care strategies in urban settings, the panel offers the following recommendations for future research. The overall goal of these recommendations is to identify and test models for improving the health of target populations. The recommendations may apply to rural settings as well.     Develop and test innovative community-based strategies for health care, including public-private partnerships among managed care organizations, state and local health departments, and public and private health programs that focus on disease prevention and health promotion and management of chronic illness in vulnerable and underserved urban popula- tions.     Develop and test screening tools for identifying urban populations that are vulnerable to health problems requiring intervention and health status monitoring.     Determine the impact of various care management strategies, including managed care, on outcomes and costs for at-risk individuals, families, and defined populations across various types of urban community settings.     Develop culturally relevant measures of individual, family, and community functioning which are appropriate for community-based studies.     Develop and test culturally relevant measures of clinical and cost outcomes of community-based interventions. Examine the impact of cultural factors on use and outcomes of community-based programs.     Develop and test community-based strategies that actively seek and have consumer participation in the design, conduct, and evaluation of health services. Develop and test measures of the extent and effect of community representation on meeting the goals and objectives of community models being evaluated.     Design studies of community-based health care strategies, including managed care, that are of sufficiently large enough scale to enable analysis of the relative contribution of individual, family, and community characteristics and of intervention(s) to clinical and cost outcomes.     Describe factors associated with successful outcomes of community-based care strategies targeted to vulnerable and underserved urban populations.     Develop and test classification systems for health problems and interventions that are sensitive to cultural differences.     Develop and test strategies, such as disease registries, within communities as a basis for implementing and testing ""safety net"" programs in secondary and tertiary prevention.     Develop and test alternative primary care strategies that integrate delivery of acute, ambulatory, and long-term care for vulnerable populations such as frail elderly.     References    Abel, E., & von Unwerth, L.
