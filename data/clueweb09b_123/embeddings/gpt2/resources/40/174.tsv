These candies are distributed nationwide and internationally under the brands Kimbo, Asian Taste, Jin Jin and Shen Hsiang Jen Foods. The candies are packaged in small sealed plastic cups.         These candies contain the ingredient ""konjac"" (also known as conjac, konnyaku, yam flour, or glucomannan). The Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Food and Drug Administration consider this type of candy to pose a serious choking risk, particularly to infants, children and the elderly. Local authorities have reported six children's deaths from choking in the United States associated with this type of jelly candy. There have also been reports of deaths in other countries.    Each mini Jelly cup is about the size of a single size coffee creamer.         The Kimbo Lychee Flavor Jelly is sold in plastic bags containing about 18 cups. The Asian Taste-Konnyaku Fruit Jelly (Lychee Flavor) is sold in 1500 gram plastic jars containing about 105 cups. Jin Jin Tropical Mix Fruit is sold in 1500 gram plastic jars containing about 105 cups. Sheng Hsiang Jen Food Co Mini Fruity Gels (Peach, Lychee, and assorted flavors) are sold in plastic jars.         Walong Marketing, Inc., has requested recall through distributors and retailers to consumers. Consumers are urged to return this product to the place of purchase for a full refund. Consumers with questions may contact the company at 714-670-8899.         In August and October 2001, the FDA issued general warnings against consuming mini-cup gel candies that contain the ingredient ""konjac"". In December 2001 and January 2002 two other firms recalled gel candies. Although the agency issued an import alert to address importation of these candies in October 2001, candies imported prior to the import alert are still in the US market.         These candies are sold under various brand names, distributed by various companies. The FDA continues to investigate and follow-up this issue.

Raw milk, which            is used to produce these cheeses, gives them distinctive flavors, textures,            and cooking properties. Even though some American companies are producing            Hispanic-style cheeses from pasteurized milk (a U.S. requirement for            cheeses aged less than 60 days), these do not exhibit the full range            of properties of cheeses made from raw milk.                     Researchers at  ARS '            Eastern Regional Research Center (ERRC) in Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania, are            studying Hispanic cheeses to help producers meet the increasing demand            for them. Total Hispanic-style cheese production in the United States            jumped 52 percent from 1996 to 2001, when more than 102 million pounds            were sold, according to USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service.            In fact, it is one of the fastest growing U.S. food markets, outpacing            the growth of the cheddar and mozzarella markets.            It's Flavor, Not Fire                     Hispanic-style cheese does not mean hot-and-spicy cheese; other ingredients            make Hispanic dishes hot. In general, the cheeses are white or off-white            and moist. They taste like fresh milk. They become soft and creamy when            heated but do not lose shape, run, or separate into greasy solids and            liquids. Most cheeses are fresh, though some are aged. Many are mild            tasting and crumbly. Others are harder and have stronger flavor.                     Chemist Diane L. Van Hekken and colleagues in ERRC's Dairy Processing            and Products Research Unit are studying selected Hispanic cheeses made            in Mexico to better understand how specific processing techniques result            in their desirable qualities. They are looking at the cheeses' chemical            and physical makeup to learn how these properties relate to flavor;            texture, such as chewiness and stringiness; and function, such as the            ability to melt or be sliced. They want to find ways to duplicate these            characteristics by following U.S. practices and standards. Then, they            hope to apply the findings to improving cheese-processing techniques            in general.                     According to Van Hekken, there is not a lot of literature available            for researchers on the characteristics of these cheese types, and so            a main objective is to compile needed references.           In Search of Authenticity                     The researchers are looking at four specific cheese types. The first,            Queso Blanco, may be the most popular cheese south of the border. It            is soft and won't melt. Panela is mild, sweet, and crumbly. Asadero            is a smooth, yellow cheese that is somewhat tangy and good for baking.            And last, Van Hekken's research team traveled to Mexico twice, where            they are working with a collaborator to examine Mennonite-style cheeses            from the state of Chihuahua. These semihard cheeses—named after            the Mennonite settlers who introduced them to the region—are similar            to Queso Quesadilla and Menonita found in the United States.                     ""All these cheeses have been developed for specific purposes,""            Van Hekken explains. ""People can't cook a Mexican-style dish, for            example, with American-style cheese and expect it to taste authentic.            Restaurants that want their dishes to be traditional know this, and            they search for the right cheeses.""                     A sensory evaluation board (taste panel) at ERRC has been working since            May 2001 to define the flavor profiles of both raw and pasteurized cheeses.            MaryAnne Drake, a professor with North Carolina University's Department            of Food Science, helped initiate training for panelists to become human            instruments and to use a common terminology in describing what they            taste.                      The researchers also hope to improve the shelf life of Hispanic-style            cheeses, which will expand their marketability here and in foreign markets            and ensure high food-safety standards.—By  Jim            Core,  Agricultural Research Service Information Staff.

Bulk American cheese is American cheese which is packaged in bulk form. No single piece of cheese, whatever its shape, shall weigh less than 100 pounds.  58.2456 American cheese. American cheese includes the following varieties of cheese: (a) Cheddar cheese and cheddar cheese for manufacturing shall conform to the provisions of 21 CFR 133.113 and 133.114, respectively, ""Cheeses and Related Cheese Products,"" as issued by the Food and Drug Administration. (b) Washed curd cheese (soaked curd cheese) and washed curd cheese for manufacturing shall conform to the provisions of 21 CFR 133.136 and 133.137, respectively, ""Cheeses and Related Cheese Products,"" as issued by the Food and Drug Administration. (c) Granular cheese (stirred curd cheese) and granular cheese for manufacturing shall conform to the provisions of 21 CFR 133.144 and 133.145, respectively, ""Cheeses and Related Cheese Products,"" as issued by the Food and Drug Administration. (d) Colby cheese and colby cheese for manufacturing shall conform to the provisions of 21 CFR 133.118 and 133.119, respectively, ""Cheeses and Related Cheese Products,"" as issued by the Food and Drug Administration.  58.2457 Packaging. (a) The primary container (liner) shall be new, in good condition, unbroken, fully protective of all surfaces of the cheese, and properly closed or sealed so as to protect the cheese from damage, contamination or excessive desiccation. If the cheese is handled and stored in only a primary container after cooling, there shall be a satisfactory system for cooling the cheese, retaining the desired shape, and providing reasonable protection of the cheese during transportation, storage, and handling.  Compliance with these standards does not excuse failure to comply with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. 1  1   (b) The secondary container, when used, shall be in good condition and shall satisfactorily protect the cheese. The secondary container shall be of such construction and be filled to a sufficient level so as not to cause handling, stacking, or storage problems. (c) If antimycotics are used, they shall be used in accordance with the provisions of Food and Drug Administration regulations (21 CFR part 133).  58.2458 Degree of curing. (a) Fresh (Current)--Cheese which is the early stages of the curing process, usually 10 to about 90 days old. (b) Cured (Aged)--Cheese which has the more fully developed flavor and body attributes which are characteristic of the curing process, generally over 90 days old. U.S. Grades  58.2459 Nomenclature of U.S. grades. The nomenclature of U.S. grades is as follows: (a) U.S. Extra Grade. (b) U.S. Standard Grade. (c) U.S. Commercial Grade.  58.2460 Basis for determination of U.S. grades. (a) The determination of U.S. grades of bulk American cheese shall be based on the rating of the following quality factors: (1) Flavor. (2) Body and Texture. (3) Finish and Appearance (as determined by examination of at least the filling end). (b) The rating of each quality factor shall be established on the basis of characteristics present in a randomly selected sample representing a vat of cheese. If the cheese in a container is derived from more than one vat, the container labeling shall so indicate by showing both vat numbers, and the grade shall be determined on the basis of the lowest grade of either vat. The cheese shall be graded no sooner than 10 days after being placed into the primary container. (c) The final U.S. grade shall be established on the basis of the lowest rating of any one of the quality factors.  2    58.2461 Specifications for U.S. grades. (a) U.S. Extra Grade.

GX253-68-7987145	"Fiscal Notes      May 2003               Texas candy makers stir up sweet treats       Texas' Sugar Rush        While U.S. sales of confectionery products indicate that America's sweet tooth is growing stronger, Texas sales of sweets have hit the highs and lows of a sugar rush.     Americans ate about 3.1 billion pounds of chocolate confectionery products and about 3.2 billion pounds of non-chocolate confectionery in 2001, says Susan Fussell of the National Confectioners Association (NCA).     ""The candy industry is doing very well,"" Fussell says. From 2000 to 2001 the candy industry grew 1.5 percent, and the chocolate industry grew 2.3 percent, she says.     Retail sales of candy and chocolate products in the U.S. rose from $23.8 billion in 2000 to $24 billion in 2001, according to the NCA Web site,  www.candyusa.org . Except for a slight downturn in 1999, sales of candy and chocolate products have risen steadily in the U.S. since 1994.     Fussell says that economic downturns do not prompt consumers to cut back on sweets.     ""Fortunately, there is candy sold at every price range, so people can modify their budgets and still buy candy,"" she says.     In Texas, however, candy sales tend to fluctuate, sometimes greatly, from year to year. According to sales tax data from the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts, Texas sales of candy and other confectionery products rose from $48.1 million in 2000 to $48.4 million in 2001, though numbers haven't returned to the state's 1998 high of $87.1 million.     The industry also has consolidated in Texas. The number of confectioners dropped from a 1993 high of 61 firms to 46 firms in 2002.     Despite these fluctuations, Texas candy makers are claiming their part of the nation's billion-dollar candy industry with several Texas confectioners poised for expansion.      Willy Wonka of the West      In March 2002, Susie Hitchcock-Hall, owner of Susie's South Forty Confections in Midland, Texas, moved her operation to a facility five times larger than its previous one.     ""I started in my kitchen in November 1991,"" Hitchcock-Hall says. ""I started with one small kettle, and needed another one in five months.""     She now has 10 full-time employees and 58 seasonal employees.     Susie's South Forty is made up of the factory, an outlet store and one retail store, and Hitchcock-Hall says she is looking for an additional retail store location. She also plans to launch a new line of white chocolate products in summer 2003.     Sweet Shop USA, established in 1972 in Fort Worth, is also set to expand. Sweet Shop USA produces handmade chocolates marketed to high-end department stores and specialty stores, says Anna Parker, with marketing and new product development.     ""If you buy the house-brand chocolates at Neiman Marcus, chances are that the Sweet Shop made those chocolates,"" Parker says.     In July 2000, Sweet Shop USA moved to a 66,000 square-foot facility after its previous facility was destroyed by a tornado. Parker says the new facility has a larger production area and can produce more than 10,000 pounds of gourmet chocolate daily, but she says the company is looking for an even larger location.     In August 2000, Sweet Shop USA acquired Price's Fine Chocolates and Annaclairs of Kansas City, Mo., and Mrs. Weinsteins's Toffee of Santa Barbara, Calif. The brands are now produced in Fort Worth.      Virtual candy store      Local candy stores are gaining new markets through online sales. For many small shops, Internet sales are replacing traditional, mail-order sales.     Lammes Candies Since 1885, based in Austin, includes the company's Web site information in its catalogues. President Pam Teich says that as more people become comfortable with online shopping, they are buying things on the Internet that they used to order through the mail.     The company has nine retail stores located in and around Austin. So far, the Lammes Candies' mail-order department makes up 10 percent of sales.     ""If you take our mail-order department as a whole, it would average in sales to one of our regular retail stores,"" Teich says.     In 2003, Sweet Shop USA began selling its chocolates online as well.     ""It seems to be doing really good,"" Parker says. ""There are more people getting on the Internet and shopping.""      Sweet indulgences      Candy consumers may be getting more health-conscious. Fussell cites recent studies promoting the health benefits of antioxidants found in chocolate and says that requests for sugar-free candies are soaring. In 2002, sales of sugar-free, non-chocolate candy, also called diet candy, were up 23 percent from 2001, she says.     Hitchcock-Hall is working on a recipe for sugar-free chocolates.     ""One in three new customers ask for sugar-free products,"" she says.     Fussell attributes the sugar-free surge to baby boomers.     ""With the soar in the population of baby boomers, there is an increased interest in what kinds of foods make up their diets, and they want to fit sweet indulgences into their lives,"" Fussell says.      Candy stop      A couple of big names in the candy industry have opened manufacturing facilities in Texas, including M&M Mars in Waco and Russell Stover in Corsicana.     Russell Stover's Corsicana plant employs at least 900 people and produces 100,000 pounds of candy daily, says Sandra Madison, the Corsicana outlet store manager.     In addition to being a manufacturing facility, the Corsicana outlet store acts as a tourist destination.     ""We get people from all over the place; some tour buses even put us on their lists,"" Madison says.     ""In the off season, we get at least 150 visitors a day. Christmas is our busiest season, and we can get up to 400 visitors a day.""      Your corner candy store      Though the candy industry seems to be dominated by large candy conglomerates such as Mars and Russell Stover, most communities have a local candy maker, Fussell says. She says many candy operations, even the larger ones, are privately held companies that have been handed down through generations.     ""Ours is a fun business to be in,"" Teich says. ""Most companies our size and smaller are family owned and operated. It's almost like an art form being passed down from generation to generation.""

The illegal product, sometimes called ""Bathtub"" cheese, poses a health threat to California consumers because unlicensed manufacturers frequently use raw, unpasteurized milk that can encourage the growth of harmful bacteria. Manufacturers also use bathtubs, home made wooden vats and rusted cheese molds, and they may store the cheese in barns or garages lacking adequate pest control and sanitation. CDFA will test samples from this latest seizure for the presence of bacteria. ""We want to warn people about the dangers of eating illegally produced soft cheese,"" said CDFA Secretary William (Bill) J. Lyons, Jr. ""By identifying illegal operations and publicizing the risks to consumers, we hope to prevent illness or even more tragic consequences."" Listeria and Salmonella are the most common bacteria found in ""Bathtub"" cheese. While the bacteria cannot be detected by sight, taste or smell, it can cause severe illness to infants, the elderly and those with impaired immune systems. The bacteria may also cause miscarriages, infections to the blood stream, diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramping. Queso Fresco is a soft white cheese that has a mild, slightly salty flavor. While licensed, safe and wholesome Queso Fresco is available from reputable firms, it is often sold by unlicensed manfacturers at swap meets, flea markets, small neighborhood markets and door-to-door. CDFA participated on a 54-member task force of investigators from federal, state and local agencies to inspect cheese for sale at multiple locations in the Eastvale-area. In California, it is a criminal offense to manufacture and sell cheese from an unlicensed facility. Each conviction carries a sentence of up to one year in jail and a maximum fine of $10,000.

GX001-67-11301158	"U. S. Department of Health and Human Services   U. S. Food and Drug Administration   Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition  May 2003      Consumer Questions and Answers About BSE     What is ""Mad Cow Disease"" (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy)?     Mad Cow Disease is the layperson's name for Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), a transmissible, slowly progressive, degenerative, fatal disease affecting the central nervous system of adult cattle. There is no evidence to date of BSE affecting U.S. cattle, despite an aggressive surveillance program under which nearly 20,000 animals were tested last year.     Does BSE affect humans?     BSE is a disease that affects cattle. However, there is a disease similar to BSE called variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), or vCJD, which is found in humans.  There have been a small number of cases of vCJD reported, primarily in the United Kingdom, occurring in people who consumed beef that may have been contaminated. (As of May 2003, there have been a total of approximately 139 cases of vCJD worldwide.)  There is strong scientific evidence (epidemiological and laboratory) that the agent that causes BSE in cattle is the agent that causes vCJD in people. The one reported case of vCJD in the United States was from a young women that contracted the disease while residing in the UK.  The symptoms appeared years later after the young woman moved to the U.S.      The disease, vCJD, which primarily affects younger persons, is very hard to diagnose until the disease has nearly run its course. In its early stages, the disease may manifest itself through neurologic symptoms, but it is not until the latter stages of the disease that brain abnormalities detectable by x-ray or MRI can be seen.    Is it possible to get vCJD from eating food purchased in the United States?     The disease, vCJD, has been associated with the consumption of foods produced from BSE infected animals. Because BSE has never been found in the U.S., it is unlikely that food purchased in the U.S., such as at a grocery store or restaurant, would be contaminated.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has restricted the importation of live ruminants, such as cows and sheep, and most food products from these animals from BSE countries since 1989, and from all European countries since 1997.  It is important for consumers to know that:        No meat products from ruminant animals from the 33 countries identified as having BSE or at risk for having BSE are allowed in the U.S. This includes meat products used in human, animal, and pet foods. Milk and milk products continue to be imported into the U.S. from these countries because milk and milk products are not believed to pose any risk for transmitting BSE to humans. Experiments have shown that milk from BSE-infected cows has not caused infections in the same species or in other test animals.      Under an Import Alert, FDA stops cosmetic and dietary supplement ingredients containing bovine materials from animals originating in the 33 countries where BSE has been found or is at risk for being found from entering the U.S.        What is being done to determine whether the newly recognized vCJD is occurring in the United States?     With heightened concern about vCJD in Europe, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have enhanced their vCJD surveillance in the U.S. To date, there has been one reported case of vCJD in the United States.  A young women contracted the disease while residing in the UK.  The symptoms appeared years later after she moved to the U.S.      What is the current risk to American consumers traveling to foreign countries of acquiring vCJD?     According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the current risk of acquiring vCJD from any specific country appears to be extremely small, but cannot be precisely determined because cattle products from one country might be distributed and consumed in others.     When and how did BSE in cattle occur?     BSE has been of great concern since 1986, when it was first reported among cattle in the United Kingdom.  At its peak, in January 1993, almost 1,000 new cases per week were identified. The outbreak in the United Kingdom may have started from the feeding of scrapie-contaminated sheep meat-and-bone meal to cattle. Scrapie is a disease of sheep that is related to BSE in cattle. There is strong evidence that the outbreak in cattle was amplified in the United Kingdom by feeding rendered bovine meat-and-bone meal to young calves.  The nature of the transmissible agent in BSE is not known. Currently, the most accepted theory is that the agent is a modified form of a normal cell surface component known as a prion protein. Why or how this substance changes to become disease-producing is still unknown. Prions are resistant to common treatments, such as heat, to reduce or eliminate its infectivity or presence.    Milk and milk products from cows are not believed to pose any risk for transmitting the BSE agent because experiments have shown that milk from BSE-infected cows has not caused BSE in cows or other test animals.     What countries have reported cases of BSE or are considered to have a substantial risk associated with BSE?     These countries are:  Albania, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia, The Netherlands, Norway, Oman, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Japan, and United Kingdom (Great Britain including Northern Ireland and the Falkland Islands).      Canada has recently been added to this list of countries from which imports are restricted.      Is BSE Affecting Cattle in the United States?     Active surveillance for BSE in the highest risk cattle in the United States has failed to identify any cases of BSE in the United States. Federal and state agencies have taken a series of actions to prevent the introduction of BSE into the US food supply.    For example, to prevent BSE from entering the United States, firm restrictions were placed on the importation of live ruminants and ruminant products including meat, meat-and-bone meal, offals, and glands from countries where BSE was known to exist.  These restrictions were later extended to include importation of ruminants and certain ruminant products not only from BSE-positive countries, but also countries thought to be at high risk for BSE, even if the disease hadn't been identified in those countries.    In addition, FDA prohibits the use of most mammalian protein in the manufacture of animal feeds given to ruminants because this kind of feeding practice is believed to have initiated and amplified the outbreak of BSE in the United Kingdom.     Are these actions being taken against Canadian products?   Yes, FDA and USDA have expanded their BSE import restrictions to include Canadian products.    Is BSE, the disease that affects cattle in Europe and has now occurred in a beef cow in Canada, the same as CWD, the disease that affects elk and deer in the US?     Many different ""Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies"" (TSE) exist in different animals (including people).  To date, we have found no evidence that the TSE in cattle (BSE) and the TSE in deer and elk (CWD) are related, but research is continuing.  FDA is working closely with other government agencies and the public health community to address CWD in wild and domesticated herds.   Wildlife and public health officials advise people not to harvest, handle, or consume any wild deer or elk that appear to be sick, regardless of the cause, especially in those states where CWD has been detected.    Is the beef in the U.S. considered safe to eat?   FDA, in collaboration with other federal agencies, has preventive measures already in place to reduce the American consumer's risk of exposure. There is no evidence that BSE has infected U. S. cattle, and FDA continues to implement policies to prevent exposure to the public through FDA regulated products, including food, food ingredients, dietary supplements and cosmetics that contain bovine materials.    How is BSE spread among cattle?   It is believed that BSE is spread when cattle eat animal feed that contains the mammalian protein from other infected rendered animals.  FDA, with its feed ban, has restricted the use of rendered mammals in ruminant feed.     What is being done to prevent Canadian products that may be contaminated with BSE from entering the United States?   The risk to human health resulting from the BSE-infected cow in Canada is extremely small, if it exists at all; no meat from this animal entered the human food supply.   When this case was reported from Canada, FDA and USDA reacted immediately.  USDA added Canada to its BSE restricted countries list, and USDA and FDA expanded their restrictions on imports from BSE countries to Canadian products.     FDA will continue to work with USDA to stop a wide variety of products (animal feed, human food) with bovine-derived materials from being imported into the U.S. from BSE restricted countries, including Canada.  In addition, both FDA and USDA are cooperating with the Customs Service to ensure food safety at the border.         This document was issued in May 2003.

BSE appears to be spread through the feeding of infected material to cattle. BSE is a public health issue for the U.S. This disease has been linked to the human TSE known as variant CreutzfeldtJakob Disease (vCJD), presumably through people consuming ruminant tissues infected with the BSE agent. In addition, BSE has had a devastating economic effect on the livestock industry in countries where it has been identified or suspected. On August 4, 1997, the ""Animal Proteins Prohibited From Use In Animal Feeds"" regulation, 21 CFR 589.2000, became effective. This regulation is designed to prevent the establishment and amplification of BSE through animal feed, by prohibiting the use of certain proteins derived from mammalian tissue in the feeding of ruminant animals. This regulation affects renderers, protein blenders, commercial animal feed manufacturers, distributors (including retailers), transporters of animal feed and feed ingredients, on-farm animal feed mixers, and ruminant feeders. Based on the acute need to control the entry and spread of this disease, the Agency has set a goal of full compliance with the regulation. At the present time, the causative agent for BSE is not fully understood, although prions are the suspected mode of transmission of this disease. Currently, there is no direct test for the presence of the BSE prion agent in animal feed, feed ingredients, and other animal feed products. In lieu of an FDA-validated test method for detecting the presence of the agent that causes BSE, efforts are focused on prohibiting the inclusion of certain mammalian proteins in ruminant feed. Tests are presently available for identifying mammalian proteins in animal feeds. Feed microscopy is one such test method for mammalian proteins. Feed microscopy analysis is a useful tool to help ensure that product potentially contaminated with prohibited materials does not enter the U.S., and to help assure that domestic and imported products also are not adulterated with prohibited materials. Additional analytical methods are in development. In January 1998, the FDA undertook an initiative to prevent the establishment and amplification of BSE and other TSE's through animal feed. The Agency's approach strongly emphasized education and incorporated training seminars, guidance documents, and the distribution of various written and printed materials. The initiative combined these educational efforts with an inspectional approach to all renderers, feed mills, protein blenders and other firms subject to this regulation. On December 7, 2000, the USDA/APHIS enacted regulations prohibiting on the importation into the United States of all meat and bone meal (MBM), meat meal, bone meal, blood meal, tankage, offal, tallow, or any product containing such, which originated directly from countries identified as having BSE, or from countries having inadequate systems in place to prevent BSE 6 DATE OF ISSUANCE: 10/21/2003 FORM FDA 2438 Page  PROGRAM   FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION COMPLIANCE PROGRAM GUIDANCE MANUAL 7371.009 PROGRAM  (See 9 CFR 94.18 and 9 CFR 95.4). The prohibitions included all products of animal origin that were rendered or processed in these countries, regardless of species of origin, and including poultry and fishmeal unless the material is from a non-ruminant species and meets certain conditions assuring no contamination with ruminant material. These prohibitions were deemed necessary by APHIS because of the possibility of cross contamination with the BSE agent. Subsequently, on January 20, 2001, the FDA issued Import Alert #99-25, ""Detention Without Physical Examination of Animal Feed, Animal Feed Ingredients and Other Products for Animal Use Consisting or Containing Ingredients of Animal Origin."" This compliance program guidance should be used by federal and state investigators to conduct inspections or investigations of renderers, protein blenders, licensed and unlicensed feed manufacturers, distributors, retailers, on-farm feed mixers, and ruminant feeders. The purpose of these inspections is to assess compliance with 21 CFR 589.2000. The program provides guidance for collecting evidence to support regulatory action when non-compliance is found. In addition, this compliance program guidance should be used by import personnel in determining the appropriateness of animal feeds and feed ingredients coming into the United States. Import personnel should ensure that prohibited material does not enter the U.S from BSE-at-risk countries, unless accompanied by all relevant federally required certificates and documentation. Import personnel should also ensure that labeling for products coming in from non-BSE-at-risk countries is in full compliance with 21 CFR 589.2000 and animal feed labeling requirements.  6 DATE OF ISSUANCE: 10/21/2003 FORM FDA 2438 Page   FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION COMPLIANCE PROGRAM GUIDANCE MANUAL 7371.009 Part II - Implementation 1. Objectives. The primary goal of this compliance program is to enhance the FDA's uniformity in inspection and compliance of firms subject to the regulation prohibiting the utilization of specified animal proteins in ruminant feeds, 21 CFR 589.2000. The purpose of these regulations is to prevent the establishment and/or amplification of BSE within the United States. Additional features of the compliance program are as follows:     To provide guidance to federal, state, and local officials for conducting on-site inspections of a variety of firm types, as described by the regulation. To provide guidance for determining the need and type of enforcement action based on inspection findings. To provide guidance on sampling and analytical methods for supporting inspection findings. To emphasize the need for using this compliance program as a part of other inspections and compliance programs that are conducted by federal, state and local officials. PROGRAM  Since the threat of the introduction of BSE within the United States is an ever-present and continuing concern, this compliance program will be used on a continuing basis and incorporated into standard inspectional protocols. 2. Program Management Instructions. a. Inspection Priorities. The first inspectional priority under this program is to inspect those firms that have a violative history that has been classified by the FDA as ""Official Action Indicated"" or OAI. These inspections should be conducted with the intent that regulatory action will be pursued should the firm be unwilling or unable to take immediate actions to correct the violations. 21 CFR 589.2000 pertains to a variety of firms and animal production operations that involve the manufacture, distribution, transportation, and feeding of animal feeds. Although the intent of the rule is to ensure that specified animal proteins are not fed to ruminant animals, the regulation is written broadly in such a way as to include some operations that do not necessarily involve ruminant feeds or the feeding of ruminant animals. Inspectional resources for surveillance are to be spent covering those firms or industries potentially having the most adverse affect on BSE prevention efforts should 6 DATE OF ISSUANCE: 10/21/2003 FORM FDA 2438 Page   FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION COMPLIANCE PROGRAM GUIDANCE MANUAL 7371.009 PROGRAM  non-compliance with the regulations be encountered. In planning and prioritizing inspections, the following firm/industry types should be considered, in order of descending priority:                Follow-up to `OAI' inspections Firms that have a violative history Firms handling prohibited materials (Renderers, Protein Blenders, and Feed Mills) Rendering operations Protein blenders Commercial feed mills (licensed and unlicensed) Animal feed distributors/retailers (ruminant feeds involved) Pet food/animal feed salvage operations On-farm feed mixers (ruminant and non-ruminant animals on farm premises) Haulers/transporters of animal feeds (ruminant feeds involved) Ruminant feeders (dairy cattle) Ruminant feeders (ruminants other than dairy cattle) Animal feed distributors/retailers (no ruminant feeds involved) Haulers/transporters of animal feeds (no ruminant feeds involved) On-farm feed mixers (only ruminant or no ruminant animals on farm premises)  b. Planning Instructions. Inspection planning should generally be based on the priority of firms as listed above. Information should be collected on whether a firm has been documented as receiving, processing or distributing prohibited material. This information can be obtained directly through the FACTS database, and through the BSE District Coordinator. A listing of these firms can also be found through the CVM Website (http://www.fda.gov/cvm/default.html). c. Program Interactions. The success of this program to support the prevention of the introduction and amplification of BSE in the United States is dependent on the ability of investigators to identify violative firms and operations. While initial efforts by Federal and State investigators have identified and inspected most renderers and commercial feed mills, continued efforts are needed to identify and continue to inspect all firms subject to the regulation. Mobile feed mills, animal feed salvagers, feed distributors, feed transporters, and ruminant farms are areas that should receive additional attention. When appropriate, add-on BSE inspections should be conducted under this present program whenever the 6 DATE OF ISSUANCE: 10/21/2003 FORM FDA 2438 Page   FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION COMPLIANCE PROGRAM GUIDANCE MANUAL 7371.009 PROGRAM  opportunity presents itself and resources allow through inspections that are conducted under the following programs: 7318.003 7371.003 7371.004 7371.006 7371.008 Compliance Program Milk Safety Program Feed Contaminants Program Feed Manufacturing Compliance Program Illegal Drug Residues in Meat & Poultry Program National Drug Residue Milk Monitoring Program  Guidance on inspections addressing FDA BSE efforts involving human dietary supplements can be found in the CFSAN-administered, ""Dietary Supplements  Import and Domestic"" compliance program (Compliance Program 7321.008).  6 DATE OF ISSUANCE: 10/21/2003 FORM FDA 2438 Page   FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION COMPLIANCE PROGRAM GUIDANCE MANUAL 7371.009 Part III  Inspectional 1. Operations. a. Definitions. (1) Prohibited Material  Any protein derived from mammalian animals (Examples: meat and bone meal; organs; offal; hair; collagen), with the following exclusions:    Blood and blood products Gelatin Inspected meat product which has been cooked and offered for human food, AND which has been further heat processed for animal feed (Examples: restaurant plate waste; cellulosic food casing; surplus from manufacturers or distributors of human food products that are prepared or offered for sale.) Milk products (Examples: milk; milk-derived products) Any product whose ONLY mammalian protein consists entirely of porcine (pig) or equine (horse) protein. PROGRAM     (2) Non-Prohibited Material  For purposes of clarification, the following materials are not prohibited for use in ruminant feed under 21 CFR 589.2000:    Non-protein ingredients (Examples: fat; amino acids, bone ash; bone phosphate; bone charcoal) Non-mammalian sources of protein (Examples: fish, poultry, vegetable) Products of mammalian origin that are not intended for use in animal feeds or feed ingredients (Example: bone meal labeled for use as a fertilizer)  These examples are not all inclusive. Any questions concerning whether certain ingredients should be considered as prohibited material should be directed to CVM, Division of Compliance. (3) Pet Food  For the purposes of this guidance, pet food is any feed that is commercially prepared and distributed for consumption by pets. A pet is any domesticated animal normally maintained in or near the household(s) of the owner(s) thereof. Examples include dogs, cats, rats, mice, hamsters, gerbils, rabbits, ferrets, nonhuman primates, canaries, psittacine birds, mynahs, finches, tropical fish, goldfish, snakes, and turtles. Horses or other equids are not considered to be pets within this guidance because they are routinely slaughtered for human food. (4) Ruminant - Ruminant includes any member of the order of animals that has a stomach with four chambers (rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum) through 6 DATE OF ISSUANCE: 10/21/2003 FORM FDA 2438 Page   FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION COMPLIANCE PROGRAM GUIDANCE MANUAL 7371.009 PROGRAM  which feed passes in digestion. The order includes, but is not limited to, cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, deer, elk, and antelopes. (5) Renderer - Renderer means any firm or individual that processes slaughter byproducts, animals unfit for human consumption or meat scraps. The term includes persons who:  Collect such materials and subject them only to minimal processing. With respect to rendering practices, ""minimal processing"" should be considered as the process of applying heat to raw materials for the purpose of removing the moisture and fat from the solid protein portion of animal tissues. Collect such materials and distribute them to firms other than renderers (as defined here) whose intended use for the products may include animal feed. This definition should be interpreted to include any firm or individual that provides ingredients or raw materials to a pet food manufacturer, regardless of whether the material has been minimally processed. Are renderers that also blend animal protein products.      Collectors are generally not subject to the regulation since (1) they do not minimally process their collected animal waste materials; and (2) they distribute their collected animal waste materials only to renderers. However, any collector who additionally distributes collected material directly to a non-rendering firm (e.g., a pet food manufacturer) should also be considered a renderer under 21 CFR 589.2000(a)(2), and, therefore, subject to the full provisions of the regulation. While pet food manufacturing may involve the application of heat to raw materials, pet food manufacturing operations are not generally considered as rendering, unless the purpose of the process is to produce product that contains a stable protein ingredient. Cooking is not necessarily synonymous with rendering. As such, collectors or firms distributing animal waste materials directly to pet food manufacturers should not seek to avoid the requirements of 21 CFR 589.2000(d) by claiming that the pet food manufacture destination solely consists of rendering operations. Slaughter facilities do not collect animal waste materials, but rather generate these materials as byproducts of their operations. In contrast, dead stock processing operations (e.g., 4-D plants) are subject to the regulation, since they process animal waste materials or byproducts (e.g. dead animals, animal carcasses), but do not produce them themselves. The rule regulates firms beginning at the level of the renderer. Outgoing materials from inspected slaughter facilities, therefore, do not require the caution statement under the regulation, regardless of their destination. However, we recognize that in some instances, both slaughter and rendering 6 DATE OF ISSUANCE: 10/21/2003 FORM FDA 2438 Page   FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION COMPLIANCE PROGRAM GUIDANCE MANUAL 7371.009 PROGRAM  operations may take place on the same premises. In these instances, the regulation will apply to all operations that occur within the recognized rendering facilities. In general, a slaughterhouse, collector, dealer, hauler or anyone else who supplies a renderer with material to be rendered is not subject to the specific requirements of this regulation. However, the renderer has a responsibility to seek assurance from the supplier of non-prohibited material that the nonmammalian, pure porcine or pure equine materials come from single-species slaughter facilities. Assurance might include a certificate from the supplier, or specification of source in a business contract. Note: Collectors are generally not subject to the regulation since (1) they do not minimally process their collected animal waste materials; and (2) they distribute their collected animal waste materials only to renderers. Collecting activities might include processes such as skinning, salting, cutting, or trimming. Nevertheless, while collectors may not be subject to the regulation, the responsibility is placed on renderers to ensure that all carcasses and waste products obtained from collectors indeed do not contain any prohibited material. This could include a certification from the supplier, or specification of source in a business contract. (6) Feed Manufacturer - Feed manufacturer includes manufacturers of complete and intermediate feeds intended for animals, and includes on-farm, in addition to offfarm, feed manufacturing and mixing operations. The term includes manufacturers of pet food and laboratory animal feed. (7) Distributor - Distributors include persons who distribute or transport feeds or feed ingredients intended for animals. The term includes retailers of feeds and feed products; the distribution activities of blenders and feed manufacturers; and transporters of animal feed and feed ingredients. (8) Transporter  Transportation may occur by roads, rails, water or air. While the regulation covers all transportation activities, inspectional efforts should be preferentially directed to activities in which loose or bulk animal feeds or feed ingredients are handled, since these activities may result in commingling or crosscontamination of feeds not containing prohibited materials with feeds containing prohibited material. (9) Ruminant Feeder  A ruminant feeder is any establishment or individual that is responsible for feeding ruminant animals. Examples include, but are not limited to: dairies, cattle feedlots, calf and lamb raising operations, and the general feeding of ruminants, such as cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, deer, elk, and antelopes. 6 DATE OF ISSUANCE: 10/21/2003 FORM FDA 2438 Page   FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION COMPLIANCE PROGRAM GUIDANCE MANUAL 7371.009 b. Domestic Inspection Approach. Investigators are encouraged to use their knowledge, training, and experience in assessing compliance with the BSE regulations, as the requirements pertain to a wide variety of firm types. Although inspections will focus on key operational areas such as raw materials, processing methods and equipment, record keeping and labeling, investigators are cautioned to be alert and pursue any information that might indicate a potential violation of 21 CFR 589.2000. Investigators are expected to assess current systems of the firm (operational practices and procedures), to ensure they are effective and being followed. The results of inspections conducted under this program should be recorded on the checklist (See Attachment B), and violative observations noted in the FDA form 483, AND fully described in the EIR. Federal-State Interactions - Districts are strongly encouraged to work with their State counterparts in trying to address any violative situation through a joint State enforcement approach. If a District encounters a violative operation that does not engage in interstate commerce and the State is unable to take action, contact CVM, Division of Compliance for further instructions. Examples of when State involvement should be considered include:     Obtaining embargoes or stop-sale orders in advance of a seizure; Seeking state intervention if their laws or regulations can lead to removal of product from distribution channels in a more expedient manner; Obtaining suspension or withdrawal of a State feed manufacturing license; When interstate commerce cannot be established. PROGRAM  6 DATE OF ISSUANCE: 10/21/2003 FORM FDA 2438 Page   FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION COMPLIANCE PROGRAM GUIDANCE MANUAL 7371.009 Conducting a Domestic Inspection: (1) Does the firm receive and/or process prohibited material? In obtaining an answer to this question, also ask   What kind of protein do they receive? If they receive mammalian protein, what kind of mammalian protein? PROGRAM  If the answer to question (1) is NO or DON'T KNOW, proceed to Section (1)(a). If the answer to question (1) is YES, proceed to Section (1)(b). Note: If this is an initial inspection, be sure to discuss the requirements of the BSE regulation and leave a copy of the regulation and appropriate Small Entities Compliance Guides, which are located on the CVM website. (a) Does the firm handle prohibited material?  NO or DON'T KNOW If the answer to (1) Is NO, they do not receive and/or process prohibited material, OR they do not know, verify the firm's status by means of the following: i. Inspect the facility, carefully observing the materials in the receiving and storage areas. Pay particular attention to the raw material coming in and any material waiting to be processed. ii. Do you see any prohibited material? If YES, copy the records showing receipt of this material, including, if available, documentation of inter-state commerce, document for possible enforcement action, and proceed to Section (1)(b). iii. Review a representative number of the firm's receiving records and/or invoices for the incoming material, going back up to one year or to the last inspection date. Do these records show receipt of prohibited material? If YES, copy the records, begin documenting for possible enforcement action, and proceed to Section (1)(b). iv. If the firm is a renderer, protein blender, or feed mill, list and document all animal species for which feeds are manufactured by the firm. Does the firm manufacture and/or distribute feed or feed ingredients intended for ruminant animals? DATE OF ISSUANCE: 10/21/2003 FORM FDA 2438 Page   FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION COMPLIANCE PROGRAM GUIDANCE MANUAL 7371.009 PROGRAM  v. Determine what procedures or safeguards, if any, the firm has in place to ensure it does not receive prohibited material. Describe the safeguards or procedures in your report. Examples of safeguards and procedures are as follows:      (b) Written assurance from supplier that they no longer manufacture any products containing prohibited materials Labeling review of incoming materials Uses only vegetable source proteins Uses pure animal proteins only from exempted sources (examples: porcine, equine, poultry, fish, gelatin) Analyzes incoming product Does the firm handle prohibited material?  YES i. Obtain information about the source of the prohibited material. Is it from a domestic, single source? Is it from a domestic, mixed source? Is it from a foreign source and if so, from what country or countries? Note: The firm bears the burden of ensuring the safety of its products. This includes the ability to identify the source of the prohibited material. ii. Inspect the facility, carefully observing the materials in the receiving and storage areas. Pay particular attention to the raw material coming in and any material waiting to be processed. iii. List and document all the species for which animals feeds are manufactured by the firm. iv. The remaining inspection should focus on the three primary aspects of the regulation:    Label caution statement requirement Recordkeeping requirements Requirements for avoiding commingling  DATE OF ISSUANCE: 10/21/2003 FORM FDA 2438  Page   FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION COMPLIANCE PROGRAM GUIDANCE MANUAL 7371.009 v. Label Caution Statement A. Review a representative copy of the label for each INCOMING product (raw materials and finished products) that contains prohibited material. Note whether each label bears the required caution statement, ""Do not feed to cattle or other ruminants.'' In the case of raw or bulk ingredients, labeling may consist of a placard or other labels attached to the invoice or delivery ticket, or manufacturer's invoice that identifies the animal feed or feed ingredient. If the required caution statement is not present, collect copies of all violative labels, document for possible enforcement action, and perform a trace back/trace forward as indicated by the findings. If, through tracing, it is determined that prohibited material was used in the production of ruminant feeds or was fed to ruminants, proceed to document for legal action and as directed under the BSE recall strategy (See Part V  Section 3, ""Recalls""). Note: Since collectors who do not minimally process their collected animal waste materials AND who distribute their collected animal waste materials only to renderers are not subject to 21 CFR 589.2000, prohibited materials received by renderers from collectors are not expected to bear the caution statement. Note: All products received at pet food/animal feed salvagers that contain or may contain prohibited material must bear the required caution statement. Only pet food that is intended for retail sale and nonrumimant laboratory animal feed are exempt from this requirement. Pet foods sold as distressed or salvaged items are not considered intended for retail sale as pet foods, and therefore must be labeled with the required caution statement. B. Review a representative copy of the label for each OUTGOING product that contains prohibited material. Note whether each label bears the required caution statement, ""Do not feed to cattle or other ruminants.'' In the case of raw or bulk ingredients, labeling may consist of a placard or other labels attached to the invoice or delivery ticket, or manufacturer's invoice that identifies the animal feed or feed ingredient. If the required caution statement is not present, document for possible enforcement action, and perform a trace back/trace forward as indicated by the findings. If through tracing, it is determined that prohibited material was used in the production of ruminant feeds or was fed to ruminant animals, DATE OF ISSUANCE: 10/21/2003 FORM FDA 2438 Page  PROGRAM   FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION COMPLIANCE PROGRAM GUIDANCE MANUAL 7371.009 PROGRAM  proceed with evidence collection to support legal action and as directed under the BSE recall strategy (See Part V  Section 3, ""Recalls""). Is the caution statement displayed in a conspicuous or prominent manner? If the answer is NO, collect evidence for evaluation. Discuss with the firm as to their rationale or intent in displaying the statement in this manner. Note: Only pet food that is intended for retail sale and nonrumimant laboratory animal feed are exempt from the caution statement requirement. Pet foods sold as distressed or salvaged items are no longer intended for retail sale as pet foods, and therefore must be labeled with the required caution statement. Manufacturers, distributors and retailers of pet food should be evaluated for existing procedures/controls to ensure that the required caution statement is placed on pet foods that are salvaged or distressed. Product for Export - Prohibited material products destined for export must be labeled that they are intended for export, such as with the statement, ""For Export Only."" This marking should be clear and conspicuous. The label should be placed on the shipping packages or, if the exported product does not have a shipping package or container, on shipping invoices or other documents accompanying the exported product, as allowed under 21 CFR 1.101(b)(3). Other legal requirements for exported products should also be met. The caution statement is not required on products for export. Any prohibited material product that was destined for export but is diverted back into domestic commerce for any reason (e.g. salvage, quality), will be subject to all the requirements of the regulation. vi. Recordkeeping A. Review a representative number of receipt, processing, and distribution records for incoming prohibited material AND outgoing processed product containing the prohibited material. Records may include invoices, receiving tickets, receiving logs,  DATE OF ISSUANCE: 10/21/2003 FORM FDA 2438  Page   FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION COMPLIANCE PROGRAM GUIDANCE MANUAL 7371.009 PROGRAM  disbursement records, weight tickets, purchase orders, and other business records or documents. An invoice or other similar document reflecting receipt purchase, and sale or delivery of the products usually satisfies requirement by the firm. The documents should be available inspection and copying. Specifically, you should note whether documents include:      of this for the  Date of receipt or purchase or sale or delivery of the product Name and address of the seller Name and address of the consignee Identification of the product Quantity of the product  Note additionally whether ONLY retail sales of prohibited material are involved. You should take into consideration whether recording the name and address of the consignee may not be feasible or practical for firms that are only involved with retail sales. B. The firm must maintain records sufficient to track the prohibited material through the receipt, processing and distribution of the feed material, and make these records available for inspection and copying per 21 CFR 589.2000(c)(1)(ii), and also required by 21 CFR 589.2000(d)(1) and 21 CFR 589.2000(e)(1)(i). The required records must be kept for a minimum of one year per 21 CFR 589.2000(h)(1). More specifically, all records related to the receipt, processing, and distribution of a single outgoing product should be retained on the premises for not less than one year after the date of the shipment of the product. The records should be legible and kept in a clean and orderly manner. Note: Pet food that is intended for retail sale and non-ruminant laboratory animal feed is exempt ONLY from the caution statement requirement. All firms manufacturing and/or distributing pet food and non-ruminant laboratory animal feed are subject to ALL recordkeeping requirements described above per 21 CFR 589.2000(c)(1)(ii), as required by 21 CFR 589.2000(d)(1) and 21 CFR 589.2000(e)(1)(i).  DATE OF ISSUANCE: 10/21/2003 FORM FDA 2438  Page   FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION COMPLIANCE PROGRAM GUIDANCE MANUAL 7371.009 PROGRAM  C. If the firm fails to meet some or all of the above requirements, document for possible enforcement action. D. Records of the interstate movement of food and the holding thereof during and after such movement must be made available for inspection and copying under Section 704 of the Act. Should the firm refuse access to or copying of such records, Districts should contact the FDA/Office of Enforcement (OE) to determine whether it would be appropriate to obtain an inspection warrant under Section 704. The investigator should first make a verbal request for the records. If this request is refused, recommend to OE/DCMO that an administrative inspection warrant be obtained to gain access to the required records (See Chapter 6, Regulatory Procedures Manual (RPM)) for instructions on recommending inspection warrants). E. These records are used to determine current compliance with the rule. If there are NO RECORDS, document for possible enforcement action vii. Avoiding Commingling A) Determine whether the firm manufactures, processes, blends and distributes BOTH products containing prohibited material AND products containing only non-prohibited materials. If the answer is YES, consider the following: The firm can only avoid commingling or cross-contamination of ruminant feed with prohibited material by one of two methods, either:   the use of separate equipment [21 CFR 589.2000(e)(1)(iii)(A)]; or the use of the same equipment with adequate clean-out procedures that prevent carry-over of prohibited material into the ruminant feed [21 CFR 589.2000(e)(1)(iii)(B)]  B) Inspect incoming material receipt and storage areas, product processing and finished product storage areas. Describe the separation system and procedures to avoid commingling and cross contamination (dust control, separate equipment and/or buildings,  DATE OF ISSUANCE: 10/21/2003 FORM FDA 2438  Page   FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION COMPLIANCE PROGRAM GUIDANCE MANUAL 7371.009 PROGRAM  and other controls on incoming and finished product identification and storage). C) For Renderers, determine whether the firm receives nonprohibited material that consists ONLY of non-mammalian protein, pure pork, or pure-equine materials from single-species slaughter facilities, as is required by 21 CFR 589.2000(e)(1)(ii). D) Firms Avoiding Commingling with Separate Equipment  Firms might use separate equipment or facilities for the intended manufacture, processing, and blending (including storage) of products containing prohibited material AND products containing only non-prohibited materials. Separation can consist of entirely separate buildings, rooms or other locations; or separate storage containers for incoming material and finished product, and separate manufacturing lines. Separate equipment should be clearly identified to ensure that prohibited material is not accidentally added to non-prohibited material production runs. E) Firms Avoiding Commingling with Adequate Clean-out Procedures - If the same equipment is shared for BOTH products containing prohibited material AND products containing only nonprohibited material, describe the clean-out procedures. Clean-out can consist of physical cleaning (e.g. vacuuming, sweeping, washing), flushing, sequencing, or other means, either alone or in combination with separation measures, that are adequate to prevent carryover of prohibited material into runs that are intended to be free of prohibited material. Clean-out procedures should be used on all equipment and conveyances (e.g. trucks, rail cars) that handle both prohibited material and non-prohibited material. Flushing with a complete change of operating volume will generally be considered as adequate clean-out. However, other practices used by the firm may also be considered as adequate clean-out. These firms should consider the unique characteristics of their operational equipment in determining alternative clean-out procedures. Any practice ultimately used for cleaning out the system should be based on a documented rationale, analysis, or tests by the firm of the adequacy of the clean-out process. Try to obtain documentation of sequencing practices. DATE OF ISSUANCE: 10/21/2003 FORM FDA 2438 Page   FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION COMPLIANCE PROGRAM GUIDANCE MANUAL 7371.009 PROGRAM  Flushing procedures, in particular, should take into account the type of flush material used, and the time and volume requirements of the flush as is appropriate for the operational equipment. Firms should also have documented procedures describing how the flush materials are subsequently processed, including storage and labeling of the materials, utilization in other feeds, and/or appropriate disposal (e.g., incineration, landfill). Determine whether the firm maintains written procedures or SOPs specifying all aspects of clean-out and other practices for separating prohibited material from non-prohibited material from the time of receipt until the time of shipment as required in 21 CFR 589.2000(e)(1)(iv) and, if so, try to collect a copy of the SOPs. SOPs or documentation for clean-out should include:      how the clean-out is implemented; who is responsible; how the clean-out is monitored, recorded, and verified; a description of how flush material is subsequently handled; the rationale, analysis or test for determining the adequacy of the clean-out process.  F) If the inspection finds no controls or inadequate controls in place to prevent commingling or cross-contamination between product containing prohibited material and product containing nonprohibited material, document the violation(s) for regulatory action.  DATE OF ISSUANCE: 10/21/2003 FORM FDA 2438  Page   FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION COMPLIANCE PROGRAM GUIDANCE MANUAL 7371.009 (2) Ruminant Feeders. The regulation, 21 CFR 589.2000(f), requires that ruminant feeders:     Maintain received; Maintain Make all Maintain copies of purchase invoices of all feeds containing animal proteins labeling for all feeds containing animal protein products received; copies available for inspection and copying; these records for a minimum of one year. PROGRAM  The primary intent of 21 CFR 589.2000 is to prevent prohibited material products being fed or recycled back to ruminant animals. However, the above regulatory requirements for ruminant feeders primarily address recordkeeping, and do not directly address some of the feeding and storage practices that occur in ruminant operations. The investigator should be aware of the actual requirements under this regulation. Nevertheless, the investigator should take the opportunity to observe whether on-farm practices are sufficient for ensuring that prohibited material is not fed, intentionally or unintentionally, to ruminant animals. While the regulation may not necessarily address all aspects of the following observational areas, the investigator should nevertheless consider discussing the importance of these areas with the ruminant feeder. a. Prohibited Material. The investigator should determine whether any feed containing prohibited material is present on the farm premises. 21 CFR 589.2000(f) states that establishments and individuals are responsible for maintaining copies of purchase invoices and labeling for all feeds containing animal protein products received. Investigators encountering situations where prohibited material has been fed to ruminants should consult with CVM. CVM will consult with the USDA, Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) for determining the most appropriate course of regulatory action.  DATE OF ISSUANCE: 10/21/2003 FORM FDA 2438  Page   FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION COMPLIANCE PROGRAM GUIDANCE MANUAL 7371.009 b. Feed Storage. Feed storage, particularly in operations where both ruminant and non-ruminant species are being fed, should be examined. If ruminant feeds and non-ruminant feeds are stored in the same location, the investigator should note the procedures used for ensuring that ruminant animals are not fed non-ruminant feeds and should take photographs or draw diagrams of feed bins and equipment. In particular, investigators should note whether:  Feed bins are labeled to identify ruminant and non-ruminant feed. (This is not required by 21 CFR 589.2000 but will help the investigator determine whether ruminants have been fed non-ruminant feed.)  Bulk feeds for ruminants are separated from non-ruminant feeds for preventing mix-up, commingling and/or cross-contamination (This is not required by 21 CFR 589.2000 but will help the investigator determine whether ruminants have been fed non-ruminant feed.)  Transportation and feed equipment handling both ruminant and non-ruminant feeds is either separate or adequately cleaned (See Section (2)(c)). c. OnFarm Mixing. Special attention should be placed on farm operations that are mixing rations for both ruminant and non-ruminant animals particularly if prohibited materials are contained in any of the feeds or feed ingredients. On-farm mixing operations should be examined in a manner and to an extent similar to that for commercial feed mills.

(a) Records of the interstate movement of food and the holding thereof during and after such movement must be made available for inspection and copying under Sections 703 and/or 704 of the Act. Should the firm refuse access to or copying of such records, Districts should contact the FDA/Office of Enforcement (OE) to determine whether it would be appropriate to obtain an inspection warrant under Section 704. If, however, FDA relies on Section 703 to inspect the records, the agency may not use the records or any evidence derived from the records in a criminal prosecution of the person from whom the records were obtained. The investigator should first make a verbal request for the records. If this request is refused, recommend to OE that an administrative inspection warrant be obtained to gain access to the required records (See Chapter 6, Regulatory Procedures Manual (RPM)) for instructions on recommending inspection warrants). (b) Any violation of the requirements of 21 CFR 589.2000 should be listed on the FDA-483 and fully documented. Collect documentary (DOC) samples to support possible regulatory action. (See IOM, Chapter 4 for instructions on collecting DOC samples.) (c) All violations of 21 CFR 589.2000 should be considered as potentially serious. However, in consideration of the wide variety of violative situations possible, the investigator should use the attached prioritized listing of possible situations (See Part V, Section 2c  Prioritized Inspectional Violative Situations). The investigator should note the observations and collect documentary samples required for each situation. (d) Certain violative situations may later require feed analysis to determine whether the suspect feed or feed ingredient may contain prohibited material. In anticipation of case development, the investigator should consider obtaining feed samples for analysis (See Part IV  Analytical).

(a) Checklist - Report of Inspection For Compliance With 21 CFR 589.2000. The checklist entitled, ""Report of Inspection For Compliance With 21 CFR 589.2000 (See Attachment B),"" should be completed for all inspections or investigations conducted under this Compliance Program. The most recent version of the checklist is available at the CVM Website (http://www.fda.gov/cvm/index/bse/RuminantFeedInspections.htm). Periodically reference this Website to ensure that you are using the most current version. The checklist is accompanied by instructions. The difficulties in using a simple checklist to adequately describe the operations of a large variety of firm types necessitate that the instructions be understood. All investigators should be provided with a copy of the checklist that includes these instructions. The primary purpose of the checklist is to provide general guidance to investigators to assess firm operations and to facilitate quality assurance in the administration of this Compliance Program. While all deviations from the Ruminant Feed Ban regulation should be clearly noted on the checklist, investigators should not depend solely on the checklist to determine compliance status. Ascertaining the initial classification of compliance status will depend primarily on the experience of the investigator and familiarity with this Compliance Program, with subsequent supervisory and compliance review. Districts are responsible for archiving all inspectional documents and for entering information into FACTS. No materials should be sent to CVM, unless otherwise requested. All completed checklists, along with endorsed EIRs or memos of investigation, and FDA-483 forms should be sent by States to the FDA District BSE Monitor and not to CVM. The BSE District Monitors, or their designees, will be responsible for checking the State checklists and inspectional information for completeness and accuracy. Timeliness of entry into FACTS should take into consideration the type of violations that were noted during the inspections. In general, inspections and checklists for violative firms should be entered into FACTS within ten (10) days after receipt. Checklists for FDA-conducted inspections should be entered into FACTS by the lead investigator. Checklists for State-conducted inspections should be entered into FACTS by District personnel having the appropriate FACTS BSE entry role. The anticipated development of the new e-SAF system (electronic State access to PROGRAM  DATE OF ISSUANCE: 10/21/2003 FORM FDA 2438  Page   FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION COMPLIANCE PROGRAM GUIDANCE MANUAL 7371.009 PROGRAM  FACTS) should provide States with the capability of direct checklist input into the FACTS system. The full and accurate completion of the checklist is essential to successfully maintain this compliance program. Entry of the checklist information allows for further analysis of inspectional findings on a nationwide basis. In addition to identifying firms requiring additional enforcement action, the database allows for trend analysis of certain segments of the industry and of compliance with certain aspects of the Ruminant Feed Rule. No inspections or investigations conducted under this program can have an administrative status of `completed' unless an accompanying checklist has been entered into the FACTS system. Similarly, based on database design requirements, incomplete checklists cannot be entered into the FACTS module. The checklists and other information submitted under this program are used solely within the confines of this Compliance Program. Information that pertains to other Compliance Programs or FDA activities generally will not be forwarded to those respective programs. Information should not be submitted that is intended for review under other compliance programs. Copies should be made of all necessary documents for simultaneous submission to those other programs, as required. (b) Other Reporting Requirements. Be sure to report time spent on the inspection under the PAC Code for BSE inspections. Note that the FACTS BSE module will not be available unless a BSE PAC code has been identified on the FACTS inspectional coversheet. If the inspection covers multiple programs, report time spent on this part of the inspection separately. Individual FDA District Offices and States may have additional reporting requirements. Any questions or problems that arise concerning inspections, reporting, or enforcement issues should be directed to the contacts listed in this program (See Part VI  Section 1, ""Program Contacts"").

(1) BSE affected and BSE-at-risk countries Import Alert #99-25 (""Detention Without Physical Examination of Animal Feed, Animal Feed Ingredients and Other Products for Animal Use Consisting or Containing Ingredients of Animal Origin"") describes FDA's import enforcement efforts to detain products that appear to violate 21 CFR  589.2000 and to support the USDA/APHIS prohibition of the importation of animal feed products that present a risk of BSE. (See 9 CFR 94.18 and 9 CFR 95.4). The import alert covers all meat and bone meal (MBM), meat meal, bonemeal, blood meal, tankage, offal, or any product containing such from countries in which BSE exists or from designated BSEat risk countries or that was rendered/processed in BSE at-risk countries' plants processing animal materials, regardless of species of origin, including poultry and fish meal. In implementing the Import Alert, import entry reviewers should consider the following:  The Import Alert addresses all sources of animal protein, including non-ruminant, fish, poultry, and all non-mammalian sources without regard to the prohibited material exemptions provided in 21 CFR 589.200(a)(1). The USDA/APHIS Import Permit process is the primary means of assuring that animal byproduct meals imported from BSE-at-risk countries into the U.S. are free of ruminant protein sources. Unprocessed non-ruminant products that are in a form that can be plainly ascertained through direct observation to be free of ruminant material (e.g., frozen whole fish, dried pig ears) should not be considered ""Detained Without Physical Examination"" (DWPE), as directed by the Import Alert. Import entry reviewers, however, should be vigilant to attempts to intentionally smuggle ruminant-source products into shipments of unprocessed non-ruminant material. All product codes addressed by the Import Alert should be reviewed, including pet foods, amino acids, and the various dietary supplements. Ingredient listing should be examined, whenever available. All incidents involving the entry of products addressed by the Import Alert should be considered as serious and warranting assessment under the BSE Recall Strategy (See Part V  Section 3, ""Recalls""). PROGRAM        DATE OF ISSUANCE: 10/21/2003 FORM FDA 2438  Page   FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION COMPLIANCE PROGRAM GUIDANCE MANUAL 7371.009 (2) Non-BSE at-risk countries Countries, other than those listed in Import Alert #99-25, are not subject to the import prohibition. Nonetheless, import entry reviewers should ensure that all animal feed and feed ingredients that contain or may contain prohibited material are in compliance with the label caution statement requirements of the 21 CFR 589.2000 (See Part III  Section 1b(1)(b)v, ""Label Caution Statement""). Regardless, feed and feed ingredient labeling should be in compliance with FDA labeling requirements. Import entry reviewers should especially ensure that ingredient listings meet U.S. requirements and sufficiently allow reviewers to ascertain whether the product contains or may contain prohibited material. Reviewers especially need to be vigilant for transshipments of products that may have originated in the BSE-at-risk countries and countries with BSE listed in the Import Alert.

Samples should be analyzed for the presence of animal tissue using the feed microscopy procedure outlined in ""Modified AOAC Official Method 964.07, Microscopy of Animal Feed, Basic Microscopic Examination"" (Attachment C), and ""Modified AOAC Official Method 970.09, Microscopy of Animal Feed, Identification of Mammalian Tissues and Mineral Constituents"" (Attachment D), with the following modifications: 1) It is not necessary to determine the weight of animal tissue fragments found 2) Filters may be wet with glycerin/alcohol to prevent loss of dry material in airflow 3) No action should be taken based on normal filth items such as rodent hair or excreta. Identification of ruminant hair would warrant Lab Classification 2, so hair identification is desirable. The presence of hair or excreta from rodents, cats, dogs, humans, and other species would not be considered for classification of the sample. 4) Analysis should be based on a composite of the subs in each sample. Note: Samples collected according to the sampling instructions above should already be composited when received by the lab. 5) Violative or potentially violative findings should be confirmed by a second analyst. Check analysis (i.e., analysis of a new portion of composite) is not required. 2. Sample Size a. If the product is in bulk, collect sixteen (16) one-ounce subs from various locations in the shipment. The sample subs should be combined in one whirl-pak bag. b. If the product is in discrete retail packages (i.e., may be as large as 50 lb. bags), collect one (1) one-ounce sub from each of sixteen (16) retail packages. Combine the subs in one whirl-pak bag. CAUTION: This material may be dusty and consist of fine particles, especially if the product is in bulk. Exercise appropriate precautions when collecting samples of dusty, loose material.

Enforcement Although much of the industry has complied with the regulations as a result of education and voluntary compliance, inspections still occasionally reveal that some firms are not in compliance with 21 CFR 589.2000. Districts should prioritize their resources for dealing with these non-compliant firms before initiating routine inspections. Since analytical methods currently available do not quantify the level of prohibited material in animal feed, inspectional observations, admissions, photographs, and record review are the primary tools for documenting violations. Whenever potentially violative conditions are found, evidence should be collected to support enforcement action. There may be situations in which a firm or individual is new to the industry and does not know of the dangers/hazards of BSE or of FDA's expectations for compliance with the regulation. In these situations, the agency believes the individual or firm should have known the dangers or hazards and our expectations, or they should not be in the business of handling or manufacturing animal feed or feed ingredients. If such a situation is encountered, or if a previously compliant firm is subsequently found to be out of compliance, Districts might consider issuing a Warning Letter or initiating other enforcement actions (See Section 2d, ""Provisions for Enforcement Action""). All Warning Letters proposals will be reviewed by the centers. Firms that receive Warning Letters should be re-inspected within 90 days to verify that corrections have been fully implemented. District offices should review current instructions regarding the review and processing of warning letters prior to issuance. Follow FDA's regulations and procedures prior to sharing non-public information with the public, or federal, state, local, and foreign government officials. NOTE: Warning Letters should be considered for situations that involve violations that are classified as ""Official Action Indicated,"" or OAI. See Section 2c, ""Prioritized Inspectional Violative Situations"" for determining the appropriateness of a Warning Letter. See Section 2d, ""Provisions for Enforcement Action"" for the level of documentation that would be required for other types of enforcement actions.

Adulteration - Sections 402(a)(2)(C) and 402(a)(4) It is easier to bring the Act than under ingredient is legally be on establishing a an adulteration case under the legal standard of Section 402(a)(2)(C) of Section 402(a)(4) of the Act because in the food additive context the presumed to be unsafe. Consequently, the investigator's priority should violation of Section 402(a)(2)(C). PROGRAM  (1) Animal proteins prohibited from use in ruminant feeds are unapproved food additives as defined in section 201(s) of the Act. Therefore, the presence of such material(s) in ruminant feed causes the feed to be adulterated under Section 402(a)(2)(C) of the Act. This charge may be supported by evidence showing that prohibited material is being used frequently or regularly as an ingredient in ruminant feed or feed supplements, or that clean out and sequencing procedures are so inadequate that it is highly likely that the feeds will contain prohibited material. In order to support this charge, documentary evidence should be available to establish that the suspect ruminant feed or ingredient contains or likely contains prohibited material. (2) Animal feeds and feed ingredients containing prohibited material are considered potentially injurious to ruminant and public health. Therefore the use of such material(s) in ruminant feed causes the feed to be adulterated under section 402(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (Act). In order to support this charge, documentary evidence should be available to establish that the suspect ruminant feed or ingredient contains or may contain prohibited material. Investigators should collect supporting records documenting the labeling of the prohibited material(s) and finished product, receipt and use of the prohibited material in the production of the sampled product, and affidavits from responsible individual(s). b. Misbranding (1) Animal feeds and feed ingredients that contain prohibited material but fail to bear the required caution statement are misbranded under section 403(a)(1) of the Act, in that the label is false and misleading because it failed to disclose a material fact, (See 201(n)). (2) Animal feeds and feed ingredients that contain prohibited material but fail to bear the required caution statement in a conspicuous or prominent manner are misbranded under section 403(f) of the Act.

Prioritized Inspectional Violative Situations:  OAI - Evidence that prohibited material is being used as an ingredient in ruminant feed or feed supplements. [NOTE: Addition of the caution statement at the time of inspection will not rectify this violation. The violation should be noted, regardless of any immediate corrective actions.] OAI - Failure to have any or having only grossly inadequate systems/measures in place to prevent commingling and cross-contamination when firm handles prohibited material and produces both ruminant and non-ruminant feed. OAI - Firm has but fails to follow its written systems/measures to prevent commingling and cross-contamination when firm handles prohibited material and produces both ruminant and non-ruminant feed. OAI - Failure to perform any clean-out, flush, and/or follow a sequencing plan to prevent commingling and cross-contamination when firm handles prohibited material and produces both ruminant and non-ruminant feed. OAI - The clean-out, flushing, and/or sequencing plan firm uses to prevent commingling and cross-contamination is not adequate; firm handles prohibited material and produces both ruminant and non-ruminant feed. OAI - The clean-out, flushing, and/or sequencing plan firm uses to prevent commingling and cross-contamination is not performed on an appropriate, routine basis; firm handles prohibited material and produces both ruminant and non-ruminant feed. OAI  Renderer intentionally separates mammalian and nonmammalian materials and fails to obtain and use non-mammalian [e.g., fish or poultry], or pure pork, or pure equine material from a single species slaughter facility. OAI - Evidence that prohibited material is being used frequently or regularly as a component of a feed ingredient or as an ingredient in non-ruminant feed with no caution statement. VAI - Firm has systems/measures in place to prevent commingling and crosscontamination but does not have those measures in writing, when firm handles prohibited material and produces both ruminant and non-ruminant feed [i.e., firm has plan but it is not in writing]. VAI - Failure to maintain records to track prohibited material throughout its Page  PROGRAM                    DATE OF ISSUANCE: 10/21/2003 FORM FDA 2438   FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION COMPLIANCE PROGRAM GUIDANCE MANUAL 7371.009 receipt, processing, and distribution.

PROGRAM  DATE OF ISSUANCE: 10/21/2003 FORM FDA 2438  Page   FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION COMPLIANCE PROGRAM GUIDANCE MANUAL 7371.009 d. Provisions for Enforcement Action: When conducting an inspection to determine compliance with 21 CFR 589.2000, be prepared to document significant violations for possible enforcement action. The basis of the regulation is that certain mammalian proteins, specifically prohibited materials, are unsafe food additives in ruminant feed. Inspectional efforts and documentation should be focused on demonstrating the actual or likely inclusion of those unsafe food additives in ruminant feed and/or the failure to properly label feeds containing this material. If the violative feeds are still available, discuss the firm's intentions to rectify the situation. If the firm does not plan on destruction and/or a recall, consider the possibility of a seizure, injunction and State actions, such as embargo or stop sale. Seizures should be limited to situations where there is clear documentation that ruminant feed has likely been contaminated with prohibited material. Injunction should be considered in situations where there is evidence that the firm has not corrected its violative practices, or there is reason to believe that it will not correct its violative practices. The following information will be important in supporting and demonstrating the conclusion that prohibited material is or is likely to be present in products manufactured, processed, or distributed by the firm or individual being inspected. Make every attempt to obtain or determine the following:              Volume of product produced Frequency of production Describe the records kept to show product/ingredient use Number of employees involved with the mixing operation Describe the records that show how the product was mixed Describe the type and level of supervision of the employees during mixing Describe the handling of prohibited material [how it is identified, how it is stored] Is the firm aware of the rule? Does the firm understand the rule? Describe the training employees receive at the firm Describe the equipment, especially the complexity of operating and/or cleaning, including equipment design flaws If the firm uses flushing for clean-out, describe the flush material, the volume, how the firm validates the amount and type of flush material, and how and when do they check the completion and adequacy of the flush Describe how flush material is subsequently utilized or disposed of PROGRAM  DATE OF ISSUANCE: 10/21/2003 FORM FDA 2438  Page   FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION COMPLIANCE PROGRAM GUIDANCE MANUAL 7371.009 PROGRAM  Violations of 21 CFR  589.2000 may result in adulteration charges under Sections 402(a)(2)(C) and 402(a)(4) of the Act and misbranding charges under Section 403(a)(1) of the Act. For adulteration charges, it is easier to bring a case under the legal standard of Section 402(a)(2)(C) of the Act than under the standard of Section 402(a)(4) of the Act because in the food additive context the ingredient is legally presumed to be unsafe. Therefore, the investigator's priority should be on establishing a violation of Section 402(a)(2)(C) alone or in combination with a violation of Section 403(a)(1).  DATE OF ISSUANCE: 10/21/2003 FORM FDA 2438  Page   FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION COMPLIANCE PROGRAM GUIDANCE MANUAL 7371.009 (1) When Ruminant Feed is Involved The investigator may establish the following violations alone or in combination: (a) Adulteration under 402(a)(2)(C): The highest priority for an enforcement action would be those firms/individuals that are producing feed for ruminant animals containing prohibited material either in a facility producing only ruminant feed, or in a facility producing ruminant and non-ruminant feed with inadequate controls in place. The presence of the prohibited material in the ruminant feed needs to be demonstrated and supported through direct observation by the investigator, admissions by firm's employees and managers, and/or records of receipt and use of the material and inadequate handling at the production facility. The following inspectional observations could be used to support this enforcement action: I. Evidence that prohibited material is being used frequently or regularly as an ingredient in ruminant feed or feed supplements. Note how often this occurs. This evidence can be developed through (a) observations of the investigator; (b) admissions by firm's management/employees; and/or (c) records of ingredient receipt and use in feed. Records can include documents such as invoices, receiving tickets, weight tickets, purchase orders, batch production records, and mixing records. In addition, analytical reports from feed microscopy demonstrating the presence of mammalian tissue can be added information for support of the presence of prohibited material. [CAUTION: Since the analytical reports are supportive, the analytical reports should be accompanied by other supporting information that demonstrate the presence of prohibited material in order to support a 402(a)(2)(C) violation.] PROGRAM  DATE OF ISSUANCE: 10/21/2003 FORM FDA 2438  Page   FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION COMPLIANCE PROGRAM GUIDANCE MANUAL 7371.009 (b) Adulteration under 402(a)(4): If the facility is producing both ruminant and non-ruminant feed, the following inspectional observations could be used to support this enforcement action I.

The presence of the prohibited material in the feed ingredient needs to be demonstrated and supported through direct observation by the investigator, admissions by firm's employees and managers, and/or records of receipt and use of the material and inadequate handling at the production facility. Additionally, you will need to establish the likelihood that the feed ingredient will be used in ruminant feed. That could be established through label claims or reviewing the firm's customer base. The following inspectional observations could be used to support this enforcement action: I. Labeling lacks the required caution statement ""Do Not Feed To Cattle or Other Ruminants."" AND II. Evidence that prohibited material is being used frequently or regularly as a component of the feed ingredient. This evidence can be developed through (a) observations of the investigator; (b) admissions by firm's management/employees; and/or (c) records of ingredient receipt and use in feed. Records can include documents such as invoices, receiving tickets, weight tickets, purchase orders, batch production records, and mixing records. In addition, analytical reports from feed microscopy demonstrating the presence of mammalian tissue can be added information for support of the presence of prohibited material.

Recalls  When violations are encountered investigators should determine the firm's intentions concerning the recall of any and all adulterated and/or misbranded products that have entered commercial distribution. Give the firm an opportunity to voluntarily recall all violative feeds and feed ingredients, and dispose of the products appropriately. If the firm voluntarily recalls, follow the standard procedures in Chapter 7, Regulatory Procedures Manual. If the firm refuses to voluntarily recall, or the recall is ineffective, request State assistance with State actions such as embargo or stop sales and initiate an FDA-requested recall, with FDA press release. Coordinate any recall activity with State counterparts, including the possible sharing of recall audit check responsibilities. Make sure all States and Districts that are affected, or are potentially affected, are notified of the recall. The following information is intended to be used to accommodate three ""generic"" scenarios which to date have represented the majority of situations that FDA has confronted when dealing with the use, distribution and labeling of animal feed products containing prohibited materials. The purpose of this information is to provide guidance to assure similar recall situations will be handled in a consistent manner, and to reduce the burden on FDA of having to re-evaluate situations that present the same variables. This document is not intended to cover all situations  and any new or novel scenarios will require review and evaluation by CVM. Note: Due to the potential seriousness of these scenarios, they should be managed as Class I recalls requiring adequate press to alert consumers of the risks associated with these products.

Prohibited material from domestic or from an imported source is used as an ingredient in feed, or as feed to ruminants. U.S. manufacturer of non-ruminant animal feeds uses prohibited material from a domestic source, or from an imported source, and that feed is fed to ruminants either as a supplement (i.e., dairy cow supplement), by mistake, or unknowingly due to inadequate flushing/cleaning of equipment. (1) Classification: Class II (2) Reason: The ruminant feed or feed ingredient contains prohibited material, with or without a caution statement. (3) Action:   Production/Distribution: Pending results of the investigation. Publicity: Press should be issued immediately by the responsible firm and/or FDA in accordance with established policy for Class I recalls. Publication in the FDA Enforcement Report once the recall action has been classified. Recall: Pursue voluntary recall to the retail level by the responsible firm, or seek FDA requested recall. Depth: Retail level Notification: 100% Effectiveness Checks: Level A, 100% verification of notification and appropriate response Audit Checks: Level B (25%) to direct consignees (distributors/retailers). Level B (25%) to retail accounts of audited distributors Inspection: GMP inspection is indicated to review production controls, scope of possible adulteration, extent of time such practices have been ongoing, and to obtain necessary recall information State Involvement: Advise State counterparts of the situation and enlist their assistance in monitoring. Animal Control: Assess control over the disposition of ruminant animals fed the prohibited protein so as to prevent their slaughter for human food or other animal feed. Coordination with States and USDA/FSIS should be considered. Consult with CVM regarding coordination and regulatory approach of animal disposition. Disposition of recalled /held product: Oversee appropriate disposition of feed and status of animals that have been fed the feed. Determine if relabeling feed with the warning label is an option Page    -  DATE OF ISSUANCE: 10/21/2003 FORM FDA 2438   FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION COMPLIANCE PROGRAM GUIDANCE MANUAL 7371.009 4. Refusals Records of the interstate movement of food and the holding thereof during and after such movement must be made available for inspection and copying under Sections 703 and/or 704 of the Act. Should the firm refuse access to or copying of such records, Districts should contact the FDA/Office of Enforcement (OE) to determine whether it would be appropriate to obtain an inspection warrant under Section 704. If, however, FDA relies on under Section 703 to inspect the records, the agency may not use the records or any evidence derived from the records in a criminal prosecution of the person from whom the records were obtained. The investigator should first make a verbal request for the records. If this request is refused, recommend to OE that an administrative inspection warrant be obtained to gain access to the required records (See Chapter 6, Regulatory Procedures Manual (RPM)) for instructions on recommending inspection warrants).

(a) Definitions-- (1) Protein derived from mammalian tissues means any protein-containing portion of mammalian animals, excluding: Blood and blood products; gelatin; inspected meat products which have been cooked and offered for human food and further heat processed for feed (such as plate waste and used cellulosic food casings); milk products (milk and milk proteins); and any product whose only mammalian protein consists entirely of porcine or equine protein. (2) Renderer means any firm or individual that processes slaughter byproducts, animals unfit for human consumption, or meat scraps. The term includes persons who collect such materials and subject them to minimal processing, or distribute them to firms other than renderers (as defined here) whose intended use for the products may include animal feed. The term includes renderers that also blend animal protein products. (3) Blender means any firm or individual which obtains processed animal protein from more than one source or from more than one species, and subsequently mixes (blends) or redistributes an animal protein product. (4) Feed manufacturer includes manufacturers of complete and intermediate feeds DATE OF ISSUANCE: 10/21/2003 FORM FDA 2438 Page  PROGRAM   FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION COMPLIANCE PROGRAM GUIDANCE MANUAL 7371.009 PROGRAM  intended for animals, and includes on-farm in addition to off-farm feed manufacturing and mixing operations. (5) Nonmammalian protein includes proteins from nonmammalian animals. (6) Distributor includes persons who distribute or transport feeds or feed ingredients intended for animals. (7) Ruminant includes any member of the order of animals which has a stomach with four chambers (rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum) through which feed passes in digestion. The order includes, but is not limited to, cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, deer, elk, and antelopes. (b) Food additive status. The Food and Drug Administration has determined that protein derived from mammalian tissues for use in ruminant feed is a food additive subject to section 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act). The use or intended use in ruminant feed of any material that contains protein derived from mammalian tissues causes the feed to be adulterated and in violation of the act, unless it is the subject of an effective notice of claimed investigational exemption for a food additive under Sec. 570.17 of this chapter. (c) Requirements for renderers that are not included in paragraph (e) of this section. (1) Renderers that manufacture products that contain or may contain protein derived from mammalian tissues and that are intended for use in animal feed shall take the following measures to ensure that materials identified in paragraph (b) of this section are not used in the feed of ruminants: (i) Label the materials as follows: ""Do not feed to cattle or other ruminants""; and (ii) Maintain records sufficient to track the materials throughout their receipt, processing, and distribution, and make the copies available for inspection and copying by the Food and Drug Administration. (2) Renderers described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section will be exempted from the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of this section if they: (i) Use exclusively a manufacturing method that has been validated by the Food and Drug Administration to deactivate the agent that causes transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) and whose design has been made available to the public; (ii) Use routinely a test method that has been validated by the Food and Drug Administration to detect the presence of the agent that causes TSE's and whose design has been made available to the public. Renderers whose products test positive for agents that cause TSE's must comply with paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of this section. Records of the test results shall be made available for inspection by the Food and Drug Administration; or (iii) Use exclusively a method for controlling the manufacturing process that minimizes the risk of the TSE agent entering the product and whose design has been made available to the public and validated by the Food and Drug DATE OF ISSUANCE: 10/21/2003 FORM FDA 2438 Page   FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION COMPLIANCE PROGRAM GUIDANCE MANUAL 7371.009 PROGRAM  Administration. (3) Renderers described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section will be exempted from the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section if they use a permanent method, approved by FDA, to make a mark indicating that the product contains or may contain protein derived from mammalian tissue. If the marking is by the use of an agent that cannot be detected on visual inspection, the renderer must use an agent whose presence can be detected by a method that has been validated by the Food and Drug Administration and whose design has been made available to the public. (d) Requirements for protein blenders, feed manufacturers, and distributors that are not included in paragraph (e) of this section. (1) Protein blenders, feed manufacturers, and distributors that manufacture, blend, process, and distribute products that contain or may contain protein derived from mammalian tissues shall comply with paragraph (c)(1) of this section. (2) Protein blenders, feed manufacturers, and distributors, shall be exempt from paragraphs (d)(1) of this section if they: (i) Purchase animal products from renderers that certified compliance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section or purchase such materials from parties that certify that the materials were purchased from renderers that certified compliance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section; or (ii) Comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section where appropriate. (3) Protein blenders, feed manufacturers, and distributors, shall be exempt from paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section if they: A. Purchase animal protein products that are marked in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section or purchase such materials from renderers that certified compliance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section, or purchase such materials from parties that certify that the materials were purchased from renderers that certified compliance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section; or B. Comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section where appropriate. (4) Pet food products that are sold or are intended for sale at retail and feeds for nonruminant laboratory animals are exempt from the labeling requirements in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. However, if the pet food products or feeds for nonruminant laboratory animals are sold or are intended for sale as distressed or salvage items, then such products shall be labeled in accordance with paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, as appropriate. (5) Copies of certifications as described in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section, shall be made available for inspection and copying by the Food and Drug Administration. (e) Requirements for persons that intend to separate mammalian and nonmammalian materials.

Principle Feeds containing animal tissues and mineral when suspended in CHCl3 (chloroform) readily separate into 2 fractions. The organic fraction floats and contains blood, muscle fibers, connective tissues, organ tissues, feathers, hoof and horn particles, fines thereof, all vegetative tissues from plants, and microbial residues. The minerals and mineralized materials sink. These include bones, teeth, exoskeleton, fish scales, and glass, sand and other mineral materials. 2. Preparation of Sample Place approximately 4 g of ground (mortar and pestle) sample that passes a 16-mesh sieve into a 1 ounce polypropylene medicine cup. Place approximately 1-2 g in a 100mm Petri dish labeled ""untreated"" and examine stereoscopically for animal tissues, as per sections C and D, below. If no animal tissues are detected in the untreated portion, continue on the remaining approximately 2 g sieved sample as follows, in a fume hood. Pour sufficient clean chloroform (about 15 ml) over the sample to form a distinct separation line between the floating material and the heavy mineral particles at the bottom. Stir for about 20 seconds. Squeeze the cup to conform to the shape of the 1/4 teaspoon rectangular measuring spoon (any rectangular shaped stainless steel 1/4 teaspoon). Immediately lift (or assist to decant) the floating organic fraction into a plastic funnel with a folded and trimmed coffee filter (or any hard surface, thin, rapid filter paper) set into a collection bottle. Gently pour the excess chloroform from the sample cup leaving the minerals at the lowest point of the bottom. Rinse the mineral fraction with two small washes of CHCl3. Drain excess solvent from the mineral fraction and set in the hood to dry. Remove the filter paper with the organic fraction and place in a 100 mm glass Petri dish or other container not affected by chloroform. Drying can be accelerated on a hot plate set on the lowest heat setting. When the organic fraction is dry, scrape the filter paper gently to remove all the sample but do not remove fibers from the paper. Transfer the organic fraction to a tared 100 mm plastic Petri dish for analysis (alternatively transfer the sample to a weighing paper, weigh and then transfer the sample to a Petri dish for analysis). When the mineral fraction is dry, transfer it to a weighing paper, weigh the fraction and transfer it to a 100 mm plastic Petri dish. Record the weights of the fraction and calculate the percentages of each fraction from the total DATE OF ISSUANCE: 10/21/2003 FORM FDA 2438 Page  PROGRAM   FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION COMPLIANCE PROGRAM GUIDANCE MANUAL 7371.009 sample weight. 3. Identification of Animal Tissues in the floating phase Examine the dried organic fraction stereoscopically for the range of particles present. Isolate and confirm the presence of the following ingredients: hair, blood particles, and horn or hoof particles. Confirm by microchemical tests as appropriate and as described in the manual (1) and/or AOAC (2). 4. Identification of Bone and Mineral Particles in the mineral phase Examine bones stereoscopically for the range of particles present. Take a small aliquot, prepare a slide in mounting media and examine at 100X with a compound microscope. Use the lacunae and internal structures to confirm the identity of the bone, i.e., mammalian, avian, or marine. Confirm by microchemical tests as appropriate and as described in the Manual (1) and/or AOAC (2).

Personal protective equipment (PPE) recommended for personnel collecting feed samples:     Respiratory protection : minimum half-mask air-purifying respirator (face-sealing) with P100 filters (HEPA) Ocular (eye) mucous membrane protection: goggles Percutaneous (through skin openings such as cuts, abrasions- unbroken skin poses no known hazard)  waterproof gloves on hands; cover skin lesions, cuts, abrasions with waterproof dressing Clothing contamination  disposable coveralls PROGRAM  2. Collection and bagging procedures: Minimize dust as much as possible when collecting 16  1 oz subs and combining them into one sample. Wipe the outside of whirl-pak bag with a water-dampened paper towel in a clean area, and place this bag into another whirl-pak bag (double bag the sample). 3. Cleanup and PPE removal: When in a dust-free area, remove the disposable coveralls by turning inside-out, rolling up and placing in a plastic bag for disposal. Wipe shoes with water dampened paper towel. Remove goggles and respirator; wipe outside of goggles and respirator with water-dampened paper towel. Place goggles and respirator in clean carrying bag. Place all wipes in the disposal bag with the disposable coveralls. Place the bag in a trash receptacle. Safety Information  Laboratory Sample Processing and Analysis 1. Sample custodian Should ensure that the paper sample bag is puncture-free indicating that the whirl pak sample bags remain sealed. If the bag is not intact contact the feed analysts for decontamination procedures. 2. Sample Preparation and Analysis (see next section for decontamination) DATE OF ISSUANCE: 10/21/2003 FORM FDA 2438 Page   FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION COMPLIANCE PROGRAM GUIDANCE MANUAL 7371.009           PROGRAM  Personal protective equipment: laboratory safety glasses, water impervious gloves such as latex when not working with organic solvents, viton gloves when working with chloroform, lab coats. Review the MSDS for chloroform, which is a suspect carcinogen and teratogen. Use chloroform only in the fume hood and wear viton gloves when working with this solvent. Place signage on the door to indicate biohazard work is being performed in your area. Discourage other lab occupants from walking near your area when you are working at the fume hood or at your stereoscope or microscope. Use disposable equipment whenever possible to avoid decontamination issues. Sample bags should be opened in a fume hood on a waterproof disposable liner. Wipe the outside of the whirl pak sample bag with 5.25% hypochlorite solution (undiluted bleach). Perform all sample preparation in the fume hood. When grinding samples with the mortar and pestle, cover the mortar with plastic wrap loosely to prevent any feed particles from leaving the mortar. Gently grind the sample. Place the plastic wrap in a temporary disposal bag until the sample is analyzed. The water layer in the separation step should be saved until the sample analysis is performed. If the sample is found to be violative, use paper towels to absorb the liquid, and place in the red biohazard bag for incineration. Perform a microscopic analysis in a HEPA-filtered cabinet or at a location approved by an ORA/FDA Industrial Hygienist. Other suitable location: slot hood exhaust away from analysts breathing zone.  3. Decontamination (Violative Samples)  The disposable equipment and materials (implements, paper, petrie dishes, slides, etc.) used during the procedure should be placed in a red biohazard bag for incineration. This bag should be sealed when not being filled. Once filled, it should be placed in a secure location for collection by a biohazard/medical waste disposal company (for example: Stericyle : 800-355-8773) which will send it for incineration. Paperwork showing collection and disposal information should be kept on file. All non-disposable equipment and surfaces (unprotected lab bench tops, mortar and pestle, metal sieves, test tubes, metal spatulas) which have come into contact with a violative feed sample must be decontaminated by one of the following methods: 1) Soak equipment for 30 minutes with 5.25% hypochlorite (full strength commercial bleach) for 30 minutes. Rinse well with water. The bleach solution is sink disposable. This method is preferred since it does not generate a hazardous waste. 2) Soak equipment for 30 minutes with 1.0 N NaOH. Dispose of solution in chemical hazardous waste container, which is specifically labeled to receive NaOH. Rinse equipment well with water. Place rinse in hazardous waste container or check rinse pH as required by your hazardous waste program to determine if neutralization and/or sink disposal is acceptable. Do not dilute to lower the pH for sink disposal.

(OASIS Charge Code: MFR INSAN) RECOMMENDING OFFICE: CVM, Division of Compliance (HFV-230) REASON FOR ALERT: On December 7, 2000, USDA/APHIS enacted an immediate prohibition on the importation into the United States of all meat and bone meal (MBM), meat meal, bone meal, blood meal, tankage, offal, or any product containing such, which originated directly from Europe or was rendered/processed in European plants processing animal materials, regardless of species of origin, including poultry and fish meal. This prohibition was deemed necessary by APHIS because of the possibility of cross contamination with the BSE agent. BSE is the bovine form of (Transmissible Spongiform feeding of infected material no test for the presence of between the bovine TSE, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease). a group of uniformly fatal neurological diseases known as TSEs Encephalopathies). BSE appears to be spread in part through to cattle. At this time, the causative agent is unknown and there is the agent in animal derived products. There appears to be a link BSE, and a human form of TSE known as vCJD (new variant  The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Veterinary Services (VS) regulates the importation of animals and animalderived materials to ensure that exotic animal diseases, such as BSE, are not introduced into United States animal populations. More specifically, under 9 CFR 95.4, the USDA does not allow the importation of animal feeds or feed ingredients that contain or consist of processed animal protein (e.g. meat and bone meal) and other animal waste and by product materials that have been derived from animals that have been in specified BSE-affected and BSE-at-risk countries. The USDA may, however, allow for the importation of specific non-ruminant animalderived products, provided the product is the subject of a valid USDA import permit (VS Form 16-6). GUIDANCE: Districts may detain without physical examination shipments of animal feeds (including pet food), animal feed ingredients, and other products for animal use consisting of, or containing, ingredients of animal origin as listed in Attachment A from the designated countries if the product is not the subject of a valid USDA import permit (VS Form 16-6). OASIS Screening Criteria have been loaded to ensure that entries of products that contain or may contain animal protein or by-products will be selected for review by the entry reviewer. As part of the review process, the entry reviewer should contact the filer/importer, request paper entry documents ***(USDA import permit, VS Form 16-6)),*** and remind the filer/importer of their requirement to hold the shipment intact pending FDA release. Additionally, the entry reviewer should determine the intended use of the product, the ingredients, and the name and address of DATE OF ISSUANCE: 10/21/2003 FORM FDA 2438 Page   FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION COMPLIANCE PROGRAM GUIDANCE MANUAL 7371.009 the ultimate consignee. If the filer/importer does not agree to hold the product intact pending FDA release, contact the local office of US Customs and ask that they detain the product. Products which (from labeling or other documentation) appear to contain animal protein or by-products *** and which are not the subject of a valid USDA import permit (VS Form 16-6)***should either be detained by FDA or recommended to USDA/APHIS for appropriate action. (The location of the APHIS/Plant Protection and Quarantine office can be determined by calling USDA's Veterinary Medical Office at (301) 734-7633). Products detained and refused under the above reference charge may not be reconditioned or converted to non-FDA regulated use. They must be either destroyed or exported. Please note that APHIS has received information that shipments of animal-derived products may be offered for entry under descriptions that may be misleading or appear to not be subject to their prohibition, such as fertilizer, adhesive, supplement, nutritional supplement, additive, feed/food additive.

Source: 43 FR 26218, June 16, 1978, unless otherwise noted. (a) Recall is an effective method of removing or correcting consumer products that are in violation of laws administered by the Food and Drug Administration. Recall is a voluntary action that takes place because manufacturers and distributors carry out their responsibility to protect the public health and well-being from products that present a risk of injury or gross deception or are otherwise defective. This section and Secs. 7.41 through 7.59 recognize the voluntary nature of recall by providing guidance so that responsible firms may effectively discharge their recall responsibilities. These sections also recognize that recall is an alternative to a Food and Drug Administration-initiated court action for removing or correcting violative, distributed products by setting forth specific recall procedures for the Food and Drug Administration to monitor recalls and assess the adequacy of a firm's efforts in recall.

Each year in Michigan maple syrup is the first farm crop to be harvested. When February comes to southern Michigan, the tapping of maple trees for syrup starts. The sugaring season may last into April on the Upper Peninsula. Maple candy, Michigan's most historic treat, dates back to the Native Americans.         2.  Mackinac Island Fudge    Fudge also has a traditional and delicious place in the hearts and mouths of Michiganians. Over a hundred years ago, on Mackinac Island, Murdick's Candy Kitchen started making fudge. Since that time fudge has sprung into a huge industry on that beautiful island, beloved to honeymooners and other romantics in the warmer weather. Now fudge is available year-round all over the state.  See a list of fudge and maple syrup candy makers in Michigan.         3.  Flowers    It's too early to plant any of the bedding/garden plants Michigan grows, but it's just the right time for a flowering potted plant or cut flowers -- all grown in Michigan. Consider the cyclamen, traditionally sold in winter as a florist's plant, most cyclamen will burst into bloom from mid-November to spring. With their heart-shaped leaves and blossoms in a bevy of colors -- red, purple, pink, white -- cyclamen are a perfect Valentine's Day gift. With a little bit of extra care, your loved one's Cyclamen can last well beyond the romantic festivities.  Learn more about all the flowers lovingly grown in Michigan.         4.  Michigan Wine    Michigan wineries produce more than 200,000 cases of wine a year. That makes for a lot of romantic evenings. According to the Wine Market Council, wine is the first choice for beverage for ""special occasions"" by both regular and less regular consumers of wine, and women prefer wine to either candy or flowers. Wines are awash in the colors of love -- white, red and (so fitting for romance) blush.         5.  Romantic Getaways    What better place to enjoy the elixir of love than at a winery that puts their heart and soul into making it for you. The wineries and vineyards of Michigan are nestled in the most scenic areas of the state. Plan a weekend or a day trip touring these lovely sites and discover the diversity of Michigan wines by visiting winery tasting rooms around the state. Check  www.michiganwines.com   -- Michigan's wineries   offer overnight accommodations and fabulous weekend packages.         6.  Music    Whatever your taste in music, Michigan probably has someone to satisfy your yearning -- from Motown to Madonna. For those of tiring of winter and looking forward to the spring and growing season, may we suggest Motown's own Temptations ... ""I've got sunshine on a cloudy day/When it's cold outside I've got the month of May/I guess you'll say/ What can make me feel this way?/My girl, my girl/Talkin' 'bout my girl.""         7.  Cherries    Here's a winning love affair ... chocolate and Michigan cherries magically become delicious chocolate-covered cherries. February is National Cherry Month, and  Michigan grows about 75 percent of the red tart cherries in the nation.  Usually tart cherries aren't sold fresh but are made into an amazing array of products including chocolate-covered cherries, cherry pie filling, dried cherries and cherry juice.         8.  Presidential Romance    Gerald Ford is the only president to come from Michigan. February 17 is President's Day, and romantics may recall Ford's moving tribute to his wife Bette in the early lines of his 1974 inaugural speech: ""I am indebted to no man, and only to one woman -- my dear wife -- as I begin this very difficult job.""         9.  Romantic Meals    Ignore the snow and ice. Stay at home and whip up an absolutely delicious meal made from ingredients from your own state. For a special Valentine's Day menu (and it works well any day) visit  Select Michigan's special Valentine's Day recipes.         10.  Climate   Michigan's climate may not be Hawaii's, but the diverse climate and the unique effects of the Great Lakes create an amazing profusion of agricultural products -- more than 125 of them. When you bite into that delicious chocolate-covered cherry, find a flowering cyclamen delivered to you at the doorstep, or open a chilled bottle of Michigan wine ... you'll be glad you're here. Besides that, the state's blustery February cold makes for good snuggling weather.

GX254-22-13685957	"June 2002, Volume 4, No. 2  Dietary Supplements Sold for Weight Loss and Increased Energy Can Be Dangerous By Julie Mortimore, MPH, RD  Illegal substance disguised. Which dietary supplement is currently unregulated despite its chemical similarity to methamphetamine? Ephedrine is a close chemical cousin of the stimulant methamphetamine and has been used to add bulk to cocaine for sale on the street. Many people do not know that the chemical structure of this common ingredient in food supplements closely resembles that of the illegal street drug methamphetamine. What is ephedra (or ephedrine)? Ephedrine is an alkaloid that can be obtained from the stems and aerial portions of various plant species of ephedra. This drug acts as a stimulant of neurotransmitters, which are chemicals that facilitate the passage of impulses between the nerve cells in the brain. This drug has a similar function of other stimulant drugs, such as methamphetamine, yet because ephedrine is derived from an herb, commonly called Ma Huang, it is regulated under the Dietary Supplements Health Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994. Under DSHEA, manufacturers of dietary supplements do not have to prove that their product is safe or effective before it reaches consumers. Ancient Uses. Proponents of ephedra, or Ma Huang, like to boast that the herb has been used in Chinese herbal medicine since 2000 BC. While this is true, what they fail to mention is that the Chinese were very cautious when they used this as an herbal medication. The Chinese discourage its use as a diet aid or in conjunction with natural caffeine sources. And, they do not recommend its use for long periods of time. Much to the misfortune of wary consumers today, the suggested use is often for weight loss or to boost energy, and it is often combined with multiple herb ingredients that contain caffeine. Side effects. Since this herb acts as a stimulant on the central nervous system it increases heart rate and blood pressure. The effects of ephedrine range from significant continued on page 5  Inside This Issue Low Carbohydrate Diets ......... Page 2 trEAT Yourself to Healthier Dining ...................... Page 3   June 2002  Low Carbohydrate Diets By Ellen Coleman, MS, MPH, RD  The shared theme of many popular weight-loss books (Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution, Protein Power, Carbohydrate Addict's Lifespan Program, Sugar Busters, and Enter the Zone) is that carbohydrates cause obesity. These diet books claim that carbohydrates are bad because they raise the blood sugar level and cause the release of insulin--a supposed ""monster"" hormone that promotes fat storage. Dr. Atkins' low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diet was first published in 1972 and recycled 20 years later in 1992 as Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution (M. Evans and Company). Robert Atkins, MD, asserts that obesity exists primarily because of metabolic reasons and that restricting carbohydrate can circumvent this metabolic defect. According to Atkins, individuals can lose more weight by eating a high fat diet than with an equivalent energy intake from a high carbohydrate diet. Atkins recommends no more than 20 grams of carbohydrate per day during the induction phase (two weeks) and recommends daily urine tests to verify the maintenance of the ketosis. He strongly emphasizes high fat foods and avoidance of fruits, vegetables, breads, cereals, and most dairy products.  The Protein Power diet closely resembles the Atkins diet in nutrient composition. The Eades say that it's fine to eat steak, pork ribs, and other fatty meats as long as people don't load up on starch and sugar at the same time. All that saturated fat is a recipe for clogged arteries. The authors outline methods to determine the amount of protein to consume and give instructions for planning meals that focus on protein. Carbohydrates are limited to 30 grams or less per day. The diet permits limited amounts of fruit and vegetables. The authors of Carbohydrate Addict's Lifespan Program, Richard and Rachael Heller, claim that an excess of insulin (""hunger hormone"") causes the ""carbohydrate addict"" to experience intense and recurrent cravings and a heightened ability to store fat. The book claims that carbohydrates crank up insulin production, increase appetite, promote fat storage, and cause weight gain.  SUGAR BUSTERS The authors of Sugar Busters! (Ballantine Publishing Group; 1998) H. Leighton Steward, Morrison Bethea, MD, Sam Andrews, MD, and Luis Balart, MD, claim that sugar is toxic. The premise of the book is that insulin insensitivity causes obesity and non-insulin dependent diabetes. The Sugar Busters diet focuses on reducing high glycemic carbohydrates (insulin-stimulating carbohydrates) to lower insulin levels and decrease insulin resistance. The authors recommend that beverages be consumed in small portions during meals. They claim that ""washing"" food down leads to inadequate chewing and that excess fluid dilutes digestive juices, resulting in partially digested food. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that consuming fluids during a meal negatively affects digestion.  CARBOHYDRATE ADDICT'S The Carbohydrate Addict's ""Basic Plan"" has three essential guidelines: 1) eat a balanced Reward meal every day (one-third craving reducing protein, onethird craving reducing vegetables, one-third carbohydrate rich food; preceded by two cups salad), 2) complete Reward meal within one hour, and 3) eat only craving reducing foods at all other meals and snacks. Following these rules permanently is unlikely for even the most dedicated dieter and takes the pleasure out of eating by treating food as a medical prescription. Furthermore, research does not support the notion of biological ""carbohydrate addiction.""  THE ZONE The Zone is defined as the seemingly effortless, euphoric state where body and mind work at peak efficiency. While in the Zone, people can achieve permanent weight loss and optimum health. The author of Enter the Zone (Harper-Collins, 1997) and Mastering the Zone (Harper-Collins, 1997) Barry Sears, PhD, attributes these benefits to altering the production of eicosanoids with the Zone diet. The major theme of the book is relatively simple-carbohydrates are bad continued on page 3  PROTEIN POWER The authors of Protein Power (Bantam Books, 1996), Michael Eades, MD, and Mary Eades, MD, target insulin as the cause of obesity. The Eades believe that high levels of insulin cause metabolic disturbances in the body leading to hypertension, elevated serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels, diabetes, and obesity. They suggest that restricting carbohydrate overcomes these metabolic disturbances and alleviates medical problems.  Nutrition Times - Page 2   June 2002  Low Carbohydrate Diets continued from page 2  because they raise the blood glucose level and cause the release of insulin, resulting in obesity. Sears further claims that a carbohydrate-rich diet increases disease-promoting ""bad"" eicosanoids, while a Zone-favorable diet increases health--promoting ""good"" eicosanoids. To enter the Zone, food should be treated as a drug--it must be eaten in a controlled fashion and in the proper proportions. Specifically, this means eating exactly 40% of calories as carbohydrate, 30% as protein, and 30% as fat at each meal and snack. The Zone diet focuses on lean meats and can include three servings of fowl per day but restricts high fat animal products, high glycemic grain products (grains, breads, pasta and rice), starchy vegetables, and some fruits. There is no evidence that the 40-30-30 macronutrient composition of the Zone diet has an effect on body weight independently of the energy content of the diet. There is also no proof that carbohydrate makes ""bad"" eicosanoids or that the Zone diet makes ""good"" eicosanoids. An effective weight reduction program includes a nutritionally adequate, reduced energy intake as well as an increase in physical activity. The loss of body fat is proportional to the energy deficit--no specific distribution of dietary protein,  carbohydrate, and fat has been shown to promote more rapid weight loss than other distributions. When energy expenditure exceeds energy intake, weight loss will occur regardless of the macronutrient composition of the diet. Carbohydrates and insulin don't cause obesity and insulin is not a ""monster"" hormone. What matters for weight loss is not carbohydrates and insulin, but calories. Body weight depends on calorie balance--how many calories are consumed compared to how many are expended. Eating a high percentage of calories from carbohydrate does not promote fat storage--a person must eat too many calories relative to energy needs. For some people, a very high carbohydrate diet can raise insulin levels, and high insulin levels increase the risk of heart disease. However, there is no good evidence that high insulin levels make people fat. There's nothing magical about these high protein, low carbohydrate--regimensthey're just low-calorie diets. People lose weight on these diets because of the caloric restriction--not because of what is supposedly happening to their insulin levels. For example, although Enter the Zone says ""don't focus on calories,"" the Zone diet provides only 800 to 1200 kcal a day for the average person.  Although the books claim to make people thinner, they actually make long term compliance difficult and take the fun out of eating. Most professional health groups in the country recommend 55 to 60% calories as carbohydrate, 10-15% as protein, and 30% or less as fat. Weight loss eating plans should meet the criteria for a ""healthy diet,"" as defined by the 2000 Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the 2000 American Heart Association Dietary Guidelines. The low carbohydrate diets advocated by these books fail because they are too high in total fat and saturated fat (except for the Sugar Busters and Zone diets) and don't supply adequate dietary carbohydrate, vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Such diets are also contrary to the scientific evidence that consuming a diet rich in plant foods such as whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and beans helps to prevent many chronic diseases, including coronary heart disease and cancer. Nutrition recommendations should be supported by scientific research that is double-blind, placebo-controlled, and published in peer-reviewed journals. These diet books, however, abound with unproven claims based on case histories, testimonials, and unpublished studies.  trEAT Yourself to Healthier Dining By Susan Goldstein, co-author and regional director of Healthy Dining  ""If you don't smoke, what you eat may be the biggest factor influencing your health"" (U.S. Surgeon General). This is a startling announcement! Especially since Americans eat out 45 times a week and spend 48% of food dollars away from home (increasing to an estimated 53% in 2010). As we continue to dine out more often for business, pleasure, and convenience, making healthy choices in restaurants is absolutely essential to our health and well-being. In Orange County, there is exciting news...many popular restaurants are meeting today's growing desire for healthier eating  with dishes that taste sensational. Over the past decade, Healthy Dining has teamed up with hundreds of restaurants to analyze their items for nutrition content (calories, fat, cholesterol, sodium, protein, carbohydrates, and food exchanges) and guide consumers to these selections, featured in the Healthy Dining in Orange County book. More and more chefs are rising to the challenge of creating meals with our health and taste buds in mind. continued on page 4  Nutrition Times - Page 3   June 2002  trEAT Yourself to Healthier Dining continued from page 3  How? Menu items are expertly prepared with little or no butter, cream or salt. Fresh and seasonal ingredients are combined with bold seasonings and spices. Fruits and vegetables take ""center stage"" on the plate, or as main ingredients in sauces, stocks and purees. For side dishes, instead of the typical french fries or onion rings, whole grains and fresh produce burst with color, taste, and texture. You can find many terrific choices like these in the Healthy Dining in Orange County book, such as: ""Lite Chicken with Garlic and Snow Peas"" at Chin Chin in Mission Viejo (opening soon in Tustin). Velveted pieces of chicken breast tossed with snow peas, fresh mushrooms, carrots, and sliced garlic. 520 calories, 12 grams fat, 150 mg cholesterol, 61 grams protein. ""Branzino In Guazetto"" at Antonello Ristorante in Santa Ana. Sea bass cooked in tomatoes, oregano, and white wine. 465 calories, 19 grams fat, 95 mg cholesterol, 46 grams protein. ""Organic Mexican Corn Chowder"" at The Health Emporium Market & Grille in Corona del Mar. One of many popular soups, freshly prepared on the premises using all organic ingredients. 325 calories, 3 grams fat, 0 mg cholesterol, 10 grams protein. With Healthy Dining, it's a whole new world of delicious dining and optimal health! Here are seven simple steps you can take this summer...and all year 'round...to trEAT yourself to healthier dining: 1. Look over the menu and when it's time to order, ask questions. Find out exactly what comes with the meal and ask for substitutions. A broiled filet of sole turns into a diet disaster when accompanied by creamy coleslaw and french fries. Ask for alternatives like fresh fruit, garden salad, or steamed veggies. 2. Select dishes that require little or no added fat, such as broiled, baked, or steamed. Many entrees may contain hidden butter, oil, or salt, so it's important to request that little or none be added. Also ask or look for an explanation of items labeled as healthy, natural, low-fat, etc. In general, these words have no standardized meaning on menus. 3. Request that sauces, dressings, or toppings be served on the side or in a lower-fat version. Then, use these Nutrition Times - Page 4  sparingly--a light touch can add a surprising amount of flavor. Also learn which ""special requests"" keep the taste in and the extra fat and calories out. The Healthy Dining books highlight many special requests. For example, at California Pizza Kitchen, you can ""special request"" the Broccoli Sundried Tomato Fusilli with ""no oil"" and save 475 calories and 54 grams of fat (corkscrew pasta with fresh broccoli, browned garlic, sundried tomatoes, fresh thyme and Parmesan cheese). 4. During your meal, eat slowly. Relish the atmosphere, the company, the occasion, and by all means the food! Take time to enjoy everything about your meal, expertly prepared and served to give you the best possible dining experience. 5. Consider sharing an entree or taking part home for lunch or dinner the next day. Most restaurant portions are large and getting larger. It's shocking but true...restaurant meals often contain 1000-2000 calories and 50-100 grams of fat. That's more than a full day's allowance of fat, and close to a full day's intake of calories, in just one meal. 6. Take a moment to compliment the server and manager when you're pleased with your visit. Restaurants that honor our health and take active steps to provide satisfying meals need to hear that their efforts are important and appreciated. Restaurants listen to you, the consumer, and they respond. Your voice is powerful...and can help lead the way to healthier cuisine that will dazzle and delight! 7. Finally, experiment at home to re-create healthy restaurant recipes you've enjoyed. (See page 6.)

Adverse reactions reported to the American Association of Poison Control Centers doubled between 1997 and 1999, jumping from 211 to 407. Between 1993 and 2001, there were 81 deaths associated with ephedra use, mostly from stroke. Are you at risk? Although ephedrine has been proven safe and effective in the treatment of bronchial asthma and is found in many over-the-counter cold and allergy medications used as a nasal decongestant, it has not enjoyed the same reliability when used for weight loss or as an energy booster. Dangerous consequences are often dependent on the dose taken. Serious drug-herb interactions can occur when ephedrine is combined with monoamine oxydase (MAO) inhibitors and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. MAOIs (e.g., phenelzine, pargyline, selegiline) are often prescribed for the treatment of depression and mood disorders. Combining MAOIs with ephedrine can give rise to a hypertensive crisis resulting in stroke or myocardial infarction. Another potentially hazardous drug interaction with ephedrine involves the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or NSAIDS (such as aspirin, indomethacin and ibuprofen). Here the two drugs potentiate each other's actions and have been associated with episodes of severe hypertension. Along with users of the previous medications, individuals are at higher risk if they have the following health conditions: heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, thyroid or kidney problems, history of seizures, psychosis, anxiety disorders, or women who are pregnant or lactating.  Studies. In December 2000, the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) examined the adverse cardiovascular and central nervous system events associated with dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids (Haller and Benowitz). Records from 140 case reports of users who experienced complications between 1997 and 1999 were reviewed. The results showed that onethird of the patient complications were definitely or probably caused by ephedra, while another one-third showed that ephedra was the possible cause of such problems. The researchers noted that most of the people studied were healthy, young people, some of whom had been taking ephedra as directed for only a few days. Another recent study (Gurley, 2000) analyzed the amount of ephedra alkaloids in 20 products and found that they contained zero to over 150 percent of the amount of ephedrine listed on the label. What You Can Do. A bill that provides greater consumer protection for ephedrine products, SB 397, has passed the Senate and now awaits approval from the Assembly Appropriation Committee. SB 397 would require full disclosure of content on the label, a warning statement of health conditions and drugs that contraindicate use, and a toll-free number to the FDA MedWatch on each label for consumers to report adverse reactions. It would also prohibit its sale to minors. If you would like to let your state assembly representative know how you feel about this proposal, go to www.leginfo.ca.us for a committee directory. Vigilant reporting by consumers and healthcare professionals of adverse reactions due to the use of dietary supplements is necessary to establish  better consumer protection laws. You can play a vital role in this process simply by reporting your own experiences and directing other injured persons to the FDA MedWatch reporting system, (800) FDA-1088, or go to www.fda.gov/ medwatch. Closing Thoughts. Remember that dietary supplements are sold in the same marketing atmosphere (commonly called caveat emptor or ""let the buyer beware"") as other goods and services, such as cars, appliances, or automotive repair. Don't assume that because these types of products can affect our health that their safety and efficacy is safeguarded. It's not. This is not a reason to forego the use of all dietary supplements. However, it is the reason to develop a ""healthy skepticism"" toward nutrition-related products and services in the marketplace. Bottom line: Steer clear of products that contain ephedra or Ma Huang for weight loss or to boost energy.

Consumers should avoid eating tamarind candy labeled "" Bolirindo "" lollipops and "" Rollito di Tamarindo "" fruit rolls made by Dulmex in Mexico.   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) alerted the public about the lollipops last week after the candies were found in the homes of three young children in California. The children, all age two, had elevated lead levels. According to results of tests conducted in California, the candy, wrappers, and lollipop sticks all contained high levels of lead.   ""Awareness is the key to preventing this type of lead poisoning, ""said State Health Officer Maxine Hayes, M.D./M.P.H. ""We want to protect children under age six who suffer the most serious health effects from exposure to lead.""   The Health Department lead program is working with the FDA and local health departments to learn how widespread the products have been distributed in Washington state. The products are common in the Yakima Valley, according to Barbara Andrews of the Yakima Health District. ""Our staff found the lollipops or fruit rolls in many of the stores they visited,"" said Andrews.   The lollipop is a soft, dark brown tamarind fruit candy lollipop on a white or orange stick. It is wrapped in an orange-red wrapper with ""BOLIRINDO"" in white lettering, and a picture of a brown tamarind fruit. The fruit roll is a cigar-shaped roll with a similar wrapper.   The Department of Health is currently gathering samples of these and other Mexican tamarind candy products to be tested at the state Public Health Laboratory. Preliminary findings from California indicate these products pose a serious health threat because they contain dangerously high levels of lead.   ""Lead can cause damage to the brain and nervous system, especially in young children, infants, and pregnant women,"" said Marcia Mueller, program manager for the state Lead Surveillance Program. ""Handling or eating these products could expose children to dangerously high levels of lead causing problems that could last a lifetime.""   ""Children with lead poisoning typically do not look or act sick,"" said Mueller. ""Parents should keep these candies out of children’s hands and not let them eat it. If parents suspect that their child has handled or eaten this candy, consult your family doctor about a simple blood lead test.""   These Dulmex brand tamarind candy products are commonly repackaged under the brand names ""Casa de Dulce,"" ""Juanita’s,"" ""Mojave,"" and ""Payoso.""

As a result, the state Department of Health (DOH) is extending a health warning to include all Dulmex candies. The candies and their wrappers may contain dangerously high levels of lead. The source of the lead appears to be the orange ink used on the candy wrappers. The candies include  coconut rolls ,  tamarind rolls , and  tamarind lollipops . The rolls may be packaged under the brand names “Casa de Dulce,” “Juanita’s,” “Payaso,” or “Mojave.” The lollipops are commonly packaged under the name “Bolirindo.”   The department issued a health warning last week regarding the tamarind candies made by Dulmex. Tests ordered by the department revealed that the coconut rolls are potentially contaminated with lead, too. The wrappers on all three products contained very high levels of lead. Lead levels in the tamarind candy tested by DOH exceeded the FDA standard for lead in tamarind.   “All Dulmex candies should be considered potentially dangerous and should not be eaten,” said Marcia Mueller, program manager for the state Lead Surveillance Program. “Lead can damage the brain and the nervous system, especially in children under six years old. Parents who think their children may have eaten any of these candies should ask their family doctor about a simple blood test.”   These candies are widely sold in Washington state. Staffers from state and local health offices have found them in both western and eastern Washington, and in both major chain groceries and in small groceries specializing in Mexican products. Dulmex products are often repackaged under other brand names.       ###       HOME      Privacy Notice  Copyright © 2001  Washington State Department of Health    Last Update :  November 18, 2003 01:16 PM  Comments or questions regarding this web site?

The candies are packaged in small sealed    plastic cups. Each mini jelly cup is about the size of a single-serve coffee    creamer.     These candies, which contain the ingredient ""konjac,"" are being recalled because    the FDA and the Consumer Product Safety Commission staff consider this type    of candy to pose a serious choking risk, particularly to infants, children and    the elderly. Unlike gelatin products commonly found in the United States, these    candies do not readily dissolve when placed in the mouth and their size and    other characteristics make them a serious choking hazard. Local authorities    in the United States have reported six children's deaths from choking associated    with this type of jelly candy. There have also been reports of deaths in other    countries.     The first recall is by Golden Country Oriental Food,  Chicago, Illinois. These candies were distributed in Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Wisconsin, Florida, Michigan,  Missouri, South Dakota, and Kansas.  The three brand names  include “Don-Empire”; another with no brand name and only  Chinese characters and butterflies on the label; and ""My Love  and Coco.”     The 16.5-17 gram individual serving cups are packaged in  300-gram plastic bags with 30 bags per case, 510 gram plastic  panda bear shaped jars with 12 jars per case, and 1200 gram  round plastic jars with 6 jars per case. Golden Country Oriental  Food has requested a recall through its distributors and  retailers to consumers, who are urged to return this product to  the place of purchase.

Consumers are urged to return this product to the place of  purchase. Consumers with questions may contact the company at  773-927-0100.    In August and October 2001, the FDA issued general warnings against consuming    mini-cup gel candies that contain the ingredient ""konjac."" Numerous other firms    have recalled these gel candies. In October 2001, the agency issued an  Import    Alert  to prevent these kinds of candies from entering the country. Import    Alerts identify problem commodities and communicate guidance to FDA field offices    and the importing community for detention of products that appear to be in violation    of the law. However, candies imported prior to the import alert are still in    the US market.     These candies are sold under various brand names and are  distributed by various companies.

Consumer Alert: Choking Hazard Posed by Mini-Cup Gel Candies    Containing Konjac     NEWS RELEASE     Contact:  Jessica Chittenden           518-457-3136                     For Immediate Release     Consumer Alert: Choking Hazard Posed by Mini-Cup Gel Candies Containing Konjac     New York - January 10, 2002 -- State Agriculture Commissioner Nathan L. Rudgers    today issued a consumer alert warning consumers of a choking hazard associated    with various brands and flavors of imported mini-cup gel candies that contain    the ingredient Konjac.    The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has asked the Department to assist in    the removal of these candies from store shelves. In December, FDA announced    the recall of candies with the brand names NATA and Mothers Pride. The    candies also have names such as Mini-Cup Jelly Products, New Choice Mini    Fruity Gels, Konjac Coconut Jelly and other similar names. FDA informed the    Department that local authorities in other states have reported several childrens    deaths from choking to be associated with this type of gel candy in the United    States. These candies contain the ingredient Konjac (also called conjac, konnyaku,    yam flour or glucomannan) and are typically packaged in cups as individual,    mouth-sized servings, often featuring an embedded piece of preserved fruit.    Although the contents look like a typical gelatin product, the small gel candies    maintain their product characteristics (i.e. shape, texture, firmness) without    melting when placed in the mouth.    The plastic gel cup is approximately the size of a single-service coffee creamer.    The individual gel cups are packaged in 300 gram plastic bags or 3.3 pound plastic    jars. They may also be offered for sale as individual cups. The gels are sold    in various flavors, including mango, lyechee (lychee), taro and assorted fruit.    The candy bears warning labels suggesting that it not be eaten by children under    age 3 or age 5. These are imported products and many of the bags are printed    in both English and Chinese.    New York Agriculture and Markets Food Safety Inspectors have been actively    looking for these products in retail food and discount stores throughout the    state, and they are seizing and removing them from shelves when found.

Each year in Michigan maple syrup is the first farm crop to be harvested. When February comes to southern Michigan, the tapping of maple trees for syrup starts. The sugaring season may last into April on the Upper Peninsula. Maple candy, Michigan's most historic treat, dates back to the Native Americans.         2.  Mackinac Island Fudge    Fudge also has a traditional and delicious place in the hearts and mouths of Michiganians. Over a hundred years ago, on Mackinac Island, Murdick's Candy Kitchen started making fudge. Since that time fudge has sprung into a huge industry on that beautiful island, beloved to honeymooners and other romantics in the warmer weather. Now fudge is available year-round all over the state.  See a list of fudge and maple syrup candy makers in Michigan.         3.  Flowers    It's too early to plant any of the bedding/garden plants Michigan grows, but it's just the right time for a flowering potted plant or cut flowers -- all grown in Michigan. Consider the cyclamen, traditionally sold in winter as a florist's plant, most cyclamen will burst into bloom from mid-November to spring. With their heart-shaped leaves and blossoms in a bevy of colors -- red, purple, pink, white -- cyclamen are a perfect Valentine's Day gift. With a little bit of extra care, your loved one's Cyclamen can last well beyond the romantic festivities.  Learn more about all the flowers lovingly grown in Michigan.         4.  Michigan Wine    Michigan wineries produce more than 200,000 cases of wine a year. That makes for a lot of romantic evenings. According to the Wine Market Council, wine is the first choice for beverage for ""special occasions"" by both regular and less regular consumers of wine, and women prefer wine to either candy or flowers. Wines are awash in the colors of love -- white, red and (so fitting for romance) blush.         5.  Romantic Getaways    What better place to enjoy the elixir of love than at a winery that puts their heart and soul into making it for you. The wineries and vineyards of Michigan are nestled in the most scenic areas of the state. Plan a weekend or a day trip touring these lovely sites and discover the diversity of Michigan wines by visiting winery tasting rooms around the state. Check  www.michiganwines.com   -- Michigan's wineries   offer overnight accommodations and fabulous weekend packages.         6.  Music    Whatever your taste in music, Michigan probably has someone to satisfy your yearning -- from Motown to Madonna. For those of tiring of winter and looking forward to the spring and growing season, may we suggest Motown's own Temptations ... ""I've got sunshine on a cloudy day/When it's cold outside I've got the month of May/I guess you'll say/ What can make me feel this way?/My girl, my girl/Talkin' 'bout my girl.""         7.  Cherries    Here's a winning love affair ... chocolate and Michigan cherries magically become delicious chocolate-covered cherries. February is National Cherry Month, and  Michigan grows about 75 percent of the red tart cherries in the nation.  Usually tart cherries aren't sold fresh but are made into an amazing array of products including chocolate-covered cherries, cherry pie filling, dried cherries and cherry juice.         8.  Presidential Romance    Gerald Ford is the only president to come from Michigan. February 17 is President's Day, and romantics may recall Ford's moving tribute to his wife Bette in the early lines of his 1974 inaugural speech: ""I am indebted to no man, and only to one woman -- my dear wife -- as I begin this very difficult job.""         9.  Romantic Meals    Ignore the snow and ice. Stay at home and whip up an absolutely delicious meal made from ingredients from your own state. For a special Valentine's Day menu (and it works well any day) visit  Select Michigan's special Valentine's Day recipes.         10.  Climate   Michigan's climate may not be Hawaii's, but the diverse climate and the unique effects of the Great Lakes create an amazing profusion of agricultural products -- more than 125 of them. When you bite into that delicious chocolate-covered cherry, find a flowering cyclamen delivered to you at the doorstep, or open a chilled bottle of Michigan wine ... you'll be glad you're here. Besides that, the state's blustery February cold makes for good snuggling weather.

GX008-89-1465800	"NEWS 12/29/1992   F.B. Washburn Candy Corp, agreeded to recall its Filled Candies because they contain peanut butter that is not declared on the product's label   P92-44                                  Food and Drug Administration FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                   Chris Lecos - (202) 205-4144      The Food and Drug Administration today informed consumers that F. B.       Washburn Candy Corp., Brockton, Mass., has agreed to recall its Waleeco        Dainty Filled Candies because they contain peanut butter that is not           declared on the product's label.  People who are allergic to peanuts run the   risk of serious or life-threatening reactions if they consume the candies.     On Dec. 24, FDA warned people who are allergic to peanuts not to consume   the candies.  Canadian health authorities have issued a similar warning.     The product has no lot or code number.  It is sold in two-pound,           cardboard cylinders bearing the name, ""Waleeco Dainty Filled Candies.""  FDA    has not received any reports of illnesses due to consumption of the candies.     An estimated 53,000 two-pound cylinders of the candies may have been       distributed in this country, primarily in New England and elsewhere on the     eastern seaboard.     The company has notified its distributors in New England, Maryland, New    York and eastern Pennsylvania of the recall.  The distributors are             contacting local retailers to withdraw the product from their shelves.     FDA is one of the eight Public Health Service Agencies in HHS.                                     ###"
GX010-04-4297705	"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE        P02-08        April 11, 2002        Media Inquiries: 301-436-2335               Consumer Inquiries: 888-INFO-FDA                  FDA ANNOUNCES RECALL OF FUJI BRAND KONJAC JELLY CANDY     DUE TO CHOKING HAZARD     The FDA is announcing recalls from Fuwa Trading Co., El Monte, CA and Oriental    Foodbank, Commerce, CA, of 100 cases of mini jelly candies (or mini-cup gel    candy) because these products present a choking hazard. The product is distributed    to retail establishments in California, Nevada and Arizona under the ""Fuji""    brand. Flavors include Mango, Lychee, Soursop and Coconut flavors. The candy    comes in small sealed plastic cups that contain konjac gelatin with or without    a chunk of fruit.   These candies contain the ingredient ""konjac"" (also known as conjac,    konnyaku, yam flour, or glucomannan). The Consumer Product Safety Commission    staff and the Food and Drug Administration consider this type of candy to pose    a serious choking risk, particularly to infants, children and the elderly. The    packaging, shape, slipperiness, and consistency endow the mini-gel products    with a potential to cause choking.   There have been six children's deaths from choking associated with this type    of jelly candy throughout the United States in recent years. There have also    been reports of deaths in other countries.    Each jelly cup is about the size of a single-serve coffee creamer. The jelly    cups are in 10 oz. plastic bags that are contained in cases of 30 bags each.    The candy does not bear any warnings regarding the choking hazard.    Consumers are urged to return this product to the place of purchase for a full    refund. Consumers with questions may contact Oriental Foodbank at 323-838-0922.   In August and October 2001, the FDA issued general warnings against consuming    mini-cup gel candies that contain the ingredient ""konjac."" Other firms    recalled gel candies. In October 2001, the agency issued an Import Alert. Import    Alerts identify problem commodities and communicate guidance to FDA field offices    and the importing community for detention of products that appear to be in violation    of the law. However, candies imported prior to the import alert are still in    the US market.    This type of candy is sold under various brand names and are distributed by    various companies. The FDA continues to investigate this issue.                  ###     Complete      list of Konjac candy recalls              Media    Contacts    |    FDA    News Page    |    FDA    Home Page      Office of    Public Affairs    Web page uploaded by  clb  2002-APR-11."

Wines are awash in the colors of love -- white, red and (so fitting for romance) blush.         5.  Romantic Getaways    What better place to enjoy the elixir of love than at a winery that puts their heart and soul into making it for you. The wineries and vineyards of Michigan are nestled in the most scenic areas of the state. Plan a weekend or a day trip touring these lovely sites and discover the diversity of Michigan wines by visiting winery tasting rooms around the state. Check  www.michiganwines.com   -- Michigan's wineries   offer overnight accommodations and fabulous weekend packages.         6.  Music    Whatever your taste in music, Michigan probably has someone to satisfy your yearning -- from Motown to Madonna. For those of tiring of winter and looking forward to the spring and growing season, may we suggest Motown's own Temptations ... ""I've got sunshine on a cloudy day/When it's cold outside I've got the month of May/I guess you'll say/ What can make me feel this way?/My girl, my girl/Talkin' 'bout my girl.""         7.  Cherries    Here's a winning love affair ... chocolate and Michigan cherries magically become delicious chocolate-covered cherries. February is National Cherry Month, and  Michigan grows about 75 percent of the red tart cherries in the nation.  Usually tart cherries aren't sold fresh but are made into an amazing array of products including chocolate-covered cherries, cherry pie filling, dried cherries and cherry juice.         8.  Presidential Romance    Gerald Ford is the only president to come from Michigan. February 17 is President's Day, and romantics may recall Ford's moving tribute to his wife Bette in the early lines of his 1974 inaugural speech: ""I am indebted to no man, and only to one woman -- my dear wife -- as I begin this very difficult job.""         9.  Romantic Meals    Ignore the snow and ice. Stay at home and whip up an absolutely delicious meal made from ingredients from your own state. For a special Valentine's Day menu (and it works well any day) visit  Select Michigan's special Valentine's Day recipes.         10.  Climate   Michigan's climate may not be Hawaii's, but the diverse climate and the unique effects of the Great Lakes create an amazing profusion of agricultural products -- more than 125 of them. When you bite into that delicious chocolate-covered cherry, find a flowering cyclamen delivered to you at the doorstep, or open a chilled bottle of Michigan wine ... you'll be glad you're here. Besides that, the state's blustery February cold makes for good snuggling weather.

FDA does not endorse either the product or the company.     Consumer Alert: Listeria Warning for Queso Fresco, Fresh Cheese   NEWS RELEASE     Contact:  Jessica Chittenden            (518) 457-3136        For Immediate Release     Consumer Alert: Listeria Warning for Queso Fresco, Fresh Cheese     Brooklyn, NY - April 25, 2003 -- State Agriculture Commissioner Nathan L. Rudgers    today warned consumers not to eat ""Peregrina Cheese, Queso Fresco, Fresh    Cheese,"" made by Peregrina Cheese Corp., because certain packages of this    product tested positive for Listeria contamination.   ""Peregrina Cheese, Queso Fresco, Fresh Cheese"" is sold in 14-ounce    plastic containers, which display a plant number of 36-8431 and a grocery sticker    identifying the code ""1049."" The consumer warning affects all packages    with this code. The product is manufactured by Peregrina Cheese Corp., 342 Ten    Eyck St., Brooklyn, New York 11206. The product was distributed primarily in    the New York City metropolitan area.    The contaminated cheese was discovered through routine sampling and testing    by the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets.    If consumed, the product could cause Listeriosis, a disease that usually causes    mild flu-like symptoms in healthy individuals; however, in immune-compromised    individuals, meningitis and blood poisoning can occur. Pregnant women are also    considered a high-risk group, as Listeriosis can also result in stillbirths.   To date, no known illnesses have been associated with the product.   Consumers with this product are urged to discard it or return it to the place    of purchase.

GX093-90-7109563	"TEKTRAN   CADMIUM ABSORPTION IN HUMAN VOLUNTEERS FED CONFECTIONERY SUNFLOWER KERNELS (HELIANTHUS ANNUUS L.) LABELED WITH A STABLE ISOTOPE OF CADMIUM      Author(s):    VANDERPOOL  RICHARD A              REEVES  PHILIP G                         Interpretive Summary:    The trace element cadmium (Cd) is found in small amounts in most foods.     Instead of being a nutrient, it is most often thought of as a toxin, and    if we eat too much of it, we might develop problems with kidney function.   Some plants like confectionery sunflowers take up Cd from the soil and      deposit it in their seeds. We need to know how much of the Cd we get from   eating sunflower seeds is actually absorbed into the body.  To determine    this, we measured the amount of Cd absorbed from sunflower kernels by       labeling the kernels with a isotopes of Cd and using it as a tracer to      follow the Cd as it was absorbed into the body.  Men and women volunteers   ate a breakfast containing cereal, milk and juice, and a sandwich of bread  and labeled sunflower ""butter"".  For 21 days after eating the sunflower     ""butter"", fecal samples were collected and the amount of Cd label was       measured.  If we know how much labeled Cd the volunteers ate and how much   they excreted in their feces, then we can estimate how much total Cd they   absorbed into their bodies.  We estimated that the women absorbed about     10% of the Cd in the sunflower kernels and men absorbed about 2%.  This     finding shows that Cd in sunflower kernels is absorbed at about the same    rate as from other types of food.  This important information on how the    body absorbed Cd from sunflower kernels can be used to help government      agencies set more accurate guidelines for regulating the amount of Cd in    food.

GX085-23-6482546	TEKTRAN   MINERAL STATUS OF FEMALE RATS AFFETS THE ABSORPTION AND ORGAN DISTRIBUTION OF DIETARY CADMIUM DERIVED FROM CONFECTIONERY SUNFLOWER KERNELS (HELIANTHUS ANNUUS L.)      Author(s):    REEVES  PHILIP G                   CHANEY  RUFUS L                          Interpretive Summary:    Cadmium (Cd) is a trace element found in most foods, and it is most often   thought of as a toxin.  If we eat too much Cd, we might develop kidney      dysfunction.  Most soils naturally contain a small amount of Cd, and some   plants, such as sunflowers, take up the Cd and deposit it in their seeds.   As a result, the kernels contain more Cd than most other grains.  Some      regulatory agencies place restrictions on the amount of Cd allowed in the   kernels, and these restrictions are based primarily on the amount of Cd in  the kernels, and not on whether the Cd can be absorbed into the body from   the ingested kernels.  There are other factors in food, such as iron,       calcium, and zinc, that might inhibit the absorption of Cd.  So, what we    need to know is what effects the other nutrients have on the absorption of  Cd from sunflower kernels.  To determine this, we fed female rats diets     containing 20% sunflower kernels.  The diets also contained a low and a     normal amount of each of calcium, iron, and zinc.  After five weeks, we     measured the amount of Cd absorbed from the sunflower kernels.  The rats    fed low dietary iron or calcium absorbed much more Cd than those fed        normal amounts of these minerals in their diets.  Rats fed low zinc diets   were not different from those that were fed normal zinc.  Cd found in the   small intestine, serum, liver, and kidney was higher when the rats ate      diets with low iron and calcium than when they ate diets with normal        amounts of these minerals.  This research strongly suggests that            regulatory agencies should not only consider the amount of Cd in food but   also the amount of calcium and iron in that food when placing restrictions  on the Cd content.  Normal calcium and iron in the diet with which the Cd   is eaten will lower the amount of Cd absorbed into the body.

GX005-73-15385707	"A New Look for Foods        Scientists finesse new forms of familiar food.     Leftover Thanksgiving turkey has long inspired American ingenuity to  disguise a common food to renew its appeal. The Land-Grant Universities and  USDA are  expanding this tradition to find new ways to present and market  other foods.         Payoff                 A slice of Americana.  Peanut butter now fits in your vest pocket without  the sticky mess. Individually wrapped peanut butter portions, similar to  single slices of American cheese, have been developed by   Oklahoma State  researchers. The technology has been licensed to a small Oklahoma-based food  company. The convenience-sized product, called ""P.B. Slices,"" has been  marketed in the southeastern United States. Sales are expanding nationwide.                     Cleaner burning candle.  Paraffin, a petroleum product, is used to make  nearly all the candles in this country.  Iowa  State  researchers have developed an improved candle wax from hydrogenated soybean oil. The soy candles  burn cleaner and slower, so they last longer. Replacing a quarter of the  soot-producing paraffin used annually for candles in the United States would require  25 million bushels of soybeans and would expand the market for this  renewable resource.                     Chip off the old cowpea.  Chips and pork rinds soon may get some  competition from healthier snack foods based on black-eyed peas and peanuts.  Georgia  food scientists have developed ribbon-shaped snacks from  extruded cowpea and rice. Extrusion cooking makes puffed, crisp snacks that  resemble pork rinds. The snacks have less than half the fat of real pork rinds and  better protein quality. They also are a good source of dietary fiber and provide  10 times as much folate as pork rinds. A newly developed extruded peanut  snack proved acceptable to consumer panels, too.                     Cheesy ideas.  To enhance goat milk's value, marketability and  profitability,  Langston  has been teaching Oklahoma goat producers how to make  quality goat cheese. Producers have credited the cheese with creating a market  for excess goat milk.  Wisconsin   researchers developed techniques for making 50 percent  reduced-fat cheddar cheese that is comparable in flavor to  full-fat cheddar. The techniques for reducing fat  while maintaining flavor and texture can be applied to  any cheese and are being used by commercial cheesemakers.                     Fortified formula.  Omega-3 and omega-6  fatty acids are important in visual and neural  development of infants, revealed  Auburn  researchers.  In February 2002, infant formula containing these essential fatty acids was introduced in the  United States.                     Funky functional foods.  People who eat a  higher percentage of soy-based foods than in  typical Western diets have a lower incidence of  ailments such as cancer and heart disease. Food  companies use soybean oil due to its high nutritional  quality, availability and low price. However, soybean oil  has a major drawback — it produces an  undesirable ""grassy"" flavor. An  Ohio  State  food scientist found that removing chlorophyll during soybean  oil processing prevents the grassy flavor. Major  soybean oil processors adopted the practice and  are producing stable, high-quality soybean oil.   Iowa State  researchers found a single daily dose of  plant sterols, the plant version of cholesterol, added  to lean ground meat lowers blood cholesterol.                       Beefing up profit.  The round is the leanest of  all beef cuts, but is one of the least tender.   South Dakota State  researchers identified some  exceptionally tender portions of beef round, which  could result in $1.65 more per beef carcass or $46  million more to the U.S. beef industry per year. They  also discovered the chuck/rib separation point could  be moved forward to a point between the 4th and  5th rib bones without compromising tenderness or consumer acceptability, but add four more  ribeye steaks to every beef carcass. Moving the point  of separation would yield 2.4 additional pounds of ribeye steaks per carcass, which translates  into $3.55 per head extra for the beef producer.               Muscling in new steaks.  Research by   Nebraska  and  Florida  meat scientists provided the  scientific foundation for new products developed from  the traditionally undervalued beef chuck and  round. Researchers analyzed more than 5,500 muscles  in the chuck and round. They identified higher  value potential in numerous muscles traditionally used  for ground beef or roasts. The beef industry is  using these findings to create higher value products  that offer economical new steaks for  cost-conscious consumers and boost carcass value. The best  known new cut is the flat iron steak, which is showing  up on restaurant menus nationwide and at some meat counters. These new cuts sell for $2.99 to $5.99  per pound compared with roasts and ground beef  that typically bring about $1.19 to $1.99 per pound.                     Healthful muffins and cookies.  Inulin is a  new commercial product that can be substituted for  sugar and fat in processed foods. Inulin, derived  from chicory roots, reduces calories, adds soluble  dietary fiber and is safe for diabetics.   Purdue  researchers found that 1 percent of Inulin can replace up to  50 percent of the fat in muffins and increase the  freshness of the baked goods for up to five days.   Tennessee  researchers found that lower protein,  soft-wheat flours can be used to produce reduced-fat  cookies similar in appearance and texture to full-fat cookies.                     Cukes kill germs.  Cucumbers larger than 2  inches in diameter are not suitable for commercial  pickling. To find a use for the discarded cukes,  Arkansas  food scientists are developing flavor extracts.  The natural flavors at very low concentrations have  been shown to be potent inhibitors of microbial  growth, including foodborne pathogens. The  cucumber flavors can also enhance flavors in other foods.

GX007-97-16602300	Competitive Agricultural Systems in a Global Economy     Until the Cows Come Home   Improving dairy herds and products.    The U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Land-Grant university research and extension are helping producers improve profitability, provide a safe milk supply and give consumers more choices in dairy products. Research done today will enable producers to respond to future market trends. Shoppers are buying more low-fat dairy products, and low-fat milk might one day come directly from the cow.     Payoff                Two-percent cows.  While low-fat (2 percent fat or less) milk consumption has increased from 22 to 62 percent of the total fluid milk market during the past 20 years, the fat content of raw fluid milk produced by dairy cows remains virtually unchanged.  Maryland  researchers have determined that trans-fatty acids are responsible for reducing the fat content in cow's milk. Since consumer demand for fat in all foods, including dairy products, has been decreasing, developing practical procedures to reduce milk's fat content would eliminate the cost of removing the fat later and give consumers the low-fat products they want.         One on one education.  Dairy management plans designed by  North Dakota State  Extension are tailored to individual producers and their production systems and limitations. One farm increased dairy income by $7,200 in its first month in the program. Balancing herd rations, improving feed bunk management and monitoring production helped increase annual income by more than $86,000. On another farm, two months of ration changes and timely nutrition monitoring resulted in seven pounds per day per cow of additional milk, adding $1,800 per month in income.         n The key to obesity?  Skim milk, low-fat yogurt and cheese may help reduce body fat, especially in women. This is good news, especially for the 97 million Americans who are overweight. A  Tennessee  study shows that calcium in low-fat dairy foods triggers a hormonal response that inhibits the body's production of fat cells and boosts breakdown of fat. The study found that women who consumed the most low-fat dairy products were 80 percent less likely to be obese.         Slow down the breakdown.  Milk contains plasmin, an enzyme that breaks down proteins. Plasmin helps cheese ripen faster and taste better, but it also can degrade milk products or products that contain whey from milk.  Purdue  researchers are isolating two enzyme inhibitors naturally present in milk that might control plasmin activity. By controlling plasmin, food processors may make tastier cheese and higher quality bakery products, meat and nutritional beverages. They may also lower production costs for those products.         Herd mentality. Utah State  Extension helped dairy farmers earn more per cow per year by implementing scientifically balanced rations through the Dairy Herd Improvement Association (DHIA). Cows in the program produced about 6,000 pounds more milk per year than non-DHIA cows. At current milk prices, that amounts to about $1,000 more per cow, or more than $15 million for the 116 Utah DHIA herds.         Bacterial defenders.  The growth and metabolic activities of bacterial cultures are vital in making foods such as cheese. Many bacterial cultures are susceptible to attack by viruses. Such attacks can lead to product losses, safety concerns and spoilage.  North Carolina State  researchers developed a system to defend bacteria from viruses. It traps and destroys new viruses as soon as they appear in fermentation environments. The cultured dairy product industry has already implemented this system in manufacturing cottage cheese and hard cheeses in some North American plants.         New markets for byproducts.  Cheese makers produce 90 pounds of whey for every 10 pounds of cheese they make. An important source of milk nutrients, whey is now widely incorporated into food, usually as a relatively inexpensive ingredient. Identifying higher-valued products from whey could benefit producers, processors and consumers.  Wisconsin  food scientists developed an ion exchange process to isolate valuable proteins from whey. Successes include: Lactoferrin, a protein that enhances the body's ability to fight infections and that could be added to infant formula to help babies absorb more iron, and glycomacropeptide, a potentially rich source of protein important for the one in 10,000 Americans with PKU disease. Lactoferrin is worth more than $135 per pound and glycomacro-peptide more than $30 per pound.         Younger mothers.  Reducing the time needed to raise a heifer to calving age can save dairy farmers money.  Wisconsin  dairy scientists found that they could reduce the averaging calving age through adjustments in the mixture of forages and grains. Cutting a month off the calving age saved  Wisconsin  dairy farmers $18 million per year in reduced feed costs.         New test may save lives.   Listeria  is one of the most dangerous foodborne pathogens. It kills about 30 percent of the estimated 1,800 people who get the illness each year in the United States. The pathogen is found in 3 percent to 5 percent of raw milk. Pasteurizing raw milk is critical in detroying this pathogen. However, research shows that while pathogenicity is reduced by pasteurization, the organism remains dangerous.  Penn State  researchers recently developed a new method that rapidly detects heat-injured  Listeria  in pasteurized milk. This will help ensure the safety of dairy products and the health of millions who consume these products.         Same taste, less fat. Ohio State  researchers found that homogenizing cream before making Swiss cheese allows the fat to be more evenly distributed throughout the cheese. This will allow cheese makers to produce a lower fat product with little loss in taste.  Ohio  leads the nation in Swiss cheese production, churning out 64 million pounds annually.

GX008-22-15503264	"Outbreak of  Escherichia coli  O157:H7 Infection Associated With  Eating Fresh Cheese Curds --- Wisconsin, June 1998                  On June 15, 1998, the Division of Public Health, Wisconsin Department of Health  and Family Services, was notified of eight laboratory-confirmed and four suspected   Escherichia coli  O157:H7 infections among west-central Wisconsin residents who became  ill during June 8--12. This report summarizes the outbreak investigation, which  implicated fresh (held <60 days) cheese curds from a dairy plant as the source of infection.  A primary case was defined as the first laboratory-confirmed case in a household;  a secondary case was one that occurred 3--8 days after a primary case in the same  household. A matched case-control study was conducted to assess potential sources of  infection. For the purposes of the case-control study, a case was defined as  culture-confirmed illness among residents of Chippewa and Eau Claire counties with illness onset  during June 7--18. For each case-patient, two community controls matched by sex and  age group (range: from <10 years within 2 years to   > 10 years within 5 years) were interviewed by telephone. Case-patients and controls were interviewed about food  exposures and potential risk factors for  E.  coli  O157:H7 infection within 7 days before onset  of illness.  In response to the case-control study, the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture,  Trade, and Consumer Protection visited dairy plant A to collect cheese samples, raw  ingredients, and packaging materials; to review employee food handling and hygienic  practices; and to assess potential sources of contamination from raw milk. Product and  environmental samples (e.g., vat surfaces and floor drains) from the dairy plant were  screened for phosphatase activity to identify evidence of raw milk.  Fifty-five laboratory-confirmed case-patients were identified, including two from  secondary households. Case-patients were from seven Wisconsin counties (27  from Chippewa and 16 from Eau Claire counties); two case-patients were visiting from out  of state. Median age was 27 years (range: 15 months--90 years) and 37 (67%) were  female. The most frequently reported symptoms included bloody diarrhea (55 [100%]),  cramps (50 [91%]), fatigue (39 [71%]), and nausea (38 [69%]). Mean duration of diarrhea was  5.1 and 4.5 days for 25 hospitalized and 30 nonhospitalized case-patients, respectively.  Eating fresh cheese curds during June 1--17 was reported by all 24 case-patients  in Chippewa and Eau Claire counties and eight (18%) of 45 controls (matched  odds ratio=undefined; 95% confidence interval=20.6--infinity). Illness was not linked to  eating other cheese products (e.g., shredded, sliced, block, or string cheese). Of the 43  laboratory-confirmed case-patients whose cheese curd source could be identified, all had  eaten fresh cheese curds produced at dairy plant A; 19 had purchased the curds from  an   unrefrigerated display at plant A, and 24 had purchased them refrigerated from  retail stores that received shipments from plant A. Fifteen (50%) of 30 case-patients  who recalled the purchase date had bought the curds on June 5 or 6. The median number  of curds eaten was eight (range: one--28), the equivalent of approximately 1.6 oz of cheese.  Thirty-five specimens from plant A that were produced during the outbreak  were tested: nine environmental samples, 18 unopened cheese samples, six opened  retail packages of curds, and two unopened retail packages of curds. Five of the six  opened retail packages of curds and four of the 18 unopened cheese samples were positive  for nonbacterial phosphatase (Scharer method).  E.  coli  O157:H7 was isolated from an opened package of curds that had been served at a party attended by nine persons  with culture-confirmed illness. The contents of this package tested positive for  nonbacterial phosphatase. Among 44  E. coli  O157:H7 case-patient isolates available for  pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, 42 were indistinguishable from each other and from the curd isolate.  Dairy plant A had produced four or five vats of pasteurized cheddar and Colby  cheese products 5 days a week since 1977. Each vat yielded approximately 1500 pounds  of cheese that was pressed into 40-lb blocks, daisies (rounds of cheese), or was  packaged as fresh cheese curds. Dairy plant A also produced unpasteurized (raw milk)  cheddar cheese daisies every June as part of Dairy Month. Certain raw milk cheese products  can be produced and sold legally as long as the cheese is held at   > 35 F ( > 1.7 C) for at least 60 days before it is sold*. Curds are sold fresh (held <60 days); therefore, curds must  be made with pasteurized milk. At least one 1500-lbs vat of raw milk cheddar cheese  was made on May 27 and June 2--5. These vats were used inadvertently to make fresh  curds, which were incorrectly labeled ""pasteurized"" cheddar cheese curds, and distributed  and sold in six Wisconsin counties.  Reported by: J Durch, MPH, T Ringhand, MPH, Chippewa County Dept of Public  Health, Chippewa Falls; K Manner, M Barnett, Wisconsin Dept of Agriculture, Trade, and  Consumer Protection; M Proctor, PhD, S Ahrabi-Fard, MS, Communicable Disease Epidemiology Section;   J Davis, MD, State Epidemiologist for Communicable Disease, Wisconsin Div of Public  Health. D Boxrud, Minnesota Health Dept. Foodborne and Diarrheal Diseases Br, Div of Bacterial  and Mycotic Diseases, National Center for Infectious Diseases; and an EIS Officer, CDC.   Editorial Note:     Cheese is made in vats by coagulating milk with enzymes and/or  acids. After whey is drained, the large cheese clumps are removed and milled into  curds, salted, and packaged in small plastic bags for sale. Raw milk consumption has  been associated with campylobacteriosis, salmonellosis,   E. coli  O157:H7, yersiniosis, listeriosis, tuberculosis, brucellosis, cryptosporidiosis, and staphylococcal enterotoxin  poisoning ( 1 ). In 1950, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required manufacturers  of soft and fresh cheeses to use pasteurized milk and allowed raw milk to be used only  for certain aged cheeses ( 2 ). In 1986,  E.  coli  O157:H7 illness was associated with  consuming raw milk ( 3 ). In 1987, FDA banned the interstate sale of raw milk in retail  packages. During 1973--1992, 40 (87%) of 46 raw milk-associated outbreaks occurred in the  28 states that permitted the intrastate sale of raw milk  ( 4 ). During the same period, 11 of 32 cheese-associated outbreaks were attributed to contamination before distribution  ( 5 ).  This outbreak investigation illustrates the hazards of using raw milk to produce  commercial products that may lead to mislabeling or contaminating pasteurized product  by equipment or ingredients. This practice can result in pasteurized products  contaminated by equipment or ingredients and in product mislabeling. States that allow the sale  of unpasteurized milk or dairy products made from unpasteurized milk should take  appropriate steps to reduce the risk for contamination and mislabeling to prevent  similar outbreaks.

Oranges are highly valued for their vitamin C content. It is a primary source of vitamin C for most Americans. This wonderful fruit       has more to offer nutritionally than just this one nutrient, containing       sufficient amounts of folacin, calcium, potassium, thiamin, niacin and       magnesium. Most of the consumption of oranges is in the form of juice.       Eating the whole fruit provides 130% of the recommended dietary allowance       for vitamin C, less than the juice, but more fiber, which is not present       in the juice.         The fruit is technically a hesperidium, a kind of berry. It consists of       several easily separated carpels, or sections, each containing several       seeds and many juice cells, covered by a leathery skin, containing       numerous oil glands. Orange trees are evergreens, seldom exceeding 30 ft       in height. The leaves are oval and glossy and the flowers are white and       fragrant.                These semitropical evergreens probably originated in Southeast Asia.       Columbus and other European travelers brought sweet orange seed and       seedlings with them to the New World. By 1820 there were groves in St Augustine, Florida, and by the end of the Civil War oranges were being       shipped north in groves. A freeze produced a major set back in production       in 1895, but by 1910 crops in Florida had been reestablished.        Florida is the number one citrus producer, producing 70% of the U.S. crop,       with 90% of that going into juice. However, Arizona, Texas, and California       also produce small amounts, with variations in color and peel.

Look for fruit that is firm and heavy for its size, with bright,       colorful skins. Skin color is not a good guide to quality. Fruits may be       ripe even though they may have green spots. Avoid fruit with bruised,       wrinkled or discolored skins; this indicates the fruit is old or has been       stored incorrectly. Citrus fruit peel may vary in thickness, depending on       weather conditions during the growing season. Thinner skins tend to be       juicier than thick skin fruits.         Storage         Oranges can be stored at room temperature, in the refrigerator without       plastic bags or in the crisper drawer for up to 2 weeks. They do not ripen       further after harvest. Fresh-squeezed juice and grated peel or zest may be       refrigerated or frozen, but whole citrus fruit should not be frozen.                       Oranges may exhibit some re-greening of the skin; this does not adversely       affect internal fruit quality. Neither does surface scarring, which occurs       when wind brushed young fruit against the tree.                Varieties         Varieties include the sweet orange, the sour orange, and the mandarin       orange, or tangerine. The United States produces the sweet variety. Spain       produces the sour variety, Seville, which is used in marmalades and       liquers. Most all oranges have a yellow orange color with sizes ranging       from small to large. The inside of an orange is plump and juicy. Sweet       favorites include the Blood, Hamlin, Jaffa, Navel, Pineapple and Valencia. The color depends on the climate. Florida's warm days and       nights produce oranges with some green in the skin coloring. California       and Arizona oranges tend to have deeper orange color due to cooler desert       nights.                The principal varieties of the sweet orange cultivated by orange growers       of the eastern United States are the Hamlin and Parson Brown, both       early-maturing, seedy varieties with thin, russet skin and juicy pulp.       Both eastern and western growers cultivate the Valencia, a late variety       that is commercially seedless. Fresh oranges from California and Arizona       are available throughout the year, with two major varieties, Navels and       Valencias. The Moro orange (a type of blood orange) and the red Cara Navel       are two western-grown seasonal varieties. The Navel orange is a seedless       orange, with medium-thick rind, in which a second small, orange grows. A       variety of the Washington Navel orange is the principal orange product of       Texas.                                             Make Oranges Part of Your 5 A Day Plan                               Drink a cool glass of orange juice for breakfast or serve                 orange halves instead of grapefruit for a change.                 Combine the juice with other fruits and yogurt in the blender                 for a smoothie any time of day.                 A couple of tablespoons of orange juice concentrate can be                 added to a fruit cup for a great flavorful sauce.                 Cut oranges into wedges and eat them for a light snack or use                 them as edible garnishes.                 Buy a zesting tool or grate orange rind to use in recipes,                 rice, or stir fry for added flavor.                 Carry an orange with you wherever you go, they come in their                 own covered container so you can just peel and eat orange                 segments whenever the snack craze occurs.                 Orange juice can be used over fresh fruits to prevent                 browning.                                                                                                                      Recipes         Orange       Sorbet         Makes 8 ( ½  cup) servings.

GX001-92-13282913	"Walk into today's food store and                               you'll see fresh fruits available in                               fairly constant supply during the                               entire year. Fresh fruits add color                               and variety to any meal. Because                               of their natural sweetness, they are                               great for dessert and are a good                               low-fat snack alternative.                                                               Points to Consider              Wholesomeness...quality...nutritive value... convenience...methods of use...and     informative labeling are some of the points to consider when purchasing fresh fruits.              Wholesomeness              Do it yourself. There is no substitute for your own experience in choosing the right     quality of fresh fruit for different uses. Tips in this booklet can help you achieve     satisfaction and save money.              Don't buy just because of low price. It seldom pays to buy perishable fruits merely     because the price is low. Unless the lower price is a result of overabundance of the fruit     at the time, the so-called bargain may be undesirable.              Buy only what you need. Home refrigeration makes it possible to keep an adequate supply     of most perishable fruits on hand, but never buy more than you can properly refrigerate     and use without waste -- even if the product is cheaper in quantity.              Keep on the lookout for deterioration. Even with the most modern handling methods,     product quality can decline rapidly on display. Sometimes, this off-quality fruit can be     bought for less money, but the waste in preparation may offset the price reduction.              Appearance and quality are closely associated in many respects, but fine appearance     does not always denote fine quality. Often a very attractive fruit may not taste good     because of a varietal characteristic, or because of some internal condition such as     overmaturity. On the other hand, a fruit with poor appearance due to poor color or     superficial blemishes may be delicious.              Buy in season. Quality is usually higher and prices are more reasonable when fruit is     in season. Out-of-season produce is generally more expensive.              When you must handle a fruit to judge its quality, use thoughtful care to prevent     injury. Rough handling causes spoilage and waste. The consumer pays for carelessness in     the long run.              Nutritive Value              Fresh fruits and fruit juices contain many vitamins and minerals, they are low in fat     (except avocados) and sodium, and they provide dietary fiber. USDA nutritionists recommend     2 to 4 servings from the fruit group each day. Count as a serving an individual unit (one     medium apple, pear, banana, orange), a fraction of a unit (grapefruit half, melon wedge),     1/2 cup berries, 1/2 cup chopped or cooked fruit, or 3/4 cup fruit juice. Whole, unpeeled     fruit is higher in fiber than peeled fruit or fruit juice.              Labeling              Under federal guidelines, a substantial number of retailers must provide nutrition     information for the 20 most frequently eaten raw fruits. These fruits are: bananas,     apples, watermelons, oranges, cantaloupes, grapes, grapefruit, strawberries, peaches,     pears, nectarines, honeydew melons, plums, avocados, lemons, pineapples, tangerines, sweet     cherries, kiwifruit, and limes. Information about other fruits may also be provided. The     nutritional information may appear on posters, brochures, leaflets, or stickers near the     fruit display. It may include serving size; calories per serving; amount of protein, total     carbohydrates, total fat, and sodium per serving; and percent of the U.S. Recommended     Daily Allowances for iron, calcium, and vitamins A and C per serving.              Quality              Some fruits are labeled with a USDA quality grade. The quality of most fresh fruits can     be judged reasonably well by their external appearance. Therefore, by following the guide     provided in this booklet, consumers usually can make a good selection of fresh fruits from     retail display counters even without the help of a grade mark or other identification of     quality.              Quality Grades For Fresh Fruit              The U.S. Department of Agriculture has established grade standards for most fresh     fruits. The grades are used extensively as a basis for trading among growers, shippers,     wholesalers, and retailers. Grade standards are used to a limited extent in sales from     retailers to consumers.              Use of U.S. grade standards is voluntary. In most cases, however, some State laws and     Federal marketing programs require grading and grade labeling of certain fruits.              Most packers grade their fruits, and some mark consumer packages with the grade. If a     package carries a grade, the packer is legally obligated to make the contents measure up     to official grade requirements. Some shippers, wholesalers, and distributors use USDA or     State grading services.              Grade designations are most often seen on packages of pears and apples. Other fruits     occasionally carry the grade designations.                              U.S. Fancy                           Fancy means premium quality. Only a small percentage of fruits are     packed in this grade.                              U.S. No. 1                           U.S. No. 1 means good quality and is the most commonly used grade for     most fruits.                              U.S. No. 2 and U.S. No. 3                           U.S. No. 2 is noticeably superior to U.S. No. 3 which     is the lowest grade practical to pack under normal commercial conditions.              A Consumer's Guide to Buying Fruit              The following alphabetical list of fruits is designed as a reference to help you shop     more intelligently. Some of the terms used (such as ""mature"" and     ""ripe"") have special meanings in the produce field. A brief glossary in the back     of this booklet will help you understand these terms.              Apples              The many varieties of apples differ widely in appearance, flesh characteristics,     seasonal availability, and suitability for different uses.              For good eating as fresh fruit, the commonly available varieties are: Red Delicious,     McIntosh, Granny Smith, Empire, and Golden Delicious. For making pies and applesauce, use     tart or slightly acid varieties such as Gravenstein, Grimes Golden, Jonathan, and Newtown.              For baking, the firmer fleshed varieties -- Rome Beauty, Northern Spy, Rhode Island     Greening, Winesap, and York Imperial -- are widely used.                              Look for:                           Firm, crisp, well-colored apples. Flavor varies in apples, and depends     on the stage of maturity at the time that the fruit is picked. Apples must be mature when     picked to have a good flavor, texture, and storing ability. Immature apples lack color and     are usually poor in flavor. They may have a shriveled appearance after being held in     storage.              Most apples are marketed by grade, and consumer packages show the variety, the grade,     and the size. U.S. grades for apples are: U.S. Extra Fancy, U.S. Fancy, U.S. No. 1, and     combinations of these grades. U.S. Utility is a less desirable grade. Apples from the far     Western States are usually marketed under State grades which are similar to the U.S.     grades.                              Avoid:                           Overripe apples (indicated by a yielding to slight pressure on the skin,     and soft, mealy flesh) and apples affected by freeze (indicated by internal breakdown and     bruised areas). Scald on apples (irregularly shaped tan or brown areas) may not seriously     affect the taste.              Apricots              Most fresh apricots are marketed in June and July, but a limited supply of imported     apricots is available in large cities during December and January. Domestic apricots are     grown principally in California, Washington, and Utah.              Apricots develop their flavor and sweetness on the tree, and should be mature but firm     at the time that they are picked.                              Look for:                           Apricots that are plump and juicy looking, with a uniform,     golden-orange color. Ripe apricots will yield to gentle pressure on the skin.                              Avoid:                           Dull-looking, soft, or mushy fruit, and very firm, pale yellow, or     greenish-yellow fruit. These indicate overmaturity or immaturity, respectively.              Avocados              Avocados, grown in California and Florida, are available all year. Two general types,     and a number of varieties of each, are grown. Depending upon type and variety, avocados     vary greatly in shape, size, and color. Most tend to be pear-shaped, but some are almost     spherical. Fruits weighing under 1/2 pound are most commonly available. Some have rough or     leathery textured skin, while others have smooth skin. The skin color of most varieties is     some shade of green, but certain varieties turn maroon, brown, or purplish-black as they     ripen.              Despite this variation in appearance, avocados are of good eating quality when they are     properly ripened, becoming slightly soft. This ripening process normally takes from 3 to 5     days at room temperature for the quite firm avocados usually found in food stores.     Ripening can be slowed by refrigeration.                              Look for:                           For immediate use, select slightly soft avocados which yield to gentle     pressure on the skin. For use in a few days, buy firm fruits that do not yield to the     squeeze test. Leave them at room temperature to ripen.              Irregular light-brown markings are sometimes found on the outside skin. These markings     generally have no effect on the flesh of the avocado.                              Avoid:                           Avocados with dark sunken spots in irregular patches or cracked or broken     surfaces. These are signs of decay.                              An extra tip:                           When preparing avocados, to avoid the browning of avocado flesh     when exposed to air, immediately place the peeled fruit in lemon juice until ready for     use.              Bananas              Unlike most other fruits, bananas develop their best eating quality after they are     harvested. This allows bananas to be shipped great distances. Almost our entire supply of     bananas, available year-round, is imported from Central and South America. Bananas are     sensitive to cool temperatures and will be injured in temperatures below 55 F. For this     reason, they should never be kept in the refrigerator. The ideal temperature for ripening     bananas is between 60 and 70 F. Higher temperatures cause them to ripen too rapidly.                              Look for:                           Bananas which are firm, bright in appearance, and free from bruises or     other injury. The state of ripeness is indicated by skin color. Best eating quality has     been reached when the solid yellow color is specked with brown. At this stage, the flesh     is mellow and the flavor is fully developed. Bananas with green tips or with practically     no yellow color have not developed their full flavor potential.                              Avoid:                           Bruised fruit (indicating rapid deterioration and waste); discolored     skins (a sign of decay); a dull, grayish, aged appearance (showing that the bananas have     been exposed to cold and will not ripen properly).              Occasionally, the skin may be entirely brown and yet the flesh will still be in prime     condition.              Blueberries              Fresh blueberries are on the market from May through September. Generally, the large     berries are cultivated varieties and the smaller berries are wild varieties.                              Look for:                           A dark blue color with a silvery bloom is the best indication of     quality. This silvery bloom is a natural, protective, waxy coating. Buy blueberries that     are plump, firm, uniform in size, dry, and free from stems or leaves.                              Avoid:                           Soft, mushy, or leaking berries.              Cherries              Excellent as dessert fruit, most sweet cherries found in the food store are produced in     the Western States and are available from May through August. Red tart cherries, also     called sour or pie cherries and used mainly in cooked desserts, have a softer flesh,     lighter red color, and a tart flavor. They generally are shipped to processing plants and     are sold frozen or canned.                              Look for:                           A very dark color is your most important indication of good flavor and     maturity in sweet cherries. Bing, Black Tartarian, Schmidt, Chapman, and Republican     varieties should range from deep maroon or mahogany red to black for richest flavor.     Lambert cherries should be dark red. Rainier cherries should be straw-colored. Good     cherries have bright, glossy, plump-looking surfaces and fresh-looking stems.                              Avoid:                           Overmature cherries lacking in flavor, indicated by shrivelling, dried     stems, and a generally dull appearance. Decay is fairly common at times on sweet cherries,     but because of the normal dark color, decayed areas are often inconspicuous. Soft, leaking     flesh, brown discoloration, and mold growth are indications of decay.              Cranberries              A number of varieties of fresh cranberries are marketed in large volume from September     through January. They differ considerably in size and color, but are not identified by     variety names in your food store.                              Look for:                           Plump, firm berries with a lustrous color provide the best quality.     Duller varieties should at least have some red color.                              Avoid:                           Brown or dark, discolored berries and soft, spongy, or leaky berries     should be sorted out before cooking, because they may produce an off-flavor.              Grapefruit              Grapefruit is available all year, with most abundant supplies from January through May.     While Florida is the major source of fresh grapefruit, there also is substantial     production in Texas, California, and Arizona. Several varieties are marketed, but the     principal distinction at retail is between those which are ""seedless"" (having     few or no seeds) and the ""seeded"" type. Another distinction is color of flesh.     Pink- or red-fleshed fruit is most common, but white-fleshed varieties are also available.              Grapefruit is picked ""tree ripe"" and is ready to eat when you buy it in the     store.                              Look for:                           Firm fruits, heavy for their size, are usually the best eating.     Thin-skinned fruits have more juice than coarse-skinned ones. If a grapefruit is pointed     at the stem end, it is likely to be thick-skinned. Rough, ridged, or wrinkled skin can     also be an indication of thick skin, pulpiness, and lack of juice.              Grapefruit often have skin defects such as scale, scars, thorn scratches, or     discoloration. This usually does not affect how the fruit tastes.                              Avoid:                           Soft, water-soaked areas, lack of bright color, and soft, tender peel     that breaks easily with finger pressure are symptoms of decay.              Grapes              Most table grapes available in food stores are of the European type, grown principally     in California and Arizona. Only small quantities of Eastern-grown American-type grapes are     sold for table use.              European types are firm-fleshed and generally have high sugar content. Common varieties     are Thompson seedless (an early, green grape), Red seedless (an early, red grape), Tokay     and Cardinal (early, bright-red, seeded grapes), and Emperor (late, deep-red, seeded     grapes). These all have excellent flavor when well-matured.              American-type grapes have softer flesh and are juicier than European types. The     outstanding variety for flavor is the Concord, which is blue-black when fully matured.     Delaware and Catawba are also popular.                              Look for:                           Well-colored, plump grapes that are firmly attached to the stem. White     or green grapes are sweetest when the color has a yellowish cast or straw color, with a     tinge of amber. Red varieties are better when good red predominates on all or most of the     berries. Bunches are more likely to hold together if the stems are predominantly green and     pliable.                              Avoid:                           Soft or wrinkled grapes, or bunches of grapes with stems that are brown     and brittle; these are the effects of freezing or drying. Also avoid grapes with bleached     areas around the stem ends (indicating injury and poor quality), and leaking berries (a     sign of decay).              Kiwifruit              The kiwifruit is a relatively small, ellipsoid-shaped fruit with a bright green,     slightly acid-tasting pulp surrounding many small, black, edible seeds, which in turn     surround a pale heart. The exterior of the kiwifruit is unappealing to some, being     somewhat ""furry"" and light to medium brown in color. (While the furry skin is     edible, some prefer to peel the fruit before eating.) Domestic kiwifruit is produced     primarily in California, but imported kiwifruit is also commonly marketed.                              Look for:                           Plump, unwrinkled fruit, either firm or slightly yielding. Kiwifruit     is fully ripe when it is yielding to the touch but not soft. Firm kiwifruit can be ripened     at home in a few days by leaving it at room temperature. Use of a ripening bag or bowl     will speed the process.                              Avoid:                           Fruit that shows signs of shriveling, mold, or excessive softening, all     of which indicate spoilage. Some kiwifruit may appear to have a ""water-stained""     exterior. This is perfectly normal for the fruit and does not affect interior quality in     any way.                              Note:                           Kiwifruit contains an enzyme, actinidin, similar to papain in papayas,     that reacts chemically to break down proteins. (It has been used as a ""secret     ingredient"" to tenderize meat.) Actinidin prevents gelatin from setting, so if you     are going to serve kiwifruit in a gelatin dish, cook the fruit for a few minutes before     adding it to the gelatin.              Lemons              Most of the Nation's commercial lemon supply comes from California and Arizona, and is     available year-round.                              Look for:                           Lemons with a rich yellow color, reasonably smooth-textured skin with     a slight gloss, and those which are firm and heavy. A pale or greenish-yellow color means     very fresh fruit with slightly higher acidity. Coarse or rough skin texture is a sign of     thick skin and not much flesh.                              Avoid:                           Lemons with a darker yellow or dull color, or with hardened or shriveled     skin (signs of age), and those with soft spots, mold on the surface, and punctures of the     skin (signs of decay).              Limes              Most limes sold at retail are produced in Florida or imported from Mexico, and are     marketed when mature. Imported limes are mostly the smaller ""seeded"" lime.                              Look for:                           Limes with glossy skin and heavy weight for the size.                              Avoid:                           Limes with dull, dry skin (a sign of aging and loss of acid flavor), and     those showing evidence of decay (soft spots, mold, and skin punctures.)              Melons              Selection of melons for quality and flavor is difficult, challenging the skill of even     the most experienced buyer. Although no absolute formula exists, considering several     factors when judging a melon will increase the likelihood of success.              Cantaloupe (Muskmelons)              Cantaloupe, generally available from May through September, are produced principally in     California, Arizona, and Texas. Some are also imported early in the season.                              Look for:                           There are three major signs of full maturity. First, the stem should     be gone, leaving a smooth symmetrical, shallow base called a ""full slip."" If all     or part of the stem base remains, or if the stem scar is jagged or torn, the melon is     probably not fully matured. Second, the netting, or veining, should be thick, coarse, and     corky, and should stand out in bold relief over some part of the surface. Third, the skin     color (ground color) between the netting should have changed from green to yellowish-buff,     yellowish-gray, or pale yellow.                              Signs of ripeness:                           A cantaloupe might be mature, but not ripe. A ripe cantaloupe     will have a yellowish cast to the rind, have a pleasant cantaloupe aroma, and yield     slightly to light thumb pressure on the blossom end of the melon.              Most cantaloupe are quite firm when freshly displayed in retail stores. While some may     be ripe, most have not yet reached their best eating stage. Hold them for 2 to 4 days at     room temperature to allow completion of ripening. After conditioning the melons, some     people like to place them in the refrigerator for a few hours before serving.                              Avoid:                           Overripeness is indicated by a pronounced yellow rind color, a softening     over the entire rind, and soft, watery, and insipid flesh. Small bruises normally will not     hurt the fruit, but large bruised areas should be avoided, since they generally cause     soft, water-soaked areas underneath the rind. Mold growth on the cantaloupe (particularly     in the stem scar, or if the tissue under the mold is soft and wet) is a sign of decay.              Casaba              This sweet, juicy melon is normally pumpkin-shaped with a very slight tendency to be     pointed at the stem end. It is not netted, but has shallow, irregular furrows running from     the stem end toward the blossom end. The rind is hard with light green or yellow color.     The stem does not separate from the melon, and must be cut in harvesting. The casaba melon     season is from July to November. Casabas are produced in California and Arizona.                              Look for:                           Ripe melons with a gold-yellow rind color and a slight softening at     the blossom end. Casabas have no aroma.                              Avoid:                           Dark, sunken, water-soaked spots which indicate decay.              Crenshaw              Its large size and distinctive shape make this melon easy to identify. It is rounded at     the blossom end and tends to be pointed at the stem end. The rind is relatively smooth     with only very shallow lengthwise furrowing. The flesh is pale orange, juicy, and     delicious; and generally considered outstanding in the melon family. Crenshaws are grown     in California from July through October, with peak shipments in August and September.                              Look for:                           There are three signs of ripeness. First, the rind should be generally     a deep golden yellow, sometimes with small areas having a lighter shade of yellow. Second,     the surface should yield slightly to moderate pressure, particularly at the blossom end.     Third, the melon should have a pleasant aroma.                              Avoid:                           Slightly sunken, water-soaked areas on the rind are signs of decay.              Honey Ball              The honey ball melon is very similar to the honey dew melon, except that it is much     smaller, very round, and slightly and irregularly netted over the surface. Use the same     buying tips for this melon as for the honey dew melon.              Honey Dew              The outstanding flavor characteristics of honey dews make them highly prized as a     dessert fruit. The melon is large (4 to 8 lb.), bluntly oval in shape, and generally very     smooth with only occasional traces of surface netting. The rind is firm and ranges from     creamy white to creamy yellow, depending on the stage of ripeness. The stem does not     separate from the fruit, and must be cut for harvesting.              Honey dews are available to some extent almost all year round, due in part to imports     during the winter and spring. Chief sources, however, are California, Arizona, and Texas.     The most abundant supplies are available from July through October.                              Look for:                           A soft, velvety texture indicates maturity. Slight softening at the     blossom end, a faint pleasant fruit aroma, and yellowish-white to creamy rind color     indicate ripeness.                              Avoid:                           Dead-white or greenish-white color and a hard, smooth feel are signs of     immaturity. Large, water-soaked, bruised areas are signs of injury; and cuts or punctures     through the rind usually lead to decay. Small, superficial, sunken spots do not damage the     melon for immediate use, but large decayed spots will.              Persian              Persian melons resemble cantaloupe, but are more nearly round, have finer netting, and     are about the same size as honey dews. The flesh is thick, fine-textured, and     orange-colored. Grown primarily in California, they are available in fair supply in August     and September.                              Look for:                           The same quality and ripeness factors listed for cantaloupe apply to     Persian melons.              Watermelons              Although watermelons are available to some degree from early May through September,     peak supplies come in June, July, and August. Judging the quality of a watermelon is very     difficult unless it is cut in half or quartered.                              Look for:                           Firm, juicy flesh with good red color that is free from white streaks;     and seeds which are dark brown or black. Seedless watermelons often contain small white,     immature seeds, which are normal for this type.                              Avoid:                           Melons with pale-colored flesh, white streaks (or ""white     heart""), and whitish seeds (indicating immaturity). Dry, mealy flesh, or watery     stringy flesh are signs of overmaturity or aging after harvest.              If you want to buy an uncut watermelon, here are a few appearance factors which may be     helpful (though not totally reliable) in guiding you to a satisfactory selection. The     watermelon surface should be relatively smooth; the rind should have a slight dullness     (neither shiny nor dull); the ends of the melon should be filled out and rounded; and the     underside, or ""belly"" of the melon should have a creamy color.              Nectarines              This fruit, available from June through September from California, combines     characteristics of both the peach and the plum.                              Look for:                           Rich color and plumpness, and a slight softening along the     ""seam"" of the nectarine. Most varieties have an orange-yellow background color     between the red areas, but some varieties have a greenish background color. Bright-looking     fruits which are firm to moderately hard will probably ripen normally within 2 or 3 days     at room temperature.                              Avoid:                           Hard, dull fruits or slightly shriveled fruits (which may be immature --     picked too soon -- and of poor eating quality) and soft or overripe fruits or those with     cracked or punctured skin or other signs of decay.              Russeting or staining of the skin may affect the appearance but not detract from the     internal quality of the nectarine.              Oranges              California, Florida, Texas, and Arizona produce our year-round supply of oranges.              Leading varieties from California and Arizona are the Washington Navel and the     Valencia, both characterized by a rich orange skin color. The Navel orange, available from     November until early May, has a thicker, somewhat more pebbled skin than the Valencia; the     skin is more easily removed by hand, and the segments separate more readily. It is ideally     suited for eating as a whole fruit or in segments in salads. The western Valencia orange,     available from late April through October, is excellent either for juicing or for slicing     in salads.              Florida and Texas orange crops are marketed from early October until late June. Parson     Brown and Hamlin are early varieties, while the Pineapple orange -- an important,     high-quality orange for eating -- is available from late November through March. Florida     and Texas Valencias are marketed from late March through June. The Florida Temple orange     is available from early December until early March. Somewhat like the California Navel, it     peels easily, separates into segments readily, and has excellent flavor.              Oranges are required by strict State regulations to be mature before being harvested     and shipped out of the producing State. Thus, skin color is not a reliable index of     quality, and a greenish cast or green spots do not mean that the orange is immature. Often     fully matured oranges will turn greenish (called ""regreening"") late in the     marketing season. Some oranges are artificially colored to improve their appearance. This     practice has no effect on eating quality, but artificially colored fruits must be labeled     ""color added.""              ""Discoloration"" is often found on Florida and Texas oranges, but not on     California oranges. This is a tan, brown, or blackish mottling or specking over the skin.     It has no effect on eating quality, and in fact often occurs on oranges with thin skin and     superior eating quality.                              Look for:                           Firm and heavy oranges with fresh, bright-looking skin which is     reasonably smooth for the variety.                              Avoid:                           Light-weight oranges, which are likely to lack flesh content and juice.     Very rough skin texture indicates abnormally thick skin and less flesh. Dull, dry skin and     spongy texture indicate aging and deteriorated eating quality. Also avoid decay -- shown     by cuts or skin punctures, soft spots on the surface, and discolored, weakened areas of     skin around the stem end or button.              Peaches              A great many varieties of peaches are grown, but only an expert can distinguish one     from another. These varieties, available May to November, fall into two general types:     freestone (flesh readily separates from the pit) and clingstone (flesh clings tightly to     the pit). Freestones are usually preferred for eating fresh or for freezing, while     clingstones are used primarily for canning, although they are sometimes sold fresh.                              Look for:                           Peaches which are fairly firm or becoming a trifle soft. The skin     color between the red areas (ground color) should be yellow or at least creamy.                              Avoid:                           Very firm or hard peaches with a distinctly green ground color, which are     probably immature and won't ripen properly. Also avoid very soft fruits which are     overripe. Don't buy peaches with large flattened bruises (they'll have large areas of     discolored flesh underneath) or peaches with any sign of decay. Decay starts as a pale tan     spot which expands in a circle and gradually turns darker in color.              Pears              The most popular variety of pear is the Bartlett, which is produced in great quantities     (in California, Washington, and Oregon) both for canning and for sale as a fresh fruit.     With the aid of cold storage, Bartlett pears are available from early August through     November.              Several fall and winter varieties of pears are grown in Washington, Oregon, and     California, and shipped to fresh fruit markets. These varieties -- Anjou, Bosc, Winter     Nellis, and Comice -- keep well in cold storage and are available over a long period, from     November until May.                              Look for:                           Firm pears of all varieties. The color depends on variety. For     Bartletts, look for a pale yellow to rich yellow color; Anjou or Comice -- light green to     yellowish-green; Bosc -- greenish-yellow to brownish-yellow (the brown cast is caused by     skin russeting, a characteristic of the Bosc pear); Winter Nellis -- medium to light     green.              Pears which are hard when you find them in the food store will probably ripen if kept     at room temperature, but it is wise to select pears that have already begun to soften --     to be reasonably sure that they will ripen satisfactorily.                              Avoid:                           Wilted or shriveled pears with dull-appearing skin and slight weakening     of the flesh near the stem, which indicates immaturity. These pears will not ripen. Also     avoid spots on the sides or blossom ends of the pear, which means that corky tissue may be     underneath.              Pineapples              Pineapples are available all year, but are most abundant from March through June.     Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Mexico are principal suppliers. Present marketing practices,     including air shipments, allow pineapples to be harvested as nearly ripe as possible. They     are delivered to market near the peak of sweetness, with color ranging from green to     orange and yellow. A mature green pineapple will normally turn yellow to orange within a     few days at room temperature, but many are already fully colored when you find them in the     food store.                              Look for:                           Bright color, fragrant pineapple aroma, and a very slight separation     of the eyes or pips -- the berry-like fruitlets patterned in a spiral on the fruit core.     At their mature stage, pineapples are usually dark green, firm, plump, and heavy for their     size. The larger the fruit, the greater the proportion of edible flesh.              As the popular varieties ripen, the green color turns to orange and yellow. When fully     colored, pineapples are golden yellow, orange-yellow, or reddish brown, depending on the     variety.                              Avoid:                           Pineapples with sunken or slightly pointed pips, dull yellowish-green     color, and dried appearance -- all signs of immaturity. Also avoid bruised fruit, shown by     discolored or soft spots, which are susceptible to decay. Other signs of decay are traces     of mold, unpleasant odor, and eyes which are dark and watery.              Plums and Prunes              Quality characteristics for both are very similar, and the same buying tips apply to     both.              Plums -- A number of varieties of plums are produced in California and are available     from June to September. Varieties differ slightly in appearance and flavor, so you should     buy and taste one to see if that variety appeals to you.              Prunes -- Only a few varieties of prunes are commonly marketed, and they are all very     similar. Prunes are purplish-black or bluish-black, with a moderately firm flesh which     separates freely from the pit. Most commercial production is in the Northwestern States.     Fresh prunes are available in food stores from August through October.                              Look for:                           Plums and prunes with a good color for the variety, in a fairly firm     to slightly soft stage of ripeness.                              Avoid:                           Fruits with skin breaks, punctures, or brownish discoloration. Also avoid     immature fruits (relatively hard, poorly colored, very tart, sometimes shriveled) and     overmature fruits (excessively soft, possibly leaking or decaying).              Raspberries, Boysenberries, etc.              Blackberries, raspberries, dewberries, loganberries, and youngberries are similar in     general structure. They differ from one another in shape or color, but quality factors are     about the same for all.                              Look for:                           A bright, clean appearance and a uniform good color for the species.     The individual small cells making up the berry should be plump and tender but not mushy.     Look for berries that are fully ripened, with no attached stem caps.                              Avoid:                           Leaky and moldy berries. You can usually spot them through the openings     in the ventilated plastic containers. Also look for wet or stained spots on wood or fiber     containers, as possible signs of poor quality or spoiled berries.              Strawberries              First shipments of strawberries come from southern Florida in January, and then     production increases, gradually spreading north and west into many parts of the country     before tapering off in the fall. Strawberries are in best supply in May and June.                              Look for:                           Berries with a full red color and a bright luster, firm flesh, and the     cap stem still attached. The berries should be dry and clean, and usually medium to small     strawberries have better eating quality then large ones.                              Avoid:                           Berries with large uncolored areas or with large seedy areas (poor in     flavor and texture), a full shrunken appearance or softness (signs of overripeness or     decay), or those with mold, which can spread rapidly from one berry to another.                              Note:                           In most containers of strawberries you will likely find a few that are     less desirable than others. Try to look at some of berries lower in the container to be     sure that they are reasonably free from defects or decay.              Tangerines              Florida is the chief source of tangerines. Considerable quantities of tangerines and     similar types of oranges are produced in California and Arizona, some in Texas, and few     are imported. Tangerines are available from late November until early March, with peak     supplies in December and January. The Murcott, a large, excellent variety of orange     resembling the tangerine, is available from late February through April.                              Look for:                           Deep yellow or orange color and a bright luster is your best sign of     fresh, mature, good-flavored tangerines. Because of the typically loose nature of     tangerine skins, they will frequently not feel firm to the touch.                              Avoid:                           Very pale yellow or greenish fruits, which are likely to be lacking in     flavor (although small green areas on otherwise high-colored fruit are not bad), and     tangerines with cut or punctured skins or very soft spots (all signs of decay, which     spreads rapidly).              A Consumer's Glossary of Fruit Terms                              Blossom end                           -- The opposite end from the stem end. The stem end will have a scar     or remains of the stem. The blossom end is often more rounded.                              Breakdown of tissue                           -- Decomposition or breaking down of cells due to pressure     (bruise) or age (internal breakdown).                              Decay                           -- Decomposition of the fruit due to bacteria or fungus infection.                              Ground Color                           -- The basic or background color of a fruit before the sun's rays     cause the skin to redden. The ground color may be seen beneath and between the red blush     of the fruit.                              Degree of Ripeness                           -- The terms ""hard,"" ""firm,"" and     ""soft,"" are subjective terms used to describe the degrees of maturity or     ripeness of a fruit. A ""hard"" texture will not give when pressed. A     ""firm"" texture will give slightly to pressure. A ""soft"" texture will     be soft to the touch.                              Mature                           -- Describes a fruit that is ready to be picked, whether or not it is     ripe at this time. If a fruit is picked when mature, it can ripen properly, but if picked     when immature, it cannot ripen properly.                              Netting                           -- The vein-like network of lines running randomly across the rinds of     some melons.                              Ripe                           -- Describes a fruit that is ready to be eaten.                              Russeting                           -- A lacy, brownish, blemish-type coating on top of the skin.                                            For more information about nutrition, write:                           U.S. Department of Agriculture,                           Human Nutrition Information Service,                           6505 Belcrest Road,                           Hyattsville, MD 20782.

Cooperative Extension   Project Background           In 1997, over 90 cases of     Salmonella  Typhimurium   DT 104 were    reported in Yakima County, Washington.                 Symptoms included diarrhea,    fever, abdominal pain, bloody stool,vomiting.         Median age was 4 years old.         Majority of cases involved    children of Hispanic heritage.         A CDC study implicated    unpasteurized-milk  queso fresco  as the    source of the  Salmonella  infections.         Centers for Disease Control and    Prevention (CDC) emphasized the need for an    intervention.                   Pre-Intervention Salmonellosis  Cases   (line graph showing increase in  cases of S.

Many people were aware of the    risks of raw milk. However, they continued to    make raw-milk  queso fresco  to preserve    their cultural heritage.         Behavior change was prompted by    availability of a safer recipe that yielded an    acceptable product.         Mexican-Americans were very    receptive to using the recipe for pasteurized    milk  queso fresco  because:             The pasteurized milk cheese      was safer to eat.             The recipe was easier to make      than the traditional recipe.             The recipe produced a good      tasting cheese.              We modified a recipe developed      by a respected women in the community, which      encouraged acceptance of the recipe.                 The incentives encouraged    participation in the safe cheese workshops.     Pre and Post Intervention  Community Surveys       We surveyed people who did not    participate in safe cheese workshops to see if    the publicity had increased awareness of risks    of raw milk  queso fresco.       Does Raw-Milk  Queso Fresco   Cause Illness?   X 2  = 25.3  (significant/p<.01)   Pre           Yes, n=24         No, n=33         Don't Know, n=22     Post           Yes, n=84         No, n=20         Don't Know, n=45     Post Intervention Salmonella  Cases   (line graph shows that  post-intervention - 1997 - the number of  S.  Typhimurium  cases in Yakima County and  Washington State declined.)   The Intervention was Successful!           Incidence of  Salmonella     infections dropped rapidly during the    intervention.             Avoiding illness of the      children appears to have been a prime      motivator.                 The cultural tradition of home    preparation of  queso fresco  was    preserved.         Some of the unlicensed small    vendors who were formerly selling raw-milk     queso fresco  are now licensed and sell    pasteurized-milk  queso fresco .     Reflections           Many food safety educational    campaigns focus on avoiding certain risky foods.         Encouraging people to abandon a    food custom accelerates cultural decomposition    and may be nutritionally deleterious.         If possible, interventions    should encourage modification rather than    elimination of traditional cultural foods.         Food safety interventions that    use the expertise of nutrition educators,    microbiologists, food scientists and    community-based educators are most likely to be    effective at reducing microbial risks,    maintaining the traditional taste of foods, and    preserving cultural food patterns.     Current Status of Project           Safe cheese workshops continue    to be held in dairy farming areas of Washington.             In Yakima County, rates of       Salmonella  infections rise without      continued intervention.                 Video showing the process of    making  queso fresco  was developed to use    when hands-on training was not feasible.     Sharing of materials           More than 10,000 copies of the    brochure have been distributed by WSU.         Brochure was reprinted by FDA    for distribution at Health Fairs in major US    cities.         Food safety educators in about    20 other countries have requested copies.             Home production of raw-milk      fresh cheese is common in many countries.             Educators have revised the      procedures as needed to produce the cheese      made in their locality.

In the winter I put  out field corn. Presently have one friendly female who  looks for a treat to be tossed her way.  Peanuts will not hurt squirrels, they love them. However, feeding wild mammals is usually not a very good idea, though lots of people do it. They can become dependent on you and possibly starve if you are not around in severe weather, and they may appear to become tame, will be used to approaching people, and will be vulnerable to people who aren't as ""friendly"" as you are. Also people-dependent squirrels sometimes bite people, particularly children, who think they look like pets, and then have to be destroyed. So my advice is to enjoy watching your squirrels but don't ""tame"" them. Let wildlife be wild. John Elliott ==================================================================== Most experts agree that squirrels who are fed peanuts regularly, do not seek other foods that provide them with their total nutritional needs. There are articles on this topic that can be found within a library.

Studying Hispanic Cheese May Help Scientists Improve Other Cheeses     By  Jim Core   December 3, 2002   Hispanic-style cheese made in Mexico may provide  Agricultural Research Service  scientists with a better scientific understanding of how to improve the overall quality of cheese in general.    ARS scientists at Wyndmoor, Pa., are working to mimic the desired properties of Hispanic cheeses while following U.S. cheesemaking practices and standards. They're using different Mexican cheeses as models to better understand how specific processing techniques result in certain desirable qualities. They hope to transfer their findings to improve the processing techniques of other cheeses.   Hispanic cheese is one of the fastest growing food markets in the United States. Production jumped about 52 percent from 1996 to 2001, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture's  National Agricultural Statistics Service .   Some Hispanic cheese tastes like fresh milk and becomes soft and creamy when heated but doesn't lose shape or run. Other cheeses melt but don't separate into greasy solids and liquids. Hispanic-style cheese does not mean hot and spicy; other ingredients make Hispanic dishes ""hot.""   Some American companies are producing quality Hispanic-style cheeses from pasteurized milk, but they don't exhibit the full flavors, textures and cooking properties of those made from raw milk.   Diane L. Van Hekken, a research chemist at the ARS  Eastern Regional Research Center 's  Dairy Processing and Products Research Unit  in Wyndmoor, is studying the properties of selected Hispanic cheeses. She hopes to modify existing cheesemaking techniques or develop new ones to improve the shelf life of Hispanic-style cheeses. This will expand their marketability and ensure high food safety standards.   Van Hekken co-hosted a symposium at the  Institute of Food Technologists  annual meeting in June to discuss this growing market with other researchers and producers. A taste panel in Wyndmoor has been working since May 2001 to define the flavor profiles of both raw and pasteurized cheeses.    ARS is the  USDA 's chief scientific research agency.

Raw milk, which            is used to produce these cheeses, gives them distinctive flavors, textures,            and cooking properties. Even though some American companies are producing            Hispanic-style cheeses from pasteurized milk (a U.S. requirement for            cheeses aged less than 60 days), these do not exhibit the full range            of properties of cheeses made from raw milk.                     Researchers at  ARS '            Eastern Regional Research Center (ERRC) in Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania, are            studying Hispanic cheeses to help producers meet the increasing demand            for them. Total Hispanic-style cheese production in the United States            jumped 52 percent from 1996 to 2001, when more than 102 million pounds            were sold, according to USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service.            In fact, it is one of the fastest growing U.S. food markets, outpacing            the growth of the cheddar and mozzarella markets.            It's Flavor, Not Fire                     Hispanic-style cheese does not mean hot-and-spicy cheese; other ingredients            make Hispanic dishes hot. In general, the cheeses are white or off-white            and moist. They taste like fresh milk. They become soft and creamy when            heated but do not lose shape, run, or separate into greasy solids and            liquids. Most cheeses are fresh, though some are aged. Many are mild            tasting and crumbly. Others are harder and have stronger flavor.                     Chemist Diane L. Van Hekken and colleagues in ERRC's Dairy Processing            and Products Research Unit are studying selected Hispanic cheeses made            in Mexico to better understand how specific processing techniques result            in their desirable qualities. They are looking at the cheeses' chemical            and physical makeup to learn how these properties relate to flavor;            texture, such as chewiness and stringiness; and function, such as the            ability to melt or be sliced. They want to find ways to duplicate these            characteristics by following U.S. practices and standards. Then, they            hope to apply the findings to improving cheese-processing techniques            in general.                     According to Van Hekken, there is not a lot of literature available            for researchers on the characteristics of these cheese types, and so            a main objective is to compile needed references.           In Search of Authenticity                     The researchers are looking at four specific cheese types. The first,            Queso Blanco, may be the most popular cheese south of the border. It            is soft and won't melt. Panela is mild, sweet, and crumbly. Asadero            is a smooth, yellow cheese that is somewhat tangy and good for baking.            And last, Van Hekken's research team traveled to Mexico twice, where            they are working with a collaborator to examine Mennonite-style cheeses            from the state of Chihuahua. These semihard cheeses—named after            the Mennonite settlers who introduced them to the region—are similar            to Queso Quesadilla and Menonita found in the United States.                     ""All these cheeses have been developed for specific purposes,""            Van Hekken explains. ""People can't cook a Mexican-style dish, for            example, with American-style cheese and expect it to taste authentic.            Restaurants that want their dishes to be traditional know this, and            they search for the right cheeses.""                     A sensory evaluation board (taste panel) at ERRC has been working since            May 2001 to define the flavor profiles of both raw and pasteurized cheeses.            MaryAnne Drake, a professor with North Carolina University's Department            of Food Science, helped initiate training for panelists to become human            instruments and to use a common terminology in describing what they            taste.                      The researchers also hope to improve the shelf life of Hispanic-style            cheeses, which will expand their marketability here and in foreign markets            and ensure high food-safety standards.—By  Jim            Core,  Agricultural Research Service Information Staff.

Consumers should not consume two products manufactured by Salemville Amish Cheese of Kingston, Wisc.    Products of concern are Salemville Amish Blue Cheese and Salemville Amish Gorgonzolla, both labeled as distributed by Dan Carter, Inc., Mayville, Wisc.  The cheese was offered for sale at various retail outlets throughout Indiana.  The cheese is sold in wedges (various weights) and in crumbles packaged in 4 oz. plastic tubs and 5-pound bulk bags.  Affected products carry freshness dates from March 11 through July 23.    Thirteen of 17 product samples taken indicate higher-than-normal levels of E.coli.  While the specific strain of bacteria has not yet been identified, testing has found no signs of what has become perhaps the most notorious of the strains of E.coli: H7:0157.    According to George Jones, Director of BOAH Diary Division, no consumer illness or complaints have been reported.    ""The potential for illness if someone was to consume these products is unknown: there are too many variables yet to be identified.  Test levels raise concern about this product,"" explains Jones.  ""We'll know more after Wisconsin official complete further testing and study at the manufacturing plant level.""

Some Hispanic cheese tastes like fresh milk and becomes soft and creamy when heated but doesn't lose shape or run. Other cheeses melt but don't separate into greasy solids and liquids. Hispanic-style cheese does not mean hot and spicy; other ingredients make Hispanic dishes ""hot.""   Some American companies are producing quality Hispanic-style cheeses from pasteurized milk, but they don't exhibit the full flavors, textures and cooking properties of those made from raw milk.   Diane L. Van Hekken, a research chemist at the ARS  Eastern Regional Research Center 's  Dairy Processing and Products Research Unit  in Wyndmoor, is studying the properties of selected Hispanic cheeses. She hopes to modify existing cheesemaking techniques or develop new ones to improve the shelf life of Hispanic-style cheeses. This will expand their marketability and ensure high food safety standards.   Van Hekken co-hosted a symposium at the  Institute of Food Technologists  annual meeting in June to discuss this growing market with other researchers and producers. A taste panel in Wyndmoor has been working since May 2001 to define the flavor profiles of both raw and pasteurized cheeses.    ARS is the  USDA 's chief scientific research agency.

STATE COMMISSIONER WARNS CONSUMERS TO DISCARD CONTAMINATED    CHEESE     NEWS RELEASE     Contact:  Jessica Chittenden           518-457-3136                      For Immediate Release     State Commissioner Warns Consumers to Discard Contaminated Cheese     New York - January 11, 2001 - New York State Agriculture Commissioner Nathan    L. Rudgers today warned consumers not to consume certain containers of Quesos    Zurita Mexican White Cheese, manufactured and distributed by Zurita Cheese,    649 Myrtle Avenue, Brooklyn, NY. Routine samples taken by Department inspectors    reveal the presence of  Salmonella , an organism which can cause serious    and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people and    others with weakened immune systems.    Healthy persons infected with  Salmonella  often experience fever, diarrhea    (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances,    infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream    and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e. infected    aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.    The product was sold in 14-ounce foil wrapped packages marked with plant #369630    on the top and an expiration date of January 30, 2001 stamped on the side. The    product was distributed throughout the Metropolitan New York City area. Zurita    Cheese is voluntarily recalling the product.   No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with this product.    Consumers who have purchased 14-ounce packages of Zurita Mexican White Cheese    are urged to discard all product or return them to the point of purchase.

Swissrose is assisting Hill & Valley Cheese, the State of Wisconsin, and the FDA in recalling the Colby Jack and Marble Jack cheeses manufactured by Hill & Valley Cheese, Inc. of Cashton, Wis.  Some of the cheese manufactured by Hill &Valley Cheese tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes.  The company received cheese from Hill & Valley on June 23 and June 28, 2000. Some of the Marble Jack cheese subject to this recall was converted into consumer items and distributed to consumers nation-wide under the Lost Creek Farms label.

Listeria monocytogenes is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, pregnant women and individuals with weakened immune systems.  Although healthy individuals may suffer short-term symptoms such as fever, headaches, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.

WISCONSIN CHEESE GROUP VOLUNTARILY RECALLS RED WAX HOOP CHEESE      NEWS RELEASE     Contact:  Wisconsin Cheese Group           800-332-6518                     For Immediate Release     Wisconsin Cheese Group Voluntarily Recalls Red Wax Hoop Cheese     MONROE, WI (November 22, 2000) - Wisconsin Cheese Group issued a voluntary    recall of its Hoop Cheddar Cheese after receiving notification that its supplier's    cheese may be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes. Listeria monocytogenes    can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or    elderly people, pregnant women and individuals with weakened immune systems.    Healthy individuals may suffer short-term symptoms such as fever, headaches,    stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea from listeria infection. Listeria    infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirth among pregnant women.    The cheese was distributed in 26 states under the ""Hoop Cheddar Cheese"" name    with various expiration dates. The Hoop Cheddar Cheese is sold as red waxed    wedges of yellow cheddar cheese in random weights of 12 oz. to 15 oz. No other    Wisconsin Cheese Group products are affected.    The Hoop Cheddar Cheese was labeled with weight/price stickers for sale at    retail stores. The cheese was sold at Walmart Stores in 26 states with ""Wisconsin    Cheese Red Hoop Cheddar Cheese"" on the weight/price stickers which have UPC    code 40008013632. The product was also sold at Kroger Grocery Stores with ""Kroger    Red Wax Hoop Cheese"" on the weight/price stickers which have UPC code 20396900461    on them. The Kroger product was sold at Kroger Stores in Tennessee, Mississippi,    Missouri, Arkansas and Alabama.    The Wisconsin Cheese Group has received no reports or complaints of illness    related to the product.

Wisconsin Cheese Group, Kickapoo Valley Cheese    and Hill & Valley Cheese, Inc. are working with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration    and Wisconsin Department of Agriculture to assure an effective recall.
