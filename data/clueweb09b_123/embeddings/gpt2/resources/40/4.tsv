                  On the PSICC, we offer the angler many opportunities to experience              the fine fishing we have available. Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State.

opportunities to experience              the fine fishing we have available. Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .                             Please visit our               Whirling disease page  for information on how you can help us              prevent the spread of this pernicious parasite. As you use our site,              we hope you find much useful information to guide you in your              fishing exploits.                             Good Luck!

                  On the PSICC, we offer the angler many opportunities to experience              the fine fishing we have available. Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

                  On the PSICC, we offer the angler many opportunities to experience              the fine fishing we have available. Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

On the PSICC, we offer the angler many opportunities to     experience the fine fishing we have available. Our forests and grasslands offer both warm     and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse landscape.The PSICC manages over 2.3     million acres of public lands southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains     short-grass prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the Collegiate and     Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers     and streams, as well as hundreds of high mountain lakes. We are also the home of the rare  Greenback Cutthroat trout  ( Oncorhynchus clarki stomias ), the     Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally and by the State.     Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing opportunities on our forests is the     spread of  whirling disease . Please visit our  WD_webpage  for     information on how you can help us prevent the spread of this pernicious parasite. As you     use our site, we hope you find much useful information to guide you in your fishing     exploits.  Good Luck!

Each              tour must take responsibility to make only the minimum impact.                            These              common sense suggestions will help make the sport of winter touring              more enjoyable for everyone.                                 Respect Private Property                 Get permission to cross private lands.                   Pack It Out  Put                every scrap of trash in a bag and pack it out.                   Watch Wildife  From                a distance, avoid animal wintering grounds.                   Camp Without a Trace                 Camp simply; use stoves and foam pads.                   Be Sanitary  Use                areas away from travel and water; bury all waste.                   Know the Hazards                 Every person entering the backcountry is responsible for their own                comfort and safety. Know the symptoms of hypothermia, learn proper                route selection, become skilled with compass and maps, let someone                know your trip plans and be sure to check in when you return.                                 LEAVE ONLY TRACKS!                                 TAKE ONLY PICTURES!                                             As a user of National Forest lands, you have              responsibility for your safety during any activity you might              pursue.  The Forest Service does install signs and other information              at various locations where conditions warrant.  However, the size of              the National Forests and the variety of conditions present limits              placement of signs or other warnings and requires the use of more              general education efforts.               Hazards may include: weather conditions,              avalanches, landslides, caves, cliffs, falling trees/limbs, high or              rushing water, contaminated water, wild animals, becoming lost or              over-exerted, hypothermia, remnants of mining, excavation, tunnels              or shafts, decaying structures, equipment, and changing road and              trail conditions.  You may also be exposed to unreasonable acts of              others.               Be prepared for rapidly changing winter              weather and snow conditions .

We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .                             Please visit our               Whirling disease page  for information on how you can help us              prevent the spread of this pernicious parasite. As you use our site,              we hope you find much useful information to guide you in your              fishing exploits.                             Good Luck!

Each              tour must take responsibility to make only the minimum impact.                            These              common sense suggestions will help make the sport of winter touring              more enjoyable for everyone.                                 Respect Private Property                 Get permission to cross private lands.                   Pack It Out  Put                every scrap of trash in a bag and pack it out.                   Watch Wildife  From                a distance, avoid animal wintering grounds.                   Camp Without a Trace                 Camp simply; use stoves and foam pads.                   Be Sanitary  Use                areas away from travel and water; bury all waste.                   Know the Hazards                 Every person entering the backcountry is responsible for their own                comfort and safety. Know the symptoms of hypothermia, learn proper                route selection, become skilled with compass and maps, let someone                know your trip plans and be sure to check in when you return.                                 LEAVE ONLY TRACKS!                                 TAKE ONLY PICTURES!                                             As a user of National Forest lands, you have              responsibility for your safety during any activity you might              pursue.  The Forest Service does install signs and other information              at various locations where conditions warrant.  However, the size of              the National Forests and the variety of conditions present limits              placement of signs or other warnings and requires the use of more              general education efforts.               Hazards may include: weather conditions,              avalanches, landslides, caves, cliffs, falling trees/limbs, high or              rushing water, contaminated water, wild animals, becoming lost or              over-exerted, hypothermia, remnants of mining, excavation, tunnels              or shafts, decaying structures, equipment, and changing road and              trail conditions.  You may also be exposed to unreasonable acts of              others.               Be prepared for rapidly changing winter              weather and snow conditions .

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .                             Please visit our               Whirling disease page  for information on how you can help us              prevent the spread of this pernicious parasite. As you use our site,              we hope you find much useful information to guide you in your              fishing exploits.                             Good Luck!

However, it is              important that you recognize the following:               First, within the boundaries of most National Forests there is a              considerable amount of privately owned land. These private lands are              not open to prospecting or mining without the owner's permission.              National Forest visitor maps, for sale at all Forest Service              offices, show the general location of these privately owned tracts.                              Secondly, some areas of the National Forests are not available for              prospecting and mining, including panning for gold. The local              District Ranger's office can provide information about these              specific areas.                              Lastly, the more easily found mineral deposits have already been              discovered and 'claimed' by other prospectors. Entering onto these              claims for the purpose of prospecting or removing any mineral is              'claim jumping' or trespassing.                              Before you begin prospecting, you should check the local country              records for any claims in the area in which you are interested.              Then, you should check the area on the ground for any evidence of a              claim that may have been staked recently.                                             South Platte RD               South Park RD                                                                                                                                                                                      Recreation               |     Safety               |  Maps & Brochures               |  Passes & Permits               |  Fire Information               Policies & Projects               |     Research & Education              |     State & Private Forestry                 Just for Kids               |     Photo & Video Gallery  |   FOIA  |  Employment  |   Volunteers                                               Privacy Policy   |  Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)  |  Disclaimers   Online Translator                                                              Page last modified on: Monday, 27-Jan-2003 14:54:41 EST          Location: http://www.fs.fed.us/r2/psicc/recreation/prospect.shtml                                               Page Contact:  Webmaster
