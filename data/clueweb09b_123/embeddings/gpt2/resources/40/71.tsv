Somewhere on a desert highway She rides a Harley-Davidson Her long blonde hair flyin' in the wind She's been runnin' half her life The chrome and steel she rides Collidin' with the very air she breathes The air she breathes.  You know it ain't easy You got to hold on She was an unknown legend in her time Now she's dressin' two kids Lookin' for a magic kiss She gets the far-away look in her eyes.

What color are they now?  Do you think that you believe in yours  More than they do theirs somehow?

Your smiling face looked back at me.  I used to see you on every T.V.  Your smiling face looked back at me.  Then they caught you with the girl next door,  People's money piled on the floor,  Accusations that you try to deny,  Revelations and rumors begin to fly.    Now you think about reaching out  Maybe get some help from above.  Now you think about reaching out  Maybe get some help from above.  Reporters crowd around your house.  Going through your garbage like a pack of hounds,  Speculating what they may find out,  It don't matter now, you're all washed up.    You wake up in the middle of the night.  Your sheets are wet and your face is white,  You tried to make a good thing last,  How could something so good, go bad, so fast?    American dream, American dream  American dream, American dream.    Don't know when things went wrong,  Might have been when you were young and strong.  Don't know when things went wrong,  Might have been when you were young and strong.  Reporters crowd around your house.  Going through your garbage like a pack of hounds,  Speculating what they may find out,  It don't matter now, you're all washed up.    Don't know when things went wrong,  Might have been when you were young and strong.  American dream, American dream.

I hit the city and  I lost my band  I watched the needle  take another man  Gone, gone, the damage done.    I sing the song  because I love the man  I know that some  of you don't understand  Milk-blood  to keep from running out.    I've seen the needle  and the damage done  A little part of it in everyone  But every junkie's  like a settin' sun.

Nestled in your wings my little one  This special morning brings another sun  Tomorrow see the things that never come  Today    When you see me  Fly away without you  Shadow on the things you know  Feathers fall around you  And show you the way to go  It's over, it's over.

Don't let it bring you down  It's only castles burning,  Find someone who's turning  And you will come around.    Blind man running through the light of the night  With an answer in his hand,  Come on down to the river of sight  And you can really understand,  Red lights flashing through the window in the rain,  Can you hear the sirens moan?  White cane lying in a gutter in the lane,  If you're walking home alone.    Don't let it bring you down  It's only castles burning,  Just find someone who's turning  And you will come around.    Don't let it bring you down  It's only castles burning,  Just find someone who's turning  And you will come around.

Mother lyrics  Do you remember when I was a baby  Did I cry, did I cry  I only remember the days I was laughing  When you sang me sweet lullabies  When you sand me sweet bye and bye    Sometimes I wonder if you were an angel  Would you fly, would you fly  Or would you just hover right here by my side  Keeping me warm and dry  Keeping me safe by you side    Mother mother won't fall from grace  Light a room with the lines on your face  And if you were a river run dry  Well I'd sing you sweet bye and bye    All of the birds that land on my window  Sing your name, sing your name  When all of the time I am crying again  About how much the sky likes to rain  When I should be singing your name    And all of the flowers by the side of the road  They whisper your name while they grow  And if you were a river run dry  Well I'd sing you sweet bye and bye               Send ""Mother"" Ringtone to your Cell Phone!              Browse Other   Kasey Chambers Lyrics     Rate this song     1       2       3       4       5       6       7       8       9       10                                 Kasey Chambers tabs  /    Kasey Chambers lyrics  /   Check  Mother lyrics  @ Lyricsbay.com            Watch  :  Kasey Chambers - Mother video                             Flash movie     Embed code for your page:     <object width='240' height='250'><param name='movie' value='http://www.layoutstar.com/images/elyrics/i/widget.swf'><param name='flashvars' value='l=k&b=kasey-chambers&s=mother'><embed src='http://www.layoutstar.com/images/elyrics/i/widget.swf' width='240' height='250' type='application/x-shockwave-flash' flashvars='l=k&b=kasey-chambers&s=mother'></embed></object><br><div style='width:240px;'><a href='http://www.wiredseek.com/ringtones/?id=wlyrics' target='_blank'><img src='http://layoutstar.com/images/elyrics/rg.gif' border='0'></a><a href='http://www.mp3raid.com/search/mp3/kasey_chambers.html' target='_blank'><img src='http://layoutstar.com/images/elyrics/mp.gif' border='0'></a><a href='http://www.videocure.com/music-videos/k/75c569e8ddfdd6add5c9d6f9ef5df54d.html' target='_blank'><img src='http://layoutstar.com/images/elyrics/vid.gif' border='0'></a></div><div style='font:normal 11px tahoma;width:240px;text-align:center;'><a href='http://www.elyrics.net' target='_blank'>Song Lyrics</a> | <a href='http://www.elyrics.net/song/k/kasey-chambers-lyrics.html' target='_blank'>Kasey Chambers lyrics</a></div>                The Mother lyrics by Kasey Chambers is copyrighted and eLyrics.net is featuring all  kasey chambers  music lyrics for non-commercial use only.
