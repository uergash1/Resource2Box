Apfel, Commissioner of Social Security,           Praises Senate Action and           Announces Implementation Plan           for the Repeal of the Retirement Earnings Test           Kenneth S. Apfel, Commissioner          of Social Security, today praised the United States Senate for its vote          of 100-0 earlier this week to eliminate the retirement earnings test.          The United States House of Representatives passed a similar version on          March 1 by a 422-0 vote. ""Beneficiaries who are 65 years young should          be allowed to contribute their energy, talent and experience to the workplace          without being penalized for doing so,"" said Commissioner Apfel. ""I know          that the President is anxious to sign this bill into law. I also want          people to know that SSA is moving to implement this important piece of          legislation as quickly as possible.""          The retirement earnings test          has been a part of the Social Security program since its inception when          there were 5 workers for every beneficiary. Demographics are changing          the dynamics of both the workforce and the Social Security program. Today,          there are three workers for every beneficiary and by 2030 there will be          2 workers per beneficiary. ""The earnings test is counterproductive in          an economy in which employers want and need the skills and talents of          older workers,"" commented Apfel. ""It is an outdated policy that discourages          healthy seniors from continuing to work past age 65 if they choose to          do so.""          The legislation, which is retroactive          to January 1, 2000, will affect around 800,000 beneficiaries who are either          working or are dependents of workers. In addition, there are about another          100,000 persons who have not filed claims for benefits because they are          working (or because they are dependents of workers). The legislation will          allow these people to receive benefits this year when they file claims          for benefits. Altogether, about $6 billion in benefits will be paid this          year because of the legislation. With the elimination of the earnings          test, each beneficiary affected by the legislation will receive, on average,          an additional $6,700 in benefits this year.          About 415,000 of the affected          beneficiaries (workers and dependents) have already had $1.4 billion in          Social Security benefits withheld because of the earnings test since January          1. If the elimination of the earnings test is signed into law by mid-April,          each beneficiary will receive a retroactive payment in May, averaging          about $3,500.          ""We are working hard to ensure          that Social Security beneficiaries who are affected by the new law will          have money in their pockets quickly,"" said Apfel. SSA will send notices          to all beneficiaries potentially affected by the earnings test shortly          after the bill is signed. The notices will tell beneficiaries about the          legislation and how SSA will implement the new law. If the President signs          the bill by mid-April, SSA will be able to make retroactive payments to          beneficiaries by early May 2000 and change monthly benefit payments to          reflect the new law by June 2000.          While there is a short-term          cost to eliminate the retirement earnings test--about $22 billion over          ten years, there is virtually no long-term cost to the Social Security          program to eliminate it.          ""This bi-partisan legislation          is an excellent example of how we can all work together to make positive          changes to the Social Security program,"" said Commissioner Apfel. ""We          can and must apply this same spirit of cooperation to strengthening Social          Security for future generations of Americans."" http://www.ssa.gov/rettest.html           (this link is no longer available)          (editor)                                                                                                 If you found this newsletter          helpful, please forward this issue of e-news to two or three of your friends.

The earnings test.                          1801.1        How is your amount of benefits generally determined?    Social Security benefits are meant to partly replace earnings you (or your family) lose because of retirement, disability, or death. Therefore, the amount of Social Security benefits you receive each year depends on whether you are fully or partially retired.          1801.2        What is the ""earnings test""?    We use the ""earnings test,"" also referred to as the retirement test, to:       Measure the extent of your retirement;       Determine the amount, if any, to be deducted from monthly benefits; and      Measure the work activity of other individuals entitled to benefits on your record and the amount of benefits payable to them.              1801.3        What beneficiaries are not subject to the earnings test?    The earnings test does not apply to you if you are:       Entitled to benefits because of a disability; or      Living outside the U.S. and your work is not covered by Social Security. In this case, the ""foreign work test"" applies as described in § 1823 .

If you didn't pay Social Security taxes on your government earnings  and            you are eligible for Social Security benefits, the formula used to figure           your benefit amount may be modified, giving you a lower Social Security           benefit.

Your annual Social Security Statement does not reflect adjustments based          on such pensions and offsets.                      Note:  Some government pensions  do             not affect your benefit amount when you apply on your own record .

This Statement can help you better                plan for your financial future. It gives you estimates of your Social                Security benefits under current law. Each year, we will send you                an updated  Statement  including your latest reported earnings.               Be sure to                read this  Statement  carefully. If you think there may be                a mistake, please let us know. That's important because your benefits                will be based on our record of your lifetime earnings. Remember,                the future's in your hands when you read your  Social Security                Statement .               Social                Security is for people of all ages...                It can help you whether you're young or old, male or female, single                or with a family. It's there for you when your retire, but it's                more than a retirement program. Social Security can provide benefits                if you become disabled and help support your family when you die.               Work to                build a secure future...                Social Security is the largest source of income for most elderly                Americans today. It is very important to remember that Social Security                was never intended to be your only source of income when you retire.                Social Security can't do it all. You will also need other savings,                investments,pensions or retirement accounts to make sure you have                enough money to live comfortably when you retire.               About Social                Security' future...                Social Security is a compact between generations. For more than                60 years, America has kept the promise of security for its workers                and their families. But now, the Social Security system is facing                serious future financial problems, and action is needed soon to                make sure that the system is sound when today's younger workers                are ready for retirement.                                        Today, there                are almost 36 million Americans age 65 or older. Their Social Security                retirement benefits are funded by today's workers and their employers                who jointly pay Social Security taxes—just as the money they                paid into Social Security was used to pay benefits to those who                retired before them. Unless action is taken soon to strengthen Social                Security, in just 15 years we will begin paying more in benefits                than we collect in taxes. Without changes, by 2042 the Social Security                Trust Fund will be exhausted.*By then, the number of Americans 65                or older is expected to have doubled. There won't be enough younger                people working to pay all of the benefits owed to those who are                retiring. At the point, will be enough to pay only about 73 cents                for each dollar of scheduled benefits. We will need to resolve these                issues soon to make sure Social Security continues to provide a                foundation of protection for future generations as is has done in                the past.

GX030-91-10450859	Committee on Ways and Means    Subcommittee on Social Security         For Immediate Release        Contact: Press Office 202-225-8933        July 8, 2002                 Subcommittee Explores Improvements in the       Social Security Disability Program                 Congress is working to meet the needs of individuals       with disabilities               WASHINGTON - On Thursday, June 11, 2002, the Ways and Means Social     Security Subcommittee will hold its third hearing to examine the challenges     and opportunities facing the Social Security Disability programs.       This hearing will focus on: (1) how the Social Security Administration (SSA)     defines disability; (2) how well the definition of disability in law, along     with SSA’s determination of what constitutes disability, addresses the     needs of today’s workers and beneficiaries; and the intent of these     programs.       During the first hearing, the Subcommittee heard an overview of     challenges to the programs. The second hearing focused on reasons for     delays, complexities and inconsistencies in the disability determination and     appeals process, and explored recommendations for change.       “Medical treatment, assistive technology and the nature of work itself     has changed significantly since Social Security’s disability programs were     created in the 1950’s and 1970’s,” Subcommittee Chairman Clay Shaw     (R-FL) said. “Its long past time for us to carefully and thoughtfully     examine how disability is defined to ensure the benefits provided today and     in the future continue to keep pace with the needs of our ever-changing     society.”                         What:           Hearing of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Social           Security                           Focus:            Examine the definition of disability in law and how it           addresses needs of individuals with disabilities.

This legislation would protect the nearly seven million Social Security and SSI beneficiaries who cannot manage their own financial affairs and have a ""representative payee,"" to safeguard their monthly benefits.   ""Despite the Social Security Administration's on-going efforts, certain Social Security and SSI program activities continue to be subject to fraud and abuse,"" Saxton said.    Over $465 billion in Social Security and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits were paid last year to over 50 million retired and disabled workers, their families and SSI recipients.   H.R. 4070, which passed 425-0, will:         >authorize the reissuance of certain misused benefits;     >add mechanisms to collect misused benefits and hold representative payees responsible for their actions;     >require enhanced oversight of representative payees; and     >enhance penalties for benefit misuse.   H.R. 4070 protects the integrity of social security programs and individuals by:         >protecting Social Security employees from harm while conducting their duties;     >expanding the ability to stop perpetrators of fraud through new civil monetary penalties;     >denying Social Security benefits to fugitive felons, and;      >preventing persons from misrepresenting themselves as they provide Social Security-related services.   ""With this legislation the House is attempting to help SSA fight persistent problems that drain resources and undermine the financial security of beneficiaries,"" said Saxton.                            ###"

Jo Anne Barnhart,        Commissioner of Social Security, has clarified the Agency’s policies        so that individuals receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) disability        payments, and Medicaid coverage, can continue to do so even if family income        rises due to a mother, father or spouse receiving special combat-related        supplements to their military pay.                              Commissioner Barnhart: President’s          Budget for SSA Shows Commitment to Programs; Confidence in Agency         President        Bush’s proposed $8.53 billion administrative budget for the SSA         is the largest increase submitted since we became an independent agency,        and recognizes our 5.1% increase in productivity last year. In view of the        current fiscal climate, with the demands of national defense and homeland        security, the budget clearly demonstrates the President’s support        for our programs, which touch the lives of nearly every American.                                    Commissioner Barnhart announces          our Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2003-2008         Reflecting        the Commissioner’s priorities -- service, stewardship, solvency, and        staff --  the Strategic Plan  provides a        guide for meeting the goals of the President’s Management Agenda and        the Government Performance and Results Act, and describes how the Agency        will deliver results for the American people.                              Report fraud, waste and abuse         Help        us prevent fraud, waste, and abuse  in Social Security programs and operations.                                      SSA’s FAIR Act Inventory       We’re        required by the Federal Activities Inventory Reform (FAIR) Act to inventory        the activities our employees perform that could be considered commercial,        and to share it with you.

If        you're eligible for retirement benefits, some  members        of your family  also can receive benefits.                      When you can retire       If you were born before 1938, your "" full        retirement age "" is 65. Because of longer life expectancies, the        full retirement age is increasing for people born after 1938. You can start        your Social Security benefits as early as age 62, but the  amount        you receive each month  will be less than if you start at full retirement        age.                      How your age at retirement affects          how much you receive          Use our  online          Benefit Calculators  to see how much you can collect at different ages.          Talk to a Social Security representative the year before you plan to retire--it          may be to your advantage to start your retirement benefits before you          stop working.                                     Retirement benefits and divorce       If you are  divorced         after at least 10 years of marriage, you can collect retirement benefits        on your former spouse's Social Security record if you are at least age 62        and if your former spouse is entitled to or receiving benefits. If you remarry        before age 60, you generally cannot collect benefits on your former spouse's        record unless your later marriage ends.                              Benefits for children of retirees       Social Security        Dependents' Benefits  are payable to your unmarried children under age        18, or age 19 if they're still in high school, or to your children age 18        or over who were severely disabled before age 22 and who continue to be        disabled. Benefits can continue to be paid into adulthood if your child        has a disability that began prior to age 22.                              Working after retirement       Once you reach  full        retirement age  (65 for people born before 1938), there is no limit on        the amount you can earn while collecting Social Security benefits. Before        age 65, your payments may be reduced depending on the amount you earn.                                     Medicare and retirement       If you're getting Social Security benefits when        you turn 65, your  Medicare  Hospital        Benefits start automatically. If you're not getting Social Security, you        should sign up for Medicare close to your 65th birthday, even if you aren't        ready to retire.                               Leaving the United States       If you're a United States citizen, you can travel        or live in  most foreign countries         without affecting your eligibility for Social Security benefits. If you        work outside the United States,  different        rules  apply to whether you can get your benefit checks.                              How to Apply for Retirement Benefits         You can file:                   Online using our  Internet Social Security            Benefit Application           By phone, mail or in person at any Social Security office.
