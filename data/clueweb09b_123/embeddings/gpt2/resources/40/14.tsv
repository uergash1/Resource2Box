Wednesday December 31, 2008   As we look ahead to 2009, I know many jewelry designers are thinking of expanding on their jewelry techniques, and one way to do this is to explore and experiment with materials they may have not used before or have had very little experience using. I know for me, I am hoping to work more with metal and fiber, maybe even finding ways to incorporate them together into designs. I'm also interested in working more with resin. What about you? Take the poll, and feel free to leave a comment or two, especially if there's a medium I did not include for consideration in the poll.         Comments  (5) Permalink   New Year's Resolutions for Jewelry Designers   Tuesday December 30, 2008   2009 is almost here, so it's time for some self-reflection. I know that not everyone is into making New Year's Resolutions, but even if you don't want to call them that, maybe goals or future objectives might be a good way to think about how you'd like to tackle your jewelry making in 2009. I think it is always a good thing to take some time to think about what you have been doing when it comes to your hobby, life, work, etc. and how you can improve your approach.    I've put together a poll below using some of my own ideas and also those collected from a similar  post over at the forum . Thank you to all the forum members who contributed to helping me create the poll. I think many of us have a lot of the same objectives for 2009, but if not, feel free to include yours in the comments.

Comments  (0) Permalink   Favorite Jewelry Projects for 2008   Friday December 26, 2008   Before I head into 2009, I thought it might be nice to look back briefly at 2008 and some of my favorite jewelry projects. These are the top 10 picks from my jewelry box:    Fine Silver Link, Pearl, and Crystal Earrings : I wear these a lot because they pretty much go with everything, and I like the idea that it combines so many different media: metal clay, pearls, crystals, wire, and chain.    Queen of Hearts Metal Clay and Crystal Earrings : This is another metal clay favorite of mine. I wear black pants a lot (for obvious reasons), and these have just a touch of black. I have gotten a lot of compliments on them.    Crystal Amethyst Heart Bracelet : I made this bracelet very early in the year, and it's still a winner in my jewelry box!    Raku Bead and Hemp Necklace Tutorial : Another piece I get compliments on is this hemp and lampwork Raku bead necklace. Since making this one, I've made a few similar ones to give as gifts.    Purple Pearl & Opal Cube Earrings : Of course, I needed some earrings to go with the above necklace, and these fairly long earrings are great with it or teamed with just some simple sterling jewelry.    Puzzle Piece Brass & Crystal Earrings : I like experimenting with unusual jewelry components, so these puzzle piece earrings were fun to make, and I like wearing them too. They definitely get noticed.    Silver and Crystal Autism Adjustable Puzzle Necklace : I made this necklace as well as  a matching pair of earrings  as a special request for someone, and I have yet to make this for myself, but I have the same charms set aside for moi as well as a gold-tone set as well.     Glass Frame Poetry Pendant : Emily Dickinson is my favorite poet, so this mixed-media pendant project was an instant favorite of mine as well.    Blue Resin and Crystal Hoop Earrings : Along with these earrings which I used prefabricated resin components for, I have also done some experimenting making my own resin items, and I hope to do more of this in the coming year.     Amazing Butterfly Crystal Dangle Hoop Earrings : Finally, this is one of my latest projects so it is one of my favorites. These are easy to make and light-weight, so they are very wearable as far as comfort. They are also neutral enough to go with anything, but the aurora borealis finish on the butterfly beads make them really sparkle.

TAKE OUR READER SURVEY! Since 1971,  Rock & Gem  has been the leading magazine for the lapidary and mineral hobbyist. Not a trade journal and not a scientific dissertation, it speaks to the average rockhound, providing just the right blend of entertainment and satisfying information. Armchair hobbyists and diehard diggers alike will find something to enjoy in each issue.  Steve Decker photo Lifetime hobbyist and Carnegie Award winner Bob Jones heads up a group of experienced and knowledgeable contributors. Bob's light-hearted style brings readability to in-depth articles on minerals, classic deposits, and collecting trends. His Frugal Collector series helps collectors learn to identify mineral bargains, and his affiliation with the Tucson Gem & Mineral Society provides a behind-the-scenes look at the year's biggest and best mineral show and sneak previews of the show's theme and featured exhibits.  Robert Beard and Kenneth H. Rohn are among our regular field trip writers. They ferret out the collecting spots that deliver the goods and give you clear directions to an enjoyable outing. Field trips range from day-long family-friendly outings to extended-stay adventures in the great American wilderness.  Diane Prokop and others contribute fun and challenging projects for lapidaries of all skill levels. Not sure what to do with the gems from your last field trip? Step-by-step directions will soon have you tumbling, polishing, faceting, and making jewelry like a pro.  Regular columnists William A. Kappele, Steve Voynick, and Jim Perkins share their insights on everything from lapidary techniques to the science of minerals.   We know that our youth are the key to continued growth in the hobby. Our monthly children's feature, Rock & Gem  Kids,is designed to appeal to a younger generation with short, interest-catching articles, kid-sized projects, puzzles, and a chance to win a prize.  You don't have to stop at just reading  Rock & Gem . There are plenty of opportunities to contribute, as well. Share your faceting knowledge by submitting a design to our Many Facets column, show off your lapidary skills by entering our Craftsman of the Month contest, or share your comments through our Field Notes section. Our readers are also our writers, contributing full-length features and project articles. Click on the Writers' Guidelines button to get started on your own submission.

The Owyhee Gem and Mineral Society and the Mountain Home Gem Club also participated in this field trip. I guess a lot of people were excited about this trip as much as I was since this was one of the largest group of a field trip this year or maybe a lot showed up because the 2008 rock collecting season is about to come to end.   A couple of weeks earlier I had made arrangements to ride with Gene Alvey on this trip. Friday evening I wanted to drive by his house so I wouldnt be searching for it in the dark Saturday morning. As I drove by I saw that gene was outside loading his truck already. I stopped and talked about the coming trip for a while before heading out to the store to get supplies. A few hours later I had everything ready to go and loaded in the car.

I arrived at Jasons house in Boise around 9:15. Before we hit the road Jason showed me some of his recent tumbled pieces and an Arbor that he recent acquired from Tony Funk, A.K.A. Catmandewe. We talked about rocks for almost an hour before we head out to Mountain Home.   Finding the rock and gem show was quite easy; finding information on it was not. Once I found where the show was being held I looked it up on Google Maps. We were able to drive directly there without getting lost. When we arrived the first thing that caught our attention was a Genie that was setup outside with nobody around it. Jason jokingly said that we should throw it in the trunk, take off and forget the show. I thought to myself wow a genie would be nice to have before parking the car.

I already had a 10 saw but this one had the vice that I was missing and the seller was only asking $80. I quickly called and made arrangements to look at this saw. When I arrived the seller told me that a bracket that held the auto feed motor in place was broken so he would sell it to me for $50. I took one look at the saw and told him I would take it. I could hardly keep from doing a happy dance as we loaded it my car.

I have worked with wonder stone a couple of times and found it to be a very porous material. This material does not take a polish at all. To overcome this polish issue I used spray fixative that can be purchased at art and craft supply stores. I still shaped and sanded the pieces to get a smooth surface before applying the spray fixative. I often spray multiple coats over many days rotating the material as need to be sure I cover all areas of the rock.

The fossils contained in this agate are cat tails.  I have been told that some of the fossils are worms but I think they may be just cat tails turned on end.

You use the Mohs scale by testing your unknown mineral against standard minerals. Whichever one scratches the other is harder, and if both scratch each other they are both the same hardness. Knowing the hardness of minerals is very handy when selecting material to put in a tumbler.   The Scale below is a slightly altered version of the Mohs Scale That I made specifically for rock hounds.

Spotlight     Pet a Rock: How-to Rock Painting   By Patty Donathan   Rock painting is economical, fun and easy to learn. It's perfect for all ages and levels of ability. All you need are smooth rocks that you find or buy, regular acrylic craft paint, varnish and brushes. You can start with a simple ladybug and work your way up to more realistic dog and cat rocks.    I started painting rocks in 1999 after buying a book called “Painting Animals on Rocks” by Lin Wellford. I was intrigued that something so simple and unusual as a rock could be turned into an animal. I had the desire and passion to learn how to turn rocks into “3-D” animals. You actually take the whole rock and make it look like an animal. It helps to have the correct shape of a rock for some animals, but the easy to find round or oval shaped rocks make great cats, dogs and other animals.    I created my rock painting Web site, Pet A Rock, to share pictures of rocks I painted and provide information called “How To Paint — Step by Step Pictures for the Beginner.” I took step-by-step photos of how to paint a rock and typed up instructions for various projects. You'll find FREE instructions for a raccoon, hosta plant, colt, rabbits, gnome hut, house, barn, daisy plant, and skunks.    I also have sections called “Books To Help You Paint,” “How To Repair a Damaged Rock,” and “Supplies For Rock Painting.” Although I have a lot of free information on my Web site to help anyone learn to paint rocks, I also wrote a “Rock Painting Tips” book for those who want extra information.    Along with rock painting, I started collecting memorabilia related to the old 70's Pet Rock. There is a section showing pictures of the original pet rock, the manual it came with, and more!    Rock painting has allowed me to make a nice little home business for myself. Once I felt confident and built up my inventory of painted rocks, I started selling them at craft shows. Before long, people asked if I could paint their pet on a rock. Since my goal was always to be able to do custom pet orders someday, I nervously accepted my first order. The customer sent me photos of their pet and I painted it on a rock. With the help of my digital camera and the Internet, I'm able to send my customers progress photos of their pets as I'm painting them.

It is not a single show or held at a single  location.   The Tucson Show is an annual ""happening"" consisting of a  cluster of   several dozen major independent shows held by different organizations  and show   promoters at various locations throughout the city of Tucson,  Arizona.     Some of the independent promoters conduct gem and mineral shows in  other   cities at other times, but what makes the Tucson Show unique is the  world-wide   coming together in a common locality at more or less at the same time  during   the first two weeks of February. The Tucson Show has been growing and  evolving   since the 1950s when the Tucson Gem and Mineral Society founded and  held the   first and original show. Over the years the original  Tucson   Gem and Mineral Society Show , which often appropriately  referred to as   the  Main Event , has attracted numerous commercial, specialty  and   niche satellite shows, with thousands of dealers and vendors from all  over the   world exhibiting and doing business at these various shows.     The exact beginning and ending dates for each of the Tucson Shows  varies   with the yearly calendar and changes made by the various show  promoters and   organizers, but most of the activity occurs during the first two weeks  of   February. The Tucson Show seems to grow ever larger with new public  and   wholesale shows and locations added yearly. Some of the new shows  flounder and   are here one year and gone the next. However, once established, most  of the   participating dealers return to the same shows and locations year  after year.   Admission to most of the shows is free. A notable exception is  admission   charged for the public show held by the Tucson Gem and Mineral Society  in the   Tucson Community Center. This 4-day event harbors free lectures,  rockhound-oriented   organization meetings, numerous competitive and educational  mineralogical   cases and displays, a micromounter's swap room, a junior education  exhibit   with free tables and other attractions in addition to hundreds of  retail   mineral, fossil, gemstone, lapidary equipment and jewelry dealers.          Wholesale Shows vs Public  Shows     Some of the satellite shows are conducted as wholesale only venues.  Their   promoters typically require attendees to present appropriate resale  licenses   and business credentials at their registration desk prior to issuing  admission   badges and they employ security guards at building entrances and exits  to   screen the attendees for badges. Each wholesale show independently  establishes   its own criteria for admission and issues its own admission  badges.     The general minimum requirement is to show a resale tax license and   sometimes business checks or cards for your gem and mineral related  business   at their registration desk. Some of the wholesale only shows, such as  the  American   Gem Trade Association GemFair  trade show, are more stringent  in   screening attendees than others. The security at the AGTA show is so  tight the   AGTA admission badges are even electronically scanned at checkpoints  as a   counterfeiting safeguard. And the guards are armed.        Note that a copy of your uncle Ed's Arkansas resale license for  ""Ed's   Plumbing"" and his business card displaying crossed pipe wrenches  is   unlikely to impress the dealer registration desk personnel at any of  the   wholesale shows. On the other hand, ""Carol's Creations"" is  more   likely to pass registration muster at least at some of the wholesale  shows   such as  Gem   and Lapidary Wholesalers  where beads, gemstones, findings,  jewelry   making tools and supplies and so forth are trafficked.     Dealer registration lines and waits can get long, particularly so  on the   opening day of the particular show. Time is truly money for  professional   buyers during the Show, so many of the wholesale show promoters  provide   pre-registration services. Consult their web sites for  pre-registration   details.     If you're not a licensed reseller who is ""in the  business"" but   you are attending the Tucson Show with someone who is, it may be  possible for   them to obtain additional buyer or helper badges for you when they  register   for a particular show. If you know a vendor at a particular wholesale  show,   they may also be able to request a guest badge for you. Each of the  wholesale   shows sets its own policies in this regard.    Of course everyone wants to buy at ""wholesale"" prices,  but   something to understand about the wholesale shows and wholesale buying  at   Tucson in general is that admission badges aren't magic wands in that  regard.   The wholesale shows aren't portals to some secret parallel dimension  where   reality of price hinging on quantity is suspended for the badge  wearers. Each   wholesale show vendor and dealer autonomously sets their own  requirements for   minimum purchases and volume price structures. The bottom line is the  vendors   at the wholesale shows provide wholesale pricing on wholesale sized  purchases.     Another thing that's important to grok about buying at the Tucson  Shows is   that a good deal of ""wholesale"" (significantly discounted)  buying   also goes on at the public, or ""retail"" shows. Many dealers  and rock   shop owners also attend the public shows as buyers. In fact, the  public shows   at Tucson constitute major sources of supply for thousands of people  who are   ""in the business"" one way or another. It would seem the law  of   ""money talks"" is transcendent from jungle to jungle. Each  show   vendor and dealer at the public shows also autonomously sets their own   requirements for minimum purchases and volume price structures. If you  are   interested in purchasing just one specimen from a dealer at one of the  public   shows, (almost) all of them will be glad to oblige you. But don't  expect   ""wholesale"" (aka ""keystone"") pricing at that  level, at   least not until it is late in the Show and their best material has  already   been picked over and sold.         Many dealers showing and doing business at the public shows become  more   approachable and pliable regarding price as the total sale increases.  Three or   four specimens may put you in another ballpark, and ten another  ballpark yet.   ""Ask And Ye Shall Receive"" doesn't always apply of course,  because   there are many factors at play in determining price in any given  circumstance.   The ""fair market value"" is ultimately related to both the   availability of their material and the availability of your money. In  any   event, it seldom hurts to ask...         So Many Rocks and So Little  Time...     People often ask something along the lines of ""They will only  give me   three days off from work. So when should I come to Tucson and which  shows   should I attend?""     The Show is an ultimate marketplace and a primary attraction for  many   attendees are the opportunities to buy inventory for their businesses  and/or   specimens and items for their personal collections. One lesson of  Tucson is   that the most unique and highest quality items go fast. There are many  sets of   educated and appreciative eyes checking out the offerings at the  various   shows. The very first round of eyeing over generally goes to the other  dealers   exhibiting at the same show, as they tend to get about and visit with  their   neighbors first...     If the sorts of rocks that are efficiently purchased by the flat or  barrel,   or manufactured items such as tools and equipment or mass produced  gemstones,   jewelry and carved figures are of primary interest to you, sources at  Tucson   are deep. But if your buying interests focus on rarer and more unique  and   one-of-a-kind ""art-by-God"" type items like high quality  mineral and   fossil specimens, or ""art-by-man"" type items like custom  jewelry and   lapidary objects d'art, what it boils down to at Tucson is getting  there   before the other guy who sees it the same way you do (and of course  the depth   of your pockets).     If you're planning to make only a once in a lifetime, all-around   rockhound's pilgrimage to the Tucson Show, you'll seriously want to  consider   scheduling your time at Tucson to include at least a day at the  Main   Event  held in the Tucson Convention Center by the Tucson Gem  and   Mineral Society. By virtue of being conducted as an educational show  and   general hobnob in addition to providing a major commercial venue, this  one is   truly the reigning queen of the Tucson Shows.        Arthur Roe Micromounter Symposium at the Main Event     Unfortunately, if your time is limited to several days at the  Tucson Show,   attending the Main Event means coming hopelessly late in terms of  early   birding for bargains and unique pieces at the satellite shows. The  Main Event   is held from Thursday through Sunday on the last four days of the  Tucson Show.   Many of the satellite shows come and go before the Main Event even  gets under   way, wholesale shows in particular. On the first day of the Main  Event, what   remains in the still operating satellite shows has undergone several  weeks of   intense picking over.        If you are planning on attending the Main Event, one factor to take  into   consideration is Friday is traditionally kids day and young children  are   bussed in from all over the city on ""field trips"" for this  event.   For a good deal of the time on kids day the floor of this show is  unusually   crowded with large groups of children. It can get pretty noisy with  lots of   finger and nose prints on the cases.     Many of the dealers understandably move things back and barricade  the   entrances to their booths to keep young hands off of delicate and  valuable   specimens while kids day is underway. Unless you happen to be one of  the kids   on a field trip, there are probably better places to be than the floor  of this   show while kids day is underway.     While I certainly wouldn't want to miss the Main Event, it is  hardly the   only show in town, and it can be eclipsed by some of the more focused   specialty shows, just depending on your personal orientations and  interests.     An absolute must see for mineral or fossil collectors are the   Arizona   Mineral and Fossil Shows  held at the Executive Inn, InnSuites  Hotel,   and the Vagabond Plaza (formerly Ramada Inn). Other traditional haunts  of mine   during the Show include the  Tucson   Electric Park Gem and Mineral Show  (formerly the Congress  Street   Expo), the  La   Quinta Show , and numerous motel shows and seemingly endless  tents and   stalls along ""the Strip"" (South Freeway between Congress and  22nd   Streets), including the  Days   Inn Show .     Within the last several years several new public shows have come  online and   there have also been some changes to several other public shows.     A new public show of note for mineral collectors is the  Westward   Look Resort Mineral Show , located on Tucson's north side at  the   Westward Look Resort, 245 East Ina Road (One Mile East of Oracle  Road). This   5-day specialty show features upscale specimens offered by  approximately   twenty dealers including Wilensky Fine Minerals, Pala International,  Victor   Yount, Wayne Thompson Fine Minerals, Superb Minerals, Les Presmyk,  Robert Haag   Meteorites and others.     Another new mineral specimen oriented show is the  Fine   Minerals International Show  located next to the InnSuites  Hotel at 450   North Granada Avenue (Granada Avenue & St. Mary's Road).    The three outstanding Arizona Mineral and Fossil Shows have  expanded to   include a fourth location known as Mineral & Fossil Marketplace,  which is   located at 1333 N. Oracle Road between the Executive Inn and Vagabond  Plaza   (formerly the Ramada Inn). Unlike the other three Arizona Mineral and  Fossil   Shows which are held in motels, Mineral and Fossil Marketplace is a  tent show.   Superb Minerals of India has a major presence there with many tables  full of   affordable Deccan Traps zeolites and I've also scored some interesting   lapidary rough from Australian Outback Mining at the Mineral and  Fossil   Marketplace.     The La Quinta Show has changed, due to the La Quinta management  deciding to   quit it several years ago. Then after skipping a year, the La Quinta  Show was   brought back. However, the year it wasn't had the effect of displacing  the   former La Quinta dealers to other locations such as the Arizona  Mineral and   Fossil Show at the Inn Suites, with many electing to stay put in their  new   digs rather than return to the La Quinta.     The Congress Street Expo, a long favored haunt of mine for lapidary  rough   and tools, is no more. It has been moved and reincarnated as the  Tucson   Electric Park Gem and Mineral Show, with most of the anchoring  equipment and   tool manufacturers and suppliers such as the Graves Company, Alpha  Supply   Diamond Pacific, Crystallite and Kent's Tools migrating to the new  location at   the Kino Sports Complex south of the Holidome, 2500 E. Ajo Way (East  Ajo Way   Between Kino Parkway and South Country Club Road). A downside to this  new   location is its remoteness compared to the old Congress Street Expo  site,   which was just off ""the Strip"" downtown and within walking  distance   of the Tucson Convention Center. An upside is there is now plenty of  free   parking. The Tucson Electric Park Gem and Mineral Show is also  serviced by the   free show shuttle system, but getting out there and back from downtown  on the   show shuttle can take a while.                         Extinctions         Fossils  - Visit us in Room 104 at the  Vagabond         Plaza  Feb 1-9           Faceters.com          - Showings by Appointment Only During Tucson           Fabre         Minerals  - Visit us in Room 102 in the Lobby at the  Executive         Inn  Feb 1-12           The         Graves Company  - Visit us in the Graves Tent at the  Tucson         Electric Park Gem and Mineral Show  Feb 1-16           Mineral         of the Month Club  - Visit Us in Room B5 at the  Inn         Suites  Feb 2-15           The         Mineralogical Record Magazine  - Visit Us at Isle 13S in  the  Tucson         Convention Center  Feb 13-16           Miner's         Lunchbox  - Visit Us at Isle 3S in the  Tucson         Convention Center  Feb 13-16           Rock&Gem  Magazine  -         Visit Us at Isle 7S in the  Tucson         Convention Center  Feb 13-16           Rocks         & Minerals Magazine  - Visit us in the Lobby at the   Executive         Inn  Feb 2-15 and Isle 12S  Tucson         Convention Center  Feb 13-16            Starr         Gems  - Visit Us at 220 West Drachman across from the  Executive         Inn  Year Around           The         Sunnywood Collection  - Visit us in Room 119 at the  Executive         Inn  Feb 2-15           Top Gem Minerals  -  Visit Us         at the  Topgem         Warehouse  Jan 31-Feb 16 [Wholesale Only]           Tysons'         Fine Minerals  - Visit Us at the  Topgem         Warehouse  Jan 31-Feb 16 and Isle 12S  Tucson         Convention Center  Feb 13-16           V-Rock Shop  -  Visit Us at         933 N.

While the   Jewelry Show Guide  can help you plan for the trip, we do not handle registration  for either exhibitors or buyers.    TO EXHIBIT:   Please contact show promoters individually.    FOR BUYER REGISTRATION:    Most of the shows in Tucson are open to the public and sell to both wholesale  and retail buyers. However, some shows are only open to wholesale buyers and require  credentials in order to enter. Registration for these shows can usually be done  before or at the shows, but needs to be done separately with each show promoter.  The following shows require wholesale buyer credentials to enter: American Gem  Trade Association; Gem & Lapidary Dealers Association; GJX Gem & Jewelry  Show; Worldwide Gem & Jewelry Show, Gem & Lapidary Wholesalers at the  Holiday Inn/Holidome, the Rodeway Inn (Quality Inn), and at the Gem Mall; AKS  Gem Shows at the Howard Johnson; the Jewelry, Gem & Mineral Exposition at  Michigan Street and Simpson Street; J.O.G.S. International Exhibits; The Madagascar  Minerals Gem Show; the Tucson Southwest Jewelry, Gem, and Bead Show; and the 1820  Oracle Wholesale Show. These show promoters require one or more of the following  buyer credentials upon entering: resale license, tax certificate, JBT number,  business card, and/or photo I.D.        Shows that are open to the public and do not  require buyer credentials are noted on the map above with red markers.

Thursday January 8, 2009   One of my New Years resolutions was that I will make and share a new Christmas ornament each month of this year... I also resolved to use my stash rather than buy more fabric BUT I found the perfect red and white striped fabric for candy cane ornaments so I had to buy some.... especially since it was 75% off. Then I realized if I am going to share how to make the ornaments, I should share some of the supplies you may need so that you can take advantage of clearance sales too. Here's a  sneak peek at the ornaments I will offer directions for throughout 2009  and what you will need to buy   Comments  (0) Permalink   Way Back When   Thursday January 8, 2009   Many, many years ago, the 4H group I was a part of was named The Harmony Homemakers... BUT most of the time we called ourselves The Ripper Outers... because it seemed like all we did was rip out anything we had sewn.   No one likes to rip out because it is counterproductive to getting the project completed but we learned a lot and learn to except our sewing to look good when we were done by ripping out imperfections. We also learned that haste makes waste when we tried to plow through with a seam ripper, ripping our fabric beyond repair.  [br]This week I am sharing  the best ways to rip out a seam and not damage your fabric and then resew the seam .

clueweb09-en0010-62-26215	                         Home | About                              Sewing Featured Article Sewing Fun Stuff  A Rainy Day Savior      Anyone who has children will know how testing rainy weekends can be! The videos have all been watched, the board games done with, and dont even mention baking a cake!   For a change of pace, why not try sewing fun stuff that together, will help educate your kids to learn something new, as well as giving them something that they can be proud enough of to take to show and tell at school the following week. There are a number of easy  but fun  projects that anyone of any age can learn  and who knows, Mom or Dad may have a great time too!    Teaching The Basics   Before you get into sewing the fun stuff, make sure you teach each child the importance of safety using the pins and needles, and how to do a basic stitch, practicing on a piece of material.     If you can afford to, give each child their own little sewing kit, as this may give them a sense of importance and an encouragement to sew more often. However between projects, it may pay to store these kits in a safe place out of reach  random pins and needles on the floor arent a lot of fun for anyone!   Pin Cushions  Great Place To Start   Pin cushions can be a great starter project as these are simple, quick and easy to make. As well as this, when the project is finished, it can be added to the childs sewing kit for future use.   All that this project requires is a scrap of fabric, some stuffing, and a needle and thread. Sew a shape of the material together like a pillow (a square is easiest however you can also sew a circle, triangle or otherwise), leaving a small section open for the filling. Stuff the shape, sew up the hole, and youre done.   Decorate Shirts And Bags   Decorating shirts and bags is another was of making sewing stuff fun, as it can get your childrens creative juices flowing and creates an end result that they can wear. Rather than sew the whole shirt or bag, buy a plain t-shirt or bag from a second hand store or department store, and decorate with fun sewing stuff like patches, buttons, felt or fabric paint.   Fabric paint is an excellent option for younger children, as there is no sewing required whatsoever  which means no pins, needles, or chance of needless accidents.   Quilts  Easier Than You Think   If your kids find sewing stuff fun, and they get the basic stitches down pat, an easy project to take on is the humble patch work quilt. All you need is an old quilt or blanket, needle and thread, and a bag of rags. Sift through the rag bag, sorting out the patches and materials that you like, then starting from one corner of the blanket, stitch the patches on, over-lapping each one as you go. These long-term projects will not only keen them occupied, but it will help teach your kids commitment, and give them a sense of satisfaction when they finish.

When people think of sewing, many think of different things. In the     broadest sense, the term “Sewing” denotes the use of thread and     needle in a much wider range of activities and needle arts. “Sewing”     may be divided into two categories:      1. Hand Sewing Arts      2.Machine Sewing Arts.            Machine Sewing Arts.          The focus of this book as well as Sewing Answers. Com is Machine     Sewing Arts.

These include: Clothing Construction, Embellishment, Quilting,     Heirloom Sewing, Home Dor, and Crafting. The common thread linking     all of these needle arts is the sewing machine. Each of these areas     of sewing arts uses the sewing machine in slightly different ways     and apply it on different kinds of projects, but all of them use the     sewing machine.

Once clothing construction was considered an absolute necessity, but     today it is part of the best hobby in the world. Yes, you can save     money. Now you can make your own clothes so they truly fit and look     good on you. Instead of paying a thousand dollars for a dress, you     can make it for a couple hundred. Instead of having to wear the same     thing everybody else is wearing, you can create you own fashion     statement with a one of a kind, Wow!           The personal touch is yours to make. You can purchase ready made     clothing which often do not fit, and make the alterations for     perfect fit. You could have it altered at seventy five to a hundred     dollars, or do it yourself for free. Imagine buying a hundred dollar     suit with a missing button, or poor fit for just a few dollars on     clearance. You can quickly and easily turn that reject into a     treasured suit.

This is the world’s greatest hobby. It is not as much a matter of     cost, you could hire a professional and pay thousands. But nobody     can take away the feeling of pride you have when you know, you did     it yourself.           You can make pillows, throws, wall hangings, table covers, afghans,     Christmas tree skirts, curtains, draperies, window treatments, chair     dresses, and more. You can make your home truly special.                Embellishment          Embellishment is sewing that enhances ordinary items such as     Clothing and Home Dor items with Appliqu Embroidery, And Special     Thread Applications.
